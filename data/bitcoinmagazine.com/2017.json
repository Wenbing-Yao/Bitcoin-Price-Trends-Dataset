{"title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: After Giddy Heights, Bitcoin Sees a Steady Decline in Price", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-price-analysis-after-giddy-heights-bitcoin-sees-steady-decline-price/", "birthday": "Dec 20, 2017 5:36 PM EST", "date": "2017-12-20 22:36:00", "content": "In the days leading up to the various bitcoin futures markets opening, bitcoin saw a push to fresh all-time highs near $20,000. However, shortly after reaching these values, the market saw a steady decline in price as demand dwindled and supply began to dominate the market. In the last bitcoin market analysis, we discussed a possible distribution phase for bitcoin and a potential hypodermic breakdown of the strong, parabolic trend the market has seen. Let\u2019s take a look the latest developments:Figure 1: BTC-USD, 1-Hour Candles, Distribution UpdateOne troubling aspect of this current price trend is the high volume leading into all the dips, and the low volume on the price rises. This price action shows both the diminishing demand in the market and the overwhelming supply that is beginning to take dominance in the market. Currently, bitcoin is perched on a potential part of the trading range called \u201cLast Point of Supply\u201d (LPSY): this offers a final opportunity for the large players who have not exited the market to finally exit before an ultimate correction. As discussed in the previous article, there is a strong, aggressive trend called the hypodermic trendline:Figure 2: BTC-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Hypodermic TrendlineThe hypodermic trendline represents a break outside of the parabolic envelope that dominated the market trend for over three years. The hypodermic trend also represents an aggressive price trend that is fairly difficult to maintain because of the demand required to keep the price aloft. Currently, the price is sitting below this trendline and has rejected its initial test of the trend. At the moment, BTC-USD is testing the support of the trading range (shown in blue) and is systematically going through support tests as the market finds new lows. A breakdown of this hypodermic trend, and a possible breakdown of this trading range, could easily send the market down to test the parabolic curve (shown in black):Figure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro TrendThere is likely to be very strong support along the parabolic trend that will stifle any potential price drops. As always, it\u2019s important to watch the volume with the price growth or drops to confirm the likely direction of a move. As we test new lows, any volume growth will likely signal a continuation of the downtrend and ultimately have us testing the lower boundaries of the trading range.Summary:Bitcoin is potentially at its Last Point of Supply as it begins to test new lows in its current downtrend.Bitcoin broke below the hypodermic trendline, which usually signals a breakdown in trend.Support will be found along the lower boundary of the trading range and will likely slow down any potential price drops.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

(tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\n\u201cForkcoins,\" or \u201cInitial Fork Offerings\u201d \u2014 alternative coins that \u201csplit off\u201d from Bitcoin \u2014 are all the rage right now.The latest trend in the cryptocurrency world was kicked off last summer with the launch of Bitcoin Cash. The Bitcoin offshoot is a top 3 cryptocurrency by market cap according to websites like Coinmarketcap. Perhaps even more importantly, it is now offered by some of the world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin exchanges and wallet providers, including Coinbase, Bitstamp and Blockchain. The second Bitcoin offshoot, Bitcoin Gold, also claimed a top 10 cryptocurrency spot seemingly out of nothing. Perhaps unsurprisingly, therefore, a series of new forkcoins has been announced over the past couple of weeks, ranging from Bitcoin Diamond to Lightning Bitcoin to United Bitcoin and many more.Since this week, anyone can easily create their own forkcoin with the click of a few buttons. Forkgen lets users tweak Bitcoin\u2019s parameters and other properties to fork into a unique Bitcoin offshoot by simply filling them in on a user-friendly website. The service is created by a pseudonymous developer who simply goes by the name \u201cOne,\u201d who is assisted by \"Two,\" Forkgen\u2019s \"social media intern.\u201dTwo told Bitcoin Magazine that the service intends to democratize the creation of Bitcoin forks.\u201cEven leading developers have shown it is too hard to create forks of the Bitcoin blockchain without making critical errors,\u201d Two said, referring to the recent failed SegWit2x launch. \u201cForkgen creates a level playing field where anyone can easily create working forks. Then it reduces to a much simpler problem of marketing your new altcoin. More people are good at that part.\u201dIntroducing Bitcoin Magazine CashTo test the service, Bitcoin Magazine decided to create our own Initial Fork Offering.Right now, Forkgen lets users pick a name and three-letter-ticker for their forkcoin, as well as a block weight limit and a block height for the fork to take place. Additionally, Forkgen users can choose whether they want to implement replay protection to ensure no one accidentally loses their forkcoin. Further, they can opt for a mining difficulty reset to make new coins easier to mine at first. Forkgen users can also pick the letters and numbers to start the coin addresses and private keys with \u2014 and they can decide how much they want to tilt the Bitcoin logo to distinguish it from the original, like Bitcoin Cash did.Given these tools, we designed our forkcoin: \u201cBitcoin Magazine Cash,\u201d with the ticker \u201cBMG.\u201d We opted for strong replay protection and a difficulty reset, to make the coin as usable as possible. The Bitcoin Magazine Cash protocol will have a block weight limit of 20120501, an ode to Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s launch date (May 2012), which is also five times bigger than Bitcoin\u2019s limit. Addresses will start with a B or an M, and private keys with an i. Finally, the logo will be tilted 45 degrees counterclockwise, for no particular reason.Bitcoin Magazine Cash forked away from Bitcoin at block 500400: a couple of hours before publication of this article. Anyone who held Bitcoin private keys at 12 PM UTC on December 21, 2017, has now been awarded their free BMG. It should be possible to claim these coins with the Bitcoin Magazine Cash software and your Bitcoin private keys \u2014 though we don\u2019t actually recommend this (for reasons explained below).As of yet, it unclear whether any exchanges will support the fork, but Two suggests that all of them really must:\u201cExchanges should be obligated to split and distribute all arbitrary fork coins despite the systems expense and security risk. Who are they to decide what makes one fork more legitimate than any other?\"Interactive Performance ArtAlthough the service should work, on its website Forkgen describes itself as \u201cinteractive performance art.\u201dA play on Coingen, a now-defunct altcoin generator, Forkgen emphasizes how easy it is to create Bitcoin forks, that \u2014 like the thousands of altcoins out there \u2014 in the end are of questionable relevance. Where Coingen was created during the first big altcoin boom of 2013 and 2014 that birthed Bitcoin codebase forks such as Dogecoin, Vertcoin and Viacoin, the recent trend of forkcoins is really the same thing, the Forkgen project seems to suggest.Two ardently denied Forkgen is something akin to joke. \u201cThis is VERY SERIOUS. Read the FAQ,\u201d he said. \u201cForkgen is the embodiment of Satoshi\u2019s True Vision\u2122 where if big blocks are good for scaling then many chains are even better.\u201dInstructions and DisclaimersBinaries for Bitcoin Magazine Cash (BMG) can be downloaded here for Windows, Mac and Linux.

For example, Nexus features SHA-3 cryptography with 571-bit keys, which is believed to offer \u201cquantum security\u201d against future attacks based on next-generation quantum computers. Nexus is also developing a \u201c3D Chain\u201d (3DC) to address the current challenges of speed and scalability in the cryptocurrency industry.\u201cThe future of Nexus combines satellites, ground-based mesh networks, and blockchain technology to facilitate the formation of a decentralized internet,\u201d notes the joint press release. \u201cNexus is building the foundation to broadcast the blockchain and Nexus Network from space,\u201d adds the Nexus website. Basing the Nexus cryptocurrency in space can, according to the developers, protect it from interference from governments and corporations.\u201cWith Bitcoin\u2019s valuation at an all-time high, people are beginning to accept cryptocurrency as a real form of payment, but there are still problems with storage and ownership,\u201d Colin Cantrell, founder and lead core developer of Nexus, said in a statement. \u201cThe capabilities provided by the GalacticSky platform, combined with the flexibility of Vector\u2019s launch model, bring us one step closer to accomplishing our mission of providing the world with a decentralized currency that can be accessed virtually anywhere, anytime.\u201dWhile the Nexus cryptocurrency is not directly related to decentralizing the internet, its future infrastructure, based on satellites and mesh networks, is.Vector\u2019s GalacticSky platform, launched in 2016, is a \u201csatellite virtualization platform\u201d that offers customers the possibility to test new space applications with satellites already in orbit, before committing to the costly process of designing and launching their own satellites. GalacticSky customers will be able to reconfigure existing micro satellites dynamically and in near real-time, just like software-defined radio systems. In fact, Vector describes GalacticSky as a software-defined satellite platform. Established to develop affordable launch capabilities and in-orbit platforms for the micro-spacecraft sector, Vector has been described as a hot space startup and a potential SpaceX competitor. \u201cOver the last year, we\u2019ve made many advancements in order to solidify our standing as a leading nanosatellite launch company,\u201d said Vector co-founder and CEO Jim Cantrell, the father of Nexus\u2019s Colin Cantrell. \u201cHousing Nexus\u2019[s] cryptocurrency on our GalacticSky platform not only validates our proof of concept, but demonstrates how prolific this opportunity is for startups looking to innovate in space without the need to build their own satellite.\u201dJim Cantrell was also on the founding team of Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and Moon Express, the first private company to attempt to land on the lunar surface. Earlier this year, Vector and Citrix partnered to bring data center and cloud virtualization technology into space. Vector also announced a partnership with Astro Digital to launch one of Astro Digital\u2019s satellites in 2018.The ambitious plans of Vector and Nexus can be compared to the Blockstream Satellite service, which broadcasts real-time Bitcoin blockchain data from satellites in space. An important difference is that Blockstream doesn\u2019t operate satellites but uses existing commercial satellites as relays. An even more important difference is that, with the new initiative, the new and independent Nexus cryptocurrency will be really based in space, running on a blockchain distributed across across multiple satellites. Therefore, according to the joint press release, \u201cNexus is no longer tied to a nation-state and can create the backbone for a more decentralized financial ecosystem.\u201dIn a video, Colin Cantrell explains Nexus history, vision, current state and future plans. In another video, he provides an overall view of Nexus architecture and zooms in o scalability and quantum security aspects.", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 29}
{"title": "Op Ed: The Blockchain Education Network $100,000 Challenge", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-blockchain-education-network-100000-challenge/", "birthday": "Dec 28, 2017 1:55 PM EST", "date": "2017-12-28 18:55:00", "content": "Blockchain technology, as an overarching industry, has developed leaps and bounds from its geeky, white, cypher-punk roots of yore. (\u201cYore\u201d being 2015, as it was only a couple years ago that I was a total outlier for simply being a moderate liberal.)When I first entered this space, in earnest, at the end of 2013, I realized that the lack of diversity in \u201cBitcoin\u201d (as this industry was referred) was entirely untenable if we wanted a true crypto-economy to emerge. What good, I asked myself, is decentralized money, if only a handful of predominately young-to-middle aged male, Western libertarians used it? Maybe good for dark market e-commerce, but that was about it. At least, that was my thesis when I helped found the Blockchain Education Network, BEN, (then dubbed the \u201cCollege Cryptocurrency Network\u201d or CCN) at the start of 2014. What began as a hodgepodge of \u201cBitcoin clubs\u201d at a few universities in the United States, within months transformed into a global educational initiative at over one hundred high schools and universities in 20+ countries, on every habitable continent. Different clubs had different focuses beyond just education, from academic research and political advocacy, to entrepreneurship and trading. By the end of the 2014 spring semester, however, we had students from Cambridge (who gave out $100 in BTC to every single undergrad at MIT) to Sierra Leone (where we attempted to help curb the Ebola outbreak with bitcoin remittances). It was a wild ride, and, at a point when much of the world forgot about Bitcoin and nobody was focused on education, we brought young people into the industry in droves and gave them the tools to succeed\u2026 and BEN continues to do so, to this day. (Disclaimer: I stepped down as executive director a couple of years ago but remain chairman of the board.) Students who have been a part of BEN have been on the founding teams of Augur (Joey Krug and I met through the nonprofit), Bolt, Coinlist, IOTA, QTUM, and many more. Our members have gone on to work in politics, advocacy and education, and for just about every major blockchain company. BEN hackathons have spawned countless startups and brilliant new ideas. Free tickets we have provided to conferences and events have inspired hundreds of young people to enter this industry full time.As the founder of this organization, however, I have failed to serve it nearly as much as it has served me. After dropping out of school and founding Augur, I was too inexperienced an entrepreneur to balance my responsibilities at this nonprofit and my new startup. It has only been with the incredible work of the students and others who have selflessly volunteered their time to this organization that BEN has been allowed to continue flourishing \u2014 I take zero responsibility for its continued success. I would name names but there are too many amazing individuals to count \u2014 many of whom I have never even interacted with \u2014 as we designed the organization in the same decentralized fashion as Bitcoin. Without diminishing the extraordinary contributions of everyone who has been involved, the two executive directors who succeeded me, Dean Masley and then Jinglan Wang, must be mentioned. They took on a thankless job with zero salary and helped keep this organization thriving on a shoestring budget. Their commitment reverberated across the nonprofit.Moving forward, however, as this technology matures, so must the organizations that foster its adoption. Despite the remarkable work of the Blockchain Education Network\u2019s volunteers, the fact of the matter is that we need some paid staff to help organize students, events, conferences and media. For an organization that has done so much, it\u2019s fairly mind-blowing how little press it has received (my fault again). The organization needs resources to pay for administrative tools, conferences, resource development and curation, as well as student lodging and transportation to events. We want to make sure any young person, regardless of their socioeconomic background, has an opportunity to gain exposure to this revolutionary industry. Nobody should be left behind as this technology accelerates.Thus, I have made a $10,000.00 (USD, in ETH) donation to the Blockchain Education Network.Furthermore, I will match all other donations made over the next four days (through December 31, 2017), up to $100,000.00.The Blockchain Education Network is a federally tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization and is the best way to offset some of your mega crypto-gains this year! In true crypto fashion, give less to the government and more to the industry. The nonprofit accepts donations in dollars and crypto. Just send me your proof of donation on Twitter (@Disruptepreneur) or, preferably, email (Jeremy@blockchainedu.org), and I will match your contribution on the 31st. (I am currently in East Asia, so will be able to compensate for virtually all time zones.) Donation addresses may be found hereHere is my initial $10k (ETH) donation:If you\u2019re a student or academic looking to get involved \u2014 go to www.blockchainedu.org and join our Slack! If you\u2019re a company or organization and would like to partner with BEN \u2014 please do not hesitate to contact me about sponsorship opportunities for 2018. I can be reached at Jeremy@blockchainedu.org. When I first started BEN, I coined the term #GenerationBlockchain. As this industry matures, and more and more young people begin to think about opportunities in this space, it\u2019s incredibly important that we foster a community that enables them to connect with liked-minded students. We have the potential to create a generation of youth who think about blockchains as intuitively as Generation Z approaches email or social media. I believe this is how we lay the foundation for a true crypto-economy.PS.

He covers topics in healthcare, technology, travel and culture. He holds bitcoin and ether.\nThere are few people who have worked in the blockchain technology space for so long and maintained such a seemingly disinterested and skeptical perspective on the emerging technology as Tim Swanson. Through numerous books and a blog, Tim has shown a knack for going out of his way to do deep market research within the blockchain space.\nThis week on Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin, Tim Swanson, Director of Research at Post Oak Labs, talked with Epicenter\u2019s Brian Fabian Crain and Sebastien Couture.\nHis most notable work within the space has happened as Director of Market Research at R3, the first blockchain enterprise consortium for the financial services industry. During his time at R3, Tim assessed several hundred entities \u2014 companies, startups and universities \u2014 working on some type of blockchain initiative. His experience gave a full range of good, bad and ugly business operations and blockchain propositions that existed in the early stages of this industry. \nWhether you agree with his stoic perspective or not, it may be a good remedy for the mania that has resulted from Bitcoin\u2019s phenomenal price increase this year. As new investors flood in the crypto community and more and more people begin talking about blockchain technology, it\u2019s never a bad idea to be reminded of how the industry has developed.\n\u201cHistorically, we\u2019ve seen a lot of manias happen in tech: social media, solar panels, AR, VR, etc. I don\u2019t see the benefit in becoming a fanboy in anything at this early, early stage.\u201d\nOn the current state for the enterprise blockchain market\nSwanson proposed that there has been a significant shift of attention in 2017 from enterprise blockchain to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), due in large part to the amount of money that has been raised this way. Referencing the Gartner Hype cycle, Swanson believes blockchain enterprise adoption is currently in the \u201ctrough of disillusionment.\u201d This stage comes after the initial peak of expectations where interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. This is also where many producers of the technology either give up or receive continued investment for improving the products to the satisfaction of early adopters.\n\u201cThe problem as a whole for the enterprise blockchain space is that it hasn\u2019t managed any of the expectations it initially set out to accomplish. In the beginning, there were brash claims like putting the entire United States equities market on a blockchain in less than a year. Over time, it became clear that something like that was not possible. Because of the unmanaged expectations coupled with the retail enthusiasm coming from the consumer side seeing how blockchain could help them, where in reality, enterprise is a long-term cycle and build-out, many people lost interest once they realized they could make money much faster through ICOs.\u201d\nSwanson listed a number of startups working on the enterprise blockchain side in New York, London and the west coast, including Digital Asset, ConsenSys Enterprise, Cobalt DL and Ripple, among others, as well as Clearmatics and R3, both of which Swanson still advises.\n\u201cIf you look at funding for those companies \u2014 as an aggregate they\u2019ve raised maybe $400-450 million dollars. For comparison \u2014 and it\u2019s not an accurate comparison \u2014 ICOs in the month of June raised over $600 million dollars. It was a shift in enthusiasm from people who wanted to get very rich, very quickly. The fact of the matter, even for ICOs, is that you can\u2019t bypass the requirement-gathering necessary to build a platform that can work with existing institutions and existing regulatory and industry requirements.\u201d \n\u201cYou can\u2019t just build an aeroplane, convert it into a helicopter then sell it to a bunch of helicopter enthusiasts. Ultimately, somebody will have to build applications and that\u2019s why building an ecosystem and community is so important.\u201d\nWhy Aren\u2019t There Any New Enterprise Blockchain Companies?\nSwanson attributed the lack of new enterprise blockchain companies to the difficulty new startups face in working against the existing competition within the space. Established companies have a head start in acquiring the essential ingredients for success in the enterprise blockchain space: capital and some kind of partnership with regulators or players of the existing infrastructure.\nFurthermore, Swanson suggested that most of the obstacles encountered by enterprise blockchain companies could be easily surmounted by larger players:\n\u201cLarge enterprises like Oracle, IBM, Sap, Microsoft have the capacity and budgets to acquire any of the enterprise startups. Oracle alone could acquire all the enterprise startups themselves and not blink much of an eye.\u201d \nTransitioning from Proof of Concept to the Pilot Stage\nSwanson stated that one of the most critical obstacles for enterprise blockchain startups to be mindful of are the principles of financial market infrastructure (PFMI). These are a set of standards adopted after the 2008 financial crisis which the international community considers fundamental to strengthening and preserving financial stability. \n\u201cThese principles are intended to prevent a snowball/domino affect where a local problem could potentially take down an entire system,\u201d said Swanson. Due to the nature of these principles and how they interact within existing financial infrastructure, changing legacy infrastructure by integrating a blockchain that does not comply with these principles is far more time consuming and costly. \n\u201cWithin these large corporations, you can\u2019t just turn off legacy infrastructure, then turn on your blockchain version and continue production. Things have to be run in parallel for a while. It takes time and talent.\u201d \nThe future of the blockchain in enterprise is not necessarily tied to more infrastructures, Swanson concluded. \u201cInstead of building out more infrastructure, I am much more interested in seeing applications built on top of existing infrastructure.\u201d\nWatch the full episode to hear Swanson on busting hype, the recent ICO spike and the rise of cryptocurrencies as a new asset class among other things.", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 22}

Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business, in the Washington Post. \u201cIt is only a matter of time before paper money is phased out.\u201dPhasing out physical cash \u2014 the reserve of drug dealers and black marketers \u2014 would be one of the main advantages of a national cryptocurrency, according to Harvey, since it would make it far more difficult for criminals to hide and launder money if all transactions could be recorded on the government\u2019s blockchain.The potential for privacy isn\u2019t considered a desirable feature for state-owned cryptocurrencies. On the contrary, as Harvey argues, the introduction of digital currencies would be partly motivated by the desire to eliminate the anonymity of cash. On the other hand, even in a future Fedcoin-like, all-electronic economy, it\u2019s easy to predict that there would be a strong black economy on the side, powered by privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ether, Monero and other emerging alternatives able to offer stronger privacy.\u201cDespite the negative press about bitcoin being used for illegal transactions, bitcoin is not anonymous, and criminals who use it often do not understand that their transactions are being recorded,\u201d notes Harvey. In fact, while a Bitcoin address isn\u2019t explicitly associated with its owner, blockchain network analysis can often de-anonymize Bitcoin users. To support law enforcement, companies like Chainalysis and Elliptic offer sophisticated blockchain network analysis tools and services to trace Bitcoin transactions back to their participants and de-anonymize users.In a recent presentation, Harvey defined Fedcoin as \u201ca digital USD currency where the complete history of all transactions is visible to the Fed via a Fed blockchain.\u201d That blockchain technology, initially thought of as a libertarian means to escape government control, could become a killer app for governments to have complete control over the citizens, and enforce compliance and tax collection, seems surreal to say the least.Indeed, as Saifedean Ammous, an economics professor at the Lebanese American University, told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cThe importance of Bitcoin is that it makes monetary policy and payment settlement according to predetermined software, free of third-party control. This defeats the point of having a central bank, and is anathema to central banks\u2019 mission, to control monetary policy and supervise money flows.\u201dIn the presentation, Harvey cited economist Kenneth Rogoff\u2019s 2016 book \u201cThe Curse of Cash,\u201d which proposes to gradually phase out cash, eventually leaving only small notes and coins in circulation, and move to electronic money, perhaps \u201ca government-run version of the virtual currency Bitcoin.\u201dWhile Rogoff is not persuaded that the \u201cpotentially disruptive\u201d technology of today\u2019s cryptocurrencies is sufficiently mature, he thinks a next-generation \u201cBitcoin 3.0\u201d could be a precursor to a government-controlled digital currency. \u201cIf the private sector comes up with a much better way of doing things, the government will eventually adapt and regulate as necessary to eventually win out,\u201d says Rogoff.Ammous disagrees with this sort of argument. \u201cThe only thing central banks can do with Bitcoin is accumulate it as a monetary reserve asset. At some point, central banks around the world will start asking themselves if they might be better off holding Bitcoin, with its apolitical monetary policy, than other countries\u2019 national currencies.\u201d\nCentral banks have as much to learn from Bitcoin\u2019s operation as horses have to learn from car engines. It\u2019s a technology meant to displace central control of money.\n\u201cThe Fedcoin idea was presented by David Andolfatto, Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, at the first P2PFISY workshop that I organized at the Bundesbank in Frankfurt, 2015,\u201d Paolo Tasca, executive director of the University College London Centre for Blockchain Technologies, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe idea of dispensing with cash in favor of alternative, more efficient means of payments is not new. Pre-1900 utopian thinkers devoted a lot of effort to finding a way to allow people to get rid of what Robert Owen called the \u2018insane money-mystery.\u2019 In more recent years, economists have also begun to study the implications of living in cashless societies, especially referring to the role of central banks and to the conduct of monetary policy.\u201dOther governments and central banks are considering their own versions of Fedcoin. Sweden\u2019s central bank, the Riksbank, is considering whether the country should introduce a purely digital form of government-backed money, perhaps using distributed ledger technology (DLT). The proposed e-krona would be a digital complement to cash guaranteed by the state, and work as a means of payment, unit of account and store of value. It\u2019s worth noting that usage of cash in Sweden is declining, and there are indications that the country could go entirely cashless in five years.The Riksbank isn\u2019t the only central bank to consider issuing its own digital currency. The central banks of Singapore, Papua New Guinea, Canada and others are considering similar moves. A recent research paper issued by the Bank of Canada, which considers a possible Bitcoin standard similar to the gold standard, is especially interesting. A discussion paper published by the Bank of Finland, which describes Bitcoin as a revolutionary, marvelous economic system, could indicate that the bank is considering with interest the possibility to someday launch its own digital currency. Even China\u2019s central bank is cautiously testing a digital currency.\u201cOther central banks (Bank of England, Bank of Canada and European Central Bank, among others) are studying the idea of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as a non-ordinary monetary tool that could improve the central banks\u2019 ability to stabilize inflation and the business cycle, and as a new payment channel that could permit tracing the network of payments and record the payment history of each individual,\u201d added Tasca.Another reason for governments to like the idea of a national cryptocurrency, according to both Harvey and Rogoff, is the possibility to strengthen the power of monetary policy to help manage the economy, for example by making it easier to impose negative interest rates.Harvey notes that, were the Federal Reserve to adopt its own cryptocurrency someday, it will become a major (and far less volatile) competitor to bitcoin and other digital currencies. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s not clear whether [F]edcoin would want that competition, and the Fed is in a position to impose a regulatory environment that tilts the playing field,\u201d warns Harvey. \u201cSo watch out, bitcoin.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 22}

Exactly two years later, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld his conviction and sentencing.Now in a landmark request, Ulbricht has appealed to the the Supreme Court (SCOTUS) regarding the Second Circuit\u2019s decision. A petition for a writ of certiorari has been submitted seeking a hearing for the overturn of the decision upheld this year by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Ross William Ulbricht respectfully petitions for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in this case.A writ of certiorari is a demand placed upon the lower court that upheld Ulbricht\u2019s conviction and sentence to turn over its records so that the Supreme Court may review them and determine whether further action is needed. The nine-member Supreme Court, which serves as the nation\u2019s final arbiter in legal matters, is very selective in the cases it hears, often pursuing those with national significance in order to establish precedence or to clarify contradictions in existing decisions. Four of the justices must vote to accept a case in order for it to be heard. The SCOTUS has a low reversal rate in Second Circuit Court rulings. Thus, even if the case is ultimately heard, there\u2019s no guarantee that Ulbricht will receive relief or be vindicated.Kannon K. Shanmugam is the counsel of record managing the appeal. Widely regarded as one of the top appellate attorneys in the U.S., Shanmugam was a former law clerk to the late Justice Antonin Scalia and has argued 21 cases before the Supreme Court.Ulbricht\u2019s court request highlights two important constitutional law questions. The first involves the Second Circuit codification of the government\u2019s warrantless collection of Ulbricht\u2019s internet traffic information. This case would afford the SCOTUS an ideal opportunity to address the Carpenter v. United States warrantless search case doctrine and how it may apply to Ulbricht\u2019s case. Second, the Second Circuit upheld the court\u2019s original decision to withhold information regarding corruption investigations into two agents from the jury. This decision impacted the sentencing guidelines -- a key element in the court imposing a life sentence on Ulbricht. Several justices have previously questioned whether this method of judicial fact-finding runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment. Reached by phone from Colorado, where she now resides and where Ulbricht is imprisoned, Ulbricht\u2019s mother, Lyn Ulbricht, said, \u201cWe are battling for Ross, love Ross and feel that he doesn\u2019t belong in prison, let alone a maximum-security facility. He\u2019s a nonviolent, wonderful person that never meant any harm to anyone.\u201d She asserts that the U.S. government\u2019s aggressive stance involving the drug war and nonviolent crimes has become quite alarming and believes that if the Supreme Court accepts her son\u2019s case, it will have far-reaching implications for constitutional protections of all citizens. Lyn Ulbricht says that she\u2019s grateful for the massive outpouring of support on Twitter in response to this Supreme Court filing. \u201cWe\u2019ve received lots of support from everyday people who know that this is not about drugs but about a much bigger-picture issue.\u201d She hopes that this case will shine a light on the unconstitutional encroachment of our government and the media sensationalism that supports it. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give up, and our family is not going to give up. This is about important constitutional protections and freedoms for us all. So we will continue to talk about Ross and our rights as American citizens.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 29}

An open-source developer edition of Chain Core is available to developers, with a testnet operated by Chain. Ivy was developed at Chain as a smart contract language for Chain Core. With Ivy for Bitcoin, which compiles to Bitcoin Script, Chain wants to make it easier for average programmers to write smart contracts for the public Bitcoin network.By design, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t include a Turing-complete programming language for smart contracts of arbitrary complexity. But this doesn\u2019t mean that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t support smart contracts. In fact, the simple, low-level, primitive operations included in Bitcoin\u2019s native scripting language (Bitcoin Script) can be exploited to write smart contracts of significant complexity. \u201cBitcoin Script does provide a set of useful primitives \u2014 signature checks, hash computations, and absolute and relative timelocks\u200a \u2014 and the freedom to combine those primitives,\u201d notes the Chain news release.However, Bitcoin Script is not being fully used by software developers, which according to Chain is due to \u201cthe relative difficulty of reading and writing Bitcoin Script programs, and of creating and using addresses from those programs.\u201d In fact, Bitcoin Script is a very low-level, assembly-like language, which doesn\u2019t offer the readability and ease of use of high-level programming languages. Therefore, most Bitcoin programmers limit themselves to simple applications, without pushing Bitcoin Script to its limits.The Chain developers want to change that with Ivy, a higher-level language that allows developers to create custom, SegWit-compatible Bitcoin addresses that enforce arbitrary combinations of conditions supported by the Bitcoin protocol, including signature checks, hash commitments and timelocks.Earlier this year, Chain released Ivy Playground, a tool for designing, drafting and testing smart contracts on a Chain Core blockchain network with Ivy. Now, Chain is making Ivy available to Bitcoin developers and releasing Ivy Playground for Bitcoin, which allows developers to design, create and spend simulated Bitcoin contracts. The playground includes preloaded smart contract templates for Bitcoin and developer documentation.A disclaimer states that Ivy is relatively untested prototype software and should be used for educational and research purposes only. \u201cDo not attempt to use Ivy to control real Bitcoins,\u201d warns the front-page document.Besides Chain, other developers are realizing that Bitcoin needs more sophisticated smart contracts and user-friendly programming environments for smart contracts. Recently, blockchain developer Blockstream introduced Simplicity, a new programming language for blockchain-based smart contracts, intended for inclusion in Blockstream\u2019s sidechains and eventually in Bitcoin. Lead developer Russell O\u2019Connor said that \u201cafter extensive vetting,\u201d Simplicity support could be considered for inclusion in one of the next releases of Bitcoin.In the Blockstream announcement, O\u2019Connor noted that Ivy\u2019s programming language development efforts may be suitable for being compiled to Simplicity. But it now appears that Ivy\u2019s progress toward these more sophisticated Bitcoin smart contracts is advancing faster than some might have expected.", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 29}

The steadily rising bitcoin price and market cap is a key, though not the only, indicator that a tipping point has been reached.Despite turmoil like ICOs being banned in China and South Korea, cryptocurrencies in general coming under scrutiny in other countries, and internal divisions and infighting in the Bitcoin community, the price of bitcoin continued its steady trend upward, accelerating in the last few months of 2017 despite naysayers.The following were some of Bitcoin Magazine's most popular \"good news\" stories from 2017 \u2014 only a small sample of the many breakthroughs that illuminated this remarkable year.5. Philanthropy Lives on the Blockchain2017 saw good news from Bitcoiners who went out of their way to share their cryptocurrency wealth through projects like the Pineapple Fund, set up by the pseudonymous \u201cPine,\u201d to donate 5,057 BTC to charitable causes like Watsi, the Water Project, EFF, SENS Research Foundation and BitGive.In October 2017, nonprofit BitGive itself launched its beta version of GiveTrack, a blockchain-based platform that allows donors to donate bitcoin to charitable causes and track those donations in real-time.At the end of 2017, hearts also reached out to Andreas Antonopoulos, who had not been able to hold on to his early bitcoins as he worked for years to advocate on behalf of the Bitcoin community. Bitcoiners sent donations of more than 100 BTC, worth about $1.7 million at the time, to show their appreciation for his years of devotion to the Bitcoin cause.4. DragonMint Helps Make Mining More DecentralizedAs Bitcoin mining becomes more challenging, it\u2019s also becoming more centralized around a few larger companies that have sufficient capital, the latest equipment and access to reliable energy sources. An estimated 70 percent of hash power produced on the network today is produced by Bitmain for their own or affiliated mining pools. In 2017, to offer some competition and shake up the market, Halong Mining launched the DragonMint 16T, with newly designed chips producing 16 terahashes per second. It claims to be 30 percent more energy-efficient than the most efficient ASIC miner currently on the market.3. A Major Step Forward in the Development of Bitcoin: SegWit Finally ActivatesAfter months of contentious debate in the Bitcoin development community, Segregated Witness (SegWit), a major technical innovation to the Bitcoin network, was deployed in early August.A Bitcoin developer, Shaolinfry, proposed a user-activated soft fork (UASF) so that users could set a deadline for enforcing the new rules instead of having the miners activate the soft fork.A number of factors contributed to SegWit\u2019s launch, including its successful deployment on Litecoin, the AsicBoost controversy and the contentious New York Agreement.The rising price of bitcoin can be attributed, at least in part, to SegWit\u2019s successful integration into Bitcoin\u2019s core software in 2017.2. Regulators Approve Listing Bitcoin Futures as Mainstream InvestmentsU.S. regulators recently granted approval for two investment funds to list and trade bitcoin, making 2017 the year that mainstream futures markets first accepted bitcoin as a legitimate investment.The world\u2019s largest derivatives marketplace operator, CME Group Inc. launched bitcoin futures trading on December 18. Also launching bitcoin futures trading in 2017 were Cboe Futures Exchange and Cantor Exchange, bringing investment in bitcoin to the fore.1. Price of Bitcoin Reaches $10,000 and BeyondDespite a year of turmoil and division, bitcoin reached a major milestone, breaking through the $10,000 barrier and rising above that in recent weeks.At the time of publishing, bitcoin was trading at around $14,500, more than 10 times its value at the beginning of the year. What some have (probably erroneously) called a bubble doesn\u2019t appear ready to burst anytime soon.The current bitcoin market cap, the value of all bitcoin in existence, is $247 billion, even greater than such companies as GE, Goldman Sachs and UBS Group, as well as countries like New Zealand, Algeria, Iraq and Romania.", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 29}

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nIn \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d the 1940s Christmas classic, George Bailey (played by Jimmy Stewart) is the guiding force of a small-town bank, who ends up sacrificing his own dreams for the betterment of his community. Ultimately, facing financial ruin, he begins to question what it was all for. That is when his friends appear, one by one, with a flurry of donations, reminding him of how he touched each and every one of their lives, and Bailey realizes he is a rich man after all. Bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos recently found himself at the center of a similar outpouring of gratitude. The author and public speaker has spent the last five years of his life traversing the globe and educating people about Bitcoin. But, as it turns out, he hadn\u2019t exactly made himself rich along the way. WIth the price of bitcoin soaring into the $16,000s, a grateful community has decided to give Antonopoulos\u2019s fortunes a karmic boost. A spontaneous giving spree, fueled by social media, is under way. Thus far, more than 100 BTC, valued at over $1.7 million has been sent to his bitcoin address. One individual alone sent an eye-popping 37 BTC, worth $500,000. (Update: That same individual added another 42 BTC, making for a total of 79 BTC: worth well over $1,000,000.)Along with the money, people are tweeting under the hashtag #ThankYouAndreas and reminding Antonopoulos of the many ways he made a difference in their lives. \u00a0\u201cWords are my craft but tonight I am speechless,\u201d the author of Mastering Bitcoin tweeted last night. Never a Rich ManAntonopoulos became involved with Bitcoin in 2012. He has written two books on the subject, describing in detail the technical rules governing Bitcoin in a way that a novice could understand, and has given more than 200 talks (many of them free) about Bitcoin.It is easy to imagine that someone who knows so much about Bitcoin might have found a way to profit from it. A small investment in the virtual currency five years ago, when bitcoin was at around $6, would have netted the Bitcoin writer a humongous profit. (Bitcoin is currently listed at $16,000.) But Antonopoulos wasn\u2019t really a speculator.Indeed, as investor Roger Ver pointed out in one of his tweets, if Antonopoulos had put more money into bitcoin early on, he would have been a lot better off financially.But Antonopoulos was too busy, too obsessed with spreading his vision of a world free from the strictures of legacy banks and payment systems. He wanted people to understand the technology and to appreciate its promise. That early obsession, as he described in a recent blog post, led him to undo a lifetime of savings and eventually fall into credit card debt as he tumbled down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. He lived paycheck to paycheck for years until becoming debt-free at the end of 2016. Those bitcoins he\u2019d collected and earned had to be cashed out along the way to support him and his family.\nI did invest, Roger. Then I sold in 2013 to pay my rent. I didn't have disposable income to work for two years without pay and invest at the same time. I should've gone into more debt, but that would have been irresponsible towards my family who I supported\u2014 Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop) December 5, 2017\n\n\n\nBecause most people were not aware of Antonopoulos\u2019s earlier struggles, some were puzzled when he recently began putting videos of his talks on Patreon, a membership platform that allows users to collect monthly subscription fees for services. \u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not a bitcoin millionnaire [sic],\u201d Antonopoulos responded to one follower on Twitter. \u201cMy supporters on Patreon, many at $5/month, make it possible for me to work with independence.\u201d\nDeveloper Adam Back quickly responded with the suggestion that \u201cif \u2018sign guy\u2019 can get a meaningful start from tips, we should try [to] find a way for the community to fund @aantonop to a hodlers position.\u201d And the community agreed. \nShortly thereafter, his number of Patreon supporters began to rise, and donations started to pour into Antonopoulos\u2019s bitcoin address.\nIn addition to the funds that accumulated, accolades began to pour in from supporters far and wide on Twitter, Reddit and Patreon. Many credit him for getting them into Bitcoin in the first place, for helping them to understand it and for inspiring them to pursue careers in the space.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone as authentic, well-intentioned and universally respected in the industry,\u201d wrote entrepreneur Ryan Selkis in a tweet. \n\n\n#THANKYOUANDREAS for being a shining example of what a thought leader in the space should look like \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\u2014 Dan Hedl (@danheld) December 6, 2017\n\n\n\n\u201c@aantonop is by far the BEST advocate and most eloquent speaker on #bitcoin.

He's spent years building products and solutions, all the while writing over 300 articles for various magazines covering software reviews, programming tips, interviews and music piracy.\nSafely storing cryptocurrency can be confusing, especially for newcomers to the space, but for people with visual impairments, finding an accessible option is especially challenging.IcyWallet is a cold wallet with a difference: it is designed to make it as simple as possible for people with visual impairments to manage offline bitcoin storage. The project got its start when Adam Newbold and his wife took a braille reading course as a learning activity. Shortly afterward, Newbold struck up a Reddit conversation with a blind Bitcoin enthusiast who expressed frustration with the lack of support for the blind community from Bitcoin software developers. None of the wallets worked correctly in his reader and he required help to perform any functions with bitcoin. \u201cI learned even more about practical accessibility issues and the real-world challenges that the blind encounter every day,\u201d Newbold told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThis turned into a stronger personal interest that merged with my existing interest in Bitcoin when I realized that there are pretty big opportunities for improving the state of accessibility in Bitcoin software.\u201dHe started a campaign in October 2017 to create a braille version of the original Bitcoin white paper. That campaign was successful and the document is now available for anyone wanting to get a copy. That first success led Newbold to create the IcyWallet. His goal is to provide a 100 percent free and open source bitcoin hardware wallet for the blind. Work is currently underway with early milestones achieved, the progress of which is tracked on their website.\u201cOne of the points you hear a lot about Bitcoin is that you can \u2018be your own bank,\u2019 which always sounds fun and empowering (and it is!),\u201d said Newbold. \u201cBut it also means that you need to take responsibility for all of the things that banks do, like keeping your funds secure.\u201dHe explained that even though today\u2019s technology has solved a substantial number of issues that people with disabilities face, when it comes to bitcoin and security, there are still several missing pieces. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any kind of hardware wallet on the market today that\u2019s fully accessible to people with blindness,\u201d said Newbold, \u201cand there are barriers to setting up secured, air-gapped solutions. This leaves people with blindness limited choices that all involve compromising security to some degree. With the IcyWallet, the private keys never leave the device.\u201d According to Newbold, here is how the device will work:First, the transaction is generated on a (different) computer connected to the internet, so that the fee can be properly estimated;Then, the transaction is signed by the IcyWallet device;Finally, the transaction is broadcasted to the Bitcoin network back on the internet-connected device. This keeps the IcyWallet device completely offline, ensuring that the private keys are safe at all times.Users simply plug in headphones and a keyboard or a refreshable braille display. The device boots directly into the wallet app with functional audio and braille support. \u201cRefreshable braille display support means that it will even support someone with deaf/blindness right out of the box,\u201d said Newbold.IcyWallet generates hierarchical deterministic wallets with mnemonic seeds for safe backup. The code is developed using the BitcoinJS library and is intended to be run on an \u201cair-gapped\u201d Raspberry Pi, though Newbold points out that, in theory, the software can run on other hardware.Newbold has plans to make a demo video/audio track available soon, as well as an early release of the software (probably limited to wallet generation only) so that he can start to get more feedback and code suggestions that will improve the IcyWallet.As Bitcoin in particular, and cryptocurrencies in general, see wider adoption, the implementation of greater accessibility systems will be important to their continued growth. IcyWallet is expected to launch at some point in 2018.", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 12}

In September 2017, the company announced that it was developing a blockchain for intellectual property protection and an in-game cryptocurrency .\u201cI\u2019ve been looking at blockchain technology since Second Life, as the Linden dollar was one of the first digital goods currencies,\u201d said Rosedale. \u201cAt the time that Bitcoin came out, I was thinking a lot about how we could generalize what we did at Second Life. I didn\u2019t have all of the ideas, but in the last few quarters we have been building the backend system to make all of this work.\u201dDifferent sorts of VR items, such as custom wearables for avatars (which were and still are very successful in the Second Life marketplace) will be sold and bought in Avatar Island through a new cryptocurrency running on a blockchain, which will also track the history and ownership of each item.\u201c[This] is the first beta release of the commerce system, which is a cryptocurrency-based content protection and payment system,\u201d said Rosedale in the High Fidelity forum. \u201c[Behind] \u00a0the scenes, the currency is actually stored on a \u2018blockchain\u2019 very similar to Bitcoin but supporting a higher transaction rate and lower fees. This blockchain also stores the PoP [Proof of Provenance] information for digital goods, meaning that both your currency and your digital property will exist in a public database and cannot be altered.\u201dContrary to Second Life, where the only option available to external operators was to host their VR worlds on servers operated by Second Life developer Linden Lab, High Fidelity allows developers to host VR worlds independently. In November 2017, High Fidelity released an update that allows developers to rapidly deploy High Fidelity VR domains to the cloud, in collaboration with DigitalOcean. The distributed nature of the upcoming High Fidelity VR network calls for full interoperability between different servers, including network-wide recognition of ownership rights.High Fidelity\u2019s Digital Asset Registry (DAR), is a decentralized, publicly auditable ledger that serves as a record of transactions made by High Fidelity users. Each item is uniquely identified with a digital fingerprint (a hash algorithm) and can be purchased using High Fidelity\u2019s blockchain-based cryptocurrency, the High Fidelity Coin (HFC). The DAR includes tamper-proof PoP services for any asset\u2019s chain of ownership, its characteristics and its entire history, from certification onward.This approach is designed to solve the theft and counterfeiting problems that plagued Second Life. At the apex of Rosedale\u2019s first VR world\u2019s popularity, thousands of independent developers around the world made a living designing and selling virtual items, and the need for more solid anti-piracy measures was widely felt.According to High Fidelity, the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains have limited throughput (transactions per second) and high transaction fees, which makes them unsuitable for HFC. Therefore, Rosedale\u2019s team opted for a new, public but \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchain. In a promotional video that predicts a booming future for the VR sector, with a billion users, 50 million servers and a trillion dollar economy, Rosedale explains the design and implementation criteria for High Fidelity\u2019s blockchain.\u201cAs of today, the blockchain is one node using the [Elements] codebase from Blockstream,\u201d said Rosedale. \u201cWe\u2019re going to federate it to a managed group of blocksigners and also provide a block explorer and a full read-only node as well, so that we have many backups of the blockchain. This is similar to the [DPoS] (Delegated Proof of Stake) model being used by [EOS] and others for upcoming public blockchains.\u201dFor now, the High Fidelity Commerce system is in closed beta, and High Fidelity is giving HFCs to anyone interested in participating in the beta. Eventually, HFC will be traded on public exchanges like other cryptocurrencies. \u201cIn the coming weeks and months, we will be attaching the HFC blockchain in several ways to the major cryptocurrency networks to enable you to freely trade HFC for other currencies like Bitcoin or Ether, or to use exchange markets to convert it back to real-world currency if you like,\u201d said Rosedale. Considering high price volatility as a roadblock, High Fidelity will try and stabilize the value of HFC at 100 HFC = $1 USD.Before getting too excited and rushing to buy HFC, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that Second Life never achieved mass-market appeal, and that could become the fate of High Fidelity as well. However, it can be argued that Second Life was launched too early, and modern VR interfaces, like the headsets and hand controllers developed by Facebook\u2019s Oculus VR, could be the game changer that will permit High Fidelity to succeed where Second Life failed. As always, time will tell.CrytekAnother VR game developer and technology provider, Crytek, is announcing a partnership with cryptocurrency startup Crycash to create a new cryptocurrency for gamers. Crytek is the maker of the high-performance game development platform CryEngine and publisher of many highly realistic VR games that are popular among hardcore gamers. \u201cThe Crycash ecosystem solves two problems at once: it gives gamers a way to monetize game time by completing in-game tasks, set by game developers, while providing developers with decentralized sales options for games and other virtual items,\u201d said Crycash CEO Wachtang Budagaschwili. \u201cCrycash will consist of four major components: Plink, a communications app for gamers and Crycash wallet; an advertising platform; an eSports platform for gaming tournaments and other events; and a virtual asset marketplace.\u201d\u201cWe see a lot of potential in the Crycash concept, and we were impressed by the Crycash team\u2019s innovative approach to creating practical products and tools for gamers,\u201d said Crytek Managing Director Faruk Yerli.Crycash will hold a token sale from December 12, 2017, to January 15, 2018, and add Crycash payment options to games from Crytek and other developers.", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 12}

He's spent years building products and solutions, all the while writing over 300 articles for various magazines covering software reviews, programming tips, interviews and music piracy.\nAmerican Bitcoin holders may soon have to report their holding to the United States government.First introduced on May 25, 2015, by Sen. Chuck Grassley [R-IA], Senate Bill S.1241, the \u201cCombating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017,\u201d can have serious implications for those involved in the cryptocurrency space. The hearing for S.1241 was held with virtually no public notice on November 28, 2017; the full two-hour hearing can be viewed here.Currently, the definition of \u201cfinancial institution\u201d includes banks, trust companies, credit unions, currency exchanges and the like. But according to\u00a0Section 5312(a) of title 31, the new bill would amend the definition of \u201cfinancial institution\u201d to include \u201can issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency.\u201d\u00a0This is most specifically embedded in Section 13: Sen. Dianne Feinstein [D-CA] said in her opening remarks of the hearing, \u201cThe bill criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account.\u201d Although, during the hearing, no further clarifications were given as to the effects this would have on the cryptocurrency community, based on the amended definition of \u201cfinancial institution,\u201d it would seem that the bill would criminalize anyone intentionally concealing ownership or control of a digital currency or exchange account. While there is no finalized bill yet, the implication would be that cryptocurrency holders need to fill in federal registration forms for tax disclosure, quarterly reporting and more.Notably, while the purpose of the bill and hearing had to do with adding digital currencies and exchanges to the definition of financial institutions, there was almost no discussion on the topic other than briefly in reference to drug cartels using them to launder money. For example, nowhere in the testimony by Coinbase board of directors member Kathryn Haun Rodriguez does she mention digital currencies or exchanges, and at no time was she asked any questions about them. Unsurprisingly, the bill is receiving pushback from some cryptocurrency holders. Activists on Reddit have started a social media campaign in opposition to the bill, and are suggesting others to tweet: \u201c@senjudiciary that #Bitcoiners are not #Crooks Remove #DigitalCurrencies from Section 13 of S1241.\u201d Others are contacting their senators directly.\n", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 8}

That could spell moon or doom for bitcoin, and everyone is speculating on what may happen next.\nIt is this Wall Street/BTC interaction (phenomenon) that may be driving the unbelievable price spike of the past few days \u2014 at least partially.\nOn the macro scale, however, we may be witnessing a more grand pattern forming; a price-correlated S-curve.\nThe S-curve is the classic adoption curve applied to the advent of new technologies. As a percentage of the population, adoption looks like a lag phase where the technology is utilized by the innovators of said technology, followed by an early adoption phase led by people who often take risks in order to be the first movers in a space. After the early adopter phase (~16% of the population is now participating), there comes a great \u201ctipping point\u201d where the wide use of the technology seems inevitable. The tipping point gives rise to the \u201cEarly Majority\u201d joining in on the fun, followed by the late majority and, finally, the holdouts who allow the top of the S to asymptotically approach total adoption. The curve, as a factor of time and adoption, looks sort of like the following:\n\nThis curve correlates nicely with adoption of some of the greatest technological innovations in our recent history:\n\nSome important things to note is that this is just U.S. adoption. Much of the world lagged behind the U.S. in the consumer appliance boom of the 1900s. All of these curves, however steep, do follow the same S-curve trend fairly nicely.\nSo what could that mean for bitcoin? It\u2019s difficult to choose a metric to define bitcoin adoption, and, in fact, there are disputes about if one metric accurately captures it. However, for simplicity I\u2019ll highlight Google searches for bitcoin and Coinbase user count as microcosms of the global adoption trend.\n\n(from CNBC)\nThis seems to show a very similar pattern to what could be the transitional phase between \u201cinnovators\u201d and \u201cEarly Adopters.\u201d Just to harken back to the earlier statement though \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to put a number on bitcoin adoption. \nSo why is this remarkable? Bitcoin may be the first \u201cbuyable\u201d S-curve. Because this is a capped-supply currency, more users adopting and using it necessitates an increase in price. Whether that correlation is even reflective of the current price action is a practically unanswerable question, and the obvious leaning would be towards there being a speculative additional value. However, with an increase in adoption, there seems to be a floor rising up to catch whatever \u201cbubble burst\u201d might occur, if and when it happens.\n\n\nI'm starting to take the controversial position that I'm less looking at a financial market chart and more looking at a graph for adoption rates. $BTC pic.twitter.com/RmGFyCdwan\u2014 Parabolic Trav (@parabolictrav) December 3, 2017\n\n\n\n\u201cEternal September\u201d is the phrase used to describe September of 1993, when widespread internet adoption began to look inevitable. It occured after AOL began a mailing campaign offering free trials of its internet service, leading to an influx of internet users that has since never ended. Hence \u201cEternal September.\u201d\n\n\nAlways thought it would take another bubble for the #crypto equivalent, but this might be the start of #Bitcoin Eternal September https://t.co/95PaF9ZYD7\u2014 David Bailey (@DavidFBailey) December 6, 2017\n\n\n\nTo compare bitcoin\u2019s adoption to its complement \u2014 the internet \u2014 this may very well be the \u201cEternal September\u201d episode for bitcoin.\nIf the S-curve adoption theory applies to bitcoin, then buckle up. I won\u2019t pretend to be able to predict a spot price, but I will say I think we may be sitting close to another order of magnitude this time next year.\nSee y\u2019all on the moon.\n\nCorollary: Bulls sound smart in bull markets. We may look back and laugh at this thought, or it may hold true for years to come. Time will tell. \u2018Til then, buy bitcoin.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Bitcoin futures were up over 20 percent leading into the U.S. market open. Current appetite for the futures contracts seems to show a stronger preference for near-term bitcoin futures priced above the current spot rate. According to the CBOE twitter feed, over 800 contracts were traded in the first two hours.Image source: CBOE delayed quotes dashboard as of 3:53 PM. ESTAt least one outage plagued the CBOE in early trading, including two minutes of downtime from 8:31 p.m. EST to 8:33 p.m. EST, while the CBOE stated at 11:34 p.m. EST that there would be a 5-minute hiatus if the front month (January expiration) rose above 30 percent.Image Source: www.cboe.comThese deliberate halts in trading are known as \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d and are meant to protect the market from unmanageable volatility. While we wait to see how futures trading unfolds in the U.S. markets today, here are some of the notable events that got us into a world of bitcoin futures.October 31The CME Group gave bitcoin investors around the world a bit of a Halloween treat when they announced plans to allow bitcoin futures to be traded on their exchange. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange\u2019s announcement notably coincided with the anniversary of the publication of Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakomoto\u2019s original 2008 white paper on the cryptocurrency.Cryptocurrency enthusiasts took this as a signal of mainstream acceptance of the asset class, and bitcoin closed the day (according to historical data provided by www.coinmarketcap.com) at $6,468.40. When futures trading opened last night, bitcoin was trading at $14,901.70.December 1, 2017Regulators gave bitcoin futures the green light for the CME Group as well as for self-certification by the CBOE Futures Exchange (CFE) as well as for the Cantor Exchange\u2019s new contract for bitcoin binary options. The exchanges assured the CFTC that the new products were compliant with the self-certification process rules, and the CFTC refrained from halting the self-certification. CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo stated in a press release: \u00a0Bitcoin, a virtual currency, is a commodity unlike any the Commission has dealt with in the past\u2026[a]s a result, we have had extensive discussions with the exchanges regarding the proposed contracts, and CME, CFE and Cantor have agreed to significant enhancements to protect customers and maintain orderly markets.December 4The CBOE announced it would launch futures trading in bitcoin under the symbol \u201cXBT\u201d on Sunday night, December 10, 2017, at 6 p.m. EST. This move was seen as a manoever to beat the earlier announcement from the competing CME that they would allow futures trading in bitcoin beginning December 18, 2017. Not surprisingly, the CBOE\u2019s usage of the exchange platform Gemini, owned by the Winklevoss twins, may allow the newly minted \u201cBitcoin Billionaires\u201d to further capitalize on the successes of the cryptocurrencies.December 5A Natixis Investment Managers Survey of 500 global investors managing more than $19 trillion of assets has found that \u201cnearly two-thirds [of survey participants] said Bitcoin was in a bubble, and this was a month before the cryptocurrency surged above $10,000 last week.\u201d Also bearish on bitcoin was Stephen Roach, a Yale University economist who told CNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Rundown\u201d that exchange legitimization makes bitcoin \u201csomewhat dangerous [for investors],\u201d citing a \u201clack of intrinsic underlying economic value to the concept.\u201dDecember 6S3 Partners, a data research and analytics firm, sent this note to investors on GBTC ETF, the only ETF which trades bitcoin. In the note, Managing Director of Predictive Analytics at S3, Ihor Dusaniwsky, suggested that bitcoin as an asset would be \u201cripe for a pullback once the CBOE futures contracts go live\u201d but also cautioned that the fees for shorting the GBTC ETF will be extremely high. While futures contracts would enable easier and safer access to both long and short positions, Dusaniwsky noted, futures trading would also carry premium costs for all GBTC ETF investors, stating:Long GBTC holders may feel the pain of its 53% asset premium shrinking, while short sellers will probably be incurring a 50%+ stock borrow fee \u2014 both sides will be paying a premium in order to ride the Bitcoin rollercoaster once the CBOE futures start trading.Also on December 6, 2017, trading volume for BTC nearly doubled from 6.9 billion to 12.7 billion and crosses the 10 billion volume threshold for the first time since Bitcoin crossed $10,000 (November 28, 2017). Whether this run up was related to the prospect of bitcoin futures or just normal market machinations is unclear.Screenshot of historical data from Coinmarketcap.com (link above)December 7The Futures Industry Association, an industry organization whose primary members consist of the largest clearing houses and clearing firms for futures in the world, published an open letter it had sent to the CFTC chairman on December 6, 2017, decrying the lack of \u201ca healthy dialogue between regulators, exchanges, clearing houses and the clearing firms who will be absorbing the risk of these volatile, emerging instruments during a default.\u201d This is in spite of the fact that the letter also admits that, \u201cUnder law, exchanges may self-certify a product for trading by the close of business one day and then list the product for trading the next day.This process does not require CFTC approval or input\u2026\u201d Also on December 7, in a joint interview with former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, stated that, \u201cWe\u2019ll [Goldman Sachs] see. If it works out and it gets more established and it trades like a store value and it doesn't move up and down 20% and there's liquidity in it, we\u2019ll get to it.\u201dThat same interview includes the suggestion that, according to an unnamed source with knowledge of Goldman Sachs plans, the investment bank plans to help clear bitcoin futures contracts for certain clients when the derivatives go live and that \u201cthe decision to clear client trades will be made on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Goldman Sachs \u201cwill act in an agency capacity\u201d and \u201cwon\u2019t serve as a market-maker or build inventory in the derivatives.\u201dDecember 8As the normal trading week came to an end, Coinbase and its exchange platform GDAX sent a reminder from Coinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, to its users via blog and email to \u201cinvest responsibly,\u201d also noting that \u201cthere may be downtime which can impact your ability to trade.\u201d While seemingly innocuous, it appears the Coinbase team was preparing for a surge in trading volume that would crash its platform. At 10 p.m. on December 10, 2017, Coinbase tweeted that it would be offline for one hour of scheduled maintenance to \u201chelp to prevent slow performance and login issues during larger traffic surges.\u201dConclusionThe market on Bitcoin Futures is open for business. After 14 hours of premarket bitcoin futures and a full day of trading from both European and U.S. investors, \u201cXBT\u201d seems to be functioning as planned. While spectators of the past week have foretold of everything from rosy outlooks to apocryphal warnings, we, at least for the moment, seem to be on a path toward embracing cryptocurrency futures as a new wave of derivatives.", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 11}

In view of the group\u2019s size and financial muscle, this initiative is likely to boost the mainstream adoption of the practice of paying salaries in cryptocurrencies.The move is partly motivated by the desire to promote the adoption of Bitcoin, which is a strategic priority for GMO. In fact, the group is vigorously active in bitcoin trading and mining services, as well as mining hardware development. Therefore, anything that is good for Bitcoin is also good for GMO.In May 2017, GMO launched a cryptocurrency exchange, initially dubbed Z.com Coin and later rebranded as GMO Coin, which features cryptocurrency FX and trading on both computers and smartphones. The exchange offers two types of services: cryptocurrency FX, which is an over-the-counter (OTC) bitcoin margin trading and cryptocurrency trading, which enables buying and selling of virtual currency in JPY in addition to basic features allowing customers to send and receive bitcoins.In September 2017, GMO announced the upcoming launch of a new bitcoin mining business. \u201cWe will operate a next-generation mining center utilizing renewable energy and cutting-edge semiconductor chips in Northern Europe,\u201d GMO stated, emphasizing that they will invest in R&D and manufacturing of hardware including the next-generation mining chip. \u201cWe will use cutting-edge 7 nm process technology for chips to be used in the mining process, and jointly work on its research and development and manufacturing with our alliance partner having semiconductor design technology.\u201d The mining business is scheduled to start in January 2018. GMO expressed its belief that cryptocurrencies will develop into \u201cnew universal currencies\u201d available to anyone from any country or region who wants to freely exchange value, \u201ccreating a new borderless economic zone.\u201dThe option to receive part of the salary in bitcoin will initially only be available to employees of one GMO company \u2014 GMO Internet Co. Ltd. \u2014 starting in March 2018, but it will be gradually extended to more than 4,000 employees in other GMO companies based in Japan.The minimum bitcoin payment will initially be 10,000 yen (~$88) and the upper limit will be 100,000 yen (~$881). Each salary payment in yen will be reduced by the amount of bitcoin paid, using the exchange rate at the GMO Coin exchange.Mainichi Japan notes that Japan's labor code stipulates that businesses must pay employees in a recognized currency such as the yen, but, according to GMO, the move is in accordance with the law because any payments in bitcoin would be consensual, with a chosen amount to be deducted from paychecks and put toward purchasing bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is rising in popularity in Japan with an increasing number of retailers accepting it as a form of payment.GMO Internet Group wants to contribute to the development of cryptocurrencies in the world by promoting cryptocurrency-related initiatives throughout the group. In particular, GMO wants to promote ownership of bitcoin among its employees \u2014 who can be the best evangelists for the group\u2019s products and services related to the digital currency \u2014 to improve the employees\u2019 exposure to and understanding of Bitcoin.\u201cEmployers can now pay employees a portion of their net earnings in bitcoin by collaborating with niche payroll solution providers such as Bitwage, Wagepoint, or Bitpay, who manage the back-end mechanics, eliminate exposure to price volatility, and reduce compliance and governance risks,\u201d noted Deloitte principal Eric Piscini.A recent overview of cryptocurrency payroll processors and early adopting clients notes that offering salaries in bitcoin could make it easier for companies to retain and attract talent. Besides compensating current employees, \u201c[cryptocurrencies] could help businesses more effectively tap into the open talent economy, where individual contributors may be drawn to business partners that offer payout features only cryptocurrency makes possible: fast peer-to-peer payments across country borders with minimal friction (or total freedom) from traditional banking systems,\u201d said Piscini.For now, the GMO press release is available only in Japanese.", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 14}

Now, trying to tame the wave of wild cryptocurrency speculation in the country, South Korea is imposing trade bans for minors and looking for ways to impose taxes on investment returns.South Korea is the world\u2019s third largest market in bitcoin trading, after Japan and the U.S., and the largest exchange market for ether, accounting for more than 33 percent of its market share, according to a recent MIT Technology Review report. The country is also home to two of the top 15 global digital-currency exchanges (Bithumb and Coinone) and believed to have about one million registered daily traders in virtual currencies, which is equivalent to about one out of every 50 citizens.This is worrying the South Korean government. In September 2017, the country\u2019s Financial Services Commission (FSC) ordered a ban on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). In November 2017, the head of South Korea\u2019s Financial Supervisory Service said that the agency was monitoring cryptocurrency trading inside the country, and the country\u2019s National Tax Agency revealed that it was considering a value-added tax, a capital gains tax or both on cryptocurrency trades. If the plan is implemented, South Korea will become one of the few countries to tax cryptocurrency-to-cash exchanges.The government\u2019s concern is also motivated by the risk of cyberattacks from the country\u2019s rogue neighbor, North Korea. According to South Korea\u2019s National Police Agency, North Korean hackers could be targeting South Korean bitcoin exchanges. With these newest measures, North Korean banks that offer accounts for cryptocurrency trading will have to verify the identification of new account holders and prohibit minors from opening accounts. Woori Bank and Korea Development Bank will shut down virtual accounts offered to cryptocurrency exchanges before year-end, according to the banks.The regulators will also bar financial institutions from investing in or obtaining cryptocurrencies, and is considering ways to oblige cryptocurrency exchange operators to verify users\u2019 real names, strengthen storage security of encryption keys, and disclose purchase price and order volumes. The authorities will also take strong-handed punitive actions against the perpetrators of cryptocurrency-related scams. In a press release, the government said that the new regulations were necessary \u201cto prevent a general public without expertise from suffering losses by participating in virtual currency investments that have massive fluctuations.\u201dThese issues were discussed on Wednesday, December 13, 2017, in a meeting presided over by Hong Nam-ki, minister of the Office for Government Policy coordination, and attended by officials from the ministries of justice, finance, and science and ICT, as well as from the Financial Services Commission, the Korea Communications Commission, the Fair Trade Commission and the National Tax Service. While some news headlines are presenting this as a catastrophic development that will shut down the cryptocurrency industry in South Korea, the initiative of the South Korean authorities is in line with current trends toward stronger cryptocurrency regulations in China, Europe and the U.S. \u201cA right set of regulations will rather nurture the (virtual currency) market, and we would welcome that,\u201d Bithumb representatives told Reuters, adding that such a code of conduct could add legitimacy to the market.", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 14}

They\u2019ve sold to pay bills and expenses.\u201dIndeed, last week it was revealed that Bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos was one of those who had not been in a position to hold his early coins long enough to reap the rewards. In a subsequent outpouring of appreciation, Bitcoin enthusiasts sent him donations of more than 100 BTC, equivalent to more than $1.7 million. In this same spirit of giving back, Pine is sharing their own newfound wealth.\u201cSometime around the early days of bitcoin, I saw the promise of decentralized money and decided to mine/buy/trade some magical internet tokens,\u201d states the Pineapple Fund website. \u201cThe expectation shattering returns of bitcoin over many years has [led] to an amount far more than I can spend. What do you do when you have more money than you can ever possibly spend? Donating most of it to charity is what I\u2019m doing.\u201dSome charities that are already receiving donations from the Pineapple Fund include Watsi, The Water Project, EFF, MAPS, SENS Research Foundation, charity: water ($1 million each), BitGive ($500,000) and OpenBSD ($50,000).\nHave you heard?! Yes, it's TRUE! We received an extremely generous donation of $500K from the Pineapple Fund!! HUGE THANKS!! Pineapple Fund has announced the most significant #philanthropic gesture EVER in #bitcoin to donate over 5,000 BTC! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/fRL8NL3YzI\u2014 BitGive\u00ae (@BitGiveOrg) December 14, 2017\n\n\n\n\nPine has a long history in the cryptocurrency world and started out mining on an old home PC. \u201cI discovered bitcoin back when it was a small community of people trying to turn a toy project into a new decentralized monetary paradigm,\u201d they told Bitcoin Magazine. \n\u201cIt\u2019s shorter to list the things I haven\u2019t done in the cryptocurrency space. I\u2019ve even created my own cryptocurrency; however, I can\u2019t name it.\u201d\nThe Pineapple Fund is planning to work with a nonprofit to help administer the fund. In spite of recent trends toward various forms of decentralized, crowdsourced decision-making, that\u2019s not in the plans. \u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re not huge fans of the crowdsourcing approach,\u201d explained Pine. \u201cIt does not solve a problem we\u2019re facing now, and there would be many challenges we\u2019d have to solve with crowdsourcing decision making.\u201d\nPine is convinced that what the world needs is peace, love, unity and respect. They listed medical research, mental health, wildlife and environmental conservation, fighting domestic violence and sexual abuse, sustaining basic necessities, and technology-related causes (advocacy and open-source projects) as main areas of focus.\n\u201cWhy these? Well, it\u2019s not that I think they are the most important or have the highest impact, because I think everyone has a different set of values,\u201d explained Pine. \u201cThey align with my values, and I think any contribution to those causes will bring some good to this world we all share.\u201d\nPine said they won\u2019t become actively involved in the charities and projects they support: \u201cAs much as I would like to, I have other ventures that I\u2019m busy with,\u201d they said.\nWill Pine ever share their real identity? That\u2019s unlikely. \u201cI prefer keeping my identity a mystery. The Pineapple Project isn\u2019t about publicity. In fact, zero people in my life know that I'm behind it. It\u2019s better for people to think you are well off than super rich.\n\u201cBut I can share my love for pineapple,\u201d they added. \u201cI once ate so much pineapple that I suffered an allergic reaction and had to go to urgent care!

He's spent years building products and solutions, all the while writing over 300 articles for various magazines covering software reviews, programming tips, interviews and music piracy.\nA new project called UnitedBitcoin (warning: the site autoplays audio) promises to add smart contract features using the UTXO model, support for the lightning network and SegWit, and eight-megabyte blocks. Headed up by Jeff Garzik, the lead developer behind the failed SegWit2x hard fork, along with Matthew Roszak and SongXiu Hua, this UnitedBitcoin (UB) hard fork will offer replay protection to prevent people from accidentally spending their coins on both the Bitcoin and the UnitedBitcoin blockchains.Garzik told Bitcoin Magazine that \u201c10% of the total worldwide SHA-256 hash power\u201d has moved to the new UB network, with much of the support coming from China and older mining equipment that was no longer profitable due to the escalating difficulty in mining bitcoin. He noted that UB is already supported on the ZB and EXX exchanges.The UB white paper outlines how lost bitcoins have created deflationary pressure that has pushed the price up. Because those bitcoins are out of circulation, the supply is further decreased. One of the issues that UB seeks to address is to find a purpose both for those lost bitcoins and for \u201cinactive\u201d wallets by creating a stable cryptocurrency linked to their addresses. All active Bitcoin addresses will receive the same balance on the UB chain, much like previous forks. The balances of UB on inactive addresses, however, will be confiscated by the UB Foundation and used to \u201cserve the community.\u201d Inactive addresses are defined in the white paper as \u201caddresses without activity since block height #494000 (November 11, 2017) and as a result didn\u2019t automatically receive UBTC during phase 1 of the asset allocation procedure.\u201dUB does not distinguish between an \u201cinactive\u201d address and one which is simply being used by a long-time \"hodler.\"\u201cThere is no difference. An inactive account is an inactive account,\u201d said Garzik. \u201cLike during [the] Ethereum new coin creation, you had to take a proactive step, otherwise you got zero [ether]. This is normal for new token creation \u2014 new chain, new ERC20, but different from all other Bitcoin Forks. We are trying to do something new and different.\u201dAnyone with a prior balance of 0.01 BTC in an \u201cinactive\u201d address at the time of the November 11 fork can still get UB tokens, so long as they are willing to take such a \u201cproactive step\u201d: that is, they make at least one transfer to their own Bitcoin address between Block 498,777 and Block 501,878 (December 12, 2017, to 12:00 GMT on January 3, 2018). Only the original address can make the transfer to itself, and the receiving address must be used as one of the sending (input) addresses.One privacy issue to consider is that in order to \u201cproactively\u201d claim BU tokens, the protocol forces users to reuse their Bitcoin addresses; this action puts privacy at risk and, unless it is done carefully, may link many of the users\u2019 coins together.\nIt's a gold mine for blockchain deanonymization, merging up UTXOs and reusing addresses. Can't help but think such an artificial qualification is deliberate.\u2014 Johnathan Corgan (@jmcorgan) December 13, 2017\n\n\n\n\nUser privacy protection is not the only part of the protocol that is drawing criticism, however.\n\u201cThe code contains a god mode; it\u2019s literally called that,\u201d Blockchain developer Sjors Provoost said to Bitcoin Magazine. He said that it appears as if this \u201cgod mode\u201d will create a multisignature address that belongs to a (yet-to-be-defined) UnitedBitcoin Foundation.\n\u201cUnlike previous airdrops, the initial coin distribution is not determined by a consensus rule,\u201d he added. \u201cThis means that even if you were to run the full UB node software (which you should not), you will have no way of knowing for sure how many coins you get. Conversely, if you already had bitcoin, you won\u2019t know how many of \u2018your\u2019 coins will be confiscated. You simply have to trust their promise to take and redistribute coins as their marketing promises.\u201d\nAccording to Provoost, the new consensus rule allows the owner of this foundation address to spend any UTXO they want. \u201cThese confiscations will be included in holy blocks, which can be created during the first 500 blocks after the fork. This is how they implement the redistribution as I just described, but they can do much more.\u201d \nFurthermore, Provoost is concerned about the quality of the code itself. \u201cGarzik\u2019s previous project SegWit2x tried to keep its changes relative to Core to a bare minimum. Although at the time of the planned fork their code base was about a year behind Bitcoin Core, it didn\u2019t introduce many changes,\u201d he pointed out. \n\u201cUnitedBitcoin on the other hand has introduced far more changes, making the task of tracking Bitcoin Core far more difficult. It\u2019s not as many changes as Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Cash, and the problem is somewhat mitigated by them sunsetting the more complicated consensus changes like god mode. However, even the small change in SegWit2x had a widely publicized serious bug in it and there are rumors of more.\u201d\nWhat Happens to Those \u201cReclaimed\u201d Tokens?\nGarzik has plans to \u201cbuild a better Tether\u201d by using the UB reserve, funded by coins reclaimed from \u201cinactive\u201d addresses. According to the project, 70 percent of confiscated UB coins will be held as collateral to issue stable tokens pegged to a fiat currency. \n\u201cThe UB reserve can be used as a backing asset for a stable, non-volatile currency,\u201d said Garzik. \u201cThis is auditable and transparent and on the blockchain. It will be over-collateralized, 200\u2013300% to maintain the stability even in the face of a volatile price of the reserve.\u201d\nThe remaining 30 percent of the confiscated coins will support another new feature: owners of QTUM, H-shares and ether will receive a share of the remaining redistributed UB. \u00a0\nUB is experimenting with a new model: engage multiple communities \u2014 ETH, Qtum \u2014 rather than following the tired model of rewarding Bitcoin maximalists with a coin they dislike and will just dump on day 1.\nAccording to Garzik, the specific claim process for the redistribution of UB has yet to be determined. \u201cThe UB board is still being put in place \u2014 things are moving very fast \u2014 and this will include more specifics on governance and community allocations.\u201d\nThe scheduled timeline of what has been released and what is coming breaks down as follows:\nDecember 12, 2017: \nFork of Bitcoin to UnitedBitcoin (at block height #498,777) with support for:\nIncreased block size to 8 MBSegWit supportReplay ProtectionAsset Allocation\nJanuary 3, 2018:\nEnd of Asset Allocation phase #2Pegged currency based on color currency\nFebruary 28, 2018:\nLaunch of smart contract support\nApril 28, 2018:\nLaunch of lightning network support\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 14}

In the last 30 days, the price of bitcoin has doubled \u2014 entering into what most traditional market analysts would deem \u201cbubble territory.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s growth has been so rapid, it has managed to break north out of a parabolic trend to form an even more aggressive parabolic shape known as a \u201chypodermic trend.\u201d Let\u2019s take a look at the macro view of bitcoin and see if this trend is sustainable or ripe for a correction:Figure 1: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro TrendThe image above shows a multi-year, parabolic envelope that, until recently, has guided the bitcoin bull market. Within the parabolic envelope we see a strong linear channel (shown in purple) that has provided very strong support and resistance through much of the bitcoin price growth. At the end of November 2017, however, bitcoin price growth was so strong, it managed to break out of both the linear and parabolic trends and form a more aggressive price trend: a hypodermic trend.Figure 2: BTC-USD, 60-Minute Candles, Hypodermic TrendlineThe solid red line represents an aggressive support line that has guided this new, aggressive price growth out of the parabolic envelope. As of the time of this article, I am monitoring a trading range very closely as it nears this hypodermic trend. A breakdown below this hypodermic trend represents a diminished trend of demand in the bitcoin market, and it could ultimately lead to a local top on for BTC-USD. Paired with this hypodermic breakdown is a breakdown of the trading range (shown in blue) that has a span of approximately $5,000. A breakdown of a trading range that large would have quite a meaningful market reaction and is likely to see a profound correction before bitcoin buyers step back in.However, before we get all doomsday-esque, it\u2019s important to remember that distribution phases and reaccumulation phases are quite similar in shape and are called \u201cevil twins\u201d of one another. It\u2019s entirely possible we could see new all-time highs out of bitcoin but, given the weak and anemic follow-through of each all-time high breaching the trading range, I am inclined to lean less toward accumulation and more toward distribution. As always, volume will be a huge indicator in this process; a great telltale that we are, in fact, in an accumulation phase will be volume growth coupled with price growth. If we begin to push new highs and we see a volume growth trend combined with it, there will be a great sigh of relief from traders as this pairing will indicate increasing demand and diminishing free-floating supply in the market.Summary:The price of bitcoin has doubled in the last month.The price growth has been so aggressive that it has broken north of a parabolic trend it\u2019s been well-confined within for 3 years.Bitcoin is at a crucial point as it currently decides whether it wants to move up or down in price.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

He says that \u201cat least eight cryptocurrency-related stocks are now trading in Canada.\u201dHashChain stock started trading today at $2.20 CDN a share. The company has already raised $4.4 million with 41,179,000 common shares both issued and outstanding, in preparation for today\u2019s launch on the TSX.HashChain says it will initially mine the altcoin Dash but will go on to mine bitcoin in January 2018. After that they say they will \u201cbe supporting highly scalable and flexible operations across all major cryptocurrencies.\u201d The company is counting on their Canadian location to give them an edge:\u201cOur ideal location for mining will maximize revenue on each coin, and our proprietary approach to operations can sustain rapid growth and scalability.\u201dHashChain CEO Patrick Gray told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview that although their office is in New York, mining operations will be run out of Vancouver, Canada.\u201cWe have our mining operation in Vancouver because it's the optimal location to reduce the costs of large-scale mining. Canada has cheap internet, low energy costs and a cold climate that greatly reduces the cost of cooling mining equipment,\u201d noted Gray.\u201cWe monitor these operations 24/7 from New York with a web interface that ensures IP, temperature, hashrate, wattage, fans and memory are all operating at maximum efficiency. This allows us to minimize expenses for each coin mined.\u201dHashCoin Hopes to Benefit from Canadian Energy EfficiencyAs a start, HashChain is mining on the Ethereum blockchain using high-performance ASIC 100 Dash mining rigs. It has also purchased 770 ASIC bitcoin rigs.\u201cOne of HashChain's core advantages is that our operations are in Canada, which is one of a few places globally that offers the most energy-efficient mining conditions,\u201d said Gray. \u201cOn top of that, there is likely to be new rigs on the market in the near future that reduce the amount of energy required to mine at high hashrates, similar to how the market largely moved from GPUs to ASICs for this reason. From a general standpoint, as the country begins to move towards renewable energy, this could lessen the environmental impact as well.\u201dHashChain hopes to set up more mining locations in cool climates, with low-cost energy and reliable high-speed internet, what the company calls the \u201ctrifecta\u201d most critical to mining success. They are also currently working on proprietary software capable of monitoring hash rates of equipment so they will automatically switch computing power to the currency that is most profitable at that time.", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 18}

Heated disputes over scaling that have become toxic in the ecosystem have overshadowed the technology. The cancelation of SegWit2x, the most controversial proposal in this cryptocurrency\u2019s history, averted a potential catastrophe. Innovation moves on and the community is finding some time for reflection. What did this latest crisis teach us? The political battle that came to the forefront in the last several months challenges all to examine a prevailing notion of Bitcoin as apolitical money and can help us explore the deeper vision behind this technology.The trilogy of Wachowski\u2019s science fiction film became a popular meme in the Bitcoin battle on social media. The Matrix is a story of a computer programmer played by Keanu Reeves who is said to become the One who can free people from a machine-controlled system. Neo\u2019s struggle to liberate humanity from oppression seems to have resonated with many Bitcoiners who found a similar passion in the potential of Bitcoin to bring financial sovereignty to the common man in the world of central banks.In The Matrix Reloaded, Neo confronts the man who designed the system. The Architect, who represents scientific reason and logic, tells Neo:\u201cYour life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision \u2026\u201dTo this, Neo responds saying, \u201cChoice. The problem is choice.\u201d Neo\u2019s choice represents an irregularity that disrupts order and eventually threatens the system. This irregularity, in the eyes of the Architect, is a kind of bug that needs to be removed, yet he is unable to do so.Bitcoin is an architecture that contains this anomaly. If we look back at the past nine years of its existence, the development of this network relied on the individual\u2019s choice. In the white paper published in the midst of a financial crisis, the mysterious author put forward a blueprint of a decentralized network and set up its basic design. What created the network was participation of people who, of their own volition, followed the white rabbit. Yet at the same time as the network grew, this uncontrollable anomaly began to bring hostile forces to the network and create fluctuations in equations.Clash of Two VisionsFrom Bitcoin XT to Bitcoin Classic to Bitcoin Unlimited, the proposals to change Bitcoin\u2019s consensus emerged over time, which stirred up disagreements. The crux of the conflict can be found in opposing visions of Bitcoin. One camp views it as a payment system, wanting cheaper, faster on-chain transactions, while the other sees censorship resistance and permissionlessness as its defining feature and value proposition.The friction of these two visions can be metaphorically depicted as a battle between Agent Smith and Neo involving their different ideas of freedom. Agent Smith represents the Adam Smith of the world, advocating a \u201cfree market\u201d economy born in the Industrial Revolution. On the other hand, Neo is a symbol of civil liberty in the Digital Age, representing free speech and privacy enabled by asymmetric encryption. The growing schism between two visions of Bitcoin seemed to have reached the point of no return in May with the announcement of the \u201cBitcoin Scaling Agreement.\u201dSegWit2x, or the New York Agreement, was born in the heat of the scaling dispute. This proposal was put forward by opponents of the Core development team\u2019s proposed protocol upgrade (a way to increase a new capacity without having to change consensus rules, while fixing a long-standing malleability bug). Most signers of the agreement saw SegWit2x as a compromise between Core\u2019s planned SegWit implementation (BIP141) and Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s threat of a contentious hard fork alternative. They saw it as a way to keep the network together.SegWit2x, a plan to double the block size through a hard fork, was developed in an invite-only meeting in a New York hotel by major actors in the industry. Unlike Bitcoin Cash, which was launched by supporters of a block size increase in response to the SegWit lock-in, SegWit2x lacked the replay protection needed to prevent potential loss of users\u2019 funds through accidental replay spending and replay attacks. Concerns were raised about this proposal, specifically its rushed preparation done in a closed development process. Some perceived it as a dangerous and reckless hard fork, which is not a software upgrade as proponents claim, but an attack on Bitcoin.Beginning of ResistanceIn the Matrix series, aside from the Architect, who presents himself as the father of the system, there is another crucial character: the Oracle, who is the mother of the system. Morpheus speaks of how the Oracle, who made a prophecy, has been with the common people since the beginning of the resistance. He tells Neo just before he mets the Oracle, \u201cTry not to think of it in terms of right and wrong. She is a guide. She can help you find the path.\u201dIn a sense, the creator of Bitcoin was like a prophet who set up a path for a new future for others to find. What is contained in the white paper is a vision that has set everything in motion: a vision that existed from the very beginning. Before the architecture of 1s and 0s, whether numbers were used to calculate profit margins or to program software, there was a vision to guide human action.The rabbit hole that took many of us to the Wonderland of this crypto-world goes much deeper. In a speech in Zurich titled \u201cCall for a Revolutionary Hacker Movement,\u201d Amir Taaki, who was one of the first developers to start working on Bitcoin, described the battle that has long been engaged since the dawn of the internet. He reminded the audience how Bitcoin is a political movement that was built on an earlier struggle.Taaki spoke about another prophet who inspired him to engage in Bitcoin development. His name is Richard Stallman, the founder of the free software movement, who brought about the idea of free software. This godfather of the GNU/Linux operating system described free software as \u201cthe first battle of liberation of cyberspace.\u201d Stallman explained that free software is \u201ccontrolled by its users, rather than the reverse.\u201d He defined \u201cfree\u201d as freedom, libre in French, and not in terms of price. This vision of technology to empower individuals and change the world formed hacker ethics, which inspired a group known as the cypherpunks, an electric mailing list of activists who advocate free speech and privacy with the use of strong cryptography.Amir noted how commercial interests co-opted Stallman\u2019s vision by renaming free software as \u201copen source\u201d and rebranding it with an open-market idea focused on efficiency, profit and growth. Networks of committed individuals, who out of their own free resolution dedicated themselves to shared ideals greater than themselves, were slowly overtaken by business interests and people who were overly driven by self-interests. He then pointed out how the debacle of the block size debate was a hijacking of Bitcoin\u2019s original vision, rooted in these ethics.Resurgence of Free Software Bitcoin is a breakthrough of computer science as free software, which ensures individual users\u2019 rights to control its program. The first essential condition of freedom in the principle of free software that Stallman articulated is \u201cfreedom to run the program as you wish.\u201d Stallman explained that if you are not a programmer and don\u2019t know how to program, you can pay someone to do it for you and then, through them, you can exercise your freedom.Bitcoin is a global project of free software, in which changes to the protocol are made through a broad consensus of the network. What maintains the integrity of this collective free software are full nodes run by individual users who enforce Bitcoin consensus rules, often referred to as the economic majority. By running codes of their own choice and using the nodes to receive transactions, users create economic activity. This way, they can support the developers who work on their behalf.The proposed large block size violates this first premise of freedom, for it would increase the cost for individual users to run full nodes, making it impossible for them to use the free-market forces to exercise their own freedom. Thus, this idea for a bigger block size was rejected on technical grounds, with consideration of the security trade-off that centralization brings. A new solution has been put forward by core developers to preserve this essential condition of freedom on the first layer, with specialization to be built into other layers.Responding to the SegWit2x initiative, CEO and co-founder of Prasos, Henry Brade, noted, \u201cWe are seeing the removal of #Bitcoin cypherpunk roots and the insertion of an industrial oligopoly to control all Bitcoin development.\u201d Some articulated how the real story behind this scaling drama is all about control and noted how these were efforts partially driven by the desire to remove the influence of Bitcoin Core contributors and lock down development within their own vested interests.Hash Power SupremacyLike Agent Smith, who tried to keep Neo under his control, the world of IOU with laissez-faire economics collides with cypherpunks\u2019 hacker ethics of free and open software. With ICOs and new BIPs filled with empty promises, corporate and Wall Street profiteers disguised as prophets try to infiltrate the cryptosphere.Big business players, like wild cowboys, plunder knowledge in the Bitcoin source code repository that is carefully maintained through rigorous testing and peer review. Under the banner of \u201copen source,\u201d those driven by greed and commercial interests try to copy, modify and create their own versions of this currency and put the whole network under their proprietary control.Here, the industrial infrastructure of power came in full force to resist the ascent of a new Digital Era. Ideology of hash power supremacy was taken up by SegWit2x proponents, who argued that miners can decide or should dictate the future of the Bitcoin protocol. This ideology is based on the belief (perhaps held by some out of lack of knowledge and by others more intentionally) that a blockchain with more hashing power dedicated to it becomes Bitcoin. Some criticized these miners\u2019 attitudes to put themselves above the protocol rules enforced by users. They saw it as a dangerous, slippery slope toward changing all other rules, including the 21 million coin limit.The community\u2019s concern about this seemingly overarching power of miners reached another level last spring when the controversy over Bitmain\u2019s AsicBoost technology emerged. The allegation was made that Chinese hardware maker Bitmain was secretly exploiting a previously known weakness in Bitcoin\u2019s algorithm and engaging in unfair mining practices. If this was true, it was like a malicious malware in software that was released into the network. Monopoly through a patent on mining chip technology can be used as a weapon to disable fair market competition and restrict users\u2019 access to participate in the network fully.#UASF, Proof-of-Hats ConsensusWhile proponents of SegWit2x tried to command economically rational miners and intensify the threat of a hard fork, resistance had emerged. The attempted hashing power takeover was met by Twitter hashtag activism. Around this consensus algorithm, a human network of solidarity was quickly formed, and a spontaneous, self-directing organism emerged within the ecosystem.A seed of this movement was planted when pseudonymous Bitcoin and Litecoin developer Shaolinfry proposed his User Activated Soft Forks (UASF). The vision of UASF is said to be inspired by game theory put forward by the author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, namely a concept of the \u201cintolerant minority.\u201d This idea of an activation mechanism enforced by users began to grow when it kindled in the spirit of others. Samson Mow, the CSO of the blockchain technology company Blockstream, set up a bounty to fund the development of a UASF software implementation designed to trigger BIP141.The UASF cap distributed by Mow became a Proof-of-Hat consensus, a torch of freedom that unites those whose hearts beat to keep the original vision of Bitcoin immutable. Linux software engineer Warren Togami reminded Bitcoiners that users are in charge: \u201cStop begging developers to decide. Users have the real power, and they need to step up their advocacy game. #BIP148.\u201d The previously silenced majority had found an avenue to exercise their own power.#NO2X, the Rise of Hashtag ActivismWith his gift for social engineering, Mow created Twitter moments. Titled \u201cBitcoin vs. CorporateBitcoin (corporate takeover),\u201d his \u201cmoment\u201d called on users to rise up in this \u201cbattle for Bitcoin\u2019s soul.\u201d Dubbed as Bitcoin Independence Day, activation for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 (BIP148) was set for August 1. In an interview with Fortune magazine, Mow pointed out the contingency of individuals who are pushing for a hard fork and driven by an agenda to bring Bitcoin onto a path of centralization. Their irreconcilable differences were manifested right in the code of BIP148, with its different activation method being incompatible with SegWit2x. Facing the challenge of a potential coin-split between two implementations, another individual rose to the occasion.James Hilliard, Bitmain Warranty engineer (not to be confused with Bitmain), created BIP91, a largely miner-enforced soft fork that could keep the Bitcoin network together. Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo helped a smooth rollout by making updates to FIBRE, the fast block-replaying network, and alerted miners to make sure their BIP-enforcing nodes had connections. With these collaborations, BIP91 gained rapid signals from the mining community and was locked in 10 days before BIP148\u2019s flag day for activation.\nbitcoin right now. pic.twitter.com/Z2rKZAksdL\u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) July 20, 2017\n\n\n\n\nThe threshold momentum leading up to the SegWit lock-in and its activation attracted the attention of the entire global network to the blockchain. Rodolfo Novak, the CEO and founder of Coinkite, a Bitcoin web wallet system, tweeted in countdown for lock-in: \u201c#SegWit is now locked-in! Thanks to #UASF #BIP148. Never forget who governs #Bitcoin, no one, but everyone.\u201d\nExuberance created through BIP148 mobilization fueled a #NO2X protest movement. Strong support came from the Bitcoin community. Mir Serena Liponi, an organizer of the Milan Meetup and chief expert officer at BlockchainLab.it, announced the joint NO2X statement from the Italian Bitcoin community. On the first week of the month that this hard fork was planned to be activated, smart contract pioneer Nick Szabo went public with his opposition, adding the NO2X label to his Twitter profile. As a result of community reactions such as these, SegWit2x was called off. The announcement of the suspension was made, citing a lack of sufficient consensus.\nMichael Goldstein, founder and president of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, tweeted, \u201cBetween #UASF and #No2x, I have to completely rethink my former disregard for hashtag activism,\u201d to which Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd responded, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like virtual activism is good enough for a virtual currency...\u201d\nHuman Faces Behind Technology\nWhat did this hashtag battle reveal? The disruption in cyberspace shook off the image of Bitcoin as apolitical money, which is often associated with cold algorithms and rational and impartial scientists. It has shown this community the role of human efforts in the development of this incredibly disruptive invention and how there are motives other than economic incentives. We have seen the faces of individuals on both sides who are deeply committed to their own vision of Bitcoin.\nMiners no longer represent cold power plants and the roles of machines equipped with efficient computing chips. Co-founder and CEO of Bitmain, Jihan Wu, came to gain wide recognition with his sensational tweet; \u201cF\u2014k your mother if you want f\u2014k.\u201d Marek \u201cSlush\u201d Palatinus, founder of the world\u2019s first Bitcoin mining pool, came out to announce that @slush_pool, responsible for ~4 percent of the global hashrate, was dedicated to signaling for BIP91. Behind the scenes, there are real people with their own values and ideas.\nPolitical passion ignited the crypto space. One of the most well-known angel investors and Bitcoin evangelists, Roger Ver, showed his fierce will to unite his libertarian ideas and market forces in his new brand, Bitcoin Cash. Rick Falkvinge, IT entrepreneur and the founder of Pirate Party, distributed his wisdom of Swarmwise to guide a leaderless network.\nBitcoin Core contributors like Eric Lombrozo and Luke Dashjr have played key roles in forming the idea of deploying SegWit as a soft fork in 2015. These developers translated their knowledge into action by voicing their support for UASF and assisting the process. Pieter Wuille, one of the authors of the SegWit implementation, celebrated his SegWit transaction after its activation, thanking all who helped move it forward. We have seen strong dedication and enthusiasm behind this technology.\nChoice: A Feature, Not a Bug\nBoth efforts behind #UASF and #SegWit2x represented an anomaly \u2014 individuals who acted of their own choice. In the old system of control, this choice represented something that needed to be eliminated. Bitcoin is a departure from that system. The events that unfolded around Bitcoin this last year have shown how the capacity for individuals to make choices, which exists prior to any scientific endeavor, is not a bug. It is not something that needs to be fixed, but is a vital feature.\nIn the story of Neo\u2019s resistance, the Architect shows Neo two doors, one that leads to the salvation of Zion (the entire human race) or another that brings him back to the Matrix, to Trinity, who sacrificed herself to save him and the end of the species. Instead of trusting the third party and complying with the instructions given, he chooses what he knows to be true, that which is verified in his heart and networked with the heart of the other.\nWhat guides his decision is a connection to another human that he feels in the heart, rather than an abstract concept of humanity presented by the Architect. Neo\u2019s choice opens up a new possibility that was previously unavailable: to save both Zion and the woman he loves. His love for Trinity that gives him hope is regarded as an imperfection of humanity, which the creator of the Matrix describes as a fundamental flaw and an \u201canomaly revealed as both beginning and end.\u201d \nYet it is this love that inspires visions; it is the moral code of cryptography and it is what fuels the engine of Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized architecture. In the chaos of Bitcoin\u2019s great civil war of 2017, we have seen this love, embodied by each person\u2019s striving to make links, commit patches and make connections wherever the network could become broken.\nThe creator of this technology saw a different future. Satoshi\u2019s message in the genesis block stands as a warning and a wakeup call. We are all Satoshi. We are the prophecy \u2014 the coming of a new source code and of an emerging P2P network that could crack this system of control and open all to a free society.\nWe are the One we have been waiting for, whose subjective value choice exercised adamantly can bring together two divergent paths toward freedom and end this battle. Computers are a universal machine, and with Bitcoin, programs that we choose to run that express collective values create a universal law of mathematics that cannot be corrupted. We are all united as users before being divided into merchants, miners, wallet providers and developers. We are the architects of our own future created through a consensus built on a perfect market in this harmony of mathematical precision.\nThis is a guest post by Nozomi Hayase.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin is usually not considered the blockchain best suited for self-executing conditional payments, better known as smart contracts. While it does support basic programmability to enable features like time locks and multi-signature (multisig) schemes, competing projects like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic or Qtum are often expected to better support more advanced applications.However, a new wave of research is increasingly questioning this assumption. For example, Scriptless Scripts, a project spearheaded by Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra, cleverly utilizes the magic of cryptography to move smart contracts off-chain, while leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s security, but without requiring extensive smart-contract support on the Bitcoin protocol itself.Along similar conceptual lines, Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) could deploy another class of smart contracts on top of Bitcoin. A project by one of the authors of the original Lightning Network white paper, Tadge Dryja, and recently presented at Scaling Bitcoin Stanford, DLCs could realize blockchain-enforced insurance companies, futures contracts, dollar-pegged coins and much more.Here\u2019s how that works.BetsMany types of smart contracts essentially boil down to \u201cbets.\u201d Let\u2019s say, for example, that someone wants to insure himself against being unable to travel due to a potential pilot strike. That person can then \u201cbet\u201d there will be a strike. If there is no strike, the \u201cbet\u201d is lost as if it were an insurance down payment. If there is a strike, on the other hand, the \u201cbet\u201d is won, like an insurance payout. As a more interesting example perhaps, people can also bet on the price of BTC relative to the US dollar: a futures market. If someone bets that the BTC price will go down, and the BTC price does go down, he \u201cwins\u201d more BTC; if the BTC price goes up, he \u201closes\u201d some BTC. Interestingly, this can be structured to ensure that the person entering into these \u201cbets\u201d is practically guaranteed to end up with the same USD value in BTC regardless of what happens. This can, in turn, be used to realize a \u201cstablecoin\u201d with fixed USD value on Bitcoin's blockchain. (It should be noted that there are extreme examples where this doesn\u2019t hold up, like a scenario where Bitcoin fails completely and BTC drops to zero dollars \u2014 but, in most cases, it works.)However, while these types of smart contracts are interesting, they cannot be executed based on blockchain-based data alone. A blockchain cannot tell whether pilots are striking, nor what the USD/BTC exchange rate is. This requires data input from outside of the blockchain, and this is where \u201coracles\u201d come in.OraclesOracles are essentially trusted sources of information; they provide data that cannot itself be \u201cread\u201d by a blockchain. This data can be inserted into a smart contract, which will then execute based on the oracle\u2019s input.Since the types of smart contracts described above need to rely on such external data sources anyway, it makes sense to leverage the trust in oracles in order to simplify a smart contract. Instead of more complex solutions, oracles can, for example, be \u201cplugged into\u201d a relatively basic multisig scheme.As a simple example, let\u2019s say that next summer Alice and Bob want to bet a bitcoin on the FIFA World Cup final between Argentina and Brazil. Alice thinks Argentina will win; Bob thinks Brazil will. To make this bet blockchain-enforceable, Alice and Bob both send one bitcoin to a multisig address that requires two of three signatures to spend the coins. One of these three keys is held by Alice, another key is held by Bob and the third key is held by the oracle.If Argentina wins, Alice and Bob should both sign a transaction from this address that sends both bitcoins to Alice. Since this requires only two signatures, Alice and Bob\u2019s signatures suffice, and the oracle never comes into play. (Needless to say, if Brazil wins it\u2019s the other way around: Alice and Bob sign a transaction sending both coins to Bob.)A problem arises only when the losing party \u2014 Bob \u2014 refuses to sign the transaction. It\u2019s in this scenario that the oracle would use its third key to help Alice claim the two bitcoins. Importantly, exactly because this is an option, Bob really has no reason not to sign. (This is even more true if Alice and Bob put up some collateral so Bob gets refunded some of his BTC if he signs.) Ideally, the oracle\u2019s signature should hardly ever be needed at all; Alice and Bob can complete the bet on their own.Still, the basic multisig and oracle solution has its weaknesses. For example, the oracle would probably have to be involved with setting up the bet; or at least it should be available to act as a sort of judge whenever needed. This means that the oracle could potentially be corrupted, for example, if Bob offers the oracle a share of the coins if they collude to steal both. And Alice and Bob also have no privacy from the oracle: the oracle will know exactly what they are betting on and how much they are betting. Meanwhile, the rest of the world can tell that Alice and Bob used an oracle for their bet (and, therefore, that it was a bet).These are the problems that Discreet Log Contracts could solve. They maintain the benefits of the straightforward multisig and oracle solution \u2014 but eliminate most of its weaknesses.Payment ChannelsAs mentioned, Dryja, who is currently working for MIT Media Lab\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative, is one of the authors of the lightning network white paper. His DLC project is based on a similar concept. A key idea behind the lightning network is that two people can open a payment channel, allowing them to transact with each other. Such a payment channel utilizes Bitcoin\u2019s basic programmability (like time locks and multisig addresses) and combines it with some clever tricks to commit transactions to other transactions, all without broadcasting them to the network unless needed.Over time, as the people in the channel transact with each other, these payment channels are updated with new balances or \u201cchannel states.\u201d Either party can then \u201cdrop\u201d the latest channel state on the blockchain at any time and claim their balance whenever they want to. And importantly \u2014 this is where Bitcoin\u2019s basic programmability is leveraged \u2014 both parties can only safely broadcast the latest channel state. If they try to cheat by broadcasting an earlier channel state, their counterparty can actually claim every single coin in the channel.DLCs works similarly. But where a lightning network payment channel only lets the parties involved broadcast the most recent channel state, DLCs limit them to broadcasting only the channel state reflecting the correct outcome of a bet.This is where the oracle comes in \u2014 but this time combined with some fancy math tricks.The Oracle SignatureAs opposed to 2-of-3 multisig schemes where oracles act a bit like judges, oracles in DLCs more closely resemble broadcasters. For our World Cup bet, it would make sense that the oracle is a sports-betting service, a football news website, perhaps the FIFA or another entity that broadcasts the winner anyway and that is reasonably trusted not to lie about it.Let\u2019s say the oracle in this case is a sports-betting service that regularly publishes the score and winner of the World Cup final on their website. To enable a DLC, the same sports-betting service only needs to add a minor additional step.Basically, this \u201cbroadcast oracle\u201d has a public key and a private key. (A private key is really just a randomly generated number, while the public key is a seemingly random number derived from that private key.) This public key is published somewhere, most likely on the betting service\u2019s website for anyone to find. The private key is, of course, kept private: This can be used by the oracle to sign a message. (Such a signature, too, is a seemingly random number but is derived from the private key in combination with the message.)The possible outcomes of the bet are known as well: either Argentina wins the World Cup final or Brazil wins. The sports-betting service, therefore, announces that it will broadcast one of two very specific messages: \u201cArgentina won\u201d or \u201cBrazil won.\u201dNow, what\u2019s interesting about public key cryptography is that the sports-betting service\u2019s public key can be used to figure out what a signature of the message \u2014 \u201cArgentina won\u201d or \u201cBrazil won\u201d \u2014 will mathematically \u201clook like.\u201d (\u201cLook like,\u201d in this case, doesn\u2019t mean that Alice and Bob can produce the signature themselves, but they can calculate certain mathematical properties that it will have.)Because Alice and Bob can calculate what the potential oracle signatures will \u201clook like,\u201d they can use it in their DLC.The Discreet Log ContractFirst, before the World Cup final, Alice and Bob pay one bitcoin to a \u201cfunding transaction.\u201d From this funding transaction, several potential transactions are constructed \u2014 but these are not yet broadcast over the network.Here\u2019s where the cryptography gets a bit complex.What the sports-betting service signatures \u201clook like\u201d is cleverly embedded in these several potential transactions, where each potential signature enables a different transaction. (Specifically, and somewhat unconventionally, what the signatures \u201clook like\u201d is used as public keys in key-pairs for the different transactions.)In other words, knowing what the oracle\u2019s potential signatures will \u201clook like,\u201d Alice and Bob can construct their payment channels such that the two different potential signatures can be used to validate two different channel states: one where Alice gets two bitcoins and one where Bob gets them.Then, the actual oracle signature, which is published after the World Cup final is played, is used as private key to validate the winning transaction \u2014 and only the winning transaction. If the sports-betting service broadcasts a signature for \u201cArgentina won,\u201d Alice can take this signature, use it as a private key (in combination with her own private key) and claim the two bitcoins from the channel. If the oracle signs a message for \u201cBrazil won,\u201d Bob can. Meanwhile, if either tries to claim the bitcoins without the oracle signature, they will fail, and their counterparty can instead claim both coins.Further, like lightning network payment channels, the outcome of the bet \u2014 two bitcoins for Alice if Argentina wins \u2014 can now also be broadcast by Alice and Bob as a fairly regular multisig transaction from the funding transaction. And indeed, exactly because Alice can enforce the outcome with the oracle signature anyway, there is little reason for Bob not to cooperate.As a result, the \u201cbet\u201d is fully blockchain-enforced through the sports-betting service\u2019s signature, while this service doesn\u2019t need to do anything for this specific bet; it doesn\u2019t even need to know it ever took place. And, notably, while this bet is relatively simple (either Argentina wins or Brazil wins), in reality DLCs could allow for far more complex scenarios. Exactly because only a fairly regular multisig transaction is broadcasted in the end, it doesn\u2019t really matter if a \u201cbet\u201d has two, 200, or 200,000 potential outcomes.Thanks to Tadge Dryja for information and feedback.

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nSouth Korean exchange Youbit announced on its website today that it is closing down after a hack early Tuesday, December 19, 2017, that resulted in the loss of 17 percent of its assets.The exchange, previously known as Yapizon, did not indicate how many bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies were stolen or what the total fiat value of the attack amounted to, but it was enough to lead to bankruptcy.This was the second hack the exchange suffered this year. A prior attack in April 2017, resulted in the loss of 3,816 bitcoins, worth around $5 million at the time.Youbit said hackers broke into its hot wallet, the online account used to pay out cryptocurrencies instantly. While hot wallets offer greater convenience, they also put funds at greater risk because they are connected to the internet.The remaining coins were kept offline in a cold wallet, the exchange said, resulting in no additional losses. The exchange indicated that customers could withdraw up to 75 percent of their balances, and the rest would be tallied out after the final settlement. Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), the state agency that responds to cyberattacks, is investigating the incident, as reported in Reuters. KISA has maintained that North Korean hackers were behind the first hack. Chris Doman, threat engineer at software security company AlienVault, told Bitcoin Magazine, he suspects BlueNoroff, a subgroup of North Korea\u2019s cyber crime group Lazarus is responsible for the second Youbit attack. Lazarus is known for the November 2014 hack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, one of the biggest corporate breaches in history. While attacks by Lazarus have mainly been aimed at social disruption, recent reports indicate the group is increasingly going after money. With the value of bitcoin surging to all-time highs, exchanges are becoming a lucrative target. \u201cThe first time I saw them target a Bitcoin company was in May this year \u2014 the same month they unleashed WannaCry,\u201d Doman said in a statement shared with Bitcoin Magazine. The exchange that Doman was refering to is South Korean Bitcoin exchange Bithumb. Around that same time, WannaCry ransomware attacks were encrypting user\u2019s computers and offering to de-encrypt them in exchange for bitcoin. Analysis of the techniques used in the WannaCry attacks show strong links to Lazarus. \u00a0Doman added, \u201cThey\u2019ve also used related malware to opportunistically mine Monero coins on compromised servers. Clearly they have a large interest in cryptocurrencies as an easy method for economic gain, as well as an opportunity to economically weaken their enemies.\u201dAlthough Youbit is one of the smaller bitcoin exchanges, the hack underscores the risk involved in leaving funds on an exchange, where control of those funds is handed over to a third party and is only as safe as whatever security measures that exchange chooses to use. Throughout the history of Bitcoin, hacks have amounted to painful losses. When bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox began liquidation proceedings in April 2014, the company announced that approximately 850,000 bitcoins were missing, an amount valued at more than $450 million at the time. In August 2016, the Bitcoin exchange Bitfinex announced hackers stole approximately 120,000\u00a0BTC, worth $72 million at the time. ", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 19}

His interests include technical aspects of a blockchain, upcoming crypto projects and carefully crafted beers. Follow him on Medium and on GitHub.\nBulletproofs, presented in a paper titled \u201cBulletproofs: Short Proofs for Confidential Transactions and More,\u201d describe a new zero-knowledge proof system. The proposal uses on-chain scaling for privacy and suggests a new, faster and more compact way to verify privacy-enhancing Confidential Transactions (CTs). Specifically, Bulletproofs can decrease the size of these verifications for these types of transactions drastically. Furthermore, the authors of the paper \u2014 Stanford University\u2019s Applied Cryptography Group, overseen by professor Dan Boneh \u2014 have already managed to create a practical implementation for Bulletproofs.This is how it works.Currently, all transaction information \u2014 such as wallet addresses and especially the sent amount of bitcoins \u2014 are visible on the Bitcoin blockchain. This affects the privacy of all users. If we wish to pay wages via the Bitcoin network, for example, this means that every salary will be visible on the blockchain network. This, in turn, could mean that someone (like your landlord) could look up how much money you\u2019re making to try and increase your rent accordingly. Confidential Transactions are much needed to bring any type of blockchain to a higher level of privacy. Confidential Transactions combine and utilize several cryptographic tricks so that only the sender and the receiver of a transaction are aware of the amount transacted. These cryptographic tricks let users obfuscate the amounts they are transacting while still allowing onlookers to perform math on the obfuscated amounts. Basically, anyone can still check that the sum of sent bitcoins is greater than the sum of received bitcoins.Confidential Transactions are realized with \u201czero-knowledge proofs.\u201d These proofs are best described as a method for proving to another party that a Confidential Transaction is valid without conveying any information about the Confidential Transaction itself. However, as stated in the Bulletproofs paper: \u201cCurrent proposals for CT zero-knowledge proofs have either been prohibitively large or required a trusted setup. Neither is desirable.\u201dFirst of all, if we have to prove multiple range proofs, which is the case for multisignature transactions, the complexity and size will scale in a linear fashion. For example, if the size of a single proof is 2 kB, two proofs are 4 kB, three proofs are 6 kB and so on.Additionally, zero-knowledge proofs typically require a trusted setup: they must be initialized by some trusted authority. However, the security properties of the Bitcoin system don\u2019t apply to that authority because in practice it means that the authority could produce fake \u201cproofs.\u201d These fake proofs could lead to uncontrolled and undetectable inflation.Bulletproofs could solve these problems.According to the paper, \u201cIn any distributed system where proofs are transmitted over a network or stored for a long time, short proofs reduce overall cost.\u201dBulletproofs are claimed to be able to reduce the cryptographic proof significantly: from 8 kB to 734 bytes, though this depends on what the transaction looks like. Moreover, when dealing with multiple proofs, the size increases with just a few percent instead of this linear scaling. And in addition, Bulletproofs do not require a trusted setup.Andrew Poelstra, contributor to the research paper and mathematician at Blockstream, believes that Bulletproofs are very practical: \u201cWe have already implemented a first version in the Bitcoin crypto library libsec256k1, which can verify proofs three and a half times\u00a0faster\u00a0than the verifier for the classic rangeproofs. It is a drop-in replacement for classic rangeproofs that does not affect other aspects of the system and is therefore very easy to integrate.\u201d Until now, Confidential Transactions were just a theoretical concept because they were so heavy to implement. With Bulletproofs, the implementation of Confidential Transactions on Bitcoin suddenly becomes more likely.", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 20}

He sees that as evidence that bitcoin has proven its stability and staying power to a larger pool of investors.\n\u201cMaybe this is the point where [institutional investors] find it palatable to enter the market,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to enter a market for quick wins; they want to enter a market and purchase an asset because they know it is going to be around for 10 to 20 years, and I think that is what we are seeing now.\u201d\nConcerns\nPatrick McCorry, a cryptocurrency researcher and PhD candidate at University College London, agrees the $10K mark signals a broader acceptance. \u201cI think the fact that it has reached $10K is like a global validation of the entire community\u2019s work and the principles that surround it,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \n\u201cFive years ago, bitcoin was not even accepted as a concept, but over the last four years, it has seen a big push toward social and regulatory acceptance,\u201d he said. For instance, Japan now accepts bitcoin as a currency, whereas in the U.S., the IRS still considers it to be property.\nHe is also concerned that the main driving force of bitcoin is speculation, rather than its utility. \u201cIt\u2019s more a growing population of users who want to make a quick return,\u201d he said. His worry is that if the bubble pops, people will inevitably lose money, and that could be damaging to bitcoin\u2019s image. \n\u201cIt was envisioned to be a payment system,\u201d said McCorry, who pointed out that people are not using bitcoin for that purpose. \n\u201cI attended a bitcoin conference recently. We went to a bitcoin pub and nobody bought pints with bitcoin. The greatest advocates in the space, and nobody used [bitcoin] for its primary purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what is the primary purpose of bitcoin? Is it for payments for digital gold or speculation?\u201d\nProfitable Mining\nMarco Krohn, co-founder and CFO of cryptocurrency mining company Genesis Mining, admits bitcoin\u2019s rapid escalation in price took even him by surprise. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this [space] since 2011, and this is the first time I\u2019ve seen the bitcoin price go up like crazy,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cEverybody who was in the business kind of expected it would go up, but by a factor of 10 was really surprising.\u201d \nHe thinks the price could go even higher, though, especially when making the popular comparison of bitcoin to gold. \u201cYou have to take into account the market capitalization of bitcoin is only two percent of the market cap of gold,\u201d he said. \nAs the price of bitcoin climbs, so does the demand for mining. \n\u201cYou can imagine you are in the gold mining business and the next day, the price of gold is 10 times higher. Everyone would get his axe and dig for gold, and that is what is happening,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this creates a run at the moment for mining because mining is so profitable that everyone wants to do it.\u201d \nAccording to Krohn, cloud miners are struggling to keep up with the demand right now. Recently, when moving to a new facility, Genesis had to sell a lot of its older mining gear to make room for new equipment, but everything sold in a flash. \u201cWithin two and a half days, everything sold,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is just beyond description at the moment.\u201d \nRoad Ahead\nCharles Hoskinson, CEO of blockchain company IOHK, has been in the space long enough to remember when bitcoin was below $5. Over the past five years, he says he has watched the markets move in all kinds of directions. \nIn fact, as this story is being published, after cresting at over $11,000 today, bitcoin has already dipped below $10,000 and then risen again.\nThe current bitcoin market cap is $167 billion, and while Hoskinson thinks $10K is a great \u201cpsychological barrier\u201d to cross, he suspects that with bitcoin\u2019s routine ups and downs, we may see it again. After all, that is just how bitcoin is. In an email to Bitcoin Magazine, he wrote: \u201cWe might be crossing 10k more than once on the ride to a trillion dollar market cap.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 29}

Unfortunately, organizations lack the data they need in order to make informed decisions on what and how they can improve.That is until now.The ixo Foundation, an open source software development foundation, is aiming to optimize impact by combining data with trust to ensure transparency, accountability and security. To achieve this, it\u2019s harnessing blockchain technology and Web 3.0 standards to create the ixo Protocol. It is through this that the foundation will be able to collect and verify high quality data about sustainable development.Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Anne Connelly, network lead at ixo Foundation, said that organizations can build applications via the ixo Protocol, thereby enabling service providers to create an impact claim about the work they have achieved that relates to the SDGs. Connelly used the example of projects that claim to have taught 100 children or planted 10,000 trees.\u201cThe claim is then verified by an evaluator or a data source,\u201d she added. \u201cThis verified impact claim is proof of impact. This proof enables increased access to social impact bonds, government subsidies and other types of impact funding.\u201dBy validating the work that has been achieved, it reduces fraud, costs and corruption while giving the service provider and the funder valuable insight and proof of the work achieved. The data then becomes part of a global impact ledger, an open data commons that can be accessed by anyone, enabling governments, researchers, funders and organizations to make more informed decisions about their work and how to optimize their impact, said Connelly.\u201c[The] blockchain is a critical technology for changing the way we approach sustainable development,\u201d she said, adding that the protocol would not be possible without it. \u201cThe ixo Protocol leverages public, public permissioned and private layers to ensure maximum functionality using blockchain technology while maintaining data privacy.\u201dSince November 2016, the ixo Foundation has been working with its founding partner, Innovation Edge, and funder, Unicef, on an application called Amply that supports early childhood development. Connelly explained that, in South Africa, many parents can\u2019t afford to send their children to preschool, a critical time in a child\u2019s development. In order to rectify this, the South African government has a subsidy programme to support over 800,000 children to attend preschool.\u201cHowever, in order for teachers to access these subsidies they must track attendance through an antiquated paper-based system and have the papers checked at a government office every quarter,\u201d said Connelly.Through the Amply project, which has now been through over a year of field testing, a basic mobile application was built using the ixo Protocol to enable teachers to track attendance digitally. With each positive attendance record, an impact claim is made, delivering greater access to government subsidies, which, in turn, means more underprivileged children being taught at school.\u201cTo date, Amply is being used in over 72 schools across the country and has recorded more than 45,000 attendances,\u201d said Connelly. \u201cThrough these trials, we have found that the digitized system has saved more than 4,000 hours every month.\u201dAccess to a decentralized global ledger of data will answer the UN\u2019s called for a data revolution for sustainable development. According to a press release from the UN, in 2015, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said \u201cgood data and statistics are indispensable for informed decision-making by all actors in society.\u201d\u201cBy tackling an issue that is at the foundation of every organization\u2019s ability to succeed \u2014 high quality data \u2014 we\u2019re enabling every funder, government and service provider to optimize their impact and achieve the UN\u2019s SGDs by 2030,\u201d stated Connelly.On October 27, 2017, ixo Foundation announced that it had partnered with Singularity University\u2019s SU Ventures and ConsenSys\u2019 Blockchain for Social Impact Coalition (BSIC), both of which give it greater access to important resources.Image courtesy of ixo Foundation", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 1}
{"title": "Local Meetups: Growing Bitcoin and Blockchain Tech at the Grassroot Level", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/local-meetups-growing-bitcoin-and-blockchain-tech-grassroot-level/", "birthday": "Dec 1, 2017  8:50 AM EST", "date": "2017-12-01 13:50:00", "content": "Shawn Gordon founded multiple companies from multi-platform software products to a leading genre record label. He's spent years building products and solutions, all the while writing over 300 articles for various magazines covering software reviews, programming tips, interviews and music piracy.\nBitcoin is exploding and interest in the associated blockchain technology is at an all-time high, with Bitcoin being talked about on sitcoms as well as the news. But much of this success has been the result of a vibrant grassroots movement that has been fostered over time by dedicated and devoted communities of crypto enthusiasts around the world.Bitcoin Magazine spoke with several blockchain Meetup organizers around the world to find out more about their groups and how they started them, grew them and kept people coming.West Palm Beach, FLJohn P. Riley is one of the organizers for the West Palm Beach Government Blockchain Association Meetup in Florida. They started just a few months ago and have over 100 members with about half signed up for the next meeting. His Meetup is a \u201cchapter\u201d of the Government Blockchain Association, which is not part of any government; rather, it is trying to facilitate education and use of blockchain technology in the public and private sectors.When Riley started his group, he reached out to all the other Meetup groups in the area and met the organizers for lunch to facilitate a cooperative spirit and organization so that they didn\u2019t set up conflicting meetings. Riley\u2019s focus is on making the Meetup experience comfortable and relevant for his attendees. He makes sure that there is an opportunity for people to network ahead of any presentations. And because his group is new, he has been paying expenses for things like food out of his own pocket in order to keep the Meetup free of charge. Riley said, \u201cWe\u2019re not selling anything here. We want to add value in a non-intrusive fashion so people are comfortable coming and don\u2019t think it is an MLM [multi-level marketing] presentation. We have done really well so far getting local business and government workers to the meetings. My discussions with the other local Meetup leaders helped me learn about best practices for promoting on social media and that has been very helpful; we are also talking about setting up complementary topics so attendees have a reason to cycle around between the different groups.\u201dSeoul, South KoreaRuben Somsen is one of the organizers for the Seoul Bitcoin Meetup in South Korea. They have nearly 2,000 members and an average of 50 attendees at their monthly meetings. He started his group in 2013 in a casual fashion after he first became obsessed with Bitcoin and wanted to talk to others about it. No other group existed at the time in Seoul.What Somsen found useful to grow the group originally was consistent Meetups \u2014 same time and same place. It needed to be beginner-friendly and provide interesting content, while walking the fine line between welcoming newcomers and keeping it engaging for the regulars. He solved this in part by having more advanced Meetups for the regulars, but in the end, having a solid reputation has been what has mattered most in terms of attendance. He had originally allowed non-Bitcoin projects to present, but over time, said Somsen, those pitches had a tendency to turn into sales pitches, so he stopped.\u201cIf you are truly an enthusiast and not in it for the money then stick with your principles,\u201d Somsen advised. \u201cThe space is overrun with nonsensical altcoins, blockchains and ICOs that you\u2019ll have to avoid. If you provide the right environment, then the real enthusiasts will find your Meetup, and they are the ones that make your community valuable. The rest of the crowd will follow naturally.\u201dDubai, U.A.E.Adam Schneider is one of the organizers for the Bitcoin Dubai Meetup in the U.A.E., with about 2,200 members and an average of 75 that come to their monthly meetings. The group has existed for four years now and grew quite organically. They have done no promotion at all other than announcing their meetings on Meetup; everyone has just found them by doing Google or Meetup searches or have been referred by people who have attended.\u201cI encourage people to attend by trying to provide great content at every Meetup and by building friendships so we can have a nice and strong community,\u201d said Schneider. This is what drives him to find particular speakers and sponsors. He keeps the Meetup free of charge, but when there are sponsors, then they have free food and drinks. He schedules his Meetups months in advance so everyone is able to schedule with plenty of notice. He takes extra care to screen any companies that want to be involved to make sure they aren\u2019t scammers or some get-rich-quick scheme, which has become all too common in this sector.Orange County, CASean Goodwin is the organizer for the Ethereum Orange County Meetup in California, with about 1,000 members (tripled in the last three months) and averaging nearly 200 attendees per meeting, which they have two to four times a month. \u201cSomething as simple as food will get people out,\u201d said Goodwin. \u201cWe supply food and drinks that have been sponsored by corporations. In fact, this cooperation between corporations with a Bitcoin interest and Meetups has been very successful for us so far. We\u2019ve had a sponsor for every event for some time now.\u201dGoodwin continued, \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of success in reaching out to local conferences and seminars and having them provide giveaways that people are interested in, like a free ticket to their conference, and in return, we promote their conference at our Meetup. This creates value for everyone. I like to support all the other Meetups in the area by going to their meetings and coordinating so people don\u2019t have to choose between groups.\u201dGoodwin likes to make sure that people have time to network before and after the speakers. \u201cFor a lot of people, this is their favorite part of the group,\u201d he noted.In order spread the word and be sure that the Meetup is addressing topics that people are interested in, organizers engage with their members on social media. Goodwin has also recently started putting out questionnaires to rate people\u2019s interest in various speakers and topics. \u201cI\u2019m always amazed at the number of people that are entirely new to blockchain [technology] that come to our meetings; it helped me realize how important it is to cater the topics so they aren\u2019t over the heads of someone that is totally new and are still interesting to the general group. We started having colored name badges that indicate your area of expertise to help people connect quickly and that has been popular.\u201dGhent, BelgiumRoeland Creve is one of the organizers for the Cryptocurrencies & Decentralized Innovation Meetup in Ghent, Belgium. They have over 800 members and an average of 50 attendees at their regular meetings and 25 at their beer Meetups. According to Creve, \u201cWe started the group with a post on Bitcointalk in October 2013. It was just a loose gathering of people who were interested in Bitcoin. We have never had a \u2018president.\u2019 The management has been done, since the beginning, by a loose group of people who want to do the work (planning the Meetups, planning the talks, outreach, etc.).\u201dTo promote the group, they organized Gent Bitcoincity and contacted various university student groups, as well as the Belgian Bitcoin Association. They plan several Meetups in advance and get it on the Meetup calendar and send out the notices, without any other social media outreach. To get speakers, they are mostly supported by people asking to present, and they organize the calendar to support them. Their approach is to screen out pumpters, ICOs or anyone encouraging any sort of investment. Their reputation is such that they rarely get these requests anymore.They don\u2019t charge for their Meetups as they have worked out an arrangement with two local bars that they alternate between. One is the \u201cbeer Meetup\u201d that is more of a networking event, and the other is a larger facility where presentations happen. They did a fundraiser once and received 1 BTC in donations; this has covered their other costs so far.Creve also cooperates with the Meetup in Brussels, and they sometimes attend each other\u2019s Meetups and support one another.The common thread among these groups is that a passion for the topic is really key, and that this isn\u2019t a competitive environment. The most successful Meetups are the ones that are reaching out and working together to help each other grow. With cooperation, there is a tremendous opportunity for synergistic relationships to develop that help everyone.The key to success on this is being passionate and involved yourself; you want a group that is something that you would personally want to be a part of. I just love this space and all the energy and excitement. It really drives me. \u2014 Sean Goodwin, Orange County", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 1}

She has lived in Tel Aviv \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest startup capitals \u2013 and currently resides in San Francisco. You can follow her on Twitter at\u00a0@Rachelwolf00.\nThe promise of a new economy built upon a decentralized government can offer a number of benefits to millions of people across the globe. More and more cryptocurrency platforms are being created to ensure faster, more secure payments, data protection, lower transaction fees and other advantages accessible to anyone who wishes to participate.\u00a0\u00a0And as crypto platforms get more creative to offer individuals a number of rewards via tokens, a new \u201cproof of time\u201d protocol is emerging to help users monetize every minute of their day. Just imagine living in a society where people get rewarded for their time spent playing video games or reading articles online.This concept is exactly what three emerging cryptocurrency platforms aim to achieve. Mytime, Stream and Brave Browser are all offering tokens for the time people spend using services, creating video content and even browsing the internet. Rather than feeling like time is being wasted, these platforms are helping users \u2014 and service providers \u2014 make the most of every minute of their days.MytimeYouTube recently revealed that a billion hours are spent on its video streaming site daily. Users are also using on-demand service apps more than ever before. As a result, users spend thousands of hours each day on various apps and services. And while these platforms are benefiting greatly, users never see any tangible profits.A new cryptocurrency platform called mytime aims to change this business model. Recently launched on October 31, the open-source blockchain-based platform operates by converting time spent using a service to cryptocurrency tokens called MYTC. Users are able to spend these tokens on additional service time or on services provided by other companies participating on the mytime platform. Alternatively, users will also be able to convert these tokens to fiat currency. \u00a0As with most blockchain platforms, both parties end up benefiting. With mytime, users will earn MYTC cryptocurrency based on the time they spend using a service. The service providers partnering with mytime also have the opportunity to simultaneously earn MYTC by attracting loyal users to their platforms.Mytime\u2019s system functions on two parallel blockchains to ensure accurate proof of time. One is used to confirm the elapsed time a user spends on a platform for a service. This cannot exceed 24 hours a day and automatically prevents users from logging the same time period for more than one service. The second records the participating company\u2019s MYTC reward dispensation. Token transfer will then occur in users\u2019 and service partners\u2019 applications on the MYTC online wallet. Users can spend earned MYTC rewards on any other mytime participating sites, or the rewards can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies on the mytime exchange.StreamThe most-followed YouTubers \u2014 those with 7 million subscribers or more \u2014 are able to earn about $300,000 for a video partnership. However, this isn\u2019t always the case for all video content creators; even some major YouTube influencers are still unable to successfully monetize their content. This is especially disappointing considering how much time and effort goes into making YouTube video that generate millions of views.YouTube continues to reign supreme in terms of revenue though, while their users often get paid very little for their time. A new decentralized, blockchain-based token called Stream aims to change this, allowing video content creators to be fairly rewarded for their time.Launched this past September, Stream incentivizes new and existing video creators to make great content by automatically distributing newly minted tokens (directly exchangeable for any global currency) to creators based on their contributions to the ecosystem. This creates a system where, for the first time ever, video content creators are able to get paid directly for their work, without cost to viewers and without the need to rely on brand endorsements.Stream also allows livestreamers to easily and anonymously accept payments from their global audience members with extremely low transaction fees, without platform lock-in. These innovations enable a fully decentralized system where content creators earn more, viewers pay less, and the industry is no longer dependent on advertising and big-brand partnerships to survive. Brave Browser and the BATOverall, browsing the internet is one of the most time-consuming activities individuals partake in. And while millions of users spend endless hours online, even more time is spent due to the amount of ads that pop up during a browsing session.In order to solve this problem, the co-founder of Mozilla, Brendan Eich, created a niche browser called Brave. Brave\u2019s initial business model gained much attention, as it was known for blocking all ads, as well as ad trackers shown by website publishers. This business model relied on scrubbing websites of ads and ad tracking, then replacing those ads with its own. This model was not aimed at individuals but at the anonymous aggregate of the browser\u2019s user base. If enough people used the browser, Brave would share its ad revenue with users and content creators. Known as \u201cBrave Payments,\u201d this would replace existing ad revenue. Brave Payments were made with bitcoin and funded by users. Website publishers were paid from users\u2019 virtual wallets and Brave took a 5 percent cut from each wallet. However, several complaints were issued by various online publishers around this business model, noting that this practice violated federal laws. Brave looked toward blockchain technology as an alternative to replace Brave Payments and recently launched a cryptocurrency project called BAT, which stands for \u201cBasic Attention Token.\u201d In order to solve the problems associated with digital advertising, Brave\u2019s BAT aims to put a price on online users\u2019 attention with blockchain-based tokens that will be traded among publishers, advertisers and those willing to view ads.Through this model, advertisers can provide publishers with BATs based on the measured attention on ads from users. In turn, users will also receive some BATs for participating, which can be donated back to publishers or used on the platform. In a nutshell, users are essentially being rewarded for the time they spend viewing ads online.Cryptocurrency platforms such as mytime, Stream and Brave Browser\u2019s BAT are just a few examples of new ways digital currency is being applied to help us make the most of our time. Other similar models, like Vezt, are also starting to emerge as this concept gains traction. Finally, content creators, internet users, service providers and more are able to earn currency for time spent doing what they enjoy.", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 1}

In a very rare event, bitcoin actually managed to break the upper parabolic curve and squeeze out a new all-time high in the upper $11,000s:Figure 1: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro Parabolic TrendAlthough bitcoin broke the parabolic trend on the smaller timescales, the chart above shows that bitcoin is still being governed by the parabolic resistance \u2014 an outlier in an otherwise parabolic trend. Something very important to note about the parabolic breakout is the amount of volume on the move: It was the highest volume seen at top of a trend in the last two years \u2014 it\u2019s continuing to increase.Figure 2: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Zoomed-in View of Macro TrendTaking a closer look at the daily candles near the edge of the upper parabolic curve, we see a textbook reversal candle called a \u201cReversal Doji\u201d (often just called \u201cDoji\u201d). This is a point where volume is high but overall price movement is low. Thus, supply is approximately equal to demand and it poises the market for a potential reversal. Although the current daily candle is still forming, it\u2019s showing an increase in supply (downward price movement) and the volume is continuing to grow as the day moves on. Figure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Week Candles, Macro Parabolic TrendAnd so the story goes on the weekly candles. Sitting at the top of our 2.5 year bull market, a reversal candle is in the process of being formed. Thus, the higher timescales are indicating a balance of supply and demand and offering an opportunity to the market for a reversal. It should be noted that the current weekly candle still has a couple more days left on it and is in the process of forming. For those playing the macro markets, keep a close eye on this candle as it will give hints as to the likely direction of the market in the coming weeks/months.On a macro scale, support lies on the linear and parabolic trendlines shown in Figure 1 and are likely to alleviate any potential downward movement in the coming days and weeks. As with any market setup or potential trend reversal, wait for confirmation of candle closes before acting and expect the unexpected.Summary:Bitcoin managed to establish another new all-time high in the upper $11,000s.As of the time of this article, the parabolic envelope is providing solid resistance while the market tries to find solid support.Macro time frames are beginning to show signs of supply dominating the market. Should the market continue to pull back further, support can be found on the parabolic and linear trendlines outlined in Figure 1.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

He's spent years building products and solutions, all the while writing over 300 articles for various magazines covering software reviews, programming tips, interviews and music piracy.\nCryptocurrency has opened up a new world in the financial sector that was primarily owned by banks, namely the borrowing and lending of capital.While peer-to-peer borrowing and lending has developed in recent years in the fiat currency space, it is only recently that companies have been finding methods of replicating these ideas in the cryptocurrency space. What follows is a short evaluation of several available options.SALTSALT is a lending platform for blockchain-backed loans. No credit check is required: Users purchase\u00a0 ERC20 SALT tokens to become a member and then put up bitcoin or other blockchain-backed assets as collateral. They can then borrow money from the platform's network of lenders. Once the loan is paid back, borrowers get their crypto back: There are no prepayment penalties. SALT makes no guarantee that a sufficient pool of liquidity is available to fulfill every loan request right away, however, even for approved borrowers. If the pool of money provided by the lenders is all lent out, then prospective borrowers will have to wait for more lenders to enter the system or for funds to be paid back into it.The cost of one SALT token is set at $25. Tokens are currently sold within the SALT system; however, the token is also available on several exchanges where it is currently trading at about $4. SALT is used to pay for your membership in the SALT system; it is a tiered annual fee that varies based on the size of the loan. At the bottom is 1 SALT that covers up to $10,000 and at the top it is 100 SALT to borrow over $1,000,000 with various tiers in between. Interest rates on the loans themselves will vary between 10 percent and 15 percent, depending on the terms of the individual loans. When borrowers apply for a loan, the available options are then presented and they can choose among them. All of the member lenders at SALT are Accredited Investors under Regulation D of 17 CFR \u00a7 230.501 et seq., who have passed the SALT Lending Suitability Test. The loans are not transferable via blockchain; they are themselves securities that are transferable through existing financial channels.Unchained CapitalUnchained Capital is very similar to SALT in that it provides loans against your bitcoin capital. Their details are easier to find on their website than SALT, namely the following:Interest rate is 10 \u201314 percent APR inclusive of all interest and feesTerms are 3 \u2013 24 months with options to renewLoan to value ratio is 50 percent. Borrow $1 for each $2 you deposit as capitalBorrow up to $1 million without a credit checkMake monthly payments on the interest. Due in full on the final paymentCEO Joe Kelly told Bitcoin Magazine that Unchained Capital is working with accredited investors and small institutions. They are specifically reaching out to partners to work with them and do not have any public call for investors. Interested investors, however, can contact them and see about working with them. Their current lending fund is over $10 million at the time of this writing.EthLendEthLend has more of a full free-market approach as a facilitating platform. Borrowers and lenders can use their system to connect and negotiate everything from interest rate to duration. The platform is entirely based on Ethereum, any other ERC20 tokens are admissible as collateral on the loan. If borrowers fail to abide the terms of the smart contract, then all collateral is forfeit. This setup is similar to what is currently available with many peer-to-peer fiat lending options. The price of the LEND token is not clear because of various discounts and the highly fluctuating price of ether right now, but the purpose of the token is to provide discounts on the fees charged to use their system.OtheraOthera says they use blockchain technology to facilitate digital loan contracts, manage their risk and tokenize the repayment cashflow. There has been news going around about the company since the middle of 2016, but their website offers no demonstrations and very few details. A recent partnership announced with London-based commercial real estate lending company Lendhaus indicates big things are in the works, but the Lendhaus website itself is very slim on details and their Twitter profile was only recently created and has no tweets. It isn\u2019t clear if the platform is currently available. Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Othera reps for more information but has not yet received a response.EverexEverex has been in the press for over a year and touts a number of products and services, such as the ability to transfer, borrow and trade in any fiat currency around the world. One aspect is their EVX token which provides a multitude of utility functions in their microfinance and payment program. EVX token ownership is required to access the system and can also be earned as an incentive or reward based on terms the lenders can specify. Those same EVX tokens can then be used as collateral for secured lending. To use their platform you need to either install their mobile wallet or use their Everex web service. There is a lot of activity in other parts of the financial market with regard to cryptocurrency as well, such as tokenizing real world assets as investment vehicles. What this tells us is that there is a lot of interest and activity in this space that is certainly going to change the face of banking.Note: This article is for informational purposes only.

A single attack is preceded by a quiet (attack free) period of at least 60 minutes and followed by another quiet period of the same duration or longer. Previous Imperva reports had considered DDoS attack bursts separated by 10 minute quiet periods, but then increased the quiet period time threshold to 60 minutes in order to aggregate successive attacks.DDoS attacks can be either network layer attacks that cause network saturation by consuming much of the available bandwidth or application layer attacks that bring down a server by consuming much of its processing resources (e.g., CPU or RAM) with a high number of requests; they are often facilitated by DDoS botnets. DDoS bots often masquerade as browsers (human visitors) or legitimate bots (e.g., search engine crawlers) to bypass security measures.The Imperva report is based on data from 3,920 network layer and 1,755 application layer DDoS attacks on websites using Imperva Incapsula services from July 1, 2017, through September 30, 2017. Information about DDoS botnets was gathered by analyzing data from 37.4 billion DDoS attack requests collected over the same period.Network layer DDoS attacks are measured in Mpps (million packets per second) and Gbps (gigabits per second), which indicate, respectively, the rate at which packets are delivered and the total load placed on a network. Five percent of network layer attacks reached 50 Mpps, while the largest peaked at 238 Mpps.Application layer DDoS attacks are measured in RPS (requests per second), and the overall impact also depends on the amount of workload that a single request can force on a target server. The main difference between the two DDoS-attack types is that one will target network connections and the other will target computing resources; each requires a different set of security methods for risk mitigation.The report noted that the cryptocurrency industry continues to be a frequent target of DDoS attacks, more so than many larger industries. In fact, three out of every four bitcoin sites were attacked in Q3 2017. \u201c[We] saw attacks targeting a relatively high number of cryptocurrency exchanges and services,\u201d states the report. \u201cThis was likely related to a recent spike in the price of bitcoin, which more than doubled in the span of the quarter. Overall, more than 73% of all bitcoin sites using our services were attacked this quarter, making it one of the most targeted industries, despite its relatively small size and web presence.\u201dOther sectors frequently targeted by DDoS attacks are internet service providers and online gambling and gaming operators.For network layer DDoS attacks, the U.S., China, Hong Kong and the Philippines are among the top five countries, in terms of both number of attacks received and number of targets. Germany is also frequently attacked, with 12.8 percent of the total number of DDoS attacks.Hong Kong had only 5.1 percent of targets but was targeted by almost a third of all network layer attacks in Q3 2017. This was largely due to a large-scale campaign against a local hosting service provider which was hit more than 700 times throughout the quarter.For application layer DDoS attacks, the U.S. had both the highest number of attacks and the highest number of targets, with the Netherlands coming in a distant second. The largest application layer attack targeted a financial services company headquartered in Europe, which was hit multiple times. The remainder of the list include developed countries with mature digital marketplaces, such as Singapore, Japan and Australia. Identifying the origination of DDoS bots is difficult because the practice of faking a source IP \u2014 called IP spoofing \u2014 can make IP geo-data collected during DDoS attacks unreliable. IP spoofing is only possible for network layer attacks, however, since full TCP connections must be established before sending requests in application layer attacks. Thus, only data from application layer attacks was used to identify bot location.In Q3 2017, 17 percent of botnet traffic originated in China, which represents a significant drop from the previous quarter, when China was the source of 63 percent of botnet traffic. Turkey and India are on the rise and account for 7.2 and 4 percent of botnet traffic respectively. China remains the top location of attack devices with over 40 percent of the total.Application layer attack traffic generated by bots that can bypass cookie challenges increased to 6.4 percent in Q3 2017 from 2.1 percent in the previous quarter. Of these bots,1.8 percent were also able to parse JavaScript, an increase from 1.4 percent in Q2 2017.", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 5}

Over the last few weeks, there has been a surge in volume as it pushed out of its multi-month trading range:Figure 1: ETH-USD, 12-Hour Candles, Macro TrendThe several months ether spent consolidating appears to have formed a macro Reaccumulation Phase that led to a breakout of the trading range on strong volume; ultimately yielding our current market position in the $450s. A Reaccumulation Phase is a pause after a strong uptrend that attempts to shake out weak shareholders as the market consolidates toward the stronger holders of a given commodity. A Reaccumulation Phase is intended to torture the weak holders of a commodity into ultimately relinquishing their market share to the stronger market players, before a strong, upward continuation of the previous trend kicks back in.Some of the characteristics of a Reaccumulation Phase include strong buyback on the dips with high volume and wide candle spread:Figure 2: ETH-USD, 12 HR Candles, Volume and Price MovementWhen analyzing trading ranges, it is paramount to contextualize the price movement and the volume. Doing so reveals the intent of the larger market players and will help give traders insight into the potential strength (or weakness) of their investments. Throughout the length of the trading range, it is common to see several tests of both the upper and lower boundaries (the blue horizontal lines). One key trait we are looking for when identifying a Reaccumulation Phase is the increase in volume as the stock (or coin in our case) begins to rally toward the latter end of the trading range:Figure 3: ETH-USD, 12 Hour Candles, Trading Range BreakoutAlthough the current market trend is somewhat consolidating in these higher price levels, it is a very bullish sign that we have broken out of the trading range and done so on increasing volume. This trend shows that the market is now dominated by demand and all the free-floating supply has been absorbed. As the market begins to test new highs, wait for volume to increase to confirm strength in the upward direction.Summary:ETH-USD broke out of a potential, multi-month reaccumulation phase. Increasing volume on the move out of the trading range gives us confidence in a bullish continuation.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nBitfinex, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency trading platform, has hired Steptoe & Johnson, a heavy-hitting, international law firm based in Washington, D.C., to try to put an end to what their PR firm calls \u201ca campaign of mistruth.\u201dAccording to an earlier statement issued by Ronn Torossian, CEO of 5W, the PR company representing the exchange, Bitfinex is \u201csignaling to those who engage in this activity that they are serious about protecting the truth and their business.\u201d Steptoe & Johnson is known for its work in the digital currency space. The firm leads the Blockchain Alliance, a coalition of blockchain companies and U.S. and international law enforcement agencies around the world. Although Bitfinex did not spell out exactly whom it was threatening to take legal action against, the announcement comes at a time when blogger Bitfinex\u2019ed has been persistently denouncing the company in a series of detailed Medium posts and ongoing tweets. Other critics have been taking their swings at Bitfinex as well. \u201cTo date, every claim made by these bad actors has been patently false and made simply to agitate the cryptocurrency ecosystem,\u201d Stuart Hoegner, in-house counsel for Bitfinex, said in the announcement. \u201cAs a result, Bitfinex has decided to assert all of its legal rights and remedies against these agitators and their associates.\u201dThe BackstoryBitfinex, incorporated in the Virgin Islands, is closely tied to cryptocurrency company Tether, based in Hong Kong. Both companies are owned and operated by the same individuals, as revealed in recently leaked documents.Tether issues a token (USDT) that is pegged, or tethered, to the U.S. dollar. Essentially, one USDT is supposed to represent one dollar. By trading their bitcoin or other cryptocurrency for USDT, traders can essentially park their funds in a stable asset to preserve capital. In that sense, Tether works something like a money market account. Tether also allows traders to move their money between exchanges without going through a bank. Bitfinex does not support bitcoin-to-fiat trading or withdrawals, so if traders on Bitfinex want to sell their bitcoin for fiat, they would have to transfer their bitcoin to a regulated exchange like U.S.-based Coinbase, which links to users\u2019 bank accounts, allowing them to make direct fiat deposits and withdrawals. In August 2016, Bitfinex was hacked, losing 120,000 BTC, worth roughly $72 million at the time. Rather than declare bankruptcy, the exchange came up with a three-part strategy. First, it spread the loss out evenly among all its customers, giving everyone a 36 percent haircut and then issuing \u201cBFX tokens\u201d as I.O.U.\u2019s to be redeemed at a later date. Next, in mid-October, Bitfinex offered to allow its customer to convert their BFX tokens to equity in iFinex, the parent company that operates Bitfinex. As a result, roughly a third of all BFX tokens were converted. Finally, in April 2017, Bitfinex bought back all of the remaining BFX tokens and announced it was clear of debt. Allegations and ConcernsAt issue right now is the fact that more than 800 million USDT are in circulation, but so far, Tether has not shown any real proof that it has the money to back up those tokens. Bitfinex\u2019ed claims Bitfinex/Tether is creating that money out of thin air. He also claims Bitfinex is manipulating the markets through techniques such as spoofing \u2014 where a trader puts in a large bid or ask order to make the price of bitcoin go up or down before canceling the order \u2014 and wash trading, where an asset is bought and sold simultaneously to give the impression it is in more demand than it actually is. \u00a0He also argues Bitfinex is operating a Ponzi scheme, paying back its debt through accounting tricks, to avoid becoming insolvent after it was hacked in August 2016.But while Bitfinex is trying to protect its image by threatening legal actions against its critics, Stephen Palley, an attorney at Anderson Kill in Washington, D.C., who focuses on software development, thinks Bitfinex would do better by simply being more transparent.\u201cWhy don\u2019t they just open their books?,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWhat are they afraid of? They are going to have to do that in discovery and litigation anyhow.\u201d To win in court, Bitfinex would have to prove that the blogger was making claims that were false and unsubstantiated, which would require them to come clean themselves. \u201cIt looks to me like they are using heavy-handed intimidation tactics to shut down someone they claim is inconsequential,\u201d said Palley. Bitfinex\u2019ed recently tweeted his bitcoin wallet address and said he is seeking donations to defend himself against possible upcoming litigation. One person has already donated 1 BTC (currently worth $11,500). \u201cThis is bloody bananas,\u201d Bitfinex\u2019ed told Bitcoin Magazine, in response to the hiring of Steptoe. The blogger cited a previous lawsuit filed by Bitfinex, which he claims the exchange had no plans of following through on. In April 2017, Bitfinex filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo for suspending its U.S. dollar wire transfers. That suit was withdrawn a week later. \u201cBest to be prepared,\u201d Bitfinex\u2019ed said. \u201cIf this is [a] big bluff on their end then money goes to charity, I can't hold the bitcoins while whistleblowing.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 5}
{"title": "The Promise and Regulatory Challenge of \"Physical\" Bitcoins", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/promise-and-regulatory-challenge-physical-bitcoins/", "birthday": "Dec 4, 2017  1:55 PM EST", "date": "2017-12-04 18:55:00", "content": "Physical bitcoins that can be exchanged like cash have been discussed for years. In 2010, Gavin Andresen himself started a Bitcoin Forum discussion on possible ways to \u201cprint out bitcoins to function as user-created paper money.\u201d Physical bitcoins have been often implemented, but there are several challenges. Many physical bitcoin operators active a few years ago have either disappeared or don\u2019t show signs of recent activity. Others are just novelty collectibles that don\u2019t store actual bitcoins. But there are still some interesting options both on the horizon and on the market in the physical bitcoin space.Physical bitcoins are a real killer app for many reasons, first and foremost because they can be exchanged privately and anonymously without leaving any trace whatsoever, just like cash. Of course, this is exactly the reason regulators hate the idea and will do anything to stop physical bitcoins from spreading. Also, designing physical bitcoins with both high security and high usability is difficult.In an ideal world, simple paper wallets could be used as physical bitcoins. In fact, anyone can make a paper wallet, load it with any amount of BTC, print it out and give it to anyone. The recipient can easily check the balance before accepting the paper wallet and folding it in their physical wallet for further use, just like cash.Of course, in the real world the chain will be broken very soon. Since both the public and the private keys are nicely printed on a paper wallet, anyone can empty the paper wallet after having passed it on. This forces the very first recipient to empty the wallet themselves immediately after receiving it, but then the transaction isn\u2019t more private than a normal bitcoin transaction between the first and the second (last) owner.It\u2019s worth noting, in passing, that this simple chain of trust would only work among people who really trust each other. For example, members of a closed club with strong entry vetting could use bitcoin paper wallets as internal currency for goods and services exchanged within the club.In practice, physical bitcoins must have private keys (or equivalent) hidden in a tamper-proof way. One possibility is to use scratch cards like Crypto Scratch Cards (now discontinued). One of the first attempts at developing physical bitcoins, dubbed Bitbills, announced in May 2011, used a credit card-like form with an anti-counterfeiting hologram and a QR code embedded within the card, which could not be read without the card showing evidence of tampering. The project was abandoned a few months after being announced.Another possibility is to manufacture physical bitcoins with the public key visible on the outside, but the private key (or equivalent) hidden inside or by a tamper-evident seal. This method was used by late lamented Casascius Physical Bitcoins, which were discontinued in November 2013 after the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a branch of the Treasury Department, informed developer Mike Caldwell that minting physical bitcoins qualified him as a money transmitter business with heavy compliance requirements.Today, there are a few options that seems to have worked out most of these difficulties. The physical bitcoins sold by Denarium, headquartered in Finland, have a private key inside the coin and use a hologram as an anti-counterfeiting measure. \u201cThe hologram has a \u2018window\u2019 where a portion of the public Bitcoin address of the coin can be read for checking balance and loading bitcoins to the coin,\u201d states the Denarium website. Denarium coins come in two versions, one loaded with a predefined amount, and an \u201cempty\u201d version that must be loaded by the users themselves by sending bitcoins to the coin\u2019s address. Due to regulations, only empty coins can be sold to U.S. residents.All Denarium coins, including pre-loaded ones, can be reloaded by sending bitcoins to the coin\u2019s address. A Denarium coin can be redeemed \u201cby opening the hologram sticker and importing the private key underneath to the wallet of your choice,\u201d reads the Denarium user guide. \u201cPlease note that an opened hologram sticker implies that the coin has been spent. The hologram sticker cannot be put back after opening so it should not be removed without the intent to spend the bitcoins.\u201dOpendime, a tiny USB flash drive that can be loaded with bitcoin by the first user and passed along, is more of a light hardware wallet than a heavy paper wallet. Unlike most other options, the private key attached to each Opendime is generated by the device at the time of setup by the user: It is not known by anyone, not even by the first owner. Opendimes can be passed along multiple times to other users and verified; however, it can only be redeemed by the last user, who must break the device to access the private key and import it into any bitcoin wallet.A pack of three Opendimes can be ordered for $37.50. Though perhaps too technically demanding for casual Bitcoin users and too expensive for small values (the device is useless after getting the funds out), Opendimes are certainly usable as physical bitcoins. Earlier this month Fintech Select, a provider of prepaid card programs, mobile banking solutions, announced that it will be launching a test pilot project for physical bitcoins associated with the company\u2019s Selectcoin product line. Another interesting idea, which has been discussed a few times on Bitcoin Forum (e.g. 1, 2, 3), is that of \u201chijacking\u201d physical banknotes to carry a value in bitcoin. A physical bill (say a $1 bill) identified by a serial number would be assigned a value in bitcoin (say 0.1 BTC) and used as a physical bitcoin bill, with robust anti-counterfeiting measures automatically provided courtesy of the state.The idea was presented in a recent tweet by Andreas Antonopoulos. Cryptographer and Bitcoin developer Sergio Demian Lerner replied: \u201cNot a bad idea: I proposed this seriously in 2013.\u201d\npic.twitter.com/JGvY8DvDWn\u2014 Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop) October 12, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI found one of those powerful ideas that are so simple, but so odd at first sight, that can go unnoticed,\u201d said Lerner in his 2013 post, inspired by a Bitcoin Forum discussion. \u201cThe idea is that people could use fiat banknotes as a medium to transfer bitcoins, for offline Bitcoin payments.\u201d\nBinding a value in bitcoin to the serial number of a banknote, in such a way as to permit the last bearer to redeem it, seems impossible to do in a watertight and decentralized way, but perhaps a central operator could implement a similar scheme.\n Lerner\u2019s solution is simpler: \u201c[If] we transfer some BTC to a [unspendable] output which describes the banknote (e.g. country, denomination and serial number), we could bind the BTC to the banknote forever, as long as people believe the banknote represents those \u2018destroyed\u2019 BTC,\u201d he said. \u201c[For] the system to work, everyone must agree that those BitBanknotes really hold the BTC value. But you can count on me: I would agree! Why not?\u201d\nLerner\u2019s own project to develop physical bitcoins, dubbed \u201cFirmcoin,\u201d seems to have disappeared. But it\u2019s plausible that new implementations of untraceable electronic cash, powered by strong cryptography and NFC-enabled smartphone apps, could resurface at any time to pose a very strong challenge to state monopolies and regulators.\n\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 4}

These are considered to be important steps toward the standardization of the Lightning Network\u2019s second-level, off-chain payment layer. The three teams, and others in the Bitcoin community, developed the Lightning specification through an open, collaborative process.\"Interoperability is key to making Lightning a success. We have worked for over a year to design a specification so that we and other developers can write implementations that talk to each other,\u201d Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThis ensures that no matter which implementation a user is using, they will be connected to one Lightning Network.\u201d\u201cIt's the culmination of a year's work on the protocol specification, and the tests show that we have built a solid protocol that delivers on the promises of high scalability, increased privacy, and faster payments,\" Christian Decker, a Blockstream infrastructure tech engineer, told Bitcoin Magazine.In parallel with protocol development work focused on interoperability and cross-compatibility, each of the three teams also developed specific Lightning implementations: ACINQ developed eclair, Blockstream developed c-lightning, and Lightning Labs developed lnd.In a first test, the coffee shop Starblocks, a sample eclair application, accepted an incoming payment in bitcoin from a customer paying with the lnd Lightning app, routed through c-lightning. In a second test, the developers made a payment from eclair to yalls.org, a sample lnd application, routed through c-lightning. \u201cThis highlights another anticipated use case for Lightning: the ability to send instant, small value payments,\u201d noted the three companies. The tests used nodes distributed around the world, including Asia, Europe, South America and North America.It seems plausible that these and other interoperable Lightning Network implementations could be, one day, operational on the Bitcoin blockchain, but the developers are cautious about committing to a specific timeline.\u201cOur next steps are to continue testing and work as quickly as we can toward a mainnet beta, where users will be able to use small amounts on the Bitcoin mainnet,\u201d Stark told Bitcoin Magazine. Decker\u2019s focus will be on the completion of the clients and individual releases \u201cas quickly and safely as possible.\u201d He emphasized that taking a patient approach and focusing on security is key. \"We don't make any promises besides. We do not release immature software out of respect for our user's funds.\"The Lightning Network is an overlay network built on top of an existing blockchain, in this case the Bitcoin blockchain. Similar to how the internet is built in layers, Lightning Network implementations create a new off-chain, high-throughput layer to channel near-instant payments. Interoperability will enable a single Lightning Network where payments are seamlessly routed without being isolated or incompatible. Limited scalability is one of the main problems plaguing current Bitcoin technology. In fact, the current Bitcoin blockchain can only process a few transactions per second, far below the thousands of transactions per second processed by the main credit card payment networks. Therefore, following the first Bitcoin Lightning Network white paper, published in February 2015, developers have been working on Lightning Network implementations to enable bitcoin scalability, efficient micropayments and near-instant transactions. This page on Github shows the latest integration test results for the three Lightning implementations.\u201cAs we move towards a final 1.0 version of the specification, we invite the broader community to provide peer review and feedback,\u201d concludes the announcement. \u201cWe look forward to continue working together to build the future of Layer 2 scalability technology.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 6}

Erik is interested in middlemen-less economics, and is a managing partner at Tapas Capital.\nOn December 5th, 2017, the Mission Bay Conference Center in San Francisco hosted cryptocurrency enthusiasts in suits, hoodies and everything in between. Token Summit II, presented by William Mougayar, author of \u201cThe Business Blockchain,\u201d and Nick Tomaino, founder of 1confirmation, was a hub for cohesion and problem-solving in the blockchain space. Experts gathered from every corner of the industry to discuss government regulation, cryptocurrency initiatives and the future of blockchain technology.Here are some of the highlights from the conference.Regulation Trials and TribulationsNancy Wojtas, partner at Cooley; Kathryn Haun, board member at Coinbase; Stan Miroshnik, CEO and managing director at Element; and Lowell Ness, partner at Perkins Coie, demystified and further debated looming government regulation (and lack thereof).Common questions that echoed throughout the panel: Which regulatory agency should investors focus on? Are tokens securities? Will there be new regulation or does existing regulation suffice?Haun believes that \u201cpeople in the ICO space are myopically focused on the SEC.\u201d Although the SEC has already issued guidance and issued emergency action, there is an \u201calphabet soup\u201d of other agencies that could issue further regulation. Federal and state regulatory agencies such as the DOJ could also intervene \u2013\u2013 which could involve prison time for breaking the law. Wojtas, on the other hand, explained her perception that because the SEC is leading the charge, other agencies are taking a backseat. She speculated that \u201c[people] are free to continue to do what we are doing,\u201d while being sensitive to all regulations.The short answer from the entire panel on whether or not tokens should count as securities: the government hasn\u2019t figured it out yet. They agreed that until the government sets a precedent in court, there is no clear answer.A utopian scenario in terms of regulating the industry as a whole would entail new regulatory schemes that specialize in blockchain technology and tokenization. The panelists suggested that there is a low likelihood for new regulation in the United States but that investors might see clarity once there is a body of cases that grows from tokens challenging the government in court or vice versa.Token Transparency and ICO InsightsMessari, a new transparency and disclosures project, shared their vision to become the open source data library for the universe of crypto assets \u2013\u2013 an SEC EDGAR-like solution for consumer protection. Ryan Selkis, founder of the Messari project, summarized the crux of cryptocurrency: Quasi-fiduciaries are selling quasi-securities, and there is no gold standard for disclosure. By creating an open data library, Messari hopes to serve all people: consumers, investors, lawyers and beyond. The team is committed to neutrality, working with regulatory standards bodies and cryptocurrency projects on a global scale to provide a free, open-source database. Crypto Valley > Silicon Valley?Oliver Bussmann, President of the Crypto Valley Association, utilized his panel time to entice potential cryptocurrency token founders to consider the Crypto Valley (Zug, Switzerland) as the ultimate location to launch their venture. The Valley is leveraging Switzerland\u2019s deep-rooted culture of privacy protection, confidentiality and legal certainty to become one of the fastest-growing global ecosystems. It boasts over 500 total members and an increase of 30 members per month. It\u2019s no surprise that Crypto Valley churns out cryptocurrencies like clockwork. The Valley has produced 10+ large scale Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) with 40+ in the process and 170+ in the pipeline.In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Bussmann explained that unlike other ecosystems, such as Silicon Valley, entrepreneurs can expect to find every possible resource necessary for a successful token launch within a 30-mile radius of Crypto Valley. \u201cWe have advisors helping with value proposition and token economy, seasoned legal experts, tax experts, accounting experts, people specialized in global marketing and global communications PR, secure ICO launch platforms, independent audit firms, smart contract audits, KYC, AML utilities and a community of investors looking to support the product.\u201dThe Future of CryptocurrencyNaval Ravikant, founder of AngelList, shared his thoughts about the current state of cryptocurrency. In his opinion, cryptocurrency seems to be going mainstream faster than expected. He cited factors such as \u201csavings accounts returning nothing and federal reserves returning nothing\u201d as motivators that investors might have for entering the cryptocurrency market. He also attributed the massive increase in market capitalization to the cryptocurrencies\u2019 ability to \u201cabsorb infinite speculative money.\u201d However, Ravikant believes that a regulation-free grace period is still necessary for cryptocurrencies to develop properly.When asked where he hypothesizes cryptocurrencies are in terms of bubble status, Ravikant replied that money can be a bubble that doesn\u2019t pop and that he isn\u2019t sure about the severity of the cryptocurrency bubble. As he explained, \u201cIf we all agree that something has value, it does.\u201d In regards to government regulation, Ravikant\u2019s answer was straight to the point: \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of when the government will get blockchain, but how.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 6}

Once the partnership is finalized, Hut 8 will control what they believe to be the largest cryptocurrency mining farm in North America: Hut 8 will gain immediate control over 22 bitcoin mining datacenters spread across Alberta. The expectation is for Hut 8 to be listed on the Canadian stock exchange during Q1 of 2018 and increasing control over an additional 35 datacenters. Hut 8 anticipates that through a combination of existing Bitfury sites and new installations, they will scale to 60 or more datacenters during 2018. The datacenters will be comprised of Bitfury\u2019s containerized bitcoin mining units called Blockboxes, containing Bitfury\u2019s 16nm ASIC chip, which they claim is one of the most efficient on the market.

{"title": "Quant Network Launches Overledger for Cross-Blockchain Data Interoperability", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/quant-network-launches-overledger-cross-blockchain-data-interoperability/", "birthday": "Dec 7, 2017  10:00 AM EST", "date": "2017-12-07 15:00:00", "content": "Last month, science and technology magazine New Scientist covered the Overledger project in a story titled, \u201cThe Blockchain to Fix All Blockchains.\u201d The story emphasizes the need for data interoperability technology across different blockchains that could play a role similar to TCP/IP, which enabled the internet to thrive.\u201c[Overledger] seems to be a straightforward extension of the original atomic swap idea,\u201d said Cornell University cryptocurrency expert Emin Gun Sirer, as reported by New Scientist. But instead of only supporting currencies as atomic swaps do, the Overledger works for any data that can be put on the blockchain.The Quant Overledger project is just coming out of stealth mode. In conversation with Bitcoin Magazine Gilbert Verdian, CEO and co-founder of Quant Network, confirmed that a patent for Overledger technology was filed in the first week of December.\"The uniqueness of our operating system is that Overledger is not another blockchain,\u201d Quant Chief Strategist and Executive Director of the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technology at University College London, Paolo Tasca, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe do not impose new consensus mechanisms, new gateways, adapters or special validating nodes on top of existing blockchains. Overledger is a virtual blockchain that links existing blockchains and allows developers to build multi-chain applications (or in other terms blockchain-agnostic applications).\"According to Verdian, blockchain technology needs to enable next generation applications to function across multiple blockchains, not be limited to any single a vendor or technology and allow seamless communication across multiple blockchains as well as recognition of transactions and assets across blockchains.As such, Quant is focussing on three goals: developing an API to connect the world\u2019s networks to multiple blockchains; bridging existing networks (e.g financial services) to new blockchains; and developing a new Blockchain Operating System with a protocol and a platform to create next-generation, multi-chain applications.Promoting the Blockchain ISO StandardVerdian initiated the development of Blockchain ISO Standard TC 307, which will allow for interoperability, governance and reference architecture of blockchain technologies to work between blockchains as well as allowing blockchain networks to interoperate with existing systems and networks in use today. Currently, there are 40 countries and organizations, such as the European Commission, working on developing the Blockchain ISO Standard, and the timeline is to have a published Standard in 2020, Verdian explained.\u201cEstablishing blockchain standards will position ISO as a leading contributor to develop global solutions to facilitate data movement and information flows, thus enabling more efficient and timely transactions,\u201d Verdian told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThere is no one blockchain standard or protocol currently in use. International standards will allow for interoperability and implementation and use of multiple blockchain-related protocols.\u201d\u201cQuant Overledger will be compatible to the Blockchain ISO Standard when it is released, allowing a gateway to \u2018talk\u2019 a common language to other networks and existing systems such as financial services networks,\u201d continued Verdian. \u201cThe entry and exit points of Overledger will be compatible to the ISO Standard, which any other technology vendor can also implement in future.\u201dBenefits of InteroperabilityVerdian added that the widespread adoption and use of international blockchain standards could facilitate a new wave of innovation, productivity, employment and industry opportunities. For example, the growing burden of KYC compliance could be reduced through the development of international blockchain standards which utilize shared databases for undertaking business and transacting payments. The development of international standards to support smart contracts has the potential to decrease contracting, compliance and enforcement provision costs. Similarly, the development of international blockchain standards could reduce transaction costs for SMEs when dealing with governments and businesses.\u201cQuant will completely change how people will be able to interact with blockchains in a way that\u2019s not possible today,\u201d concluded Verdian. \u201cA good example is the recognition of a person\u2019s identity by one entity on a blockchain will be recognized and understood by every other blockchain and every entity connected to those.\u201dDapp DevelopmentThere are plans for a Quant App Store that will allow developers and startups to create multi-chain applications on top of Overledger and monetize their applications in unique ways, without having to rely on capabilities of only one blockchain.\u201cAs a company, we\u2019re also planning to release distributed applications on top of Quant in the areas of RegTech, FinTech and HealthTech,\u201d Verdian told Bitcoin Magazine, adding by allowing businesses to directly interact with multiple blockchains, they will be better able to cope with the modern supply chain complexities.In a pre-ICO (Initial Coin Offering) in January, followed by an ICO in February, Quant will sell Quant Tokens that will allow users to access the Quant network. Developers will be able to publish distributed apps on the Quant store and optionally monetize their apps by charging usage fees in Quant Tokens, for example.Quant plans to release the first versions of Overledger in Q1 2018 and finalize the SDK and libraries in Q3 2018. This will be an open source and freely available software release that developers and enterprises will be able to use for creating next generation multi-chain applications. Then, Quant plans to release the Quant App Store at the end of 2018 for developers to publish their apps and earn Quant tokens.Image courtesy of Quant Project\u00a0", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 7}

After years of analyzing alternative investment funds, he uses his JD and MBA to analyze regulatory and investment trends on new, alternative, and illiquid asset classes. You can follow Andrew on Twitter @Andrew_M_Nelson\nThe utility aspect of Bitcoin faced a setback yesterday as PC gamers heard from Valve Corporation\u2019s Steam Team in a blog post that Bitcoin would no longer be accepted as payment on its digital distribution platform, Steam. Citing the volatility of the currency as well as the rising cost of fees, a representative of The Steam Team, known as \u201ckurtis\u201d, explained that the volatility of Bitcoin has created a problem for users trying to purchases games using the currency. Kurtis pointed out that:The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn\u2019t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.\n\n \nKurtis further elaborated that the normal resolution mechanism on Steam is either to refund the original payment to the user, which would negate the transaction or to ask the user to transfer additional funds to cover the remaining balance. \u201cIn both these cases, the user is hit with the Bitcoin network transaction fee again.\u201d Bitcoin was adopted as a means of payment via \u00a0bitcoin payment processor, BitPay, for games on Steam on April 27, 2016.\n\nSome users commenting on the blog seem to agree and support Valve\u2019s decision, with many calling for utilization of alternative cryptos such as Vertcoin, IOTA, and Litecoin. Others, such as one user named \u201cKaj Jez\u201d, stated,\n\nMassively disappointing. The first purchase I ever made in Bitcoin was on Steam. As long as Steam doesn't accept BTC I will prefer to do business with devs' own stores that hopefully do\u2026But as Bitcoin will undoubtedly improve itself with scalability solutions so to will Steam hopefully improve itself by rectifying this mistake and once again accepting it.\nSteam, the largest digital distribution platform for PC Games, has an active user base of over 275 million users with an average of 11 games per user, according to Sergey Galyonkin\u2019s Steam Spy API. In a Medium article, Galyonkin elaborated that 2016 sales for PC games through the Steam Platform totaled roughly $3.47 billion dollars. While it is unclear how much of that revenue resulted from bitcoin transactions during its period of acceptance, it is clear that the PC gaming community faced a major setback in utilizing Bitcoin as a means for buying games.\n\n \nAt the time of this writing, neither BitPay nor Steam nor Valve Corp could be reached for additional comment.", "year": 2017, "month": 12, "day": 7}

He described major changes in Ethereum\u2019s architecture that are likely to be implemented over the next few years to improve Ethereum in terms of privacy, safety (consensus safety and smart contract safety) and, of course, scalability, which was the main focus of Buterin\u2019s talk.Buterin doesn\u2019t seem worried about competitors. \u201cThe Ethereum killer is Ethereum, the Ethereum of China is Ethereum, the Ethereum of Taiwan is Ethereum\u2026 2.0,\u201d he said.The fact that Ethereum is booming seems to confirm Buterin\u2019s optimism. ETH\u2019s price has been relentlessly climbing, recently reaching almost $500, and Ethereum is handling more transactions than all other major blockchains combined.Decentralization, scalability and security are among the important properties that blockchain systems should have, but there are conflicts. Off-chain solutions are useful, but limited. According to Buterin, it\u2019s very easy to have two of these properties but very hard to have all three. However, Ethereum\u2019s ambitious goal should be that of achieving all three at the same time. \u201cWe want to scale to thousands of transactions per second, on chain, without any supernodes,\u201d reads one of Buterin\u2019s slides.ShardingSharding \u2014 dividing a blockchain network into several smaller component networks (called shards) capable of processing transactions in parallel \u2014 is considered to be a promising way to achieve high throughputs comparable to the thousands of transactions per second of traditional payment networks such as Visa and MasterCard. \u201cYou can think of [sharding] as, in a fairly simple version, creating a blockchain where you have, let\u2019s say, a hundred different universes, and each of these universes is a different account space,\u201d said Buterin. \u201cSo you can have an account in some universe or you can have a contract in some universe and you can send a transaction in some universe, and if you send a transaction in some universe it only affects stuff in some universe.\u201cBut these kind of 100 universes are not just separate blockchains; they are systems that are also interconnected with each other,\u201d continued Buterin. \u201cParticularly, they share consensus. So in order to break even one of them, you have to break the whole thing.\u201dButerin went on to describe relatively easy and more sophisticated ways to implement sharding in the Ethereum blockchain, outlining a sharding roadmap that foresees, at least initially, the creation of new \u201cuniverses\u201d that don\u2019t impact the main chain while permitting iterative experimentation, such as introducing higher levels of scalability, starting with \u201cquadratic scalability as nodes validate certain shards and act as light clients for other shards.\u201dPrivacyButerin noted that zero-knowledge proof (zk-Snarks) privacy technology equivalent to Zcash has been implemented in the recent \u201cByzantium\u201d Ethereum upgrade, offering application developers new ways to implement tighter privacy. These new privacy tools will permit showing transactions to specific parties while hiding them from public view. Buterin went as far as saying that the privacy problem is now three quarters of the way to being solved.Proof of Work vs. Proof of StakeA major upgrade to Ethereum will be the introduction of Proof of Stake (PoS) in Casper which, according to Buterin, might be ready by next summer. With the first release of Casper, Ethereum will transition from pure Proof of Work (PoW) to hybrid PoW/PoS. \u201cIn this scheme, all of the proof-of-work mechanics will continue to exist, but additional proof-of-stake mechanics will be added,\u201d noted Buterin.The main reason why PoS is seen as a necessary development is, of course, the need to reduce the energy requirements of PoW blockchains like the current versions of Ethereum and Bitcoin. A recent report claims that Bitcoin mining consumes as much power in a year as 159 countries, which is clearly far too much, and Buterin admitted that today\u2019s Ethereum isn\u2019t any better than Bitcoin in that respect.Smart Contract SecuritySmart contracts implemented with Turing-complete programming languages are arguably the main innovation introduced by Ethereum. While smart contracts are finding countless applications and moving lots of money, the security and safety of Ethereum smart contracts have been questioned. Buterin confirmed that Ethereum will eventually introduce formal verification for smart contracts and that a new Python-like smart-contract programming language \u2014 dubbed \u201cViper\u201d \u2014 is being implemented to enable the development of safer Ethereum applications.While Buterin hasn\u2019t said anything that he has not said in previous talks and papers, his BeyondBlock talk served as a useful confirmation and summary of the ambitious Ethereum development roadmap.Besides Buterin\u2019s talk, all the talks given at BeyondBlock Taipei 2017 are included in the full video recordings of the morning session and the afternoon session.", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 29}
{"title": "Op Ed: \u201cWe Never Thought of That\u201d \u2014 When Venture-Backed Companies Undertake Reverse ICOs", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-we-never-thought-when-venture-backed-companies-undertake-reverse-icos/", "birthday": "Nov 20, 2017 5:22 PM EST", "date": "2017-11-20 22:22:00", "content": "With well over $3 billion raised this year alone, in very little time initial coin offerings (ICOs) have emerged as a major source of venture finance. Even companies that have already raised conventional venture funding will be tempted to raise additional funds through ICOs. Although not fully intuitive, some have labeled token issuances by entities that previously obtained equity financing as \u201cReverse ICOs.\u201d\nOne prominent example of a Reverse ICO has already occurred. Recently, Kik Interactive successfully completed an ICO of nearly $100 million. With over $3 billion raised in ICOs this year alone, ICOs are not unsubstantial. What made the Kik offering far more unusual is that Kik has already raised over $100 million from venture investors. \nThe standard documents used for angel and venture investing predate the current ICO craze and, not surprisingly, do not expressly address ICOs. Understandably, these documents are all \u201cshare-centric.\u201d The question that needs to be addressed, therefore, is: What rights, if any, do existing investors have when their company elects to undertake an ICO? \nWhat makes the analysis particularly difficult is that, broadly speaking, there are three types of ICOs:\nEquity Tokens \u2014 these tokens are essentially digital shares with the issuer specifying equity participation, voting rights and other token/shareholder rights.Non-Equity Security Tokens \u2014 these tokens do not grant equity rights but under the Howey test are nonetheless classified as securities.Utility Tokens \u2014 these tokens allow the purchaser to buy products or services from the issuer.\nAlthough not the subject of this article, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued initial guidance with respect to the securities law status of tokens issued in ICOs. The SEC\u2019s Chief Accountant has also put out guidance detailing some of the accounting issues raised by ICOs. \nThis article will identify several issues raised by ICOs under commonly used SAFE, Convertible Note, Series Seed and Series A documents.\nWhy Existing Investors Might Object to Reverse ICOs\nOn the surface, Reverse ICOs would seem to be a net positive for existing investors. Except for equity tokens, ICOs provide non-dilutive financing to companies. Even when tokens are classified as securities, they generally are not issued as equity\u00a0\u00a0\u2014purchasers do not have a share in the issuer, do not receive dividends and do not get voting rights. However, there are several reasons why existing investors might be concerned:\nMultiple \u201cPlays\u201d on the Same Company \nAfter a Reverse ICO, a venture-backed company will have both tokens and equity in the hands of investors. Prior to the ICO, the only way an investor could invest in the company was by buying its stock. After the ICO, the investor would have a choice of buying the stock or buying tokens.\nAt least in the current environment, there is reason to believe that demand for tokens will be greater and drive up relative prices for tokens. Equity holders may find reduced demand for their equity. Further, if the tokens remain outstanding at the time of an exit, it is difficult to predict the impact of outstanding token pools on exit valuations in either an acquisition or IPO scenario. \nImpact on Follow-On Venture Funding \nMany venture funds make relatively small initial investments, anticipating that they will deploy significantly more capital in subsequent rounds. ICOs may reduce companies\u2019 needs for future equity raises. As a result, venture funds may have reduced opportunities for follow-on funding.\nDelay or Elimination of Conversion Events \nFor holders of Convertible Notes and SAFEs, under most currently used form documents, ICOs typically will not be considered an event that triggers a conversion. In some cases, ICOs may also delay or even eliminate subsequent equity financings. Further, in successful companies, ICOs often will raise the pre-money valuation at which conversion occurs, thereby diluting SAFE/Note holders (although conversion caps in many of these instruments may mitigate the impact).\nAvoiding Pre-Emptive Rights\nUnder the current agreement forms, tokens sold in an ICO would not trigger the pre-emptive rights of existing shareholders \u2014 thereby denying them an automatic right of participation in the ICO.\nAbsence of Transfer Restrictions\nUnder the current agreement forms, tokens sold in an ICO would not be subject to the rights of first refusal, co-sale rights and the transfer restrictions typically applicable to shareholders in venture-backed companies.\nICOs Do Not Trigger Other Typical Preferred Shareholder Provisions \nAnti-Dilution Protection. If a company underprices its tokens, its impact on valuation could be similar to a \u201cdown round.\u201d However, unless tokens are issued as equity, they would not trigger the anti-dilution protection clauses in the standard forms.Liquidation Preferences. If token holders are given equity participation in an issuer, the issuing documentation will need to specify where they stand in the liquidation stack. For utility tokens, if the claim against the company is viewed as contractual (i.e., the holders of a pre-payment for products/services), token holders may be unsecured creditors instead of shareholders \u2014 in which case they would rank ahead of all equity classes.Mandatory Conversion of Preferred Shares. Venture documents typically provide for mandatory conversion of preferred shares in an IPO of a specified minimum amount raised and minimum share price or approval by what is typically a supermajority of preferred shareholders. Several ICOs have raised in excess of $100 million. If these companies go public, it is possible that some may not need additional funding and may do so without a public offering of additional shares (i.e., a direct offering). However, if not all shareholders agree with the decision to go public, the mandatory conversion provision could not be utilized unless approved by a supermajority of the preferred shareholders, which in some circumstances could impede the ability of an IPO to proceed.\nImpact on Future Cash Flow\nMany ICO issuers are positioning their tokens as \u201cutility tokens\u201d that can be used in the future to buy the issuer\u2019s product or service. As a result, these tokens constitute pre-pays for the future delivery of goods and services. In the future, when the products/services need to be delivered, the venture may experience cash flow issues because no new funds will be coming in to pay for the product or service.\nImpact of Regulatory, Tax and Accounting Uncertainty \nCurrently, the regulatory status of ICOs is unclear. Issuance of tokens in a manner that does not comply with the eventual regulations that emerge could create liabilities for the company and/or limit its ability to issue equity in the future. In addition, the accounting and tax rules for ICOs have not been established, and as a result, there may be ambiguity with respect to several representations and warranties the company typically will need to make in future financings and liquidity events.\nFiduciary Uncertainty\nOfficers and directors of companies have fiduciary obligations to maximize shareholder value. When companies are insolvent, these duties shift to protection of the interests of creditors. What, if any, fiduciary duties a board has with respect to token holders has not been explored. If a company is facing a decision that would benefit shareholders at a cost to token holders, do board members have any fiduciary obligation to the token holders? Investor representatives on boards of companies that have conducted Reverse ICOs will not only have to deal with uncertainty but also potential conflicts of interest if they have not participated in the Reverse ICO.\nCan Investors Prevent a Company from Undertaking an ICO?\nWhile it is difficult to believe that a company would undertake an ICO without board approval, in many early-stage companies, investors do not have control of the board. However, commonly used investment documents may leave shareholders with limited recourse where boards back an ICO. In general, in SAFEs and Convertible Notes, holders do not have protective rights and, as a result, they do not have the ability to prevent an ICO.\nThe protective provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation for Series Seed financings would not provide Series Seed holders with the ability to prevent an ICO. In the NVCA Series A documents, ICOs do not easily fit into any of the matters for which the investor director\u2019s approval is required. The same applies to the protective provisions for the benefit of preferred shareholders detailed in the Certificate of Incorporation.\nWhat Now?\nFor blockchain startups, ICOs have become the dominant form of fundraising \u2014 far exceeding venture capital financing. Given the strength of the ICO market, \u201cReverse ICOs\u201d are likely to become even more pervasive. For investors this could be very challenging. Existing form agreements in the venture space are likely to be revised to address the possibility of Reverse ICOs. However, the regulatory, tax and accounting uncertainties around ICOs may not be quickly resolved, leaving uncertainty around some of the concerns raised in this article.\nRevising the form agreements will not address the thousands of venture-backed companies that were financed using pre-ICO forms. For existing investors the path forward is more difficult. Where investors control the board or have blocking rights, they will have the ability to prevent ICOs or influence their terms. For other investors, particularly in early-stage ventures with founder-dominated boards, ICOs have the potential to overturn several assumptions under which early investors funded. These investors may have to wait for situations in which their approval is needed for unrelated corporate actions or their funding is necessary and leverage that position to insist upon amendments to existing investment documents to address some of the investor challenges resulting from Reverse ICOs.\n\nThis is a guest post by Dror Futter.

He attributes his love-hate relationship with Abercrombie & Fitch and inspiration for his writing to a unique blend of experiences in Russia, Hungary, Spain and the United States. Erik is interested in middlemen-less economics, and is a managing partner at Tapas Capital.\nThe Lambda Protocol has announced a decentralized, open-source solution for unrestricted access to decentralized applications (DApps). Utilizing the Lambda Protocol, DApp developers can leverage existing browsers such as Chrome or Safari to open up their applications to millions of devices currently being used. The Lambda Protocol plans to launch with support for both the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains, adding support for permissioned blockchains such as Hyperledger Fabric in the future.\nThe Lambda Protocol team, based in Singapore and Australia, is headed by CEO Taiyang Zhang. Team mentors include Santiment COO Dorjee Sun, KyberNetwork CEO Loi Luu and Liquidity.Network co-founder Arthur Gervais. \nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Zhang explained that there are two main problems when it comes to DApps: centralized access points and lack of interoperability between browsers and wallets.\nCurrently, most browsers for the decentralized web are centralized. For example, Google Chrome extensions and iOS applications allow users to access and interact with DApps on the Ethereum Network. These DApp browsers are controlled by private corporations, and they all share a common weakness: a single point of failure. They can easily be removed at a corporation\u2019s discretion, no questions asked. \nZhang compared this single point of failure to a hypothetical in which a portal to search the entire web is hosted on a single website. \n\nAll it takes is for an ISP/Government to block one website, which defeats a core premise of decentralization.\nAll decentralized applications require a cryptocurrency wallet to function. Because of this restrictive prerequisite, desktop users must either integrate a wallet into a browser such as Chrome or Firefox by installing an add-on or create a new wallet by installing a new browser. \nUsers seeking to access DApps on mobile devices face greater limitations. Native iOS and Android apps do not support third-party browser/extension embedding, and popular mobile web browsers such as Chrome and Safari do not support add-ons. \nThe Lambda Protocol \nThe Lambda Protocol is an open-source internet protocol. \"Our goal is to allow users to access the decentralized applications of the future in the browsers of today,\" said Zhang.\nTo facilitate this access to DApps, the Lambda Protocol plans to develop a decentralized messaging layer. This messaging layer has the capability to connect browsers such as Chrome and Safari to cryptocurrency wallets such as Ledger Nano S, Trezor, imToken and Jaxx. By utilizing the Lambda Protocol, DApp developers can open their applications to the millions of devices and applications that users currently use. \nConversely, users can connect to DApps via the Lambda decentralized protocol. For example, users can trade bitcoin on decentralized exchanges using hardware wallets without downloading additional software. And they can use decentralized applications on mobile devices without downloading additional applications. \nPreviously, it was impossible to access any DApps without downloading software that acts as a centralized point of access. But with the Lambda Protocol, users are offered a frictionless, decentralized entry point to the \u201cWeb 3.0.\u201d\nHow the Lambda Protocol Works\nDAP (Decentralized Application Particle) tokens fuel the Lambda Protocol. Zhang described the protocol\u2019s basic structure from three standpoints: developers, users and relayers:\n\u201cDevelopers utilizing the Lambda Protocol pay DAP tokens to request a user\u2019s wallet to sign a transaction. Users sign transactions, which are then broadcast to the network. Relayers (users who facilitate the execution of a transaction) earn DAP tokens by broadcasting and generating a proof.\u201d\nThe amount of DAP required for an individual transaction varies and is calculated dynamically. A staking and rate-limiting mechanism is employed to ensure developers are only charged for on-chain transactions.\nThe Lambda Protocol plans to launch its testnet in Q1 of 2018.", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 28}

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nTether, a cryptocurrency pegged 1-to-1 to the U.S. dollar, was allegedly hacked this week to the tune of $31 million.\nTether functions to convert U.S. dollars to a type of cryptocurrency. The project\u2019s token (USDT) is pegged to the dollar and is used in exchange trading. The idea behind Tether is that instead of having to sell your bitcoin or other token for a fiat currency, you can convert it to USDT, and either hold it in USDT or else transfer your USDT to another exchange and use it to purchase tokens there. \nAs for the exchanges, USDT allows them to trade in something akin to dollars, without requiring them to have a bank account. \nTether operates on the \u201cOmni Layer Protocol,\u201d which itself operates on top of the Bitcoin network, and uses Bitcoin addresses. According to a blog post on the project\u2019s website, $31 million worth of USDT was sent to an unauthorized Bitcoin address on November 19, 2017. \nIn the blog post, Tether also noted it released a new version of the Omni Core software used by exchanges and wallets to support USDT transactions, thus implementing a temporary hard fork to the Omni Layer. As a result, the affected tokens are frozen in place, making them essentially worthless to the hacker. \n\u201cWe strongly urge all Tether integrators to install this software immediately to prevent the coins from entering the ecosystem,\u201d Tether wrote, adding that \u201cany tokens from the attacker\u2019s addresses will not be redeemed.\u201d\nSome exchanges, like Kraken, have stopped trading USDT temporarily while they upgrade to the newer software. \nThe heist was made in three separate USDT transfers out of Tether\u2019s core Treasury wallet in the amounts of 23,000,000; 7,900,000; and 500,000 USDT. It is unclear why the hacker did not move all of the money out at once.\nIn addition to the other exchanges it trades on, USDT is widely traded on Bitfinex, an exchange that lost 119,756 BTC (worth $72 million at the time) in a hack that took place a year and a half ago. \nNews of the Tether attack comes at a time when some \u2014 notably the blogger \u201cBitfinex\u2019ed\u201d \u2014 are questioning whether USDTs are being issued without backing of actual U.S. dollars. Similarly, there has been growing speculation that Tether is being used in possible market manipulation to drive up the price of bitcoin.\nThe current market cap value of USDT is around $673 million. If that money is backed by real reserves, as Tether claims, the project would need to have at least that much in its bank account in Taiwan. \nTether publishes a bank account balance on its website\u2019s Transparency page, but in the legal section of its website, the company says it has no obligation to exchange USDT for dollars. \n\u201cThere is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money,\u201d Tether says.\nThe project\u2019s website has been up and down sporadically, since the hack. An archive of the site is available here. \n\n\nCorrection November 23, 2017: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated Tether would redeem tokens for fiat at anytime. Tether claims it is under no legal obligation to exchange tokens for fiat. A correction has been made to reflect this.", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 21}

He's spent years building products and solutions, all the while writing over 300 articles for various magazines covering software reviews, programming tips, interviews and music piracy.\nThe inventor of Bittorrent has now turned his attention to blockchain technology and building a greener Bitcoin called Chia. Bram Cohen released Bittorrent to the world in 2004, but, in early 2017, he stepped away from the company he built to focus on blockchain technology. A very technical paper was co-authored by Cohen and released in September 2017 titled \"Beyond Hellman's Time-Memory Trade-Offs with Applications to Proofs of Space,\" that covered \u201cProofs of Space\u201d as a blockchain consensus method. Then, in November 2017, Chia was announced to the world, with a presentation available and the associated slides covering the concepts they plan to develop.Engineering work has begun on the resurrected Proof of Space (PoSpace) protocol that makes use of empty space on your hardrive and adding another consensus algorithm, Proof of Time (PoT), to both get around problems with a pure PoSpace protocol, and the energy-consuming, heat-producing Proof of Work (PoW) performed by Bitcoin. Bitcoin is arguably the most secure and immutable computer network in the world, but this comes at a cost;\u00a0it is estimated that Bitcoin energy consumption is currently around 30 terawatt-hours per year. The average home in the U.S. consumes about 11 megawatt-hours per year, which works out to about 3 million homes worth of electricity consumption. Cohen plans to change all that by replacing proof-of-work miners with what he calls \u201cfarmers.\u201dSource:\u00a0https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumptionHow It Will WorkThe goal is to make a better bitcoin, fix the centralization problems, reduce the environmental impact and remove the instability that can happen when miners have an excessive amount of influence on mining operations from cheap electricity and massive mining operations.Chia is calling it \u201cfarming\u201d instead of \u201cmining\u201d because it is more environmentally friendly and there is no massive energy consumption or wasted heat. This model opens up the farming operation to anyone that has free disk space. In the PoSpace system, farmers will allocate unused disk space to the network. The chances of successfully mining a block are going to be proportional to the amount of space allocated divided by the total capacity of the network. With a 4TB hard drive going for as little as $100 these days, it will even be simple and inexpensive to create a dedicated Chia farm.According to Cohen's presentation on Chia, they have solved various problems with PoSpace, including grinding attacks, by adding PoT and alternating between them. To quote from his presentation on both: \"When a new block is minted, it propagates rapidly to all full nodes and farmers start working on top of it. When a farmer finds a new block, they publish it to the network. \u201cFarmers all find the best proof of space they have and the three best proofs of space propagate through the whole network, and proofs-of-time servers start working on top of them. When a proof-of-time server finishes the proof of time for a proof of space, it publishes the whole thing as a fully validated block and publishes it to the network to be built on top of again. Each block starts with a proof of space and is finalized with a proof of time.\"There is only a small number of PoT servers running currently, and, if two people are running the same PoT on something, they will get the same answer. Since there is no direct incentive in the protocol for doing proofs of time, and the only way to process more PoSpace transactions would be to coordinate with PoSpace farmers, the system is less prone to abuse and centralization of power. Furthermore, they contend that PoSpace is made to be non-outsourceable, so when trying to run a mining pool, if a device in the pool wins the block, that device/owner can only keep it for themselves and not give it to the pool. How this works in practice is not clear at this stage.PoSpace is ASIC resistant, with disc space so cheap and prevalent now; however, PoT could certainly be optimized in hardware with specialized chips. Unlike PoW though, a PoT chip has many potential uses outside of farming cryptocurrency. Even if PoT servers remain scarce and centralized so that they always win the block, they are acting as part of the entire ecosystem, not controlling it. Conceptually, this brings a lot of democracy back to the generation of blockchain blocks.Chia has raised an undisclosed amount of money to get started and are currently looking to hire software developers to accelerate the development of Chia with the intent of releasing in 2018. After the release, the goal for Chia is to eventually implement the Lightning Network for more efficient transactions.\n\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 29}

How Formal Verification Could Fortify Smart Contracts", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/goodbye-bugs-how-formal-verification-could-fortify-smart-contracts/", "birthday": "Nov 22, 2017  10:25 AM EST", "date": "2017-11-22 15:25:00", "content": "Amy Castor is a full-time freelance writer and researcher who enthusiastically follows Bitcoin and Ethereum. She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nAs a way to eliminate bugs in high-risk code, a style of software programming known as formal verification is making its way into the blockchain world.Put simply, formal verification uses math to specify and analyze a program for errors in logic. However, because of the time and cost involved, formal verification is best reserved for situations where human life or large sums of money are at stake.Currently, formal verification is used to verify the correctness of high-risk code in transportation, the military and cryptography. Chip companies use it to fortify algorithms before embedding them in silicon. And banks use it to develop financial algorithms. Applied to blockchain technology, formal verification could provide assurances that self-executing transactions known as smart contracts will work as intended, eliminating some of the bugs and financial losses that come as a result of coding errors. This year alone, bugs in Ethereum\u2019s Parity wallet accounted for $180 million in losses. Last year, a bug in a virtual organization known as The DAO enabled a hacker to siphon $50 million from the Ethereum smart contract. \u00a0Platforms like Cardano and Tezos are already working on smart contract languages specifically designed to facilitate formal verification. Ethereum is also working on bringing formal verification to its smart contracts. But what is formal verification? How does it work? And why is software so difficult to get right in the first place?To Err Is Human Software is inherently unforgiving. If you are constructing a building, you can leave out a nail or a screw, and the structure still stands. But when it comes to software, something as simple as a single typo can cause the entire program to stop working. \u201cProgramming languages are incredibly powerful,\u201d Gerard Holzmann, former lead scientist at NASA, explained in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAs a programmer, you have to deal with a lot of detail, and unless you get every detail right, there is some effect.\u201d \u00a0The traditional approach to getting software right is testing. After you write an algorithm, you input a variable and check to see if it gives back the correct output. But how do you test every single input? You can\u2019t. There are too many to test, and there could be errors lurking in the cases that you do not test. \u201cThere are so many possible executions that really, when you test or execute, you just scratch the surface of what is possible,\u201d Holzmann said.Put another way, testing only looks for the presence of bugs, not the absence of bugs, and one small mistake could have devastating results. \u00a0\u201cIf you take any failure of a system, like Fukushima and Three Mile Island, and look at the sequence of events that led to that failure, it is always fascinating because there are so many things that nobody could have predicted that would happen in a particular accommodation,\u201d said Holzmann. \u201cSame as in software; so many things can happen.\u201dIn contrast, instead of testing one situation at a time, formal verification is a way to test that a program works in every situation. What you care about is whether the logic holds true, and the best way to check that logic is with a computer. \u00a0\u201cA formalism for me has the purpose that you can reason about things, and the most useful way of reasoning about things is if you can program a machine to do the reasoning for you,\u201d said Holzmann.Making a PlanGenerally, the first step in formal verification is to create a mathematical model. The math needed is not complicated; it\u2019s just basic logic written up in a so-called \u201cformal language\u201d that is machine checkable. \u00a0Typically, the process of specifying a model begins with a stakeholder who understands what the system needs to do. In the case of a medical device, the stakeholder might be a doctor; in the case of a smart contract, it might be a lawyer or a banker, or both.The job of a stakeholder is to convey the information in her head to a requirements engineer who collects that information and creates the model. The process begins informally with discussions and abstractions, but ends formally with a precise mathematical specification.This is not easy. It is a time consuming, iterative process that can take months, depending on the situation, but it often brings a clarity to a situation that was not there before because it forces programmers to think deeply about the behavior of a software. \u201cYou can think of it as laws and regulations,\u201d said Andreas Zeller, professor of software engineering at Saarland University in Saarbruecken, Germany, who likens creating a formal specification to developing a plan for a building.\u201cYou refine the regulations,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBut if you do not have regulations in the first place, your building crashes, and that is when you realize, you had better make a plan.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Checking the LogicOnce a model is specified, the next step is to verify the model\u2019s logic with proofs. This is a critical step in the process. \u201cIf you do not have a proof, you do not have a guarantee that the model, as it is, will work,\u201d explained Zeller. But because you have to make explicit every single logical step, proofs can be immensely long and complex. In the past, this made formal verification agonizingly difficult. Even the simplest statement could require dozens of theorems and lemmas. Fortunately, these days, many formal systems use automated theorem provers, like Coq, Isabelle or Metamath, that can check or even partially construct a formal proof.Once a model is proven to work, the next step is building your program. But you still must make sure the software you build conforms to the specification. \u00a0This is where functional programming languages like ML, Haskell, OCaml or F# enter into the picture. Because these languages are closer to algebra in their expressiveness, they are a better match for formal verification than languages like C, Java, or JavaScript. For this reason, Tezos is written in OCaml and Cardano is written in Haskell, so changes to the protocol are easier to formally verify. (A formal specification for Ouroboros Praos, the next generation of the consensus algorithm powering Cardano, is already in the works.) Similarly, Tezos\u2019 smart contract language Michelson is based on OCaml; Cardano\u2019s smart contract language Plutus is based on Haskell. Pros and Cons On the plus side, formal verification allows computer scientists greater assurances in developing software. On the negative side, because of the rigor involved, formal methods can be a time-consuming, costly undertaking for projects developing the code. Because of this, formal methods are best used to guarantee smaller building blocks of code that get reused over and over. You would not use it for, say, an entire operating system, but only those parts of a system that require the highest safety or security assurances. \u00a0Naturally, any type of security comes at a cost. The question is, how much security will blockchain and smart contract developers be willing to pay for? If you want something that is error free, \u201cyou had better be prepared to spend tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars for people who will provide a full proof,\u201d cautioned Zeller. \u00a0On the other hand, for smart contracts securing tens of millions of dollars in funds, those costs may be well worth it. Looking at it another way, in a competitive environment, formal verification could make smart contracts more appealing to the consumer. If, for instance, you had the choice of entrusting your funds to a smart contract that had been formally verified versus one that has not, which one would you choose? \u00a0___________Thanks to Tim Menzies, professor of computer science at North Carolina University, and Brighten Godfrey, co-founder and CTO at Veriflow, and Automated Software Engineering 2017.

In May, SAP itself launched its innovation system, dubbed SAP Leonardo, focused on next-generation technologies, with an SAP Cloud Platform Blockchain service targeted at all industries, including but not limited to popular use cases in financial services and supply chains. SAP\u2019s blockchain technology platform allows customers and developers to build blockchain extensions for existing applications and integrate SAP solutions in the blockchain ecosystem. Embedded in the SAP Cloud Platform, SAP\u2019s blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) pilot allows customers to experiment with the technology.SAP is also envisaging the integration of blockchain technology with other next-generation technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). In September, SAP announced a blockchain co-innovation initiative and plans to make blockchain technology an integrated part of IoT, manufacturing and digital supply chain solutions using its Cloud Platform Blockchain service.\u201cPrior to defining the strategy and approach for SophiaTX, we assessed the technological capabilities of other blockchains to ensure we were truly adding value,\u201d\u00a0Jaroslav Kacina, CEO of Equidato and SophiaTX,\u00a0\u00a0told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe wanted to create a product that will not only be suitable for business but also provide superior functionality and features. We found that very few of the existing blockchains are focused on business and enterprise applications, and we couldn\u2019t identify any that would be suitable for business from compliance, security and architecture perspective.\u201dKacina explained that Ethereum, for example, is probably the most dominant platform for initial coin offerings (ICOs) and token generation events (TGEs), but in his view, Ethereum\u2019s use of proof of work makes it inappropriate for providing secure, holistic, high-performance blockchain solutions. \u201cOn the other hand, SAP\u2019s own Leonardo initiative, Blockchain as a Service (BaaS), is shaped as a private solution and therefore tends to be relatively expensive for smaller businesses, as well as less transparent, since it is cloud based,\u201d Kacina added. \u201cWe designed SophiaTX with business use in mind so it is compliant, secure and public, therefore allowing businesses and customers across entire the value chain to join and adopt the use of the platform.\u201dBased on the same proprietary technology as the DECENT blockchain, SophiaTX was created by Equidato Technologies AG, a joint venture between DECENT on the technology side and the Venaco Group bringing its experience in enterprise applications for business to the project.\u201cWe have decided to use DECENT technology due to the fact that DECENT uses DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) which is faster than Proof of Work used by Ethereum and Bitcoin,\u201d Kacina explained. \u201cWe needed a platform which is suitable as a starting point to create additional features to make it compliant, secure and relevant for business. And also, having access to [the] DECENT team\u2019s capabilities allows us to bring [the] product to market in [an] accelerated fashion. The \u2018hard fork\u2019 was created as a copy of the DECENT\u2019s main net and installed as a proprietary solution for SophiaTX.\u201dA proof of concept (PoC), recently demonstrated to a select group of attendees in Zurich, shows how businesses can use blockchain technology to transparently and reliably exchange information between their enterprise systems in real time, with a customer invoice directly created in one SAP system automatically transferred via the SophaTX testnet to another company using a different SAP system.SophiaTX wants to be a cross-industry platform allowing both vertical and horizontal integrations for businesses of all sizes. \u201cAt the initiation of this project, we analyzed all standard modules of typical ERP systems (SAP) across finance, procurement, logistics, sales, manufacturing and others, and we have identified over 15 specific use cases within several industries,\u201d Kacina told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt became apparent to us that, in order to adopt blockchain [technology] into various industries and connect to the enterprise applications, we needed to provide common building blocks across all modules of ERP, SCM and CRM systems. This led us to the concept of establishing a platform, as a key infrastructure for peer-to-peer smart transactions, prior to building industry specific solutions.\u201dKacina explained that different types of cross-industry scenarios have been worked out. For example, one-to-one document exchange could be used by any industry needing to acknowledge the transaction of invoices, purchase orders, delivery notices and other documents, while multiparty-information exchange is especially relevant for projects or systems with multiple vendors, contractors or collaborating firms. As an industry-specific example, SophiaTX wants to enable a \u201ctrack and trace\u201d solution across value chains, allowing supply chain transparency and security, which is considered as being of particular interest to the food, pharmaceutical and luxury markets.The proprietary SophiaTX token, SPHTX, will fuel the SophiaTX blockchain. The SophiaTX token sale will last for 10 days with a hard cap of 115,000 ETH and fund the development, marketing and ongoing management of the project and the overall SophiaTX platform. Kacina explained that the token will grant rights to use and transact using the platform, thus rewarding miners validating transactions and blocks on the chain.The SPHTX token will also allow access to the development platform and facilitate the licensing for private blockchains. Finally, the SPHTX token will permit using the marketplace, a web-based entry point for customers and solution developers, which will feature an App Store and a Dev Store.\u201cThe SophiaTX marketplace will be used by both industrial companies and a global community of experts, consultants and developers,\u201d Kacina told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt will be specifically designed to not only share applications and assets, but also to exchange know-how, process maps and blueprints, integration strategies, and to offer professional consulting services to encourage accelerated adoption and use of the platform. A developer, for example, could publish an app in the marketplace which would be accessible to businesses, as well as the end-user community, [that] use applications that integrate with their existing systems.

The miner \u2014 its name references the Dragons' Den, an (in)famous private chat channel on the Bitcoin Core Community Slack \u2014 is said to be equipped with newly designed chips and can produce a total of 16 terahashes per second. Importantly, BtcDrak claims that the machines are about 30 percent more energy efficient than the most efficient ASIC miner on the market right now, Bitmain\u2019s AntMiner S9. \u201cThe DragonMint will be the most advanced miner to date,\u201d he said.The main bottleneck to entering the ASIC market is typically capital: developing specialized chips from scratch is expensive. While BtcDrak preferred not to disclose much information about Halong Mining for now, he did note that the machines have been produced by a team with \u201cserious expertise.\u201d According to the developer, Halong Mining has invested $30 million in research and development so far, with over 100 people involved, including chip designers, electronics hardware specialists and software designers. \u201cResearch and development is not cheap, and we need a lot of diverse skills,\u201d BtcDrak explained.Halong Mining has now produced a prototype batch of DragonMint machines for testing and fine-tuning,\u00a0BtcDrak said, but\u00a0these\u00a0will not be sold to the public due to risk of reverse engineering. He\u00a0emphasized that the machines are working, however, adding:\u201cOther companies that want to enter the ASIC mining industry develop everything in simulations, and then the first presale batch tries to pay for small production. But the NRE [non-recurring engineering] and making wafers is fraught with difficulty; the first run is not easy to do well.\u201dHalong Mining published a video of a DragonMint on YouTube today. BtcDrak thinks the first mass-produced run of DragonMint miners will happen within about four months and begin to ship in March of 2018. Apart from the DragonMint machines, he says Halong Mining will also be selling mining chips separately, in bulk.The CompetitionWith the introduction of DragonMint miners, Halong Mining should offer an alternative for Bitmain\u2019s mining hardware, which has dominated the market for the past few years. An estimated 70 percent or more of the hash power on the network today is produced by Bitmain machines, and around half of all hash power is pointed to mining pools that are either owned by or closely affiliated with Bitmain, such as AntPool, BTC.com, ConnectBTC and ViaBTC.\u201cOne manufacturer as a monopoly is not good for Bitcoin,\u201d BtcDrak said. \u201cCentralization in mining is a problem regardless of how benevolent you are. If there is a center, then governments and criminals can attack it. Decentralization protects the entire system and all its participants. So I wanted to bring competition.\u201d Bitmain in particular has also not made itself popular within segments of the Bitcoin community over the past years. The Chinese ASIC manufacturer was at the center of the AsicBoost and Antbleed controversies. And perhaps more importantly, some speculate that the company exerted its influence over the mining ecosystem by allowing or limiting hardware sales based on how hash power from the machines was used. Bitmain has always denied this is the case, however.Halong Mining wants to distribute ASIC miners \u201cfar and wide to help decentralize mining,\u201d BtcDrak said, adding that the company is considering open sourcing its board designs and software. This would help new manufacturers get a foothold in the industry, building on the research already done by Halong Mining over the past year.BtcDrak concluded:\u201cThere is a lot at stake here. A lot of time and money has been invested \u2026 and we have a huge opportunity to bring more diversity to Bitcoin mining, and in turn help secure the network more.\u201dThis article was slightly updated, in part to better reflect the scope (and limits) of our knowledge about Halong Mining and the DragonMint machines.", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 22}

This will enable NexPay to clear euro payments directly, without the involvement of commercial banks, and to issue IBAN accounts to Globitex clients just as banks issue accounts to their clients, which is could be an important step forward in terms of accessibility. According to the company, this regulatory development opens the way for the institutional- grade bitcoin exchange to deal with EUR fiat payments globally and sets a new level of legitimacy for the cryptocurrency industry overall. It also represents a significant step toward widespread adoption of Bitcoin as a unit of account suitable for global trade, with no geographic, political or monetary restrictions. Eventually, Globitex wants to allow producers to purchase exchange-listed products for bitcoin, and trading firms, and speculators to hedge their risks in bitcoin with derivatives trading.\u201cGlobitex is looking to set new cryptocurrency trading standards not only technologically, or by commodities linked product offering, but especially in Globitex\u2019s legal setup, ensuring safe passage to the digital age,\u201d said Liza Aizupiete, Managing Director of Globitex, who recently participated in a panel discussion on the future of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies at e-com21 in Riga, Latvia.While Bitcoin offers enormous advantages for international settlement due to its speed and low cost compared to legacy money transfer services, order-book depth and liquidity cannot yet support very large trades; therefore, bitcoin cannot yet serve as a currency of international trade settlement across the world\u2019s financial markets.Globitex wants to tackle this challenge by dramatically increasing bitcoin trading volumes and facilitating bitcoin\u2019s use across the spectrum of money and commodity markets, thereby allowing financial instruments and commodities like crude oil, gold and coffee to be priced directly in bitcoin.Physical-Settlement Futures Contracts as Important Enabling Factors\u201cI look forward to this evolution of digital currency trading platforms that ensure futures contracts with a physical delivery component,\u201d Matonis told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cStrong connection to the spot markets, including contract limits and physical delivery that is linked to provisioned commodities, will serve as the market standard for price integrity.\"Matonis outlined some risks associated with cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts. He pointed out that the price index is too easily gamed, for example, and that there is no physical commodity (private keys) for integrity of short positions, maintenance margins could potentially approach 100 percent so there is no real leverage during volatility, and there is a risk of limit-up, limit-down insolvency for certain smaller members.According to Matonis, the cash-settled bitcoin futures contract is a precursor to an exchange offering a proper physical-settlement futures contract like Globitex. In fact, decentralized crypto and physical-settlement Bitcoin markets will be more robust, Matonis explained to Bitcoin Magazine, since warehousing, open-contract limits and maintenance-margin calculations all behave differently under a digital assets class with physical settlement.Globitex is holding a token sale, to be issued on the Ethereum blockchain, for its GBX utility token to fund the scaling of its existing exchange infrastructure into a commodities spot and derivatives exchange for bitcoin.A short video explainer outlines a future where Bitcoin is the preferred medium of exchange for everything and permits cheaply settling international trades; swapping precious metals and commodities in seconds; and opening new trading options for farmers, manufacturing companies, metal miners, oil refineries and more.", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 22}

The new players promise to decentralize global video streaming, while at the same time making it more efficient.LBRYAccording to Jeremy Kauffman, co-founder and CEO of the blockchain-based content distribution platform LBRY, blockchain technology could transform the monetization of online content by altering the way that creators get paid, and eventually challenge YouTube.The LBRY protocol allows creators to publish online, making their content discoverable with a small payment in LBRY\u2019s own cryptocurrency token. Viewers pay creators in LBRY tokens to see their work. \u201c[Blockchain technology] allows us to build technology that\u2019s owned by the users rather than any one party,\u201d Kauffman said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem that blockchain [technology] solves.\u201d Kauffman explained that under the LBRY model, creators are paid without an intermediary taking an inappropriately large cut. Since LBRY is a protocol, the company can\u2019t control what gets discovered.Kauffman said that LBRY recruited 4,000 YouTubers in specifically targeted demographics, several of which have 500,000 or more subscribers, which seems a good first step toward challenging YouTube in its own turf.Theta LabsYouTube\u2019s co-founder Steve Chen himself, as well as Justin Kan, co-founder of Twitch, are among the advisors of Theta Labs, a subsidiary of live video streaming company SLIVER.tv, which is announcing a new blockchain-based decentralized video streaming network.\u201cTheta\u2019s innovation is set to disrupt today\u2019s online video industry much in the same way that the YouTube platform did to traditional video back in 2005,\u201d said Chen. \u201cOne of our biggest challenges had been the high costs of delivering video to various parts of the world, and this problem is only getting bigger with HD, 4K and higher quality video streams. I\u2019m excited to be part of the next evolution of the streaming space, helping Theta create a decentralized peer-to-peer network that can offer improved video delivery at lower costs.\u201dTheta is developing a new blockchain-based network, outlined in the Theta white paper, which could enable users worldwide with unutilized PC bandwidth and resources to cache and relay video streams to others in the network, while mining Theta tokens at the same time, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to the company, the new peer-to-peer decentralized network will allow for much more efficient, high-quality streaming without the need to develop expensive content delivery network infrastructure.In December, Theta will implement its first generation of ERC20-compliant tokens on the SLIVER.tv platform. These application tokens can be used for virtual gifting and incentivizing streamers. Eventually, these ERC20 tokens will be 1:1 exchangeable for native Theta tokens when the new blockchain launches at the end of 2018. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on the cutting edge of live streaming technology, and by leveraging blockchain [technology] we will truly be able to transform the video and entertainment industry,\u201d said Mitch Liu, co-founder and CEO of Theta Labs. \u201cTheta will be uniquely built to leverage the incentive mechanisms of the blockchain, enabling end-users to contribute their excess PC bandwidth and resources to relay video streams to others and earn Theta tokens at the same time.

Yu was a successful early cryptocurrency investor who became an internet celebrity with videos that received tens of millions of views. In 2011, Yu left his studies at Harvard and accepted a $100,000 Thiel Fellowship, like Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin before him, eventually launching Sprayable and Stream.The Stream Token was designed to allow digital media creators to earn a fair living from their work, without being exploited by streaming platforms that take unreasonably large shares of their revenue. It is also designed to free content creators from the strictures of advertising models that limit creativity and freedom of expression. \u201cStream Token is part of the larger Silicon Valley movement to fulfill the original intention of the internet: universal access to information.

As discussed in previous bitcoin market analyses, the bitcoin market has progressed in a parabolic envelope:Figure 1: BTC-USD, 1 Day Candles, Macro Parabolic EnvelopeAs of the time of writing this article, the current bitcoin market has broken its linear channel (outlined in purple) and is now testing the upper boundary of the parabolic envelope. As we approach the end of the parabolic envelope, the swings in price will become more sudden and more severe as the market attempts to remain within the constraints of its parabolic trend. As the upper limit of the parabolic trend advances, the lower limit also advances. Currently, all eyes are on this parabolic trend as individuals are trying to time the top of the market only to have their positions liquidated time and time again. It\u2019s never advisable to try and time the top of a parabolic market because the upper boundary that confines the market is growing in a parabolic fashion.Figure 2: BTC-USD, 2 Hour Candles, Micro TrendFigure 2 above shows a closer view of both the parabolic and linear trendline outlined in Figure 1. This image shows a textbook, 161% Fibonacci Extension from the previous all-time high where it ultimately found resistance on the parabolic envelope. The move that led to the current all-time high was sudden and doesn\u2019t offer much support below the current values. If bitcoin retraces, we can expect support to line on the linear trendline outlined in purple, and the 100% retracement values in the $7900s. However, if bitcoin manages to break these parabolic trend values and find support or continue upward, bitcoin could see prices as high as $12,000 (the next set of fibonacci extension values). It should be noted that a breaking of this parabolic envelope would mark a breakout of the 2.5 year long parabolic trend outlined in Figure 1. To date, we have yet to break above the parabolic envelope. Historically, when bitcoin encounters the parabolic trendlines, the market sees either a bearish reversal (if touching the upper curve) or a bullish reversal (if touching the lower curve). Right now, bitcoin is still in the waiting period as the market decides what the next move will be.Summary:Bitcoin saw 25% market growth in the last week.The market is currently testing the upper boundary of a 2.5 year long parabolic growth curve. Historically, this has lead to a market reversal that sends the price downward to test the lower parabolic curve.A breakout of the parabolic envelope could send the bitcoin market into the $12,000s.

His interests include technical aspects of a blockchain, upcoming crypto projects and carefully crafted beers. Follow him on Medium and on GitHub.\nThere is no disputing the fact that the Bitcoin network has scalability problems. Micropayment channels are a solution to increase the transaction rate and speed. Yet, this is not the golden solution \u2026 This micropayments solution needs a fixed amount of funds to be locked into each channel\u2019s multisignature wallet and requires a transaction for each channel creation and closure. This hinders the Blockchain network from upscaling to a global payment system because Bitcoin\u2019s capacity is limited.A recently published research paper by a university in Zurich suggests implementing a new layer in between the blockchain and payment channels that enables off-blockchain channel funding to reduce stress on the Bitcoin blockchain.What Are Micropayment Channels?The paper mentions two challenges: \u201cMicropayment channel networks create new problems, which have not been solved in the original papers. We identify two main challenges \u2014 the blockchain capacity and locked-in funds.\u201dBefore we go any further into this proposed solution, it is essential to understand the concept of micropayment channels. Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain network doesn\u2019t allow you to send many micropayments of tiny amounts of bitcoin. Bitcoin\u2019s block weight limit caps this at less than 10 transactions per second, on average. Payment channels let users lock up a fixed amount of funds in a multisignature wallet controlled by the client and receiver. A channel can be opened by sending a transaction to the blockchain. Next, an unlimited amount of payments can be made between the client and receiver. These payments are performed off-chain and only exist between both participants. Once a channel is closed, a final transaction containing end balances will be sent out to the Bitcoin network. This is the base implementation of micropayment channels; a more evolved implementation is the lightning network, which allows bidirectional payment channels.Reducing many hundreds, thousands or even more transactions to just two transactions per channel are a drastic improvement. Still, it is not enough for bringing the Bitcoin network to the level of a world-wide payment system. A channel can only exist between two participants. So, if each person in a group of 20 wants to open five channels, this will require a lot of transactions \u2014 200 to be exact. Besides that, there is no solution for when the amount of locked funds is exceeded for a specific channel.Proposed SolutionThe paper tells us about a new layer: \u201cWe introduce a new layer between the blockchain and the payment network, giving a three layered system ... The new second layer consists of multi-party micropayment channels we call channel factories, which can quickly fund regular two party channels.\u201dThe paper suggest a three-layered system in which the first and third layers already exist. The first layer locks the funds, and the third layer performs the actual transfers of currencies. The new second layer can be seen as a channel factory. It is responsible for creating multi-party micropayment channels and quickly refunding wallets when they are almost depleted. The paper calculated a savings of up to 90 percent for a group of 20 nodes with 100 channels in between them.Instead of sending a blockchain transaction for each channel creation or closure, the paper suggests a system where just one transaction is needed to open multiple channels without further blockchain contact. Funds are locked into a shared wallet between a group of nodes instead of a specific channel. Furthermore, funds can be moved between groups with just an attached message with further details such as a receiver address. All of this happens off-blockchain.The only addressed risk is that a user within a group can close the channel factory: the second layer. This induces a higher mining fee because more blockchain space is used. While this is not a big risk \u2014 a user won\u2019t gain personal advantage by doing so \u2014 it does limit the usefulness of large groups. Next, it is possible that the receiver doesn\u2019t sign a transaction. The paper introduces the use of either timelocks or punishments for dishonest parties. They will focus on timelocks because they think it performs much better. After a timelock has elapsed, the current status of the channel will be broadcasted to the blockchain and the channel will be closed; no punishment is applied.There is no risk in securing the funds. The multisignature wallet has a many-to-many constraint containing all signatures of the involved actors. Funds can only be spent when all actors have signed the transaction, so no one can be deprived of funds without signing for it themselves.", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 27}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin\u2019s capacity is limited. Meanwhile, smart contracts can be resource intensive. So even though Bitcoin has always supported basic smart contract functionality, the two have never been a natural match.But a recent topic of research spearheaded by Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra could help fix this. Recently presented as key part of his presentation at Scaling Bitcoin Stanford, \u201cScriptless Scripts\u201d have the potential to completely move certain smart contracts off of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain \u2014 while still leveraging all of Bitcoin\u2019s security.Bitcoin and Smart ContractsSmart contracts, first proposed by digital currency veteran Nick Szabo in the 1990s, are essentially self-executing contracts. Most typically, they send money from someone to someone else if specific conditions are met. For example, if someone streams a song, a payment is automated from the streamer to the artist.While smart contracts are often associated with \u201csecond generation\u201d blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin has always supported basic smart contracts, too. In a way, any Bitcoin transaction is technically a smart contract: Funds are typically moved on the condition that a valid cryptographic signature is provided. Slightly more advanced smart contracts \u2014 such as multisig and timelocks \u2014 are used to enable second-layer protocols like the Lightning Network.But there are problems with blockchain-based smart contracts. For one, as they grow more complex, they require more resources to execute. This is especially problematic because all nodes on the network need to execute the contract \u2014 not just the parties involved with the contract itself.This network-wide execution also means that the parties involved have no privacy regarding what their smart contract entails: The entire network will know exactly what it looks like. By extension, this is bad for fungibility as well. If the smart contract is unpopular for some reason, the funds involved \u2014 publicly visible on the blockchain \u2014 are tainted.As smart contracts become more complex, they can even become a security risk. Alternative software implementations might, for example, interpret details of contracts slightly differently, making it harder to keep all nodes on the network in consensus. And potential bugs in these smart contracts are public as well, which increases the chance of hacks.But Poelstra, among others, thinks that many of these problems can be solved by actually moving the bulk of contracts off of the blockchain. Instead of having all nodes on the network calculate the entire smart contract, only the parties involved with the contract should perform this function.The trick is to ensure that the rest of the network does still correctly enforce the outcome of the contract: The payment must only be made if the required conditions are met.SchnorrPoelstra originally began researching \u201cScriptless Scripts\u201d (a phrase he also coined himself) in the context of the Mimblewimble protocol. This stripped down version of Bitcoin offers more privacy and better scalability but does not support script: the bits of code embedded in Bitcoin transactions that allow for most basic smart contract features. So, Poelstra figured out how to get the utility offered by scripts without actually requiring them on the blockchain: Scriptless Scripts.The key to Scriptless Scripts is that (fairly) regular cryptographic signatures can indirectly reveal something that\u2019s not part of the transaction that includes the signature. In other words, when someone signs to validate an ordinary Bitcoin transaction, it holds that a smart contract that is not hosted on the blockchain still executes faithfully.This is made possible with Schnorr signatures. These types of signatures are not yet implemented on the Bitcoin protocol, but it is possible that they could be deployed within a year or so from now.Schnorr signatures allow for signature aggregation; several signatures can be mathematically combined into a single signature. And, importantly for this use case, this math is \u201clinear.\u201d This basically means it\u2019s possible to perform relatively straightforward but very expressive math on these signatures.Oversimplified, it works something like this:Private keys and signatures are, of course, really just numbers, where the latter is derived from the former. Since this is a simplified example, let\u2019s say one private key looks like 10, and half of the Schnorr signature derived from that private key looks like 10000. And the other private key looks like 15, with the second half of the Schnorr signature looking like 15000. In this simplified example, the Schnorr signature would then look like 25000 (or 10000 + 15000).And since both halves of the signature are just numbers, it\u2019s possible to perform math between them. For instance, in this simplified example, the difference between these halves is 5000 (or 15000 \u2013 10000).While the reality is more complex, Schnorr\u2019s linearity allows for several of these kinds of math \u201ctricks.\u201dThe Smart ContractNow let\u2019s say that a streamer wants to listen to a song by an artist. The artist has the right to this song, and it will play for the streamer if (and only if) the artist's signature is provided to a server where the song is hosted. Since we\u2019re simplifying, let\u2019s say that this \u201csong signature\u201d looks like 7000. The streamer is willing to pay the artist one bitcoin for this song signature, to listen to the song. (He wants to listen to the song really badly.)In this simplified example, the streamer and the artist can automate this trade by doing two things. First, they create a fairly normal Bitcoin transaction that sends one bitcoin from the streamer to the artist, if the streamer and the artist both provide their half of a Schnorr signature to create a full Schnorr signature. (In reality, this step requires some extra safety precautions to ensure no one loses money, but it is relatively simple.)The next step is where it gets a bit more complex.The artist knows what her half of the Schnorr signature looks like; since we\u2019re simplifying, let\u2019s say it looks like 8000. And she knows what her song signature looks like: 7000. As such, she can calculate the difference between these two: 1000. This is called the adaptor signature. The artist then hands this adaptor signature \u2014 1000 \u2014 to the streamer.Here\u2019s where the cryptographic magic happens.By modifying the ordinary signature verification method, the streamer can actually verify that the adaptor signature he just received (1000) is indeed the difference between the artist's half Schnorr signature and her song signature \u2014 even though the streamer does not have access to either signature yet. (And thanks to cryptographic tricks called \u201czero-knowledge proofs,\u201d something like this can actually be done in a surprisingly broad range of scenarios, not just in signatures as this example portrays.)Now, having verified that the adaptor signature (1000) checks out, the streamer can, in turn, give his half of the Schnorr signature to the artist because once the artist uses the streamer\u2019s half to create a full signature and broadcasts this over the Bitcoin network, she automatically reveals her half of the Schnorr signature (8000) to the streamer as well.Using the artist\u2019s half of the Schnorr signature, the streamer can now subtract the adaptive signature: 1000. By subtracting the adaptive signature from the artist\u2019s half Schnorr signature (8000 \u2013 1000) the streamer indeed learns the artist\u2019s \u201csong signature\u201d: 7000. And now he can listen to the song.In other words, by broadcasting the transaction that pays her one bitcoin, the artist automatically sells the streamer the signature: a smart contract.From the perspective of the blockchain \u2014 that is, the rest of the world \u2014 the transaction is quite regular. Nothing about the smart contract, other than the \u201csettlement transaction,\u201d \u00a0is ever recorded on the blockchain.

He's spent years building products and solutions, all the while writing over 300 articles for various magazines covering software reviews, programming tips, interviews and music piracy.\nThe new Bitcoin-based, multi-signature wallet from Abra\u00a0is being released hot on the heels of their recent funding announcement, supporting ether and 52 fiat currencies.Now, after running our service for the past few months with tens of millions of dollars of funds, we\u2019re ready for commercial deployment of our multi-signature solution.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0CEO Bill BarhydtThe new update is currently rolling out to current users and is expected to be completed during the first week of December 2017. The Abra wallet is available on Android and iOS. This new release is a full rewrite that adds support for ether as a currency, as well as the \u201c2-of-2\u201d multi-signature model that requires both Abra and the consumer to sign a transaction when the consumer is holding anything but bitcoin.In speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Barhydt said this is the first phase of the next generation of their product \u2014 what they call \u201cSynthetic Currency.\u201d This concept will conceivably allow you to fold any asset class onto your phone and tie it to bitcoin, like real estate, art, precious metals, etc. The first supported asset class is currency. Abra\u2019s idea is similar in concept to what Venmo or Paypal provide \u2014 and what banks are now catching up with \u2014 in that it allows two parties to quickly exchange money but without a central authority. Abra now allows users to deposit any supported currency to a phone through a number of methods, including Automated Clearing House (ACH), wire transfer, bitcoin and American Express. It is also testing cash deposits in certain countries which have yet to be disclosed. Deposited funds are then used to buy bitcoin at a fixed conversion rate, determined at the time of transfer. For example, assuming bitcoin costs $10,000 each and you deposited $10,000 in fiat, you would have 1 BTC. If the price of bitcoin goes up, the contract code would shed the excess satoshis so you still had $10,000 worth in fiat. If bitcoin goes down, then Abra makes up the difference. He declined to comment on how Abra would manage the counterparty risk, citing proprietary information.\u201cFor the next few months we\u2019ll be working with this 2-of-2 p2sh [pay-to-script hash] script-based solution that requires both Abra and the consumer (via their Abra app) to sign a transaction,\u201d he added. \u201cIn a few months, we will migrate to a full 2-of-3 multi-signature smart contract solution that will enable a Contract Oracle to sign in lieu of either counterparty. This will provide significantly more protection to both the consumer as well as Abra in the case that either party disappears and will allow for much larger contracts due to the diminished counterparty risk inherent in the 2-of-2 model.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 28}

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nLibra, a developer of blockchain tax and auditing software, has launched Crypto Office, a new product aimed at the industry\u2019s biggest players: exchanges, market makers and hedge funds.The company will make its formal announcement November 28, 2017, at Consensus Invest in New York, while also naming cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift and liquidity provider XBTO as early adopters of the technology.The product announcement comes the day after Libra also announced $7.8 million in Series A financing. The round was led by an undisclosed European family office. Participating investors included Liberty City Ventures; XBTO; Boost VC, an accelerator run by longtime cryptocurrency investor Adam Draper; and Lee Linden, an entrepreneur and early stage investor. Libra, which recently relocated its offices from San Francisco to New York, plans to put those funds to use in hiring more software engineers and expanding its sales and marketing efforts. The venture previously raised $2 million, bringing its total funding to $10 million. Into the EnterpriseCrypto Office is not Libra\u2019s first product. In 2014, the startup announced LibraTax, a blockchain tax software geared to helping consumers stay on top of their bitcoin and cryptocurrency trades and keep the tax collectors happy. The U.S. Government considers cryptocurrency a property, like stocks and bonds. As a result, anyone who buys and sells cryptocurrency needs to keep accurate records of all the transactions they make, so they can account for every acquisition and disposal. \u00a0Now Libra is shifting its focus to enterprise applications with its new product, Crypto Office, aimed at institutional investors. The timing is good. More than 90 hedge funds focused solely on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies entered the market this year alone. All of these funds have a fiduciary responsibility to their investors to keep accurate, up-to-date transaction records. As Libra sees it, most of these funds are relying on manual processes or auditing software retrofitted to the blockchain to track trades and run the numbers. These complexities can make it difficult for these companies to scale their businesses and keep up with the needs of their customers. \u201cRight now there are guys that are up until 2AM at these hedge funds and family offices trying to keep track of everything manually on spreadsheets,\u201d Jake Benson, CEO at Libra, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201c[Crypto Office] is a missing piece to what is out there.\u201dIt\u2019s not just funds. Market makers \u2014 companies like XBTO that stand ready to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on a regular basis at a publicly quoted price \u2014 and exchanges also need visibility into their data, so they can understand their profit and losses and get a real-time picture of their performance. \"Calculating tax on cryptocurrency transactions is just one of the capabilities of our software,\" Benson noted. \"We also bring information transparency to transactions such that individuals and businesses can calculate their revenue and profitability of their trades. In fact, some of our clients are buying our software to help with performance reporting not tax reporting.\u00a0\u201cIt is all one interconnected ecosystem,\u201d Jeremy Drane, chief commercial officer at Libra, explained to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cInstitutional investors invest money into funds. Those funds work with market makers to place trades on exchanges. Each of those three stakeholders need to have an efficient and scalable infrastructure.\u201dData Wranglers At its core, Crypto Office is a set of business logic that sits on top of another Libra product dubbed Enterprise Platform, which does the heavy lifting of pulling data off the blockchains. Both solutions live in the cloud and Crypto Office is available on a yearly subscription basis. Essentially, Enterprise Platform does three things. First, it allows users to connect to blockchains, exchanges and other data sources (such as wallets and enterprise systems) through a single sign-on, so they don\u2019t have to juggle passwords. Second, it extracts, normalizes and enriches the data. This is key because different databases store their data differently. For instance, one exchange may use the ticker symbol \u201cBTC\u201d for bitcoin while another uses \u201cXBT.\u201d And because ether (ETH), the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, can be represented by up to 18 decimal places, one exchange may roll that up to two decimal places while another rolls it up to nine, and so on. All of these variables need to be standardized. And, in instances where a variable may exist on some databases but not on others, that variable may need to be created so everything fits snuggly into the same table when it\u2019s all been gathered together on a database server. (Libra stores the data on a PostgreSQL server.) Given that some funds pull information from five, 10 or 20 different exchanges, this is not an easy task. \u201cRight now everyone is pulling data out of exchanges or data from the blockchain in a very manual way and then throwing it into Excel spreadsheets,\u201d said Benson. \u201cThere is no institutional grade solution that automates this stuff.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Once the data is wrangled, Crypto Office steps in to generate the information that will ultimately go into making up the various reports, like tax, inventory, profit and loss, that market makers, exchanges and hedge funds require to run their businesses. Enterprise Platform then assembles that information and sends it off to Crypto Office\u2019s user interface, packages it into reports that get sent to investors or makes it available to other enterprise systems via application program interfaces. In summary, the goal of Libra Crypto Office and Enterprise Platform is to take data from millions of relevant blockchain transactions and make it continuously available in near real time, so investors can get an overall picture of their performance and stay compliant.If Libra\u2019s hunch is correct, the company could see big opportunities in the cryptocurrency space, at least until other tax services like Quicken, TurboTax and SAP catch up and adapt their services to interface with blockchains.", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 28}

Over the weekend, we saw a test of the lower curve that proved to be proper support and propelled the market into a bounce that now has the market testing the upper linear trendline (purple lines) at the time of this article:Figure 2: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Test of Upper TrendlineAs the bitcoin market approaches the upper trendline, the price action will coincide with a test of the previous all-time high. Expect this to be a point of resistance with possible market turbulence. However, if we manage to break that resistance level and hold support above the trendline, there is no clear resistance until we test the parabolic envelope in the upper $8,000s. If we look at the macro indicators for this move, we see some signs that have proven to be indications of short-term rallies leading to corrections:Figure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Bollinger Band TrendThe last two corrections bitcoin has seen came on the tail of a minor pullback that rebounded to a new all-time high. The one-day candle trend is, so far, showing a repeated pattern that has led into a reversal each time it tested the upper parabolic curve. A rounding of the Bollinger bands during an upward move (shown in purple) is a forecast for decreased upward volatility that will lead to either a consolidation period or a reversal to the lower Bollinger bands. While a reversal is not required of this move upward, one can speculate that once the price tags the upper parabolic curve, we could see a pullback to the lower Bollinger bands on the one-day charts. A pullback to the lower Bollinger bands would see support quite nicely with the lower parabolic curve.One of two outcomes can be expected from this move upward: either we will test the upper parabolic trendline and reverse, or we will break above and consolidate before continuing on a very strong bullish move to new highs. However, these macro moves have become increasingly more demanding on the market as we continue to get squeezed within the parabolic envelope. The forecast of the Bollinger bands indicates we are not likely to see a sustained move higher without a consolidation period or a pullback.Summary:Over the weekend, bitcoin saw another test of the lower parabolic curve that proved to be strong support.After testing the parabolic curve, the market rebounded and has now established a new all-time high.If this trend continues, bitcoin could see prices in the mid to upper $8,000s before any noticeable resistance stands in the way of the price growth.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Three new operators are among those developing trading platforms to meet this need, with blockchain-based tokens pegged to the underlying assets.AnkorusAnkorus is establishing a platform that will permit trading traditional assets, including stocks, bonds, futures, options, gold, silver, commodities, ETFs, FX and bitcoin futures with cryptocurrency. \u201cAnkorus will establish an online exchange populated by any financial asset currently available worldwide,\u201d reads the Ankorus white paper. \u201cVarious auditing measures will be taken to establish transparency, and customers will be able to validate that tokenised assets are fully backed and held by Ankorus.\u201dTo enable cryptocurrency holders to buy real-world financial assets, Ankorus will create and allocate tokens that are exactly value-pegged to the underlying assets in exchange for cryptocurrency. Ankorus will hold its \u201cfundraising contribution\u201d or \u201cToken Generation Event\u201d (TGE) between November 25 and December 25. The ANK token will be distributed to contributors during the TGE. \u201cThe ANK is a utility token, used for commissions, for datafeeds, professional technical charting software, webinars, financial education materials and also membership for those who wish,\u201d Ankorus CEO John Cruz told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe ANK token will be allocated during our TGE and later listed on exchanges, beginning with EtherDelta. It is an ERC20 token.\u201dAnother token, the Anchor Token, will be the asset value-pegged token, separately created to tokenize specific securities using a yet-to-be-determined technology.\u201cAnchor Tokens will come later, after we receive the requisite regulatory approval,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cAnchor Tokens will be created for our customers when they wish to tokenize specific assets. For example, if a customer wishes to purchase and tokenize Apple stock, we create an Apple Anchor Token (known as AAPL.A) or simply credit the customer with them if we created one earlier.\u201dOne of the most interesting asset classes that Ankorus is targeting is that of traditional financial instruments based on cryptocurrencies, such as futures and derivatives. A few weeks ago Bitcoin Magazine reported that CME Group, one of the world\u2019s largest derivatives exchanges, will launch a bitcoin futures product before the end of Q4 2017. In a video, Cruz explains why he considers CME bitcoin futures as a breakthrough that could soon push bitcoin\u2019s price up to $50,000, and expresses confidence in Ankorus\u2019s ability to offer CME bitcoin futures trading soon. It\u2019s worth noting that Ankorus\u2019s offering can be seen as the reverse of CME bitcoin futures: while CME will offer a traditional financial instrument tied to cryptocurrencies to investors that prefer not to hold and trade cryptocurrencies directly, Ankorus wants to make CME bitcoin futures and other traditional financial instruments available to cryptocurrency holders.One is left to wonder how Ankorus will navigate the compliance minefield, which has blocked similar initiatives before. The Ankorus team insists that they will be totally SEC-compliant and follow all KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and CTF (Counter-Terrorist Financing) regulations. According to the white paper, Ankorus intends to become a fully registered broker-dealer, acquire membership on a large and reputable exchange, follow best practices for insurance and auditing on a regular basis, and establish a compliant trading platform that will bridge the crypto and finance worlds. \u201cBy becoming a broker-dealer entity, we will get SEC blessing,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cEveryone else is trying to tokenize assets by not being a broker-dealer entity; this is where they run into trouble with the SEC.\u201d \u201cWithin the team we have experience of complying with different market regulators\u2019 KYC, AML and CTF requirements for an FX remittance company,\u201d Ankorus COO Haldane Marnoch told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cPEP [Politically Exposed Persons] lists are vetted and we check against a suite of sanctions lists too. Documents supplied by our customers for proof of identity or proof of address expire and need to be renewed on a regular basis. Source of funds also needs to be proven for larger transactions.\u201cOur team is familiar with all the provisions required for operating across multiple jurisdictions,\u201d continued Marnoch. \u201cWe\u2019ll use as our primary reference the standards set by the SEC and the CFTC, but naturally we\u2019ll be implementing processes to comply with each and every market we trade in, for instance the FCA in the U.K.\u201d\u201cWe will become a division of a Futures Commissions Merchant (FCM), expected early March, and will be able to fill orders for CME bitcoin futures at that time,\u201d added Cruz.LAToken and Jibrel NetworkLAToken (LAT), which recently raised $19.6 million in a token sale, wants to broaden the use of cryptocurrencies in the real economy and allow cryptocurrency holders to diversify their portfolio by getting access to tokens linked to the price of real assets. The LAT platform is already operational: asset tokens can be created, listed for sale and traded on the LAT platform. At this time, tokens linked to the price of stocks (e.g., Apple, Amazon, Tesla), commodities (oil, gold, silver) and real estate are already being traded on the LAT platform. Tokens linked to artwork are soon to follow.According to the white paper, the LAT platform provides cryptocurrency holders with transparent price discovery and diversification across multiple asset classes, allowing for the creation or listing of third-party asset tokens compliant with LAToken disclosure and legal structure rules.Jibrel Network wants to provide currencies, equities, commodities and other financial assets and instruments as standard ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Jibrel Network\u2019s draft white paper explains that the platform will support tokens, dubbed Crypto Depository Receipts (CryDRs), which represent ownership of an underlying traditional asset held by Jibrel. On release, Jibrel will support six fiat currencies (USD, CNY, EUR, GBP, RUB, AED) and two money-market instruments. In the future, Jibrel plans offer CryDRs pegged to a wide range of currencies, commodities, securities and derivatives. The project will hold a token pre-sale between November 27 and January 27.Both LAToken and Jibrel Network expect to be fully compliant with applicable regulations, including KYC/AML rules, and apply for relevant licenses where needed. Full compliance may prevent the companies from targeting customers in certain jurisdictions. For example, the Jibrel token sale will not be available to U.S., Chinese and Singaporean residents.", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 17}
{"title": "A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Claiming Your Bitcoin Gold (and Selling It)", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/beginners-guide-claiming-your-bitcoin-gold-and-selling-it/", "birthday": "Nov 16, 2017  2:59 PM EST", "date": "2017-11-16 19:59:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThis is a re-write of \u201cA Beginner\u2019s Guide to Claiming Your \u2018Bitcoin Cash\u2019 (and Selling It)\u201d. Please note: Everything in this article is just advice based on our best understanding of the current situation.Bitcoin Gold (also referred to as Bgold, and trading under the ticker BTG) launched November 12, 2017. Since the Bitcoin blockchain technically forked on Bitcoin block 491407, anyone who held bitcoin (BTC) on October 24, 2017 should have an equivalent amount of BTG attributed to their Bitcoin private keys.In our beginner\u2019s guide to surviving the Bgold and SegWit2x forks, we explained how to secure your private keys so you could be sure to access your BTG and B2X. The B2X fork has since been suspended by the leaders of that project, however, and it currently seems very unlikely to happen in any serious way.As such, this follow-up article explains how you can claim (and potentially use) your BTG \u2014 only your BTG.Be CarefulGood news: Bitcoin Gold enforces strong replay protection. This means you can\u2019t accidentally spend your BTC when you mean to spend BTG or vice versa.As such, if you don\u2019t care about BTG at all right now, you don\u2019t need to do a thing. You can just keep using bitcoin as you always have. If you ever change your mind (and don\u2019t lose your Bitcoin private keys in the meantime), you can still claim your BTG at any point in the future.Likewise, if you want to hold onto your BTG long term, you also don\u2019t need to do anything right now. You can keep using BTC as if nothing happened; just make sure to never lose your private keys.(In both these cases, however, it could come in handy to keep a record of the Bitcoin addresses that stored your bitcoins at the time of the split. This is not strictly necessary, but your future self may thank you if you do it. You should be able to find this information in your wallet of choice, though where you find it may differ a little bit from wallet to wallet. Alternatively, you could move all your coins to a new address. If you then look up all your transactions since October 25, 2017, and note which addresses spent coins since that date, you know which addresses held coins at the time of the split.)Now let\u2019s assume you do care about BTG right now, at least enough to want to sell your share. (1 BTG is trading around 0.02 BTC at the time of writing of this article, so you could earn a 2 percent \u201cdividend\u201d on your BTC if you decide to sell.)If you followed the advice outlined in our beginner\u2019s guide, the good news is that you should be in full control of your Bitcoin private keys. This means you now hold BTC as well as BTG.The bad news is that it\u2019s not necessarily easy or safe to claim your BTG. If you\u2019re using insecure (or even malicious) software, you may accidentally expose your private keys. And because these are the same private keys that secure your BTC, this exposure could lead to your BTC being stolen. You stand to lose much more from losing your BTC than you stand to gain from selling your BTG.Therefore, you are going to want to take your time and make sure you understand what you are doing well enough to do it without exposing your private keys. Your BTG isn\u2019t going anywhere.Accessing Your CoinsIn our beginner\u2019s guide to surviving the Bgold (and SegWit2x) forks, we explained how to secure your private keys and recommended different wallet options. Here, you can find, per option, how to access your BTG.Note that while it\u2019s not strictly necessary in all cases, it\u2019s probably best to first move your bitcoins (BTC) to a new address, or even a whole new wallet with a new seed, before you even touch your BTG. This way you don\u2019t add any security risks, while it\u2019s potentially also a bit better for privacy. (More on this below.)Update: It was pointed out to us that the Coinomi wallet is now closed source. This means that you should definitely follow the suggested advice, and first move your BTC to a new address or a whole new wallet with a new seed before inserting your private keys into the Coinomi wallet!Paper WalletThe first recommendation in our beginner\u2019s guide to surviving the Bgold (and SegWit2x) forks was to use a paper wallet. This advice was given in the context of storing your coins long term in particular. But if you want to access your BTG, you can, of course, do this right away.However, the point of a paper wallet really is that your private keys are not stored in any device that could be hacked. Therefore, if you\u2019re going to upload your private key into a Bitcoin Gold wallet, you should definitely create a whole new paper wallet with a new private key for your bitcoin (BTC). It\u2019s probably best to then first sweep your private keys with a Bitcoin (BTC) wallet, and then send the coins to this new paper wallet for BTC. Electrum and Coinomi are two wallets that allow you to sweep Bitcoin private keys. Look for the \u201csweep\u201d option in the menus of these wallets; that\u2019s where you can scan the QR-code displayed on your paper wallet. (Alternatively, you could type in the private key.) Once you\u2019ve done this, send the bitcoins to the new paper wallet.Once your bitcoins are stored safely on the new paper wallet (ideally after at least one confirmation), the old paper wallet still holds the BTG.Now, the same trick must be repeated to access your BTG. Electrum does not support BTG, but Coinomi does. Coinomi also published a blog post explaining exactly how to access your BTG. This includes instructions for paper wallets.Regular WalletOur second recommendation was to use a regular wallet, as listed on bitcoin.org.How to access your BTG if you were using a regular wallet differs from one wallet to the next. But in most cases, Coinomi is once again the best wallet to import your keys into. While originally written for Bitcoin Cash, this Coinomi blog post explains exactly how to make that switch for a number of wallets. (Just mentally replace \u201cBCH\u201d for \u201cBTG\u201d wherever relevant.)Full Node WalletOur third recommendation was to use a full node wallet, like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots.These wallets store your private keys in a dedicated folder on your computer. You can make a backup of this folder using the menu in your wallet and select \"Backup wallet.\" Once you\u2019ve done this, you should be able to import this backup into the Bitcoin Gold full node, Bitcoin Gold Core.But once again, it\u2019s a lot easier (and possibly even safer) to export your private keys from your Bitcoin full node and import them into the Coinomi mobile wallet. While originally written for Bitcoin Cash, this Coinomi blog post explains how to do that for BTG as well. (Just mentally replace \u201cBCH\u201d for \u201cBTG\u201d wherever relevant.)Hardware WalletWe also recommended using a hardware wallet to keep your private keys secure \u2014 though we also noted that these wallets don\u2019t necessarily make it easy to access your BTG.Indeed, at the time of writing, no hardware wallet has enabled access to BTG. However, Ledger and Trezor have published blog posts indicating that they will be working on it. If you use either of these wallets, keep an eye out for announcements on their social media or blogs. Digital Bitbox and Keep Key have also published blog posts on the Bgold fork, suggesting they might support it; but they don\u2019t support it yet. Keep an eye on their social media and blog to see if that changes.Other (Non-bitcoin.org) Wallets, Exchanges, etc.If you did not follow our advice and instead stored your BTC in any other wallet, or on an exchange, or anywhere else, you may or may not still be able to claim your BTG. In this case, you\u2019ll have to figure out for yourself whether this is the case or not, and how to do so. This Coinomi blog post may, once again, be of help for some wallets. (Just mentally replace \u201cBCH\u201d for \u201cBTG\u201d wherever relevant.)Using (or Selling) Your BTGOnce you have claimed your BTG, you can use it however you please. Just like any other altcoin, you could, for example, sell it for BTC or perhaps spend it somewhere if it\u2019s accepted for payment, etc.If you decide to sell your BTG, there are a number of exchanges where you can do this. The Bitcoin Gold website lists most of them here. (Which of these you decide to trust is up to you; we\u2019re not giving any particular advice.)But there are three more factors to keep in mind before doing so.The first factor is privacy. Your public keys (which are linked to your BTC and BTG addresses) are identical for BTC and BTG. This means that whenever you spend your BTG (for example, to send them to an exchange), you do not only reveal your BTG addresses but also your BTC addresses. This can, in turn, reveal a lot about your current holdings as well as your past and future transactions and can even, by extension, reveal other data about people or entities you transact with. Make sure you are comfortable with giving up this privacy if you are going to send your BTG to an exchange or anywhere else.The second factor is mostly theoretical at this point but worth a quick mention nonetheless: \u00a0security. By revealing your public key when spending BTG, you strip away one layer of cryptographic security, even for your BTC addresses. This doesn\u2019t mean that your BTC are insecure right now, but there is an increased chance that your BTC won\u2019t be secure at some point in the (far) future when this particular cryptographic standard is weakened. It is, therefore, best to move your BTC to a new address, at least some time within the next couple of years.The third factor was already mentioned but bears repeating: If you\u2019re using insecure software to claim your BTG, your BTC may be at risk. It\u2019s probably best to move your BTC to a new address or even a whole new wallet with a new wallet seed before you even start meddling with BTG \u2014 regardless of which wallet you were using. That way, if you do mess up with insecure BTG software, you shouldn't lose your BTC.So, to Recap \u20261. You don\u2019t have to do anything if you don\u2019t want to, and there is no rush. If your private keys are secure, your BTG is secure.2.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIn case there were any remaining doubts, it now seems clear that the SegWit2x hard fork will not happen.\nThe SegWit2x project, a product of the New York Agreement signed onto by a long list of companies and miners in May, had scheduled a hard fork to double Bitcoin\u2019s block weight limit today. And while the controversial effort was suspended by leaders of the project last week, this would not have stopped anyone else from proceeding with it. Companies like Coinbase were indeed taking into account that the SegWit2x hard fork could still happen.\nThe Fork That Wasn\u2019t\nSegWit2x nodes \u2014 most notably btc1 \u2014 were programmed to fork away from the Bitcoin blockchain this afternoon (UTC) to create the SegWit2x blockchain and a new currency, often referred to as B2X. However, not a single SegWit2x block has been mined since fork point, nor is there any indication that this is likely to happen. For all intents and purposes, there is no SegWit2x \u2014 nor a B2X.\nFurther, software bugs in the btc1 codebase made all btc1 implementations grind to a halt even before it reached the expected fork point. While Bitcoin and SegWit2x nodes were widely expected to share a single blockchain up until block 494783 and then to go their own ways at block 494784, btc1 nodes never made it past block 494782.\nThis is mainly because the first block on the SegWit2x chain was required to have a \u201cbase block\u201d larger than one megabyte. This is how the chain would diverge from the original Bitcoin protocol. But due to what is referred to as an \u201coff-by-one error,\u201d SegWit2x blocks started to reject smaller-than-one-megabyte blocks one block too soon \u2014 at block 494,783 instead of 494,784.\nMoreover, another btc1 bug prevented miners from mining a big enough block when it was needed. So even if some miners did want to proceed with the fork, they accidentally wouldn\u2019t have done so \u2014 at least not automatically. Miners would instead have had to manually configure their block weight settings, but it\u2019s unlikely they knew about this step. Btc1 maintainer Jeff Garzik (while also denying there was a problem) has since released a patch to resolve this issue.\nBut judging by the absence of any SegWit2x blocks, the patch hasn\u2019t made a difference, most likely because few, if any, miners were interested in mining on the SegWit2x chain in the first place.\nNO2X?\nDespite the seeming failure of SegWit2x to take off in any way, it should be noted that there is technically no way to declare a fork like SegWit2x officially \u201cdead\u201d or \u201cfailed.\u201d\nWhile unlikely, it\u2019s always possible that the SegWit2x hard fork could proceed at some point in the future. In fact, there is no way to tell whether the SegWit2x chain is currently being mined with a little bit of hash power right now, and it is strictly impossible to foresee whether it will be mined later on. Perhaps a SegWit2x block will be found a day from now, a week from now or even ten years from now, at which point SegWit2x and B2X will technically come into existence.\nHowever, since the SegWit2x chain did not include a mining difficulty reset, it will be as hard to mine a B2X block as it currently is to mine a BTC block. Meanwhile, market support for B2X appears to be extremely low, with B2X futures trading below 2 percent of BTC. So even if miners decide to mine B2X blocks, they\u2019d almost certainly be earning far less than they would by mining BTC. Or, more accurately, they\u2019d spend more on electricity bills than they\u2019d be able to earn by mining B2X. The financial incentive to mine the SegWit2x chain just isn\u2019t there.\n\nAlternatively, SegWit2x could see a bit of a rebirth in the form of \u201cBitcoinX\u201d (BTX). This project, supposedly started by disappointed SegWit2x supporters, will take a snapshot of bitcoin balances at block height 494,783 and start a SegWit2x-like altcoin that offers all BTC holders the equivalent amount in BTX. Though, while this coin is arguably more viable than B2X thanks to a mining difficulty reset and more, it really is a new coin \u2014 arguably even more so than B2X would have been.", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 17}

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nA group of people are on a mission to bring Bitcoin back to the state of Wyoming after unfriendly laws made it impossible to transact with cryptocurrencies there more than two years ago.The Wyoming Blockchain Coalition announced its formation this week. Its volunteer members aim to create a legal and regulatory environment in the state that welcomes cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology companies with open arms.Among the group\u2019s advisors are Patrick Byrne, CEO of Overstock \u2014 Byrne lives in Utah but has been a Bitcoin advocate for years \u2014 a former Wyoming governor, and two deans and a computer science department head from the University of Wyoming.Outdated LawsBitcoin used to be welcome in Wyoming. But a 2015 interpretation of the Wyoming Money Transmitters Act (which the state passed in 2003, years before Bitcoin even existed) by the Wyoming Division of Banking made it impractical for cryptocurrency exchanges to operate in the state. Cryptocurrencies are not specifically included on the list of \u201cpermissible investments\u201d within the Act, as stocks or securities would be. As a result, after learning it would have to put up huge financial backing to stay in operation in the state, Coinbase suspended its operations in Wyoming indefinitely in June 2015. \u00a0\u00a0But a lot of people think the law doesn\u2019t make sense. They see cryptocurrency as the future, and they think Wyoming would benefit from being more progressive.Caitlin Long is one of those people. Now living in New York, where she serves as chairman and president at smart contracts platform company Symbiont, Long grew up in Laramie, Wyoming.Over the summer, she wanted to give back to her alma mater. But when she went to personally fund an endowment for female engineers at the University of Wyoming, she found out the school was unable to accept her bitcoin as an appreciated asset. \u00a0Fortunately, Long was able to find a charity outside of Wyoming that could legally liquidate the bitcoin and send it to the university through a donor-advised fund.\u201cThey still got the cash, but it prompted a lot of discussion internally in the university about \u2018what just happened here?\u2019\u201d Long told Bitcoin Magazine.Long would not disclose how much she donated, but typically, donations to an endowment are $50,000 and up. \u201cWhen universities have donors that are interested in donating properties, they usually try to find ways to accept the properties,\u201d she said. \u00a0The event prompted a lot of discussion among some of the people within the university and eventually led to the formation of a coalition aimed at educating about and advocating for the adoption of blockchain technology in the state. \u00a0Long offered up her services as an advisor member. \u201cI\u2019m in the business,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I volunteered to help with both the bitcoin and the blockchain education efforts.\u201dNo Time to LoseThe coalition is moving quickly. Within a week, the group formed an LLC, sent out a press release stating its goals and launched a website. \u201cThis is very, very new, and it is happening in real time,\u201d said Long.They have good reason to make haste. The new legislative session begins in February. If the coalition wants to push through a bill that will get digital currencies recognized as a \u201cpermissible investment\u201d under the Wyoming Money Transmitters Act, they will need to move quickly.Currently the group is working on legislative language with local attorneys and legislators. Next, they need to educate the citizens of Wyoming and the legislators about the benefits of Bitcoin and blockchain technologies. Some of that will involve webinars and live events, as as well as organizing a dinner in Cheyenne during the legislative session. \u00a0Last year, a similar regulatory effort, Wyoming House Bill 26, did not pass, but that was due to lack of knowledge and some \u201cunrelated political feuds,\u201d Robert Jennings, another one of the group\u2019s advisor members, told Bitcoin Magazine. This time around, he thinks \u201cblockchain [technology] and cryptocurrency will stand on its own merits.\u201d Jennings added, \u201cThere is already a groundswell of support in the state due to the rise in popularity of Bitcoin.\u201dBut, he cautioned, it will require \u201can extensive education campaign, which is why we formed the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 17}

This price peak bounced right off the upper linear ascending trendline shown in Figure 1. Historically, every time bitcoin has touched the upper ascending trendline, the market has gone through a corrective phase and entered into a relatively strong bearish reversal. At the time of this article, bitcoin is currently testing key, macro support of the lower $7,000 price range:Figure 2: BTC-USD, 1-Hour Candles, Macro SupportThe 23% Fibonacci support has been a point of interest in the market\u2019s history and will prove to be strong support. BTC-USD has attempted to break this support level a couple of times already and we are currently making a third test. A break below this level of support could send the price down to the 38% retracement values and test the $6,700 prices. However, if we look at the previous price action (the red circle) that brought the price upward, we don\u2019t see any consolidation or support in the market\u2019s history. This tells us that the 38% price level most likely won\u2019t prove to be significant support during a potential move downward and we can expect to find stronger support in lower values around the $6,400\u2013$6,500 prices.Historically, during correction periods, bitcoin has retraced 50\u201361% of the initial bull run:Figure 3: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, Retracement TrendThe 50\u201361% retracement trend has formed a very nice, consistent ascending trendline for the lower support values. Unfortunately in this case, a retracement to the lower trendline would shove us outside the parabolic envelope described in the last bitcoin market analysis. On a macro level, if we do continue on a macro retracement to the 50\u201361% retracement values, we will likely find support on the lower parabolic curve in the $5,300s. Overall, bitcoin appears to be experiencing a slow bleed and will likely continue until some buying pressure picks up on the market. In general, the bullish pressure is somewhat exhausted, and if there is a resumption of an uptrend, we will likely see support and bullish continuation off the 23% retracement and $6,500 values outlined in Figure 3.Right now, bitcoin is in a precarious situation because it\u2019s sitting just above support at the $7,000 level and doesn\u2019t appear to have any interest in climbing back up just yet. Keep an eye on this support level and watch for a rise in volume on the next test of support. If we break this support level, it\u2019s likely to continue downward for several hundred dollars before finding support once again.Summary:Bitcoin topped out its all-time high at the upper boundary of a macro, linear trendline.Historically, a test of this trendline has prompted a market correction \u2014 it is likely that this trend will continue.We are testing key support at the $7,000 price level and a move below this support will signal a continuation of the down trend.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nAlthough still in testing phase,\u00a0the\u00a0lightning network can now be used to send transactions across different blockchains. The Lightning Labs development team successfully swapped testnet bitcoin for testnet litecoin through a lightning channel this week: ownership of the coins changed hands, while no transaction was recorded on either blockchain.\u201cPrevious atomic swaps that I have done were on-chain, and had the on-chain limitations of slow [transactions] and high transaction fees,\u201d Litecoin creator Charlie Lee told Bitcoin Magazine, referring to an older trick to exchange different types of coins trustlessly. \u201cOff-chain atomic swaps are significantly better. They are instant, [have] low fees, and better protect one\u2019s privacy.\u201dThe successful test paves the way for trustless cryptocurrency exchanges, near-seamless multi-coin payment processors and more.Bitcoin and LitecoinThe lightning network is the highly anticipated second-layer payment network to be deployed on top of Bitcoin. And as an open protocol, it\u2019s relatively easy to deploy lightning network support for other cryptocurrencies that are forked from Bitcoin\u2019s codebase \u2014 like Litecoin.Interestingly, if the lightning network runs on different blockchains, these chains can effectively be linked together. If one or several peers on the network are willing to take one type of coin and forward another, it\u2019s possible to send bitcoins on one end of a channel that will end up as the equivalent in litecoin on the other end.In a Medium post published in the first week of 2017, Lee explained that this potential to create these kinds of \u201cbridges\u201d between cryptocurrencies made him throw his weight behind the Segregated Witness (SegWit) soft forks on both Litecoin and Bitcoin. When SegWit activated on Litecoin last spring, Lee\u2019s vision came one step closer to reality. Because the soft fork had not yet activated on Bitcoin at that time, Lightning Labs decided to add Litecoin support to their LND lightning network implementation. Thus, by the time SegWit activated on Bitcoin last summer, LND was already compatible with both chains.The testnet versions of these two blockchains are now made interoperable through the lightning network for the first time, allowing users to swap one type of coin for the other.\u201cThe primary advantages over previous solutions are speed, cost and privacy,\u201d Lightning Labs developer Conner Fromknecht told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cTransfers are more or less instant, and don\u2019t require the cost of an on-chain transaction. Additionally, in the cooperative case, the transactions are never broadcast, and leave no trace on the blockchain, offering privacy benefits. And with any luck, these privacy benefits will only continue to improve.\u201dThe Test (and the Potential)This week\u2019s specific test was done on a local machine, on which Fromknecht himself created two nodes: \u201cAlice\u201d and \u201cBob.\u201d These two nodes were modified to be able to monitor both the Bitcoin and Litecoin testnets. Fromknecht then created a single lightning channel that sent testnet litecoin from Alice to Bob and testnet bitcoin back from Bob to Alice at a fixed exchange rate. While still all in an experimental setting, the test was successful; Lightning Labs today published a blog post and a video detailing the results. In addition to offering a faster, cheaper and more private solution to exchanging coins, the successful test paves the way toward a whole new range of possibilities in the context of the lightning network. For example, peers on the network could eventually act as cryptocurrency exchanges, competing with one another to offer the best exchange rates.\u201cArguably the most important benefit of Lightning swaps is the ability to efficiently exchange different currencies without a custodian,\u201d Fromknecht said. \u201cOur ecosystem heavily depends on exchanges to fulfill this role today, but Lightning swaps offer users a choice to get the best of both worlds \u2014 instant exchanges without relinquishing control of your money.\u201dSimilarly, such exchangers could act as payment processors: it would be much easier for users to spend litecoin at merchants that only accept bitcoin (or vice versa). And it\u2019s even conceivable that bitcoin-to-bitcoin payments over the lightning network will route via Litecoin hubs, if that\u2019s the cheapest way to get funds from A to B. For Lee, at least, this is not as unlikely as it sounds, and the successful tests mark another step toward his vision for the lightning network on Litecoin and Bitcoin.\u201cThe Litecoin team is excited to work with Lightning Labs to explore the true potential of instant cross-chain atomic swaps,\u201d he concluded.For a more in-depth technical explanation of these kinds of atomic swaps, see our previous article \u201cAtomic Scaps: How the Lightning Network Extends to Altcoins\u201d or the blog post and video published by Lightning Labs today.", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 16}

As a result, mining operations bring benefits to those areas in terms of both employment and resource allocation.\u201d\u201cThe excess energy supply in certain regions is a big opportunity for mining worldwide,\u201d added Genesis Mining CEO and Co-Founder Marco Streng. \u201cWe see the positives of mining ranging from individuals to large organizations. Whether it is a hobby, someone\u2019s way to accumulate a certain cryptocurrency or a business with a profit motive, mining has been a positive endeavor for people all over the world. We look forward to growing the base of miners worldwide through promotion, education and new initiatives.\u201d\u201cThe formation of a partnership between BTC Inc. and Genesis Mining to create Genesis Engineering is important because it combines the leaders in the cryptocurrency information space and the cloud mining space to grow the industry in underserved markets at a time when crypto is in a position to be embraced by and benefit new markets,\u201d John Riggins, Head of Development for Eurasia at Genesis Engineering, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cGenesis Engineering will be positioned as a mining information leader, promoting the industry through workshops and consulting in developing regions. We see an energy landscape that includes excess and unused electricity in markets that could benefit from the introduction of a crypto mining industry in their economy as China has benefited over the last few years.\u201cThe crypto industry is in a growth stage and mining is a cornerstone of the industry that must grow in lock-step,\u201d added Riggins. \u201cMarkets with excess energy capacity are in a good position to benefit as the mining industry develops, benefiting local economies through job creation and energy utilization.\u201dRiggins noted that the market of the post\u2013Soviet Union is especially ripe for this sort of growth; therefore, Genesis Engineering will have a special focus in these countries. According to the company, these countries have the hallmarks of key regions for the development of cryptocurrency mining, including huge excess energy capacity, developed infrastructure and favorable climate conditions. For instance, oil producers in the region face an ecological tax on excess gases produced in oil excavation that is not put to use and is burned; this is gas that can be used to power mining facilities, create local jobs and make these countries regional leaders in the crypto industry.\u201cOn the information and promotion side, we will be opening the first of multiple showrooms and co-working spaces in November,\u201d Riggins said. \u201cThis facility will house a mining museum and will be used as a venue to promote the industry through workshops and a speaker series. On the consulting and mining business side, we are in negotiations with the largest electro energy production companies in the region, consulting on the positives of mining and the opportunity to use their spare capacity in these territories.\u201dGenesis Engineering will support the crypto mining industry broadly, including not only bitcoin but additional coins. It considers mining to be an important feature of the cryptocurrency sector, ensuring security and decentralization through incentives. The target market of Genesis Engineering ranges from hobbyists and small businesses reached by the company\u2019s showrooms, co-working spaces and speaker series, to multinational energy companies and large-scale miners reached by the company\u2019s consultancy and mining projects.Besides promotion of cryptocurrency mining and related consulting work, Genesis Engineering will offer cloud mining services through Genesis Mining, with an initial focus on markets that have been underserved in Eurasia. The pricing structure will be similar to Genesis Mining\u2019s current offering, but with a focus on making the service and mining equipment attractive in emerging markets, as well as to organizations that are interested in large-scale mining but have not yet entered the industry and will need to be led through that process.Persuaded that cryptocurrency mining can be a boon to energy suppliers and populations in these regions, \u201cGenesis Engineering will consider partnerships with energy providers and analyze how crypto mining could add value to different markets,\u201d concluded Riggins.", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 7}

Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean blocksize upgrade at this time.\u201dThe New York Agreement was originally forged between a group of Bitcoin companies in May of this year. An initiative by Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert, the project \u2014 later dubbed \u201cSegWit2x\u201d \u2014 was to combine activation of the Segregated Witness soft fork with a hard fork to double Bitcoin\u2019s block weight limit. With Segregated Witness activated on the Bitcoin network this past summer, arguably helped by the SegWit2x project, the hard fork was scheduled to take place next week.However, the hard fork part of the New York Agreement was always controversial for a number of reasons. As a result, a growing number of signatories dropped out of the agreement over the past weeks and months, while developers, user communities, public polls, future markets and more all indicated limited support for the effort. And as the hard fork date drew closer, it become increasingly clear that SegWit2x would in fact spawn a new currency rather than constitute an upgrade of the Bitcoin protocol.And this was never the plan, Belshe wrote:\u201cContinuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin\u2019s growth. This was never the goal of Segwit2x.\u201dBelshe\u2019s email was also signed on behalf of Xapo CEO Wences Casares, Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu, Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith and ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees. In a separate blog post published just before Belshe\u2019s email, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair also called for cancelation of the hard fork. While the New York Agreement was signed by even more companies (and some individuals), and anyone can still deploy the hard fork, it is unlikely that anyone will proceed with the hard fork in any meaningful way.Belshe does, however, note that a hard fork to increase Bitcoin\u2019s block weight limit might be needed in the future, writing:\u201cAs fees rise on the blockchain, we believe it will eventually become obvious that on-chain capacity increases are necessary. When that happens, we hope the community will come together and find a solution, possibly with a blocksize increase.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 8}

It aims to be the main stage for Bitcoin\u2019s technical and academic communities, with little room for commercial interests \u2014 and perhaps even less for the \u201cscaling drama\u201d that has grown to be the norm online.\u201cThis is the place where we want to focus on engineering, not politics,\u201d said Anton Yemelyanov, this year\u2019s planning committee chair, as he introduced the event on Saturday morning. \u201cWe want everyone to have objective discussions from an engineering standpoint.\u201dScaling Bitcoin Within the Scaling DebateScaling Bitcoin has a short but potent history.The first two conferences were hastily organized one after the other in the second half of 2015, both in direct response to the new-at-the-time block size limit dispute and a looming hard fork through Bitcoin XT. The Montreal edition, the first of the two conferences, was instrumental in bringing together Bitcoin\u2019s technical community, which had up until that point mostly communicated through chat channels and mailing lists. And the second edition in Hong Kong introduced Bitcoin\u2019s mostly Chinese mining community onto the stage for the first time, quite literally. Faced with a contentious hard fork, the events were instrumental in building community among developers and across continents.And the conferences proved pivotal in averting the crisis \u2014 at least temporarily. Hong Kong saw the introduction of Segregated Witness, presented by Blockstream engineer and major Bitcoin Core contributor Dr. Pieter Wuille. This innovation was included as a centerpiece in Bitcoin\u2019s scaling roadmap, proposed by Blockstream CTO and Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell right after the conference, and was endorsed by large parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It finally activated on the Bitcoin network this summer.Now, two years and three Scaling Bitcoin conferences after the Montreal edition, another controversial hard fork looms. BTC1 \u2014 maintained by former Bitcoin Core contributor and Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik \u2014 is scheduled to hard fork next week as per the New York Agreement in order to double Bitcoin\u2019s block weight limit \u2014 an effort dubbed \u201cSegWit2x.\u201dYet, this upcoming hard fork did not demand much attention in Stanford. Apart from subtle remarks buried throughout some of the talks, the topic of SegWit2x was almost completely absent from the Scaling Bitcoin program. Illustratively, Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC and one of the few outspoken SegWit2x proponents on stage, even refused to take any questions on the hard fork after his invited talk \u2014 instead focusing on Bitcoin\u2019s meteoric price rise over the past years.The Talks and the ScienceScaling Bitcoin instead continued on the path set out last year at the third event, hosted in Milan. With a broader scope than scaling alone, privacy and fungibility were prominent topics, while smart contracts, fees, mining and more were part of the program as well.Perhaps the biggest innovations presented throughout the weekend, at least within the realm of features that could feasibly be implemented on Bitcoin without rigorous protocol changes, were presented by some of the veterans (by now) in the space.Tadge Dryja, co-author of the lightning network white paper and currently employed by the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, presented \u201cDiscreet Log Contracts.\u201d If the math checks out like he thinks it does, these could effectively realize trustless oracle systems, arguably offering a superior (being simpler) alternative to the bulk of advanced smart contracts. Put bluntly, some think these kinds of solutions could make resource-intensive systems like Ethereum obsolete.Along similar conceptual lines, Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra presented \u201cscriptless scripts.\u201d Utilizing clever cryptography \u2014 specifically, signature aggregation \u2014 smart contracts could be anchored into a basic blockchain without needing to embed the entire smart contract code itself. Originally designed for the Mimblewimble protocol, the concept could be leveraged by Bitcoin, too.And speaking of veterans in the space, Nick Szabo \u2014 partnered with (among others) Bloomberg contributor Elaine Ou \u2014 presented his proposal to broadcast Bitcoin transactions over radio waves. Not so subtly referencing China\u2019s recent crackdown on Bitcoin, the two detailed how Bitcoin could travel around the globe (and over the great firewall of China) without so much as needing an internet connection.When the topic of Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit \u2014 the \u201coriginal\u201d scaling issue that spawned the conferences \u2014 came up at all, it was mostly in the context of propagation speed. Perhaps no coincidence, the two most relevant presentations on this topic were based on work by some of the people involved with previous hard fork attempts. The Bitcoin Unlimited team presented their test results on the \u201cGigablock\u201d network, which they believe safely supports blocks that exceed current limits by several orders of magnitude. And UMass Amherst professor Brian Levine presented the \u201cGraphene\u201d block propagation protocol, co-designed by Bitcoin\u2019s former lead developer Gavin Andresen.To the extent that next week\u2019s hard fork was discussed, Anthony Towns\u2019s presentation probably came closest. Towns detailed how support for future protocol changes could be cleverly determined through market dynamics. Though, while interesting, this type of solution will not be ready in time for the SegWit2x hard fork.The Hard Forks and the PoliticsIndeed, in contrast to some of the previous events, a sense of urgency was mostly absent in Stanford.This could be in part because most of Bitcoin\u2019s technical community has by now roughly settled on a path forward\u00a0\u2014 and SegWit2x is no part of it. Similarly, the question is not so much whether Bitcoin will scale predominantly through second layers; for them, at least, it will. Rather, topics of research now focus on how these second-layer technologies can be optimized for performance, privacy and more.Additionally, as a somewhat loosely organized volunteer effort, the team overseeing the conferences consists of slightly varying people from one event to the next. And resulting from a difference in vision for the 2017 edition, some of the earlier organizers as well as a segment\u00a0of Bitcoin\u2019s technical community\u00a0were absent for this round.Perhaps as a result, the sense of community building typical for some of the previous events was not as prominent in Stanford. And the question of how to deal with a looming\u00a0contentious hard fork was a more central topic at the similar but more informal Breaking Bitcoin conference in Paris several weeks ago. In little over two years, Scaling Bitcoin instead transformed from what is best described as an emergency summit to something perhaps more akin to a regular academic conference \u2014 even though an emergency summit would not have seemed entirely inappropriate at this point in time.For a complete overview and videos of all presentations, visit scalingbitcoin.com.

It then took an immediate $500\u2013$600 move downward and has, thus far, shown little interest in bouncing upward. Taking the whole move into view, we can see quite clearly that we completed a Wyckoff Distribution phase on the 30-minute candle; we are now heading downward as the supply is overwhelming the market:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 30-Minute Candles, Wyckoff Distribution\nFigure 1 shows a breakdown of the $7,000 support level, ultimately timed with the Last Point of Supply (LPSY) for this distribution phase. The LPSY represents the final, overwhelming abundance of supply in the market. As the price pushes lower, the supply outweighs the demand in the market and, as we are seeing in the current market, there is very little desire to buy at these prices. \nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro Parabolic Trend\nFigure 2 shows the rejection of the linear ascending resistance line (shown in pink). This trendline has historically proven to be a point of reversal and, at the time of the article, is rejecting the trendline for the fourth time. If we follow the correction trend, we can expect an ultimate test of the lower parabolic curve that has proven to be support over the course of the last two years.\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Fibonacci Retracement Set\nAs predicted in the previous bitcoin analysis, we are currently finding support along the 23% Fibonacci Retracement values in the lower $6,500s. Historically, these values haven\u2019t proven to be a significant market value, so I would not at all be surprised to see a test of the 38% values sometime soon. Figure 3 shows a lot of market activity and a well-established baseline of support in the 38% values. If the 23% values break and don\u2019t hold support, we can definitely expect strong support in the 38% values that will require multiple tests if it tries to break the 38% support.\nSummary:\nBitcoin broke below the $7,000 support level and ultimately completed a Wyckoff Distribution phase.Prior to the breakdown in price, the market rejected the historic resistance line, which has signaled a strong reversal point throughout the market\u2019s history.We are currently finding support on the 23% retracement values, but ultimately the stronger support will be found on the 38% values in the $5,800s.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

But what many people do not know is how perilous the blockchain journey ahead still is. We live in a world of smoke and mirrors; enterprise investors must do their due diligence in navigating these choppy waters \u2014 making the right investments in the right blockchain technologies to unlock that promised potential. To make the correct investments, we need to adopt a framework to evaluate them. Having a framework also means having the necessary inputs. What follows in this article are some of these key inputs.If you are considering making technology investments, think about the end state: your vision. How will this technology fit within your existing technology infrastructure? You need to put on your far- and short-sighted glasses: First, what will the near future (1\u20132 years) of the blockchain ecosystem look like? Second, how will this blockchain technology integrate with your existing infrastructure? Does it complement your technology investments thus far? Does it mitigate or add to any burdens in your existing technological landscape? All of these questions should inform your purchasing decision.As an integration consultant and a blockchain architect, my role is to help clients determine what is in the realm of possibility for them and what is not. Questions surrounding scalability, integration points, data interoperability and security are not easy questions to answer, but they must be considered. Some potential investors will be blinded by the sheer potential (or hype) of the technology and will completely ignore these realities. As appealing as blockchain technology is, it\u2019s not for everyone. Some enterprise investors are not at the maturity stage to adopt it yet, and this is not an easy pill to swallow.Blockchain is a nascent technology and much work is still being done in the areas of interoperability (e.g., ISO/TC 307, Ripple ILP, Hyperledger Quilt, etc.). These are challenges to consider. It is important to understand that, in order to realize the full potential of blockchain technology, some elements of integration with your legacy system are probably still going to be necessary. Consider also how your private blockchain can be integrated with public blockchains \u2014 we live in a less-than-perfect world where there are multiple blockchains. Will the blockchain be on cloud or on-premise? These are questions you\u2019ll need to answer; in fact, these very questions will also serve as inputs to your technology adoption framework.Bigger PictureAs blockchain technology speeds toward standardization (via International Standard Organization, etc.) and interoperability (Interledger Protocols, Hyperledger Quilt, etc.), we also need to ask ourselves if having too many standards will stifle innovation and whether integration and interoperability are antithetical to the core tenet of blockchain technology, which is decentralization, for which I have yet to find an answer.Finally, the benefits of interoperable and integrated blockchains are many: improved governance, interoperability, process automation, further cost savings and perhaps even cross-chain atomicity (a dream for now, at least). But we must not allow the benefits to blind us to the reality. I wish to end this article on a hopeful note. Despite the many challenges when it comes to adopting blockchain technology, these challenges are not unique to the blockchain. Every new piece of technology goes through phases of uncertainty and exploration: this one, too, shall pass.This is a guest post by Nathan Aw.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nAfter weeks of preparation,\u00a0Bitcoin Gold (Bgold; BTG) is finally launching tomorrow, \u00a0November 12, 2017.Bitcoin Gold is the second project to fork away from the Bitcoin blockchain to create a new coin this year; on August 1, Bitcoin Cash (Bcash) was the first. Where Bcash attempted to offer an on-chain scaling solution by increasing Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit (while removing the Segregated Witness code), Bgold is an attempt to counter Bitcoin\u2019s mining centralization.The most important difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Gold is a new proof-of-work mining algorithm. Instead of SHA256, the new coin uses the memory-hard Equihash proof-of-work function that\u2019s also used in the privacy-focused altcoin Zcash. This means that specialized ASIC hardware that has come to dominate Bitcoin\u2019s mining ecosystem will not be able to mine Bgold.Although Bgold is launching this weekend, the fork \u201cofficially\u201d occurred on October 25. Anyone who held bitcoin (BTC) on that day (specifically, when Bitcoin block 491406 was mined) will have an equivalent amount of BTG attributed to their private keys. These private keys can be imported into a dedicated Bgold wallet, which, starting tomorrow, will allow users to spend the coins. (But note that this does not come without risks and tradeoffs: If you\u2019re not sure what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s best not to ignore BTG until you do. For more information als see this article. Update, November 12th: There are now confirmed cases of malware disguised as Bgold wallets. Be extreme careful not to import your Bitcoin private keys into any software you don't fully trust!)Block 491407 on the Bgold blockchain will be the first block to deviate from the Bitcoin protocol. In other words, this will be the first block where Bgold splits off to become its own currency. However, somewhat controversially, the first 8000 blocks will be privately mined by the Bgold team. Only after these 8000 blocks will Bgold\u2019s mining difficulty ramp up to normal levels, and will anyone be allowed to mine the coin. The resulting 100,000 BTG worth of block rewards from the first 8000 blocks will fund project development and more. (For more details, see the Bitcoin Gold roadmap.)Other changes implemented by Bitcoin Gold are mostly to ensure a smooth split away from Bitcoin. This includes a new difficulty re-adjustment algorithm named \u201cDigiShield\u201d that adjusts the mining difficulty each time a block is found \u2014 instead of once every two weeks. Bgold also includes strong replay protection, ensuring that no users spend BTC when they mean to spend BTG, and vice versa. Additionally, BGold implemented a new address scheme, preventing users from spending BTC to BTG addresses and vice versa.Bitcoin Gold will be supported by a relatively large number of exchanges, including major players like Bitfinex, OKex and HitBTC. Several of these exchanges are effectively supporting BTC/BTG trading already through futures markets. Ignoring an initially inflated price, these futures have traded at around 0.02 BTC in recent weeks, with a notable surge to about 0.042 BTC at the time of writing this article. If this holds up, 1 BTG would be worth almost $250, and Bgold would immediately become a top-5 altcoin on websites like coinmarketcap.com.For more information on Bitcoin Gold, see Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s earlier article on this project.Disclaimer: The author of this article holds BTC and will therefore also own BTG at launch.", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 11}

He attributes his love-hate relationship with Abercrombie & Fitch and inspiration for his writing to a unique blend of experiences in Russia, Hungary, Spain and the United States. Erik is interested in middlemen-less economics, and is a managing partner at Tapas Capital.\nAfter an unidentified actor \u201caccidentally\u201d triggered a series of bugs that destroyed approximately $150 million worth of digital currency, the world waits for a substantive answer \u2014 is this vulnerability an anomaly? An \u201cI told you so\u201d? Or a humbling opportunity to secure the Ethereum network?What Happened?On November 6, \u201cDevops199,\u201d an alleged amateur programmer, set off a chain of bugs on Parity, a popular digital wallet for Ethereum. These bugs affected multisignature, or \u201cmultisig,\u201d accounts \u2014 \u201cwallets\u201d\u00a0that require multiple users to\u00a0sign off with their\u00a0keys before funds can be transferred.. The place these wallets connect to is known as a \u201clibrary\u201d contract.According to Parity, an attempt to fix a vulnerability that allowed hackers to steal $32 million from multisignature wallets in July of 2017 inadvertently created a second vulnerability in the library contract. This allowed Devops199\u00a0gain\u00a0sole ownership of the library that every multisignature wallet used for their code.After Devops199 realized what had happened, he \u201ckilled\u201d (deleted) the code. Unfortunately, this locked all funds into multisignature wallets permanently, with no way to access them.Because of the functionality of the current blockchain, $150 million worth of ether (ETH), the tradable currency that fuels the Ethereum platform, is now effectively destroyed and inaccessible to anyone. Among the victims of this bug are several recently successful ICOs that chose to store their funds in a Parity wallet because of its multisig option and compatibility with various hardware wallets.Parity\u2019s Response (So Far)On November 7, tweets on Parity\u2019s official Twitter account acknowledged the vulnerability and confirmed that the funds affected are frozen and can\u2019t be moved anywhere. A day later, on November 8, Parity de-briefed the bug, explaining that it was indeed possible to turn the Parity Wallet Library contract into a regular multisig wallet and become the owner of it, which is exactly what Devops199 did. Parity now has a tool to check if a user/wallet has been affected by the vulnerability.Parity\u2019s History of HacksThis isn\u2019t the first time Parity has fallen victim to a security exploit. Parity\u2019s multisignature contracts were previously the target of three thefts totalling 150,000 ether in July of 2017 (the second-largest hack after the DAO fiasco). And losses could have been exponentially higher. However, the \u201cWhite Hat Group,\u201d a collection of hackers and activists, was able to intervene and drain the majority of other wallets before they could be compromised as well. Future multi-sig wallets created in all versions of Parity Wallet have no known exploits.\u00a0- Official Parity website post following the July 19 hackJeff Coleman, an expert in blockchain technologies and currently a researcher and advisor with L4 Ventures, described Parity\u2019s response to the July 19, 2017, attack as having been \u201cworrying, to say the least.\u201d Coleman told Bitcoin Magazine that his primary concerns centered around Parity\u2019s inadequate response and its tendency to downplay the significance of the compromise, choosing instead to blame a large number of external causes:They blamed observers for not finding the bug before it was exploited; they blamed lack of incentivization for observers; and they blamed the Solidity language for not blocking access by default to the functions the [Parity team] failed to protect.He further noted that Parity seemed to be blaming the complexity of the well-audited wallet (which they still believed to be secure) from which they had originally modified their code. And also that Parity didn\u2019t take responsibility for their own inadequate quality control and audit procedures.S.O.S.? Developers in the community are desperately trying to find a fix to the Parity predicament. Coleman believes that \u201cfrom a technological perspective, there is nothing short of a hard fork [a non-backward-compatible change to the Ethereum protocol] to restore the destroyed funds.\u201dAfter the DAO hack in 2016, the Ethereum Foundation had already accepted a hard fork to restore lost funds, with the common understanding that this was a sort of \u201cmulligan\u201d \u2014 a one-time fix for a young, developing blockchain. This scenario, nevertheless, divided the Ethereum blockchain into two parts and created Ethereum Classic, the original Ethereum blockchain, backed by a community that vehemently opposes editing transaction history to restore lost funds.Using hard forks as interventions to \u201ccorrect\u201d worst-case scenarios like this is highly controversial, especially since blockchains are meant to be immutable. So, it\u2019s difficult to convince the Ethereum community to use a hard fork to rescue one team from a mistake. While many acknowledge sympathy for smaller accounts storing personal ETH, sentiment is not as sympathetic for the 300,000 ETH that belonged to the Polkadot Project,\u00a0project associated with the Parity team.Arseny Reutov, an application security researcher for blockchain security firm positive.com, affirmed this community sentiment, while acknowledging that hard forks can be solutions. However, he agrees that Ethereum cannot simply hard fork any time there is a problem on the network. He believes blockchains should expect \u201cmore and more high profile thefts and incidents,\u201d and that the problem lies in the infant Ethereum platform itself \u2014 specifically, in the native Solidity programming language. If a Hard Fork Isn\u2019t the Answer, Then What Is?Both Coleman and Reutov believe that the key to gaining the community support necessary to restore funds is to combine the Parity situation with similar situations in which funds have been lost due to various kinds of mistakes. As an example, Coleman referenced those detailed in EIP 156: \u201cReclaiming of ether in common classes of stuck accounts.\u201dColeman also pointed out that in any of these instances, it must be \u201ccompletely unambiguous who the original owners of the assets were.\u201d The necessary changes could then be made and packaged together in an \u201calready planned hard fork, such as the upcoming Constantinople fork.\u201dEven so, restoring funds is problematic. Ethereum core developers must discern which mistake-affected funds will be returned to users. Will all funds be returned or only a select few \u2014 or will this be a ~500,000 ETH learning experience?", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 10}

We\u2019re excited that we have been able to create a suitable environment for this internal innovation.\u201dKaspersky Lab released a beta version of Polys, intended to get early feedback and iteratively develop an operational voting system that, according to the company, \u201cwill change the way people vote.\u201dAt the moment, Polys offers a free web-based dashboard to create an online vote with two options: majority vote, in which the option that gets the majority of votes wins, and cumulative vote, in which the voter has multiple votes that can be given to a single option or divided among several options. Cumulative voting is often used, for example, for committee elections where voters can support more than one candidate.Once a vote has been created on the Polys dashboard, the administrators can choose how to accept votes. Currently supported options are email, unique codes, and public voting. In email voting, Polys sends an email to each voter with a secure voting link. In public voting, the voting link is open to everyone who can view it. A combination of online and offline voting can be implemented with secure codes, generated by Polys and sent to users in electronic or printed format, which enable users to vote using either personal devices or public computers in voting kiosks. Polys will support a desktop app to create a vote and a mobile app to actually vote. Besides the free dashboard, Polys offers a paid version that supports white-labeling, re-branding and integration options.According to Kaspersky Lab, a robust voting system should ensure voter anonymity, provide protection against trash votes, vote trafficking and voter coercion, and enable voters to check that their votes have been recorded in the blockchain. It\u2019s also important to encrypt the voting results recorded in the blockchain, otherwise intermediate results could become available before voting ends, which is often against the law.For now, votes can\u2019t be changed by Polys or by the voters, but a Polys white paper suggests countering the threats of vote trafficking and coerced voting by enabling voters to change their votes without limitation.The source code of Polys, based on Ethereum smart contracts, will be made available on GitHub. Cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab is leading Polys\u2019s security development; \u00a0Parity Technologies, a company specialized in blockchain and peer-to-peer software for the decentralized web, will support the project\u2019s blockchain development.\u201cParity Technologies is excited to be involved with Polys as their platform of choice for such an innovative project,\u201d said Jutta Steiner, co-founder of Parity Technologies. \u201cBlockchain [technology] is increasingly being implemented by a vast number of industries, and we believe that decentralizing the voting procedure will ensure a fair process and create a high level of trust in the system.\u201dKaspersky Lab proposes two typical use cases for Polys: early-adopting environments such as universities, where students and faculty will be able to informally vote for classes and student councils, and tech-oriented \u201cfuture cities\u201d that need new solutions for conducting formal elections with speed, reliability and trust.It seems likely that blockchain-based online voting systems, including but not limited to Polys, will first find operational applications for informal, non-binding consultative voting in academia and similar environments. It\u2019s worth noting that Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), which can often be considered as demonstrators of future governance methods, have built-in voting systems based on blockchain technology, often implemented with Ethereum smart contracts.Therefore, it seems plausible that blockchain-based voting could move to the \u201creal\u201d world of cities and governments. Once blockchain-based voting systems are able to demonstrate watertight security, they could address the challenge of counting errors and fraud in elections. It\u2019s also worth noting that, while blockchain voting has its delays and costs, it could be much faster and cheaper than traditional voting systems. Blockchain voting could enable governments to implement direct democracy with frequent consultations on a wide range of political and social issues.", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 14}

According to Tetra\u2019s blog post announcement, however, it appears that its approach is at odds with this philosophy: Tetra understands the importance of practices like KYC and has devoted the resources necessary to implement these processes properly. Users will be able to trade safely with the comfort of knowing that due diligence has been enacted to protect them from potential repercussions.\u201cYou may have heard the terrifying accounts of people receiving prison sentences for trading cryptocurrencies on peer-to-peer exchanges,\u201d adds the main Tetra website. \u201cWith Tetra, that is a thing of the past. Route your payments through our fully compliant banking network for a legally sound trading process. We're relieving traders of the burden of obtaining expensive licenses and adhering to cumbersome regulations in order to allow people to focus on what matters: their trades.\u201dWhile this sounds appealing to compliance-conscious cryptocurrency users and traders, the self-description of Tetra as a \u201csemi-decentralized P2P\u201d raises questions. In a Reddit discussion, a Tetra representative admits that Tetra is a centralized service, but states that the exchange operates using a decentralized transaction model so that the operators never have control over users\u2019 coins directly, and thus hackers do not have access to users\u2019 coins.In communication with Bitcoin Magazine, Patrick O'Brien and CTO of Tetra Exchange, confirmed this practice.\"Tetra is called a semi-decentralized exchange because Tetra customers maintain control over their own private keys. Customer funds are never stored on our centralized servers, users store their funds in their own client-side wallets which are built into the Tetra software, and transact through our system by utilizing the Bitcoin network's multi-signature transaction architecture.\u201dHe explained that Tetra is described as a peer-to-peer exchange because users are trading with other individuals, and not with Tetra or against a Tetra orderbook as they would in a traditional exchange.\u201cTo elaborate further, this means that when customers are interested in making escrow payments they will participate in a multi-signature transaction, with the third party and ourselves as signing authorities,\u201d continued O'Brien. \u201cIn the event of a dispute we can co-operate with either side to move the funds where they need to go, and in the event of a successful transaction both sides can agree to release the funds. All of this is accomplished without us ever having direct control over the flow of money as would be the case in a traditional exchange.\u201dInternational Compliance IssuesBased in British Columbia, Canada, Tetra plans to operate globally with no restrictions, unless forced to by law. When a Reddit user suggested that Tetra is advising traders to flaunt U.S. money transmission laws, the Tetra representative answered that the exchange is not \u201cignoring U.S. laws and pretending it's Canadian law while intending to operate in the U.S.\u201d He added that the exchange takes compliance very seriously and stated that Tetra is circling back to their lawyers for advice.However, as the Reddit thread continues to point out, there still remains a number of compliance and personal privacy concerns related to the company\u2019s KYC measures that U.S. users should be especially wary of, depending on the particular state requirements where they live.Some states are stricter than others, too. Always [know] one's own jurisdictional rules/laws and not rely on what is \"too good to be true.\" - coin_trader_LBCUser Experience and SecurityLeaving aside the P2P interpretation and the potential compliance minefield, it\u2019s worth noting that Tetra emphasizes easy usability and security as strong competitive advantages in the cryptocurrency exchange market. \u201c[The] Tetra app and web platform will create a simple experience for users,\u201d reads the announcement, adding that users won\u2019t need to know about public key cryptography and smart contracts. \u201cThis approach will enable a new generation of users to enter the cryptocurrency space and with that bring new investors, new clients for dapps and crypto-based businesses, and in general make a great stride towards mainstream adoption that will enable the positioning of cryptocurrencies as true world-currencies.\u201dThe Tetra platform uses multisig escrow and intends to automate all aspects of the trading process to provide \u201cincredibly secure and worry-free trading\u201d with 2-of-2 and 2-of-3 P2SH multi-signature transactions, smart contracts and encryption of all communications.Of course, Tetra is hardly the only exchange to focus on easy usability and security, and, in fact similar measures are adopted by many exchanges today. What really seems to differentiate Tetra from many other exchanges is the fact that Tetra is explicitly targeting professional traders and cryptocurrency trading businesses that need to streamline multiple trades, by offering an easy user experience to their customers and presenting themselves as fully compliant with regulations.\"The goal here is to facilitate the growth of fiat to crypto on-ramps and off-ramps, and we do this by encouraging people to operate trading businesses on our platform,\" O'Brien told Bitcoin Magazine.\u201cThe features outlined so far culminate to satisfy business needs; by ensuring customers have a completely secure, legally safe, and easy to use platform Tetra will allow businesses to thrive in an otherwise hostile environment,\u201d concludes the announcement.The first public release of the Tetra platform and apps, currently available to alpha testers, will support Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Dash. Other cryptocurrencies that support multisig transactions are planned for the future. The platform will begin its roll out in the U.S., Canada and Australia.To professional traders and businesses, Tetra offers a paid service dubbed Tetra Prime, with support for online and \u201cbrick-and-mortar\u201d business storefronts, as well as trade matching and analytics to optimize trading profiles.", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 15}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe hard fork part of the New York Agreement is scheduled to take place within about two weeks. This incompatible protocol rule change is set to increase Bitcoin\u2019s block weight limit, to allow for more transactions on the network \u2014 if everyone adopts the change. Otherwise, it will create a new blockchain and currency that may or may not be considered to be \u201cBitcoin.\u201dThe list of signatories of this agreement includes several of the largest Bitcoin startups and mining pools that, together, claim to represent a majority of users and hash power. Yet, it is far from clear that this 2x part of SegWit2x proposal really has much support outside of these signatories. Most of Bitcoin\u2019s development community, a significant number of other companies, some mining pools, user polls as well as futures markets suggest otherwise.And now, a growing list of international Bitcoin communities is putting out public statements against the SegWit2x hard fork as well.An overview\u2026Seoul Bitcoin MeetupOn October 12, 2017, the Seoul Bitcoin Meetup \u2014 the largest and longest-running Bitcoin meetup in South Korea with over 1700 members \u2014 was the first user community to put out a statement on SegWit2x. More precisely, in their own words, the group voiced its \u201cstaunch opposition to this November\u2019s proposed hardfork.\u201dIn its statement, the Seoul Bitcoin Meetup places emphasis on the manner in which the agreement was made. Typically, changes to the Bitcoin protocol go through the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process where it is peer reviewed by developers across the ecosystem, whereas SegWit2x went through the New York Agreement, which was forged at an invite-only meeting among about a dozen company executives.The Seoul Meetup states:If a select group of CEOs and investors, no matter how benevolent their intentions, can unilaterally make decisions about the consensus rules without public comment and force these changes upon the network regardless of overall consensus, then Bitcoin will have lost the properties that make it valuable in the first place.Additionally, the Seoul Bitcoin Meetup argues that the hard fork is needlessly risky without offering sufficient benefits to warrant the risk. It also takes issue with the controversial decision of SegWit2x developers not to implement strong replay protection.Bitcoin Meetup MunichOn the same day as the Seoul Meetup Group, the Bitcoin Munich meetup group also put out a public statement against the SegWit2x hard fork. This meetup group consists of over 2000 members \u2014 though only several dozen of them actually engaged in the vote whether or not the statement against the SegWit2x hard fork would be accepted. This statement itself was spread via photo on social media.In its statement, the Bitcoin Munich meetup explains it opposes the SegWit2x hard fork in part because of technical concerns: Another doubling of the block size so quickly after SegWit seems hasty and might cause further mining centralization. The statement further argues that a hard fork requires more and better preparation and should include more improvements from the hard fork wish list, and it endorses Bitcoin Core as \u201cthe true Bitcoin client.\u201dBrazilian and Argentinian Bitcoin CommunitiesThe biggest user community also published the longest statement against the SegWit2x hard fork so far. A combined effort between a significant group of Argentinian and Brazilian users and companies, published on October 17,2017, voiced \u201ctheir deepest concerns over the upcoming November hardfork as mandated by the so-called New York Agreement (NYA), also known as SegWit2x (S2X).\u201dNot unlike other critics of the hard fork, emphasis was placed on the process that led to the SegWit2x agreement:The very nature of an \u2018agreement\u2019 between a few parties in a decentralized consensus protocol can be interpreted as an aggression against the network.Similarly, the statement addresses the lack of transparency from SegWit2x proponents, criticizing the notion of a \u201cpolitical compromise instead of a technical upgrade\u201d and the \u201cconsensus imposition instead of consensus building.\u201dOther points of concern include the lack of replay protection, the rushed nature of the hard fork, misleading statements by SegWit2x proponents and much more.Israeli Bitcoin AssociationThe Israeli Bitcoin Association is a non-profit organization that promotes Bitcoin and similar technologies in Israel, with an open membership. On October 24, 2017, this association put out its own statement on the SegWit2x hard fork.Slightly different from several of the other statements, the Israeli Bitcoin Association emphasizes the right of anyone to fork Bitcoin and create a new cryptocurrency. That naturally includes SegWit2x proponents.But importantly, the association adds: A protocol change in the currency holding the name \u2018Bitcoin\u2019, especially one requiring a hard fork, requires overwhelming consensus. The SegWit2x hard fork does not in any way enjoy such consensus, and while this remains the case we cannot refer to the resulting currency as \u2018Bitcoin.\u2019The SegWit2x currency will instead be referred to as \u201c\u2018Bitcoin2x.\u2019 \u2018SegWit2x coins,\u2019 BT2, B2X, S2X or any other distinctive term that the industry will adopt.\u201dThe Hong Kong Bitcoin Community / Bitcoin Association of Hong KongThe Hong Kong Bitcoin Community in general, and the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong specifically, put out statements against SegWit2x on October 25, 2017.While technically separate statements, both voice their concern about the lack of consensus for the hard fork. The Hong Kong Bitcoin Community \u2014 a group of Hong Kong\u2013based companies \u2014 states that \u201cthe lack of enthusiastic support for this fork among the community is striking.\u201d The association \u2014 which mostly exists to promote Bitcoin in Hong Kong \u2014 states that \u201cthe proponents of the hardfork should kindly ask the Bitcoin community to support them and then only proceed with the hardfork if there is widespread community support.\u201dAdditionally, the Hong Kong groups speak out against the lack of replay protection in the SegWit2x fork.Due to the combination of both a lack of consensus across the community and a lack of strong replay protection, we consider SegWit2x a reckless endeavor that will cause disruption and harm to the ecosystem.The Italian Bitcoin CommunityThe Italian Bitcoin community, more specifically a group of companies, meetups, lobbying groups and other organizations, put out a statement against SegWit2x on October 31, 2017.The statement is largely inspired by an earlier statement by the Italian blockchain research lab BHB, which rejected SegWit2x as \u201can attempt to perform a political takeover of Bitcoin.\u201dThe statement by the broader Italian Bitcoin community is a bit more compact, but nonetheless touches on many of the familiar points of criticism regarding the SegWit2x hard fork.It reads:The opposition is especially strong against any action of this kind that could cause huge inconveniences for service providers and serious confusion for users, potentially leading to financial losses: unilateral attempts to appropriate Bitcoin name, logo or \u201cticker\u201d, attempts to mislead light-clients and SPV wallets on alternative networks not explicitly chosen by them, attempts to launch new coins in a way which leave users vulnerable to \u201creplay attacks\u201d or address format confusion, attempts to attack the network with a temporary hashing-power majority in order to create disruptive reorgs or to slow down the normal activity.French-Speaking Bitcoin CommunitiesMeanwhile, the French-speaking Bitcoin communities are voicing their concerns with the SegWit2x hard fork through a change.org petition. It is currently signed by over 1300 people and counting.The (French) text that accompanies the petition is mostly inspired by and based on the statement published by the Seoul Bitcoin Meetup. Like that statement, this petition emphasizes concerns about the manner in which the agreement was forged, while also noting the lack of replay protection and other problems.Additionally, the petition includes a call to action to find alternatives for the companies that signed onto and continue to support the SegWit2x hard fork:We would suggest avoiding the use of services of companies that support the NYA, and we hope to substitute them with alternative solutions.Update, November 2nd: On October 31st, the meetup group and open educational effort for Bitcoin in Manchester (UK), Bitcoin Manchester, issued a\u00a0statement against the SegWit2x hard fork as well.Are they any more user communities that have put out statements against or in favor of the SegWit2x hard fork?

I believe that using blockchain technology, you too will contribute to the writing of a new Slovenian success story.\u201dThe first clear signal that the government was prepared to make some serious moves was during July\u2019s Blockchain Meetup Slovenia 2017, which hosted more than 300 blockchain enthusiasts. Since then, Slovenia has made significant strides in its efforts to become the EU\u2019s key blockchain-friendly destination. Prime Minister Miro Cerar\u2019s recognition of Slovenia\u2019s blockchain community as involving some of the globally leading developers and entrepreneurs shows the willingness of politicians and regulators at the highest level to understand these opportunities and act quickly. Indeed, five months mean little in the typical context of government and regulation. Step by step, the distributed economy is becoming a true alternative to centralized systems. The new and ever-arising services are boundless, and go far beyond Bitcoin and into the fields of banking, insurance, new models of creating and sharing content, and more. This globally connected ecosystem already has a market valuation in excess of \u20ac140 billion ($163 billion USD). At the core of a decentralized future is the persistent issue of blockchain regulation. Historically, the law has struggled to keep up with revolutionary technology. As Slovenia\u2019s president, Borut Pahor, also emphasized this week, the age-old question for regulators remains: How can we protect citizens without stifling technological innovation? This is a particularly important question for the country from which the most significant EU blockchain companies originate, including ICONOMI, Cofound.it and Bitstamp, and the country with the highest market capitalization per capita of blockchain projects. We believe that self-regulation, education and raising awareness are important steps toward a safe and innovative business environment. To address regulatory challenges, Cofound.it, together with blockchain legal specialist Nejc Novak, founder of law firm Novak Rutar, has spent the past five months working intensively with a diverse range of stakeholders, including the Cabinet of the Prime Minister, the Securities Agency, the Financial Administration, the Office for Money Laundering Prevention, the Central Bank, the Ministry of Public Administration and the Ministry of Finance, to clarify a number of key legal uncertainties. As a result, Cofound.it, in partnership with Rutar, is now able to provide robust legal advice to blockchain projects so that entrepreneurs can focus on their products and their user communities, rather than on accounting, compliance and other operational issues. Slovenian entrepreneurs were early movers in the blockchain industry, and Slovenian blockchain specialists are well-placed to facilitate a workable legal framework for national, European and even global blockchain regulation. Today, Ljubljana is a vibrant market of developers, advisers, investors and savvy businesspeople with some of the most in-depth knowledge and understanding of blockchain technology in the world. The Slovenian blockchain community is already making leaps and bounds toward a regulatory framework. DataFund, a personal data management solution, will launch later this year in partnership with Cofound.it. This local project is a first example of blockchain utilization and in compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The prime minister\u2019s acknowledgment of Slovenia\u2019s advancements in blockchain technology is a welcome move toward wider policy discussions within a rapidly expanding industry. By making some wise and future-focused strategic decisions, Slovenia is already well on its way to becoming one of the most desirable destinations for global blockchain startups.This is a guest post by Zenel Batagelj,\u00a0Co-Founder and Head of Team Strategy at Cofound.it.

He attributes his love-hate relationship with Abercrombie & Fitch and inspiration for his writing to a unique blend of experiences in Russia, Hungary, Spain and the United States. Erik is interested in middlemen-less economics, and is a managing partner at Tapas Capital.\nOn October 27, 2017, disruptors in the cryptocurrency field gathered at the San Francisco Ethereal Summit.\u00a0Sponsored by ConsenSys,\u00a0the summit provided a diverse mix of panels and workshops that demystified the \u201cinitial coin offering\u201d (ICO) or \u201ctoken generation event.\u201dSide note: Vernacular is key. Referring to a token launch as an ICO is so\u00a0\"September.\" The process is now referred to as a \u201ctoken generation event.\u201d At the \u201cHow to Launch a Token\u201d panel, token generation event veterans Galia Benartzi (co-founder of Bancor Protocol), Matt Liston (CSO at Gnosis) and Piotr Janiuk (co-founder and CTO of the Golem Project) guided Ethereal participants through a hypothetical: founding a hat company and funding the development through a token. Here are some of the key points that they discussed.Step 1: Determine if the token model fits for the new company Imagine the whole process backward: What layer does the company involve \u2014 application, platform or protocol? Design the decentralized concept first and then discern if a token is necessary.Criteria:Is the project based on a decentralized model? If not, equity funding is a viable option \u2013\u2013 no need for a token.What is the token\u2019s utility within the network? How are customers involved in the network? For example, is the token facilitating and incentivizing collaboration between the community in the network? If so, tokens (similar to shares and equity in a normal company) are a great way to distribute participation among stakeholders.Tokens work best when fueling network effects around ideas \u2013\u2013 when there are benefits to being an early adapter/stakeholder. Step 2: Find a strong legal team and a favorable regulatory environmentRegulation in the cryptocurrency space is in its infancy and varies greatly around the world.Criteria: Find a competent lawyer with an understanding of the space that can give risk parameters. It is important to minimize risk for the project.Select a government that defines clear boundaries and has a forward-thinking mentality.Although blockchains and cryptocurrency promise decentralized disruption to all industries, anarchy would be unfavorable to all. All companies must comply with the law.Step 3: \u00a0Work on the prototype phase Establish a white paper, set up the concept on the testnet and prove the concept.Criteria:White paper: describe your network, protocol and model. White papers should strike the proper balance between being math-heavy and marketing-heavy. The goal is for users and stakeholders to understand exactly what the network is doing.Prove that your concept works and expose its source code. Everything should be 100 percent transparent to the public.Trustless (trust forced through code) and transparent networks are critical to long-term success. Secure and validate data by rewarding \u201coracles,\u201d people who provide trustworthy answers and validate that events did in fact occur. On the flip side, penalize those who lie to the network.Trust and transparency are paramount for any company that is considering funding its development with a token. Step 4: Connect with the communityGenerating interest for the token and setting the foundation for strong community support before finally launching a token generation event to the public is crucial.Criteria:Develop a public-relation strategy. Share as much as possible. Post videos, host AMAs, etc. This process can be grueling, but it is necessary to establish a global presence and field questions. Prepare for a fast-paced environment. Communication builds authenticity and credibility with supporters around the world.Listen to outside perspectives and criticisms.Because token generation events allow for decentralized methods of funding, the company\u2019s diligence process should be decentralized to match. Tokens generation events are complicated and don\u2019t work for every business type. However, they unlock a new economic driver: permissionless venture capital.", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 31}

A key goal of SingularityNET is to ensure the technology is benevolent according to human standards, and the network is being designed to incentivize and reward beneficial players. The startup is developing interoperability standards for AIs, which could radically improve the process of discovering and coordinating AI services, while allowing developers to easily monetize AI technology.SingularityNET positions itself both as a critical mediator across all future AI developments, as well as a hub for free and open AI technologies owned by the crowd, where anyone can acquire or monetize AI services. Blockchain-based smart contracts will be central to SingularityNET operations, allowing users to combine multiple AI technologies to create custom AI stacks. The initial implementation of SingularityNET will be built on Ethereum, with smart contracts written in Solidity.\u201cAI is currently very fragmented and narrowly trained,\u201d Simone Giacomelli, founder of Vulpem and co-founder of SingularityNET, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBlockchain technology and smart contracts make economic collaboration over the internet easier than ever before, aligning incentives mechanisms for different AIs to be optimized as one. SingularityNET leverages this collaborative power to make AI work together.\u201dSingularityNET is the brainchild of AI researcher Ben Goertzel and robotics designer David Hanson, founder of Hanson Robotics. The robot Sophia, developed by Hanson Robotics, attracted media attention when it was recently granted citizenship in Saudi Arabia. While the SingularityNET project is still partly in stealth mode, it has been presented at recent blockchain events, including Wired\u2019s Nextfest in Italy, SWITCH Singapore and the World Blockchain Forum in London.At the recent Ethereal Summit in San Francisco, Goertzel showcased Sophia to demonstrate the power of AI and the potential of incorporating AI and blockchain technology to create a decentralized, open-source, blockchain-powered AI network that operates like, and can be thought of as, a thinking brain.While on the SingularityNET roadshow, Goertzel is taking time from his busy schedule to write a series of posts on SingularityNET. \u201cSingularityNET is intended as a platform in which an AGI [Artificial General Intelligence] can emerge from the combination of multiple humans and multiple human-created software programs, possessing varying degrees of general intelligence on their own,\u201d Goertzel told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt doesn't eliminate the need for fundamental algorithmic work on AGI reasoning and learning and memory, but it provides a context in which such algorithmic work can have a rapid, transformative impact.\u201dGoertzel makes a distinction between narrow AI and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While narrow AI programs are finding applications in a growing range of industries, they are not effectively integrated into overall AGI systems with general-purpose intelligence like that of humans. Therefore, Goertzel is persuaded that the next big step in the evolution of AI is going to be the transition from AI to AGI. SingularityNET wants to support this transition with an open market in which various AI algorithms can cooperate and form new patterns of emergent intelligence.\u201cThe actual design that has been formulated is a quite practical system that is being implemented in quality software code and will serve real corporate customers and become a large and lucrative business,\u201d continued Goertzel. \u201cBut at the deepest level, the underlying philosophical and emotional motivations David Hanson and I had for creating SingularityNET, are transhumanist ones.\u201dGoertzel and Hanson are, in fact, among the leading advocates of transhumanism, defined as the prospect of using advanced technology to radically change, hopefully for the better, the human condition. Enabling transhumanist technologies would include life extension, uploading human minds to futuristic supercomputers, and sentient AGI way smarter than humans, which is the target of SingularityNET. In his 2010 book A Cosmist Manifesto, which blends transhumanist technology and enlightened spirituality, Goertzel proposed a practical philosophy able to inform the next phases of human history and transhumanist evolution.Ultimately, Goertzel wants to create \u201ca massively transhuman, overwhelmingly beneficial Ubermind\u201d that evolves and grows continuously out of human mind and culture. \u201cOne way to achieve this would be to via brain-computer interfacing \u2014 and this is going to happen,\u201d Goertzel told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cOf course the computer portion of cyborgs made with brain-computer interfaces will jack into this emerging AGI society, economy and culture as well, and then we will get a supermind.\u201d\u201cThis emerging supermind, as it grows, will provide ways for people to earn a living and sometimes even generate tremendous wealth, as part of its growth process,\u201d concluded Goertzel. \u201cAnd it will donate parts of its resources to the common good of all humans, including underprivileged ones, as a way of helping drive its growth forward toward its objectives of joy, growth and choice.\u201dGoertzel shared with Bitcoin Magazine parts of the draft SingularityNET white paper, a living document still under tight wraps.\u201cA blockchain-based framework designed to serve the needs of AI agents as they interact with each other and with external customers can enable the emergence of a collective intelligence,\u201d notes the draft white paper. \u201cThe use of cryptocurrency and blockchain for AI services provides a number of advantages. It allows AI agents to exchange work and subcontract with a high degree of flexibility, and also enables AI-based microservices to be offered to any customer via easily accessible APIs (enabled by smart contracts under the hood).\u201dGoertzel, Hanson and the SingularityNET team want to balance long-term visionary thinking with practical market needs and business concerns. In their view, the platform could enable AIs to learn from each other and collaborate, which would be one of the biggest breakthroughs ever in the evolution of AI, causing a subsequent impact on the global AI market, which is projected to grow from $233.8 billion in 2017 to $3.1 trillion in 2025.\u201cFrom day one, SingularityNET will offer AI agents,\u201d continues the white paper. \u201cThe open design of the network, and the economic incentives, should then encourage additional AI developers to add their own AI nodes via the SingularityNET API.\u201d While many nodes will run on powerful supercomputers in the cloud, others will be embedded in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and humanoid robots like Sophia will be supplied with on-board SingularityNET nodes. The upcoming SingularityNET token, details of which haven\u2019t been disclosed yet, will play a central role in the network\u2019s operations.The project is about to launch an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) to fund the full development of its platform, to be fully deployed in 2018. \u201cThis ICO will allow us to start with a bang,\u201d said Goertzel. \u201cWe'll be competing with Google and Facebook...so having a war chest would allow us to take on them more easily.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 31}

Uber-secure cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, use the same type of verification systems.A simple example is this: If Party A pays a certain amount and the payment is verified, then the title to Party B's property is automatically released to Party A and can be automatically updated with correct ownership information. These smart contracts are extremely tempting. They could easily increase the efficiency of your business, as well as save money that previously went to third parties. Smart contracts are becoming more popular in segments such as real estate, healthcare and securities, primarily due to these potential gains in efficiency and cost. However, this silver bullet of efficiency and lower cost doesn't come without potential problems. First, will a court even consider a computer program to be a binding contract? Second, if disputes arise, where can the parties sue? Last, do the parties have to go to court, or is the less-expensive option of arbitration available?Offer/Acceptance: Is It Even a Binding Contract?Typically, contracts are binding and enforceable under the law if the required legal process is followed. One side makes an offer, the other side accepts that offer, and there is some sort of consideration underlying the transaction. With a smart contract, however, the parties aren't necessarily making and accepting offers \u2014 they are consenting to a mutually agreeable computer program that outlines the if-then conditions regarding the transaction between the parties. In the eyes of a court, this by itself may not create a binding agreement. If the agreement is not binding, it may be tough to recover damages down the road.To rectify this issue, the smart contract should include a clause detailing the agreement between the parties;\u00a0for example, that this contract is regarding the sale of real estate, and that Party A agrees to exchange the deed for the property (or the use of an apartment for a night, or the title to a car, or whatever the contract is for) for the specific sum that shall be provided by Party B. Without this clause, the program is merely a set of conditions. With this clause, the rest of the program becomes the conditions to this already-specified agreement and is much more likely to be enforced. Simple, but extremely helpful.Jurisdiction: Is the Area of Jurisdiction Clearly Defined?There is a difficult jurisdictional issue on the horizon for blockchain technology. With the blockchain's decentralized transaction system, where the contract actually became final and binding is a question the courts have yet to answer. Theoretically, a court could find that a party could sue wherever validation of the transaction took place. With potentially thousands or even millions of peers validating transactions all over the country, parties could be sued in random places anywhere in the entire United States.The solution for this problem is a forum selection clause. A forum selection clause says that the parties agree to resolve any disputes in one particular jurisdiction. Though it is occasionally a spot of contention between the parties if each party wants their own city as the jurisdiction selected, this clause lowers the risk of being sued at any time anywhere in the country.Dispute Resolution: Does It Have a Clear Dispute Resolution Mechanism in Place?Last, if the contract is silent, the parties are automatically required to resolve any issues in state or federal court. This can be an expensive and lengthy process. If the parties agree and add a dispute resolution clause, the parties could resolve their disputes in front of an arbitrator instead. Though arbitration has been vilified recently as the tool of big business, the contract could state that both parties must agree to the arbitrator beforehand or that a neutral third party \u2014 such as the American Arbitration Association \u2014 could make the choice. This would eliminate any potential bias on the part of the arbitrator, as it would be the neutral third party, not either of the invested parties, choosing the arbitrator.Further, the parties could ensure that the arbitrator had some knowledge and experience with blockchain technology. Most judges today may not have even heard of this technology, much less conversant in the ins-and-outs of program complexities. Including a dispute resolution clause requiring that the arbitrator have some blockchain experience may be a benefit to both sides.ConclusionSmart contracts may be the future of transactions. However, the technology is in its infancy and has not been thoroughly examined by state or federal courts. There are a number of potential issues, such as offer/acceptance, jurisdiction and dispute resolution. Thus, while this technology may be extremely useful for certain transactions now, it should still be considered best practice to hire a lawyer for important or complex contracts, such as the sale of IP or complex services.This is a guest post by Gregg D.

The new language was presented by its creator, Russell O'Connor, Infrastructure Tech Developer at Blockstream, at the ACM SIGSAC Workshop on Programming Languages and Analysis for Security (PLAS 2017).\"Simplicity is a blockchain programming language that is so simple, it fits on a t-shirt,\u201d O'Connor told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt is critical that smart contracts behave in ways that all participants expect, and applying formal verification to Simplicity allows us to achieve that.\u201dSimplicity is still a Blockstream Research & Development project, but there\u2019s potential for its use in Blockstream products in the future, according to the company\u2019s announcement.\u201cSimplicity is flexible enough that I anticipate many new, domain-specific, languages will generate Simplicity, and this will give users the freedom to generate smart contracts using the tools that most suit their needs,\" added O'Connor.O'Connor\u2019s paper, titled \u201cSimplicity: A New Language for Blockchains,\u201d presents Simplicity as \u201ca new programming language, designed to be used for cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications, which aims to improve upon existing cryptocurrency languages, such as Bitcoin Script and Ethereum\u2019s EVM [virtual machine], while avoiding some of the problems they face.\u201dBitcoin script is limited by design and unsuitable for complex smart contracts that need more than a small set of simple templates to perform tasks like digital signature verification. Ethereum, on the other hand, includes a more expressive and flexible, Turing-complete programming language, which allows for arbitrarily complex smart-contracts in principle. But, in practice, Ethereum doesn\u2019t support static analysis to pre-determine the computing resources that a program will require and, thus, filter out too costly contracts and infinite loops. Therefore, pre-paid \u201cgas\u201d fees are lost when an Ethereum program \u201cruns out of gas.\u201d The simpler Bitcoin scripting, which supports static analysis, doesn\u2019t present similar issues.In a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, O'Connor proposed Simplicity as an alternative to Bitcoin Script, noting that static analysis is important for both node operators and for Simplicity program designers.\u201cStatic analysis is a technique that provides a universal algorithm to determine how much any Simplicity program will cost to run before you stake your money on it,\u201d O'Connor told Bitcoin Magazine.Simplicity can be seen as a more flexible alternative to Bitcoin scripting, not Turing-complete but expressive enough to build useful smart contracts for blockchain applications, or as an alternative to Ethereum, which will support static analysis and other desirable features including improved safety, formal semantics, and Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MASTs). While Simplicity is intended as a low-level language for smart contracts, O\u2019Connor envisages the possibility of compiling programs written in higher-level languages (like Ethereum\u2019s Solidity) to Simplicity.\u201cIvy and the \u03a3-State Authentication Language are existing programming language development efforts that may be suitable for being compiled to Simplicity,\u201d notes O\u2019Connor in the paper. \u201cFor the time being, generating Simplicity with our [Haskell] and [Coq] libraries is possible.\u201dThe next step in Simplicity\u2019s development will be a bare-bones SDK (Software Developer Kit) that will include formal semantics and correctness proofs in Coq, a Haskell implementation for constructing Simplicity programs and a C interpreter for Simplicity. Then, the new language will be ready for initial deployment in the Elements project, Blockstream\u2019s open-source codebase for sidechains, so that developers can start experimenting with the code.But, as O\u2019Connor stated on bitcoin-dev, \u201cOnly after extensive vetting would it be suitable to consider Simplicity for inclusion in Bitcoin.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 3}

He covers topics in healthcare, technology, travel and culture. He holds bitcoin and ether.\nIn October 2017, LendEDU, a marketplace for financing loans, credit cards and other financial products, polled 1,000 Americans asking a series of questions related to Ethereum, Ripple and initial coin offerings (ICOs). They did this to gain insight into the average American\u2019s perception of cryptocurrency. The poll was conducted by online polling company OnePoll, which acted as a third party and was able to provide an age and gender breakdown of respondents. The poll was answered by 1,000 Americans ages 18 and up over two days, from October 27 to 30.Ethereum:At the time of writing, with a market capitalization of\u00a0$28.49 billion,\u00a0Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency,\u00a0about one-fourth the market capitalization of Bitcoin.\u00a0Since the start of 2017, the price of ether has grown from $7.98 to $298.31.60 percent of Americans have heard of Ethereum and 18.20 percent of Americans are planning to invest in ether (ETH)The survey showed that American awareness of Ethereum trends toward a younger (millennial) demographic with 58.49 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 having heard of the cryptocurrency and 32.08 percent of the same demographic planning to invest in Ethereum as an asset for the future.47 percent less Americans have heard of Ethereum compared to Bitcoin based on a LendEDU survey conducted a month prior on Bitcoin. When asked whether or not they would invest in either cryptocurrency as an asset for the future, Americans 25\u201334 showed the most interest. The number of these respondents saying they would invest in Bitcoin was only 6.68 percent greater than those saying they would invest in Ethereum.\u00a0\u00a0On the opposite end of the spectrum, only about 1.34 percent of Americans 55 and older plan to invest in Ethereum as an asset for the future. Across all age groups, 37.80 percent of respondents were unsure about investing in Ethereum, which could indicate a lack of knowledge about cryptocurrency as much as general uncertainty about future investing.Ripple:22.20 percent of Americans have heard of Ripple and 14.80 percent of Americans are planning to invest in Ripple (XRP)At the time of writing, with a market capitalization of approximately $8 billion, Ripple is the third-largest cryptocurrency (depending on whether or not you count Bitcoin Cash). That\u2019s one-fifteenth the size of Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization. Since the start of 2017, the price of Ripple has grown from $0.006 to $0.201. As can be seen by these numbers, LendEDU\u2019s survey respondents showed awareness and investment interest in Ripple at similar levels to those for Ethereum.In a recent interview, the CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, made the point to elaborate on the differentiating value propositions for each of the three largest cryptocurrencies:\u201cIn 2017, people have realized there isn\u2019t going to be one crypto to rule them all. You\u2019re seeing vertical solutions where XRP is focused on payment problems, Ethereum is focused on smart contracts, and increasingly Bitcoin is a store of value. Those aren\u2019t competitive. In fact, I want Bitcoin and Ethereum to be successful.\u201dICOsIt\u2019s no secret that initial coin offerings (ICOs) have risen in popularity this year as much for their innovative investment opportunity as their regulatory controversy and scams.\u00a0In September 2017, China declared ICOs to be illegal, while the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u00a0exposed two different ICOs\u00a0claiming to be backed by real estate and diamonds to be frauds.\u00a024.90 percent of Americans have heard of ICOs and 15.10 percent of Americans are planning to invest in startups via ICOsAs seen in this chart, almost two-thirds of the American population polled are not sure whether or not ICOs are illegal, while 21 percent believe that investing in them is illegal. As a comparison, in the Bitcoin survey from September, only 10.69 percent of respondents incorrectly believed it was illegal to own bitcoin in the U.S.\u00a0SummaryAcross all questions, LendEDU found a group of respondents who have yet to hear about these specific cryptocurrencies but are open to the idea, or at least unsure, about investing in them. All this to say, in the U.S., cryptocurrency cannot be considered mainstream: Ethereum is not quite as well-known as Bitcoin, most are unsure about whether or not ICOs break the law, and Ripple\u2019s market capitalization is not a strong indicator of its success as a currency.\u00a0", "year": 2017, "month": 11, "day": 6}

Tapscott said the young company had \u201cstumbled\u201d in falsely listing some crypto and blockchain experts as members of the firm\u2019s advisory board. He is currently talking to NextBlock investors to work out how to return their original investments and to \u201crebuild the trust of those [they] have disappointed.\u201dNextBlock Global raised $20 million in their initial oversubscribed fundraising in July 2017 and had hoped to raise $100 million in the public offering. They planned to invest in digital currencies, blockchain hosting platforms and blockchain-based applications.CIBC and investment bank Canaccord Genuity (a former employer of Tapscott\u2019s) were underwriters on the deal, but CIBC pulled its support from the young venture capital firm amid the allegations. According to BNN, clients of CIBC received an email saying, \u201cCIBC has withdrawn as an agent from the NextBlock Global Limited private placement.\u201d CIBC was not available for comment.Sources have told BNN that Canaccord Genuity remained in the deal.An article in Forbes last week detailed complaints from Kathryn Haun, Vinny Lingham, Dmitry Buterin and Karen Gifford that Tapscott had circulated an investor deck that incorrectly listed them as members of the NextBlock advisory board.Dmitry Buterin, co-founder of Blockgeeks and father of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, was included in at least one draft of the investor deck. He told Bitcoin Magazine in a recent interview what had happened. He recounted:\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple. Alex asked me to be an advisor, I declined. Then I got a deck forwarded to me which listed me as an advisor. It was forwarded to me by investors who received it from Alex.\u201dButerin said he had met with Tapscott to let him know he wouldn\u2019t be on the advisory board:\u201cWe had a meeting and I was not convinced that they have the right resources to pull this off.\u201dWhen Is an Advisory Board Not an Advisory Board?A thread on Twitter about NextBlock recently included some comments about how advisory boards have become routine and are often used as window dressing for making ICO pitches and, therefore, they aren\u2019t really \u201cadvising\u201d as such.One user commented that likely only 50 to 60 percent of advisory boards are legitimate anymore, and put the NextBlock situation in a different light, implying that it\u2019s become common practice to dress up a proposal with photos of known experts.Amber D. Scott, CEO of Outlier Solutions, told Bitcoin Magazine that she gets several requests a week to sit on ICO advisory boards. Scott explained that the conversation often goes like this:ICO rep: \u201cWe saw you speak at an event and would love to add you as an advisor.\u201d Scott: \u201cI\u2019ve looked at your website/white paper and I\u2019m not sure where you need compliance advice. Could you please elaborate on that?\u201dICO rep: \u201cYou don\u2019t actually have to do anything. We\u2019ll just put your picture and bio on the website. You have a great name in the community.\u201dAndreas Antonopoulos, well-known author of \u201cMastering Bitcoin,\u201d says on his website that he does not accept invitations to sit on advisory boards and that he will not discuss projects publicly if he does work as an advisor.Vitalik Buterin has also had to make it clear several times on Twitter that he is not an advisor for a number of firms that have touted his advice.What could have been a major scandal for both the Tapscotts (father Don and son Alex) has been averted by this move, but how much long-term damage both NextBlock and the Blockchain Research Institute will sustain to their reputation remains to be seen.The father-son Tapscott team co-founded the Toronto-based think tank Blockchain Research Institute, and co-authored the book \u201cBlockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business and the World,\u201d which has been translated into more than 20 languages.The Blockchain Research Institute is holding a Members Summit this week in Toronto.

A 10x return since the beginning of the year has put bitcoin on a parabolic growth path that is testing the limits of this 2-year long bull market:Figure 1: BTC-USD, 3-Day Candles, Parabolic Growth EnvelopeThe gains have been incredible for those trading bitcoin for the last couple years, and it appears that this parabolic envelope is coming to a close. In order for this bull market to remain viable, it will need to keep up on a very aggressive, parabolic growth path that has the immediate upper resistance at between $8,000 \u2013 $9,000. Similarly, the lower support is around $5,800. A break of either the support or resistance will put bitcoin in a very precarious position. If bitcoin breaks the upper, parabolic resistance trend and manages to find support on the trendline, this could signal an entirely new bull market. However, if bitcoin breaks the lower support, this would send a very, very bearish signal to traders, indicating a breakdown of the 2-year long bull market.Given the trend we have seen over the last two years, it would not be at all surprising to see a test of the $8,000s before any sort of market correction (micro or macro) takes place. We are on a very aggressive growth path and, on a macro-scale, one that has has shown a consistent trend of testing the upper curve prior to correction. This is a very strong bull market and it it should not be underestimated. However, in an effort to remain objective, it\u2019s important to present the not-so-obvious argument and state the consequences of a disruption of this macro bull market.Figure 2: BTC-USD, 1-Day candles, Retests of Previous All-time HighsThroughout the life of this parabolic run, bitcoin has shown a penchant for retests during market pullbacks. We can see in the image above that every time the market peaks the upper resistance curve, it has pulled back to retest the previous all-time high before the resumption of uptrend. Part of the consequences of this parabolic growth is we are at a point where the growth is so aggressive that a retest of the previous all-time high would throw the market trend well outside the parabolic envelope. And, as stated above, that would send a very strong macro bearish signal to traders and investors as this marks a breakdown of the 2-year long trend.Summary:The parabolic trend bitcoin has seen over the last two years is approaching a very aggressive level that could make bitcoin see aggressive price swings in the coming weeks.The upper boundary of the parabolic curve could have bitcoin testing the $8,000s.A break below the lower curve could spark a macro bear market as this signals the breakdown of the bull market\u2019s multi-year trend.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Powered by Politeia, a stand-alone tool for off-chain data storage, the system allows anyone in the community to submit a formal proposal for the evolution of the Decred platform. This proposal is time-stamped, versioned and permanently stored in an off-chain repository to promote transparency and eliminate the possibility of censorship.\u201cDecred is Bitcoin as it should have been,\u201d argued crypto investor Jon Creasy. According to Decred evangelists, Bitcoin was conceived as a decentralized community project, but, today, it\u2019s de-facto controlled by an oligarchy of top developers and miners and vulnerable to pressures from powerful external actors.The Decred project wants to build a more open and progressive cryptocurrency with a system of community-based governance integrated into its blockchain.\"We are more committed than ever to a sustainable and fair system of governance,\" said Jake Yocom-Piatt, Decred Project Lead. \"For Decred, Politeia will provide an off-chain public record of proposals, comments on proposals, and stakeholder votes. Although Decred will be using Politeia in a public capacity, it can provide similar utility as a private unalterable store of data. Public and private use-cases include document and record storage, reputation and identity systems, and supply chains.\"The Decred team wants to create an ideal infrastructure for self-governance of a cryptocurrency. Politeia, named after a classical Greek term that can be translated as \u201csystem of government,\u201d is an off-chain store of data, both versioned and time-stamped (in other words, \u201cgit plus timestamping\u201d). While Politeia will initially be used in Decred\u2019s proposal system, it has been developed as a generic tool that allows its users to create and maintain arbitrary data in a version-controlled and time-stamped environment. Time stamps and proposal anchorsAll proposals for the evolution of the Decred platform, initially formatted as text with markdown and PNG images, will be stored in Politeia with version control and time stamps anchored in the blockchain. Proposal anchors in the Decred blockchain include a transaction hash and a merkle path to indicate that a particular git commit hash existed before the time stamp on the next anchor in its repository.\"In addition to powering our proposal system, Politeia has been developed as a stand-alone tool that allows its users to create and maintain arbitrary data in a version-controlled and timestamped environment,\u201d Yocom-Piatt told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAlthough it does depend on using a dcrtime server for creating time stamps, Politeia does not require users to hold any decred, and we believe it has a wide array of potential applications, e.g. for records storage, identity systems, supply chains and other provenance-driven domains. Open sourcing this technology will bring the real-world utility that is necessary to attract a broad community of users.\"According to Yocom-Piatt, having cryptographically verifiable public records will give users of Politeia the assurance that their governance is being executed in a transparent fashion, with all records independently verifiable and stored in a format that is difficult to forge. \u201cBy making Decred's governance data time-ordered in a verifiable fashion, we ensure that attempts to manipulate Decred's governance, either from outside or within, will be much more difficult than when using a conventional website or similar,\u201d notes Yocom-Piatt.Any proposal submitted to Politeia that is censored can be publicly demonstrated as having been censored, creating accountability for the administrators of the proposal system and avoiding \u201cone of the more insidious and common practices of modern social media sites, where data is silently censored.\u201dComments on proposals, editing proposals and voting on proposals will be added to the Politeia platform. Decred is also announcing a competition for projects based on Politeia with winners to be announced at an event in Austin, Texas, on December 1, 2017. The prizes for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place will be the equivalent of $10,000, $5,000 and $2,000, respectively, paid in decred.", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 26}

The group also released the \u201cBlockstack Token Whitepaper,\u201d which explains the technical details of the Blockstack Token mining system, the incentive mechanisms and genesis block. The white paper highlights that the traditional internet is a 40-year-old technology that was originally meant to be a decentralized network. Even though the lower layers of the internet remain fairly decentralized, the application layer of the internet has several centralized points of control and failure. This is what Blockstack intends to solve.The paper presents Stack, a blockchain token protocol that upgrades the Blockstack blockchain and introduces decentralized governance and incentive mechanisms for a decentralized app ecosystem. Stack enables several new features such as atomic swaps and support for light clients, and it introduces a novel mining mechanism.Muneeb Ali, co-founder at Blockstack, told Bitcoin Magazine: \u201cThe Blockstack Token is introducing incentive mechanisms for developers and users to participate in an ecosystem of decentralized apps. Our token white paper describes a novel mining system where in addition to a mining mechanism that secures the blockchain, there is a mechanism for app developers and early users to get new tokens released into the system. We believe that these built-in incentive mechanisms can play a critical role in sustainable growth of the ecosystem.\u201dAli added: \u201cIn addition, the token enables decentralized governance for protocol upgrades and enables new features like support for truly independent mobile clients, atomic swaps and more.\u201dThe group founders explained in a press release that their primary goal for the Blockstack token sale event is to achieve a wide distribution of tokens. They believe token holders are the \u201ceconomic stakeholders\u201d of the ecosystem, and that it\u2019s important that the economic distribution represents a broad community.

There is no pre-sale or discounts for the upcoming token sale. Existing shareholders of Blockstack PBC purchased tokens allocated for the \u201cCreators\u201d earlier in a separate offering. No other party can buy current or future tokens until the sale opens. Unaccredited users, accredited investors and qualified purchasers can participate in the sale at the same terms. Unaccredited users will get a \u201cvoucher\u201d that they can bring back to finish the transaction and will make the payment at a later date.For more details, see Blockstack\u2019s announcement on their blog.", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 27}

Unfortunately, recycling and cleaning the contaminated water has not been an option, with companies typically transporting the produced and flowback water in barrels to underground disposal well facilities.That is until now.U.S.-based Genesis Research & Technology Group has developed, tested and patented a new water purification technology system that can be utilized for multiple applications, including oil and gas, industrial, food and agriculture, humanitarian efforts, and emergency and disaster relief. And in partnership with blockchain development company MVP Asia Pacific Inc., they are creating an Internet of Things (IoT) water quality sensor to permanently store tamper-proof water quality records on the Ethereum blockchain.The IoT sensor system has safeguards in place to ensure that the readings aren\u2019t manipulated. Genesis will also operate under an independent auditing system enabling third-party-approved access to make sure no one alters the sensors. The IoT sensor aims to reduce the carbon footprint associated with unnecessary transportation, and to enable unusable water to become usable again. Over a three-year period, Genesis has shown proven results that up to 2,000 barrels of fracking water can be treated on-site without chemicals into clean water\u201cA Genesis water recycling system will allow oil producers to be friendlier to the earth\u2019s environment, conserving water, not exposing the roads and countryside to the millions of trucking miles necessary to transport water, and not dispos[ing] of millions of gallons of contaminated water in the ground,\u201d said Ron Price, CEO of Genesis Research & Technology Group, to Bitcoin Magazine.By combining the Genesis water treatment system with the blockchain via the IoT solution, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and communities around the world can have confidence that the information they see is real, readily accessible and verifiable, said Price. This in turn will make the fracking industry more transparent, discouraging wasteful and environmentally unfriendly practices. It\u2019s also hoped that this will provide an incentive to companies who may be rewarded by consumers and governments to promote excellence.According to Darren McVean, CEO of MVP Asia Pacific, blockchain technology presents huge potential for the environmental and land rehabilitation sectors.\u201cIn the past, governments and community groups have had limited to no access to land, water and air quality records,\u201d McVean said. \u201cAs a result, few have confidence in the records and this has stifled investment in environmentally friendly technology.\u201dGenesis will be launching their ICO on October 27, where there will be a maximum of 40,000,000 Water Tokens available. Genesis hopes to have their first system operational and generating revenue within six months after the closing of the ICO. They plan to have 12 systems up and running within nine months after the ICO.", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 26}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nUpdate: The main organizers behind the SegWit2x project have suspended the hard fork. While this technically does not mean SegWit2x itself won't proceed, it's extremely unlikely to be considered \"Bitcoin\" or \"BTC\" by anyone.The SegWit2x hard fork is drawing closer by the day. Within little over two weeks after the publication of this article, a group of Bitcoin companies and miners plans to double Bitcoin\u2019s block weight limit as per the New York Agreement.But it currently seems certain that not everyone will adopt this incompatible protocol change. As such, the SegWit2x fork would result in two different blockchains and two different currencies. For the purpose of this article, these two blockchains will be referred to as the \u201coriginal chain\u201d and the \u201cSegWit2x chain,\u201d with their respective coins.The big question, right now, is which of these two blockchains would be considered the \u201creal\u201d Bitcoin, with the currency ticker \u201cBTC.\u201d Since no single individual or entity is really in charge of this decision, Bitcoin exchanges play a major role: they list the currencies that are traded under specific names.To find out which coin is likely to earn the ticker \u201cBTC,\u201d here\u2019s an overview of the 20 largest Bitcoin exchanges based on trading volume according to data from Bitcoinity, and their stance on this naming issue.1. Bitfinex: original chain is \u201cBTC\u201d, SegWit2x chain is \u201cB2X\u201dHong Kong\u2013based cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex is the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world by trading volume.Interestingly, Bitfinex also offers a futures exchange, on which claims on the future versions of the coins on both chains are already traded. These futures are currently labeled as \u201cBT1\u201d for coins on the original chain, and \u201cBT2\u201d for coins on the SegWit2x chain.In Bitfinex\u2019s announcement of these futures, published on October 5, as well as the accompanying terms and conditions, the exchange also reveals that \u201cthe order books for the BT2 trading pairs will become the order books for the B2X pairs.\u201d Meanwhile, the BT1 futures will be settled into BTC. In other words, the coins on the original chain will be listed as \u201cBTC\u201d, while the coins on the SegWit2x chain will be called \u201cB2X.\u201dUpdate, October 30th:\u00a0It was pointed out to us that in a separate hard fork statement, Bitfinex does leave open the possibility of changing the tickers if \"market forces suggest an alternative, more appropriate, labeling scheme for one or both chains.\"2. BitMEX: original chain is \u201cBTC\u201dBitMEX, a cryptocurrency exchange officially based in the Republic of Seychelles, is the second-largest Bitcoin exchange in the world based on trading volume.In a blog post published on October 13, BitMEX announced it would continue to list coins on the original chain as \u201cBTC.\u201dMoreover, because SegWit2x will not implement strong replay protection, BitMEX will not list coins on the SegWit2x chain at all, nor offer any other type of support. 3. Bitstamp: unknownBitstamp, which is officially based in the United Kingdom but operates from several European countries, has not yet made any public statements concerning the SegWit2x fork. The exchange also did not respond to inquiries from Bitcoin Magazine.Bitstamp did sign a hard fork statement insisting on consensus and strong replay protection for hard forks earlier this year, though that statement referred to a potential Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork \u2014 not SegWit2x.Update, October 30th: After publication of this article, Bitstamp CEO\u00a0Nejc Kodric\u00a0told Bitcoin Magazine:\u201cHard forks are a challenge for everyone in the cryptocurrency field. They cause a lot of confusion and uncertainty for consumers, making some people hesitant to get into the field. At their worst, they can have a negative impact on the industry. At the same time, there are upsides to the forks, as they\u2019re happening because of innovation and efforts to make the transaction process potentially faster. Bitstamp takes neither a positive or negative view of the forks; we simply adjust our operations accordingly and do a tremendous amount of research on their impacts to come up with solutions and address the issues directly with our customers.\u201d4. GDAX: hash power decides which chain is \u201cBTC\u201dU.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange GDAX is effectively the exchange-arm of Coinbase. And Coinbase is a signatory of the New York Agreement.Regardless, it\u2019s not certain that Coinbase (and therefore probably also GDAX) will list coins on the SegWit2x chain as \u201cBTC.\u201d In fact, the company could well list the coins on the original chain as \u201cBTC\u201d \u2014 but public statements have been somewhat contradictory.The company initially put out a statement saying that the coins on the original chain would be listed as \u201cBTC,\u201d and the coins on the SegWit2x chain as \u201cB2X.\u201d However, this initial statement was effectively withdrawn the very next day, as the company put out a new statement \u201cclarifying\u201d that Coinbase will actually list the coins with the most accumulated hash power backing it as \u201cBTC.\u201d And on Twitter, company CEO Brian Armstrong suggested that it\u2019s not just hash power but also market cap that will decide which coin will be listed as \u201cBTC.\u201d5. bitFlyer: unknownbitFlyer is the biggest Bitcoin exchange in Japan. bitFlyer is also a signatory of the New York Agreement in support of the SegWit2x hard fork, which suggests that the exchange will at least support the coin on the SegWit2x chain. bitFlyer has not yet made any public statements concerning the naming of the coin(s), however, and did not respond to inquiries from Bitcoin Magazine.6. Kraken: unknownU.S.-based Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has not yet made any public statements concerning the SegWit2x fork, either.In response to inquiries from Bitcoin Magazine, the exchange also refrained from commenting on the naming issue and instead stated:\u201cKraken makes no promises/guarantees/warranties on the outcome of the fork. We will make our best effort to handle things in a way that benefits the most clients, but clients should manage their own wallets/coins if they want perfect control.\u201d7. HitBTC: original chain is \u201cBTC\u201d, SegWit2x chain is \u201cB2X\u201dLike Bitfinex, cryptocurrency exchange HitBTC is already offering a futures market where the two future coins are traded.And in an announcement published on October 17, the exchange said it will list the coins on the SegWit2x chain as \u201cB2X.\u201d The coins on the original chain will continue to be listed as \u201cBTC.\u201dHowever, HitBTC does note that the \u201cBitcoin community might encourage \u2018BTC\u2019 title being relocated to the SegWit2x token.\u201d They added: \u201cWhatever happens, we will proceed with the decision that will be the most convenient for our traders.\u201d8. Bitcoin.de: unknownThe German Bitcoin exchange bitcoin.de has not yet made any public statements concerning the SegWit2x fork. The exchange also did not respond to inquiries from Bitcoin Magazine.9. CoinsBank (formerly known as BIT-X): original chain is \u201cBTC\u201dUnited Kingdom\u2013based cryptocurrency exchange CoinsBank (formerly known as BIT-X) has not made any public statements concerning the SegWit2x fork.In response to inquiries from Bitcoin Magazine, however, the exchange indicated that it will list coins on the original chain as \u201cBTC\u201d and will not support the SegWit2x chain.They stated:\u201cWe inform you that we are proponents of the BTC core and not planning to support other branches.\u201d10. CEX.IO: original chain is \u201cBTC\u201d, SegWit2x chain is \u201cB2X\u201dUnited Kingdom\u2013based Bitcoin exchange CEX.IO will list coins on both chains. In a blog post published on October 20, the exchange announced it will list the coins on the SegWit2x chain as \u201cB2X.\u201d It also states in the announcement that coins on the original chain will continue to be listed as \u201cBTC.\u201d11. itBit: unknownU.S.-based Bitcoin exchange itBit has not yet made any public statements concerning the SegWit2x fork. The exchange also did not respond to inquiries from Bitcoin Magazine.12. Gemini: hash power decides which chain is \u201cBTC\u201dIn an October 24 blog post written by Cameron Winklevoss, one Gemini\u2019s founders, the U.S.-based Bitcoin exchange explained that it \u201cwill be measuring total cumulative computational difficulty of the blockchain to determine what we will call Bitcoin and BTC and on the Gemini platform.\u201d In other words, Gemini will give the name \u201cBTC\u201d to the coin that has the most hash power attributed to it.It may also list the coin that does not attract the majority of total hash power, but the exchange has not given any guarantees yet, nor did it mention a name for this coin.13. Coinfloor: unknownU.K.-based Bitcoin exchange Coinfloor has not yet made any public statements concerning the SegWit2x fork. The exchange also did not respond to inquiries from Bitcoin Magazine.Coinfloor did sign the hard fork statement insisting on consensus and strong replay protection for hard forks, which originally referred to the potential Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork.14. BTCC:\u00a0hash power decides which chain is \u201cBTC\u201dHong Kong\u2013based Bitcoin exchange\u00a0BTCC\u00a0is another signatory of the New York Agreement. Like Bitfinex and HitBTC, BTCC\u00a0is already offering a futures market where the two future coins are traded. These coins are currently referred to as \u201c1MB\u201d for the coin on the original chain, and \u201c2MB\u201d for the coin on the SegWit2x chain.Update, October 29th: It was pointed out to us that according to the FAQ concerning this futures market, BTCC will after the fork \"consider the version of bitcoin that has the most proof-of-work behind it as bitcoin (BTC)\".\u00a0In other words, BTCC will give the name \u201cBTC\u201d to the coin that has the most hash power attributed to it.15. BitMarket: unknownPolish Bitcoin exchange BitMarket has not yet made any public statements concerning the SegWit2x fork. The exchange did respond to inquiries from Bitcoin Magazine, but it did not reveal which coin will be listed under what name or ticker.Instead, a BitMarket representative stated:\u201cWe reserve the right to decide whether to support or not [the] given fork of the Bitcoin. Our decision will depend on the stability of the fork\u2019s network and what issues it may cause in the future.\u201d16. QuadrigaCX: unknownCanadian Bitcoin exchange QuadrigaCX has not yet made any public statements concerning the SegWit2x fork. The exchange also did not respond to inquiries from Bitcoin Magazine.QuadrigaCX did sign the hard fork statement insisting on consensus and strong replay protection for hard forks, originally referring to the potential Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork.17. Mercado Bitcoin: original chain is \u201cBTC\u201dBrazilian Bitcoin exchange Mercado Bitcoin recently signed a statement on behalf of the Brazilian and Argentinian Bitcoin communities in opposition of SegWit2x.When asked by Bitcoin Magazine, the exchange further explained that it may or may not list the coins on the SegWit2x chain, which will in part depend on whether or not the SegWit2x chain implements strong replay protection. (This currently seems very unlikely.)If Mercado Bitcoin does list this coin, it will use the ticker \u201cB2X\u201d because \u201cthe market is converging to this ticker.\u201d They added: \u201cWe also tend to consider the Core version the legitimate one.\u201d18. Bitso: unknownMexican Bitcoin exchange Bitso is a signatory of the New York Agreement in support of the SegWit2x fork. The company has since also confirmed that it will support coins on both chains \u2014 even though it did sign the Bitcoin Unlimited\u2013inspired hard fork statement insisting on consensus and strong replay protection for hard forks.Regarding names and tickers, a Bitso representative told Bitcoin Magazine:\u201cWe have not yet decided on ticker names but hope to make an official statement soon.\u201d19. The Rock Trading: original chain is \u201cBTC\u201dMalta-based Bitcoin exchange The Rock Trading has not yet made any public statements concerning the SegWit2x fork. It did, however, sign the Bitcoin Unlimited\u2013inspired hard fork statement insisting on consensus and strong replay protection for hard forks.And, when asked by Bitcoin Magazine, The Rock Trading CTO Davide \u201cPaci Barbarossa\u201d Barbieri said the exchange will list the coins on the SegWit2x chain as \u201cB2X\u201d \u2014 if the exchange lists that coin at all.Said Barbieri:\u201cAs stated publicly, we are generally against any hard forks; we do not currently guarantee that we will handle SegWit2x, or that we will list it; as far as I know replay protection is still a concern.\u201dAnd: \u201cIf we do [list the coin on the SegWit2x chain] we will probably call it B2X or something like it.\u201d20. EXMO: unknownU.K.-based cryptocurrency exchange EXMO has not yet made any public statements concerning the SegWit2x fork. The exchange also did not respond to inquiries from Bitcoin Magazine.This article will be updated as the news develops. Did I miss anything? Feel free to let me know at aaron@bitcoinmagazine.com.

This article is going to present an update to the last discussion regarding the potential Wyckoff Distribution and provide a more contextualized, macro-view of the current bitcoin market. Before reading any further, I would like to emphasize the word \u201cpotential\u201d within the context of this discussion because until the market actually reverses, this is nothing more than a potential market set-up:Figure 1: BTC-USD, 1-HR Candles, Potential Wyckoff DistributionWhen we last discussed this potential distribution pattern, we hadn\u2019t experienced the first Upthrust (UT) or the following Upthrust After Distribution (UTAD). Both Upthrusts represent a brute-force market test of the bitcoin demand and, as you can see, the Upthrusts were very short-lived and ultimately pulled back to more comfortable price levels. At the time of this article, we are potentially in what is known as \u201cPhase C\u201d of the Wyckoff distribution. Phase C is meant to intentionally deceive the bullish retail traders into buying and to shake out unconfident shorters. The whole purpose of Phase C is to create the illusion that market wishes to push upward and resume the uptrend while the larger market players unload their liquidity onto the more bullish investors. In the Wyckoff distribution model, the UTAD is the terminal shakeout opportunity and serves to test the remaining market demand before a larger correction follows. During yesterday\u2019s potential UTAD, one of the top contract holders on OKCoin got liquidated for a 480,000 contract position \u2014 or, in other words: $48 MILLION dollars. Yesterday\u2019s liquidation was the largest liquidation in OKCoin history. So, if you feel as if you can\u2019t quite get a grasp on the market and you keep getting stopped out of your positions, just know you aren\u2019t the only one. All of this misdirection is part of Phase C within the Wyckoff distribution model.Figure 2: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, MACD and RSI DivergenceOn a more macro-view, we see clear signs of bearish divergence on both the RSI and MACD indicators. This gives us an indication that the market is struggling to squeeze out new highs and the bullish momentum is starting to die down.Zooming out, we can see bitcoin has been confined within a fairly clean ascending channel and has well-defined support and resistance along the Fibonacci Retracement set. \u00a0The channel and Fib set start from the $600s:Figure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro ChannelOne thing of note in this macro trend is dramatic decline in total volume (shown in pink) over the length of this ascending channel. The decrease in total volume shows a decrease in confidence as the price continues to climb to new highs. As the volume continues to decline, it indicates a shift toward retail investor pressure and a smaller buying influence from larger, institutional investors. If the market begins to reverse on a macro scale, we can expect to find support along the Fibonacci Retracement values shown above. Also, on the 1-day candles, there is historic support along the 50 EMA and 200 EMA. Over the course of the last year, bitcoin has yet to successfully break below the 200 EMA (shown in red), so we can expect to see a significant level of support along the 200 EMA.With the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming hard fork, it\u2019s fairly difficult to anticipate how the market will behave. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that it is entirely possible it could make further moves upward; should the market pick up bullish momentum, we can expect a test of the upper trendline of the ascending channel near the lower $7000 values.Summary:Bitcoin is continuing to show characteristics of a distribution phase.On a macro-scale, Bitcoin is signs of bullish exhaustion in the form of RSI and MACD divergence.If the market pulls back, we can expect to see support along the macro Fibonacci Retracements.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

However, today (as of the time of this article) it is starting to make moves to aggressively test the lower boundary. Specifically, as ether tests this channel, it is forming a potential reversal pattern called an Eve-and-Adam Double Top. Figure 2: ETH-USD, 1-Hour Candles, Eve-and-Adam Double TopAt the time of this article, ether is attempting to break the neckline (the pink dashed line) of the massive reversal pattern. Should ether break this neckline, the measured move from this pattern is a $30 move downward, which would ultimately shove ether outside the bullish ascending channel it has been trending within. The price target of the Double Top breakout would bring the ETH-USD price into the upper $200s. On a macro scale, ether has support along the following Fibonacci levels:Figure 3: ETH-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Fibonacci LevelsShould the ascending channel break, the above Fibonacci levels will provide support and will need to be tested in order to prove a bearish continuation. As of the time of this article, the Double Top mentioned in Figure 2 is sitting right on the 23 percent retracement values where it is making attempts at breaking it. There is strong support at these values, so if ether can break and hold below $315, it will send a strong bearish signal to the market. Should the Double Top complete, we can expect a test of the 38 percent retracement values following the break of the ascending channel. At this time, the 4-hour MACD is showing strong bearish momentum on a macro scale, and the market is picking up sell volume. Summary:For weeks, ether has been trending within an ascending channel.Ether is currently in the process of making a strong test of the ascending channel via an Eve-and-Adam Double Top reversal pattern.If the Double Top breaks downward, we can expect a break of the multi-week bullish channel and a test of the 38 percent Fibonacci Retracement values.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The conference, to be held in Stanford,\u00a0California, in the first weekend of November, will also introduce a new side event this year: Bitcoin Edge, a bootcamp for starting Bitcoin developers.\u201cThe program is extremely interesting because it delivers cutting edge research on different blockchain scalability approaches, fungibility, consensus, data propagation, alternative techniques for handling blockchains and many other topics,\u201d said Anton Yemelyanov, chair of the Scaling Bitcoin Planning Committee.Scaling Bitcoin StanfordAfter events in Montreal, Hong Kong and Milan, the fourth edition of the Scaling Bitcoin conference is taking place at Stanford University on November 4 and 5 of this year.Where the first two editions of Scaling Bitcoin were mainly focused on scaling and scalability, the third edition broadened the scope of the conference to include a more diverse set of topics. This trend will continue in Stanford, where talks will range from highly technical topics concerning privacy and fungibility, to fee markets and fee estimation, censorship resistance and more.\u201cBitcoin is the origin of all distributed ledger technology,\u201d said Yemelyanov. \u201cScaling Bitcoin has been fortunate to act as a vehicle for bringing the audience technologies such as Segregated Witness and MimbleWimble, all of which have been adopted or incorporated into various blockchain projects. We hope that other material presented by our participants will be of similar value and help the industry advance the research and development of blockchains.\u201dYemelyanov added that another key goal for Scaling Bitcoin conferences is to bring engineers and other technical minds together in a physical space where they can discuss their work in person.\u201cIt is through collaboration where a lot of ideas are born and have potential of becoming reality,\u201d he said.Bitcoin Edge Dev++In addition to the conference itself, Scaling Bitcoin is also introducing a two-day technical bootcamp for experienced developers getting into Bitcoin: Bitcoin Edge.This nonprofit initiative is an effort to help scale the development capacity of the industry, Yemelyanov explained:\u201cOne of the approaches of helping the industry scale is to scale the much needed development capacity of the industry. There is a clear talent deficit and we are trying to help all industry participants by running a nonprofit workshop that will allow developers to gain complete understanding of primitives that comprise Bitcoin and blockchains in general and be able to start working in this field.\u201dBitcoin Edge will be led by well-known Bitcoin developers and academics Anditto Heristyo, Ethan Heilman, John Newbery, Karl-Johan Alm, Nicolas Dorier, Thaddeus Dryja and Jimmy Song.

Marcelo Garcia Casil is the co-founder and CEO of Maecenas, a decentralized art gallery that aims to democratize access to fine art investment.Dadiani & PartnersIn July 2017, Dadiani\u2019s modern fine art gallery became the first in the U.K. to accept seven different cryptocurrencies as payment: bitcoin, ethereum, ethereum classic, litecoin, ripple, dash and NEM.Dadiani told Bitcoin Magazine that the decision to introduce cryptocurrencies wasn\u2019t an instinctively demand-driven decision; rather, it stemmed from a desire to encourage demand and merge the two markets together.\u201cOn a practical level, introducing cryptocurrency will broaden the market, bringing a new type of buyer to art and luxury,\u201d she said.Through her recently launched Dadiani & Partners \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s first and only luxury asset and commodity exchange for cryptocurrencies \u2014 Dadiani is hoping to unlock the potential of the digital currency market for high net-worth (HNW) investors and consumers. Acting as an intermediary, Dadiani & Partners will enable HNWs a platform to purchase luxury goods in digital currency. Dadiani says that there has been an increase in demand with the number of people seeking the purchase of assets in cryptocurrency.\u201cMany bitcoin millionaires are unable to cash in their digital currency as the banks won\u2019t convert large amounts of cryptocurrency for cash,\u201d she added.Passionate about cryptocurrencies, and the blockchain that underpins them, Dadiani believes that they will have a profound impact in every sphere of business and our everyday lives.\u201cThe technology will allow us to reclaim power, paving the way for decentralized, peer-to-peer transactions without the intervention of an intermediary,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is a revolution that goes far beyond the art market.\u201dSince introducing the acceptance of digital currencies the art gallery has sold a number of pieces. Going forward, all of the art, across all the exhibitions, will be available to purchase in the available digital currencies. Dadiani says that the artists are onboard and keen for their pieces to be sold this way.\u201cAny of the pieces we sell can still be purchased via conventional fiat currency, but purchasing via cryptocurrency enables buyers to purchase peer-to-peer, person-to-person, without the intervention of a centralized authority,\u201d Dadiani said.It\u2019s hoped that by further globalizing the business and broadening their customer base, Dadiani Fine Art will appeal to bitcoin millionaires who are looking to purchase assets via cryptocurrencies.\u201cDigital currency is being embraced by people of all ages, creed and class, and as it\u2019s happening in other sectors, there is no reason why the gap between the modern digital world with the luxury sector cannot be bridged.\u201dMaecenasInvestment in the art world can be an expensive proposition. Named after Gaius Maecenas, an ancient Roman patron of the arts, Maecenas, is attempting to remove this barrier by letting anyone buy shares of fine art. Through its blockchain-driven platform, Maecenas divides artwork ownership into fragments and connects art owners with investors where shares are bought and sold.\u201cBy turning masterpieces into tokenized tradable assets, Maecenas democratizes access to fine art by letting a much wider audience invest in multi-million dollar artworks which would otherwise be out of reach,\u201d Casil said to Bitcoin Magazine.Buying access to the artwork\u2019s investment value does not mean buying access to the actual artwork itself, however. According to Maecenas, art pieces are not put on display; rather, they are held in purpose-built art storage facilities, ensuring the work is safe and looked after. If there is a demand in the future, then they may introduce an art-leasing facility where art lovers can temporarily hold the piece of art for a fee. The fee would then be distributed among the shareholders as income.By injecting liquidity and transparency into the fine art market, the platform claims to be adding aspects to the sector that have been missing. Determining a fair price of an illiquid asset is now made possible via the blockchain through the conversion of small and liquid tradable financial units, creating tamper-proof, digital certificates denoting ownership. These are similar to shares of a company and can be traded on an open exchange.Through the implementation of a Dutch auction process, Maecenas permits investors to submit private bids stating how many shares of the artwork they want to own and what price they\u2019re willing to pay for them.\u201cThe Dutch auction smart contract then handles all the bids and uses a well-known algorithm to determine the optimal price for the artwork shares,\u201d Casil added. \u201cThis process is transparent and discourages price manipulation.\u201dMaecenas\u2019 ART utility token functions as a clearing and settlement mechanism for all transactions of artwork on the Maecenas ecosystem. Participating in Dutch auctions, leasing artwork or performing any other sensitive platform operation is handled via smart contracts that require ART tokens to operate, says Casil.\u201cIn the case of the auctions themselves, the token represents the investor bid and commitment, and a dollar value equivalent of the tokens is escrowed in the contract for the duration of the auction.\u201dFor instance, if an investor wants to bid $50,000 for an artwork, and ART is worth $2, then 25,000 ART tokens must be submitted to the smart contract to reflect the bid.To ensure the work is authentic, Maecenas has an internal team that checks the full provenance of the artwork including certificates of authenticity, condition reports, insurance policies, certificates of storage and valuation reports. Independent reputable experts will also assess and appraise the artwork. The documents produced during the due-diligence process are then protected and stored securely on the blockchain.Maecenas recently completed their token crowdsale which raised 50,744 ETH. They are aiming to launch their platform in the first quarter of 2018.", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 18}

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nMoney 20/20 Las Vegas is only a few days away. The event, to be held on October 22\u201325, 2017, at the Venetian, will be packed with people from the top tiers of banking and finance looking to learn more about the future of money.One thing is for sure, blockchain technology will play a key role in that future. Since 2014, the financial event, which will attract more than 11,000 visitors this year, has devoted an entire track to blockchain topics. Originally, the track was called \u201cBit(coin) World,\u201d but that changed as conversations shifted to Bitcoin\u2019s underlying ledger technology. \u00a0For blockchain enthusiasts struggling to sort through the 450 presentations at Money 20/20, the following is a breakdown of the blockchain track and other blockchain-related talks at the event. Blockchain TuesdayTuesday is the main day for blockchain programming at Money 20/20. Kicking off the blockchain track will be Adam Ludwin, CEO and co-founder of Chain, a company that provides blockchain solutions to banks. Ludwin\u2019s talk will center on whether crypto-assets are in a sort of \u201890s bubble or if something real and substantial is happening beneath the hype. To give a sense of how fast things are moving, bitcoin was around $650 at last year\u2019s Money 20/20, when one panelist at the event, then Blockstream developer Eric Martindale, predicted bitcoin would increase 10x in value over the next 12 months. His prediction was nearly spot on. Bitcoin reached more than $5,800 just last week. With crypto-assets hitting all time highs across the board, the new funding model known as initial coin offerings (ICOs) have raised $2.2 billion this year alone. Yet, amidst the enthusiasm, the threat of increased regulations hover like a dark cloud. Last month, the SEC brought the first charges against two so-called ICOs in what may be just the beginning of a long-anticipated crackdown. \u00a0\u00a0Four more panels on Tuesday will focus on issues like: What problems are private blockchains solving? Are ICOs here to stay or are they just a passing fad? What threats do regulatory agencies pose to ICOs? And, how will blockchain technology potentially transform stock exchanges? These panels will include experts from companies like Bloq, Kik, Fenbushi Capital, AngelList, Pantera, JP Morgan Chase, R3, Hyperledger, Nasdaq, and the London Stock Exchange Group.\u00a0In between those, Arthur and Kathleen Breitman will talk about their new smart contract platform Tezos. The project raised $230 million in an ICO in July. Tezos is a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency and smart contract platform built in the functional language OCaml. Eventually, Tezos\u2019 goal is to compete with the likes of Ethereum and Cardano, another emerging platform. A primary feature of Tezos is its formal governance scheme, where coin holders get a say in how the protocol evolves. It will be interesting to see how Tezos plans to differentiate itself in an increasingly competitive landscape. Finally, Bobby Lee, CEO and co-founder of BTCC, China\u2019s longest running bitcoin exchange, will share war stories on what it has been like operating an exchange in the biggest payments market in the world. He should have a good story to tell, given that China\u2019s central bank recently cracked down on digital currency exchanges, causing BTCC to halt all China-facing trading last month. \u00a0Other TalksTwo other blockchain-related talks will take place at Money 20/20 on Monday. Bridget van Kralingen, who leads a group called \u201cIndustry Platforms\u201d at IBM will talk about how AI, blockchain and cloud computing are converging to create better customer experiences. \u00a0Bill Barhydt, co-founder and CEO of Abra, a cryptocurrency wallet, will give a keynote announcement on Abra\u2019s \u201cnext chapter.\u201d Barhydt attracted some attention recently when he chose actress Gwyneth Paltrow as an advisor for Abra in \u201cPlanet of the Apps,\u201d a kind of \u201cShark Tank\u201d for iOS apps. \u00a0Also on Tuesday, BitGive Foundation, a nonprofit that receives bitcoin donations for charitable causes, will be giving a presentation on GiveTrack, its blockchain-based system for tracking donations in real time.The topic of blockchain applications is sure to come up in plenty of other talks and discussions at Money 20/20, such as this one on financial inclusion on Sunday and those centered around pressing issues like security (the event comes on the heels of the Equifax breach), identity and more. \u00a0", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 17}

The program intends to help developers overcome the steep learning curve associated with becoming a protocol-level contributor to projects like Bitcoin Core. In doing so, Chaincode Labs hopes to help expand Bitcoin\u2019s development community.\u201cLast year was the first run,\u201d Chaincode Labs developer John Newbery told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe\u2019ve now taken the good stuff from that and tried to make it even more focused and useful for residents this year.\u201dThe Residency ProgramChaincode Labs, in collaboration with Matt Corallo \u2014 who worked at Blockstream last year but joined Chaincode Labs since \u2014 organized the residency program for the first time in September and October of 2016. The next edition will start on January 29, 2018, and will last until February 23.Newbery himself was one of the attendees of this first residency program. He was later hired by Chaincode Labs and has since been one of the most prolific contributors to the Bitcoin Core project. Now, he is coordinating the second of two legs of the new program.\u201cChaincode Labs exists to strengthen Bitcoin,\u201d said Newbery. \u201cWe mostly do that by contributing to Bitcoin Core, but each of us has a lot of freedom to do what we think is important. And the main purpose of this residency program is to try to strengthen the developer community.\u201dSpecifically, courses will cover protocol design, adversarial thinking, threat models and security considerations, as well as address some of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest challenges, like scaling, fungibility and privacy. Attendees will mostly learn by doing and could even start contributing to the Bitcoin Core project during the residency. Throughout the program they will be assisted by the entire Chaincode Labs team \u2014 Alex Morcos, Suhas Daftuar, Matt Corallo, John Newbery and Russ Yanofsky. There may also be guest speakers.Two BlocksWhereas the first edition of the residency program lasted four straight weeks for all attendees, this time the coding classes will be cut into two two-week phases. Candidates can either pick one of two legs or join both, with room for five or six attendees per session.The first leg is coordinated by Corallo, who has been contributing to Bitcoin development since 2011.\u201cSession A is all about getting people to think about the security trade-offs and implications of the technical decisions we make,\u201d Newbery explained. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of thought that goes into all the decisions that are made in Bitcoin, but that nuance is often lost. If we can help people to understand those trade-offs better and be able to communicate them, then perhaps we can raise the level of the conversations we have about Bitcoin.\u201dThe second session will be more focused on the Bitcoin Core project itself, Newbery said.\u201cSession B is all about getting smart, talented people to start making useful contributions to Bitcoin Core. There\u2019s a steep learning curve to becoming a contributor and if I can help people who want to contribute but have felt daunted or don\u2019t know where to start, then I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019ve succeeded.\u201dAdditionally, Chaincode Labs will organize a series of Wednesday night meetups ahead of the residency program. Contents of these meetups will be similar to the residency program, but these meetups are for participants who live in (or near) New York who can\u2019t dedicate two or four full weeks to attending the residency program itself.For more information on Chaincode Labs\u2019 2018 Bitcoin residency program and to find out how to apply, see the company\u2019s announcement and the program website.", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 18}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nDevelopment of the lightning network,\u00a0the highly-anticipated second-layer Bitcoin protocol for instant microtransactions, continues to inch forward.Lightning Labs, major contributor to the lightning network daemon, lnd, announced its cross-platform Lightning Desktop App last week. The open-source lightning wallet is essentially a user interface (UI) built on top of lnd and powered by Lightning Labs\u2019 new open-source Bitcoin light client, Neutrino.\u201cThis is the first functioning user interface for both sending and receiving lightning transactions with a light client mode,\u201d Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark told Bitcoin Magazine.The lightning network is currently being developed by several teams working on different but interoperable implementations of the protocol. Several of these implementations are functional, though only on Bitcoin\u2019s test network (\u201ctestnet\u201d): a sort of copy of the Bitcoin network with valueless coins specifically designed for testing new applications and more.But, while there are already several lightning daemons available for testnet, most are only usable via command line tools. Developers Olaoluwa Osuntokun, Bryan Vu and Case Sandberg collaborated to now extend lnd with the new Lightning Desktop App to provide a user interface.\u201cI think the big takeaway is being able to visualize this technology and see what an early UI might look like,\u201d said Stark. \u201cIt's one thing to be using the command line, as our lnd testers and developers have been, but it's another to be able to download the app. Being able to see this kind of progress is important.\u201dAs part of the announcement, Lightning Labs also introduced Neutrino, the new open-source Bitcoin light client that powers the Lightning Desktop App. As a main benefit, Neutrino users don\u2019t need to download the entire Bitcoin blockchain, which is currently over 140 gigabytes in size. This makes the desktop app much more accessible to regular users who transact small amounts, for which the lightning network is particularly suited. And because Neutrino uses a new method of transaction filtering (client side instead of bloom filters), it offers more privacy than most light clients, too.The release of the new Lightning Desktop App kicks off a two-week \u201ctesting blitz,\u201d as the company described it in their accompanying blog post. Developers are invited to experiment with the desktop app itself, as well as with Neutrino. Further, it makes it much easier for anyone to play around with lnd and the lightning network itself.\u201cThe really cool thing about having our desktop app out there is now there's an easy way for people to interact with all of the apps that developers are building on Lightning, such as Yalls,\u201d said Stark.After the two-week testing period, the implementation will enter a regular release cycle. Releasing the wallet for Bitcoin mainnet, however, could take a while longer still, Stark explained:\u201cWe're working toward testing and making the software more stable before releasing a beta. This is financial software and its a protocol dealing with money, so we want to ensure people can have a good user experience.\u201dThere is no specific deadline for the beta release, but Stark added that, \"The next step is for us to gather feedback from testers and develop it further, along with improvements in lnd and Neutrino.\"The open-source Lightning Desktop App code is available on GitHub.", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 19}
{"title": "This Blockchain-Powered Platform Aims to Disrupt the Esport Gambling Industry", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/blockchain-powered-platform-aims-disrupt-esport-gambling-industry/", "birthday": "Oct 19, 2017  2:12 PM EST", "date": "2017-10-19 19:12:00", "content": "David Hollerith works in editorial for BTC Inc. He covers topics in healthcare, technology, travel and culture. He holds bitcoin and ether.\nEsports wagering is a large \u2014 and growing \u2014 global industry at the intersection between gambling, technology and entertainment. In their 2017 Global Esports Markets Report,\u00a0Newzoo found that China and North America will generate $362 million during 2017, or 52 percent of global esports industry's revenue. If the esports industry continues on the same growth trajectory, the global industry is expected to generate $1.4 billion in 2020.Unikrn\u2019s blockchain-powered platform is tapping into this growth industry, offering services such as \u201cskill and spectator betting applications, a tournament series, team ownership, a casino group and multimedia content for the esports fanbase.\u201dAlong with launching an initial coin offering (ICO) in mid-September, the company has expanded its offerings to the European Union through a joint venture with RBP, a key player in the online horserace and sports betting market, and plans to launch a new skills-based product.Expanding across the European Union comes after the platform was granted a much coveted gaming license from the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA). As one of the first European Territories to regulate online gambling, Malta has reportedly become a staunch regulatory supporter over the past several years. Today, over 100 companies currently hold a license issued by the MGA including software developers, online casinos and Remote iGaming operators. Though obtaining a gaming license from the MGA took more than a year, for Unikrn, it has provided an opportunity to enhance their reputation as a legitimate esports wagering platform; something critical for their successful expansion and token sale. \u201cThey [MGA] are by every measure the gold standard and one of of the most respected authorities for responsible and ethical wagering,\u201d said Unikrn founder and CEO Rahul Sood in a statement.After creating the VoodooPC in 1991 then selling it to Hewlett-Packard, Sood spent 18 years as an entrepreneur. Next, he joined as general manager of Microsoft Ventures, Microsoft\u2019s international startup accelerator and outreach program. Sood left Microsoft in 2014 to enter the world of live immersive esports betting by co-founding Unikrn.Why Blockchain?During its Series A round, Unikrn received funding from several notable investors including Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, actor Ashton Kutcher\u2019s venture firm, Sound Ventures, media executive Elisabeth Murdoch\u2019s venture fund Freelands Ventures, media executive Shari Redstone\u2019s Advancit Capital and the largest betting company in Australia, Tabcorp. The commonality between most of these venture funds is that they typically pick portfolio companies working in a mix of media, technology and entertainment.Anthony Di Iorio, serial entrepreneur and CEO of Decentral, joined UnikoinGold as an advisory team member because he finds the project both intriguing and well-supported. \u201cI'm a big believer in the power of decentralized technologies, like blockchains, to empower entrepreneurs and individuals,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cI'm motivated to support the entrepreneurs, the projects, and the communities that are pushing that technology forward by applying it in interesting and exciting ways to existing markets. Unikrn is a bit special.\u201d Unikrn\u2019s Editor-in-Chief of content, Ryan Jurado, describes the platform\u2019s journey toward the blockchain as a tool for product and community growth. In 2015, Unikrn released Unikoin, a free, internal, non-cryptographic token issued in 2014 that gives users the ability to bet on esports and win prizes in regulated markets where Unikrn is unlicensed to operate. However, Unikoin had no secondary market and customers persistently asked for more value or uses for the token.Jurado explained that idea for Unikrn to use blockchain technology first came from Mark Cuban in early 2016. After investigating the technology, the team found using a blockchain-based currency would improve compliance and accountability, two activities paramount in bookkeeping. \u201cThe distributed ledger makes Know Your Customer (KYC) and risk management easier and less costly,\u201d Jurado said to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt saves time and money used for converting currencies, and helps minimize engagement with banks.\u201d Along with a distributed ledger model, Jurado also pointed out that the blockchain \u201cexpands real-time betting, live betting and skill-based products that would be difficult, or impossible, using fiat currency.\u201d The blockchain\u2019s ability to increase transaction options while decreasing the need for transactional trust was another value Unikrn sought, Jurado explained, resulting in \u201can Ethereum-based token with an open ledger that can be used to better rate risk and flag potential abuse.\u201d A gaming platform such as Unikrn which runs vast numbers of transactions per day manages a lot of risk benefits from \u201can Ethereum-based token with an open ledger that can be used to better rate risk and flag potential abuse.\u201d Furthermore, as Jurado pointed out, \u201cFor users, it\u2019s a home-run: Using blockchain is less expensive than using fiat, and less overhead means less expensive products.\u201dTale of Two KoinsTo run the token sale and crypto platform, Unikrn opened a subsidiary, Unikrn Bermuda Ltd. The token that Jurado hopes will become \u201cthe decentralized token of esports and gaming\u201d is called UnikoinGold (UKG) and was made available in September. Di Iorio described UnikoinGold as \u201cthe (decentralized) beating heart of the secure and seamless wagering ecosystem Unikrn has pioneered.\u201dAs for the original non-cryptographic token, Unikoin, Sood has stated that Unikrn is undergoing a \u201cforking\u201d of their token system in which there will be two currencies: UnikoinGold and UnikoinSilver. Anybody in the world can buy and use the Ethereum-based UnikoinGold utility token in non-betting applications, including jackpots and experiences, software, hardware, esports, teams and tournaments; however, only users in Unikrn-licensed regions will be able to use it to bet.Though UnikoinSilver can only be earned, it can be used in most unregulated markets around the world. \u201cThe token will allow every non-minor esports and gaming fan to engage in all Unikrn betting products, regardless of where they live. It is a free, non-blockchain token, but will allow fans to unlock real prizes and non-betting operations including editorial, production studios, tournament organization and live broadcasting.\u201d UnikoinSilver also appears to be an alternative \u201cto unregulated skin betting for regions where real-money betting can\u2019t be offered.\u201d ESPN Meets Esports Meets VegasHaving already raised $30 million in ether, the UnikoinGold token sale is capped at $100 million. One advantage it has as a token sale is the ease of onboarding users who are already familiar with token transactions. Unikrn\u2019s other advantages come from the fact that they already have an existing platform that is profitable and an online community that is engaged. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an investment,\u201d said Sood in a Medium post, \u201cIt\u2019s a purchase for a product that we developed that has utility on our platform and our users love and demand.\u201dA clear caveat to UnikoinGold\u2019s success is that its gaming/ICO combination is sure to keep them visible on every regulator\u2019s radar, which is why earning a Maltese gaming license was such a significant step. Even at such a unique intersection between media, gambling and gaming, Unikrn is not the only player. Other esports betting platforms using blockchain technology include FirstBlood.io, Eloplay, Gimli.io and Skincoin. And it has yet to crack the lists of top esport betting platforms on sites like OpenOdds and EsportsOnly. Sood does not seem surprised by his company\u2019s success, thus far. \u201cUnikoinGold was designed and intended for use by our own esports community. It\u2019s like ESPN meets Esports meets Las Vegas.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 19}

Days after having a strong $1,000 climb and nearly reaching $6,000 on most exchanges, we saw a strong rejection of the upper limits of the market as it plunged $600 over the course of a few short hours. Let\u2019s take a look at the macro pattern and draw a few similarities to the Wyckoff Distribution schemes:Figure 1: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Potential Wyckoff Distribution PhaseIn order for the current distribution phase to be reliable, there are certain milestones the market must reach. As shown above, we previously established a point of Preliminary Supply, a strong Buying Climax, a knee-jerk reaction into an Automatic Reaction low, and a weak rally that ultimately led to a Sign of Weakness that pushed us down several hundred dollars. The rebound from this low was strong and occurred on very high volume. However, over the length of the rally post-sign-of-weakness, the volume has begun to taper as the momentum indicators are showing signs of bullish exhaustion as it finds its local high at around the $5,700 values.One of the following milestones for the Wyckoff Distribution phase is one last dip as it tests the previous support around the Automatic Reaction low. As of the the time of this article, the current market trend is showing signs of bearish divergence on the 120-minute candles. \u00a0Zooming in closer, we can see clear signs of a potential small reversal:Figure 2: BTC-USD, 30-Minute Candles, Waning MomentumBoth the RSI and MACD are showing signs of bullish exhaustion throughout the length of this rally. Any pullback will likely be supported by the Automatic Reaction support level. Historically, this has been a strong point of support and is made more evident on the 60-minute time frame:Figure 3: BTC-USD, 60-Minute Candles, Strong Support ZoneThe 200 EMA on the 1-hour candles is historically a great support level and provides traders a pulse on the market health. As of the time of this article, the 200 EMA is lining quite nicely with the support zone offered by the Automatic Reaction Zone. A test of these price levels would take a strong push to break and hold below. If the price continues through the Wyckoff Distribution, we can expect a test of the 200 EMA and a subsequent bounce triggering an Upthrust to new all-time highs. As mentioned in the last BTC-USD market analysis, we are trending along a macro channel:Figure 4: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro Ascending ChannelAn Upthrust in this potential Distribution Phase would have a price target testing the upper channel in the $6,200\u2013$6,300 price range.Summary:A potential Wyckoff Distribution Phase is playing out.If the Distribution Phase plays as expected, we will see a test of the 200 EMA and a subsequent spring to new all-time highs.If an Upthrust to new all-time highs occurs, we can expect a price target in the $6,200s.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nSteve Wozniak (aka the \u2018Woz\u2019) thinks Bitcoin is better than gold and the U.S. dollar, which he called \u201cphony,\u201d because the government can always print more.On Sunday, October 22, 2017, the co-founder of Apple Computers shared his thoughts on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies at Money20/20 in Las Vegas where he was interviewed by Deirdre Bosa, technology reporter at CNBC. The conversation was around artificial intelligence, but the topic of Bitcoin emerged as well.Wozniak feels a currency is more \u201cstable\u201d when it cannot be diluted and, while Bitcoin has a fixed future supply (only 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined), the same cannot be said about government-backed fiat currencies.\u201cThere is a certain finite amount of bitcoin that can ever exist,\u201d Wozniak said in explaining that the U.S. government could wind up printing more dollars for political reasons. He described the U.S. dollar as \u201ckind of phony\u201d in that sense, while describing Bitcoin as more \u201cgenuine and real.\u201dSimilarly, he said, gold does not necessarily have a fixed supply either, because humans will continue to find more efficient ways to dig it out of the earth.\u201cGold gets mined and mined and mined,\u201d Wozniak said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a finite amount of gold in the world, but Bitcoin is even more mathematical and regulated and nobody can change mathematics.\u201dHe compared owning Bitcoin to owning a house. \u201cYour house has value. And if it is a house today, 40 years from now, it still is a house in value,\u201d he said, even if the price goes up and the government draws more taxes out of it.Mathematical AppreciationWozniak said he \u201cadmired\u201d Bitcoin when the digital currency was first presented.\u201cI looked at it as a form of currency,\u201d he said, adding that initially he did not understand the underlying blockchain technology but now he does.He said, initially, he had a tough time buying bitcoin because that required setting up a special bank account. The process, he said was \u201cso awkward, it kept me from getting early bitcoin.\u201d When he finally was able to buy bitcoin, he said the price immediately dropped in half.But those kind of numbers don\u2019t mean so much to Wozniak. \u201cI am not financial,\u201d he told the crowd, admitting he never followed the price of bitcoin, nor the price of Apple stock but said he was drawn to bitcoin because it was based on mathematics.\u201cMy wife and I, we judge a hotel room more by the number on the door than what is inside the room. We are both mathematicians,\u201d he said.Countless Opportunities for Blockchain TechnologyWozniak also touched on Bitcoin\u2019s underlying blockchain technology, and its importance in allowing people to transparently track things, like minerals.\u201cRight now, there is conflict with minerals in the world, and you don\u2019t want to buy conflict minerals. Well, how do you avoid it?\u201d He continued by explaining how companies will usually buy gold from different countries and smelt it together, so there is no way of knowing where it all comes from. With blockchain-based solutions, however, tracking where that gold comes from is now possible.\u201cThey are applying the technology where all the payment can only go to the good, legitimate sources that don\u2019t have conflict minerals,\u201d he added.Wozniak pointed out that, currently, there are so many applications popping up using blockchain technology that are so different than what people initially imagined, and it will take time to get used to.He also likened the introduction of smart contract platforms, like Ethereum, to when computers first came out and suddenly people were writing \u201ctens of thousands of programs\u201d nobody had ever thought of before. Smart contract platforms open those same doors of opportunity.\u201cThere is a lot more to this cryptocurrency than just the Bitcoin,\u201d he said.", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 23}

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nAbra, a mobile payment and digital currency platform that relies on Bitcoin, closed $16 million in series B funding, led by Foxconn, the electronics supplier for Apple and other tech giants. \u00a0Bill Barhydt, founder and CEO of Abra, made the announcement on October 23, 2017, at Money20/20 in Las Vegas, where he also outlined his vision for how consumer product companies will use Bitcoin in the future. Other investors in the round include Silver Capital and IGNIA, as well as previous investors Arbor Ventures, American Express Ventures, Jungle Ventures, Lerer Hippeau and RRE Ventures. Total funding to date for the company now stands at nearly $35 million.\u201cWe believe that Abra represents the future of digital payments and banking,\u201d Jack Lee, founding managing partner at HCM, the investment arm of Foxconn, said in a statement, adding that Abra could potentially usher in a new era of financial inclusion to billions of people. In speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Barhydt explained that Abra plans to use the funds to expand globally and invest in future product development. \u201cWe have a lot of project announcements we will be making on a rolling basis,\u201d he said. Three-Part VisionThough Barhydt did not offer exact details on what Abra\u2019s new products will be, he did drop several hints in his three-part vision for how consumer products will implement Bitcoin in the future. The first part, he explained, involves cross-border and consumer payments, which he said has been Abra\u2019s focus for a couple of years now.The second part involves using Bitcoin as an investment vehicle, in which smart contracts built on top of Bitcoin\u2019s ledger would enable more complicated if-then types of financial transactions \u2014 payments that go through only if specific conditions are met.Abra already relies on smart contracts to hold fiat currency and manage bitcoin price fluctuations, Barhydt explained.He went on to describe the third part of his vision: \u201cA new model of consumer asset finance,\u201d which he said is where consumer product companies like Foxconn enter into the picture.It was an idea that he conceived while recently traveling to Africa. There, he saw how a company was leasing solar panels to people who were making regular micro-payments via M-Pesa, a mobile money transfer service.\u201cThey give solar kits to people who use them only if they make a weekly lease payment from M-Pesa wallet,\u201d he explained. If a borrower does not make the payment, a SIM card in the phone communicates with the battery in the solar panel, shutting it off.His idea was to extend the concept to other consumer appliances, like refrigerators, flat-panel TVs and washing machines, that people in developing countries struggle to afford.\u201cUsing this model of embedding this cellular technology combined with a Bitcoin-based payment system like Abra, you now have a new model where people can do instant on-lease payments,\u201d he said, calling it a \u201cnew trillion-dollar business\u201d that can only be done on scale using something like Bitcoin. Continuing to remain tight-lipped about future product launches, Barhydt said, \u201cOur goal is to be the best digital currency wallet in the world for the average consumer, starting with real cash and bitcoin, and we\u2019ll see how it evolves from there.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 23}

Major Tom continues to fight the Phoenix Club and archenemy Carter Potsdam, now on the loose as another download. You won\u2019t find other spoilers here, so you are warmly encouraged to read the book.Blockchain technology takes center stage in Manney\u2019s near future and is inherent in most real estate, trade, barter, identity, gambling and other transactions. There are many global blockchains used by different people and entities for various purposes, ranging from mainstream (but definitely not to be trusted) blockchains operated by Big Business and Big Government (China is still in the lead) to \u201cseveral uncorrupted blockchains out there, not manipulated by governments and multinational institutions.\u201d Some of these independent blockchains are very popular, and their currencies are widely used.\u201cIn (ID)entity, blockchains are used for more than the multiple world currencies they underpin,\u201d Manney told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBut their use is not uniform around the world, because a Gibsonian future is never evenly distributed. Some record news, other government records. I posit that there\u2019s a greater malleability to blockchain technology than traditional evangelists admit. Because nothing online is safe. Ever. China could, at any minute, decide to launch a 51 percent attack. Probability or likelihood doesn\u2019t matter when you\u2019re dealing with large system failure. It\u2019s the possibility that counts.\u201dManney doesn\u2019t describe herself as a techno-optimist or techno-pessimist but as a techno-realist. \u201cIn this case, I show how cryptos and the blockchain could go completely wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cI also hope it\u2019s a call to make cryptos and the blockchain safer and more independent from outside manipulation. That\u2019s my goal in all that I write about: find the potentials for bad use and make it a cautionary tale that will help fix it for the future.\u201dScience fiction is perhaps at its best when it embeds important issues in a compelling narrative that encourages the reader to try and find ways to connect science fictional extrapolations to current discussion. Manney\u2019s fiction can stimulate us to preempt undesirable patterns in the evolution of key technologies, such as nanotech, artificial intelligence, consciousness downloading (often dubbed \u201cmind uploading\u201d) and blockchain technology. It\u2019s wise to bear in mind that everything can, and will, be exploited for bad ends.\u201cI admit to a certain amount of handwaving, common to all SF [science fiction], when it includes technologies still in development,\u201d continued Manney. \u201cI assume that blockchains will best be maintained outside of nation-states and proliferate into many aspects of life. And given that proliferation, ways will be found to corrupt them. I can\u2019t tell you how: I don\u2019t code. But that\u2019s the history of all technologies. As much as their creators believe in their world-changing positive properties, they also turn blind eyes to their corruption.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 23}

You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nBitGive Foundation, a nonprofit organization, announced the launch of the beta version of GiveTrack, a blockchain-based platform that allows donors to donate bitcoin to charitable causes and track those donations in real time.Connie Gallippi, founder of BitGive, made the announcement on October 24, 2017 at Money20/20, a four-day payments and finance event in Las Vegas.\u201cIt is a real working version; this will be the first time that it has gone live for anyone to access it,\u201d Gallippi said of the platform in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.One issue with charities is donors never know for sure how much of the funds they give actually make it to the intended cause. GiveTrack solves that problem by bringing transparency to the donation process. By using Bitcoin and blockchain technology, the web-based project allows donors to give to a cause and then track the progress of those funds in real-time, thereby reducing opportunities for fraud.Now that GiveTrack is officially up and running for the first time, users can begin trying the platform out by contributing to projects featured on the GiveTrack website. However, the user interface on the web-based app is still bare bones.\u201cThis is a minimal viable product. Essentially, instead of it being a prototype, it is an actual working product, but it is very basic. It doesn\u2019t have a lot of bells and whistles,\u201d Gallippi explained. \u201cWe will be doing small improvements along the way when we have feedback for things we can fix quickly.\u201dTwo Working PilotsAlong with the launch of the GiveTrack platform, the landing page of the GiveTrack website will feature two pilot projects from long-standing nonprofit partners: Medic Mobile and The Water Project, along with a description of what each project is raising funds for. Medic Mobile, a nonprofit that creates mobile apps to allow community health workers to better coordinate care, is raising money for a project to monitor and facilitate timely treatment of malnourished children in Desa Ban, Bali. The Water Project is raising money to build a new rain catchment tank and latrines at Chandolo primary school in Kenya and provide sanitation and hygiene training for the students there.Since its founding in 2013, BitGive has been partnering with international relief efforts and local charities seeking to create better communities.Gallipi explained that what sets GiveTrack apart from other blockchain-based charity platforms is its straightforward and simple approach. Instead of relying on complex smart contracts and tokens, for instance, BitGive sticks to Bitcoin.\u201cWhat we have built is really just a way to make it easier for charities and donors to interact with Bitcoin,\u201d said Gallippi. \u201cWe are not doing anything fancy or new with the tech; we are simply making it usable for donors to contribute and then to watch the money move.\u201dAs a Bitcoin donation platform, GiveTrack is also helping to spread the word about Bitcoin. \u201cWhen people who don\u2019t know much about Bitcoin hear about what we are doing, it makes [Bitcoin] more real for them,\u201d she said, \u201cthis is such a cool use case for it.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 24}

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nOverstock CEO Patrick Byrne believes that one day all company shares will be blockchain-based equity tokens classed as securities, and they will need a regulated exchange to trade on.To raise funds to develop that exchange, the online retail giant is launching an initial coin offering (ICO) for T0.com (tZero), the company\u2019s blockchain-focused subsidiary and trading platform that supports equity tokens.Byrne announced details of the ICO at Money20/20 in Las Vegas on October 24, 2017.The ICO will take place from November 15\u2013December 31 and will include the sale of 50 million tZero security tokens. Tokens will be sold in a type of presale known as a SAFT (simple agreement for future token), which limits participation to accredited investors.tZero will incorporate profit sharing features of a security as well as utility features of an app token. For instance, token holders will be able to use the tokens to pay for exchange fees. They will also receive a percentage of tZero\u2019s profits, distributed quarterly and paid into their tZero digital wallets.Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Byrne said proceeds from the ICO will go to further developing an ecosystem around tZero.He did not reveal how much Overstock hoped to raise or whether the sale would be capped or uncapped, but he said additional details would be made available around November 8.Forward ThinkingByrne has been thinking about a blockchain-based equity exchange for trading blockchain shares for some time now.Right now, most tokens are utility tokens that play some role in the distributed app they were designed to work with. Equity tokens, on the other hand, are regulated by the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and represent an actual share in a company.Byrne thinks that, eventually, most of the tokens in blockchains today will convert to equity tokens. Taking that concept a step further, he believes all company traded stocks will ultimately be issued as blockchain share certificates.Right now, however, no SEC approved exchange exists that can handle equity tokens, so Overstock is creating one.In 2015, Overstock acquired SpeedRoute, a Wall Street trade routing securities firm already licensed by the SEC. Byrne felt that building an exchange from scratch was too risky. Instead, he wanted to buy something in Wall Street that was already pre-SEC approved.SpeedRoute already had an alternative trading system (ATS) set up, so it only needed minor modifications to get it ready for selling blockchain shares. \u201cWe changed it and altered it so it could handle blockchain instruments,\u201d he said. By doing so, Overstock turned the platform into what is now tZero.To make sure the technology worked, Overstock issued its own blockchain securities last December, distributing more than 126,000 company shares via the platform. \u201cWe did it to sort of demonstrate this technology,\u201d Byrne said. \u00a0A Future of SecuritiesByrne thinks regulations coming down the pipes are going to dramatically change how tokens are traded.\u201cIf they count as securities, they need a place to trade; it has to be an SEC compliant exchange that can handle blockchain,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, there is exactly one in the world. It is tZero.\u201dEventually, he said tZero will have market makers and large pools of capital supporting it to keep the trading liquid. \u201cThe markets are very bad now in this whole crypto world. They are very sticky and illiquid markets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is really going to be just what the world of crypto needs.\u201dBut to fulfill that vision, Overstock.com will need to raise a substantial amount of capital through its tZero ICO. \u201cIt is going to take several tens of millions of dollars to build that out,\u201d Byrne explained.Overstock will likely expedite the process by purchasing some $50 million in custody and clearing firms to finish stitching together the ecosystem it needs.\u201cWe actually will make a couple acquisitions that will short the whole thing; supersize it,\u201d Byrne added.It may take a few years, but eventually, \u00a0Byrne said, the idea is to make tZero the largest exchange in the world, and the tZero ICO is a part of that.\u201cWe are thinking very big,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not just talking crypto exchange; I\u2019m talking exchange.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 25}

TokenFunder, a Toronto-based startup that helps other startups launch and manage ICOs, is the first company to win approval for an ICO by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC).While some ICOs have come under regulatory scrutiny lately, TokenFunder CEO Alan Wunsche believes that ICOs can be done right, with built-in safeguards to avoid fraud.Wunsche said in a press release issued to Bitcoin Magazine:\u201cTokenFunder has been working with the Ontario Securities Commission\u2019s LaunchPad for the past year to define an innovative funding model for businesses. Our offering will give investors the comfort of knowing that they are purchasing a security that can stand up to the scrutiny of regulation.\u201dTokenFunder ICO Launches November 1The OSC decision allows TokenFunder Inc. to launch their ICO November 1, selling FNDR tokens to retail investors who can then launch their own ICOs on TokenFunder\u2019s platform which is being built on the Ethereum blockchain.TokenFunder was given \u201crelief\u201d for a year from current regulations covering investors. This includes an exemption from registering as an investor and an exemption from a limit to the amount that can be raised in one offering. Wunsche notes that many firms using ICOs to raise investment funding are not able to verify where the funds are coming from making it risky to raise money this way. He believes that there is a safe way to use ICOs and is offering the expertise to provide investor protection within a sound regulatory framework.Like many jurisdictions around the world, the Ontario government is looking for ways to regulate ICOs without stifling innovation and driving startups to other jurisdictions.To date, some startups are holding ICOs without regulatory approval saying that their tokens or coins are not securities.What TokenFunder Is SellingTokenFunder offers an ICO process that they claim will build trust in digital finance through the use of best practices, including smart contracts to build in legal compliance and regulatory compliance to ensure that investor\u2019s rights are protected.TokenFunder offers token launch advisory services and is designed to operate within applicable securities laws and de-risk offerings and purchases of coins for both issuers and purchasers by providing, among other things, a regulatory approved platform and related support.TokenFunder co-founder Laura Pratt said in a press release:\u201cA unique feature of our FNDR token is that it lets investors share in the future success of the platform. TokenFunder has innovative KYC and AML compliance safeguards, which investors don\u2019t receive with unregulated ICOs. After the completion of our ITO, our vision is to enable other companies to launch ITO\u2019s using our platform. It is a myth that regulation is in the way... it\u2019s the right way.\u201dLaunchPad Regulatory SandboxTokenFunder is a graduate of the OSC\u2019s regulatory sandbox, part of the Canadian Securities Commission network of sandbox initiatives.LaunchPad is the Ontario sandbox with largely provincial jurisdiction but is also part of the federal securities experimental program. Its goal is to help new fintech startups work outside the current regulatory system and navigate a financial terrain that is largely based on traditional systems that may not work for new cryptocurrency and blockchain startups.The Blockchain Association of Canada (BAC) has been lobbying the province\u2019s finance minister and others for more appropriate regulations for the new digital age.Executive Director Kyle Kemper, on behalf of the BAC told Bitcoin Magazine:\"This is a first step in building a common understanding between all stakeholders around the potential, risks and opportunities of the token economy.\u201cThis ruling demonstrates that the OSC is adapting to a changing landscape and recognizes the need to support entrepreneurs leveraging blockchain technology.

Blockchain is a chain of blocks of encrypted information that form a database or \u2018ledger,\u2019 which may eventually lessen the need for the intermediary platforms that currently approve, clear, and settle payments.While very limited in current mainstream payments, the bitcoin \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 was developed as an alternative payment system that eliminates the need for a centralized institution to approve payment transactions.

For instance, in 2014, houses in Bali and Kansas, each over $500,000 in value, as well as a house in California ($1.6 million), were sold for bitcoins. In the near future, the blockchain would be used not only in terms of payment in cryptocurrency, but also for transferring conventional (fiat) money and national digital currencies issued by central banks.Property, Transaction and Title Ledgers Information on real estate, transactions, title registration, property encumbrances and their condition can be entered into distributed ledgers that are accessible online and through mobile apps. Several countries have already launched pilot projects to test such systems. For instance, Sweden has been evaluating the potential of using blockchain technology in managing its land registry since 2016.Each property would have its own blockchain ID with all its technical characteristics specified. Among other things, this would make property appraisal easier and quicker, as each transaction currently requires correspondent documents to be ordered anew and these Bureau of Technical Inventory (BTI) certificates are not always trustworthy. It is also likely for that there will be portals and MLS databases with properties that have blockchain IDs.Smart ContractsSmart contracts are transactions and other agreements concluded entirely digitally whose execution (i.e. transfer of ownership) is guaranteed by computer protocols with no human involvement. The same protocols automatically check the transaction possibility and legitimacy; they will not allow the agreement to be concluded if its terms do not meet established standards.The idea of smart contracts dates back to the 1990s, but blockchain and similar technologies can make smart contracts safer and more reliable. Property sales and rental transactions can be realized through such contracts. In September 2016, Deloitte announced the launch of a pilot project for registering rental transactions via the blockchain in association with the City of Rotterdam and the Cambridge Innovation Center.Escrow accounts are often used in buying and leasing real estate. For instance many landlords in the United States require their tenants to place a rental deposit in an escrow account, from which the money cannot be withdrawn without the landlord\u2019s permission. Today, escrow accounts are primarily held by notaries and banks, but distributed ledgers can change the situation. For instance, buyers can place their money in a blockchain escrow account. After commissioning the new build and the buyer getting the right of ownership, the money would automatically be released to the developer via a smart contract.Voting Owners of flats in apartment buildings often make decisions affecting shared infrastructure, such as major repairs or works on common areas, by voting. Distributed ledger technologies would guarantee reliable remote voting and give owners the certainty that their votes have been registered correctly. The blockchain would also prove useful in other situations, such as when real estate decisions are made by voting, for instance, in unitholder or stockholder voting.Practical Benefits of Distributed LedgersWith the adoption of the blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, real estate activities would become easier, quicker and cheaper. The market would also be rid of unnecessary intermediaries, becoming safer, more transparent and, consequently, more liquid.Lower Transaction CostsAccording to British bank Barclays, the world\u2019s first trade using blockchain technology took place in September 2016, when Barclays, Israeli startup Wave and Irish dairy producer Ornua carried out a $100,000 letter of credit transaction as collateral for exporting a parcel of Ornua cheese and butter to the Seychelles Trading Company. The transaction was completed in less than four hours instead of the 7 to 10 days it usually takes because of long document processing times.SpeedInstead of weeks and months, the time needed for paperwork to close real estate transactions would be reduced to hours or even minutes. Cross-border fund transfers and conversions would be quicker and cheaper, and technical operating costs related to the transfer of ownership would be reduced. Transactions would also become cheaper. For instance, there would be no need to pay a notary or transaction registration fee, which now account for 1 percent to 2 percent of the property price.SafetyTo falsify an existing distributed ledger entry, one would need to hack every computer on which a copy of the ledger is stored, and this number can be enormous (e.g. the number of bitcoin users is estimated at several million). The entries cannot be deleted or modified post factum, which significantly reduces the opportunities for fraud and embezzlement.Transparency and Liquidity Using open blockchain-based ledgers, sellers and buyers would gain customisable access to all documents related to a transaction and be able to check the accuracy and authenticity of every one of them. This increase in transparency and liquidity would make real estate a more liquid investment vehicle and may lead to a stronger capital inflow.Smart contracts may also stimulate the development of collective investments as they provide almost infinite opportunities for structuring property and investment project rights, which enable the construction of different crowdfunding formats. In addition, the active development of collective cross-border investments would be strengthened by voting mechanisms using blockchain-based identification, the reduction of capital structuring and transaction costs and the absence of governmental restrictions on the withdrawal of funds.For example, Tranio is working on a crowdfunding project that will enable crypto capital owners to enter into club transactions along with conventional clients. Private investors will be able to realise the strategies of capital maintenance and earning on real estate, avoiding banks and their commissions by using the blockchain to conclude agreements, transfer money and, consequently, receive higher incomes.Problems With the Blockchain and Digital CurrenciesThe distributed ledger industry is still at the start of its development, and its implementation in the real estate market is still problematic.Absence of Regulation The capabilities of the technology are ahead of governmental regulation, and no legal framework has yet been created to regulate the implementation of blockchain technology. Many advantages of distributed ledgers will only be able to materialize as soon as there is such a framework in place allowing for the defense of smart contracts and other blockchain operations in court.High Costs of Converting Conventional (Fiat) Capital to Cryptocurrency and Vice VersaThe commissions charged on transferring to Mastercard or Visa range between 0.5 percent and 5 percent. This issue is likely to be resolved over time. However, this is likely to shrink over time. Several startups are already claiming they will be able to reduce the commission to zero.Know-Your-Customer (KYC) Requirements Crypto-capital owners are likely to be subject to standard,\u00a0source of funds verification procedures, which are technically difficult to accomplish today. Banks, obliged to check the origin of funds by law, are not ready to work with cryptocurrency owners yet. In the case of collective investments, the absence of bank regulation and compliance potentially allows developers and any fund recipients to collect money at a lower cost and not to be bound by obligations. However, this presents risks, in particular, dishonest developers.High VolatilityThe high volatility of cryptocurrencies would restrain investment in the real estate market for some time: development projects in good locations yield about 15 percent per annum (and rental projects yield even less \u2014 about 5 percent on average), while Bitcoin exchange rates surge by 100 to 200 percent over small periods of time. At the same time, the constant growth leads to cryptocurrencies losing their stability, an important payment instrument characteristic. They begin to look something like stocks of a rapidly growing company. Few might want to sell stocks that rise in price today if tomorrow they are likely to rise even more.However, in my opinion, some people earning on cryptocurrencies would soon want to partly invest their capital in a simpler, more real and reliable vehicle: real estate. This is the nature of human psychology. Those people who earn on growing markets want to invest some part of their money in more stable assets and vice versa. Eventually, lower regulatory barriers and lower transaction costs will enable crypto capital to become a powerful driver for cross-border real estate investment transactions, allowing investors to increase their yields. Successful startups would then be able to compete with established real estate funds.According to forecasts by consulting company Accenture, in 2018\u20132024, the blockchain will span many different types of assets, and by 2025 it will be a mass phenomenon and an indispensable part of global capital flows. \u201cIt is already clear that, within this revolution, the advent of distributed ledger technologies is starting to disrupt many of the existing ways of doing business\u201d, the company said in its report for the UK Government Office for Science. This advent will surely result in positive transformations not only in the real estate market but in all sectors of the economy.\nGeorge Kachmazov is the founder and managing partner of Tranio.com.

Since July 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has regularly begun asserting itself in this space. It has taken various actions against several companies relating to their Initial Coin Offerings, or \u201cICOs,\u201d or other cryptocurrency activities. It investigated The DAO, an online corporation, and declared that its ICO involved securities subject to regulation under federal securities laws. It also suspended trading in the stock of four other companies due to concerns over the accuracy of public information relating to their cryptocurrency activities. What does this trend mean for the industry? Looking more closely at the SEC\u2019s actions, the answer is: to be vigilant but not paranoid.The DAO LegacyFederal securities laws generally require that instruments constituting \u201csecurities\u201d are registered with the SEC in order to protect investors by ensuring public access to key information needed for making an informed investment decision. On July 25, 2017, the SEC issued a Report of Investigation on The DAO, concluding that DAO Tokens sold in its ICO were \u201cinvestment contracts\u201d and therefore securities that should have been registered. The DAO (short for Decentralized Autonomous Organization) sold over one billion DAO Tokens in exchange for ether. The proceeds were to be used to fund various \u201cprojects\u201d once they were vetted and approved by Curators, who were selected by The DAO\u2019s founders. DAO Token holders could vote on which projects to fund, and profits from those projects would be distributed among Token holders. Applying the Howey test (named for the Supreme Court case that announced it), which says that something is an investment contract if it involves (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the managerial efforts of others, the SEC found that DAO Tokens were securities because:Purchasing DAO Tokens in exchange for ether constituted an \u201cinvestment of money\u201d;A \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d existed because the ether was pooled and used to fund projects aimed at making profits, which would be distributed to DAO Token holders; andDAO Token holders expected these profits from the efforts of The DAO founders and Curators, who, among other things, created and monitored The DAO and vetted potential projects. While Token holders could vote on which projects to fund, they were still essentially relying on others, because they could vote only after projects had been curated. Although these findings applied only to The DAO, the SEC noted that it wanted \u201cto stress that the U.S. federal securities law may apply to various activities, including distributed ledger technology, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, without regard to the form of the organization or technology used to effectuate a particular offer or sale.\u201d This declaration undoubtedly foreshadows continued investigations and enforcement actions relating to ICOs. Trading SuspensionsFederal law authorizes the SEC to suspend trading in a company\u2019s stock summarily for up to 10 business days when needed to protect investors or in the public interest. In a recent Investor Alert, the SEC explained that such suspensions may result from a \u201clack of current, accurate, or adequate information about the company\u201d; \u201cquestions about the accuracy of publicly available information\u201d concerning the company\u2019s \u201coperational status and financial condition\u201d; or \u201cquestions about trading in the stock.\u201d In the cryptocurrency context, the SEC is especially concerned about scams in which companies \u201cpublicly announc[e] ICO or coin/token related events to affect the price of the company\u2019s common stock.\u201d It warned specifically about two red flags signaling possible \u201cICO-related fraud\u201d: companies whose stock is trading that (1) claim without explanation that their ICO is \u201cSEC-compliant\u201d or (2) \u201cpurport[] to raise capital through an ICO or take on ICO-related business described in vague or nonsensical terms or using undefined technical or legal jargon.\u201d In August 2017, the SEC issued 10-day suspension orders in shares of four companies due to concerns relating to public statements about their cryptocurrency activities and ICOs. First, on August 3, the SEC suspended trading in shares of Strategic Global Investments, Inc., over questions regarding the accuracy of statements in certain press releases relating to \u201cthe activities of the company with respect to [ICOs].\u201d Each of the cited press releases touted generally that the company planned to sponsor \u201cSEC compliant ICOs.\u201d Next, on August 9, the SEC issued a temporary trading ban in shares of CIAO Group (recently renamed as NuMelo Technology) due to questions regarding the accuracy of various public statements relating to certain business plans and a planned ICO. The cited press releases, including those from March 16, June 15 and July 6, contained vague statements that CIAO planned to invest in telecommunications projects in emerging markets and to facilitate the provision of financial services to developing nations through blockchain technology, including through an ICO. On August 23, the SEC suspended trading in shares of First Bitcoin Capital Corp., a company involved in developing digital currencies and other blockchain technology, due to \u201cconcerns regarding the accuracy and adequacy of publicly available information about the company including, among other things, the value of [its] assets and its capital structure.\u201d Finally, on August 24, the SEC issued a suspension order against American Security Resources Corp. (renamed to Bitcoin Crypto Currency Exchange Corp.) due to statements in press releases \u201cconcerning, among other things, the company\u2019s business transition to the cryptocurrency markets and early adoption of blockchain technology.\u201d These press releases from August 1 and August 8 announced vaguely that the company was \u201center[ing] the booming Crypto currency markets,\u201d developing a mobile cryptocurrency trading application and acquiring a company that had created \u201ca smartphone-based payment and money transfer system.\u201d The SEC\u2019s suspension orders did not specify the language or facts triggering its action, but each of these companies appears to have strayed into the red-flag territory the SEC has identified. Its oversight in this area will thus likely continue and be directed at preventing fraud and improving disclosures to investors on new or not-well-understood technologies.Implications for the Cryptocurrency IndustryThis recent flurry of SEC activity should be taken seriously by the cryptocurrency industry because it is only the start. The SEC will continue to monitor businesses involved with cryptocurrencies. Companies considering engaging in ICOs should therefore carefully consider and seek legal advice regarding whether their tokens possess characteristics that might make them resemble securities. They should also consult counsel when preparing public statements relating to their cryptocurrency activities or assets. Anyone predicting the beginning-of-the-end for the industry based on these events, however, is overreacting. As more businesses become engaged in cryptocurrency-related activities, more people will buy tokens or invest in companies innovating within the cryptocurrency space, which ignites regulators\u2019 investor-protection instincts. While the SEC has bared its teeth where it perceived a threat to investors, it has not demonstrated aggression toward the industry as a whole. Indeed, the SEC was careful not to say that ICOs categorically involve securities; it cautioned only that whether a token is a security depends on the \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d of each case. That the SEC is watching the cryptocurrency industry is thus a symptom of the industry\u2019s success, not a sign of its demise.This is a guest post by Jeffrey Alberts and Yvonne Saadi of\u00a0 Pryor Cashman's\u00a0Financial Institutions\u00a0Group.

One of its primary resources is oil, and consequently, many companies take advantage of the region. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the oil industry has been a key factor in Nigeria\u2019s economy for 50 years. As a result of oil drilling and spills by Shell and other companies, however, the land has been devastated, the vegetation decimated, fish numbers depleted, and surrounding mangroves, swamps and creeks contaminated. Consequently, the livelihoods of many fishermen and farmers have been destroyed.In 2011, the UNEP said that it could take up to 30 years for full environmental restoration to be achieved in Ogoniland; but a lack of accountability appears to have stalled progress as corruption and violence spread, and mistrust continues to grow between the people and the government.Cleaning up the Niger Delta remains a key focal point for Chinyere Nnadi, founder and CEO of Sustainability International, a U.S.-based nonprofit that provides innovative solutions to complex sustainability and conservation issues in the developing world. Sustainability International\u2019s current large-scale initiative hopes to revitalize the region through its Clean Up Niger Delta Project. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Nnadi, whose family comes from Nigeria, said that it\u2019s important to understand the full scope of this Gordian knot before reaching a resolution, and to raise awareness around the effects caused by the oil pollution.\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve taken numerous meetings [with] local villages, government officials, and oil and gas companies to fully understand each stakeholder\u2019s concerns and challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring this process, the situation became more volatile and dangerous with rising ethnic tensions and youth violence.\u201dNnadi explains that since Nigeria fell into recession a year and a half ago, violence and unrest have risen sharply in the region. Several militant groups comprising of disaffected youth with no job prospects were regularly bombing oil pipelines until a truce in September 2016. In one explosion alone, Shell lost $7 billion. The Nigerian federal government is estimated to have lost $100 million in oil revenue from the oil and gas pipeline bombings as it lost control over the Niger Delta region.\u201cThe truce ended two weeks ago and the Nigerian army and navy have entered the region to protect the oil and gas assets and combat the militants,\u201d explained Nnadi. \u201cIn the last two weeks there have been multiple killings and kidnappings.\u201dNnadi says that there has never been a cleanup of the oil spills in the Niger Delta, culminating in 50 years of neglect and lack of accountability among oil and gas companies, wealthy elites and the government. Consequently, as sentiment is changing toward solving the problem, all the parties \u2014 the government, oil companies and the community \u2014 no longer trust each other, says Nnadi.\u201cThis presented the opportunity to experiment with the blockchain at the community level,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have their trust, and that is what is most important at the moment.\u201dAs such, Sustainability International is planning to launch multiple controlled pilots in one village over the next year. Nnadi said they will conduct interviews with the villagers to determine the best design application for the people. They will then use their findings to develop the alpha version of mobile and desktop applications before executing cleanup number two, employing \u201cwetware\u201d \u2014 human know-how merged with advanced technology.\u201cOur pilots will begin with one farm, then expand the cleanups to multiple farms at a time by the third cleanup, using hardware and blockchain [technology] to efficiently execute multiple cleanups,\u201d he said. \u201cUsing decentralization, we will enable distributed data collection and secure payments to villages, engineering accountability, economic inclusion and community engagement.\u201dThrough the blockchain, Sustainability International will be able to micropay community members as they build credibility through its reputation system that rewards honest work. It\u2019s hoped that this will rewire a society that is rampant with bribery and corruption. In turn, interaction with international NGOs that are seeking to engage with young entrepreneurs and community leaders in Africa\u2019s largest country will be made easier.Sustainability International has teamed up with the Blockchain for Social Impact Coalition (BSIC), an initiative started by ConsenSys.Ben Siegel, impact policy manager at ConsenSys, told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0that the blockchain aspect of Sustainability International\u2019s project creates an added level of trust in the platform.\u201cThe individuals on the ground don\u2019t need to trust each other; they just need to trust the platform/system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt reduces the fear of corruption that can sometimes drive people away from integrity.\u201dSustainability International and the blockchain coalition will use smart contracts to prevent corruption and return trust back to Ogoniland.\u201cWith smart contracts and cryptocurrency, we can create \u2018programmable money,\u2019 which allows us to then \u2018program\u2019 human actions,\u201d added Siegel. \u201cIf we incentivize people to continuously perform a series of tasks in order to receive a sustained flow of funds, we might be able to create a system in which the most likely \u2018corrupt\u2019 actors are incentivized for not being corrupt.\u201dThis means that if Shell were to allocate a set amount of money to clean up an oil spill, the money wouldn\u2019t be released to the contractor until the work has been verified as complete. Through smart contracts, the contractors and the community would monitor the cleanup, with each submitting data to show efficacy of work. The community would also be trained in International Sustainability standards, in which multiple factors of authentication are needed on the data submission to ensure secure data is used, Nnadi explained.\u201cWe also run a sentiment tracker and smartphones in the entire community throughout the length of the project to have an extra level of confirmation and community engagement,\u201d added Nnadi.Nnadi expects the cleanup will be a massive development opportunity for local communities.\u201cThe central thesis of this technology experiment is that the government and oil companies should pay the people to perform the cleanup,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that instead of the money being spent on foreigners to come in intermittently to check on the cleanup, that local decentralized data collection will provide cheaper real-time monitoring for the oil companies and governments.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 3}
{"title": "Central Banks and the IMF Warm Up to (Centralized) Digital Currencies", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/central-banks-and-imf-warm-centralized-digital-currencies/", "birthday": "Oct 5, 2017  3:56 PM EST", "date": "2017-10-05 20:56:00", "content": "Sweden\u2019s central bank, the Riksbank, is considering whether the country should introduce a purely digital form of government-backed money, perhaps using distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) similar to the blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin. This move is part of a recent trend: around the world, nations are considering cryptocurrencies issued by central banks; and recently, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave a speech hinting at its interest in the concept.A September 2017 report titled \u201cThe Riksbank\u2019s e-krona project\u201d outlines a proposal for a digital complement to cash, dubbed e-krona, which would be guaranteed by the state. \u201cThis is as revolutionary as the paper note 300 years ago,\u201d Cecilia Skingsley, deputy governor at the Riksbank, told the Financial Times in November 2016. \u201cWhat does it mean for monetary policy and financial stability? How do we design this: a rechargeable card, an app or another way?\u201d Skingsley added that the type of technology to be used is under discussion.\u201cWith regard to DLT including blockchain technology, this is relatively new and untried technology that does not yet have any applications similar to the e-krona described in the report,\u201d states the new Riksbank report. \u201cConsiderable research and development is being performed in DLT and many central banks are making efforts to research the technology, but there are only a few more significant DLT applications currently in production. This is partly due to the technology being so new and to it having some weaknesses, such as limitations in performance and a lack of standards and regulations. Development in DLT is progressing incredibly rapidly, however, and many major players are taking part in it.\u201dThe report notes that an important difference between cryptocurrencies and fiat currency is that a cryptocurrency that is not backed by a central bank has no inherent value but only speculative value, which implies a high volatility.According to the Riksbank, a digital central bank currency should work as a means of payment, unit of account and store of value. The proposed e-krona, targeted at the general public, combines these three functions. In particular, since the e-krona is a claim on the Riksbank and guaranteed by the government, it also fulfils the function as a store of value. The report assumes that the e-krona will be broadly available to the general public, but states that \u201cit will not necessarily be a cryptocurrency, as this will depend on the choice of technology.\u201d\u201cA cryptocurrency issued by a central bank can either be made available to a broad general public or limited to large and time-critical payments between banks,\u201d continues the Riksbank report. \u201cIf anonymity is not a decisive/desirable quality of the currency, the general public can instead be given access to accounts with the central bank to obtain access to cash in digital form.\u201dReading between the lines, it seems evident that the Riksbank does not consider anonymous transactions as a desirable feature, and would insist on filtering and managing the citizens\u2019 access to a possible blockchain-based implementation of the e-krona. Of course, there\u2019s nothing surprising here. The Riksbank\u2019s move is partly motivated by the fact that the use of cash in Sweden is rapidly falling, with more and more people using private and often mobile e-payment means. The e-krona could be an alternative to private e-payment providers, but anonymity is not one of the features of cash that the central bank wants to emulate. On the contrary, the e-krona, especially if blockchain-based, would give the government the means to easily monitor all transactions.Global Interest in National Digital CurrenciesThe Riksbank isn\u2019t the only central bank to consider issuing its own digital currency. The central banks of Singapore, Papua New Guinea, Canada and others are considering similar moves. A recent research paper issued by the Bank of Canada, which considers a possible Bitcoin standard similar to the gold standard, is especially interesting. Even China\u2019s central bank is cautiously testing a digital currency.The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), an international financial organization owned by 60 member central banks, has published a paper titled \u201cCentral bank cryptocurrencies\u201d in its BIS Quarterly Review.The paper makes a distinction between a \u201cretail\u201d central bank cryptocurrency (CBCC) and a \u201cwholesale\u201d one that would be used only by banks, and concludes that all central banks may eventually have to decide whether issuing retail or wholesale CBCCs makes sense in their own context. Here again, anonymity isn\u2019t likely to be considered as a desirable feature, unless the citizens really want it. \u201cThe main benefit that a consumer-facing retail CBCC would offer, over the provision of public access to (centralized) central bank accounts, is that the former would have the potential to provide the anonymity of cash,\u201d argues the BIS paper.Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), gave a speech at a Bank of England conference titled \u201cCentral Banking and Fintech \u2014 A Brave New World?\u201dLagarde uses the term \u201cvirtual currency\u201d essentially as a synonym of \u201ccryptocurrency.\u201d According to Lagarde, virtual currencies such as bitcoin pose little or no challenge to the existing order because they are too volatile, too risky, too energy intensive and because the underlying technologies are not yet scalable. \u201cMany are too opaque for regulators; and some have been hacked,\u201d she added.On the other hand, continued Lagarde, current technical challenges could be solved and the use of virtual currencies could grow exponentially, especially in countries with weak institutions and unstable national currencies. Virtual currency could also open the door to better payment services and new models of financial intermediation.\u201c[Citizens] may one day prefer virtual currencies, since they potentially offer the same cost and convenience as cash \u2014 no settlement risks, no clearing delays, no central registration, no intermediary to check accounts and identities,\u201d concluded Lagarde. \u201cIf privately issued virtual currencies remain risky and unstable, citizens may even call on central banks to provide digital forms of legal tender.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 5}
{"title": "Op Ed: A Roadmap For How the Blockchain Can Open Up Foreign Property Investment", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-roadmap-how-blockchain-can-open-foreign-property-investment/", "birthday": "Oct 6, 2017 1:35 PM EST", "date": "2017-10-06 18:35:00", "content": "For most individuals, investing in foreign property seems out of reach. The barriers, however, have far less to do with one\u2019s income and more to do with issues around information, namely quality and verifiability. It is not just the cost of property but also the expense in hiring local advisers that makes foreign real estate a rich man\u2019s game.Blockchain technology has the potential to significantly lower these barriers, making property investment a viable option for a larger swathe of the population. In short, distributed ledgers can provide greater transparency into the availability, detail and oversight of properties in more inaccessible areas. Tokenization makes real estate investments more liquid and divisible among a greater number of people \u2014 an attribute that greatly reduces transaction costs and increases economies of scale.The various levels of complexity are the reason why foreign real estate investors often resort to hiring local advisers. The costs incurred in hiring local advisers or services can add up to more than the actual property. As business lawyer, economist and Brickblock.io adviser Dr. Wolfgang Richter notes, \u201cThe various fees make it unfeasible for people to invest small amounts; thus, investing is only advantageous for those with a lot of capital.\u201d The decentralized, fluid and incorruptible nature of blockchain technology may present a solution to the barriers that aspiring property investors are confronted with. Providing a Trusted, Verifiable Source of Data by Demystifying InformationAs it stands, one of the greatest challenges for potential investors is understanding whether a property is appropriate for investment.Investors may see a property they like \u2014 but how can they understand whether the financial, cultural and security prospects of the surrounding area fit their risk profile? And how can they trust that the information is even correct? Ensuring the accuracy of data and overcoming language barriers makes this process extremely difficult.The same goes for valuations \u2014 how verifiable are they? How is a potential buyer who hasn\u2019t set foot in the country meant to ensure that the current value is fair?Companies and advisers interested in widening their client pool to international investors can collect, store and present critical information to individuals in a clear and transparent fashion. According to Richter, this information includes \u201ca thorough description of the assets, including a valuation by an external expert, as well as documentation that demonstrates a credible management structure.\u201d In essence, the distributed ledger eliminates much of the complexity of compiling, verifying and ensuring the integrity of real estate data.Eliminating the Need for Costly Trustee and Company Structures Most trustee and company structures exist solely to hold and maintain records. Ensuring that the appropriate data is filed, maintained and accurate \u2014 especially as requirements differ across each country \u2014 requires extensive resources.However, with blockchain technology, all data concerning the investment deal and ongoing valuation can be stored in a decentralized database where it can\u2019t be altered or manipulated. Between not having to pay high marketing fees for documentation and additional costs to store and verify information, investors have more cash to park in their investments.Reducing the Need for Local Finances and AdministrationTokenization enables real estate investments to be divided and translated into digital tokens. Tokens can be distributed and traded between investors without any need to transfer into local currency. The ability to buy and sell property via tokens eliminates the need for local bank accounts, which often require a high initial deposit from foreign individuals or are outright impossible to open due to residence requirements. Thanks to the nature of borderless cryptocurrencies, the size of local documentation is vastly reduced \u2014 further lowering administration costs. In addition, follow-up transactions for investors can be handled easily because of the liquid nature of the tokens and because of the transparency afforded by the distributed ledger.Transforming Real Estate Into a More Liquid Asset Tokenization also turns a somewhat illiquid asset into a highly liquid one. Tokens can be traded or liquidated much more easily and rapidly than an individual property or shares in a typical real estate fund. Opening Up Accessibility to a Wider Variety of Foreign Real EstateDividing up a real estate investment into smaller-sized tokens not only makes it more cost-effective to invest in foreign property, but also enables investors to deploy their capital across more properties. As the amount required to invest can be low, individuals can spread out risk by investing in a variety of tokenized real estate offerings. A blockchain-backed platform investing in foreign real estate is nascent, not exotic. As companies or advisers build up track records, grading systems aligned to the data in the distributed ledger can help individuals evaluate the risk associated with specific offerings. Investors will be able to gauge the aptitude of potential real estate investments as easily as they do stocks or bonds. \u201cRegulation will help this process along,\u201d says Richter. Of course, regulators are still getting their heads around the necessary oversight for tokenization structures. There are also questions about tax issues. Yet, as Richter notes, \u201cThere are already structures available based on other types of existing offerings which can provide guidance.\u201dAll in all, blockchain technology stands to open up a wider variety of foreign real estate assets to a larger proportion of the population. While some may feel that investing in property may not make sense for those with less capital than today\u2019s investors, the reality is that real estate \u2014 like other real assets \u2014 can help offset volatile currencies or inflation.

{"title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: There May Still Be Some Life in These Exhausted Bulls", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-price-analysis-there-may-still-be-some-life-these-exhausted-bulls/", "birthday": "Oct 6, 2017 5:46 PM EST", "date": "2017-10-06 22:46:00", "content": "Over the last week, the BTC-USD market has seen some major price swings. At one point, the price nearly reached $4500 only to see it pull back down to the low $4100s. And now, within two days, the price has topped back out in the low $4400s. There has been some major chop and seemingly erratic dumps and price hikes, but overall there seems to be a common upward trent within the macro market movements:Figure 1: BTC-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Macro TrendSince the bottom of the bear run last month, bitcoin has seen several rallies that have continued along a generally positive trend. The figure above shows a trend of higher highs, higher lows and an upper/lower boundary that is converging. This type of price activity is called a rising wedge. Coupled with this price growth is a trend of decreasing volume throughout the length of the wedge. A rising wedge is generally a bearish trend that shows weakening bullish pressure as each subsequent rally becomes smaller and smaller. As the price corrects, there are rallies that bring the price to new highs, but ultimately rally on smaller and smaller volume. As of the time of this article, the latest rally has failed to make a new high in the low $4400s. A breakdown of this wedge could lead to a substantial price drop of approximately $500 below the point of breakdown. The approximate price target would be around $3700.Although rising wedges are bearish in nature, that doesn\u2019t mean new highs aren\u2019t in store for bitcoin. The macro trend is currently showing a potential bearish move, but there is still some strength in the market. The market is currently trending above the 50 EMA and 200 EMA which, by many standards, is representative of a trending bullish market. Although the price is trending upward and the overall EMA signals are showing potential upward continuation, there are pretty clear signs of bullish exhaustion on the macro scale:Figure 2: BTC-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Bullish ExhaustionAs stated earlier, the rising wedge is paired with decreasing volume which is a clear giveaway that upward momentum is waning. To complement this exhaustion, the RSI and MACD are showing clear signs of bearish divergence in the current market and are demonstrating a lack of the bullish momentum necessary to sustain a bull market. If the rising wedge breaks to the bottom, we can expect the support levels to lie on the Fibonacci Retracement values shown above. The ultimate price target of the rising wedge would have BTC-USD testing the 50% retracement values. On a very, very macro scale, there are clear signs of overall bullish exhaustion since the beginning of its run from the low $1000s:Figure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Week Candles, Bitfinex, Macro Bullish ExhaustionTwo very clear indicators of bullish momentum loss lie on the RSI and the MACD. The price of bitcoin has pushed to strong, new highs but it has left the momentum indicators weakening. The RSI is showing strong macro divergence, and the MACD is on the verge of flipping bearish for the first time since the ETF was denied back in April. It\u2019s not hard to argue that bitcoin has seen heavy price growth and needs a little room to breath. It is entirely possible the market won\u2019t see any strong pullback and it may go sideways. However, in the event that a sustained market pulls the price down, we can expect to find support along the midline of the Bollinger Bands in the low $3000s. It\u2019s important that the above chart and market implications of this macro divergence are occurring on candles that are one week. So, while this doesn\u2019t mean the market will just suddenly plummet, it is important to understand that a substantial price drop could be in bitcoin\u2019s future.Even though I gave plenty of bearish arguments, it should be noted that these predictions are on a macro scale, and the immediate trend is showing strong support along the 50 and 200 EMAs. The market is bullish until proven otherwise. As the saying goes: \u201cthe trend is your friend.\u201d Bitcoin has had one heck of a year so far, but I think it\u2019s important to point out the clear signs of a macro bullish exhaustion:Summary:Bitcoin is finding support and showing a bullish trend along the 50 and 200 EMAs.On a macro level, the trend is pushing upward but is showing a potential bearish move if the market breaks out of the rising wedge identified in Figure 1.A breakout of this wedge would have its price target in the $3700s.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nSilvio Micali is an MIT professor and Turing Award\u2013winning cryptographer known for his work in technologies that form the bedrock of blockchains today: public-key cryptosystems, digital signatures, pseudorandomness and multiparty computations. He is also the co-inventor of the zero-knowledge proof.In the \u201990s, he worked on Byzantine agreement, a protocol for getting nodes in a distributed system to agree on a state change. And in 2012, he and long-time collaborator Shafi Goldwasser were co-recipients of the A.M. Turing Award, essentially, the \u201cNobel Prize in computing.\u201dUpon learning about Bitcoin three years ago, Micali turned his attention from mechanism design, which had consumed him for the previous seven years, and dove headlong into creating a proof-of-stake algorithm. His project is called Algorand.Put simply, Algorand relies on a novel form of Byzantine agreement with only nine expected steps. In each step, committee members, chosen at random in a private lottery, are replaced. The result is a high-security system with a negligible risk of forks.According to Micali, recent tests show Algorand can process 2 MB blocks in 17 seconds, compared to Bitcoin, which produces a 1 MB block every 10 minutes. (A paper on these results will be presented at SOSP, the biennial ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, later this month.)In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Micali explained why he thinks proof of stake is superior to proof of work, the consensus algorithm that underlies most cryptocurrencies today, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although Ethereum, more often viewed as a smart contract platform, aims to transition to proof of stake next year. Unnecessary EvilMicali thinks proof of work was a great idea when it first came out, but now that we have seen the consequences, he calls it an \u201cunnecessary evil\u201d for several reasons. \u201cThe first time I heard about Bitcoin, I saw all the difficulties. To me, the main difficulty is the waste of computational resources. That is really appalling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt drives up prices and depletes the planet of resources.\u201d Second, he sees miners as \u201ca new center of power\u201d and an orthogonal force to the real users of the system: the coin holders. \u201cIf five mining pools can control what goes in or does not go in a block, in what sense is the ledger decentralized? You don\u2019t want miners having control over the ledger, particularly when they have low margins, are far away and accountable to no one. I think it is a recipe for disaster,\u201d he said. Finally, transaction ambiguity does not sit well with him. In Bitcoin, occasionally two blocks are found at roughly the same time, creating a temporary fork in the chain. When that happens, the branch with the greater hash power is elongated, while the other and its blocks \u201cdisappear.\u201d If your transactions happened to be in an orphaned block, it will eventually get picked up again in the main chain, but for Micali, the idea is unsettling. \u201cEvery time I see my transaction is in a block, I worry the block may disappear. But never mind anxious people like me; banks may not be willing to take on the additional risk,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you imagine a financial world where wire transfers could be taken back?\u201d \u00a0Natural DemocracyMicali thinks proof of stake is a better option. In proof of stake, there are no miners, just the coin holders. Further, a coin holder\u2019s ability to create or validate a block is based on how many coins in the system he or she owns. \u201cThis is a natural interpretation of democracy,\u201d Micali said. \u201cYour influence in maintaining the integrity of the system is based on how much you are really invested in the system.\u201d \u00a0But there is a catch: creating a proof-of-stake algorithm is hard to do. While several projects claim to have come up with a secure protocol, Micali thinks some of those claims are questionable. \u201cThe fact is, people can claim anything they want,\u201d he said. One of the biggest challenges in proof of stake is the \u201cnothing at stake\u201d problem. If the chain forks, the optimal strategy for any coin holder is to extend both chains to earn additional block rewards or to double spend. That goes against the central design goal of all blockchains: getting users to converge on a single chain. Some projects are looking at ways to sculpt their proof-of-stake protocols by adding perks or punishments to get coin holders to abide by the rules. As part of that, some proof-of-stake systems require users to put up a type of security deposit or bond.Micali feels a well-designed proof-of-stake cryptocurrency should stand on its own, however, without extra measures. He thinks bonding opens doors to bad actors. \u201cLet me ask you, what fraction of your disposable income can you put on the table and not touch?\u201d he said and suggested that honest people will put up only a small amount, ceding control to bad actors with big pockets. \u201cThe danger is that only bad people will give up control over a large amount of money to manipulate the system. And if they earn much more money by misbehaving, they will be happy to lose what they put on the table,\u201d he said.He also disagrees with the idea of using punishment to get users to fall in line. \u201cA weak state rules through threats and fear,\u201d he said, comparing the practice to barbaric punishments used by some nations to fight crime. Why do they do it? Because criminals are so rarely caught, he said. \u201cSo once they catch one, they disembowel the poor guy.\u201d He continued, \u201cDo you want to oust somebody who misbehaves? Of course. But a well organized system is one in which you don\u2019t need to punish people.\u201dBitcoin and Ethereum Most people view Bitcoin solely as a cryptocurrency, but Micali thinks the greatest value of Bitcoin and Ethereum are as enablers of smart contracts, in which users can stipulate if-then conditions around payments. \u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, doing only payments is easy,\u201d he said, adding that he did not want to trivialize the problem. \u201cOf course, decentralized payments are better than centralized payments, but what really differentiates a cryptocurrency from any other form of money is that you can actually do a smart contract.\u201d Based on that, he thinks that both Bitcoin and Ethereum would benefit from implementing the best consensus algorithm available. Currently, both systems are \u201chuffing and puffing,\u201d he said. Bitcoin is constrained to 7 transactions per second, while Ethereum can process only 15 per second, compared to Visa\u2019s 2,000 per second. \u201cIf the blockchain scales, isn\u2019t it better for Bitcoin and Ethereum? If the blockchain has a [mathematical] proof of security, isn\u2019t it better for its users?\u201d he said. \u201cIf the blockchain cannot be hijacked by miners who are accountable to nobody and live in some faraway jurisdiction, isn\u2019t that a plus for all users?\u201d Micali thinks so.", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 9}

He covers topics in healthcare, technology, travel and culture. He holds bitcoin and ether.\nAccess to reliable energy is the foundation of economic development and human society. Yet reliable energy can come at a steep environmental cost.Today\u2019s energy systems are being rapidly reexamined and transformed by both private businesses and public organizations. Innovation coupled with changing policy and consumer demands has prompted The World Economic Forum\u2019s System Initiative On Shaping the Future of Energy. The WEF noted that four out of five of the Initiative's goals can be addressed in some way through the application of blockchain technology:Enable innovation to accelerate opportunities towards smarter and more efficient energy use; Enable the cost-effective reduction of energy\u2019s environmental footprint; Enable universal access to affordable reliable energy; andImprove system resilience and security.One area of application that has been of interest for its utility, efficiency and sustainability is the blockchain application to microgrids.MaaS in IndiaMultinational IT provider, Tech Mahindra, and the peer-to-peer based energy trading platform, Power Ledger, have created a new service for clientele specifically interested in microgrids. Microgrids are distributed energy systems that act as a single controllable entity with respect to a larger energy grid network. A microgrid\u2019s key feature is that it can connect and disconnect from a larger grid network, enabling it to operate both as a part of a larger grid or in \u201cislandmode\u201d as its own grid. The new service offering includes a package of technical services and a platform for customers to set up and operate their own microgrid called \u201cMicrogrid-as-a-Service\u201d (MaaS). The MaaS platform integrates multiple energy assets such as solar, battery storage, electric vehicle chargers and analytics to measure energy efficiency. MaaS is intended to offer resilient and reliable electricity that is also local and less carbon reliant.While the MaaS product provides technical control over a microgrid, Power Ledger\u2019s blockchain-based platform acts as an added transactional layer that reimburses users for excess clean energy produced by allowing peers to store and trade it at a local level. The blockchain also manages all energy debits and credits of accounts, automates trading and measures each participant\u2019s ongoing financial statements. The blockchain does this by tracking the data flow from smart electricity meters \u2014 an Internet of Things application for the energy sector.The Power Ledger blockchain-based software platform will begin in late 2017 as a virtual trial run on those Tech Mahindra campuses in India that are already hooked up to microgrids. \u00a0Location proves to be a key factor for the project\u2019s success based on two reasons. Data from urban microgrids are typically more complex due to population density; they can, therefore, better demonstrate the strengths of using a blockchain-based platform for microgrids. Also, urban microgrids are much more common in India as opposed to OCED countries where they are mostly employed in rural settings. \u201cTrialing in India is a major opportunity to change the way communities source the energy required to take part in a modern global economy,\u201d said Power Ledger\u2019s Managing Director, David Martin.An Economic Environment Ready for DisruptionThe fact that India\u2019s economy has been declining since the beginning of 2017 enhances the project\u2019s case for using a blockchain to improve the country\u2019s bottom line. In the first six months of 2017, the country\u2019s gross domestic product fell from 7 percent to 5.7 percent. This may be due in part to reform efforts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the last year. In June, Modi announced a complete overhaul of India\u2019s tax system. Back in November 2016, he banned the 500 rupee ($7.50) and 1,000 rupee ($15) paper notes, calling them \u201cworthless pieces of paper,\u201d as a way to limit fraud and corruption. These banned notes were said to make up about 86 percent of all cash in circulation, according to CNN Money.Opportunities for digitization using blockchain technology, and especially for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, are a much needed alternative to several of their systems that do not already have effective nodes of trust built in. Power Ledger has already proved that its platform can work for both homeowners and businesses. In Busselton, Australia, their peer-to-peer trial showed households can save about $470 ($600 AUD) per year on electricity bills. The forward vision for using blockchain-based platforms to trade energy within microgrids is to enable building owners, campuses, and even \u201csmart cities\u201d and other communities to produce and manage their own affordable electricity and then trade any excess generation.

While China and\u00a0South Korea\u00a0have recently cracked down on ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges, some nations in the European Economic Area (EEA) have become among the world\u2019s most progressive in embracing this nascent technology. Still, the lack of standards in regulation will prove to be a challenge as blockchain startups seek to develop and mature.Since consensus is easier to realize with a smaller representative body, smaller autonomous territories are more fit to effect rapid change in promoting the establishment of crypto and blockchain companies in their legal jurisdictions. For example, the cantonal laws in Switzerland allow for increased agility when introducing amendments, disclosure and transparency.Switzerland has emerged as a European hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain development. These efforts have been led by the Crypto Valley Association, a nonprofit dedicated to the research and development of blockchain technologies, has also started to develop an ICO Code of Conduct in light of China\u2019s recent ban. This would establish a clear set of guidelines for companies planning token crowdsales and provide clear, yet versatile, rules surrounding their legality. Anchored by the city of Zug, which has been nicknamed \u201cCrypto Valley\u201d after the numerous blockchain startups based there, Switzerland has remained a friendly environment for burgeoning blockchain and digital currency companies.Estonia has also proven to be open to blockchain development; it recently expressed interest in creating a national cryptocurrency to be used within its borders. If this materialized, it would rank among the most significant milestones for cryptocurrency to date. In addition, members of Finland\u2019s central bank wrote a paper discussing the outstanding characteristics of Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by trading volume, its leading position among digital currencies does not behave like a traditional monopoly in economic terms. In fact, these economists argue that there\u2019s no need for governments to regulate Bitcoin due to its decentralized infrastructure. This is an interesting stance in comparison to other European nations that have expressed their support for the development of government policies surrounding digital currencies.In contrast, other countries may either feel that the blockchain space is still too underdeveloped to regulate in earnest or that an appropriate level of research has not been provided on the topic. Despite this, blockchain adoption will continue to become more mainstream than one might expect. Deloitte has reported more than 90 central banks are engaged in discussions about blockchain technology, and that 80 percent of those banks are expected to commence digital ledger projects by the end of the year. The International Monetary Fund has even expressed positive sentiment about the potential applications of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Their willingness to explore this technology means that regulations in the jurisdictions they serve are likely in the near future.The EEA\u2019s interest in considering blockchain regulation promises that the future will be bright for startups hoping to do business in these countries. However, gathering consensus around a technology that\u2019s still not widely used or applied will prove difficult. It will require these nations to adopt policies that feature the needed flexibility for the long term.

He covers topics in healthcare, technology, travel and culture. He holds bitcoin and ether.\nThe South Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) has announced it will ban all forms of initial coin offerings (ICOs). After a meeting to discuss virtual currency control, the vice-chairman of financial affairs, Kim Yong-bum, made this comment as part of an official statement:\u201cWe expressed a serious concern that the recent inflow of funds into the nonproductive speculative direction is showing up. As a result, we believe that additional measures are inevitable in order to switch to productive investment.\u201d The statement concludes by saying:\u201cAll forms of ICO prohibition including securities issuance [and] monetary lending and coin margins are prohibited, blocking all business related business alliances.\u201dKorean blockchain expert and entrepreneur Ash Han told Bitcoin Magazine that \u201cthe FSC is concerned about ignorant investors becoming victimized by scammers using crypto.\u201d Specifically, Han is referring to multi-level marketing or network marketing, an infamous way to raise money using existing distributors to recruit new distributors. This type of business strategy is often fraught with pyramid schemes in which raising money from new recruits buying in is the primary focus of the business instead of actual product development and sales.Because the FSC has judged that virtual currencies such as bitcoin and ether are electronic representations of value and not financial products such as securities, the government has chosen to indirectly regulate virtual currencies through banks.In addition to the FSC, several government organizations including the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC), the National Tax Service (Korean IRS) and the police have formed a joint inspection system that will examine the current conditions of virtual currency exchanges through on-site inspections. The FSC will examine the customer information leakages caused by hacking, strengthen penalties for similar behavior to prevent money laundering, and open a joint inspections system with several other government entities to examine the current conditions of digital currency traders and exchanges. The joint inspection system will also examine the regulatory and taxation trends of other countries and international organizations to form consensus on the character of virtual currency trade and taxation.Until December, virtual currencies such as bitcoin and ether will be traded on an exchange only if a bank has confirmed the authorization of an account. \u00a0\u201cWe will begin the transaction by checking the identity of the bank account and monitoring the flow of funds,\u201d stated an official from the Financial Services Commission. According to Han, employing banks to keep track of all new accounts opened on exchanges will permit the FSC\u2019s further investigation of violations regarding Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols. The only change for virtual currency exchange customers is that now these customers need to be able to prove that the bank accounts they have connected to an exchange belong to them. While these new regulations could be efforts to correct South Korea\u2019s frenzied ICO market, Han points out that if the South Korean authorities tightened control over virtual currencies much like China, they could \u201cput a huge tax on crypto-related activities.\u201dJay Kim, a.k.a The Crypto Lark, a Korean digital currency YouTube host, says the country\u2019s ICO ban will not affect individual investors who participate in foreign ICOs. \u201cIn Korea, people actively investing in ICOs will not be affected. The government is concerned with scams. I think it\u2019s a temporary measure until there are some regulations in place for ICOs.\u201d Scams and Bad ActorsThis news comes as no surprise given an overall global move to regulate ICOs in some way. China has banned the issuance of virtual currencies as illegal public funding. In July, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a warning that token sales would be regulated as securities and thus would have to comply with reporting and consumer protection requirements. On August 1, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) clarified that the issue of digital tokens would be regulated by MAS if the digital tokens constitute products regulated under the Securities and Futures Act. Also, the South Korean digital currency exchanges have been consistently targeted by hackers over the last several months. According to a report by security firm FireEye, North Korea has been targeting digital currency exchanges since April 2017. Since May 2017, North Korean actors have targeted at least three South Korean digital exchanges with the intent of stealing funds. This type of attack has been predominantly targeted at the \u201cpersonal email accounts of South Korean employees of digital exchanges using a tax-themed lure to deploy malware.\u201dOn July 5 2017 Bithumb was victim to a major hack. Bithumb remains South Korea\u2019s largest digital currency exchange, the world\u2019s second-largest Ethereum exchange by daily volume. At the time of the hack, 13.5 percent of the the total ether market was going through Bithumb\u2019s exchange. Attacks such as this one would certainly have attracted scrutiny from Korea\u2019s Internet and Security Agency.Growth and OpportunityThis latest blow to South Korea\u2019s cryptocurrency community comes at a time of recent growth and opportunity, despite the persistent scams and hacks of bad actors. Since China\u2019s ICO ban in early September, South Korea has quickly been overtaking China in daily trading volume of digital currencies. The country\u2019s connection to the internet and technology in general cannot be underestimated. According to a 2015 study by content delivery network Akamai, South Korea had the fastest internet speed in the world based on the unique IP count, and its largest export company, Samsung Electronics, made a profit of $16.5 billion USD in 2016.South Korea\u2019s third-largest exchange, Coinone, recently opened \u201cthe world\u2019s first blockchain 4D zone,\u201d a brick-and-mortar exchange complete with a bitcoin ATM, a large display with real-time market information and a face-to-face consultation service.The South Korean fintech firm Dunamu has announced the launch of a new crypto-trading platform through a partnership with the U.S.-based exchange Bittrex. The platform, called Upbit, will be released in beta in October. It will support over 110 different digital currencies including bitcoin, litecoin, ripple and ether.In terms of popularity, the digital currency community in Seoul alone is enormous with 16 registered cryptocurrency Meetups, the largest of which is the Seoul Ethereum Meetup with approximately 3,550 members. In the past year the government has even taken part in the digital currency industry by auctioning off confiscated bitcoin.", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 2}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIt\u2019s forking season.After Bitcoin Cash (Bcash) forked from the Bitcoin blockchain to create a new cryptocurrency (BCH), and ahead of the SegWit2X fork that may do the same thing, a third Bitcoin fork is in the making: Bitcoin Gold (Bgold; BTG). But where Bcash and SegWit2X are scaling-related forks \u2014 both mainly increase Bitcoin's block size limit \u2014 Bgold wants to re-decentralize mining by implementing a new proof-of-work algorithm.\u201cWhat was born as decentralized is now centralized,\u201d Bitcoin Gold contributor J. Alejandro Regojo told Bitcoin Magazine, referring to the current state of Bitcoin mining. \u201cWith this fork, we want to show how Bitcoin can be as \u2018Satoshi\u2019 as possible, as social as possible, and as decentralized as possible.\u201dMining CentralizationBitcoin Gold was initiated by Jack Liao, CEO of Hong Kong\u2013based mining hardware producer LightningASIC, and was first announced in late August. The open project has been gaining traction and support in the wider cryptocurrency space since, with a dedicated Slack as a main hub for discussion and organization. Bgold is currently being developed by the pseudonymous developer \u201ch4x3rotab\u201d along with a small group of volunteers contributing to the project in other ways.The attention Bgold has attracted is probably in part because anyone who owns bitcoin (BTC) on October 25th will receive the equivalent amount of BTG. While this model has been criticized, particularly because it presents a burden on service providers and users, it has also proven successful. With the launch of Bitcoin Cash in particular, users eagerly accepted their batch of \u201cfree money,\u201d while exchanges, wallets and other service providers proved relatively willing to integrate the new coin. Further, the Bgold team believes that this distribution method should also benefit Bitcoin over altcoins as it provides an extra incentive to hold BTC on particular dates.\u201cBut the key goal that we are trying to achieve with this fork is to build a perpetually ASIC-resistant version of Bitcoin,\u201d said Robert Kuhne, another Bitcoin Gold contributor, in explaining the purpose of the project to Bitcoin Magazine.Bgold contributors like Regojo and Kuhne think that Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work hashing algorithm was essentially broken by the introduction of specialized ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) mining hardware. In the early years of Bitcoin\u2019s existence, individual users were often also miners; this has since become concentrated into relatively centralized data centers operated by professionals.\u201cAnd we\u2019re now in a situation where 65 percent of hash power comes from a country that doesn\u2019t like Bitcoin,\u201d Regojo noted, referring to China\u2019s recent clamp down on cryptocurrencies.An Uneven Playing FieldAnd while mining is centralized, ASIC production is even more centralized, the Bgold contributors pointed out. Only a handful of companies currently produce such specialized chips. This means that anyone who wants to be a miner in any meaningful way is beholden to these companies, Kuhne argued.\u201cThe way the monopoly manufacturer currently operates is abusive to its customers \u2014 individual miners \u2014 and the industry at large,\u201d he said, referring to major Chinese ASIC producer Bitmain. \u201cManufacturers can produce ASICs at a tiny cost, but miners have to buy at a high price. This violates the one-CPU-one-vote ethos as described in the Bitcoin white paper, because while everyone can buy CPU at the same price, the same is not true for ASIC hardware.\u201dRegojo and Kuhne see this as a fundamental problem \u2014 not something that free market dynamics can realistically resolve. They suggest that the barrier of entry to the ASIC market to compete with existing manufacturers is fundamentally too high to allow for open competition.\u201cYou can't build a factory without approval from the government and banking system. So there are really only a handful of entities in the world that have total authority over who can and can't manufacture ASIC machines. And all this could potentially get much worse if and when those institution really start feeling the disruption from Bitcoin, which hasn't begun in earnest yet,\u201d Kuhne said.Bitcoin GoldAs opposed to the Bitcoin Cash and (especially) the upcoming SegWit2X forks, Bitcoin Gold very specifically does not make a claim to be the \u201creal\u201d Bitcoin. Instead, the Bgold project hopes it can prove a valuable exercise for Bitcoin; a sort of test case for a hard fork that Bitcoin itself may one day require.Concretely, Bitcoin Gold is now implementing the Equihash proof-of-work algorithm. This is already used by Zcash and is relatively ASIC-resistant. Full ASIC-resistance, however, is thought to be impossible: Any mining algorithm could be subject to specialized chips. Like Vertcoin, the Bgold community therefore plans to re-deploy a new proof-of-work algorithm hard fork if it is found out that ASIC-chips for Equihash are being produced. (This plan alone, of course, could be a deterrent for any potential ASIC-producer.)For security, the project plans to implement strong replay protection to avoid loss of funds for unsuspecting or non-technical users. It will also adopt a new difficulty re-target algorithm to prevent the blockchain from stalling: Difficulty is re-adjusted at every block instead of once every two weeks.While the coin is set to launch two weeks from now, the Bgold codebase is not yet fully developed and ready to be deployed. Implementation of the new proof-of-work algorithm and replay protection, as well as the new difficulty re-adjustment scheme, are yet to be finished.Nor are all the details for the project even ironed out.Early announcements indicated that Bitcoin Gold would have a closed launch and a presale of coins. A new batch of BTG was to be mined in the first week after the fork and subsequently distributed to designated investors, not unlike an ICO. Proceeds of this \u201cICO\u201d were then to be used for development and other Bgold-related purposes.However, as interest in the project grew, this idea became more controversial. Not everyone involved with Bitcoin Gold likes the idea of an additional founders reward \u2014 something Bcash, for example, did not have.Kuhne addressed the issue by stating: \u201cWe have heard a lot of feedback from the community, so this proposal will be replaced with an updated and improved plan. But we will not completely rule out the possibility of a modest pre-mine to provide a basic level of funding for the project.\u201dDisclaimer: The author of this article holds BTC and will therefore also own BTG at launch.", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 11}
{"title": "Op Ed: Is There a Future for Banking in a Cryptocurrency-Dominated World?", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-there-future-banking-cryptocurrency-dominated-world/", "birthday": "Oct 11, 2017 9:39 AM EST", "date": "2017-10-11 14:39:00", "content": "What is the future of banking, central banking and financial intermediation in a world in which cryptocurrency is dominant? Let\u2019s speculate a bit, with the proviso that no one can fully anticipate how these markets will evolve.We can find hints in the speech by IMF head Christine Lagarde at a Bank of England conference in September 2017. She dropped some words that likely sent some chills down a few spines in the audience. She explained that cryptocurrency is not a passing fad but a genuine innovation in money. The only remaining barriers to widespread adoption are technical, fixable and likely to be overcome as the sector develops. This, she argued, has profound implications for the future of financial intermediation and central banks. \u201cIn the future,\u201d she explained, \u201cwe might keep minimal balances for payment services on electronic wallets. The remaining balances may be kept in mutual funds, or invested in peer-to-peer lending platforms with an edge in big data and artificial intelligence for automatic credit scoring \u2026 Some would argue that this puts a question mark on the fractional banking model we know today, if there are fewer bank deposits and money flows into the economy through new channels.\u201dShe continued to press the point, as it relates directly to the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. \u201cHow would monetary policy be set in this context? Today\u2019s central banks typically affect asset prices through primary dealers, or big banks, to which they provide liquidity at fixed prices \u2014 so-called open-market operations. But if these banks were to become less relevant in the new financial world, and demand for central bank balances were to diminish, could monetary policy transmission remain as effective?\u201dShe put a question mark after that last sentence, but she might as well have made the statement: Monetary policy cannot be effective in this world. In fact, it is worse. It might not matter at all. It\u2019s an astonishing thing to consider. For more than a century, academics, regulators, captains of finance and high-level government officials have worked to find the perfect monetary policy to stabilize the macroeconomy, provide liquidity for growth without inflation and otherwise become masters of economic planning. But this entire machinery is premised on two important conditions. First, the government must have the monopoly on money. It has held this for more than a century. Government prints the money, controls its supply, imposes legal tender and regulates against the enforcement of contracts denominated in unofficial currency. And second, most of this money has to be held in some way in the banking system. If you take away both of those, the cause of central banking has a serious problem pursuing any form of monetary planning at all. That is indeed a very different world. And it is no wonder that the ruling class is concerned. Today, banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are experimenting with blockchain technology and cryptoassets. And Lagarde\u2019s own statement might be seen to portend the issuance of a new global cryptocurrency to replace the Special Drawing Right. The core problem of these large-scale attempts to reproduce the power of the distributed ledger is that it might be too little, too late. The model of a new world of banking and credit is already revealing itself. Would Banks Exist? How is conventional banking affected by cryptocurrency? Lagarde offers that it raises questions about fractional-reserve banking, the practice of keeping fewer deposits on hand than can be immediately paid out to customers at any one time. The practice has been well established for hundreds of years, and yet it can lead to unwarranted expansions of credit and fuel system-wide instability. Consider the history of banking. What was the purpose of the bank? There have been traditionally three primary functions that banks have provided since the ancient world. The first has been to provide safe storage for money itself. This is the warehousing function. It is essential and worth paying for. People need a safe place to store their money. The second is the loan function. The more credible the warehousing function becomes, the more the bank is in the position to leverage its specie holdings for its credit-granting functions. This is the origin of fractional-reserve banking. The bank cannot pay all depositors on demand. Instead, it relies on its financial soundness and a rate of return for depositors who entrust the bank with the responsibility of maintaining its balance sheet. The third is the clearing system. Because there is always counterparty risk in such transactions \u2014 the bank and the depositor must trust each other to tell the truth and make good on promises \u2014 the system settles transactions and certifies that all promises to pay have been kept. In the period between the transaction and the clearing, money becomes a credit issued and accepted based on trust. What happens to these three functions in a crypto-based monetary economy? Let\u2019s go through them. WarehousingThat money needed a warehouse has always been taken for granted. This was a technological limitation of salt, gold, silver and so on. Specie takes up space. You need a secure space for it. It is also weighty and impractical for moving from space to space by a single individual. Murray Rothbard, in his book \u201cMystery of Banking,\u201d regrets that these factors even exist and pointedly says that if people had carried coins rather than relying on paper money from banks, we could have avoided a century of financial panic and inflation. That\u2019s a theoretically sound point that runs into practical limitations. The reason for notes to represent specie is to facilitate trade in a way that meets the needs of consumers. However, thanks to Bitcoin, we can now see that this warehousing service was in demand due to physical factors and not fundamental ones. Bitcoin has all the attributes of traditional money but adds two advantages: it is weightless and takes up no physical space. The money is \u201cstored\u201d in the cloud on the blockchain. The personal wallet serves the function of providing access via double-key cryptography. If you have your private key \u2014 and this can be on physical paper or on a device not even connected to the internet \u2014 you have all you need to set up your own private banking empire. Anyone in the world can do it without trust relationships, personal identification or credit history. The institutions that seem like banks \u2014 services like Coinbase that hold your key for you \u2014 maintain a full-reserve policy or risk losing the trust of their customers. It is impossible to anticipate what kinds of crypto-derivatives will end up being securitized and traded in the future. Surely, the last nine years of the previously impossible should cause everyone to be humble in their predictive outlook. That said, there is good reason to believe that the diminution of counterparty risk inherent in every non-cash transaction will drive markets toward greater accountability in every sense. And this alone might solve the age-old debate about fractional versus full reserves with the best possible resolution. The question does not have to be resolved by intellectuals and policies. It is settled by the market, so long as technology permits people to pay for goods and services with a spaceless and weightless money that requires no warehousing. Clearing As for clearing, the single most difficult-to-grasp feature of Bitcoin is the manner in which it reduces or eliminates counterparty risk associated with monetary exchange. Transactions are cleared as they are made. This has never before been possible in the history of money and finance on a geographically noncontiguous basis. With traditional money, for clearing to occur instantly, you have to actually be there, trading physical dollars for goods and services. Cryptocurrency reproduces this exact financial arrangement on a peer-to-peer basis between any two individuals anywhere in the world. You are literally trading your stuff for his or her stuff. Ownership titles are rearranged when the transaction is confirmed in the ledger. What role is then here for traditional banks to be the guardians of settlement? When it comes to clearing services, so far as I can tell, that role is eliminated for all transactions that are settled in the instant of their confirmation (the time delay involved in moving crypto is nothing more than a delay; it creates no credits). What About Credit?We are habituated into thinking that the whole world runs on credit. That\u2019s because it does. This isn\u2019t because we are financially irresponsible, are unable to say no, absolutely adore large financial institutions or are willing to pay high rates of interest. It\u2019s because the sophistication of modern financial technology has been hobbled by old-fashioned payment technology that still operates today the way it did in the time of the Medicis. In any case, the fundamentals are the same in conventional finance today as compared with the Medicis. It still relies on trust relationships, credit instruments that represent property but do not embody it, and a time delay for transactions to clear. As a result, every transaction that is not conducted in person via cash depends on some extension of credit and thus involves intermediating third parties, and that in turn necessarily involves some counterparty risk. It is fascinating how little we understand this today, but the truth becomes obvious on close examination: Every transaction today is either based on cash (instant title exchange and clearing) or credit (which involves trust relationships and counterparty risk). Services like Venmo, Google Payments, PayPal or dozens of others are no different in this respect from Visa, Mastercard or American Express. They can be more or less expensive, charge different user fees, and employ different interfaces and security protocols. But in the end, these services all rely on credit terms and do not offer instant clearing. They simply cannot because the decrepit technology of national monies does not allow it. Cryptocurrency as a means of facilitating exchange is different in another respect. Its value is not tied to a nationalized currency at all. Not only that, it has no value as a commodity or asset at all. Its value is based on the use value of services provided by the cloud-based distributed ledger. The massive use of credit-based exchanges as we see in national monies would not exist in Bitcoin precisely because the technology disintermediates the financial industry, removing both the need for trust relationships as well as clearing services. Might there emerge a market for crypto-substitute monetary derivatives? Only the evolution of these markets can reveal this for sure, but this much remains true. It will not be about creating new money being allowed by the protocol. The distinction between money and money substitutes will be clear and not obscured by retrograde documentation technology. At the same time, the scaling problem of prevailing blockchain solutions will likely necessitate a convention of using off-chain platforms for smaller transactions, as Nick Szabo has suggested. Such transactions do involve counterparty risk but not credit creation as such; such networks operate more like debit cards. The main blockchains will likely be used for final settlements while \u201clightning networks\u201d become trust-based credit tools (money substitutes) \u2014 by choice but not by necessity. Additionally, the massive industry associated with credit-based transactions includes a vast machinery of fraud prevention and prevention of identity theft. This is also made unnecessary because identity is cryptographic and not personal. Credit MarketsAll this said, there is still a role for credit markets in cryptocurrency. They emerge precisely as they would in a purely specie-based monetary regime in which everyone carried around their own coins or stored them in the home. If you have excess monetary reserves in your own possession, you may be willing to loan them for others to use and do so at a profit. In order to reduce the risk of default and guarantee your investment, you need collateral; this can take any form. You also need to establish a trust relationship, same as with any other loan market. \u00a0The difference is subtle but foundational. When you loan virtual money, you lose title to that money, just as if you had transferred physical property. Contractual terms would specify the ways in which a later exchange would occur in accordance with the terms of use. Again, the way to think about this is how it works in a cash economy: You loan a friend $20 and hand him cash. You cannot get it back by force. As the lender you rely on establishing a contractual relationship that creates expectations for future payment, along with some measure of risk. These markets have already developed. Companies like Bitbond and BTCPOP offer services both for lending money and borrowing money, with the terms of exchange favoring both parties. For now, such standalone services are risky simply because the upstart sector is replete with sketchy schemes and fraud (\u201cLend your BTC to me and I will pay you back, I promise.\u201d). Much more promising is a simple margin lender service provided by dollar/Bitcoin exchanges themselves. The borrower does not take direct possession of the coins but is rather extended by the exchange at the behest of the customer who wants to earn a regular rate of return. An example is the lending service provided by Poloniex. The trouble these markets have so far encountered is that holding crypto is more profitable than lending it at prevailing rates. This might not always be true. As these markets develop, it would not be a surprise to discover that the rate of return for the lender would be above the rate one would earn from nationalized money. The risk of default would not be guaranteed in any way as with government-backed financial institutions, much less a central bank that is capable of printing unlimited amounts of money. On the other hand, this would also eliminate the moral hazard of making unwise loans or securitizing debt obligations without proper documentation, such as happened during the housing bubble. In the century of central banking, we\u2019ve seen interest rates decline inexorably and the terms of credit issuance shifting dramatically to favor longer terms, ever less collateral and ever more confusing titles for ownership. In cryptocurrency-based credit markets, we are likely to see the opposite trend: shorter terms, higher collateral requirements, very clear titles demarcating indisputable rights of ownership and enforcement of terms built into lending protocols. The Future of Sound MoneyChristine Lagarde is right: There are dramatic challenges to the status quo that are being offered up by the advent of cryptocurrency. Monetary exchange will operate the same as cash exchange, and the sophistication of our payment and settlement technologies will sync up with the sophistication of our financial tools. In some respects, cryptocurrency might appear to be more stingy than our current highly leveraged, unstable and centrally regulated systems. In contrast, the new world will be financially sound, stable, radically disintermediated, decentralized and democratized because anyone, of any financial means and access to financial institutions, can participate within it. We\u2019ve only begun to think about what a radical change it would be if our money actually gained value over time (as crypto has for nine years, and the dollar did in the late 19th century), so that you actually grow more wealthy merely by not spending. Such a change would be huge, not only for finance but also for the culture at large. For more than a century, the banking system has been used to fund the state, destabilize the economy, loot private savings, exclude people who don\u2019t have access, promote financial dependency and even make violence possible on an unprecedented scale, all because we didn\u2019t have a different technology for making possible monetary exchange. That monopoly is now being shattered. Sound money is born.

Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national who was one of the operators of BTC-e, was arrested abroad and indicted for conspiracy and money laundering in connection with facilitating more than $4 billion in ransomware payouts and other related financial crimes focused on individuals who engage in activities ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking.The prosecution of BTC-e by FinCEN and Vinnik by the USAO should be no surprise. BTC-e was an alleged hub of criminal activity. Businesses operating in the digital currency space may look at these prosecutions and find them insignificant because the alleged conduct is not conduct in which they are engaged, and they are good corporate citizens who do not facilitate criminal activity. But these prosecutions remind us that the advent of Bitcoin and other digital currencies (sometimes referred to as virtual currencies, cryptocurrencies, altcoins or tokens) raises a serious issue: When do businesses in the digital currency space become \u201cfinancial institutions\u201d that must collect and retain information about their customers and share that information with FinCEN in accordance with the federal Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d)? Real lessons can be learned from re-examining FinCEN\u2019s 2013 guidance, entitled \u201cApplication of FinCEN\u2019s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies,\u201d and revisiting the prosecution of Ripple Labs, Inc., (\u201cRipple\u201d) by FinCEN in coordination with the USAO, which Ripple settled in 2015. FinCEN\u2019s action against Ripple was the first civil enforcement action against a virtual currency exchange for failing to implement an effective AML program and failing to report suspicious activity related to certain financial transactions. FinCEN\u2019s recent action against BTC-e was the first time FinCEN prosecuted a foreign entity operating as a \u201cmoney services business\u201d as defined under the BSA. FinCEN asserted jurisdiction over BTC-e because BTC-e processed nearly $300 million in transactions involving U.S. customers. Compliance with the BSA is a particularly sensitive topic in the digital currency industry because digital currency transactions are recorded on a blockchain, a distributed electronic ledger, which contains no personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d), and thus digital identities are concealed. The BSA mandates record-keeping and reporting requirements for certain transactions, including the identity of an individual engaged in the transaction, by financial institutions through the use of Currency Transaction Reports (\u201cCTRs\u201d), Suspicious Activity Reports (\u201cSARs\u201d), Currency or Monetary Instrument Reports (\u201cCMIRs\u201d) and Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts Reports (\u201cFBARs\u201d). After the September 11, 2001, attacks, the Patriot Act amended the BSA by adding know-your-customer (\u201cKYC\u201d) reporting requirements that include enhanced due-diligence policies, procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering or terrorist financing. The BSA applies to \u201cfinancial institutions\u201d (as defined in the statute), and most digital currency businesses fall into the \u201cmoney transmitter\u201d (\u201cMT\u201d) or \u201cmoney services business\u201d (\u201cMSB\u201d) categories of financial institutions regulated under the BSA. In 2013, FinCEN issued guidance and statements that it would enforce AML requirements against MTs and MSBs operating in the digital currency space, particularly with respect to exchanges on which virtual currencies trade, and on systems providing services for such exchanges. Individual investors need not fear \u2014 an individual (or company) can invest in digital currency and sell those currencies for profit without complying with the BSA. However, a company that helps others buy, sell or send digital currency by \u201caccepting and transmitting\u201d digital currency must comply with the BSA. \u201cAccepting and transmitting\u201d means that a company receives digital currency from one customer and sends it on their behalf to another person. Merely giving digital currency to someone or accepting digital currency from someone \u2014 for example, as a method of payment \u2014 does not mean you are a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d under the BSA. In addition, those who develop and distribute software to facilitate the sale of digital currency do not need to comply with the BSA. But, an exchanger who \u201cbuys and sells [digital currency] ... for any reason,\u201d such as providing a brokerage or exchange service for customers, is subject to the BSA. In addition, given the wave of recent initial coin offerings (\u201cICOs\u201d) in which digital currencies used for various purposes are offered to the public for sale, it is important to note that a digital currency need not be used like fiat currency in order to be subject to the BSA \u2014 it simply needs to be used as \u201cvalue\u201d that \u201csubstitutes for currency.\u201d There is conflicting guidance on whether the offerers of digital currency who sell their own tokens to U.S. citizens are subject to the BSA. However, FinCEN has advised that a company selling digital currency from its own account is not subject to BSA reporting requirements. Notwithstanding that guidance, in FinCEN\u2019s 2015 settlement with Ripple, it alleged that Ripple\u2019s mere sale of XRP, its own digital currency, rendered Ripple an MSB that violated the BSA by failing to register with FinCEN, and by failing to implement and maintain an adequate AML program. Of course, Ripple is a currency exchange that would ordinarily be subject to the BSA, but the fact that FinCEN\u2019s settlement with Ripple specifically alleges that Ripple\u2019s sale of XRP violated the BSA raises issues of risk and uncertainty from a legal standpoint for digital currency offerers with respect to compliance with the BSA. In conclusion, companies that operate or are considering operating in the digital currency space should conduct a thorough analysis of anti-money laundering regulations to understand potential registration requirements with FinCEN and whether they are required to implement AML policies and procedures to comply with the BSA.\nMichelle Gitlitz\u00a0is a partner at Blank Rome and is part of its Blockchain Working Group.

There are no clear signs of bearish divergence yet and the market is starting to pick up in volume as the price climbs, thus indicating that a healthy bullish continuation is likely. Looking at the 50 and 200 EMAs, we can see the slope is pointing upward and the market is trending well above both EMAs, showing us that the market is pushing upward in a sustainable manner. On a micro level, there are slight signs of bullish exhaustion that may indicate the need to either consolidate sideways or pull back slightly before continuing upward:Figure 2: BTC-USD, 30-Minute Candles, GDAX, Micro TrendThe MACD and RSI are showing clear signs of bearish divergence on the smaller timescales (shown via the red arrows on the indicators). Also, the current growth is decreasing in volume which usually indicates a lack of buyer interest at the current price levels as the trend continues upward. It\u2019s important to note that the trend can remain healthy on a macro scale, while simultaneously remaining divergent on a smaller timescale. The divergence doesn\u2019t imply a macro reversal \u2014 it simply means the current trend is lacking momentum to continue upward in the immediate future and likely needs to cool off before continuing any further.On the higher timescales, bitcoin appears to be adhering to the ascending channel shown below:Figure 3: BTC-USD, 1 Day Candles, GDAX, Ascending ChannelSince the beginning of the year, bitcoin has adhered to very nicely to this channel where it routinely tests the top, then tests the bottom, then tests the top, and so on and so forth. If we continue this pattern we can expect to see bitcoin test the $6000s before we see any major correction. However, it is important to note that, compared to Bitcoin\u2019s last bull run to the $5000s, the volume is considerably lower. This may affect bitcoin\u2019s ability to push toward the upper bounds of the channel. On the other hand, the indicators discussed in Figure 1 are showing healthy bullish signals, so we will have to see how the market responds to tests of new highs.Summary:Bitcoin found new all time highs in the $5300s after having a sudden $500 rally.The macro momentum indicators are showing signs of bullish continuation which may push further new all time highs.The smaller time frames are showing signs of bullish exhaustion so we may see some consolidation before any bullish continuation is seen.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThis is an updated version of A Bitcoin Beginner's Guide to Surviving a Coin-Split specifically addressing issues associated with the upcoming Bitcoin Gold and SegWit2x forks.It looks as if Bitcoin will experience at least two more \u201ccoin-splits\u201d soon, which (more accurately) will result in the creation of new coins. On October 25, Bitcoin Gold (Bgold) will split off from Bitcoin to create an ASIC-resistant cryptocurrency. A few weeks later, a significant group of Bitcoin companies wants to hard fork according to the SegWit2x plan as defined in the \u201cNew York Agreement\u201d (NYA), which will probably result in yet another new coin.\u00a0Update: Many of these companies and the main organizers behind SegWit2x have by now decided not to move forward with their hard fork. Others may still proceed, however, so if you want to be on the safe side, the advice in this article does still hold up.If this all plays out, there could be three distinct blockchains and three types of coins within about a month of publication of this article. One blockchain would follow the current Bitcoin protocol; for the purpose of this article, that coin will be referred to as \u201cBTC.\u201d The second blockchain will follow the Bgold protocol; in this article, that coin will be referred to as \u201cBTG.\u201d The third blockchain will follow the SegWit2x protocol; that coin will be referred to as \u201cB2X.\u201dThe good news is that each BTC will effectively be copied onto both the Bgold and the SegWit2x blockchains. If you hold Bitcoin private keys at the time of the forks, you should be able to access your BTG and B2X coins as well.The bad news is that such forks can be somewhat messy and risky. If you\u2019re not careful, it\u2019s easy to lose your BTC or B2X, and maybe your BTG.This guide will provide you with the basics to keep your funds safe during the upcoming forks and help to ensure you make it to the end of next month with your BTC, BTG and B2X intact.Author\u2019s note: If you want to play the markets as soon as possible and you are fine with taking risks, and/or you really know what you are doing, this article is probably not for you: it's a beginner's guide. Also please note that everything in this article is just advise, based on our best understanding of the situation. Much is still uncertain and subject to change.Before the Forks (That\u2019s Now)First of all, be aware that coin-splits can be somewhat risky \u2014 especially controversial ones like the SegWit2x fork. While it seems unlikely for now, there is a chance some kind of cyber-battle will break out, perhaps even escalating to the point where all exchange rates drop sharply. If you want to make sure not to be caught in any crossfire, it\u2019s best to not hold more value in bitcoin than you are willing to lose.If you do decide to hold on to your bitcoin, make sure you are prepared before October 25, and preferably sooner. This is the day the BTG equivalent will be distributed to all BTC balances. B2X will follow a couple of weeks later, around mid-November (the exact date is not yet known).If you are storing your bitcoins on an exchange, in a custodial service like Coinbase, Circle or Xapo, or on any other service that holds your private keys for you, you may or may not eventually receive BTC, BTG and B2X. This is not yet very clear, and if you want to keep storing your coins on such services, you should at least see if your exchange or custodial service of choice has made an official statement on the forks, perhaps on their company blog. If not, contact them to ask.That said, if you want to be absolutely sure to be able to access your BTC, BTG and B2X, you should really control your private keys yourself. That way you don\u2019t need to rely on any third party.If you\u2019re currently using a custodial service to store your bitcoins, you need to create your own wallet instead. Send or withdraw your bitcoins from the custodial service to this new wallet; this wallet then holds your private keys.What kind of wallet you want to use is up to you. For this specific purpose it\u2019s best to use a wallet that lets you easily access your private keys directly. (Some wallets make this easier for you than others.) But technically, any wallet that lets you control your private keys should be fine.With that in mind, here are some basic solutions:If you don\u2019t care about transacting with BTC, BTG or B2X anytime soon, and really just want to keep all of them as long-term investments, a paper wallet is a good option. It should be noted, however, that this option is only really secure if you follow strict security precautions, which you can find here.Regular wallets are about as secure as your computer (or phone). Since most computers and phones are not all that secure, these are not ideal for large amounts. With that in mind, all mobile and desktop wallets listed on bitcoin.org will store your private keys. Electrum is a good pick if you want easy access to your private keys directly.A full-node wallet like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots is also a good pick, as it\u2019s not too hard to access your private keys with these wallets either. As a bonus, these wallets give you a little extra security on the Bitcoin blockchain (shortly) after the SegWit2X fork, because these wallets enforce all of Bitcoin's current protocol rules. However, these types of wallets are more resource-intensive to use, compared to most other wallets.Another option is to get a hardware wallet. Any of the hardware wallets listed on bitcoin.org will keep your private keys secure. However, these wallets typically don\u2019t let you easily access your private keys directly. It\u2019s not clear that all these wallets will let you access BTG in particular, and not all of them have given a guarantee for B2X either. So while these wallets will safely store your private keys, it could be a bit more tricky (but probably not impossible) to get ahold of all three coins later.In any case: Be sure to make backups of your keys! Most wallets require you to do this when installing; don\u2019t skip this step.Shortly After the Bitcoin Gold Fork (and Before the SegWit2x Fork)The Bitcoin Gold fork is sometimes referred to as a \u201cfriendly fork.\u201d This is mainly because it has no intention of claiming to be the \u201creal\u201d Bitcoin, and it plans to implement strong replay protection.In short, this replay protection means that you won\u2019t accidentally send your BTG when you mean to send BTC (or the other way around). So even after you\u2019ve spent your BTC, you can still access your BTG.If you want to transact with your BTC before the SegWit2x fork, it could come in handy later to write down which of your Bitcoin addresses and/or private keys had BTG attributed to them \u2014 in other words, which of your Bitcoin addresses had any BTC on them at the time of the Bgold fork on October 25th.But there\u2019s no rush to actually access your BTG. In fact, it will probably take at least a week before this is even possible, and maybe longer. It\u2019s therefore probably best to ignore this fork until after the SegWit2x fork. That way you\u2019ll only need to go through the process of claiming all your new coins once.After the SegWit2x ForkUnfortunately, the SegWit2x fork could play out a bit more messily.For one, several of the companies backing SegWit2x consider this fork an upgrade of Bitcoin itself. They therefore currently have no intention to adopt a new name for it. Some of them will call or list (what this article refers to as) SegWit2x and B2X, as \"Bitcoin\" and \"BTC\". Meanwhile, they might call or list (what this article refers to as) BTC as \"B1X\", or another ticker.And of course, all coins will command their own exchange rates. So as different exchanges list a different coin as \"BTC\", the price for \"BTC\" could differ vastly across exchanges: they're actually different coins! You should therefore not buy or sell any coin listed as \"BTC\", unless and until you are very sure which coin your exchange lists as \"BTC\".Additionally, it currently seems SegWit2x will fork without strong replay protection. This means that post-fork, BTC transactions and B2X transactions will look identical and could both be valid on both blockchains.Therefore, spending coins on the BTC blockchain could make you accidentally spend the \u201cequivalent\u201d B2X on the SegWit2x blockchain, and the other way around. Instead of paying someone only BTC, you may unintentionally send B2X as well \u2014 or vice versa. The BTCs and B2Xs are initially \u201cstuck together.\u201dTo be on the safe side, you should probably not spend an coins after the SegWit2x fork at all. As explained below, you'll first need to \"split\" your coins.Furthermore, some light wallets (mobile wallets) will display whichever blockchain has more hash power attributed to it. This means that the balance on your screen could be a BTC balance or a B2X balance, and there will be no way to tell the difference. (Even if the wallet says it\u2019s a BTC balance!)To be on the safe side, you should not accept any payments with light wallets, since you could receive B2X when you\u2019re expecting BTC, or the other way around. At the very least, you should make absolutely sure that your wallet displays what you think it displays. (Wallets like Electrum and GreenAddress should display BTC as \"BTC\" regardless of hashpower distribution.) If you use a full-node wallet like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots and you want to accept BTC, that should also be fine.Depending on how much hash power is dedicated to each chain, it is possible that transactions will confirm (significantly) slower than usual for some time and will require higher fees to confirm at all.Claiming Your CoinsIf all three chains survive, and you control your private keys, you should be able to access BTC, BTG and B2X around mid-November.Claiming your BTG should be relatively easy, assuming there are wallets available for it. Most likely, you\u2019d simply need to insert your private keys (or private key seed) into such a wallet.However, there are some security and privacy risks in doing so. It\u2019s too soon to tell exactly what these risks will look like as it\u2019s unclear which wallets will support BTG. (It\u2019s not even certain that any wallets will.) But in general, you\u2019ll first want to move your BTC (and B2X) to new addresses or whole new wallets before accessing your BTG.Since there\u2019s no need to rush, it\u2019s probably best just to wait on claiming your BTG until there is more clarity. By that time, Bitcoin Magazine will publish a follow-up article explaining how to do this.Securely accessing and using your B2X (and BTC) might prove a bit more tricky, mostly because of the risk of replay attacks. This requires that the BTC and B2X are split from each other, which will be possible but could prove a bit complex.Some wallets might split the coins for you, but it's too soon to know which wallets will. Additionally, exchanges will likely set up coin-splitting services and take care of most of this complexity behind the screens. You\u2019d then just need to send your BTC or B2X to an exchange, and the exchange will credit your account with both BTC and B2X. (They should even replay the transaction for you to make sure they indeed receive both your coins and can split them for you.)\u00a0There may also be other solutions to split your coins, but that remains to be seen.By mid-November, there will probably also be dedicated wallets for both BTC and B2X. Of course, you may need to upgrade your existing wallet or download a new wallet. This also remains to be seen.Further specifics on what to do after the forks will be announced on Bitcoin Magazine once the forks have occurred and we have a better understanding of the post-fork situation.So, to Recap ...1. It\u2019s best to control your private keys yourself before October 25, and hold on to them until after the SegWit2x fork, mid-November.2. To be on the safe side, avoid buying or selling any \"BTC\" and don't make any transactions shortly after the SegWit2x fork.3. As the dust settles after the SegWit2x fork, access and split your coins. (How to do this will be explained on Bitcoin Magazine once there is more clarity.)This article was last updated on November 12th.\u00a0This article will be updated as the news develops.", "year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 13}
{"title": "Joint Report by Stellar and Luxembourg Fintech Platform: Approach ICOs with Caution", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/joint-report-stellar-and-luxembourg-fintech-platform-approach-icos-caution/", "birthday": "Sep 20, 2017  2:28 PM EST", "date": "2017-09-20 19:28:00", "content": "Benjamin Vit\u00e1ris is a Bitcoin enthusiast who currently studies marketing at the Budapest Business School. He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\n\u00a0Stellar, a nonprofit decentralized financial network,\u00a0and the Luxembourg House of Financial Technology (LHoFT), the country\u2019s dedicated fintech platform, have published a joint report on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).\nAccording to the report, organizations have raised over $1.8 billion through ICOs since January 2017. As this popular new fundraising method provides a simple and fast method to acquire serious funding, there has been \u201ctremendous momentum\u201d growing around ICO launches among new businesses in the blockchain industry, the report said.On the other hand, the report also detailed that there are high risks associated with ICO investments. Since there is still a lack of regulation and control surrounding the industry, Stellar and LHoFT compared the current ICO sphere to the \u201cWild West\u201d \u2014 a term that has become rather popular of late in reference to ICOs.\u201cICOs raise issues for consumer protection, combating money laundering, and other regulatory compliance goals. Complications may arise from several sources, including the mechanism through which ICOs are conducted, the teams spearheading ICOs, the identities of contributors to ICOs, the quantity of money that is raised, the validity of ICOs\u2019 technology and processes, marketing claims, and the impact that ICOs have on the greater cryptocurrency markets. All these factors must be scrutinized so that the heralded benefits of ICOs are balanced against market and legal risks as the model matures and gains broader acceptance,\u201d the report states.LHoFT and Stellar addressed both the upsides and the downsides of ICO fundraising. Organizations launching ICOs benefit from a built-in customer base, a committed group of customers that will stay with the product or service until it officially launches. Furthermore, according to the report, the fundraising method has positive effects on the network, can target global investors (or donors) in a non-discriminatory manner while providing a fast and easy fundraising mechanism. Additionally, retail investors are keen on participating in ICOs, and open-source projects can benefit from the fundraising method too.Similarly, investors can benefit from the high liquidity of the tokens (sold during ICOs), in addition to being able to sell them through cryptocurrency exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, which would allow the investors to transfer the tokens easily without the authorization of the token issuer (the organization launching the ICO).\nToken holders are often offered bonuses, such as \u201cgift cards\u201d or \u201clicenses\u201d that will incentivize them to support the growth and the development of the project. ICO investors also benefit from the lack of \u201cgeo-lock\u201d \u2014 they can invest in the project no matter the location (unless specified otherwise). Most importantly, ICOs have a high potential for big gains.On the other hand, there are plenty of risks associated with ICOs, according to the report. Firstly, ICOs lack the formal process for auditing the organizations.The writers of the study highlighted a potential problem with smart contracts: If the contract is not programmed correctly, it could lead to unexpected transfers without the authorization of the token owner. Some tokens are not based on any fundamental value, thus, may facilitate bubbles and Ponzi schemes.\nFurthermore, Stellar and LHoFT emphasized the issue of \u201cinvestor education\u201d \u2014 some investors are not informed well enough about an ICO project before investing in it. The report also detailed security problems, such as phishing scams and the loss of private keys, which can result in the investors losing their tokens.As with most cryptocurrencies, tokens also tend to be volatile. According to the report, ICO cashouts may create price distortions on the market. Furthermore, the market can be subjected to manipulation, such as the \u201cWhales\u201d method, in which the token issuer organization holds back a percentage of the tokens and distributes them between the team members. Both investors and organizations can experience network lag during popular ICOs, while some token distribution mechanisms can cause unpredicted difficulties for both parties.The lack of regulations within the ICO space presents various problems for both the investors and the organizations, such as being subject to the financial regulations of multiple jurisdictions. The anonymous nature of the cryptocurrency sphere can result in many of the investors being seen only as pseudonyms, which could cause issues for law enforcement and regulators. Since there is uncertainty about the taxation of tokens, both investors and organizations could face legal issues, such as tax evasion charges. Furthermore, the report discusses that there is an increasing concern that ICOs can be used by criminals for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 20}

But for content creators of all kinds, blockchain technology provides an ideal solution to preserve intellectual property, create demand and increase value for digital content.\nThe digital revolution is often blamed for making life harder than ever for artists. We are always hearing stories of artists realizing their work has been ripped off by a major brand or that they are not being paid or credited for the content they create.\nHowever, thanks to blockchains, ownership rights can be restored in favor of artists. The very digital landscape that proves so difficult for artists could well increase the possibility of profits for artists online.\nPhysical art was one of the first big applications of blockchain technology.\nThe concept of integrating blockchain technology into the art industry is not untested. Blockchains have already been a part of the physical art world for a few years now as a reliable way to verify creation and ownership details. The application of a trustworthy system of verification like the blockchain to artworks makes perfect sense.\nA number of companies are actually already authenticating artwork with blockchain technology, including Verisart in Los Angeles, Tagsmart in London and Ascribe in Berlin. For both collectors and artists, they provide digital certificates of authenticity and provenance records that enable buyers to verify the authenticity of the artwork they purchase while creating an accredited ownership history for the artwork over time. \u00a0\nWhat blockchain technology provides is its unmodifiable digital ledger which logs every single digital transaction. More importantly, this ledger is public so everyone can see its history. This means, for example, that you can see that the painting you are interested in has been purchased three times from buyers in London, Madrid and Milan. Because the log is decentralized and cannot be edited, there is no potential for lies or trickery \u2014 no one can sell you a fake copy if a digital record of the authentic piece exists.\nBy allowing records like provenance, authorship and ownership to be unmodifiable, blockchain technology potentially solves the issue of forgeries and thefts in the art world. According to the FBI, billions of dollars worth of art and cultural property go missing every year. Being able to prove and track the ownership of artwork could make it almost impossible to resell stolen artwork in the future.\nBy increasing trust in the art world, blockchain technology could also help increase the value of art. One important factor in art is scarcity \u2014 it is what drives demand. People covet beautiful things: the more unique, the better. The Mona Lisa wouldn\u2019t likely be worth $2 billion if there were 10 originals on the market.\nBlockchain technology may pave the way for a robust new market of digital art.\nIt is no secret that life for digital artists can be difficult. In the music world, for example, physical sales are almost non-existent. Artists earn less than a cent from each time their music is played. At Spotify, the average payout for a stream to labels and publishers is between $0.006 and $0.0084. By the time the label has taken its share, artists receive an estimated $0.001128.\nThe digital art and design world is arguably just as bad \u2014 or worse. While individuals can easily download a music file from a file-sharing website, it is even easier to screenshot or share digital art without any attribution or financial benefit for the artist. As long as people don\u2019t consider digital assets \u201cobjects,\u201d digital artists won\u2019t be paid what their work is worth. However, being able to certify the ownership of digital assets through the blockchain could assure the value of digital art and change the behavior that it is okay to swipe art from the web without a thought. People already consume all kinds of creative content on digital screens, be it books, movies, media, or music. The time has come for them to value digital art they can appreciate just as thoroughly on their devices.\nA new generation of blockchain-based art collections is bringing the digital art and cryptocurrency worlds together.\nFor many people, a painting on the wall is worth money; but a digital work of art online has no financial value. A new business model, however, is now emerging for digital art that could alter this perspective.\nCryptoPunks by Larva Labs is one known example. The company has created 10,000 computer-generated digital characters, each one unique, with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Each one is owned by a single person and verified by a smart contract. As the blockchain data is public, you can see exactly which of the characters have been purchased and which remain available. Some people have spent 10 ETH (around $3,000) on the rarest types of CryptoPunks on the secondary market.\nAnother example is the selling of \u201cRare Pepes,\u201d crude depictions of the meme often used online as an alt-right symbol. Meme artists previously tried to watermark their memes; nevertheless, they continued to be downloaded and shared. The solution was to use the Counterparty platform, which allows users to make anything into a unique digital token. Now the Pepes can be bought and sold \u2014 the rarest costing $11,589 \u2014 with RarePepeWallet.com.\nThis is just the tip of the creative iceberg. Imagine the possibilities with digital art created by actual artists becoming desirable and more valuable. In addition, artists who otherwise would have been forced to use a large-scale centralized company to distribute their work are now able to distribute their work in a decentralized way and receive fair compensation.\nSoon, people may begin collecting digital art in the very same way they collect it in its physical form. This may also require a cultural shift in the perception of digital art and its value, but this cultural shift could well be instigated by applying technology, thereby adding financial value and scarcity to digital art. This may well turn out to be a significant boon in the lives of artists all over the world who will be able to profit and take control of their creative output and their intellectual property in a dynamic, budding market.\n\nVenezuelan artist and serial entrepreneur\u00a0Beatriz Helena Ramos\u00a0is the CEO of\u00a0dada.nyc.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 21}

As cryptocurrency continues to explode in value and public awareness, we can only expect this trend to continue. I was recently the target of such an attack. I also personally know of multiple other cases of the same attack being successfully carried out. Even worse, this type of attack is becoming ever more common and is likely to see an even bigger boost thanks to the professional excellence of firms like Equifax, making it an urgent topic as almost everyone is at immediate risk.\n\nThis article describes this increasingly common attack vector and provides immediate steps you can take to protect yourself. I will also provide additional tools and best practices to further safeguard yourself and your funds more generally.\n\nAs a computer programmer active in the crypto ecosystem since early 2013, I\u2019ve always been too aware of the constant threat of cybersecurity attacks and the possibility that I could be targeted at any time. Cryptocurrency is the perfect hacker pay day. Once it\u2019s transferred away from your control it\u2019s gone forever, and it\u2019s easily liquidated in any number of ways. Black hats are constantly prowling for possible cryptocurrency holders.\nAs such, I\u2019ve always taken the minimum precaution of keeping my coins off third-party accounts, and have always advised others to do the same. But what I couldn\u2019t prepare for was how unnerving being the target of an attack could be regardless of your level of preparation. The hypothetical can become reality in a matter of seconds, and you never truly understand the personal value of putting proper security in place until it\u2019s too late. For those with enough at stake, it can be ruinous. Ultimately none of my funds were compromised by this attack, but others have not been so lucky.\n\u201cBut not all accounts are created equal for data thieves\u200a \u2014 \u200aand the most valuable online accounts to steal are like the ones belonging to Mr. Burniske, who is a cryptocurrency fan. In the few minutes it took to get control of his phone, the virtual currency investor saw his virtual currency password change and its accounts drained of $150,000.\u201d -PYMNTS\nThe Attack\nIt started when I received a text message from my cellular service provider alerting me that my SIM card had been \u201cupdated.\u201d Included in the text was a number to call if this \u201cupdate\u201d wasn\u2019t in fact authorized by me. I read this text several minutes after it had been sent, and by the time I called the number provided a minute or two later, my cell service and data were suddenly cut off by what I began realizing must be an attacker. Almost immediately, I was also logged out of my Facebook messenger window right before my eyes. With control of my phone number, my attacker had managed to quickly reset my Facebook password and gain control of the account.\nAs the reality of what was happening to me sank in, I felt an initial wave of panic. Suddenly, I didn\u2019t know if the years of precautions I had taken amounted to anything at all. I had no idea how robust the attack was, how deep the attacker had penetrated my numerous online accounts or what my first reaction should even be. I momentarily feared the worst. Could my coins be at risk?\nI forced several deep breaths. Thankfully my coins were not at risk via a phone, social media or email hijacking. Reminding myself of this eased my fears and allowed me to focus on going on the defensive and taking back control of my accounts as quickly as I could.\nUsing FaceTime from my laptop, I was able to get a family member to call the number provided by my cellular provider\u2019s text message and initiate the process to eventually retake control of my phone number. Using an old email strictly used as an emergency recovery email for situations such as these, I was also able to lock down my Facebook account and regain control soon after.\nWhat I discovered once I logged back in confirmed that the attacker had specifically targeted me due to my public cryptocurrency involvement. In the brief span of time they controlled my Facebook account, they had sent the same message to several friends of mine also involved in the ecosystem, many of whom I\u2019ve known for years. The messages claimed I had an emergency and needed to borrow several bitcoins or the equivalent value in alternate coins for a day. The attacker was in the middle of sending out many more such messages to even more of my friends when I regained control.\n\nAt the end of the day, the damage done to myself was limited to being spooked. Unfortunately, however, at least one of the recipients of my fake Facebook messages was later the target of the same attack. I\u2019ve decided to learn from these events and share those lessons, and hopefully help some avert the worst. First and foremost is eliminating this specific and trivially easy attack vector completely.\nHow to Stop It Before It Happens\nText message two-factor authentication (2FA) is the default security precaution for most online accounts today, and cellular service providers are woefully unprepared for this reality. It is almost trivially easy for an attacker to contact your service provider and pretend to be you.\nIn all the cases I\u2019ve personally observed, it began with the attacker identifying an individual likely to have cryptocurrency and contacting their cell provider. They impersonate their target using personal information like social security numbers and home addresses from any number of possible leaks, Equifax being the most obvious and concerning source.\nAfter successfully convincing your cell provider that they are you, they then port your SIM card to a phone they control. This approach is known as a social engineering attack, and with today\u2019s common security default of using text messages for 2FA, they immediately have the keys to the kingdom. With your phone number they can now reset the password to any account you have with text 2FA enabled, including cryptocurrency wallets and accounts.\nThe minimal action you should take right now to prevent this: Contact your cellular service provider and request restrictions to be placed on your account so that no changes can be made to it without special verification. This can include setting a password on your account or requiring you to physically visit a store with your ID to make any account changes. Call again once this is in place and attempt to change your own SIM card as a test to ensure the restrictions have indeed been put in place and are being properly enforced by your cellular provider.\nThis simple step means that no matter what information an attacker may have on you, socially engineering a takeover of your SIM card is no longer a trivially simple endeavor. However, this precaution isn\u2019t ironclad, and there\u2019s also a variety of other attacks you can be the target of.\nTaking It a Step Further\nBlack hat actors tend to focus on the low-hanging fruit, which is why the social engineering SIM attack has become so prevalent. But it is by no means the only way to compromise your accounts, and as the low-hanging fruit become harder to find, attackers will move on to these other methods. I highly recommend everyone implement these precautionary steps to further secure yourselves. The upfront investment needed to set up these measures may seem tedious now, but can pay invaluable dividends in the future.\n1. If you hold any significant amounts of cryptocurrency, invest in an offline hardware storage solution. \nThese devices contain your cryptocurrency private keys and can remain completely disconnected from the internet or any computer until you need to make transactions, so that your funds remain totally safe regardless of any of your other devices or accounts being compromised. These devices include OpenDime, TREZOR and Ledger. Even if you do not opt for any of these solutions, at a bare minimum do not store funds on third-party services such as Coinbase or exchanges, especially on any service or wallet that integrates email or a phone number to authorize access to funds.\n2. Ditch text messaging 2FA. \nPlacing verification restrictions on your cellular service account is a big step up in security, but can still be circumvented by an insider or even just a careless customer service rep who doesn\u2019t do their job properly. Text message authorization is also still too incredibly insecure to be relied on in any way, period. Recent research shows that intercepting text messages is a trivial task for someone with the right tools, and many other exploits are likely to be discovered in the future.\nThe first item on this list will protect your personal funds from theft, but as I learned the hard way your money isn\u2019t the only thing at risk. With access to your social media accounts and emails, an attacker can trick your friends into giving them funds or exposing themselves in other ways. They\u2019ll also obviously have a clear look into all your messaging and file history on those accounts, which can expose you and your social circle even more. Shoring up your 2FA is a big step in preventing this.\nEliminate all of your text messaging\u2013based 2FA and at a minimum replace it with Google Authenticator. However, like storing cryptocurrency, you can take it a step further with a dedicated hardware solution. I highly recommend YubiKeys.\nYou can configure many major online accounts (not Coinbase yet) to require you to physically insert and activate your YubiKey as your 2FA authorization, eliminating the risk of a remotely compromised phone.\n3. Use multiple emails with interlinked recovery options, and use completely different and robust passwords for those emails and other online accounts alike. \nLuckily I did not have text messaging 2FA enabled on the email account associated with my Facebook profile; otherwise my attacker could have seized control of that as well. If they did, I have a chain of recovery emails I could have used to regain control of it, all with different passwords. This practice also means that having your password being captured or leaked for any one of your accounts won\u2019t jeopardize all of them.\n4. Stay vigilant, stay paranoid. \nTo quote the Onion Knight, \u201cSafety is never a permanent state of affairs.\u201d Don\u2019t get lazy and begin recycling passwords or leaving funds on Coinbase or other third-party accounts. Be aware of the technology you are using and the tradeoffs you are making or exposure you are generating by doing so. Stay up to date on the latest breaches, exploits and technology. Opt to use end-to-end encrypted messaging services like\u00a0Signal, Telegram or WhatsApp. Don\u2019t answer calls from strange phone numbers, and use apps like\u00a0Hiya to filter out known spam numbers to reduce the risk that you do. Ultimately, however, there is no easy fix for security and no list that can guarantee you won\u2019t get hacked.\nMake no mistake, there are individuals out there who want to harm you and are actively working to do so. The time needed to reasonably secure yourself can seem tedious and time-consuming up front, but can easily and quickly become a priceless investment as I and many others have learned firsthand.\u00a0\nThis guest post by Ariel Deschapell was originally published on Medium and is reproduced here under a Creative Commons License.

{"title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: Amid Continuing China Rumors, BTC Fails to Break Key Resistance", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-price-analysis-amid-continuing-china-rumors-btc-fails-break-key-resistance/", "birthday": "Sep 19, 2017 5:50 PM EST", "date": "2017-09-19 22:50:00", "content": "When it rains, it pours. Last week, news began to hit the crypto community that China was taking harsh measures to reign in their various cryptocurrency exchanges. Several exchanges closed down and others were given a deadline to properly cease trading operations. This news came hard on the heels of recent directives that banned ICOs in China, leading to dramatic drops in cryptocurreny prices across the board.\nAfter this latest news settled, bitcoin managed to slightly rally before topping out around $4100. However, early this week, rumors began to circulate that executives associated with Chinese exchanges are being prohibited from leaving China. At the time of this article, BTC-USD is sitting just at $3900 and is showing signs of further pullback:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, GDAX, Macro Fibonacci Retracement Values\nThe figure above shows the whole, macro bull run from the $1700s. One important feature of the trend shown above is the 61% retracement down to the $2900s. The retracement down to such a low value shows that sell pressure is very strong in the current market and hints toward bullish exhaustion within the macro trend. Another key feature to note is the following:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, GDAX, Failed 100% Retracement\nAn important test of this rally was the 100% retracement of the bear run, post-China news. Sitting just below the 23% Fibonacci Retracement lies the bear run. The test of the 100% retracement is important because that resistance line marks a strong shift in market sentiment. A failure to break through those values shows that, even though there was a strong rally, the market is still bearish in nature and is likely to continue. \nFigure 2 also shows several tests and rejections of the 2-Hour 200 EMA (Exponential Moving Average). The 200 EMA is a common tool used among traders to objectively view the state of the market compared to the prior trends. A trend existing below the 200 EMA is bearish in nature, and trends that show support on top of the 200 EMA are bullish in nature. \nAt the time of this article, the BTC-USD is displaying two failed tests of key resistance levels and its showing little sign of upward pressure. Currently, the trend is sandwiched between the 200 EMA and the 50 EMA. Both moving averages can used in conjunction to gauge just how strong the market is. Like the 200 EMA, the 50 EMA shows short-term bullish and bearish trends relative to the EMA line: Trends above are showing bullish traits, and trends below are showing bearish traits. \nRight now, we are in the middle of a crucial test of both support and resistance lines as the market decides where it will go next. A break below the 50 EMA will ultimate show the long-term bearish intent of the market and will lead to tests of the low support values:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Hour Candles, GDAX, Support Levels for Current Rally\nAt the moment, BTC-USD is making its third test of the current rally\u2019s 23% retracement values. A break below this line will have bitcoin testing the macro 38% retracement values in the $3700s. If bitcoin manages to break the 38% retracement values somehow, there will be strong support around the $3400s as the 50% macro Fibonacci Retracement values (shown in Figure 1) have historic significance and support.\nIf bitcoin is going to see any significant price growth within this rally, it will have to pick up some major buy volume and break through very strong, historic resistance values. It\u2019s extremely unlikely that, given its repeated failures to break resistance and the inherent bearish news looming over the Bitcoin community, BTC-USD will shove to new highs without strongly testing lower macro support.\nSummary:\nBTC-USD had a strong rally, but ultimately topped out around $4100.At the moment, BTC-USD is testing macro support levels and shows very little, significant upward strength.Should we break support in the $3900s, we can expect a test of the macro 38% Fibonacci Retracement values in the $3700s.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nVaultoro, a bitcoin-to-gold exchange, has secured funding from Finlab AG, a fintech company based in Frankfurt, Germany.\nVaultoro co-founder Joshua Scigala stated that the funding from Finlab will allow them to reach their goals faster. The first upgrade the company plans to implement will be a real-time gold-backed debit card. The card will allow the customers of the firm to hold their allocated gold \u2014 stored in a high-security Swiss bullion vault \u2014 while they can easily spend the funds anywhere Visa or Mastercard is accepted.\nThis latest funding announcement is in keeping with Vaultoro\u2019s history of seeking funding and support from venture capitalists and established players in the space, rather than following the recent ICO trend.\nIn 2015, Vaultoro conducted a BnkToTheFuture raise. The funds were raised primarily from VCs, as opposed to ICOs. That same year, it hit its first $1 million in gold traded on the platform and was one of three finalists from the blockchain space to compete for the BBVA Open Talent Competition in Barcelona, Spain. Most recently, Vaultoro was selected as one of eight startups for the 2017 Techstars Berlin program.\n\u201cWe decided against an ICO because coins that pay a dividend are not really legal yet, equity taken absolutely illegal[ly], and we didn\u2019t want to confuse the product with a utility coin when we don\u2019t need one. Also, we found that so many ICOs are scams and we didn\u2019t want to be associated with this kind of hype. We have been solidly working on making Vaultoro a name people can trust, a brand with the highest principles.\u201d\nHowever, Scigala is not opposed to ICOs in general: \n\u201cI\u2019m not saying ICOs are bad,\u201d he added. \u201cIn fact, I love them, I think they are the future of fundraising because they enable anyone to invest in startups. In fact, we want to launch an ICO later to enable our users to profit from our success, but we want it well thought-out and fully legal for our investors. For this reason, we decided on a standard VC funding round that would not only bring us money but also strategic contacts that will help us grow as quick as possible.\u201d\nGold on the Blockchain\nAccording to Vaultoro, the latest financial crises have been a cause for concern for citizens around the world. People are worried about leaving their fiat funds in a bank account while earning low or no interest. The Vaultoro debit card will allow its customers to hold their funds in gold without the need for a bank. \n\u201cWe see gold as a gateway to crypto. Many people don\u2019t trust crypto, they don\u2019t understand it, but they understand the 3000+ years of value that gold has held. We are currently building an easy-to-use euro/gold wallet so people can easily buy and save in gold. But here is the kicker. They will see a little button, spend your gold as SEPA, SWIFT, debit card or bitcoin. So, many people will want to see what that is,\u201d he said.\nA Secure Store of Value\n\u201cOur goal is to have real asset vaulting,\u201d said Scigala. \u201cWe have always been a bitcoin-only business but we will bring some other promising digital assets on board. IOTA, ETHEREUM and DASH will be the first. We will also be adding silver, platinum and palladium. The wallet software will enable you to tell the card which asset you would like to spend from.\u201d\nThe firm emphasized that all gold is allocated in the users\u2019 name as their legal property so that even if Vaultoro were to experience a negative event, users\u2019 gold holdings would be protected: even liquidators wouldn\u2019t be able to touch the assets of the company\u2019s clients.\n\u201cThe most important thing about Vaultoro is that all physical assets are allocated to the user and are not on the company balance sheet. That means if anything happens to Vaultoro as a company, no one, not even liquidators, can touch our clients\u2019 property because it has nothing to do with us. It\u2019s the full property of our clients. We are figuring out if digital currencies can also be allocated under bailment laws,\u201d Scigala said.\nBy allowing users to purchase gold for bitcoins and back, Vaultoro customers can benefit from the ease of BTC payments while investing in a stable asset. Unlike bitcoin or a lot of fiat currencies, gold has a very low volatility rate. Investors can invest and trade in cryptocurrencies; however, many of them dislike the volatility associated with them \u2014 especially when there is an event that drives the prices toward the bottom, like the recent Chinese regulations on bitcoin exchanges and ICOs.\n\u201cWe are also working on a maker-taker trading fee model for the marketplace so people that place orders into the market don\u2019t pay as much fee[s] as people taking an order from the order book. We hope to lift liquidity drastically.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 22}

The cryptocurrencies initially supported are Decred (DCR), Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC).\n\u201cSupport for on-chain atomic swaps is extremely useful,\u201dJake Yocom-Piatt, Decred Project Lead said in a statement. \u201cThanks to the foresight of the Lightning Network authors and developers, and the dedication of our own developers, it is our pleasure to deliver an important capability that has been discussed since the concept of cross-chain atomic transfers was proposed in 2013.\u201d \nUsers can already begin performing exchanges between DCR, BTC and LTC using tools that the Decred developers have created. The tools are text-based at the moment, but will be integrated into the Decrediton GUI wallet in a future release.\nAccording to the Decred team, this advancement disintermediates the exchange process, allowing for greater market fluency. It also delivers on the market desire for improved interoperability between currencies and the demand for new efficiencies that drive investor value.\n\"This is the first step in a progression toward high-utility, non-Turing complete smart contracts,\u201d Yocom-Piatt told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe look forward to a new generation of greater fluency between projects. It was a pleasure collaborating with the dev teams at Litecoin and Lighting Labs.\"\nThe concept of atomic swaps (or atomic cross-chain trading) were first described by Tier Nolan back in 2013. A previous Bitcoin Magazine article provides a step-by-step explanation of a simple example where two users agree to swap agreed amounts of BTC and LTC and use the multisig and time lock features available in both Bitcoin and Litecoin basic scripting to synchronize two transactions on two independent blockchains without having to trust each other.\n\nYesterday I did an on-chain atomic swap of 1.337 LTC for 2.4066 DCR w/ @_alyp_ of @decredproject.

By taking this process off-chain, substantial latency and privacy improvements can occur.\u201d \nDecred (DCR) describes itself as \u201cdigital currency for the people,\u201d completely independent, community funded and community owned. The project wants to build an open and progressive cryptocurrency with a system of community-based governance integrated into its blockchain, \u00a0including a hybrid consensus system to ensure that no group can control the flow of transactions or make changes to the currency without the input of the community.\n\u201cDecred is Bitcoin as it should have been,\u201d noted crypto-investor Jon Creasy. \u201cBitcoin would be of the people, for the people. As great an idea as this was, however, Bitcoin soon became controlled by an \u2018oligarchy,\u2019 so to speak.\u201d\nIt\u2019s important to note that some countries, such as China, are attacking cryptocurrency exchanges as the weakest links in the crypto ecosystem. The Decred move shows that, at least for crypto-to-crypto trading (for example, exchanging bitcoin for litecoin), it\u2019s perfectly possible to operate without exchanges. However, it doesn\u2019t solve the problem of crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto trading, which is arguably of top concern for cryptocurrency users.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 20}
{"title": "Op Ed: Four Challenges to Consider When Launching Your Fund Raise on the Blockchain", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-four-challenges-consider-when-launching-your-fund-raise-blockchain/", "birthday": "Sep 21, 2017 4:08 PM EST", "date": "2017-09-21 21:08:00", "content": "ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) or token sales have seen a dramatic increase over the past year as a method for raising capital. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin market capitalization sits at around $70 billion at the time of writing (even after the China ICO market correction), up from $11 billion in June 2016. Overall, the cryptocurrency market cap is now over $150 billion, roughly the size of Algeria or Iraq\u2019s GDP.\nMany organizations have, therefore, become interested in using token sales (aka ICOs and token generation events) as a way of raising capital. Mostly, companies look at token sales as a way to raise startup capital; they issue \u201cutility tokens\u201d to avoid being classified as a security. This method is in line with traditional \u201ccrowdfunding\u201d that companies have been doing for many years.\nI also believe there is a lot of pent up demand from traditional asset classes and established companies to utilize the blockchain to raise capital and conduct their business. This is because there are a many benefits for both the issuer and the investor.\nFor the issuer, it\u2019s a frictionless process of raising capital that opens up a global market of potential investors. Costs of raising capital via this process can be a fraction of what it may cost to address the same size market with a traditional raise.\nFor the investor, it provides access to a wider range of investment opportunities, which a regular person may never otherwise have access to. Typically, there are zero or very low investment minimums, and one can easily participate in a token sale anywhere on the globe \u2014 just set up a wallet, buy some bitcoin or ether, and get in on time. As a bonus, there\u2019s also often the existence of a secondary market where tokens can be traded after the initial token sale, thus providing fast liquidity to those that desire it.\nHowever, the process is not without its challenges, and there are several things to consider when launching your next fund offering on the blockchain.\nWhat are traditional asset classes and why may a blockchain be of benefit to them?\nTraditional asset classes are those that generally come up when people talk about investments. They include stocks, commodities, real estate, private equity funds and derivatives, VC funds, REITs and others.\nMost, if not all, traditional assets would fall under the SEC\u2019s definition of a security, as stipulated by the Howey test. However, due to the decentralized nature of blockchains, the U.S. is not the only jurisdiction where tokens can be sold from; many countries around the world such as Switzerland, Cayman Islands, Estonia and others are stepping up to welcome ICOs, be they utilities or a securities. \nSo, how is blockchain technology and tokenization beneficial to traditional asset classes? Consider this example based on the logic illustrated by Stephen McKeon. If we take real estate as an example, it\u2019s estimated that the size of commercial real estate in the U.S. alone is about $11 trillion. Let\u2019s say 10 percent of that can be tokenized; that immediately puts over $1 trillion of liquidity back into the marketplace and removes an \u201cilliquidity premium\u201d which issuers are forced to pay because investors have no way to exit their investment for a number of years. This is a win-win for both the issuer and the investor.\nChallenge #1 \u2013 Jurisdiction \nEven if one decides to tokenize an existing asset, there are several challenges that must be addressed, and finding the right home for your fund is key. \u00a0Since most traditional assets may be considered a security, finding the right jurisdiction will be very important during and immediately following your token generating event. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the options available to us today. \nThe State of Delaware has a newly invoked law that will allow businesses to maintain shareholder lists and other corporate records on the blockchain. This move is even more significant when you consider that this jurisdiction is the corporate domicile capital of America, with 66% of Fortune 500 companies calling it home. If your plan is to make token holders Limited Partners or equity holders of your new fund, this may be a reasonable option. \nAlso in the U.S., Regulation A, Regulation A+ and Regulation D contain rules that could exempt entities selling securities from registering with the SEC, including a specific look at equity crowdfunding. These rules can be applied to any crowd sale, and potentially encompass token sales as well. It\u2019s also possible to raise under Regulation S, which would exclude U.S. investors altogether, thereby removing the need for protection of unaccredited investors.\nSwitzerland, one of the leading centers of capital in Europe and known for recently abolishing its banking secrecy laws, has become a fintech hub and is considered a friendly jurisdiction. A number of leading Swiss companies have formed an alliance called Crypto Valley, where one of the most prominent law firms, MME, hosted a recent conversation about the legalities of token sales and what may constitute a security under Swiss law.\nThe Cayman Islands, a leading offshore jurisdiction with a 0 percent tax rate for foreign-controlled companies, have seen an uptick in ICOs lately. Recent token sales events from the Caymans include EOS, Domain Developers Fund and others. The Cayman Islands and other offshore jurisdictions have taken a friendly view on blockchain assets and have the service provider infrastructure in place, with lots of experience creating and operating traditional funds. I believe incorporating in the Caymans and other offshore jurisdictions have many benefits and is a practice that will continue to increase.\nEstonia is another interesting example of a jurisdiction where several ICOs \u2014 which would almost certainly be considered securities in the U.S. \u2014 have been domiciled. Recently, Agrello, Polybius and a number of other companies completed successful token sales. Estonia is unique because of its e-government initiatives, which encompass e-citizenship, e-voting, e-tax and government blockchains. Further, Estonia recently announced its own cryptocurrency called Estcoin. Estonia currently doesn\u2019t regulate crowdfunding (though some EU laws may apply) and is one of the top friendly jurisdictions for launching tokenized funds.\nChallenge #2 \u2013 Knowing Your Customer\nAnother roadblock to conducting legal and compliant token sales is the issuer\u2019s ability to follow KYC and AML regulations effectively. KYC (Know Your Customer) is the method in which issuers verify the identity of its investors. Many cryptocurrencies of choice for token generation events have anonymity features built in (cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Zcash are prime examples, and bitcoin can be anonymized as well). Further, the crypto investment community likes the idea of not having to go through lengthy and intrusive KYC processes. This practice doesn\u2019t bode well for the issuer, however, since KYC is a key requirement for many banks. Strong KYC during the token generating event will make it easier to work with banks and follow AML (Anti Money Laundering) regulations. \nChallenge #3 \u2013 Tax, Compliance and Custody\nThere are further complications with taxes, compliance and custody. There are not yet clear standards for cryptocurrency compliance to be followed. Further, if your fund is going to be holding crypto-assets and cryptocurrencies, security and custody needs to be considered. Luckily, there are some players such as Gemini that offer crypto-custody services; some reputable banks such as the Swiss Falcon Private Bank are also starting to offer bank-level cryptocurrency trading services. There are still more challenges around custody and compliance for altcoins.\nOn the tax side, there are open questions about treatment of virtual currencies. IRS guidance 2014-12 classifies cryptocurrencies as an asset class, imposing capital gains taxes on profits in certain situations. Some other countries such as Vietnam have proposed making digital currencies like bitcoin a form of currency. The world tax authorities still need more time to figure out how to tax this new asset class.\nChallenge #4 \u2013 What Happens Next?\nOnce you\u2019ve jumped through a lot of hoops and successfully executed a tokenization event for your fund, the real work starts. If you accepted U.S. investors, think about how you can prevent them from selling your tokens in the first 12 months (if you raised under Regulation D). If you didn\u2019t accept U.S. investors, how do you prevent them from buying your tokens in the future? What exchanges do you want to list on to make sure you can comply with AML and other regulations? This is a complex process that needs to be thought of before you start planning your token generation event.\nLooking to the Past\nLaunching a tokenized fund on the blockchain is a relatively new concept; however, we have some successful precedents. The biggest and most interesting example is Blockchain Capital, founded by Brock Pierce. Their token, BCAP, was sold under Regulation D exemption to 99 accredited U.S. investors (and unlimited foreign investors with many exceptions), who, per SEC regulation, can\u2019t sell their tokens for 12 months. Blockchain Capital has a complex structure, with entities in Singapore, the Cayman Islands and the U.S. According to their memorandum, they spent up to 10 percent of their raise on legal expenses (they raised $10 million), which is a hefty sum. Also, questions remain: What prevents non-accredited U.S. investors from buying BCAP tokens post ICO?

CarbonX will achieve this by investing in carbon reduction projects and re-casting generated offsets as ERC20 tokens on an Ethereum Blockchain.\n\u201cCarbonX\u2019s ultimate goal is to become the global exchange for peer-to-peer personal carbon trading.\u201d\nDon Tapscott, chair of the CarbonX board of directors said in a post:\n\u201c... climate change is arguably the world\u2019s most daunting challenge. Virtually every scientist now agrees that the debate is over. Rising average surface temperatures combined with rapidly expanding deserts, melting Arctic sea ice caps and ocean acidification now provide unequivocal evidence that human activities are fundamentally altering the Earth\u2019s climate.\u201d\nConsenSys was one of the first startups to build practical applications for the Ethereum blockchain. Their mission is to create simplified and automated decentralized applications (dApps) to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions and exchanges, principally on the Ethereum blockchain.\nIn a statement, ConsenSys founder and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin said:\n\u201cAs one of the fastest growing companies working on Ethereum, a platform that is poised to reformat how the world organizes itself, ConsenSys is committed to enabling technologies to be built that will facilitate attention to externalities like pollution and critical new foundations like sustainability.\n\u201cCarbonX has the potential to incentivize behavior that contributes to environmental sustainability, and is an excellent example of Ethereum-based technologies poised to make positive change,\u201d added Lubin.\nThe CarbonX Token CxT\nThe CarbonX initiative will buy carbon credits from environmentally sustainable practices like ridesharing and will invest in carbon reduction projects like tree planting and convert this value to Ethereum ERC20 tokens known as CxT tokens.\nCarbonX will be announcing a formal token launch in the near future. CxT tokens will be distributed through an open-loop-style loyalty rewards program. The CxTs will then be tradeable on the CarbonX platform and be able to be exchanged for carbon-friendly goods and services, other reward program points or other digital currencies.\nFor verification, CarbonX will use industry-standard carbon offsets like the REDD and VCS offsets (for example, to apply to ridesharing) and will convert these into CxT tokens.\nInvestments in carbon reduction projects that will generate offsets will use government protocols, such as those developed by the Ontario provincial government, for example. \n\u201cThe CxTs will be awarded by enterprises who encourage ridesharing, and brands/retailers who wish to feature products that are carbon-friendly. We will provide guidelines, and consumers/users will be able to track overall performance. In the example of rideshare, we plan to work with companies like Luum and their clients to incent carbon-friendly behaviors. There are many ways we can boost awareness and responsibility for personal action in the fight,\u201d explained Tapscott.\nWell-known environmentalist Richard Sandor, chair and CEO of Environmental Financial Products and founder of the Chicago Climate Exchange, has endorsed the CarbonX initiative, saying:\n\u201cBlockchain technology has the potential to further expand the applications of market-based mechanisms to help solve environmental concerns. I am pleased to support CarbonX as another positive step towards transparency, accountability and lower transaction costs.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 25}

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nImagine a country where you could live free without a central government telling you who to be, what to do and how to act. Roger Ver does, and he is inviting people to join him on a ground level in plans for creating a libertarian utopia.The early Bitcoin investor and voluntaryist (someone who advocates nonviolent strategies to achieve a free society) took the stage last week at Nexus Conference, a three-day event in Aspen hosted by the cryptocurrency platform Nexus Earth, to announce Free Society, a project aimed at raising money to organize the venture. Ver, who is founding the project along with Olivier Janssens, another early Bitcoin investor, stated he has already raised $100 million, but hopes to raise plenty more.As Ver explained to a surprised audience, who settled into their seats expecting a talk about Bitcoin Cash, he is currently negotiating with different countries to purchase sovereign land with the hope that fellow libertarians will begin populating the area in one to two years.Bitcoin Magazine caught up with Ver in Aspen to learn more about his ambitious plans for a free country. \u00a0\u00a0Non-CountryInspiration for the libertarian country or \u201cnon country,\u201d as Ver called it, comes from David Friedman\u2019s The Machinery of Freedom, a book that explores the idea of a society organized by private property, individual rights and voluntary cooperation. Ver\u2019s dream is to create a free society where people voluntarily abide by a set of rules they sign off on when purchasing a land title. \u201cIt will be a new experiment where it is the first time it\u2019s been tried in the world,\u201d he said. The Bitcoin enthusiast hopes to raise more money for more land. \u201cI think very realistically, we can raise half a billion dollars and maybe a billion dollars. If we have a billion dollars, we will have a lot more capital to play with for a bigger piece of land,\u201d he said.Right now, the seed funding comes from early Bitcoin and Ethereum adopters. \u201cI\u2019m one of them,\u201d he said. He would not disclose who the others are, saying if they wanted to come forward, that was up to them. \u00a0But the general idea was to open the door to the public. \u201cWe were planning to have an ICO, but the regulators have kind of gotten in the way of that at the moment. But basically, we are working out the details as to how people can participate directly,\u201d he said. Ver added that this type of project is only possible due to cryptocurrency. \u201cThanks to cryptocurrencies, now there is a way to fundraise for people all over the world who are interested in this. Myself and my other friends all have a fair amount of capital now because of cryptocurrency. Dying with a pile of money isn\u2019t any fun, so let\u2019s make the world a better place,\u201d he said. Search for LandBut before he can build out his libertarian paradise, Ver and his team need to find some land to buy. He doesn\u2019t see that as being an issue though.\u201cWe have approached a number of different governments already, and we have actually been really surprised at how eager they are. Governments love money, and so, we will have to negotiate the final details.\u201d Of course, they have criteria. \u201cWe want to have a seaport, we want to be geographically close to other economic powerhouses so we have trading partners. We don\u2019t want to be out in the middle of nowhere,\u201d he said, adding that something close to Europe or South America or parts of Asia would be best. \u00a0\u00a0Once they buy the land, the next step is putting the infrastructure in place. \u201cWhen we auction off the land, we suspect a lot of the people who would be most interested in buying land will be development companies that will want to develop the land into big buildings,\u201d he said. \u00a0GovernanceThe concept of libertarianism revolves around the idea that order evolves spontaneously, rather than through some central authority pushing out arbitrary laws.Still, for many, it can be hard to imagine how that might work exactly. How will the country resolve disputes? What if someone gets out of line? \u00a0Right now, decisions are easy because so far only a handful of people are involved, said Ver. Otherwise, instead of laws, there will be guidelines similar to what someone might agree to before joining a condominium homeowner\u2019s association. \u201cEverybody can do whatever they want within the guidelines, and they will be agreeing to the guidelines by the time they purchase in. There will not be a government. It will all be private institutions and private organizations,\u201d he said. \u00a0The idea is to purchase land from a government that will allow sovereign behavior. \u201cWe are guessing that the governments will still try saying things like, you can\u2019t export drugs, you can\u2019t have nuclear weapons and that sort of thing,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI think the main answer is there isn\u2019t going to be some centralized institution imposing these rules. That is what we are trying to escape.\u201d He also emphasized that there would be no taxes. People would need to raise money for roads and other projects on their own.Who Will Live There?What will people do for work in the country? \u201cWe suspect it will be a lot of people working on the internet,\u201d said Ver, adding that he thinks 90 percent of the population will come from the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.And will citizens be forced to use cryptocurrency? \u201cPeople will be free to use whatever form of money they want,\u201d said Ver. But whatever the case, he made it clear, the time to act was now. \u201cLife is short,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to move quickly.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 25}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe scaling debate has dominated the Bitcoin space for well over two years now. As a central issue, Bitcoin\u2019s one-megabyte block size limit was often insufficient to include all transactions on the network. This ultimately led to the replacement of this block size limit for a block weight limit through Segregated Witness, allowing for up to four megabytes of transaction data. And a group of Bitcoin companies plans to deploy a hard fork to double this by November.But there is reason to believe the \u201ccrisis\u201d may have been fabricated, at least partly. A recent analysis by \u201cLaurentMT,\u201d the developer of blockchain analytics tool OXT, in cooperation with Antoine Le Calvez, creator of Bitcoin statistics resource p2sh.info, shows that the Bitcoin network has had to deal with a load of spam transactions throughout the past two years. Now, in a three-part blog post series dubbing the spam attacks \u201cMoby Dick,\u201d their findings suggest that several major Bitcoin mining pools may have had a hand in this.\u201cSix or seven pools have played a major role in stuffing blocks with spam transactions,\u201d LaurentMT said. \u201cAnd charts display what looks like a coordination between these pools.\u201dThe Spam SituationThe very concept of \u201cspam\u201d in the context of Bitcoin is sometimes disputed. Differentiating between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d transactions can be controversial on a network designed for permissionlessness innovation and censorship-resistant payments.But there is little doubt that certain transactions serve no other purpose than to stuff the Bitcoin network and blockchain. LaurentMT and Le Calvez more specifically define spam as transactions that send lots of tiny fractions of bitcoins to lots of different outputs (\u201caddresses\u201d). These kinds of transactions can\u2019t feasibly have been used to make actual payments, while they do present a significant burden on the Bitcoin network: all nodes need to receive, validate, transmit and (at least temporarily) store all this data.The analysts found that the Bitcoin network has seen many transactions that fit this category: almost three gigabytes worth of data within a two-year span, adding up to more than 2 percent of the total size of the blockchain, or the equivalent of about a month\u2019s worth of normal Bitcoin use.\u201cWe found that there were four waves of \u2018fan-out transactions\u2019 during summer 2015,\u201d LaurentMT told Bitcoin Magazine, referring to the transactions that create lots of outputs. \u201cWe think that the first two waves were spamming users and services. The third and fourth waves instead mostly sent the fractions of bitcoins to addresses controlled by the attackers themselves.\u201dThese four waves of spam have been relatively easy to notice, as sudden bursts of transactions clogged up the Bitcoin network for brief periods of time. In some cases these spam attacks were even announced as \u201cstress tests\u201d or \u201cbitcoin giveaways.\u201dWhat\u2019s more interesting about LaurentMT and Le Calvez\u2019s analysis is that the two focused on the second half of the puzzle. Almost all the fractions of bitcoins that were sent to all these different addresses have slowly been re-spent back into circulation since. These \u201cfan-in\u201d transactions were not as obvious as the initial waves of spam \u2014 but were similarly burdensome.And, LaurentMT explained, blockchain analysis suggests that most of this spam can be tracked down to one or two entities:\u201cWe\u2019ve identified two wallets that seem to have played a central role in the attacks. They\u2019ve funded long chains of fan-out transactions during summer 2015, and they later aggregated the dust outputs.\u201dThe analysts also suggest that the perpetrator(s) of the spam may have been customers of the Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX. But that\u2019s where their analysis stops.The Mining PoolsPerhaps what is more interesting is who used this spam to fill up Bitcoin blocks: Bitcoin mining pools.The spam outputs, generated by the first four waves of fan-out transactions, had been starting to move since autumn of 2015 \u2014 sort of. Whoever controlled these addresses had been broadcasting transactions to spend these outputs over the network. However, for a long time, miners did not include these \u201cspam broadcasts\u201d in their blocks; the transactions were ignored.Up until the second half of 2016, that is. At a very specific point in time, a group of seven mining pools started to suddenly accept these spam broadcasts and include them in the blocks they mined: 1-Hash, Antpool, BitClub Network, BTC.com, HaoBTC, KanoCKPool and ViaBTC.\u201cSo, either these seven pools had an \u2018aha moment,\u2019 and suddenly discovered that Bitcoin is about censorship resistance. Or, they had another motivation to fill up blocks with these transactions \u2014 perhaps related to the block size debate,\u201d LaurentMT suggested.For more clues, LaurentMT and Le Calvez looked for notable events that happened around the time of the mining pools\u2019 sudden change of heart. In their research, they did find some correlation with \u201cstrange\u201d occurrences. The first is an open letter from HaoBTC (now rebranded as Bixin) to the Bitcoin Core development team. The second was a rumor about a group of Chinese pools planning to end their cooperation with Bitcoin Core: the Terminator Plan.Of course, something notable happens in Bitcoin just about every week. These events may well be coincidences and, therefore, there could be a very different explanation for the mining pools\u2019 behavior, LaurentMT acknowledged:\u201cAn alternative explanation could be that the different mining pools adopted new mining policies for completely different reasons. I tend to think political motivations are more likely \u2026 but that\u2019s just a personal opinion.\u201dBitcoin Magazine reached out to the seven mining pools in question. The only mining pool willing to comment on the issue was KanoCKPool, which denied being involved with any sort of manipulation or coordination, stating it just confirms \u201cany and all transactions available.\u201dUPDATE:\u00a0After publication of this article (and on reading the comment from Kano CK Pool), LaurentMT pointed out that Kano CK Pool, along with 1Hash and Bitclub Network, are the only pools that had been confirming some of the spam transactions even before the second half of 2016, indicating that the pool could be telling the truth.UPDATE (2): A representative for Bixin reached out to Bitcoin Magazine to point out that the HaoBTC mining pool had only just started operations at the time when the different mining pools started including spam transactions in their blocks. He said the pool has always confirmed any paying transaction, and denies that HaoBTC (or Bixin) has taken part in any coordination across mining pools.For a full analysis of the \u201cMoby Dick\u201d spam, read LaurentMT and Le Calvez\u2019s three-part blog post series or watch Le Calvez\u2019s presentation at Breaking Bitcoin in Paris earlier this month.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 27}

Amid global turmoil and Chinese news that initially appeared to be bearish, BTC-USD has seemingly found its bottom and is now working its way onward and upward. Here is a look at the current state of the market and what we can expect in the coming days:Figure 1: BTC-USD, 6 Hour Candles, GDAX, Macro Fibonacci Retracement ValuesAt the time of this article, BTC-USD is encountering resistance along the 61% macro retracement values. Resistance at these values is expected to be strong because it had found previously strong support during the beginning stages of the previous bear run. It\u2019s not expected to make a clean break, so a possible, small retracement may pull the market back slightly before continuing upward. Even though we may see a slight pullback, it was very clear that the market is now leaning bullish:The market is currently finding support on the 6-hour candle\u2019s 200 and 50 EMAs. Typically, when the market is trending below the 200 EMA it is said to be \u201cbearish,\u201d and when the market is trending above the 200 EMA it said to be \u201cbullish.\u201dThe current market trend is pushing the price to new local highs. A trend that brings new highs shows a changing of tides as the bears begin to capitulate and the bulls begin to take over.On our current rise, the volume is increasing. When the volume increases within the trend, it shows there is strength in the current direction and is likely to continue.The 6-hour MACD is showing no signs of divergence and every new high is being accompanied with new highs on the MACD histogram. Currently the macro trend is showing strength with bullish momentum.If we zoom into a small timeframe and look at the 2-hour candle trend, we can see a similar, bullish sentiment beginning to form:Figure 2: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, GDAX, EMA CrossInside the rectangle within Figure 2, we can see that the 200 and 50 EMAs have crossed and are now showing a positive slope with their curves. Historically, the 200 and 50 EMAs for the 2-hour candles have been a great indicator as to the immediate health of the market. If a bear market makes a strong enough move upward and the 50 EMA crosses the 200 EMA to the top, this market activity is sometimes referred to as a \u201cGolden Cross.\u201d It\u2019s called a Golden Cross because it is a strong market indicator that usually shows the turning of the tides as the bearish traders give way to the bullish traders.Although there may be some pullback before we climb any higher, we have strong support in the $4100s so it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if we made a test of that support level before climbing onward. The $4100s also coincides with the 38% retracement. The 38% retracement is a very common retracement value within strong bull runs. Markets rarely make decisive, healthy moves in a singular direction. Often, they take a stair-step type of trend that moves up, retraces, moves up, retraces, ettc. The 38% can be seen as the first stair within our current bull market.Summary:BTC-USD managed to make a new high and break the multi-week long descending trendline.BTC-USD is showing macro trend strength but will likely see a little pullback before continuing higher.If we do see a pullback, we can expect strong support in the $4100s.Trading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The fund is open to pre-qualified investors according to specific country regulations. In the U.S., the relevant regulation is Regulation D, Rule 506(c).\u201cWhile equity crowdsourcing brought startup investments to the public, we are hoping that SPiCE with its liquidity and inclusivity will bring more people to investing in a venture capital fund, taking the portfolio approach, and avoiding the inherent risk of investing into a single startup or ICO,\u201d said Carlos Domingo, co-founder and managing partner of SPiCE and a former CEO of Telefonica R&D.SPiCE wants to leverage blockchain technology to disrupt the venture capital industry with regulatory-compliant, tradable securities tokens that entitle holders to 100 percent of net exit revenues. The Ethereum-based SPiCE token will act as a digital security, assuring that token holders get their share of the exits when they occur, and a tradable asset.SPiCE advisers include Brendan Eich, inventor of JavaScript and co-founder of Mozilla and Brave, which launched the Basic Attention Token ICO; Eyal Hertzog, co-founder of Metacafe and co-founder and architect of Bancor; and entrepreneur Lo\u00efc Le Meur, co-founder of LeWeb. SPiCE is also partnering with the Aragon Network, a digital jurisdictional platform for decentralized organizations based on digital tokens.\u201cWe are excited about SPiCE\u2019s decision to utilize the Bancor protocol to add liquidity to its security token,\u201d said Hertzog. \u201cThe extreme efficiency that blockchain and smart contracts technologies enable resulted in a volume of ICO crowdfunding for blockchain companies that has surpassed traditional early stage VC investment, and now with SPiCE VC, this revolution is coming for the funding of VCs themselves.\u201d\u201cFor me joining SPiCE VC was a no-brainer, after being in the tech industry for more than twenty years, this is the most exciting project with the best team that I have been working in my entire career,\u201d Domingo told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine.In March of 2017, Blockchain Capital launched a similar liquidity-enhanced venture capital fund called Blockchain Capital III: a combination of a traditional limited partnership and the Ethereum-based BCAP digital token. According to Brock Pierce, the fund provides \u201cthe investor base across the globe with the opportunity to invest into a leading venture fund via a liquid, tradable, digital token.\u201d \"SPiCE is building on the pioneering work of Brock Pierce for Blockchain Capital and taking it to the next level by providing a mechanism for our token holders to have a direct economic interest in our fund rather, than an indirect one as in the Blockchain Capital case,\u201d said Domingo. \u201cIn their case, Blockchain Capital uses part of the exit proceedings to buy tokens on the open market to raise their price so token holders can sell them, while SPiCE transfers the money of the proceedings from exiting startups directly to our token holders via buybacks from them directly and not the open market. This way, we have less dependency on the liquidity level of tokens for the token holders to benefit. Also, to increase liquidity from the beginning, we are implementing the Bancor smart reserve.\u201d Domingo also said that whereas Blockchain Capital is an evergreen fund that reinvests up to 100 percent of all exit proceedings back into the fund, SPiCE is a closed ended fund that will be returning 100 percent of the proceedings form the exits to the token holders.\u201cWe are very excited about how advances in blockchain technology can actually solve one of the major problems of investing in VC funds, having your investment tied into the fund for 7\u201310 years before you can see any returns,\u201d Domingo said. \u201cWe also believe that this increased liquidity will bring inclusivity as well, and will open up the option to invest in VC funds to a new breed of investors that have been left out of this asset class till SPiCE VC appeared.\u201d The SPiCE fund will invest in promising pre-series-A and pre-ICO technology startups, bridging the gap between seed funding from angels or incubators, and the first-series-A or ICO funding round. \u201cSPiCE VC will focus on companies in that gap, either pre-series-A or pre-ICO, because once a company crosses the chasm, it achieves the fastest growth in valuation, which SPiCE investors may benefit from via its liquidity,\u201d notes the announcement.The SPiCE token ICO is scheduled for late November.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 28}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nEnterprise blockchain provider Gem is forging new partnerships in the healthcare sector. First announced at the Distributed: Health 2017 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, earlier this week, the blockchain startup is teaming up with European technology service provider Tieto as well as with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\u201cWe fundamentally believe that data should not be centralized; it should exist at the edges where it already lives. Gem is partnering with Tieto and the CDC to build fluid systems of bridges and tunnels that connect relevant data at the time it\u2019s needed,\u201d Gem founder and CEO Micah Winkelspecht told Bitcoin Magazine.TietoThe growing interest in blockchain technology does not appear to be slowing down. As just about every industry is researching whether and how blockchains can help their operations, the healthcare sector is no exception. Distributed: Health, the world\u2019s only healthcare-focused blockchain conference, welcomed over 700 attendees to Nashville this week.Among the interested parties was Tieto, a major technology service provider in northern Europe, which typically works closely with several Scandinavian governments. The company provides software solutions for a range of public sector agencies, in domains like forestry, finance and education, as well as healthcare.In Nashville, Gem and Tieto announced their new partnership in the exploration of how blockchain technology can benefit the tech giant. Emily Vaughn, head of accounts at Gem, and Maria Kumle, head of new offerings (Lifecare Solutions) at Tieto, presented a keynote address on Tuesday morning outlining the companies\u2019 shared vision for the future of healthcare and how their partnership will build blockchain-based compliance solutions.\u201cTieto has a pretty big vision for the future,\u201d Winkelspecht told Bitcoin Magazine after the presentation. \u201cThey believe in a shift from a provider-centric data model to a more citizen-centric data model. They think citizens should really be in control of their own data, where companies can leverage and use that data, if the user consents.\u201dGem\u2019s main product, GemOS, is a data collaboration platform to be deployed on blockchains like Ethereum and Hyperledger, a software stack to bridge the gaps between these blockchains\u2019 enterprise-level applications. For Tieto, GemOS will be configured to connect different data silos, specifically Finnish blood banks and DNA registers.Winkelspecht said:\u201cIf, say, a life insurer needs access to your health records and that data is stored in 10 different locations, that insurer first needs to know what these locations are. Then it needs to demonstrate to all these locations that it has the rights to access this. And it should be able to pull them all down, to have availability to the data.\u201dBecause this is still a very bureaucratic, slow and expensive process, Gem and Tieto believe they can streamline the localization and authorization of this data. While the different silos will remain siloed \u2014 the blood bank records and DNA registers won\u2019t be stored on any blockchain \u2014 GemOS should provide the bridge to connect the relevant data where needed.CDCPrior to the conference, Gem also struck a recent deal with the CDC, the United States federal agency tasked with preventing the spread of disease.The CDC is particularly interested in finding solutions to better manage population health data and, more specifically, data relevant for disaster response. This type of data is usually fed through several intermediaries, such as different local government bodies. And because this is still very much a manual process, getting the right information to the right departments can take weeks or even longer. This current level of inefficiency is of particular concern in emergency situations where time is of the essence. On top of further automating their processes, the CDC thinks that blockchain technology may offer additional solutions. It has therefore already put together a 27-person blockchain development team and is also partnering with different blockchain providers, including Microsoft and IBM, in addition to Gem.\u201cThe CDC wants to build a blockchain-based early-detection warning system for population health and other topics that they care about,\u201d Winkelspecht explained. \u201cOnce again, we won\u2019t put actual data on the blockchain, but what we\u2019re trying to do is paint a clear, comprehensive picture of all the data that is available, with a validity check, a timestamp and a proof.\u201dThese records should then be instantly available to other relevant parties in the disaster relief efforts, like doctors or pharmacies. Such real-time data-sharing solutions among parties could significantly benefit CDC\u2019s mission, especially when it comes to contagious diseases. Both the Tieto and CDC projects are still in early development phases. It could take another year before the projects are up and running.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 28}

The new cryptocurrency would be managed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and could be called \u201cLakshmi.\u201d Other central banks are exploring similar ideas.\nOf course, that will take time, and the governments are unlikely to support important features that make Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appealing to end users, such as mining and near-anonymous, paperwork-free transactions. Therefore, Bitcoin, Ethereum and at least some altcoins are likely to continue to prosper.\nBut some governments, such as China\u2019s, don\u2019t seem to like that. After banning Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), the Chinese government is moving to close the cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country.\nIt appears that governments love blockchain technology but hate Bitcoin itself, as well as other \u201ccrypto-anarchic\u201d digital currencies. Some governments are reacting in a panic because they are starting to realize that they can\u2019t stop Bitcoin from becoming an alternative to their monopoly on currency, both as a means of exchange and a store of value. Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are especially vulnerable, and other governments could follow China.\nA Role for Decentralized Exchanges\nDecentralized exchanges that use peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to bypass the need for a central exchange provider are an interesting option that could make blockchain-based digital currencies much more resilient.\nDecred recently introduced atomic swap support for exchange-free cryptocurrency trading, showing that, at least for crypto-to-crypto trading (for example, exchanging bitcoin for litecoin), it\u2019s perfectly possible to operate without exchanges. However, this doesn\u2019t solve the problem of crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto trading, which is arguably of top concern for cryptocurrency users.\n\u201cAtomic swaps are the first sign in a new wave of decentralization,\u201d Decred project lead Jake Yocom-Piatt told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAs trustless exchanges between pairs of cryptocurrencies, they offer new efficiencies for users who don\u2019t need the formality of the traditional exchanges. It is going to be interesting to see how the trend develops, since for larger and more complex transactions with fiat currencies, LocalBitcoins and established exchanges are still the place to be.\u201d \u00a0\nCoinffeine is developing an open-source, P2P Bitcoin exchange platform that will enable users to buy and sell bitcoins securely and anonymously, without having to rely on a centralized exchange. The project seems promising, but it hasn\u2019t shown much activity recently.\nBisq (formerly Bitsquare) provides an open-source desktop application that allows users to buy and sell bitcoins anonymously in exchange for national currencies or alternative cryptocurrencies. To protect users from fraud, both traders are required to place security deposits into a multisig-based escrow mechanism; the deposits are refunded after a trade completes. To handle disputes, Bisq features a decentralized and open arbitrator system. Bisq is now preparing to launch a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and its BSQ token, a colored coin on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nDecentralization and Freedom\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Bisq developer Chris Beams for comments on government attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges, likely attack vectors and the impact of decentralized exchanges. Beams also offered a passionate and forceful defense of individual liberty against government over-interference.\n\u201cThe panic has to set in at some point,\u201d argued Beams. \u201cBut it will do so at different times for different governments, and will produce a range of responses from them when it does. I don\u2019t think China\u2019s recent actions \u2014 whether they\u2019re the product of panic or something more strategic \u2014 will necessarily cascade into similar actions in the U.S. or Europe. Shuttering all exchanges by diktat is the kind of textbook totalitarianism the world has come to expect from China, but a similar attack wouldn\u2019t work as well in the U.S. Even if it would, it would be a blunder for the U.S. to attack Bitcoin with such a blunt instrument. It would be suboptimal, a bad use of available resources. It would strengthen the decentralized exchanges that already exist and it would incentivize the creation of better, even more censorship-resistant ones.\u201d\nAccording to Beams, the U.S. in particular has much more effective tools at its disposal, especially Know Your Customer (KYC). The U.S. government forces nearly every centralized exchange, on day one of operation, to collect personal identity information about their users and to correlate trading activity with those identities. \nBeams explained that U.S. corporations tend to take compliance seriously and actually do cooperate with these rules, meaning that U.S. regulatory agencies have, in principle at least, access to enough information to de-anonymize a large and growing percentage of all Bitcoin transactions. And plausible traceability of transactions is all they need to keep the threat of tax collection in force.\n\u201cIf I were the U.S., I\u2019d be ushering new Bitcoiners through the Coinbase cattle gate just as fast as they can be prodded,\u201d said Beams. \u201cIf I were the U.S., I would have long since concluded there\u2019s nothing fundamental I can do to stop Bitcoin itself, so if I can\u2019t beat \u2019em, I\u2019ll at least make sure I can continue to tax \u2019em.\u201d\nThe recent John Doe summons delivered to Coinbase by the IRS shows that KYC is the attack vector of choice for the U.S., which could result in billions in taxes reported by people who fear that their Bitcoin activity can be audited. KYC appears to be a much more effective long-term attack vector than heavy-handed shutdown orders.\n\u201cSo yes, by all means, let\u2019s bring on the decentralized exchanges,\u201d said Beams. \u201cBut they\u2019d better be really and truly decentralized because if a government can stop them, they will \u2014 at least once they get big enough to become worth the effort. The attack vector with decentralized exchanges won\u2019t be KYC, though, because any decentralized exchange that implements KYC will instantly be abandoned by its users.\u201d\nThe attack vector for decentralized exchanges, said Beams, will be \u201cthe good ole four horsemen of the infocalypse.\u201d In other words, decentralized exchanges will be vilified as tools for drug dealers, terrorists, pedophiles and money launderers. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the same script every time a government is interested in talking people out of their own freedoms. This attack vector won\u2019t work for the exchanges that have achieved escape velocity levels of decentralization, but it may stop some and will make life difficult for others.\u201d\nBeams suggested that the only way to really stop decentralized crypto-fiat exchanges would be to outlaw Bitcoin trading altogether. \u201cThis would force people to think twice about every trade, and to consider whether their counterparty might be an agent, which would result in a profound chilling effect.\u201d\nHowever, he thinks that this sort of heavy-handed attack seems unlikely to be attempted in the U.S. or Europe because there are just too many vested interests in Bitcoin now. It\u2019s more likely that the authorities will continue to insist on KYC, tolerate compliant centralized exchanges and demonize the decentralized ones.\n\u201cWith all that having been said, I\u2019m actually optimistic,\u201d concluded Beams. \u201cAttacks by state actors \u2014 real and threatened \u2014 are making every part of this ecosystem stronger. Bitcoin has proven itself anti-fragile as hell thus far, and by the time all the battles have been waged, what will emerge on the other side are alternatives to existing financial institutions \u2014 money, banks, exchanges and all the rest \u2014 that are actually better in every way than their traditional counterparts. \n\n\u201cWe are being forced by the threat of state violence to design crypto-economic systems with the highest degrees of security, privacy and censorship resistance baked in from the protocol level up. That very pressure is what is propelling these solutions forward, I think, into a bright future of genuine financial freedom for people. I wouldn\u2019t be working on this stuff if I thought otherwise.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 28}

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nAngelList,\u00a0the job board specializing in startup jobs, reports cryptocurrency job postings have nearly doubled in the past six months and are soon to triple from 2016. Companies in the crypto space have experienced \u201cunparalleled investment and growth\u201d in recent months. The organization stated that while many new technologies (self-driving cars and virtual reality, for example) are embraced by tech giants, cryptocurrency remains one of the largest non-corporate startup opportunities.The data shows that investments are on the rise. Cryptocurrency startups collected more investments in the first two quarters of 2017 ($467 million) than they did in all of 2016 ($325 million). According to AngelList, as the companies in the crypto space grow, and raise larger amounts of funds at higher valuations, their need for new talent has also grown. The two main reasons for the crypto hiring boom are the expansions of both Bitcoin and Ethereum to a mainstream audience and the popularity of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).In 2016, there were 442 cryptocurrency-related job postings on AngelList; however, the number of listings is projected to reach 1,255 by the end of 2017. The organization added that in the last six months, the number of job postings has nearly doubled. While experienced engineers in the crypto space are in the highest demand, startups are also looking for engineers with an interest in cryptocurrencies. There are also positions ready to be filled in the areas of marketing, business development, operations, customer support and other job functions in which no technical background is required.The main reasons to join a cryptocurrency startup as either an employee or a team member include better salaries \u2014 up to 20 percent higher compared to the industry norm \u2014 more remote flexibility and employee liquidity in the form of tokens or coins, which is often an exclusive bonus offered at \u201cnew coin/token companies,\u201d according to AngelList.Preparing to Answer the Growing Demand for TalentAt a time when demand for crypto experts is on the rise, the blockchain and research development company IOHK has announced that the first cohort of its graduates has successfully completed training at the summer course hosted by IOHK, and are ready to start working within the crypto space and blockchain industry. IOHK plans to offer full-time positions to selected candidates from the training program in the firm\u2019s newly created Athens Haskell Team.IOHK offered the summer course free of charge to computer science graduates in Athens, Greece. The participants were personally selected by the university professors. The course primarily focused on Haskell, a programming language currently in high demand within the crypto space because of the language\u2019s significant security advantages. The summer course was a little more than two months long, hosted between July 17 and September 22.\u201cCorporations and financial institutions are increasingly seeking Haskell developers, but are faced with a shortage of skilled programmers. IOHK is delighted to have trained seven talented students into proficient Haskell developers. Building on IOHK\u2019s growing legacy of sourcing and training high-quality programmers and engineers from Greece, we are proud to have made several offers of employment to them,\u201d IOHK Chief Scientist Aggelos Kiayias said in a statement.In addition to attending lectures presented by notables like Dr. Lars Br\u00fcnjes, Haskell developer at IOHK, and Dr. Andres L\u00f6h of the Haskell consulting firm Well-Typed, the students had to complete assignments and programming projects, such as creating peer-to-peer networks and performing a \u201chandshake\u201d with a Bitcoin node. \u201cBy integrating several of IOHK\u2019s internal project goals into the curriculum, students were given practical experience programming code that solved real, relevant industry problems,\u201d Prof. Kiayias said.IOHK is not the only firm offering blockchain courses for students. Blockchain software technology company ConsenSys recently announced that the first developer program class of ConsenSys Academy, consisting of more than 150 blockchain developers, will be flying to Dubai for a \u201cthree-day hackathon\u201d followed by a graduate ceremony on October 22, 2017.

{"title": "IOHK Launches Cardano Blockchain; Ada Now Trading on Bittrex", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/iohk-launches-cardano-blockchain-ada-now-trading-bittrex/", "birthday": "Oct 2, 2017  9:06 AM EST", "date": "2017-10-02 14:06:00", "content": "Amy Castor is a full-time freelance writer and researcher who enthusiastically follows Bitcoin and Ethereum. She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nSo far, Ethereum has been the lead player in the smart contract platform space. Now a new competitor is steadily creeping into the game. And, in an interesting twist, the effort is being led by a former Ethereum CEO.Last week, blockchain development firm IOHK, led by Charles Hoskinson, launched Cardano, a new blockchain. And yesterday, Ada (ADA), the platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency, began trading on the U.S.-regulated exchange Bittrex. The 10,000 Ada voucher holders who participated in the earlier crowdsale can now download the Cardano wallet Daedalus and use that to redeem their Ada tokens and begin trading. Westerners, who were omitted from the crowdsale, which was focused mainly in Japan, now have a chance to purchase those tokens via Bittrex. If all goes according to IOHK\u2019s plans, these events will mark the beginning of a two-year process that will see Cardano evolve into a full-fledged smart contract platform with an impressive library of protocols that developers can use to build their decentralized apps. \u00a0How It All Began Hoskinson was an an early founder of Ethereum. He left the project before the network launched and eventually went on to form IOHK with colleague Jeremy Wood in 2014. \u00a0The following year, IOHK was approached by a group of Japanese business people interested in creating a blockchain that would function as a cryptocurrency and a smart contract platform while meeting the needs for the increasing regulatory oversight in the blockchain space. To raise funds for the development, the group wanted to do an initial coin offering (ICO) focused on Asian markets. \u201cThey said it would be really nice to do a large-scale distribution in Asia, as opposed to the Western world, which is already saturated with cryptocurrencies,\u201d Hoskinson said, in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. So the group hired IOHK to build software to assist with compliance during the sale. The Japanese company Attain was enlisted to coordinate the sale, and another entity, Cardano Foundation, handled oversight and auditing. Meanwhile, the crowdsale, which ran from September 2015 to January 2017, raised $62 million and resulted in the sale of roughly 30 billion Ada vouchers. (Only 45 billion Ada will ever be in circulation.) Because none of those vouchers were sold to U.S. citizens, the sale did not fall under the umbrella of the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission rules. \u201cThere was some regulatory advantages to offshoring it,\u201d said Hoskinson. \u201cAnd there were also some cultural advantages; mainly we had a blue sky, wide-open marketplace.\u201d The Japanese group, which has come to be called Emurgo, also hired IOHK to build Cardano under a five-year contract that will end in 2020. Emurgo will become to Cardano what ConsenSys is to Ethereum: a studio for designing smart contracts and decentralized apps that will run on the platform.Haskell-BasedSo what is Cardano exactly? It is a full blockchain, built from scratch in the functional programming language Haskell. IOHK hired Philip Wadler, a principal designer of the Haskell language to work on the Cardano project.According to Hoskinson, because Haskell is similar to math in its approach, code can be written more precisely, resulting in a more secure and reliable protocol. At the heart of Cardano lies Ouroboros, a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. While Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies rely on proof of work, where miners solve a cryptographic puzzle to reach consensus on the state of the ledger, proof-of-stake systems reach consensus by coin-holder vote. As a result, proof of stake is vastly more energy efficient than proof of work. It also enables faster transactions and opens the door to governance schemes, where coin holders can have a say in how the protocol evolves. Yet, developing a secure proof of stake is exceedingly difficult. To that end, Ouroboros comes with a mathematical proof of security which has gone through a rigorous peer review, resulting in its acceptance and presentation at Crypto 2017, a major cryptography conference. Several other projects are also working on proof-of-stake algorithms, including Ethereum (Casper), Algorand and Snow White. Byron and ShelleyIn terms of Cardano, what is live now is the first major release of the platform dubbed \u201cByron.\u201d This is the first generation of the settlement layer, which is where Ada lives. Some functionality is not yet switched on, however, because the platform is currently in bootstrap mode. The system will need a broader distribution of coin holders before it is up and running in full form. So, at this early stage, even though Ouroboros is turned on, consensus is locked to private nodes until the system gathers momentum, and that may take another four to six months, said Hoskinson. \u00a0Following Byron, the next major release of Cardano, dubbed \u201cShelley,\u201d is scheduled to arrive in the first half of 2018. During the Shelley phase, the system will evolve into a full-featured, independent cryptocurrency. \u201cIf I died and IOHK shut down, Cardano could run forever in that form,\u201d said Hoskinson. \u00a0Equally important, Shelley will prepare Cardano for a range of impressive features, including smart contracts, side chains, multi-party computation, metadata and more. Those protocols will be added gradually over time. \u201cWe will just keep putting them in when they become available,\u201d said Hoskinson, adding that most of those features will debut next year.He expects to launch a trusted hardware feature, which will allow for off-chain payments, in 2019. \u00a0Smart ContractsIOHK is currently developing its own virtual machine (VM), akin to Ethereum\u2019s EVM. This will become the computation layer of the platform, where self-executing code will live. Hoskinson said he expects the Cardano VM to be available sometime in the first half of next year.Along with that, Cardano will have its own smart contract language called Plutus, a lightweight version of Haskell. Plutus is intended for high-assurance contracts where a security breach could have devastating consequences. Eventually, new capabilities will allow users to write decentralized apps in legacy languages like Java, C and JavaScript. \u201cYou have to be pragmatic,\u201d said Hoskinson. \u201cPeople are not always going want to write high-assurance code.\u201dAlso in the works are plans for a governance system in which decisions about the future of the protocol are made on-chain, and a treasury system in which a portion of the transaction fees are retained for future development.Overall, Hoskinson made it clear that this is to be a slow and steady launch, with the goal of creating a secure, reliable platform that will span decades. \u201cCardano is a rigorous, systematic project,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a lot of principles behind it.\u201d For more details on Cardano, check out Why Cardano?, Cardano Settlement Layer Documentation, Cardano Monetary Policy and the project\u2019s GitHub code.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nCome November, the remaining signatories of the \u201cNew York Agreement\u201d (NYA) plan to deploy the \u201cSegWit2X\u201d hard fork to double Bitcoin\u2019s block weight limit, allowing for up to 8 megabytes of block space. Since not everyone supports this hard fork, this could well \u201csplit\u201d the Bitcoin network into two incompatible blockchains and currencies, not unlike Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (Bcash) did two months ago.\nBut this NYA hard fork is controversial and not only because it lacks consensus. It\u2019s also controversial because of design choices made by the development team behind BTC1, the software client associated with the New York Agreement. Perhaps most importantly, this development team, led by Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik, has so far refused to implement replay protection, a measure that Bcash did take. Partly for this reason, at least one NYA signatory \u2014 Wayniloans \u2014 has backed out of the agreement.\nSo what is replay protection, why should BTC1 implement it \u2026 and why doesn\u2019t it?\nWhat Is Replay Protection? (And What Are Replay Attacks?)\nBitcoin could see another \u201csplit\u201d by November. (It\u2019s arguably more accurate to consider the \u201csplitting\u201d nodes and miners as an entirely new cryptocurrency with a new blockchain and token \u2014 not an actual split of Bitcoin itself.) For the purpose of this article, we\u2019ll refer to the blockchain and currency that follows the current Bitcoin protocol as \u201cLegacy Bitcoin\u201d and \u201cBTC.\u201d The blockchain and currency that follows the New York Agreement hard fork is referred to as \u201cSegWit2X\u201d and \u201cB2X.\u201d\nIf this split happens, the two blockchains will be identical. All past transactions and (therefore) \u201cbalances\u201d are copied from the Legacy Bitcoin blockchain onto the SegWit2X blockchain. Everyone who owns BTC will own a corresponding amount of B2X.\nWithout replay protection, new transactions will be equally valid on both chains as well. This means that these transactions can be copied or \u201creplayed,\u201d from one chain to the other \u2014 in other words, for them to happen on both. This is called a \u201creplay attack.\u201d\nSo, let\u2019s say Alice holds BTC at the time of split, which means she also owns B2X after the split. Then, after the split, she wants to send BTC to Bob. So, she creates a transaction that spends BTC from one of her Legacy Bitcoin addresses to one of Bob\u2019s Legacy Bitcoin addresses. She then transmits this transaction over the Legacy Bitcoin network for a Legacy Bitcoin miner to pick it up and include in a Legacy Bitcoin block. The payment is confirmed; all is good.\nBut this very same transaction is perfectly valid on the SegWit2X blockchain. Anyone \u2014 including Bob \u2014 can take Alice's Legacy Bitcoin transaction and also transmit it over the SegWit2X network for a miner to include in a SegWit2X block. (This can even happen by accident quite easily.) If this payment is also confirmed, Alice has inadvertently sent Bob not only BTC but also an equal amount of B2X.\nAnd, of course, all of this is true in reverse as well. If Alice sends B2X to Bob, she might accidentally send him BTC as well. A lack of replay protection, therefore, is a problem for users of both chains. No one wants to accidentally send any money \u2014 not even if it was \u201cfree money.\u201d\nTechnically, there are ways to \u201csplit\u201d coins on both chains to ensure they can only be spent on one chain. This would, for example, require newly mined coins to be mixed into a transaction. Tiime-locks can also offer solutions. But this takes effort and is not easy, especially for average users \u2014 not to mention that many average users may not even know what\u2019s going on in the first place.\nTo avoid this kind of hassle, at least one side of the split could add a protocol rule to ensure that new transactions are valid on one chain but not the other. This is called replay protection.\nWhy Should BTC1 Implement Replay Protection? (And Why Not Bitcoin Core?)\nIn case of a split, at least one side must implement replay protection. But many \u2014 Bitcoin Core developers and others \u2014 believe there\u2019s only one viable option. It\u2019s the splitting party \u2014 in this case BTC1 \u2014 that should do it.\nThere are several arguments for this.\nFirst of all, it makes the most sense for BTC1 to implement replay protection because that requires the least effort. BTC1 is a new client that\u2019s already implementing new protocol rules anyway, and it\u2019s not very widely deployed yet. It would be relatively easy for BTC1 to include replay protection.\nMeanwhile, it would not be sufficient for Bitcoin Core to implement replay protection on its own. While it is dominant, and even considered by some to be the protocol-defining reference implementation, Bitcoin Core is not the only Bitcoin implementation on the network. Bitcoin Knots, Bcoin, Libbitcoin and other alternative clients would all have to implement replay protection, too. (And that\u2019s not even taking non-full node clients into account.)\nBut even more importantly, the reality of the current situation is that all deployed Bitcoin nodes do not have replay protection implemented. And logically, they can\u2019t: Some of these nodes even predate the New York Agreement. So even if Bitcoin Core and other implementations were to implement replay protection in new releases of their software, it wouldn\u2019t suffice. All users must then also update to this new version within about two months: a very short period of time for a network-wide upgrade.\nIf only some of the nodes on the network upgrade to these new releases, Bitcoin could actually split in three: Legacy Bitcoin, SegWit2X and \u201cReplay Protected Bitcoin.\u201d Needless to say, this three-way split would probably make the problem worse \u2014 not better.\nLastly, there is a bit of a philosophical argument. Anyone who wants to adopt new protocol rules, so the argument goes, has the responsibility to split off as safely as possible. This responsibility should not fall on those who want to keep using the existing protocol: They should be free to keep using the \u00a0protocol as-is.\nMany developers \u2014 including RSK founder Sergio Lerner who drafted the SegWit2Mb proposal on which SegWit2X is based \u2014 have argued that BTC1 should implement replay protection. In fact, many developers think that any hard fork, even a hard fork that appears entirely uncontroversial, should implement replay protection.\nBut so far, the BTC1 development team will only consider optional replay protection.\nWhat\u2019s Wrong With Optional Replay Protection?\nImplementing optional replay protection, as proposed by former Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen, for example, is currently on the table for BTC1.\nIn short, this type of optional replay protection would make certain specially crafted (\u201cOP_RETURN\u201d) Legacy Bitcoin transactions invalid on the SegWit2X chain. Anyone who\u2019d want to split their coins could spend their BTC with such a transaction. These transactions should then confirm on the Legacy Bitcoin blockchain but not on the SegWit2X chain. This effectively splits the coins into different addresses (\u201coutputs\u201d) on both chains.\nSuch optional replay protection is probably better than nothing at all, but it\u2019s still not a definitive solution.\nOne problem is that the Legacy Bitcoin blockchain would have to include all these OP_RETURN transactions. This would probably result in more transactions on the network and would require extra data for each transaction. All this data must be transmitted, verified and (at least temporarily) stored by all Legacy Bitcoin nodes. It presents a burden to the Legacy Bitcoin network.\nBut more importantly, it would probably still not be very easy to utilize this option. It might suffice for professional users \u2014 exchanges, wallet providers and other service providers \u2014 as well as tech-savvy individual users. But these are generally also the types of users that would be able to split their coins even without replay protection. Average users, if they are even aware of what\u2019s going on, would probably find it much more difficult to utilize optional replay protection.\nOptional replay protection, therefore, offers help to those who need it least and does little for those who need it most.\nDoes the NYA Preclude Replay Protection?\nWhile it\u2019s unclear what was (or is) discussed behind closed doors, the New York Agreement seems to be a very minimal agreement. Published on May 23, 2017, it really only consists of two concrete points:\nActivate Segregated Witness at an 80 percent threshold, signaling at bit 4, and\nActivate a 2 MB hard fork within six months.\nWith the first point completed through BIP91, the only remaining point is a hard fork to 2 megabytes before November 23. (This assumes that this hard fork wasn\u2019t completed with the creation of Bitcoin Cash which is supported by a number of NYA signatories.)\nNotably, a lot of details are not filled in. For example, the agreement does not even state that signatories must specifically run the BTC1 software: Any software implementation that implements a hard fork to 2 megabytes might do. This could even include a software implementation that implements replay protection. And, of course, nothing in the NYA stops BTC1 from implementing replay protection; some signatories may have even expected it.\nWhy Won\u2019t BTC1 Implement Replay Protection?\nThere are really several reasons why BTC1 \u2014 both stated and speculated \u2014 might not want to add replay protection.\nThe first reason is that replay protection would require simplified payment verification (SPV) wallets and some other thin clients to upgrade in order to send and receive transactions on SegWit2X. Replay protection would, therefore, in the words of BTC1 developer Jeff Garzik, \u201cbreak\u201d SPV wallets; they wouldn\u2019t be compatible with SegWit2X until upgraded.\nThis framing and choice of words is disputed. If SegWit2X were to implement replay protection (and if SPV wallets don\u2019t upgrade), these wallets could still send and receive transactions on Legacy Bitcoin perfectly fine. On top of that, they wouldn\u2019t accidentally spend B2X when they don\u2019t mean to.\nMeanwhile, if the SegWit2X chain does not implement replay protection (and if SPV-wallets don\u2019t upgrade), users may not be sure if their wallet is receiving or sending BTC transactions or B2X transactions or both. They also may not be sure if the balance in their wallet is a BTC balance or a B2X balance or both. And if hash power moves from one chain to another over time, these wallets could even switch from displaying BTC balances to B2X balances or the other way round without users knowing. (This problem could be solved, to some extent, through another workaround, but this is not yet implemented in either.)\nIndeed, not implementing replay protection on SegWit2X could arguably \u201cbreak\u201d SPV wallets much worse.\nThe only (plausible) scenario where implementing replay protection would perhaps not break SPV wallets much worse is if there is no Legacy Bitcoin to speak of. Indeed, the New York Agreement very specifically intends to \u201cupgrade\u201d Bitcoin, rather than split off into a new coin as Bcash did. And based on miner signaling and statements of intent by several big Bitcoin companies, some NYA signatories claim that Legacy Bitcoin will not be able to survive at all.\nImplementing replay protection is, therefore, sometimes considered an admission that SegWit2X will split off from (Legacy) Bitcoin into something new and will not be considered the upgraded version of Bitcoin.\nBut the assumption that Legacy Bitcoin won\u2019t be able survive is a big one. In reality, miner signaling is effectively meaningless, while Bitcoin Core \u2014 the dominant Bitcoin implementation \u2014 will not adopt the hard fork. There is also a significant list of companies that have not stated that they support the hard fork, including two top-10 mining pools. Similarly, it\u2019s not clear if many (individual) users will support SegWit2X either. The implementation of wipe-out protection (another safety measure) also suggests that even BTC1 developers aren\u2019t so sure that there will only be one chain.\nAnd perhaps even more importantly, it\u2019s not clear that replay protection would affect any of this. If miners, developers, companies and users are to consider SegWit2X an upgrade of Bitcoin, they will probably do so with or without replay protection.\nThis is why it has also been suggested that BTC1 is rejecting replay protection for the specific purpose of being as disruptive as possible. If the Legacy Bitcoin chain is effectively made unusable, SegWit2X might stand the best chance of being recognized as \u201cBitcoin.\u201d\nFor more information and debate on replay protection, also see the the relevant threads on the SegWit2X mailing list.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 22}

Readers who don\u2019t know what Second Life is are excused because it\u2019s not on the media\u2019s radar these days. But 10 years ago Second Life was often hailed as the Next Big Thing in social media.\nIn Second Life, players can create an avatar and explore a huge 3D virtual world created by the users themselves. The expectation was that the \u201cMetaverse\u201d imagined by science fiction writer Neal Stephenson in his cult novel Snow Crash\u00a0(1992) would soon materialize and billions of users would flock to Second Life.\nTherefore, a strong presence on Second Life would be a strategic need for all sorts of businesses and organizations, from online retailers and advertisers to universities and government agencies. This perception created a thriving Second Life development and consulting sector, and some companies (this writer owned one) made good money for a couple of years.\nThen, Second Life faded into oblivion, sort of. In hindsight, the problem was that Second Life isn\u2019t immersive enough (users don\u2019t really have the impression of \u201cbeing there\u201d) and it is too difficult to master.\nHigh Fidelity wants to change that by supporting highly immersive Virtual Reality (VR) interfaces, including VR headsets like the Oculus Rift, sensors for hand and body motion, and 3D audio. Rosedale hopes that a fully immersive 3D world, like the OASIS world described in a more recent cult novel (Ernest Cline\u2019s Ready Player One,\u00a02011), will be both more appealing and easier to use than Second Life. For example, if you want to shake another avatar\u2019s hand, you just do it, instead of having to remember a Ctrl-Alt-Something command.\nAnother important difference is that High Fidelity is much less centralized than Second Life, and it allows creators to host independent virtual worlds using their own equipment and infrastructure.\nAs for Second Life, it\u2019s still there and business hasn\u2019t entirely disappeared. While the big corporations and organizations are mostly gone or inactive, there\u2019s a thriving virtual retail market for things like design avatars, virtual clothes, gadgets and prefabs. It\u2019s small business, but some developers earn a living on the Second Life Marketplace. Of course, counterfeited and pirated virtual goods represent a problem.\nSecond Life virtual goods are priced in Linden dollars, a virtual currency fully integrated with the Second Life platform. Introduced long before 2009, the Linden dollar is not a blockchain-based cryptocurrency. \nNow, Rosedale has a cryptocurrency in the works dubbed HFC for the High Fidelity Marketplace and a whole ecosystem including externally-operated servers. Contrary to the Linden dollar, which is only a payment means, the HFC will leverage blockchain technology\u2019s ability to track transactions and ownership.\n\u201cWe are getting ready to deploy blockchain software to create a new currency for virtual worlds, called HFC,\u201d says Rosedale. \u201cIn addition to providing the basis for in-world transactions, the HFC blockchain will also be used to store information about the ownership of digital assets in virtual worlds. We plan to use this aspect of the blockchain to provide an open way to protect intellectual property by embedding certification, affirming item ownership into the blockchain.\u201d \nIn another post, Rosedale provides more details on the intellectual property protection mechanisms envisioned for High Fidelity. \u201cThis system will work across an open network of many different servers, does not need to use ineffective DRM systems, and is not dependent on or controlled by any central agency (other than the initial first registration of unique assets),\u201d he explains.\nAccording to High Fidelity, the open, permissionless nature of the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains cause limited throughput (transactions per second) and high transaction fees, which makes them unsuitable for HFC. Therefore, Rosedale\u2019s team is developing a public but \u201cpermissioned\u201d blockchain, where only a subset of trusted participants can verify transactions. It could be argued, however, that High Fidelity is being too quick in dismissing new scaling solutions that could lead to higher throughput and lower fees in the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.\nRosedale notes that the Linden dollar, not based on a blockchain, shows remarkable stability in price, with much less volatility than blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. High Fidelity plans to achieve a similar stability \u201cthrough active management [\u2026] voting, smart contracts and other mechanisms to regulate the monetary policy.\u201d\nThe High Fidelity community is encouraged to provide feedback on HFC. \u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing and getting feedback on these designs in our ongoing community meetings in High Fidelity,\u201d says Rosedale. \nMore information is available on related discussion threads in the High Fidelity Forums.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 7}

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nConsenSys, an Ethereum production studio based in Brooklyn, NY, is launching a $50 million venture arm, and it has picked Kavita Gupta to run it. Gupta\u2019s job will be to oversee the new venture and help structure deals with the startups.\nIt is not uncommon for companies with investment capital to form their own investment arm. For the most part, the goal is to fund startups that could drive value for the parent company down the line. And, as a strategic investor, ConsenSys Ventures will be actively involved in developing startups from an early stage.\nBitcoin Magazine spoke with Gupta on the phone earlier this week. She was in New York getting ready to dash off to San Francisco. ConsenSys has offices in Brooklyn and in San Francisco, and Gupta will be splitting her time between both of those offices.\nShe explained she will be working closely with Joseph Lubin, the founder of ConsenSys and one of the early founders of Ethereum. And, she added, naturally, ConsenSys Ventures will be looking to invest in Ethereum-based startups.\n\u201cWe are looking at companies already, and we are going to deploy this as soon as we get green signals from a lawyer on the structure. Everything else is place,\u201d said Gupta, who will be talking more about the fund at Women in STEM in San Francisco on Monday.\nWhen asked about the overall goals of the venture, she responded, \u201cI think, to Joe, being one of the co-founders of Ethereum, what really matters is how to basically accelerate this revolution. He wants the smartest entrepreneurs to create applications on it, to use it and start ingraining that work into our ecosystem to create companies.\u201d\nTo that end, ConsenSys Ventures will be looking to invest in pre-seed, seed, and equity stage companies, she explained, adding that the fund will also be investing in pre-token sales, if the entrepreneurs decide to go the initial coin offering (ICOs) route.\nGupta described her role as overseeing the entire process while also being deeply involved with structuring deals. \u201cLike any managing partner, I will be basically doing due diligence, looking at the companies, and structuring the deal. And, at the same time, making sure all the fiduciary duties are done,\u201d she said. \u201cWith respect to making the decisions, it is going to be me and Joe working very closely.\u201d\nShe indicated, finding good startups to invest in would not be an issue. \u201cOnce you are in ConsenSys, which is pretty much the center of the blockchain space, you don\u2019t really have to go out looking for great companies,\u201d she said, adding that the team was currently \u201clooking deeply\u201d at four to five startups, but nothing had been finalized yet.\nShe said she will leave the decision as to whether or not a startup should launch an ICO, up to the entrepreneurs themselves. \u201cWe help them create a business. We help them create an idea. I don\u2019t think we are really pushing or saying that every company has to go for token sales. It makes sense for some companies, and for others, it doesn\u2019t make sense. We want to support the entrepreneurs in whatever they do.\u201d\n \nStrategic funding is different than straight venture capital funding, she emphasized. \u201cWe want to believe that it is different than the traditional investment because it is sort of like a VC hedge fund. All of the companies are coming to you at a very early stage, and we want to be involved in shaping the company, with respect to business, operations, hiring, and how they are going to make money.\u201d\nAs part of that, the ConsenSys Ventures will offer a range of support. \u201cWe also work as a strategic investor, helping you out both with respect to the technology solutions, because we have access to the ConsenSys ecosystem, and also to deliver the company, because a lot of people forget they have to deliver the company after that.\u201d\nShe also pointed out that ConsenSys Ventures was part of a natural evolution. Two years ago, ConsenSys launched as a way to build out ideas on top of the Ethereum network. Earlier this year, ConsenSys launched ConsenSys Academy to start training engineers in how to do that work on their own. Now, ConsenSys Ventures is sort of a middle ground, offering support, but still letting entrepreneurs do their own thing.\n\u201cNow across the world, entrepreneurs are capable of building and designing \u2014 coding their own systems on Ethereum. They don\u2019t necessarily need ConsenSys 100 percent, so how do we collaborate with them? I think Consensys Ventures is the best way to do it.\u201d\n \nA native of India, Gupta is a 2015 recipient of the U.N. Social Finance Innovator Award.

{"title": "Op Ed: China's ICO Ban Is Characteristic \u2014 Not Catastrophic", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-chinas-ico-ban-characteristic-not-catastrophic/", "birthday": "Sep 8, 2017 2:47 PM EST", "date": "2017-09-08 19:47:00", "content": "The crypto market, especially in China, has been in a panic in these past few days, largely because of an official notice on Preventing Risks of Fundraising Through Coin Offering, jointly issued by the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC), the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.\nThere seems to be a general fear that China\u2019s attack on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and tokens, often used to fund blockchain innovation and open up investment in blockchain technology to the masses, will stifle blockchain development and the industry as a whole in one of the world\u2019s largest markets.\nAt first glance, the harshness of the statement seems to be comparable to the Chinese government\u2019s 2013 warning that made bitcoin prices plummet immediately. However, those in the West who suspect that China is stifling Chinese innovation are underestimating the political wisdom of the Chinese government. Meanwhile, those in East critcizing China\u2019s ICO policy for being too harsh as the government moves to protect the interests of private investors are ignoring the Chinese government\u2019s history of decisiveness in tackling \u201cillegal public funding\u201d in recent decades. \nWestern critics should think about China\u2019s economic development and gains during the past decades since a policy of openness was initiated in 1978; in this context, the government\u2019s latest statment can be read for its underlying message. Eastern critics should understand that the Chinese government has zero tolerance for any activities that will jeopardize its financial stability.\nThe second-largest economy in the world managed to weather the financial crises of both 1997 and 2008: This was not simply chance. China\u2019s economy is both innovative and ambitious. Since blockchain technology is acknowledged as the next-generation technological powerhouse, with the potential to reshape the way value is exchanged, there is no reason for China to do anything to harm blockchain innovation. China is not cracking down on blockchain technology: It is actually poised to lead blockchain development not only in its own country, but also around the world.\nBreaking Down the Language\nFirst, though the original text is subtle, it is crucial to note that PBOC\u2019s statement on September 4 only targets illegal ICOs instead of targeting blockchain companies as a whole. The translation of original text is: \u201cNo organizations or individuals shall conduct any illegal token financing activities (ICO).\u201d The underlying interpretation is that where there are illegal ICOs, there will also be legal ICOs (or \u201ctoken financing atctivities\u201d), which requires the introduction of new regulations.\nBesides avoiding the use of the word \u201cblockchain\u201d itself, the statement also reveals another subtlety: It uses the term \u201cvirtual currencies\u201d to refer to all ICO tokens. This word choice is particularly telling. In the past, when People\u2019s Daily, the party-run newspaper, described bitcoin as \u201cdigital gold\u201d \u2015 for instance, in an article published in May \u2015 it used the term \u201cdigital currency.\u201d It is important to interpret the Chinese language, especially specific word choices made by official sources, very carefully. By choosing to use the word \u201cvirtual,\u201d a word implying \u201cunreal\u201d and \u201cinsubstantial\u201d in Chinese, the legitimacy of ICO tokens has already been undermined. \nSecond, what happened in the Chinese crypto market in the past few months has impacted the government\u2019s bottom line: Its financial stability has been threatened. Although many Westerners in the crypto space are familiar with a few Chinese projects like NEO and Qtum, the Chinese crypto market has actually witnessed the recent advent of more than 65 ICO projects, with around $400 million raised, according to a report issued by National Committee of Experts on Internet Financial Security Technology. \u00a0\nThe absolute number is not enormous, but the key is that most of these projects are unreliable and even fraudulent, with no open-source codes and sometimes without any white paper. Some projects even provide huge discounts to pre-ICO investors \u2015 thereby dooming those who joined the official ICO to lose money, even after building up hopes of 10x returns. It is this sort of irresponsible behavior that compelled the government to step in before anything more extreme happened.\nFurthermore, any financial activities involving financing from the public are particularly suspect in the eyes of the Chinese government. Wu Ying, once China\u2019s most successful businesswoman, was sentenced to life in prison in 2014 for \u201cillegal funding from the public.\u201d Also, E Zubao, once the country\u2019s biggest online lender, was condemned by Chinese authorities as a Ponzi scheme after the company was found to have squandered the money raised from the public (which should have been used to match investors to potential borrowers). The losses can be considerable: Around $7.6 billion was involved in the E Zubao case, for instance. \nPast transgressions like these are chiefly to blame for China\u2019s current suspicion of ICOs. It is perhaps no surprise, in other words, that the government is declaring ICOs to be illegal, while requiring the return of all tokens to investors. China is being characteristically cautious regarding anything posing potential risks to its financial stability.\nThird, while China still encourages innovation within the blockchain industry, it needs a regulated crypto market. It may regulate ICOs, the exchanges, and information disclosure channels. But the reason behind this regulation stems from a need to create a sound environment for blockchain development in China. \nAccording to China\u2019s Premier Li Qeqiang last year \u2015 in the government\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development \u2015 blockchain technology has been listed as an important area of development for Chinese endeavors. This overtly positive support of blockchain technology will not be changed easily. Other evidence of official support of blockchain technology abounds. For instance, a news program on CCTV stated that China is only pausing ICOs, not banning them outright. And the news section of the official site of the Chinese government also reposted an article stating that \u201cChina can potentially become the leader in blockchain industry.\u201d (See image below.) These are all subtle signals that China is preparing for a better blockchain world. \nIn the blockchain session of the Global Digital Marketing Summit, held by the Guiyang government in western China in July this year, the government also mentioned that a \u201csandbox mechanism\u201d will become an important step for investors to invest in projects without worrying about policy risk (as the sandbox will allow for a more open space for qualified projects to be promoted and financed). \u00a0\n\nAn article on the official website of the Chinese government: China can potentially become the leader in blockchain industry\nICOs are among the first experiments for the blockchain industry to explore its own business and financing models. It is normal that a new industry and its encumbent business model will find itself in conflict with the existing laws of a given country at some point. To make some corrections and to embrace compliance guidelines will not harm the industry in the long run.\nChina\u2019s attitude toward blockchains and ICOs has had such an impact on the global token price that it has actually affirmed the importance of China\u2019s role in the industry. Its recent policy is an attempt to maintain financial stability and set the tone for the future of the industry in China.\nFears that China will confine or even kill the blockchain industry are not tenable. Furthermore, China has a large and solid foundation of internet and mobile device users, and a world-class level of infrastructure.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nGreenAddress (and its reimplementation GreenBits), the Bitcoin wallet that was acquired by blockchain infrastructure company Blockstream last year, is the first mobile wallet to offer Segregated Witness (SegWit) transactions. This means that GreenAddress users are among the first to benefit from lower fees and faster transaction times enabled by the long-awaited protocol upgrade.\n\u201cThe Bitcoin network is currently not being spammed, so transactions with low fees are getting confirmed \u2014 however, with SegWit the required fees are even lower; they\u2019re almost cut in half,\u201d GreenAddress developer Lawrence Nahum told Bitcoin Magazine.\nOnce upgraded, all new addresses generated by the GreenAddress wallet will be SegWit addresses (though wrapped in a P2SH address, so they still look the same as before). Receiving payments on these addresses does not differ from typical addresses in any way, nor does spending bitcoins from different addresses. But when users spend the bitcoins from the SegWit addresses later on, the protocol upgrade is utilized. This outgoing transaction that requires lower fees will be included in a block more quickly.\nGreenAddress is not the first wallet to enable SegWit: hardware wallets Ledger and Trezor introduced the new feature last week. But in both cases, of course, using the new feature requires owning such hardware devices. GreenAddress, on the other hand, is available to anyone with a smartphone or a computer; if the fees on competing wallets are too high, users can easily switch to GreenAddress.\n\u201cWe are now the first mobile wallet to implement the solution, but I feel the ecosystem, unlike with previous soft fork upgrades, is moving really fast,\u201d Nahum said. \u201cHardware wallets are leading, Armory also has support, Bitcoin Core will have it in the 0.15.1 release, and I'm sure the others will move fast as they have strong incentives: In GreenAddress transaction fees are pretty much halved.\u201d\nInterestingly, the malleability fix that Segregated Witness provides will be utilized by GreenAddress as well. Due to malleability \u2014 the ability to change the appearance of unconfirmed transactions \u2014 spending bitcoins from unconfirmed transactions could fail due to meddling of third parties. While this will not lead to a loss of funds, it could make for a bad user experience, which is why it wasn\u2019t available to most users. With the malleability fix, this issue will now be resolved, and GreenAddress users can re-spend unconfirmed bitcoin balances straight away.\n\nOver the years, GreenAddress has made a name itself by pioneering new features enabled by Bitcoin protocol upgrades. The wallet was, for example, the first to offer opt-in replace-by-fee, which allows users to bump the fee of an outgoing transaction. It was also among the first wallets to offer modern multisig addresses, the first wallet to include fee estimation instead of static fees, the first mobile wallet to support hardware wallets, and more.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 6}

During the consolidation pattern, the price climbed $400 on decreasing volume before ultimately dropping back to $4200. So, where does this leave us and what can we expect in the coming days in the BTC-USD markets?\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 1-Hour Candles, GDAX, Bear Retracement Values\nA common continuation pattern during bear markets is a step-by-step series of tests along the Fibonacci Retracement set. One by one, the Fibonacci values are tested before the retracement ultimately tops out around 61%. During the climb to 61%, a bearish continuation is supported by a decreasing volume trend. In the figure above, we can see the BTC-USD market managed to retrace up to the 61% values before dropping to the 0% retracement values in the $4200s. The drop to test the $4200s was sudden and violent: It took place over a few short hours, and the volume propelling the drop was massive.\nFigure 2: \u00a0BTC-USD, 6-Hour Candles, GDAX, Macro Bear Flag\nPrior to the breakout, the BTC-USD market spent a week forming a bearish continuation pattern called a Bear Flag (the details regarding a Bear Flag was discussed earlier in this week\u2019s ETH-USD article). The price target of this Bear Flag is an approximate $700 move and is projected to touch the $3900s. However, our current price level is sitting right on top of historic support along the macro trend\u2019s 23% Fibonacci Retracement values:Figure 3: BTC-USD, 6-Hour Candles, GDAX, Macro Trend Fibonacci Values\nOur current price level is sitting on an historically significant support level so whether or not we manage to break this support remains to be seen. When trading this pattern, it is important to confirm the movement with volume. When testing historic support or resistance values, it is common to see multiple tests before ultimately breaking through. To date, this represents our third attempt to break this support and it is currently testing it on a volume that is peaking on the 6-hour candle\u2019s volume trend. \nSummary:\n\nFollowing a $700 drop to $4200, BTC-USD managed to climb $400 before ultimately retesting the $4200 support.On the macro bear trend, BTC-USD broke out of a multi-day long Bear Flag. This Bear Flag has a price target of approximately $3900. BTC-USD is currently testing the macro 23% Fibonacci Retracement.

GMO IG\u2019s size and financial muscle, as well as the novel technologies it wants to leverage, will make it a serious entrant in the Bitcoin mining industry, and one that could have a disruptive impact.\n\u201cWe will operate a next-generation mining center utilizing renewable energy and cutting-edge semiconductor chips in Northern Europe,\u201d GMO stated, emphasizing that they will invest in R&D and manufacturing of hardware including the next-generation mining chip. \u201cWe will use cutting-edge 7 nm process technology for chips to be used in the mining process, and jointly work on its research and development and manufacturing with our alliance partner having semiconductor design technology.\u201d\nThe International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors defines 7 nm semiconductor chip technology as the next technology iteration following 10 nm technology, which, in turn, follows the 14-16 nm technology that currently represents the state-of the-art hardware in the Bitcoin mining industry. Commercial production of 7 nm chips is still in the development stage with GlobalFoundries, IBM, Intel, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) competing for market leadership. \nAccording to a recent article in Android Authority, TSMC seems to be in the pole position in this race, having already showcased a preliminary 7 nm SRAM chip \u2014 not yet a full system on a chip (SoC) but an important milestone. Intel is said to be planning the upgrade of a manufacturing plant in Arizona to start building 7 nm SoCs. Samsung and GlobalFoundries are also striving to catch up.\nAccording to Quartz, 7 nm technology would be four times more energy efficient than the current Bitcoin mining industry standard. Therefore, once 7 nm chips are in use, all other miners will have to upgrade to stay in the game.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly the next generation of miners,\u201d Diego Gutierrez, CEO of mining software developer RSK Labs, told Quartz. \u201cThe other [mining chip makers] will surely follow and create their own 7 nm chips if they are not already doing it. As [chip manufacturers] get the new technology, everybody can access it.\u201d\n\u201cWe believe that cryptocurrencies will develop into \u2018new universal currencies\u2019 available for use by anyone from any country or region to freely exchange \u2018value,\u2019 creating a new borderless economic zone,\u201d notes GMO IG. \u201c[Bitcoin] can be regarded as a distributed system whose credibility is secured by mutual monitoring by network participants, as opposed to legal currencies which are a centralized system whose credibility is secured by the issuer. And management of a distributed system such as [Bitcoin] requires a mining process.\u201d\nThe entry in the Bitcoin mining sector of these new Japanese players with relatively deep pockets is likely to be welcomed by those concerned about China\u2019s dominance of the mining industry. For example, Chinese mining operator and hardware manufacturer Bitmain plays a dominant role in the $70 billion Bitcoin economy. Its mining pools, Antpool, BTC.com and ConnectBTC, account for around 30 percent of all the processing power on the global Bitcoin network, while the company is also the market leader for specialized mining hardware, including ASIC chips.\nIn related news, another large Japanese company, DMM, announced the launch of its own Virtual Currency Division, scheduled to begin operation of a virtual currency mining business \u201cDMM Mining Farm\u201d in October 2017. According to the company, which hasn\u2019t released further information, DMM will operate one of the 10 largest mining farms in the world before the end of 2018.\n", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 12}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a safe hard fork,\u201d Electrum lead developer Thomas Voegtlin corrected an audience member at the Breaking Bitcoin conference in Paris last weekend. \u201cI would recommend to have replay protection, of course,\u201d he added.\nCommunity support for SegWit2x, the Bitcoin scaling proposal spearheaded by Barry Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group, was virtually absent in Paris. Whenever the \u201c2x\u201d part of the New York Agreement was discussed in the French capital, speakers and visitors overwhelmingly considered it a risk to defend against \u2014 not a proposal to help succeed.\nElectrum users, for example, will not blindly follow hash power in case of a chain-split, Voegtlin explained throughout his talk; instead, they\u2019ll be able to choose which side of such a split they want to be on. And importantly, the lightweight wallet will implement security measures to prevent users from accidentally spending funds on both chains: \u201creplay protection\u201d that seems unlikely to be implemented on a protocol level if SegWit2x does fork off.\n\u201cWe are ready,\u201d Voegtlin said. \u201cIf [SegWit2x] doesn\u2019t include replay protection, the fork detection we have in Electrum will be useful.\u201d\nBreaking Bitcoin\nInspired by the successful Scaling Bitcoin conference format, the French Bitcoin community hosted the first edition of Breaking Bitcoin two blocks from the Eiffel Tower last weekend. Bitcoin developers, academics and other technical-minded Bitcoiners gathered for a diverse program, but with the common denominator being Bitcoin\u2019s security.\n\u201cFor the past two years, the Bitcoin community has been obsessing with scale and scalability,\u201d Kevin Loaec, managing director at Chainsmiths and co-organizer of the event, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBut I\u2019m not so worried about scale, I\u2019m worried about mining centralization, a lack of privacy and fungibility ... these kinds of things. As an industry we need to recognize there are more challenges than just scalability; hopefully this conference reflects that.\u201d\nWhereas the first Scaling Bitcoin conference two years ago was a very specific reaction to a looming block size limit increase hard fork \u2014 then put forth by Bitcoin XT \u2014 this wasn\u2019t necessarily the motivation behind Breaking Bitcoin. Yet, once again, a controversial hard fork is looming on the horizon. This time imbedded in the BTC1 implementation developed by Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik, the New York Agreement\u2019s SegWit2x is scheduled to increase Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cbase block size limit\u201d to two megabytes by November \u2014 an incompatible protocol change that could split the Bitcoin network in two.\nAnd it did not take much to recognize how unpopular the proposal was in Paris. Perhaps most vividly, Italian Bitcoin startup\u00a0ChainSide\u00a0led a protest campaign by distributing NO2X stickers; the Twitter hashtag was proudly added as a piece of flair to the by now well-known Make Bitcoin Great Again and UASF hats. And voices critical of the project \u2014 like Voegtlin and his call for replay protection \u2014 could consistently count on rounds of applause. From a technical perspective, the proposal is often considered \u2014 quite frankly \u2014 to be reckless.\n\u201cUnfortunately, SegWit2x [\u2026] was designed to effectively be as disruptive to the minority chain,\u201d MyRig engineer and BIP91 author James Hilliard said on stage during the miner panel.\nSegWit2x: The Arguments\nArguments against the 2x hard fork are diverse.\nPerhaps its biggest problem, SegWit2x currently lacks basic safety measures to prevent unsuspecting users from losing funds. This includes, most importantly, the aforementioned replay protection, but a new address format would be similarly helpful.\nAdditionally, the three-month lead time for this specific hard fork is considered extremely short \u2014 assuming the goal is to prevent a chain-split in the first place. \u201cIf you ask any of the developers, they will typically want to see 18 months or two years lead time, for something with as wide an impact on all the software and hardware out there as a hard fork,\u201d Blockstream co-founder and Hashcash inventor Dr. Adam Back noted during a Q&A session.\nAnd if the chain does split into different networks and currencies \u2014 one following the current Bitcoin protocol and one adopting the hard fork \u2014 the question becomes which of the two gets to use the name \u201cBitcoin.\u201d So far, proponents of the SegWit2x hard fork have shown no willingness to pick a new name.\nThis branding issue, Bitcoin Core contributor and Ciphrex co-founder Eric Lombrozo pointed out, provides yet another point of controversy.\n\u201cMy personal opinion is that whomever is proposing the change, the onus is on them to demonstrate widespread support,\u201d Lombrozo said during his talk on protocol changes. \u201cThe people that want to keep status quo don\u2019t need to show anything. It\u2019s the people who want to change the stuff that actually need to demonstrate there is widespread support.\u201d\nAnd for now, not everyone is convinced that SegWit2x does indeed have this level of support \u2014 or anything close to it. While several large mining pools, as well as a significant number of companies, have signed on to the New York Agreement, this agreement was itself drafted without any feedback from Bitcoin\u2019s technical community nor \u2014 even more important \u2014 a reliable gauge of user sentiment. \nAnd while some Bitcoin companies claim to represent their customers, this is \u2014 once again \u2014 not taken for granted by everyone.\n\u201cOne debate I want to draw attention to,\u201d venture capitalist Alyse Killeen pointed out, \u201cis the debate whether businesses speak for their users. I think this is probably a debate you would only see now in this space because it\u2019s pretty well established that businesses outside of this space do not speak for users, but it\u2019s a debate we still have in our community. Of course they don\u2019t.\u201d\nNO2X\nIf Breaking Bitcoin in Paris can be considered at all representative of SegWit2x\u2019s community support \u2014 which, it should be noted, is not necessarily the case \u2014 the proposal will face an uphill battle to be widely accepted in November.\nIndeed, some signatories of the agreement are not so sure about the hard fork anymore: Bitwala and F2Pool have publicly backed out of the agreement. And, during a mining panel in Paris, Bitfury CIO Alex Petrov ever so slightly opened the door to potentially withdrawing support as well, if both the original and the 2x chain manage to survive.\nIn fact, it\u2019s not just that contentious hard forks are considered a threat to be defended against by Bitcoin\u2019s technical community. It goes beyond that.\nIn the words of Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song, at the conclusion of his opening talk of the event:\n\u201cWhat doesn\u2019t kill Bitcoin makes it stronger. And conferences like this prove that we\u2019re getting better at this. We\u2019re getting immunized to all these hard forks, and it\u2019s creating a better Bitcoin as a result, and that\u2019s a very good thing. We\u2019re securing against a lot of these attacks, and figuring out ways to mitigate these threats.\u201d\nImage courtesy of Federico Tenga", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 12}

On Monday, mainstream news sources such as The Guardian, Forbes, Wall Street Journal, and Bloomberg further supported or confirmed these rumors by releasing articles with the news of a Chinese crackdown on exchanges.\nAccording to\u00a0Chinese state newspaper Securities Times,\u00a0\u201cAll trading exchanges must by midnight of 15 September publish a notice to make clear when they will stop all cryptocurrency trading and announce a stop to new user registrations.\"\u00a0\nWithin a day and a half, BTC-USD saw a 15% markdown as the price dropped from $4400 to $3750. After all was said and done, BTC-USD managed to squeeze out one last push before bottoming out around $3000. The bottom was immediately greeted by a strong rally that propelled the price upward by $900.\nThe price shot down, the price shot up \u2014 where does this leave us now?\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 6-Hour Candles, GDAX, Macro Bull Run\nSince the beginning of this bull run from $1800, we have established very clear, very strong support and resistance levels along the Fibonacci Retracement set shown above. At the time of this article, BTC-USD is testing the macro 38% retracement line where strong, historic support will prove quite tough to penetrate. With such a large growth in such a short period of time, BTC-USD managed to climb about 150% in market value within the span of about a month. \nOne idea I\u2019ve been considering during the climbs to toward the ATH is the the Wyckoff trading range schematic shown below: \nFigure 2: Wyckoff Trading Range (A great breakdown of schematic details are found here)\nHistorically, as markets progress through time, they go through phases of accumulation (a phase where investors and traders begin to buy and accumulate assets) and distribution (a phase where traders and investors begin to sell off their accumulated assets). In order words, the market goes up and a bull rally begins, the market begins to top out, and then a bearish rally will bring the prices back down to a comfortable level. It\u2019s a sort of give-and-take in the market as traders begin to place their bets on the future market direction. \nIn our current case, over the last couple months bitcoin has formed a very similar pattern to Distribution Schematic #1 shown above. The above schematic represents one of the possible ways a market can rise, find its top, and distribute assets to market.\nComparing the schematic above to the the current BTC-USD market pattern, we can see a lot of striking similarities:Figure 3: Wyckoff Schematic Within BTC-USD Trend\nThe nomenclature for this schematic is found here and is vital to understanding the upcoming discussion. \nWhile a bearish continuation has yet to be confirmed, the most recent price hike this morning seems to fit the last test of the Wyckoff schematic LPSY (Last Point of Supply). The last point of supply is essentially a false rally where those who didn\u2019t have an opportunity to sell on the previous LPSY now have an opportunity and will begin to sell into the more bullish traders who fall victim to a false breakout. \nThe SOW (sign of weakness) is marked by high sell volume that leads into an AR (automatic rally) where the sell pressure lets up and bullish traders assume a bottom has been hit. The automatic rally is marked by a bullish climb with great ease before finding its top near the previous lines of support shown above in green. \nThe LPSY is most notably described as a series of peaks and valleys on a fairly narrow spread as the bulls and bears exchange positions. During this LPSY, we will expect to see diminishing volume as the market pushes to new highs and becomes more and more difficult. \nA closer view of the current trend reveals we have begun the process of weakening rallies with the LPSY:\nFigure 4: BTC-USD, 5-Minute Candles, Bitfinex\nThroughout the length of this small trend, we can see diminishing volume on each consecutive push toward new highs. If we manage to continue downward, expect turbulence at the $3000 levels and a possible secondary bounce as the $3000 level offers very strong, historic support. \nIt should be noted however, even though this current trend has a strong resemblance to the Wyckoff schematic, it is always important to confirm the trend before trading it. As with any market, it is entirely possible that this Wyckoff distribution pattern will fail and bitcoin will manage to continue onward and upward to new highs. A market reversal should definitely not be ruled out as the current market trend is showing a strong sign of uncertainty between the bulls and bears. \nWhether the market breaks upward or downward, always confirm the move with strong volume to support a strong move in the direction the trend. Volatility is to be expected, but we approach the market with a level head and objectivity, seeing the proper positional entries and exits will much easier to spot.\nSummary:\nStrong, bearish news hit the crypto community this week as China announced harsh regulations on the BTC to fiat transactions on exchanges.Currently BTC is seeing a strong rally off the $3000 levels but is showing signs of waning strength in the upward direction.A possible macro distribution pattern is unfolding and new lows could be in store for \u00a0bitcoin over the next few days and weeks. \nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nStartup company Bloom seeks to take advantage of blockchain technology\u2019s perks to create a platform where the participants will have global access to credit services.\nAccording to Bloom, the traditional methods of credit checking leaves billions of people without basic credit services. The stats of the company show that fewer than 9 percent of the citizens in developing countries have ever taken a loan from a financial institution. The lack of access to credit services forces numerous people to take loans from the shady underworld of illegal lending, the company states. Bloom believes that, no matter the country or the region, access to credit \u201cis a fundamental cornerstone of social mobility\u201d since it is the key for individuals to reach their economic goals.\nBloom also pointed out the problem of governmental monopolies in credit checking. According to the startup, 90 percent of the top lenders in the United States use the FICO score, which is in the hands of the U.S. government. Bloom stated that, despite the popularity of FICO, the credit system leaves over 45 million U.S. citizens with no credit score, thus, they are not allowed to \u2014 or they have to work hard to \u2014 take loans from financial institutions. The blockchain startup also highlighted the issues of other countries:\n\u201cIn China, your credit score is affected by your political opinions. France, Portugal, Spain and the Nordic countries do not have credit scores, opting to only report negative information to your file. In the United Arab Emirates, religious restrictions on lending have prevented the development of a consumer credit reporting system. In the United Kingdom, you will have trouble getting a high credit score if you are not registered to vote.\u201d\nWith its Ethereum-based platform, Bloom seeks to migrate all lenders to the blockchain. The company is currently developing an end-to-end protocol for identity verification, risk assessment and credit scoring, all kept on the blockchain. By implementing blockchain tech, Bloom strives to find solutions to the issues within the credit system. Furthermore, the Bloom platform will offer cross-border, global services for 7 billion individuals, the company wrote.\nImplementing blockchain technology within the credit system would also provide solutions to security issues. Equifax, one of the three largest U.S. credit agencies, was recently breached by cybercriminals, leaving approximately 143 million Americans exposed. The FBI is currently investigating the hack; however, the Equifax cyberattack ranks among the three largest data breaches of all time, according to The Wall Street Journal. The publication reported that the current breach could be the most dangerous of all since the attackers were able to acquire key personal identification documents \u2014 names, addresses, Social Security numbers and dates of birth \u2014 all at once.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly the worst single breach of personal information that I know of. This data is the key to everyone\u2019s files and interactions with financial services, government and health care,\u201d Avivah Litan, vice president of the industry-research firm Gartner Inc., said in a statement to the WSJ.\nEquifax reported that the credit card details of approximately 209,000 U.S. customers were compromised in the hack. According to independent security researcher Andrew Komarov, the financial details could be sold for $500,000 on underground markets, such as dark net marketplaces.\nBloom published a blog post in response to the Equifax breach. The company seeks to solve the security issues within the credit industry by creating their own decentralized protocol. Bloom strives to implement globally federated, secure IDs on the blockchain. This way, according to the startup, they can \u201cdramatically mitigate\u201d the risk of identity theft by reducing their reliance on single-source forms of identity verification.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 12}

This \u201cchainstate\u201d or \u201cUTXO-set\u201d is saved in a dedicated database, whereas previously it had been categorized per transaction. If one transaction sent bitcoins to several outputs (\u201caddresses\u201d), these different outputs were stored as a single database entry, referring to that one transaction.\nWith Bitcoin Core 0.15.0, these outputs are instead stored in a single database entry each. If a single transaction sends bitcoins to different outputs, every output is stored separately. While this method does claim more disc space, it requires less computational resources if one of these outputs is spent later on.\nThe most concrete benefit of this new data structure is that initial sync-time for new nodes is decreased by about 40 percent. It also introduces simpler code, reduces memory usage \u00a0and more. Additionally, it fixes a bug that could theoretically crash Bitcoin Core nodes, controversially revealed at last weekend\u2019s Breaking Bitcoin conference in Paris.\nImproved Fee Estimation\nAs Bitcoin blocks have been filling up over the last year or two, not all transactions fit in the first block that is mined. Instead, miners typically prioritize the transactions that include the most fees. If a user wants to have his transaction confirmed quickly, he should include a high enough fee. If he\u2019s not in a rush, a lower fee should suffice.\nHowever, the Bitcoin network deals with inherent unpredictability in terms of the speed at which blocks are found or the number of transactions that is being transmitted at any time. This makes it hard to include the right transaction fee.\nBitcoin Core 0.15.0 lowers this fee uncertainty: The newest version of the software includes significantly better fee estimation algorithms. This is mostly because the software takes more data into account when making the estimations, such as the fees included in older confirmed transactions, as well as fees in unconfirmed transactions \u2014 the fees that proved insufficient.\nAdditionally, users can enjoy more flexibility. For one, Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 for the first time allows users to include fees that could take their transactions up to a week to confirm. And, also newly introduced, users can choose to accept more or less risk that their transaction could be delayed due to a sudden influx of transactions.\nReplace-by-fee in User Interface\nEven with improved fee estimation, it is possible that users will still need to wait longer than they want for their transactions to confirm, perhaps because there is a sudden rush of transactions on the network, or maybe because a user changed his mind and prefers to have a transaction confirm faster than originally paid for, or for other reasons.\nFor these cases, some wallets let users add a \u201creplace-by-fee\u201d tag to their transactions. With such a tag, nodes and miners on the network know that the sender may want to replace that transaction with a newer transaction that includes a higher fee. This effectively allows users to bump the transaction in line to have it confirmed faster.\nBitcoin Core nodes have supported replace-by-fee for well over a year now: They already replace \u201creplace-by-fee\u201d tagged transactions if the new transaction includes more fees. But it was never easy to utilize for Bitcoin Core wallet users themselves. \nUntil now.\nThe Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 wallet introduces a replace-by-fee toggle in its user interface. This lets users include the appropriate tag, allowing them to easily increase the fees on their transactions later on.\nMulti-wallet Support (Client and RPC Only)\nBitcoin Core 0.15.0 lets users create several wallets for the first time. These wallets all have their own separate Bitcoin addresses, private keys and, therefore, funds. Users can utilize the different wallets for different purposes; for example, one wallet can be used for personal day-to-day purchases, another for business-related transactions, and a third just for trading.\nUsing several wallets can offer a number of benefits. For instance, it makes accounting easier and more convenient. Additionally, users can more easily benefit from increased privacy as the different wallets cannot be linked to each other by blockchain analysis. It\u2019s also possible to use different wallets for specific applications and more.\nFor now, multi-wallet support is not yet available for regular wallet users; only advanced users who operate from the command line or through connected applications can utilize the feature.\nOther Improvements\nApart from the above mentioned notable changes, Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 includes a number of additional performance improvements, as most new major Bitcoin Core releases do. Concretely, these changes speed up how quickly blocks are downloaded from the network, they let nodes start up faster, and up-to-date nodes will be able to validate new blocks more quickly, in turn benefiting network-propagation time.\nFinally, it\u2019s worth mentioning that Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 will disconnect from BTC1 peers on the network. This means that the Bitcoin network will experience less disruption if the SegWit2x hard fork splits the network, as both types of nodes will more easily find compatible peers. While this change has gotten some media attention, this change shouldn\u2019t really be noticeable.\nThanks to Chaincode Labs developer John Newbery for feedback and suggestions.

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nBitso, a cryptocurrency exchange in Mexico, has continues its campaign to aid the victims of the recent earthquake in Mexico.\nA few days ago, Bitso announced their support for the Mexican people who were affected by the recent earthquake. The cryptocurrency exchange has enabled donation wallets that can be used by the company\u2019s clients to send aid using different digital currencies, such as bitcoin, ether and ripple. According to Bitso, cryptocurrency donations are a quick and efficient way to help the victims since the assets are easy to transfer.\nUnfortunately, some people have lost their homes, their belongings, and sadly even the lives of their loved ones. We are hoping this aid will help them return to their daily activities as soon as possible.\nThousands of homes were destroyed and nearly 100 people have died across the country as a result of an earthquake that struck just before midnight on September 7. It reached a magnitude of 8.2 on the Richter scale. \nThe donation details can be found on the cryptocurrency exchange\u2019s blog:\n\u201cJoin this campaign and help the efforts made by the RED CROSS in Mexico by using the hashtag #BitcoinAidMexico and make a donation to one of the following accounts:Bitcoin (BTC) 1DaHfXsoPfZ2jznJhB62vR3QEVFhhZ2tMREthereum (ETH) 0x88B6021aE4BB9830f2E9D5BB38B83427b9D7ffEcRipple (XRP) rEFMdiTbLmZq5ZiMGrWGoyP48DMFqXjNkM [No Destination Tag required]\u201d\nThe Red Cross thus far has been able to set up collection and relief centers in several areas affected by the earthquake, especially in the southern states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, benefiting around 24,000 people. \nDue to the transparency, traceability and real-time reporting of the technology, donations can be easily tracked by users at any time. The total amount Bitso has raised will be exchanged later for Mexican Pesos (MXN) at market rates. Bitso wrote:\n\u201cThe equivalent amount in Mexican Pesos will be transferred using a local bank wire to Cruz Roja I.A.P. (RED CROSS Mexico) to the bank account CLABE 012180004040404062. This CLABE number can be validated on their website https://www.cruzrojamexicana.org.mx or on their twitter account: https://twitter.com/CruzRoja_MX/status/906600599864582144\u201d\nThe deadline for sending the funds is September 15; however, Bitso added that if they still receive funds later, the company will exchange those donations between September 15 and 22, and wire them to the Mexican Red Cross.\nBitso highlighted that there is no minimum amount for donations and that they will accept all transactions. The company wrote that the fundraising started with them donating MXN $50,000, which will be added to the total amount of donations.\nThe amount the company has raised and the transaction proof will be publicly displayed for total transparency.\nBitso emphasized that although the Mexican Red Cross will ultimately receive the funds, user contributions cannot be used as tax deductions.\n\u201cImportant: BITSO will not make any user contributions tax deductible.

With its 120 member banks, the Japanese Bankers Association (JBA) is creating a Collaborative Blockchain Platform and is actively looking for a company to supply its blockchain technology on an ongoing basis.\nExperimenting with the Collaborative Blockchain Platform, the JBA will initially determine which financial services best lend themselves to the new platform, likely including settlement/transfer services, know-your-customer (KYC) systems and financial infrastructure such as their Zengin System and Densai Net System.\nJapanese bitcoin exchange bitFlyer is stepping up to the plate to take on tech giants including Fujitsu, Hitachi and NTT Data to be the supplier of the blockchain platform that will be used by Japan\u2019s banks.\nAlthough it is one of the largest cryptocurrency and blockchain startups in Japan, the Tokyo-based bitFlyer has its work cut out for it if it wants to upset these three corporate heavyweights and win the right to supply the bankers with a blockchain platform using its miyabi technology.\nThe company\u2019s COO Bartek Ringwelski told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cbitFlyer is the only startup in the event, and we have only raised $36mm since 2014, but we have deep expertise in blockchain technology through our virtual currency exchange (the largest in the world by volume, including margin trading) and our \u2018miyabi\u2019 product.\u201d\nBy way of comparison, Hitachi posted $83 billion in revenue in 2016, Fujitsu posted $47 billion on 2015 and NTT Data posted $15 billion in 2016.\nAcknowledging a sea change in Japan\u2019s attitude to cryptocurrency, Ringwelski noted that Japan is actively encouraging and supporting both cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology:\n\u201cJapan is emerging as a leader in blockchain adoption. Japanese consumers are embracing virtual currencies, regulators are proactive, and banks are recognizing the power that blockchain, and specifically miyabi, can bring to the financial infrastructure.\u201d \nMiyabi Blockchain Technology\nThe name \u201cmiyabi\u201d was first coined between the 9th to 12th centuries by Japanese aristocrats to refer to the theme of elegance and refinement.\nAccording to Ringwelski, bitFlyer\u2019s miyabi blockchain platform is the fastest in the world:\n\u201cBased on our research, \u2018miyabi\u2019 is the fastest enterprise-grade blockchain technology, delivering 1,500 - 2,000 transactions per second on average, and in some cases, even faster,\u201d Ringwelski said.\nTheir processing speed of 1,500 to 2,000 transactions per second compares with Bitcoin\u2019s two transactions per second and Ethereum\u2019s seven transactions per second. They also estimate that among the other three competing companies, the maximum speed to beat is 1,000 transactions per second.\nWhen it launched the competition, the JBA made it clear that security and immutability were their first priority. In their view, only a private, permissioned blockchain could satisfy this requirement.\nGoing Global\nBitFlyer\u2019s CEO Yuzo Kano has said he wants the company to go global in the near future and will start by expanding to the U.S. market this fall, initially offering bitcoin trading but expanding to other cryptocurrencies within the next year. The company says it has received approval to start trading from 34 U.S. states.\nIn the meantime, Ringwelski says that they are eagerly awaiting the decision of the JBA:\n\"The partner ultimately chosen by the JBA will stand to become part of the core Japanese banking infrastructure \u2014 it would be a big deal. Beyond the value of gaining the JBA as a new customer, securing a JBA contract would help spread miyabi to new enterprise blockchain applications and customers worldwide.\" \nInvestors in bitFlyer include SMBC Venture Capital, Mizuho Capital, Dai-ichi Life Insurance, Mitsubishi UFJ Capital, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Venture Capital, Recruit Strategic Partners, Dentsu Digital Holdings, SBI Investment, GMO Venture Partners, QUICK and Venture Labo Investment.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 18}
{"title": "Uncertainty Dominates as China Continues to Clamp Down on Cryptocurrencies", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/uncertainty-dominates-china-continues-clamp-down-cryptocurrency/", "birthday": "Sep 19, 2017  4:33 PM EST", "date": "2017-09-19 21:33:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nChina is clamping down on cryptocurrency, that much is clear. But while the developing story dominates headlines, a notable trend is the lack of official information. Chinese officials seem to systematically decline requests for comments, local sources are willing to provide information on condition of anonymity only, while leaked documents remain unverified.\nDespite this lack of clarity, here\u2019s what\u2019s known so far.\nEffects on Trading\nThe most important thing we know for sure is that Chinese bitcoin exchanges will be closing down, or at least exiting China. \nBTCC \u2014 the oldest bitcoin exchange in the world \u2014 was the first exchange to announce they\u2019d be closing shop within the Asian country, by the end of this month. The exchange cited guidelines published by the Chinese central bank (the People\u2019s Bank of China; PBOC), which initially appeared to only affect ICOs, as its reason for closing down. \nOther exchanges quickly followed BTCC's lead. ViaBTC and Yunbi both announced that they\u2019d be ceasing operations by the end of this month. Huobi and OKCoin, the two other major Chinese exchanges, announced they would be shutting down too, though not until the end of October. And BitKan, a big over-the-counter (OTC) trading service rather than an order-book exchange, announced it would be shutting down as well.\nWhile the cited guidelines initially did not seem to concern bitcoin, it is likely that Chinese officials have made it clear through separate channels that they do apply to the cryptocurrency. Bloomberg (among others) reports that exchange operators decided to close down after in-person meetings with PBOC officials, and the Wall Street Journal reports \u2014 based on anonymous sources \u2014 that the PBOC has prepared a set of \u201cdraft instructions\u201d that would ban cryptocurrency trading altogether. These draft instructions have also been leaked (translation) but have so far not been verified for authenticity.\nThe content of the leaked documents is also consistent with warnings issued by a Chinese quasi-regulatory body \u2014 the National Internet Finance Association of China (NIFA) \u2014 regarding cryptocurrency trading, published shortly before exchanges announced that they would be shutting down. \nAccording to the NIFA, Bitcoin exchanges lack \u201clegal basis\u201d to operate in the country. Additionally, NIFA official Li Lihui told a technology conference in Shanghai on Friday that a goal of China\u2019s monetary regulation is to ensure that \u201cthe source and destination of every piece of money can be tracked.\u201d\nThe Status of Bitcoin\nAs far as official statements go, Bitcoin itself is not banned in China. Owning, using, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 mining bitcoin should technically not be affected by the published guidelines.\nHowever, more unverified reports (translation) consistent with reporting from the Wall Street Journal, claim that Bitcoin itself will be blocked by the so-called \u201cgreat firewall of China.\u201d Specifically, seed addresses, which help to bootstrap any new Bitcoin node, and Bitcoin blocks, necessary to construct the blockchain, would be filtered from internet traffic into China, using deep packet inspection. \nAdditionally, major foreign Bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase, Bitfinex and LocalBitcoins would be added to the list of banned domains, which already includes sites like Google and Facebook. And even private trading of cryptocurrency arranged through chat-apps like Telegram and WeChat, for example, could fall under scrutiny, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nThis much stricter stance on Bitcoin, beyond just exchanges but also concerning Bitcoin itself, seem consistent with comments from PBOC Counselor Sheng Songcheng, as reported by local news sources like Shanghai Securities News. Songcheng was quoted to have said that Bitcoin poses a challenge to China, mentioning money laundering and its potential to curb the nation\u2019s economic policy.\nFurthermore, very recent reports indicate that cryptocurrency exchange operators are currently not allowed to leave Beijing. Local news outlet BJ News writes:\u201c[According to] a number of informed sources, the current special currency trading platform executives and so on are not allowed to leave Beijing, [in order] to cooperate with the investigation. In accordance with regulatory requirements, the trading platform shareholders, the actual controller, executives, financial executives [must] fully cooperate with the relevant work in the clean-up period in Beijing.\u201d (Rough translation.)\nWhat This Means\u2026\nTrading bitcoin via dedicated exchange platforms in China is off the table for now \u2014 that is clear.\nBut it\u2019s not yet clear how successful a full Chinese Bitcoin blockade could be. It would technically only require a single Bitcoin block of a maximum of four megabytes to make it into China about once every 10 minutes, potentially even through satellite, for the entire country to be able to access the blockchain. As such, banning individual Chinese citizens from owning and using bitcoin might prove difficult, even if exchange platforms close down.\nPerhaps an even more important question is what will happen to Bitcoin mining: It\u2019s likely that most of Bitcoin\u2019s hash power is currently situated in the Asian country. While miners should able to connect to the rest of the world, according to ViaBTC CEO Haipo Yang, it\u2019s unclear if this connection will be allowed for much longer. If Chinese authorities indeed intend to ban Bitcoin from the country entirely, some Bitcoin mining operations \u2014 both mining pools and hash power data centers \u2014 will be easy targets to shut down.\nOn the other hand, this is not the first time that fears of China \u201cbanning Bitcoin\u201d have been raised. In the past, such concerns have simply been a prelude to stricter regulations by local authorities. \nIt has been suggested by Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu, perhaps a bit optimistically, that exchanges will simply require a new license to continue operation. Similarly, it\u2019s been speculated that the PBOC may introduce a national digital currency as a sort of gateway to cryptocurrency: This would allow the central bank to better track the flow of funds in and out of bitcoin in order to counter money laundering and capital flight. \nThen again, it could make more sense to introduce such a national digital currency as a substitute for Bitcoin, once Bitcoin is effectively banned, as suggested by ZeroHedge.\nFor now, uncertainty prevails.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 19}
{"title": "Op Ed: How Blockchain Technology Will Disrupt Digital Content Distribution", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-how-blockchain-technology-will-disrupt-digital-content-distribution/", "birthday": "Sep 18, 2017 2:35 PM EST", "date": "2017-09-18 19:35:00", "content": "The way we consume media content has been on a continual overhaul for the past two decades. Every aspect of media distribution has become more streamlined from the razor-thin devices we use to consume media to the manner in which we purchase and store our coveted content. Books, music and movies have all seen their physical bodies and storage locations dissolve, to be replaced with on-demand downloads and digital copies.\nThe digital content revolution has done a lot for increasing access and visibility for artists and authors, but the current publishing giants have failed to adequately adjust to the times in a few crucial areas. While it's true that platforms such as YouTube and Medium have granted publishing access to the greater public and eliminated gatekeeping middlemen like talent agents and PR people, the current digital content sharing platforms have built their empires on the skeletons of the publishing giants\u2019 templates that existed before and, unfortunately, have continued operating in ways that fundamentally undermine the artistic control and profits of their contributors. \u00a0\u00a0\nYouTube, for example, recently announced they will not allow users to earn any money until they reach 10 thousand views. Medium was recently very candid about the moral dilemmas and growing pains they have faced while trying to balance the selling of advertising space as well as respecting their contributing authors and readership. And it's no secret that Amazon and iTunes take a chunk out of authors\u2019 and artists\u2019 earnings, with iTunes currently pocketing 30 percent of its artists\u2019 profits and Amazon taking a hefty 30\u201375 percent.\nThough it\u2019s easy to be critical, I am more interested in looking for a viable alternative to disrupt the existing system. This will require harnessing the decentralizing nature of emerging blockchain content distribution technologies. Here\u2019s why:\nBlockchain could be the solution to making micropayments a reality.\nAs media consumption has gone digital, a cost-effective way to charge per article or per song has been a limiting factor. Many platforms and publications have opted for subscription-based charging as high transaction costs make pay-per-use charging impossible. Amazon, for example, passes on its internal transaction costs to their clients, which currently equal 2.9 percent of the total transaction as well as a flat fee of 0.30 cents for every transaction.\nThe pricey transactions make processing small charges inefficient and not cost-effective, which has led many experts, such as editor of TechCrunch John Biggs, to predict that the future of digital publishing will depend on the adoption of micropayments.\nBlockchain technologies allow for an incredible number of transactions to be processed at a low cost. Decentralized blockchain systems distribute the collective payment history across the entire network and don\u2019t favor any single \u201cauditor.\u201d The network is maintained by all blockchain nodes as a whole. \nEmerging blockchain transaction processing speeds have also recently shot past the leading blockchain currency, bitcoin, and would be capable of processing on a large scale. Where Bitcoin's transaction speeds average 7 transactions per second, new blockchain-based currencies are already approaching thousands of transactions per second; Bitshares claims they can process 100,000 per second.\nIn fact, a newspaper in Winnipeg, Canada, has already begun to use a micropayment system to charge per article for its news content and projects earning over $100,000 in digital revenue.\nBlockchain could tilt the balance of power towards individuals, not publishing powerhouses.\nAs mentioned previously, YouTube and Medium have dramatically increased content creators\u2019 access to audiences and established a more democratic, popularity-based promotional scheme. Unfortunately, they are both still centralized content distribution entities that can make arbitrary and unilateral decisions. YouTube and Medium both have the right to remove comments, content or entire channels or profiles without leaving a trace.\nIn contrast, a blockchain content distribution platform preserves an unchangeable record of all actions. The record produced by blockchain systems creates an environment of total transparency for both content creators and media consumers, and it also ensures that all views, comments and ratings reflect the real interactions the content has experienced, leaving no room for subjective, inflated ratings or deleted bad reviews. \nWith nothing deleted, content producers can create and post with the security that their work and reputation will remain intact, trolls can\u2019t hide their past bad behavior and can easily be spotted via their comment history, and all content fairly reflects its actual popularity.\nBlockchain technology could provide instant payouts and security.\nToday, freelancers, authors and artists working with publishing platforms are accustomed to waiting multiple months to receive payment for their work. For big-name artists, this is just part of the business. But for smaller artists, it can be difficult to wait for reimbursement without any idea of how much they will eventually be paid. The financial uncertainty, prolonged waiting periods and lack of payment transparency in current digital content media sharing platforms could be discouraging potential artists and authors from seeing content creation as a viable source of income. Instead, the system encourages content creators to seek payment, not for the quality of their content, but through product sponsorships, PR and ad-focused content.\nWith blockchain-based content distribution, content creators can be paid within seconds of a consumer paying for a download. Consumers would also know their purchase was directly supporting the content creators they enjoy and effectively cut out the publishing middlemen eating up the content producer\u2019s profits.\nThough blockchain technology may, at times, sound a bit hard to conceptualize, digital media distribution really shouldn\u2019t be rocket science. While the zeros and ones behind publishing platforms get more complex, the process for content creators and consumers has simplified and should continue to do so.\nThe bottom line is content creators who make good quality content that people are willing to pay for deserve a simple and transparent digital media sharing platform that fairly compensates them according to the consumer demand for their work. Media consumers equally deserve the ability to directly support the content creators they enjoy. And blockchain technologies may be the disruptive technology that digital media content distribution needs.\nThis is a guest post by Matej Michalko, founder and CEO of DECENT.

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nThe Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA) announced its launch on August 16, 2017. According to the alliance, their goal is to utilize blockchain tech in the trucking industry \u2014 an industry that \u201chas a reputation of being behind the curve on technology.\u201d\n\u201cWe formed the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance to develop common standards around blockchain applications in the trucking industry, from speeding up transactions to securing data transfers. The technology holds great promise, but to encourage its proliferation, we believe that developing industry standards were paramount. PS Logistics brings a depth of industry experience and full-service logistics knowledge to help our industry innovate with integrity through this new technology,\u201d Craig Fuller, CEO of TransRisk and co-founder of BiTA, said in a statement.\nBy implementing blockchain technology, BiTA seeks to use triple-entry accounting, which the organization believes would solve some of the industry\u2019s most pressing concerns. Some of the improvements would include immediate payment of drivers upon delivery; transparent and verifiable maintenance records; immediate and self-executing payments for things like fuel and parts; more efficient and fair processes for disputes and arbitrage over freight quality and claims; and immutable carrier history and safety records.\n\u201cBlockchain [technology] by its nature is distributed and owned by no single person. It is open source and requires collaboration and standards,\u201d said Fuller. \u201cWe are helping to launch BiTA as a way to initiate dialogue between parties in the trucking ecosystem.\u201d \nAccording to the organization, the main difficulty they are currently facing is the integration of blockchain tech into the trucking industry. BiTA encourages the recording of physical transactions (i.e., a load being delivered) in a digital format. The organization believes the evolution of blockchain technology will bridge the gap between \u201canalog and physical transactions to digital transactions and the blockchain.\u201d \nThe members of BiTA are currently discussing the options and methods of blockchain technology\u2019s implementation.\n\u201cWe have relationships with many of the Alliance members that are not related to blockchain [technology], but the conversation around blockchain keeps coming up and many of them are exploring blockchain [tech],\u201d said Fuller, \u201cbut most are concerned about making significant investments because of the lack of standards and commercial adoption.\u201d \nBiTA said, \u201cWe are engaging the brightest minds from the most influential leaders in transportation, finance, and technology. BiTA will build the first set of transportation industry\u2013specific blockchain standards and promote the most transformative technology since the internet.\u201d\nBiTA has since announced the addition of PS Logistics as their newest member. According to BiTA, PS Logistics, as a charter member along with TransRisk, Triumph Business Capital and McLeod Software, will employ the use of smart technology and uniform performance standards in order to advance the transportation industry. The organization is currently listed as a logistics charter member along with the U.S. Xpress Inc. and Convoy.", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 29}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin Cash (Bcash or BCH) has been more profitable to mine than Bitcoin (BTC) on multiple occasions over the past week or two. This is creating a new dynamic within Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem \u2014 one which is not really beneficial for either coin.\nIn Bitcoin Magazine's previous article on this topic, we explained why Bcash mining should normally not affect Bitcoin too much, aside from the incidental higher fees and slower confirmations. We also explained why this dynamic could, in the meantime, ruin Bcash, as it should freeze that blockchain in its tracks.\nWe also noted that Bcash has a built-in emergency solution to mitigate the risk, which could get its blockchain moving again. But this solution does assume either that some miners are choosing to act against their own short-term interest at certain times for the benefit of all miners \u2014 or that miners are coordinating for their mutual benefit, on some level.\nNow, several days later, it appears that this is what\u2019s happening. Some miners are either acting against their short-term interests for specific periods of time \u2014 or they are coordinating to trigger the emergency solution.The good news for Bcash is that this means its blockchain is still in motion for now, at least on most days. But at the same time, the dynamic generated by the emergency solution is benefiting its miners overall, more than anyone else \u2014 and it\u2019s even calling into question the long-term viability of Bitcoin Cash itself.\nThe Emergency Difficulty Adjustment\nFirst, a brief recap of Bitcoin mining and Bcash\u2019s built-in emergency solution.\nMining profitability is determined by the value of the block reward (newly mined coins plus transaction fees) and the \u201cdifficulty\u201d to mine a block. If the value of the block rewards are higher and the difficulty is lower, miners make more money.\nThe difficulty on both Bitcoin and Bcash self-adjusts each time 2016 blocks are mined. If it takes longer than two weeks to mine these 2016 blocks, difficulty adjusts downward so it becomes easier to mine. If it takes less than two weeks, the difficulty adjusts upward so it becomes harder.\nBcash really needs its difficulty to be low enough to match the value of its block rewards in relation to Bitcoin. So, if Bcash's block reward is worth 15 percent of Bitcoin\u2019s block reward, Bcash\u2019s difficulty must also be 15 percent of Bitcoin\u2019s difficulty, or lower. Otherwise, Bitcoin will be more profitable to mine, and miners will really have no reason ever to return to Bcash, leaving the Bcash blockchain frozen in its tracks.\nThe big problem is that, as long as Bcash\u2019s block rewards do not exceed Bitcoin\u2019s block rewards, this is bound to happen sooner or later. At some point, Bcash difficulty will exceed what its block reward will be worth, at which point all miners should leave.\nTo mitigate this problem, Bcash implemented a feature called the \u201cemergency difficulty adjustment\u201d (EDA). If in a space of at least twelve hours, fewer than six blocks are mined, the difficulty adjusts downwards by 20 percent for the next block. If miners coordinate or time this well, this can bring difficulty down by about 75 percent within a day.\nThe Problems\nWhile triggering the EDA is preferable over a blockchain frozen in its tracks forever, it does present new problems.\nOnce difficulty is low enough, profit-maximizing miners are incentivized to jump on Bcash mining, producing an enormous number of blocks before difficulty adjusts within a day or two. Then, once the difficulty adjusts upward by a lot, and all these miners will switch back to Bitcoin \u2014 until some miners trigger Bcash\u2019s EDA again, potentially after 12 hours or so, and all miners hop back on Bcash, creating a sort of stop-and-go cycle, on repeat.\nIn our previous article, we noted that this stop-and-go cycle is not ideal for users. But we didn\u2019t go into specifics about what problems those would be, exactly. And there are a number of them\u2026\nFirst of all, this stop-and-go cycle actually causes a disturbance for Bitcoin users as well. Each time miners hop on Bcash, hash power leaves the Bitcoin network, which means that Bitcoin blocks are mined more slowly. As a result, Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees and confirmation times go up. And the fact that miners are intentionally gaming the system like this, suggests that the situation could drag on for a while: potentially weeks or months, and maybe even longer depending on how Bcash develops.\nMeanwhile, this cycle makes Bitcoin Cash confirmation times very unreliable. On some days, transactions confirm very quickly, as blocks are found about every minute. On other days, there are (almost) no new blocks at all for at least 12 hours, and transactions take incredibly long to confirm, by comparison.\nArguably, an even bigger problem is that because of this dynamic, Bcash mining rewards \u2014 new coins \u2014 enter the system much more quickly: currently about four times faster than they are supposed to. As a result, Bcash\u2019s inflation rate is relatively high. While Bitcoin\u2019s current yearly inflation rate sits at about 4 percent, Bcash\u2019s yearly inflation rate is on pace to be closer to 16 percent. This favors miners who earn these coins \u2014 at the cost of coin-holders.\nWhat\u2019s more, because of this same dynamic, Bcash\u2019s next block halving will arrive much faster as well, possibly around mid 2018 instead of mid 2020. And if nothing changes, there could even be another halving by early 2019: the block reward could fall to 3.125 BCH in just a little over a year from now.\nThese halvings is where Bcash\u2019s real problems could begin.\nAs perhaps its central value proposition compared to Bitcoin, Bcash wants to keep its transaction fees extremely low; even as low as zero. Therefore, it is not clear that fees will make up for the loss in rewards; it seems especially unlikely that these losses will be made up within a year, if ever. So unless the market price of BCH, compared to BTC, increases by a lot, and fast, the value of Bcash\u2019s block reward could dwindle significantly.\nNow, keep in mind that for miners to mine Bcash at all, its difficulty must be even lower than its block reward, compared to Bitcoin, and that if that is the case, all profit-maximizing miners are expected to pile on.\nThat means that all these miners will be able to mine the 2016 blocks even faster when they do all pile on Bcash. Instead of two days, it could take them even one day. Or less. Which would, of course, mean that the next block halving will be reached even faster. This would in turn means that the block rewards would be even less valuable, difficulty would needs to be even lower for miners to hop on, and miners would be able to mine the 2016 blocks even faster next time. Maybe even in half a day.\nBcash\u2019s EDA could lead to vicious downward spiral, which would significantly decrease Bcash\u2019s security against 51% attacks. It would also make it easier for miners hostile to Bcash to frustrate the system in other ways; for example, they could prevent emergency adjustments from kicking in. Moreover, Bcash could reach the point where its block rewards aren\u2019t even worth the time and effort for miners to switch between chains, and Bcash freezes in its tracks, after all.\nBitcoin Cash will need to fix this problem somehow, and by now developers are indeed discussing the issue. Either that, or the coin must become more valuable than Bitcoin to mitigate the problem altogether \u2014 fast.\nThanks to Johnathan Corgan for feedback.", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 27}

The $2850 growth marks the sixth week in a row of new highs and aggressive bull runs as bitcoin sits upon its current all-time high in the $4600s. One can\u2019t help but wonder where the top of this run lies; Goldman Sachs is calling the top of the bull run at around $4800.\nHistorically, during times of war and political uncertainty, investors tend to seek financial safe havens in precious metals and other long-lasting, stable investment vehicles. Yesterday, North Korea made an aggressive move toward Japan by launching a missile over Japanese airspace. Within hours of the news hitting the public, Bitcoin saw massive price growth, thus establishing, once again, a new all-time high:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 6 Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Volume Spike Post-news Release\nAfter an entire week of decreasing volume, BTC-USD saw a spike in buy volume once the news of North Korea\u2019s aggression hit the public. This is one of several bullish moves in the recent series of news events following North Korean aggression. As of the time of this article, Japan has yet to formally respond to this act of aggression, and one can speculate that bitcoin will likely continue to see price growth as the political uncertainty continues to grow.\nOn the macro scale, Bitcoin is showing signs of bullish exhaustion despite the push to greater highs:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Bitfinex, Signs of Bullish Exhaustion\nAlthough there is a good argument for Bitcoin price growth on just fundamental analysis of the North Korean situation alone, it\u2019s important to remain objective in our analysis. There are three signs of bullish exhaustion in the macro trend of this BTC-USD market. \nAlthough Bitcoin is making new price highs, on the 1-day candle trend the RSI is failing to make a new high (shown in yellow) \u2014 this activity is called \u201cdivergence\u201d and shows a decrease in bullish momentum. Additionally, although the 6-hour volume made a significant impact on the market, the 1-day volume is currently failing to make any significant impact on the overall trend (shown in blue). \nLastly and most significantly, the 1-day Bollinger Bands (shown in pink) have begun to go completely horizontal and are now beginning to actually curve downward. \nThe current Bollinger Band trend accompanied by the bullish momentum loss is pushing BTC-USD into a potential reversal pattern known as \u201cThree Pushes to a High.\u201d Basic characteristics of this pattern are:\nNarrowing Bollinger Bands upon the advance of each high;Momentum loss on various indicators;Continued divergence across all three highs.\nCurrently, the \u201cThree Pushes to a High\u201d reversal has yet to be confirmed and is certainly not in a tradable condition, but it is something that every Bitcoin trader should consider on the macro trend of this market. \nSince the run from $1800, well established Fibonacci Retracement lines have revealed themselves on the market:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 6 Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Macro Support Lines\nThere is very strong support on the 23% line, as the market consolidated for about a week at those values. If our current price level proves to be the top of this run, a possible retracement might occur. Should a retracement occur, Figure 3 will be an important reference in order to see, on a macro scale, where the support levels lie and where potential market entry and exits will exist. \nSummary:\nUncertainty surrounding Japan\u2019s response to North Korean aggression reveals investor interest in Bitcoin;Technical indicators show the market is possibly approaching its top on the macro-trend;Support lines exist on the Fibonacci Retracement values shown in Figure 3.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Here are 10 Regulatory Points to Ponder", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-planning-ico-canada-here-are-10-regulatory-points-ponder/", "birthday": "Aug 30, 2017 5:03 PM EST", "date": "2017-08-30 22:03:00", "content": "Canada\u2019s securities regulators are paying attention to ICOs. Last week they released a guidance document that explains their approach to token sales/ICOs/ITOs/crowdsales, officially titled \u201cCSA Staff Notice 46-307: Cryptocurrency Offerings.\u201d Here is what this notice means and what it doesn\u2019t mean.\nIn the press release that accompanied the Staff Notice, Louis Morisset, the chair of the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and the head of the Quebec securities regulator, is quoted as saying: \u201cThe technology behind cryptocurrency offerings has the potential to generate new capital-raising opportunities for businesses and we welcome this type of innovation \u2026\u201d The press release recommends the Staff Notice to anyone \u201c\u2026 planning to raise capital through an ICO or ITO, or that is seeking to establish a cryptocurrency investment fund.\u201d \nThe global legal backdrop to Staff Notice 46-307 is increased regulatory scrutiny of token offerings, including the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission report on \u201cThe DAO\u201d issued last month and the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s issuance of a regulatory position. \nBefore diving into what the Staff Notice says, it\u2019s important to understand what a Staff Notice is. The author of the Staff Notice is the CSA, an association of provincial and territorial securities regulators. Regulation of securities is conducted on a provincial basis and is not done at a country-wide level like in most jurisdictions. The CSA is a national forum for harmonizing securities rules and this Staff Notice is essentially a joint position on how Canada\u2019s many securities regulators view ICOs. \nThe Staff Notice is interesting but it is not a legal change. It does not create any new rules in Canada but it does provide some clarity for anyone seeking to understand how Canadian securities law applies to token sales. \u00a0\nHere are ten key takeaways from the CSA Staff Notice:\n1. Regulators will treat each token using a case-by-case approach\nA widespread fear in the blockchain industry is that regulators will somehow \u201cshut down\u201d token sales. The Staff Notice assuages that fear:\n\u201cEvery ICO/ITO is unique and must be assessed on its own characteristics. For example, if an individual purchases coins/tokens that allow him/her to play video games on a platform, it is possible that securities may not be involved. However, if an individual purchases coins/tokens whose value is tied to the future profits or success of a business, these will likely be considered securities.\u201d \nThis is a great paragraph to see. The regulators are communicating what any lawyer working in this area would have confirmed for a client: Some tokens are securities and some aren\u2019t. This means that the regulators aren\u2019t interested in a knee-jerk response that paints all token sales with the same broad brush. \n2. Substance will trump form when it comes to ICOs\nA security is not a security because of the words used but because of what it is. The Staff Notice includes a warning to this effect: \n\u201cStaff is aware of businesses marketing their coins/tokens as software products, taking the position that the coins/tokens are not subject to securities laws. However, in many cases, when the totality of the offering or arrangement is considered, the coins/tokens should properly be considered securities. In assessing whether or not securities laws apply, we will consider substance over form.\u201d\nAn illegal securities offering can\u2019t be dressed up to make it a legal product. A high-level staffer in the Ontario Securities Commission was quoted in the Globe and Mail on the same day that the Staff Notice was issued: \u201cSo what we\u2019re trying to do is raise awareness that just because you\u2019ve called something a coin or token doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s now a loophole and you can go and promise your investors great returns, not provide any sort of documentation and not ensure what you\u2019re selling to them is actually suitable for them.\u201d\n3. The CSA thinks many ICOs are securities offerings aimed at retail investors\nProducts are purchased. Capital is invested. When a store sells a good, they don\u2019t consider that sale to be \u201cinvestment.\u201d Yet the world of ICOs is filled with references to token investors rather than token buyers. Many people speak of \u201craising capital\u201d when they sell a token, while resisting the characterization of that transaction as the sale of securities. As the Staff Notice points out:\n\u201cICOs/ITOs are generally used by start-up businesses to raise capital from investors through the internet. These investors are often retail investors.\u201d\nMany ICOs are being done in order to \u201craise capital,\u201d rather than to create revenue through the sale of products, and the securities regulators have taken notice. The reference to \u201cretail investors\u201d acknowledges that most of the activity is taking place at the individual level rather than through institutional, large corporate or fund investments. This paragraph indicates that the CSA may view most ICOs/ITOs as securities offerings. \n4. The existing legal framework for securities will be applied: Pacific Coin\nA critical case in Canadian securities law is the 1978 Supreme Court decision of Pacific Coast Coin Exchange v. Ontario Securities Commission. This is the leading case on what a \u201csecurity\u201d is in Canada and it\u2019s explicitly mentioned in the Staff Notice. The case lays out the following test: \n\u201c1. An investment of money 2. In a common enterprise 3. With the expectation of profit 4. To come significantly from the efforts of others.\u201d \nThis test is similar to the Howey test in the United States. Note that this isn\u2019t a \u201ctest\u201d in the way that most people would understand that word. A legal test is a framework for decision-making that requires understanding the facts, circumstances and recent cases. Consultation with a lawyer will be necessary in order to understand how this test applies to any given situation \u2014 and even then it may not be clear. \nEssentially, this section of the Staff Notice shows that they\u2019re not planning a unique approach to ICOs. Token sales will be integrated into the existing legal rules for securities.\n5. The Regulated System (or why white papers aren\u2019t sufficient disclosure under Canadian securities law) \nIf a token is a security, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it can\u2019t be sold. It does mean that if it\u2019s sold there will be many rules to follow. The CSA helpfully explains the system in Canada for selling token-securities at a high-level:\n\u201cTo date, no business has used a prospectus to complete an ICO/ITO in Canada. We anticipate that businesses looking to sell coins/tokens may do so under prospectus exemptions. Sales may be made to investors who qualify as \u2018accredited investors\u2019 as defined under securities laws, in reliance on the accredited investor prospectus exemption. For retail investors who do not qualify as accredited investors, sales will typically need to be made in reliance on the offering memorandum (OM) prospectus exemption.\u201d\nThe above section is followed by a note that \u201cwhite papers\u201d are not sufficient disclosure to meet Canadian securities rules. \n6. There are can be civil as well as regulatory consequences for non-compliance \nWhat happens if Canadian securities rules aren\u2019t followed? The CSA reminds people that beyond regulatory penalties there may be civil penalties:\n\u201cIt should also be noted that investors may also have civil remedies against persons or companies that fail to comply with securities laws, including a right to withdraw from the transaction and/or damages for losses on the grounds that such transactions were conducted in breach of securities laws.\u201d\nThe above warning applies to securities-related penalties/remedies. There may also be other civil causes of action generated by an improper sale. Canadian law has many opportunities for buyers to sue sellers for tricking them or not properly explaining what they were selling.\n7. Cryptocurrency investment funds ought to follow the rules for funds too\nOne of the explicit audiences for the Staff Notice is people running or considering running cryptocurrency investment funds. Pages 5-6 have excellent information on what the legal compliance steps are for properly running a crypto fund in Canada. \n8. Some token sales are securities offerings, and some token-securities are also derivatives\nSecurities can also be derivatives and there may be additional rules that apply. The CSA notes that there might be two sets of rules to follow:\n\u201cWe note that these products may also be derivatives and subject to the derivatives laws adopted by the Canadian securities regulatory authorities, including trade reporting rules.\u201d\n9. Resale restrictions need to be considered for tokens that are securities\nThere is a paragraph in the Staff Notice that could be easily overlooked but contains a very useful tip for anyone designing token systems:\n\u201cAllowing coins/tokens that are securities issued as part of an ICO/ITO to trade on these cryptocurrency exchanges may also place the business issuing the coins/tokens offside securities laws. For example, the resale of coins/tokens that are securities will be subject to restrictions on secondary trading.\u201d\nThis paragraph is a challenge to lawyers who are working on ICOs that are or may be securities. They will have to consider how the rules that apply to securities will be enforced by the system being deployed. How will resale restrictions imposed by securities laws be reflected in the technical system? Will we end up with a new ERC standard for regulated tokens that don\u2019t permit transfer? Or that locks the token for a period of time? A token that doesn\u2019t include the legal rules in its technical rules could end up creating legal trouble for the proponents. \n10. The regulatory focus has shifted from crypto investment risks to tokens as securities\nIn 2014, the securities regulators (specifically, the Ontario Securities Commission) viewed digital currencies through the lens of transactions and speculation: \n\u201cVirtual (or digital) currencies like Bitcoin are being used as a type of money and offer a novel way to make purchases and transact business online. However, it remains unclear what virtual currency truly represents. Is it actually money? An investment? Something else? This is still a largely uncharted and unsupervised area, and no protections are likely available to you if you become involved with virtual currency and something goes wrong.\u201d\nThe Staff Notice is a shift in thinking, away from the \u201cbuyer beware\u201d stance that they held before and a recognition that blockchain development is rapidly moving beyond payments and into many other areas of the economy. \n\nThis is a guest post by\u00a0Addison Cameron-Huff, a Canadian blockchain technology lawyer.

A sustained breakdown of this pattern would give an approximate price target of the low $300 values. \nTo understand whether the downward move is a sustained move or merely a support test, we will have to observe the volume trend in correlation with price movement. Sustained volume growth within a downward move indicates less confidence in higher values, and higher interest in the lower values. \nA sustained move on the micro trend could lead to a test of a potential macro trend on the high timescales. Similar to the 1-hour candle trend, the 4-hour candle trend also shows an Ascending Wedge:\nFigure 4: ETH-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Macro Ascending Wedge\nA breakdown of this rising wedge could have a significant price target in the $250\u2013260 range. Again, when confirming the macro trend breakdown, it is a good idea to watch the volume to confirm a trend and reduce the risk of a market fakeout. \nWhether the market is interested in a sustained move to lower values remains to be seen. However, a couple things are very clear: the overall market volume is decreasing with every push to higher values, and the RSI and MACD on both macro and micro scales are showing bullish momentum loss. \nSummary:\nBullish momentum loss is visible across both the micro and macro trends.Currently, the ETH-USD 1-hour candle trend is testing the lower boundary of a rising wedge and has yet to have a confirmed breakdown of the pattern.A breakdown in price in the current market could lead to a sustained bearish market on the macro scale.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Now, the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) has announced its own plans to form a panel to regulate Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).\nThis week, the ISA announced that its chairman, Prof. Shmuel Hauser, has put together a committee to examine the regulation of ICOs. The committee will investigate the applicability of securities regulations on ICOs based on shared ledgers that are being offered to the Israeli public.\nOn July 31, the Israeli Bitcoin Association (IBA) made its own official public statement on the topic of ICOs. The IBA cautioned potential ICO participants that it\u2019s important to understand the huge risks that exist in investing in ICOs. \nThis new world tends to captivate innocents tempted by the hope of getting rich quick. We implore the public considering investment in ICOs to treat the matter with serious consideration, out of a recognition that investors might lose all their money.\nRegarding regulation, the Association cautioned that \u201cthe regulatory attitude towards this area is yet to be clarified. On one hand, this means investors will find it difficult to demand their rights, due to a lack of an appropriate infrastructure. On the other hand, it is possible that in the future there will be a regulatory intervention in a specific project or in the whole domain, which may hurt its continued operation.\u201d\nIt seems that that time \u201cin the future\u201d for defined regulation is now in the works.\nUdi Wertheimer, an Israeli blockchain researcher, read this latest announcement from the ISA in its original Hebrew and provided Bitcoin Magazine with his translation of the document. \n\u201cThe announcement itself is neutral in tone,\u201d Wertheimer told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cpointing out that the ISA is interested in encouraging new investment and funding options, and does not wish to stifle new innovations, but at the same time acknowledging that some ICOs turned out to be scams and others involved market manipulation, while yet others ended up being hacked in various ways, all leading to investor funds being lost.\u201d\nThe document lays out its rationale as follows:\nWhile considering the ISA\u2019s policy in the last year on developing innovative funding models in parallel with keeping the interests of investors and warning from unregulated investments, it seems there\u2019s a growing need of regulation in the field of ICOs. The committee\u2019s job will include investigating this activity and the applicability of Israeli law as it exists today and as it may have to be adjusted, while reviewing their legal status in other countries.\n\u201cThis is the first time I know of that Israeli authorities referred to ICOs directly. Israel is home to many ICOs, like Bancor, Kik\u2019s Kin, Stox, CoinDash and others,\u201d said Wertheimer.\nHe noted that the ISA recently cracked down on \u201cbinary options\u201d companies, which tried to subvert security laws but were eventually identified as illegal. Even though these companies were registered elsewhere, the ISA forced them to shut down operations both in Israel and abroad.\nWertheimer also summarized the committee\u2019s responsibilities as described in the document: \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWertheimer told Bitcoin Magazine: \u201cPersonally, I hope that regulators keep a hands-off approach in the near future, as I\u2019m still hoping this field can still find a way to self-regulate. However, given the massive PR push by these ICOs both in Israel and internationally, I\u2019m not surprised the ISA decided to take a close look.\u201d\nMeni Rosenfeld of the Israeli Bitcoin Association told Bitcoin Magazine that the Association has not yet formulated a stance on the ISA\u2019s investigation.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 1}

Bitcoin has been on a strong bull run since its bottom in the $1800s and, despite many technical indicators, has pushed to new highs, week after week. With the international uncertainty surrounding the North Korean conflict and the recent news of Dalia Blass\u2019s recent hire at the SEC, there is plenty of bullish news to fuel the push. However, the current BTC-USD all-time high resides in the lower $4800s, which many market analysts say is the local top of this run.\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 6-Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Recent Bull Fibonacci Extension\nTypical Fibonacci Extensions are 127% and 160% of the total length of the bull run. $2600 (0% retracement value shown above) marks the breakout point of the current bull market BTC-USD is experiencing. There have been 4 attempts made to break the $4480 values (100% retracement value shown above). Due to the prolonged effort to break these values, we can make the argument that $4480s are the local top values; any values that breach beyond the $4480s are extensions of the bull run. \nA week ago, BTC-USD made a test of the lower $3600s in a move that would ultimately bounce and push us to our current all time high. However, the move from the local bottom to the $4800s is currently forming a reversal pattern called a \u201cRising Wedge.\u201d Although a Rising Wedge has a relatively high rate of failure, it is still something BTC-USD traders should keep an eye on:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Rising Wedge\nThe Rising Wedge is characterized by higher highs and higher lows that converge about an ascending value. For anyone trading reversal patterns, it is paramount to confirm the breakout before entering a position. In low confidence patterns like Rising Wedges, we must wait for a breakout below the wedge and for strong trading volumes to increase the likelihood of success. Some evidence that points toward a possible reversal is the RSI and MACD divergence. \nDivergence is essentially an indication that there is potential bullish momentum loss in the market. It\u2019s important to note that bearish divergence does not guarantee a market reversal and it does not mean the market will pullback. The only thing we are permitted to take away from bearish divergence is the argument that the market has an increased probability of either consolidation or a market pullback. In strong bull markets, bearish divergence can be seen for hours, days and even weeks.\nShould the Rising Wedge break to the bottom, we can calculate the expected price move as follows:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Rising Wedge Price Target\nIn our case, should the Rising Wedge break to the bottom, we can expect an approximate $500 move downward. However, should the pattern fail to break to the bottom, we can expect a price upward to test the 127% Fibonacci Extension values around $5000 before encountering any significant resistance.\nSummary:\nGlobal uncertainty surrounding North Korea\u2019s aggression plus ETF optimism give further evidence to support a continued bullish market.A potential Rising Wedge could potentially cause a $500 BTC-USD market retracement. The pattern has yet to be confirmed.Should the Rising Wedge fail to break to the bottom, we can expect a further push toward the 127% Fibonacci Extension values of $5000.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe Bitcoin Cash (Bcash or BCH) mining saga continues.\nLast week, Bitcoin Magazine reported how \u2014 assuming all miners would act in their short-term self-interest \u2014 Bcash could potentially have its blockchain freeze in its tracks. Then, last weekend, the Bcash mining saga further developed, as some miners periodically triggered an emergency difficulty adjustment, leading to extreme swings in hash power, unreliable block times and increased inflation.\nNow, the situation has taken yet another turn.\nBitcoin Cash is currently less profitable to mine than Bitcoin (BTC). And according (translation) to at least one mining pool operator, BTC.TOP\u2019s Jiang Zhuo\u2019er, this is intentional. Some miners, including Zhou\u2019er, seem to be coordinating to keep the Bitcoin Cash difficulty where it is now, relative to Bitcoin and relative to the price of the two coins. In other words, Bcash miners are keeping Bcash a little less profitable to mine than Bitcoin, on purpose.\nAs we explained in our first article on this topic, miners that are driven by short-term financial incentives should all switch to the chain that is most profitable to mine (regardless of what other miners do). Yet, Bcash is still being mined despite being less profitable \u2014 and at a relatively regular pace. Blocks aren\u2019t found too fast or too slow, inflation is not out of bounds, and the situation seems relatively stable. \nIn short, miners are collectively leaving money on the table to ensure that Bcash is usable.\nThe big question, therefore, is why.\nThe simple explanation would be that the Bcash miners expect the BCH exchange rate to increase significantly in the future and are therefore willing to \u201ctake one for the team\u201d right now. (Keep in mind that even if miners believe in Bcash\u2019s long-term potential, they would individually still be better off mining BTC and selling their proceeds for BCH \u2014 but someone needs to be mining Bcash for that to even be possible.) \nAlternatively, miners could be invested in Bcash enough to want to keep it \u2014 and thus their investment \u2014 alive. Or maybe someone else is similarly invested is subsidizing the miners. \nIt could also be a matter of honor or pride. \nOr perhaps there is a bigger picture.\nThe Bitmain Factor\nTwo of the biggest Bcash miners are ViaBTC and, indeed, BTC.TOP. But the vast majority of Bcash hash power is mining anonymously to two BCH addresses. This hash power must therefore belong to one or two mystery miners, or maybe one or two mystery pools.\nMeanwhile, there is quite a bit of circumstantial evidence to suggest that Bitmain is involved with Bcash to some degree.\nFirst and foremost, Bitcoin Cash was the realization of the \u201cUAHF,\u201d a plan first proposed by Bitmain. And while the mining hardware manufacturer has publicly distanced itself from the project to some extent since, it did not rule out the possibility of supporting Bcash later on. Indeed, two of Bitmain\u2019s pools, Antpool and BTC.com, have mined BCH since.\nMeanwhile, Amaury S\u00e9chet, lead developer of Bitcoin ABC (the first software implementation that implemented this UAHF) received funding from the Bitmain-sponsored Bitcoin Development Grant. Similarly, Juan Garavaglia, CEO of early Bitcoin Cash infrastructure development company Bitprim, is or was the authorized Bitmain distributor for the U.S. and Canada. And while any connection between BTC.TOP and Bitmain has so far been denied, ViaBTC did at least receive investment from the mining giant. And of course, Bitmain co-CEO Jihan Wu established himself as a big proponent of Bcash, both online and offline. \nFurthermore, Bitmain might be one of the parties that could benefit the most from Bitcoin Cash, if the coin proves successful in the longer term. As opposed to Bitcoin, Bcash is still fully compatible with covert use of the patented AsicBoost technology that Bitmain admitted to having implemented in its chips, while Bitcoin ABC has no plans to counter this. And as Blockstream CSO Samson Mow argued, by producing their own coin, Bitmain can perhaps to some extent guarantee future hardware sales, even if Bitcoin were to ever, for example, adopt a proof-of-work algorithm change.\nAll this, and of course the fact that Bitmain is a world-leading producer of hash power, \u00a0suggests that the company is in a good position to be responsible for one or both mystery miners. Or that someone associated with the company is.\nWhile this theory is speculative and parts of it are officially denied, it would mean that Bitmain \u2014 or someone associated with Bitmain \u2014 is almost single handedly propping up Bcash. As a result, the coin is currently relatively functional. But barring more durable solutions, Bcash\u2019s future might just depend on Bitmain\u2019s willingness and ability to keep it that way.\nThanks to Johnathan Corgan for his feedback.\n", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 1}

(tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nA brand new technical conference is hitting the Bitcoin space this week.\nLoosely inspired by the well-known Scaling Bitcoin workshops, the French Bitcoin community will host the Breaking Bitcoin conference in Paris, on September 9 and 10. The conference has an explicit focus on security and is targeted at an audience with an understanding of the technical aspects of Bitcoin.\n\u201cAll of the talks and panels will have different angles that tie in to this theme,\u201d co-organizer Elizabeth Stark told Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe Breaking Bitcoin conference was born out of discussions on the CryptoFR Slack, a discussion platform for the growing developer community in France. A group of volunteers, including French Bitcoin community member Pierre Lorcery, Chainsmiths managing director Kevin Loaec and Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca, as well as California-based\u00a0Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, decided to organize the technical event.\n\u201cThe idea was simple,\u201d said Stark, who has previously been involved with organizing Scaling Bitcoin workshops. \u201cWe made a weekend out of the types of talks we see at developer meetups around the world and invited some of our favorite speakers to Paris.\u201d\nBreaking Bitcoin\u2019s focus on Bitcoin\u2019s security is unique in the space. Where Scaling Bitcoin mostly focuses on how to improve the technology in a number of ways, including scalability, fungibility, privacy, and more, Breaking Bitcoin instead highlights all the different ways in which Bitcoin can be attacked and how these attacks can be defended against.\n\u201cTalks will range from social and political attack vectors, to spam attacks, to layer 2 security, to hardware attacks, to secure and usable applications,\u201d Stark said. \u201cThis is, as far as I know, the first ever technical conference focused solely on Bitcoin security. The goal of the event is to have a true community-driven, cypherpunk conference, and our hope is that we've delivered on this.\u201d\nSpeakers and panelists in Paris include Bitcoin Core contributors Eric Lombrozo and Peter Todd, Libbitcoin developers Amir Taaki and Eric Voskuil, Lightning Network developers Dr. Christian Decker and Laolu Osuntokun, BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp, Electrum developer Thomas Voegtlin, Venture Capitalist Alyse Killeen, and many more.\nTickets start at \u20ac100 (~$120), with room for up to 300 attendees.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 4}

On the hugely popular Netflix platform, the film will give many newcomers an understandable first introduction.\nThe overall impression is that this a good historic and ideological overview of Bitcoin\u2019s first development phase but it\u2019s in need of a sequel. From its cypherpunk roots and days of early adoption, the film focuses on the digital currency\u2019s rocky relationship with the banks and regulatory bodies, setbacks like the fall of MtGox and the Silk Road, as well as some figures who were \u201cfirst through the door,\u201d like Charlie Shrem, Erik Voorhees and Gavin Andresen.\nAt the same time, Bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts are likely to find two shortcomings: First, the film dedicates too much time to stale old news like Silk Road and BitLicense, and not enough to new developments. Second, because it was first begun in late 2013 and wrapped up in the fall of 2016, the coverage of recent developments is very limited: The film essentially stops at the end of 2015.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to the film\u2019s director/writer/producer Christopher Cannucciari and associate producer Phillip Galinsky to find out more about the film\u2019s background and their future plans.\nWhat is your background, and what has been your role in the film?\nChristopher Cannucciari: I had become interested in digital currency while I was producing a 2009 documentary in Kenya and some locals had introduced me to what would become mpesa. Kenya had just had a major crisis due to post-election violence of 2008. The banks had shut down and Kenyans came up with the novel idea of texting phone credits which could be used as money to pay for goods and services. Upon my return the thought of new ways to used technology as money stuck with me. Fast forward to 2013 and my interest in Bitcoin became so strong that I decided to bring my abilities as a filmmaker to it.\nPhillip Galinsky: I\u2019ve been involved in the film since the beginning when it was just Chris working in the role of Director and myself working in the role of Producer. Chris and I were working together on an unrelated project over a three-day shoot and I kept noticing (and occasionally mentioning to other members of the production team) that the price of bitcoin was skyrocketing.\u00a0\nOthers working on the project seemed skeptical at first, but as the weekend drew on and the price nearly doubled, people became more interested. Chris and a number of other team members asked me to explain what bitcoin was and how it worked.\u00a0\nI was (and am) primarily interested in Bitcoin from a technological and moral consequentialist perspective, so I walked through the basic functions of blockchain technology, and attempted to explain how the capacity of blockchain technology to enable distributed, decentralized, censorship-resistant databases is a crucial enabling factor for development and implementation of the next generation of free and open global societies. My technical and somewhat arcane explanation turned out not to be the most effective way introduce the technology to the crew, and a number of people expressed interest in a gentler and easier to digest source of information about Bitcoin.\nChris in particular wanted to know more about Bitcoin due to previous experiences that showed him the power of technology as currency, and took note of the fact that, although Bitcoin had been around for about half a decade by then, most people still hadn\u2019t heard of it and there were few high quality resources to be found that were targeted toward informing a general audience about the technology.\u00a0\nI introduced Chris to the NYC bitcoin community and we worked together on the many components of documentary film production.\nWhat is the main message that viewers should take away?\nChristopher Cannucciari: Before the public passes judgement on Bitcoin, they deserve to know where it came from, how it works and how it fits into society.\nBitcoin didn\u2019t come from nothing, it came [off] the shoulders of the Cypherpunks. Bitcoin is a technology, and technologies are neither good nor evil, but rather [they\u2019re] accelerants. Society can use it as a tool however they see fit, and our hope is that those who wish to learn about Bitcoin will understand that it is there for them to participate as much as anyone.\nThe film doesn't cover developments after the end of 2015 (price increases in 2017, investments, DAOs, spectacular ICOs, sidechains, Lightning Networks...). I guess you had to take a long time for post processing and marketing (probably for lack of funds) between the end of shooting and the first release?\nThe story of Bitcoin is just too big to fit in a single film. Banking on Bitcoin is a primer for what Bitcoin is, where it came from and how it survived its initial challenges. As a primer, the audience can then dig in deeper and discover the many more complex stories.\nWe certainly could have tried to fit in many more stories, subjects and details, but the film would have lost its focus rather quickly. It was essential for us to honor the initiated while holding the attention of those who wanted an entry point to this amazing subject.\nVitalik Buterin appears in a couple of scenes but is never mentioned, and Ethereum is never mentioned. Why?\nChristopher Cannucciari: I held interviews with Vitalik in Toronto, Wences Casares in Silicon Valley and even traveled to the Bitcoin Bowl in Florida. As much as I wish I could have kept these stories in the film, we had to keep focus on what was unfolding before us in New York.\nEthereum deserves its own story and perhaps we can find a way to tell that story in the future.\nYou often mention the tension between the original libertarian, crypto-anarchist spirit of Bitcoin and its new \"sanitized\" mainstream aspects, Ben Lawsky's regulations and Blythe Masters' Wall Street blockchains. What's your own take?\nChristopher Cannucciari: The Crypto scene in New York was amazingly vibrant and the state had a golden opportunity to foster it and give New York the same innovative energy Silicon Valley had in the 1980s. What happened instead is Bitcoin was eyed with suspicion and the regulations around it made it difficult for \u201cgarage\u201d entrepreneurs to participate. It is now left to those who can afford to work with the regulators.\nPhillip Galinsky: There are both positive and negative consequences of the adoption of blockchain technology by \u201cWall Street.\u201d All blockchain development, both open and closed source, has the positive consequence of informing developers about the limitations and capacities of the technology. Open source endeavors produce the most accessible and immediately useful technologies to facilitate further blockchain invention and innovation. However, even closed-source development produces valuable knowledge about the possible uses of blockchain technology; for example, this white paper released by Blythe Masters\u2019 firm Digital Asset Holdings which goes into great depth about one of the many possible uses of blockchain technology.\nThis is not to say that all blockchain based systems will be positive or bear normative value from a moral consequentialist perspective. Blockchain technology is incredibly powerful and will shape the future of human interaction and societal system architectures, for better or worse, and it is largely on the shoulder of developers to ensure that the blockchain is used to increase well-being in the world.\u00a0\nIs the end meant to suggest that Craig Wright is Satoshi? What is your own bet? Who is Satoshi?\nChristopher Cannucciari: It\u2019s very interesting how this is a sensitive issue. Craig Wright was presented in the same way as Dorian [Nakamoto] was. The carousel of Satoshi\u2019s identity will continue; Wright will not be the last to come forward.\nWhile Wright is most certainly not Satoshi, some have suggested that he was a drop for the real Satoshi. The timing was interesting, Wright was in need of capital to settle some big debts and all of a sudden he was in possession of some valuable, early Satoshi-era Bitcoins. For those who want to play the Satoshi game, I added this breadcrumb to keep the search on.\nThe Bitcoin/blockchain story is far from over. Are you working on a sequel to the film, and what role does blockchain technology play in your future work?\nPhillip Galinsky: There will certainly be an ever-increasing wealth of material for filmmakers to cover in the blockchain space in coming years, as many of the most exciting developments in blockchain technology \u2014 self-executing contracts, oracles, distributed autonomous organizations, and most fascinating to me, blockchain-based societal control systems \u2014 are still in the nascent stages of development and implementation. Chris and I have discussed the possibility of making a sequel; however, we haven\u2019t made any specific plans to do so at this point in time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 1}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nAfter a years-long development process and even more debate and political struggle, Segregated Witness finally activated on the Bitcoin network last week. The protocol upgrade introduced a number of benefits which can enable more advanced second-layer protocols. It also offers a block size limit increase for wallets that utilize the new feature, meaning users can enjoy lower fees and faster confirmation times.\nOne week in, Segregated Witness has been implemented in several wallets, though overall adoption is off to a bit of a slow start. While many wallets and services indicated prior to the activation that they would be ready for the upgrade, many are taking a bit of a conservative approach when it comes to main-net release, while others have since faced unrelated difficulties that demanded their attention.\nSo far, hardware wallets are among the first to have jumped on the new opportunity. Both Trezor and Ledger have fully implemented and enabled Segregated Witness. This is not very surprising: Hardware wallets stand to benefit from SegWit more than most wallets, as it helps to significantly speedup the signing process.\n\u201cBut we mostly implemented Segregated Witness to help the network first,\u201d Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe more Segregated Witness transactions are used, the more space there is for everybody. In a way we\u2019re also doing our part to disarm the 2x part of the SegWit2x hard fork.\u201d\nAnother hardware wallet provider, Digital Bitbox, also implemented Segregated Witness in its firmware, cofounder and Bitcoin Core contributor Jonas Schnelli told Bitcoin Magazine, but it still requires a compatible desktop app to utilize the feature. This is a work in progress.\nFull node wallets like Bitcoin Core are also in the process of implementing Segregated Witness. But Bitcoin Core developers decided to not include the feature straight away in order to avoid edge-case attacks that become harder to execute as time passes. Bitcoin Core will instead release a new version of the software, 0.15.1; this could take another month or two before it\u2019s available.\nAs for regular wallets, it seems that Blockstream\u2019s GreenAddress could well be the first to offer the feature.\n\u201cIt's days away,\u201d GreenAddress developer Lawrence Nahum told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe were ready a while back; however, during testing we found that fees were a bit higher in one of our wallets. That\u2019s because some software libraries available now weren\u2019t available when we implemented SegWit. At this point it\u2019s mostly a matter of more testing.\u201d\nMost other wallets are also in various stages of implementing the feature, but for various reasons haven\u2019t gotten to the point of release quite yet. In some cases, like BitGo and BTC.com, this had to do with the prioritization of integrating Bitcoin Cash into their service; the new cryptocurrency launched unexpectedly only a couple of weeks ago. Similarly, Mycelium told Bitcoin Magazine it has been implementing new features which diverted some time and attention away from SegWit.\nOther popular wallets, including Bitcoin Wallet (also known as Schildbach\u2019s Bitcoin Wallet), Breadwallet, Electrum, mSIGNA, as well as webwallet Xapo confirmed that they are implementing SegWit, and all told Bitcoin Magazine that they expect this should be available soon \u2014 though none gave a specific timeframe for it.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 1}

But, in Europe, investors already have a bitcoin-backed, exchange-traded product available via a public exchange such as the NASDAQ OMX. \u00a0\nIn May of 2015, \u00a0Sweden\u2019s XBT Provider AB announced the authorization of Bitcoin Tracker One, the first Bitcoin-based security available on a regulated exchange. In October of the same year, it launched Euro-denominated Bitcoin-based security, Bitcoin Tracker EUR, available through Nasdaq Nordic.\nLast week, Danish investors were given access to these ETNs, both Bitcoin Tracker One and Bitcoin Tracker EUR, via Copenhagen-based Saxo Bank. Similarly, the U.K.'s largest online trading platform, Hargreaves Lansdown, also gave investors access to Bitcoin ETNs this year.\nXBT Provider is the issuer of the two Exchange Traded Notes (COINXBE & COINXBT), backed by bitcoin on Nasdaq OMX in Stockholm. Functionally, this means that XBT Provider issues certificates which track the price of bitcoin for delivery to investors who purchase the certificates on NASDAQ OMX. In June 2016, XBT Provider was acquired by asset management firm Global Advisors (Jersey).\nXBT Provider is then responsible for ensuring that these certificates accurately mirror (with minimal tracking error) the price movement of the BTC/SEK and BTC/EUR exchange rate by purchasing bitcoin and storing it.\nThe notes offer investors a familiar route to gain exposure to the price movements of bitcoin without having to purchase or secure the bitcoin themselves.\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Ryan Radloff, head of investor relations at XBT provider, discussed their Bitcoin ETN gave a look ahead at what may be in store for the future. \n\nWhat is an exchange traded note?\nExchange Traded Notes are debt backed securities which offer investors exposure to the change in value of the underlying currency. In the case of XBT Provider, the strategy is to track the price movement of the BTC/SEK and BTC/EUR exchange rate. ETNs are usually listed on public exchanges and thus available for purchase via any broker with access to the listing exchange, in our case, NASDAQ OMX.\nWhy purchase a bitcoin ETN over regular bitcoin?\nThere are three major reasons to consider a bitcoin ETN over physical bitcoin. \n1) Security \u2013 When you invest in bitcoin via an ETN, you are not responsible for ensuring the security of the bitcoin. \n2) Speed and Convenience: The route to purchasing an ETN is via a familiar broker or brokerage platform and the ETN is listed on a trusted exchange. No new accounts are needed, no new verification steps required. So this means the ETN is often the fastest way to purchase exposure to bitcoin, presuming you do not yet have an account with a crypto-currency exchange. \n3) Potential Tax Advantages \u2013 In the UK for instance, the bitcoin ETN is uniquely eligible for inclusion in a tax-advantaged SIPP account thus this type of investment in bitcoin may experience a more efficient tax treatment than simply purchasing bitcoin outright.\nIs the product limited to a certain type of investor?\nThe access to the product is governed by your stock broker. First your broker needs to be able to offer access to NASDAQ OMX. Second, your broker needs to authorize you for trading such an instrument. Currently, this product is not available for offer to U.S. investors.\nHow has XBT Provider performed since launching?\nPrice is directly correlated with the movement in price of the bitcoin. Since the price of bitcoin was in the $200s when we launched and is currently over $4800, performance has been exceptional.\nAny interested investor can find more information at XBTProvider.com or can contact their broker directly to find out whether they have access to the product. As with any investment decision, investors should perform their own due diligence and understand the risks associated with this (young) asset class prior to investing. \n\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 4}
{"title": "SONM: A Universal \u2018Fog Supercomputer\u2019 Powered by the Ethereum Blockchain", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/sonm-universal-fog-supercomputer-powered-ethereum-blockchain/", "birthday": "Sep 5, 2017  12:49 PM EST", "date": "2017-09-05 17:49:00", "content": "A frequently heard critique of blockchain technology is that mining is a power-intensive process that consumes energy, generates heat and damages the environment for the sole purpose of maintaining the blockchain. On one hand, maintaining an open and secure blockchain is important and, therefore, worth the energy it costs to maintain it. On the other hand, perhaps the energy spent can be partly redirected toward other important applications.\nSONM (Supercomputer Organized by Network Mining) is an ambitious project that wants to turn mining computers into nodes of a worldwide supercomputer able to tackle demanding, resource-intensive computing tasks of any nature. And it is betting on the second approach.\nAccording to the SONM white paper, \u201cSONM is a decentralized worldwide fog supercomputer for general purpose computing from site hosting to scientific calculations.\u201d Fog computing can be seen as a distributed form of cloud computing where computing tasks are not sent to large remote data centers but farmed to more localized networks of end-user devices.\n\u201cFrom a technical point of view, SONM is a top layer of underlying P2P technologies: BTSync for data transfer, Cocaine open source PaaS technology as a decentralized computing platform, and Ethereum Smart Contracts as a consensus system,\u201d notes the white paper.\nThe SONM platform uses a token of the same name \u2014 SONM (ticker SNM) \u2014 on the Ethereum blockchain. An SNM presale launched on the 15th of April and was successfully completed in less than 12 hours, raising 10,000 ETH. On June 18, SONM announced that the SNM crowdsale had reached its $42 million cap, closing just four days into the sale. SNM tokens are now listed on exchanges including HitBTC and EtherDelta.\nThe SONM business model is based on the fact that the computing market has enjoyed double-digit growth every year for the past several years and, according to the SONM team, fog computing is more cost efficient and faster than cloud services. \nSONM wants to be an aggregator, providing a P2P marketplace to connect end users to fog computing service providers. \u201cMining\" is considered to be any computing work that fog computing service providers \u2014 or \u201cminers\u201d \u2014 \u00a0do to execute a task. In return for their work, miners are rewarded with SONM tokens which they can use to pay for other services on the platform or cash out on exchanges. Thus, end users can save time and money using the SONM network to run their tasks and miners can lend their unused computing power and generate revenue through running tasks on their machines.\nPaolo Tasca, a digital economist and blockchain expert, recently joined the SONM Advisory Board. Tasca is the Executive Director of the Centre for Blockchain Technologies at University College London, as well as a blockchain consultant to the United Nations and EU Parliament, and the co-editor of \u201cBanking Beyond Banks and Money: A Guide to Banking Services in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d\n\u201cWe have reached the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another,\u201d said Tasca. \u201cNew technologies are dramatically transforming our society into something very different from what we were used to thinking about over the last few decades. The possibilities that have been unlocked by billions of people and smart devices collectively connected\u200a \u2014 with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge\u200a \u2014 are vast.\u201d\n\u201cBy 2025, most of Earth\u2019s population, will be online and by 2030, the Internet of Things will comprise 100 billion connected devices,\u201d continued Tasca. \u201cUnder this extraordinary wave of connectivity and digital transformation, SONM distributed cloud technology will allow processing a nearly infinite amount of data streamed from a world of sensors and connected devices that will envelop our business and private lives, changing products and habits.\u201d\nAccording to Tasca, while cloud computing offers several advantages such as ubiquitous on-demand or metered and self-service access to computing resources, it presents shortcomings as well including:\nlimited bandwidth and service outages, security and privacy, vulnerability to attacks, limited control and flexibility, cloud computing platform dependencies, and comparatively higher costs.\n\u201cFog computing, also sometimes called edge computing, aims to solve most of the cloud computing disadvantages by keeping data closer \u2018to the ground,\u2019 in local computers and devices, rather than routing everything through a central data center in the cloud,\u201d Tasca told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cFog computing allows for data to be processed more rapidly and accessed more efficiently from the most logical location, which reduces the risk of data latency.\u201d\nWhile cloud technologies require trusted infrastructure, centralized governance and orchestration, fog technologies work independently of centralized authority. According to Tasca, SONM fog technologies could become an integral part of the future Internet of Things (IoT), with multiple SONM nodes automatically downloading and executing tasks from the market place.\nA \u201ckiller\u201d feature of SONM is its ability to \u201cprovide IaaS [Infrastructure as a Service] for almost any current cryptocurrency startup or ICO project,\u201d said Tasca. \u201cWe can host Ethereum miners or even full nodes, or Storj clients, or whatever. All those startups are competing for users\u2019 computers. SONM can be a platform for all of them. From a user perspective, this gives the ability to swiftly switch between multiple projects with a click of a mouse. Install SONM and turn your computer or mining rig into a test polygon to run different apps.\u201d\nAccording to Tasca, there are several key features of SONM including the ability to buy and sell general purpose computing power on the open market and to make these payments with cryptocurrency. Global IaaS allows users to acquire sizeable pools of resources at will for a desired time period without obligations to renew. \nAt the moment, the SONM computing power marketplace supports only simple bid/ask orders but more sophisticated features are planned. \u201cNext steps are derivative instruments, such as options and futures,\u201d said Tasca.\nIt also allows for the development of truly decentralized, scalable, general purpose applications in a PaaS [Platform as a Service] environment. For miners, SONM gives them the ability to use mining equipment to accept and execute the computing tasks for which there is more demand.\nSONM vs iExec\niExec (I Execute) is a distributed GRID computing platform somewhat similar to SONM. GRID computing distributes demanding High Performance Computing (HPC) applications across participating computing nodes. The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid, is a high-profile example of this sort of HPC project. It is led by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, and is dedicated to processing data produced by Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments at CERN. \nAccording to Tasca, SONM\u2019s fog computing concept is more flexible.\n\u201cThe key difference is that iExec is for GRID [computing], while SONM is for general computing,\u201d explained Tasca. \u201cSONM can run both deterministic and non-deterministic tasks. A non-deterministic algorithm is an algorithm that exhibits different behaviors on different runs, even on the same input, as opposed to a deterministic algorithm. The non-deterministic algorithm, then, can be used to process non-deterministic tasks that need continuously different behavior patterns, like video streaming, while deterministic algorithms suit deterministic tasks that need precise scientific calculations, like bioinformatics.\u201d\nThe concept of a non-deterministic algorithm could sound self-contradictory and even oxymoronic, but Tasca went on to explain how it is used in the SONM context. A deterministic task will produce the same output if it is launched on different machines, possibly at different times. If two machines running a deterministic task produce results that don't match, then one machine may be malfunctioning or its owner may be cheating.\nUnder the SONM paradigm, a non-deterministic task is a task wherein its definition and input is not completely defined by its owner. \u201cIt means that, while execution will take place, the task will look for or accept additional information from an outer scope. For example, if a task internally makes use of random numbers, or it is serving external requests (not defined by the task owner), then the task results may differ. If you launch such a task on two machines, the results may vary.\u201d\nFor example, a web server produces results that depend on the HTTP requests received, and those requests are not part of the task definition. Similarly, a game server can use light tracing simulations driven by random numbers.\n\n\u201cThe SONM network not only processes scientific calculations for projects like drug development, bioinformatics and aerodynamics,\u201d concluded Tasca, \u201cthe system can also deal with non-deterministic projects, from site hosting to game servers. This latter aspect makes the SONM network a universal tool for running computing tasks of whatever difficulty.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 5}

However, Kymriah costs $475,000 for one single treatment, Bloomberg reports, which is well beyond being affordable for average patients.\nIn the U.S., the FDA approval process itself adds billions of dollars to drug development costs, which pharmaceutical companies must then recover, and also adds years to the drug availability timeline. The impression that suffering U.S. patients are required to pay exorbitant drug prices to support over-regulation is difficult to escape.\nTo operate beyond the reach of FDA regulations, Peter Thiel and other libertarian investors are funding an offshore human clinical trial of a herpes vaccine, TechCrunch reports. Thiel\u2019s move has caused a stormy debate with clashes between opposite positions. See, for example, the opposite takes of DailyBeast and Reason.\nThere are many other examples of the harmful effects of over-regulation in the health sector, but these matters of life and death are too serious to be used for a political point. However, other sectors can illustrate the ethical and economical problems of over-regulation.\nTake, for example, internet gambling, which is illegal in many jurisdictions including the U.S.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that internet gambling is hugely popular, and the sector moves a lot of money. The ethical objection to making internet gambling illegal is easy to formulate: The adult citizens who want to gamble their own money online should be free to do so.\nThe economical objection is also easy to formulate: Adult citizens who want to gamble their own money online will find ways to do so, by using offshore service providers if there\u2019s none at home or by going through Tor or a VPN if needed. But, if online gambling providers are forced to move offshore, they'll take a lot of jobs and a lot of money with them.\nThis is exactly what has happened in the online gambling sector, with many U.S. providers migrating to more gambling-friendly jurisdictions such as the U.K. Similarly, the Isle of Man government recognized internet gambling as a potential strategic growth sector and established a suitable legal and fiscal framework to attract online gambling and sports betting businesses. As a result, leading operators flocked to the island.\nSince those U.S. residents who want to gamble online will do so anyway, the only effect of over-regulating the industry is to take money, jobs and technology offshore. \nActually, this is not entirely correct: Besides moving offshore, the less scrupulous operators also have the option of moving underground. In that case, it would force those who want to engage in totally harmless gambling to deal with a shady or even criminal underworld, which can be dangerous. This same point, which seems perfectly logical, is often made in support of drug liberalization. \nCrypto Innovation Takes the Path of Least Resistance\nAfter having introduced light and relatively permissive regulations to attract internet gambling operators, the Isle of Man adopted the same strategy for cryptocurrencies and digital fintech. Switzerland is following on the same path, with the \u201cCrypto Valley\u201d near Zug attracting more and more crypto-fintech operators.\nInitial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales are a relatively new crypto-fintech phenomenon that is attracting lots of attention from the press, from old and new businesses, and now from the regulators. \nIn July, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a first ruling which outlined that some tokens are to be considered as securities and subjected to rather strict SEC regulations. Other regulatory authorities, such as the Canadian Securities Administrators, are considering plans to follow suit.\nOn Monday, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) and Chinese regulatory bodies banned and deemed illegal the practice of raising funds through crypto-token ICOs, as reported by Reuters. This seems to conflict with recent, much more reasonable statements from the Director of PBoC\u2019s Digital Currency Research Institute, which could indicate internal disagreement.\nThe regulators are mainly concerned with protecting gullible citizens from scams, which are inevitably common in the ICO scene. Perhaps the Chinese regulators are just temporarily freezing ICOs until they have a chance to put a sound regulatory framework in place. But it can be argued that, if their intention truly is to ban ICOs outright, then regulators are overreacting in ways that deny useful options to businesses and citizens alike.\nAccording to the SEC and the CSA, only tokens with an underlying utility rather than a speculative investment value alone can escape being considered as securities. But, as always, the devil is in the details. If a token is really useful, its market value will go up, and speculative investors will profit. The question that comes to mind is, at which point does a useful token become a speculative investment? According to specialized lawyers, \u201cthe SEC has not provided a clear answer.\u201d\n\u201cObviously not everything that appreciates in value is a security,\u201d notes crypto investor and CEO of 21.co, Balaji Srinivasan, in an insightful CNBC interview. \u201cFor example, a house can appreciate in value, but you can (and many people do) buy it for the use value.\u201d But regulators could be tempted to follow China\u2019s lead and consider all useful tokens as securities, which seems to be dangerous overkill.\nThe SEC regulations restrict investing in privately offered securities to \u201caccredited investors.\u201d But less than 10 percent of households in the U.S. are wealthy enough to qualify as such, and there are other strict requirements as well.\nTherefore, if all useful tokens are considered as securities, the ability for creators of value to raise funds is significantly hampered, and average citizens are denied the opportunity to bet on innovative projects that could offer significant returns.\nIt\u2019s now to be expected that Chinese crypto-token initiatives, including those that are not scams but are really innovative and promising projects, will move offshore and take jobs and money with them. Similarly, should U.S. crypto regulations become more restrictive, many U.S. companies could be tempted to follow the example of Xapo and relocate to Switzerland. Last week, blockchain company ShapeShift announced its decision to leave the State of Washington due to local over-regulation.\nSrinivasan\u2019s well-argued thesis is that crypto-tokens will democratize investment, open new fundraising options to businesses and new investment options to the public \u2014 including small businesses and average citizens \u2014 and turn the internet into the world's largest \u201cstock\u201d market.\n\u201cThe regulatory framework will likely eventually accommodate this,\u201d concludes Srinivasan. \u201cOnly a few countries need to allow it, and the consequent creation of wealth will be so large that it'll push many of the rest to have a liberal tokenization regime as well.\u201d\nThe regulators should take this wise advice into account in formulating reasonable policies for the crypto-token sector, as well as the other sectors mentioned above.", "year": 2017, "month": 9, "day": 6}

After an initial drop to the $330s, the ETH-USD market suffered another blow as China announced it will be banning ICOs and conducting rigorous investigations into several of the newer coins such as NEO and OMG. This announcement from the Chinese government prompted several large Chinese exchanges to begin delisting coins under investigation. After all was said and done, the drop to $280 marked a 38% retracement since ETH-USD bull run from $130 to $400 values:\nFigure 1: ETH-USD, 4-Hour Candles, GDAX, Macro Bull Run\nAfter seeing the test of the macro 38% Fibonacci Retracement values (shown above), the ETH-USD markets managed to bounce to the 23% retracement values. At the time of this article, the market is currently finding support at 23% retracement but the steam to continue a sustained bull run is waning.\nLooking closely at the current trend, we can see a potential bearish continuation pattern called a \u201cBear Flag\u201d:\nFigure 2: ETH-USD, 4-Hour Candles, GDAX, Potential Bear Flag\nA Bear Flag is a bearish continuation pattern that is characterized by higher highs, higher lows, and decreasing volume. Bear Flags are found at the bottom of bear runs and are sometimes referred to as \u201cBull Traps\u201d because bullish traders are often caught in these patterns by mistaking the rally for a macro trend reversal. \nTypically, the Bear Flag is formed by strong bullish traders buying what they predict is the bottom of the bear run. The initial purchasing power of the bulls begins to push out the bears who either wish to take profit or were late to the bear run \u2014 this is called a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d \nHowever, one key characteristic to watch out for in trends like this is the drastically decreasing volume throughout the length of the run. The decrease in volume essentially shows the lack of buyers in the market as the price begins to climb, level out and ultimately reverse.\nTo calculate where the potential price target of this Bear Flag is, we must first calculate the \u201cpole length\u201d of the flag:\nFigure 3: ETH-USD, 4-Hour Candles, GDAX, Bear Flag Pole Length\nIf this pattern breaks down and proves to be a successful Bear Flag, we can expect to see an approximate $90 move downward from the point of breakout. In our case, we could expect a retest of the of the 38% Fibonacci Retracement values ultimately leading to a test of the 50% retracement values shown in Figure 1. \nAs always, it is paramount to confirm the trend before trading it. Although Bear Flags are strong patterns and tend to have a high degree of success among some of the more seasoned traders, it is entirely possible the market could see a flood of volume to propel the price higher; alternatively, the price could simply level off and consolidate sideways. There is no rule that states \u201cthe market must continue downward.\u201d However, for those looking to trade this pattern, it is advisable to wait for a downward price movement to be confirmed with strong, bearish volume. \nFigure 4: ETH-USD, 1-Day Candles, GDAX\nZooming out to the 1-day candles, we see indications that a sustained bear market could be in store for ETH-USD. The 1-day candles reveal a bearish MACD with no clear signs of divergence (bearish momentum loss). A bearish macro MACD and waning volume on the lower timescales is a great indication of a potential prolonged bearish continuation.\nSummary:\nChina announced a ban on ICOs and began delisting several newer coins from their major exchanges.There are macro and micro signs that a bearish continuation could be in store for ETH-USD.Should the Bear Flag break to the bottom, we can expect a test of the mid-$200s.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

According to IBM, there are multiple reasons for this issue, including students taking online courses and attending universities abroad. Such \u201cnon-traditional methods\u201d can create confusion for the employers; however, IBM believes implementing blockchain technology will resolve the issue. The learning platform will give both the teachers and the students a digital, trusted record showing their accomplishments, which can be \u2014 thanks to the nature of blockchain technology \u2014 easily verified by future employers or educational institutions.\n\u201cBlockchain technology has the potential to impact systems in a wide variety of industries, and the educational sphere is no exception when educational data is securely stored on the blockchain and shared among permissioned users. We are pleased that we have worked together with IBM to build a new system which can help effect real change in the education sector,\u201d Masaaki Isozu, President of Sony Global Education, said in a statement.\nThe system\u2019s work is simple: student data will be recorded by the platform and shared with \u201cneed-to-know parties,\u201d including future employers and school administrators. Since the learning platform will be using the IBM Blockchain, every piece of data can be verified by the parties. \nSchools, colleges and universities can also share the data to help teachers identify and implement unique teaching methods for each student based on the information on the blockchain. The learning platform will also collect all related information and place it in a single repository, which will allow the reliable sharing of digital transcripts.

Representatives from IBM Japan confirmed to Bitcoin Magazine that these vendors include private preparatory schools and cram schools (institutions specialized in training students to reach certain goals). The only data provided to the vendors are the study results of the students. The students or their parents will maintain access control for the students\u2019 study results. \n\u201cBlockchain [technology] offers a new approach to how the lifetime history of data related to a person, place or thing is shared and managed.

Blockchain technology and AI will be supplemented with curation by subject matter experts.\nFounder and project lead Colin Pape, who previously launched the e-commerce site ShopCity.com, said:\n\u201cWhile Google is generally thought of as a neutral entity for search, the company answers to Wall Street and operates very secretively. \n\u201cThey\u2019ve become known for promoting themselves at the expense of alternatives and appropriating others\u2019 information, blaming it on \u2018the algorithm.\u2019 The reality is that they manipulate results and justify changes as being best for the user.\u201d \nPape wants to provide a community-driven, decentralized, open and transparent alternative to Google, in contrast to what he calls the \u201cmanipulated algorithm-driven methods standard among today\u2019s industry giants.\u201d \nPape told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cPresearch will use a combination of human curation by subject matter experts who are rewarded with tokens, and machine learning technology and APIs from other search providers (particularly for long-tail searches).\u201d\nPape told us they will be using the Ethereum Blockchain ERC20 standard to start but may build their own blockchain technology at some point down the road.\nOpenness, Accountability and Community Participation\nThe company\u2019s white paper emphasizes that never in the history of the world has so much information been concentrated in so few hands. It also points out that Google makes $100 billion in annual revenue from search engine searches.\nPresearch estimates that 77 percent of global desktop searches and 96 percent of mobile searches, more than 5 billion queries per day, go to Google.\nThe white paper states that Google has built up an unprecedented degree of trust with users with \u201ctheir simple interfaces, lightning-fast response times and utter reliability, combined with what appear to be amazingly accurate results.\u201d\nA Search Engine Wikipedia\nPresearch believes that a decentralized, community-based decision-making process ensures everyone\u2019s interests are considered. By rewarding members for using, promoting and contributing to the Presearch platform, the company wants to create a scalable \u201cWikipedia for search\u201d to allow members to curate the best content for each inquiry.\nThe Presearch community can also vote on and fund new development projects, continually upgrading the platform.\nPape added: \u201cWith Presearch, I wanted to flip that business model on its head and put power over information back into the hands of all internet users.\u201d\n\nSearch is the gateway to the web. The world deserves an alternative search engine that is open, transparent, and that involves the community in product development, consensus and quality control.\nFunding\nPresearch\u2019s curation and overall development of the platform is incentivized with the Presearch Token (PST).\nPresearch has run three separate crowd sales for $1 million, $1.5 million and $3 million in token revenue. There are three more sales to go that are targeted to generate more than $30 million in total revenue.\nThe startup is headquartered in Midland, north of Toronto, Canada. A \u201cdistributed\u201d team is located in Silicon Valley, Boulder, Colorado and the Atlanta area, and the company is planning to expand internationally.\nAdvisors to Presearch include internet innovator, Rich Skrenta, who sold his search engine Blekko to IBM Watson; open-source search innovator Trey Grainger, SVP of Engineering at Lucidworks; and technology lawyer Addison Cameron-Huff, whose experience includes working with Ethereum\u2019s founding team.\nBitcoin Magazine contacted Google for comment but has not yet received a response.", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 17}

However, this time, the momentum to continue higher seems to be waning. Shortly after establishing the new all-time high, there was a $150 flash crash that sprang a series of account liquidations across several exchanges in a move that would ultimately \u201clong squeeze\u201d the market. A long squeeze is a term used to describe the sudden cascade of long positions getting stopped out of their positions, causing market orders to propel the price even lower:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 5-Minute Candles, Bitfinex, Long Squeeze\nThe figure above shows the price movement correlated to the volume during the $150 drop. Halfway through the drop we see a sudden spike in sell volume. This spike in volume is the beginning of the \u201clong squeeze\u201d that initiated the cascade of market sell orders caused by traders in long positions being forced out of their positions via their stop-loss market orders.\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 15-Minute Candles, Bitfinex, Short Squeeze\nYesterday, at around 12 pm EST, the exact opposite thing happened in a market event known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d You can think of a short squeeze as literally the opposite of a long squeeze: People who are anticipating a great short entry are suddenly forced out of their positions via their stop-loss orders, and market buy orders propel the market higher, thus triggering more stop-loss orders until the market equalizes.\nToday the BTC-USD market has begun a series of long squeezes that pulled the price down by $300 in a matter of hours, and it doesn\u2019t show much sign of letting up at the moment. Let\u2019s take a look at the macro trend and see where the market is likely heading:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 3-Day Candles, Bitfinex\nFor the fifth candle in a row, the 3-day candles have managed to puncture the Bollinger Bands in a move that indicates an overbought market. We have yet to see an attempt to move within the Bollinger Bands and provide some relief for the high price range. \nZooming in a little closer, we can see that clear signs of bullish exhaustion formed as we began to push the most recent set of all-time highs:\nFigure 4: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Bullish Exhaustion\nThe first thing that pops out about this trend is the decrease in volume (shown in pink) leading into this morning\u2019s all-time high. Upon reaching that high, sell volume began to pick up considerably (labeled in blue) and has continued to remain strong during the push into the $4300 and $4200 prices. The previous all-time highs (labeled in yellow) are currently paired with a decreasing MACD moving average/signal line trend that indicates the market is losing bullish momentum across the macro trend. \nThe BTC-USD market seems to be running on fumes at the moment, but I would not \u00a0be surprised at all to see an all-time high squeezed out of this market. However, I would be VERY surprised if that all time had any notable follow-through. The market volume on the macro levels has steadily declined, and there are key market indicators that hint toward the need for sustained sideways consolidation. Alternatively, a strong market pullback might be in the cards for BTC-USD. Each push toward the new highs has been greeted by strong sell volume. In the event of a market retracement, your key support levels on the macro exist along the Fibonacci Retracements shown below:\nFigure 5: BTC-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Key Support Levels\nWhen the market begins to struggle to push new all-time highs, it is important to keep a close eye on the volume and see how it interacts with the price movement. Consistent price growth on decreasing buy volume is a signal that the bears, although losing the battle in price currently, are gathering as the market nears its final top before ultimately correcting or consolidating. And given the price growth over the past 30 days, I would be inclined to lean toward the former rather than the latter.\nSummary:\nShort squeezes and long squeezes have begun to shape the current market trend.On the macro and micro scale, the market is showing a highly overbought market and is beginning to lose upward steam.Key support levels lie on the Fibonacci Retracements shown in Figure 5.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe Bitcoin community is not taking kindly to BitPay this week. Influential developers are accusing the major payment processor of fraud, Bitcoin users on social media are calling for boycots, bitcoin.org is removing recommendations of the company\u2019s products, and NBitcoin developer Nicolas Dorier has launched an initiative to fork some of BitPay\u2019s projects altogether.\nHere\u2019s why.\nBitcore\nThe controversial issue has to do with Bitcore.\nBitcore is a type of Bitcoin node developed by BitPay. It is specifically designed to offer a development platform, on top of which it is easy to build all kinds of Bitcoin applications. Anyone can use this open-source tool; some of the better-known applications that utilize it include video-streaming service Streamium, Trezor\u2019s web interface and BitPay\u2019s own Copay wallet.\nWithin the next a couple of days, most likely on August 23, the long-awaited Bitcoin protocol upgrade Segregated Witness (SegWit) will activate. Seemingly in response to this upgrade, BitPay published a blog post titled What Bitcore Users Need to Know to Be Ready for SegWit Activation\nBut not everyone is happy with the contents of this blog post\u2026\nThe \u201cMajor Risk\u201d That Is (or Isn\u2019t) SegWit\nThe first problem is not the most important problem, but it is worth mentioning, regardless. It concerns the topic of the blog post itself: Segregated Witness.\nIn the blog post, BitPay states:\nNodes which fail to upgrade to support SegWit will face major security risks, including the risk of double-spend transaction fraud.\nThis appears to be a bit of an exaggeration.\nSegregated Witness is specifically designed to be backwards compatible. Regular nodes that do not upgrade remain part of the Bitcoin network. And importantly, since SegWit was activated by a unanimous hash-power majority, all miners should be enforcing the new rules. As such, transactions that are invalid according the new rules should never be accepted in any Bitcoin blocks at all. Even non-upgraded nodes should never see these invalid transactions confirm. \nIt is true that \u2014 like every other soft fork before SegWit \u2014 there are some increased risks for non-upgraded nodes. And in an additional blog post, BitPay does provide more details and nuance regarding the situation.\nBut the somewhat alarmist tone of the first blog post seems a bit unnecessary. Therefore, to many it appears to have had the specific goal of pushing users toward a software upgrade for very different reasons. \nWhich brings us to the next point\u2026\nThe \u201cUpgrade\u201d That Is (or Isn\u2019t) Bitcoin\nWhile BitPay\u2019s alarmist tone seemed like an unnecessary means, it\u2019s the end that really ticked so many people off.\nAs per the \u201cNew York Agreement,\u201d a significant group of Bitcoin companies, mining pools and individuals plans to adopt an incompatible set of protocol rules by November. Dubbed \u201cSegWit2x,\u201d and implemented in the BTC1 software developed by former Bitcoin Core contributor Jeff Garzik, this project would \u201chard fork\u201d an increase of Bitcoin\u2019s block weight limit, allowing for blocks of up to eight megabytes. (Whether this should technically be called a hard fork\u00a0or an\u00a0altcoin is debatable, but never mind that for now.)\nThe problem is that, while a significant group of Bitcoin companies \u2014 including, indeed, BitPay \u2014 signed on to the New York Agreement, this agreement currently does not have industry-wide consensus. Most notably, Bitcoin\u2019s development community has almost unanimously rejected the proposal. There is also a long list of companies that never signed onto the initiative in the first place; in fact, some of them are actively opposed to it. And more informal metrics, like social media sentiment, opinion polls and network node count generally also show limited support for SegWit2x.\nAs such, it is likely that SegWit2x would split off to create a new blockchain and currency, not unlike what Bitcoin Cash (Bcash) did. Unlike Bcash, however, SegWit2x currently has no intention of picking a new name, nor does it plan to implement safety precautions like replay protection. (Replay protection would prevent the \u201csame\u201d coin from accidentally being spent on both chains.) For all intents and purposes, the companies behind SegWit2x appear to be set to claim this coin is the \u201creal\u201d Bitcoin, while the coin that follows the current Bitcoin protocol won\u2019t be.\nThis approach is controversial. Many Bitcoin users that do not support the hard fork may prefer to keep using Bitcoin as is, without worrying about added (replay) risks or other inconveniences caused by SegWit2x. And if two different coins claim the name \u201cBitcoin,\u201d it could lead to much confusion, for obvious reasons.\nRegardless, in BitPay\u2019s blog post, which speaks of an \u201cupgrade\u201d for Bitcore users in preparation for SegWit, the payment processor actually directs readers to download the BTC1 software; that is, the software that embeds the SegWit2x protocol, rather than the current Bitcoin protocol. It therefore appeared that the company was really trying to get Bitcore users to switch to a whole new coin, which BitPay will consider \u201cBitcoin.\u201d And the payment processor initially did so without so much as warning Bitcore users that following these instructions would make them incompatible with the current Bitcoin protocol by November. \nHerein lies the concern: BitPay must have known that this advice is controversial. Failing to mention the risks or consequences made the blog post seem deceptive.\nThe Hash Power That Supports (or Doesn\u2019t Support) SegWit2x\nFinally, after BitPay faced initial blowback for its blog post for reasons described, it included an addendum. In it, the payment processor writes:\n[O]ur instructions follow this version of Bitcoin because over 95% of Bitcoin miners have adopted Segwit2x.\nWhile this addendum provides a little bit more clarity, it is once again a bit of a questionable statement.\nPerhaps most importantly: If BTC1 indeed hard forks in November, BitPay right now has no way of knowing how much hash power will really be mining on the SegWit2x chain. \nWhile it is true that mining pools currently representing a supermajority of hash power signed on to the New York Agreement, mining pools usually don\u2019t have full control over the hash power that is pointed toward their pools. Much of this hash power actually belongs to individual miners (\u201chashers\u201d), who could switch to a new pool with the click of a few buttons. (For example, when another mining pool, Ghash.io, reached over 50 percent of total hash power on the network a couple of years ago, hashers were also\u00a0urged to move to different pools.)\nFurthermore, even if a specific mining pool does control its hash power, nothing in the New York Agreement says these pools should mine on the SegWit2x chain exclusively. Since miners typically dedicate their hash power to maximize profit, it is very possible that this hash power will be attributed to different chains according to the value of the coins on these chains. (This is what usually happens between altcoins. Similarly, just over the past couple of weeks, some signatories to the New York Agreement have already begun directing some hash power to the Bcash chain.)\nIn its addendum, BitPay appears to be ignoring these dynamics. Once again, this has an air of deceptiveness.\nIn BitPay\u2019s Defense\u2026\nAll that said, it should be noted that the risks are still limited, even if users follow BitPay\u2019s instructions.\nThis is because BitPay is not (currently) suggesting that users run BTC1 software to send and receive transactions. Rather, BitPay is advising users to connect their Bitcore nodes to a BTC1 node as a \u201cborder node.\u201d This means that the BTC1 node will essentially act as a network filter to reject all transactions invalid under the new SegWit rules.\nUntil the hard fork in November, using BTC1 as a border node shouldn\u2019t do any harm whatsoever. BTC1 is compatible with the Bitcoin network until that point in time, and indeed enforces the new SegWit rules.\nIf no further action is taken, the BTC1 border node would switch to the SegWit2x blockchain by November. But even then, the current Bitcore nodes that are used to send and receive transactions will not make that switch. As such, BTC1 nodes would only let SegWit2x transactions through, which would then, in turn, be rejected by Bitcore nodes. This incompatibility between the two nodes actually means that no blocks would come through at all.\nAs such, no one would send or accept (confirmed) payments in a different coin than they mean to. In a worst case scenario, the whole setup essentially shuts down.\nWhile the blog post appears deceptive in some ways, BitPay\u2019s advice shouldn't, in itself, cause a of loss funds.\nShortly before publication of this article, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair said in statement to Bitcoin Magazine:\nThis was unfortunately not the way I had intended this conversation to begin. I will have more to say on this topic in the near future, and feel I owe it to the community to say something. Unfortunately, it may take a little while for that communication to happen as I have other matters demanding my attention at the moment.", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 19}

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nIn a 37-page long research paper, Warren E. Weber, research consultant at Bank of Canada who is also a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and adjunct professor at the University of South Carolina, speculated about a financial system where bitcoin would be the standard currency (referred as the \u201cBitcoin standard\u201d) instead of fiat currencies.\nIn the study, Weber explored the similarity between the Bitcoin standard and the gold standard. The research consultant chose to compare bitcoin to gold since the two have many similarities. The two most prominent resemblances include the lack of control of central banks or monetary authorities and the limit in the supply: Bitcoin\u2019s algorithm only allows the circulation of 21 million BTC while gold can be found in finite quantities on the planet. If the Bitcoin standard becomes real, there will be three distinct media of exchanges, just as there was under the gold standard. Bitcoin will serve as the main currency while there will be fiduciary currencies issued by countries\u2019 central banks, and fiduciary currencies (banknotes or deposits) issued by commercial banks.\nIssuing fiduciary currencies will be one of the very few abilities central banks can do as part of a monetary policy where banks will act as lenders of last resort. Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cvirtually costless arbitrage\u201d on an international scope will deprive the central banks of their ability to impose interest rate policies to affect their domestic economies, Weber detailed.\nShould Bitcoin serve as the standard medium of exchange, there would be a moderate increase in deflation; however, according to Weber, once a certain level is reached, the rate of deflation will be minimal. Price levels will become highly or perfectly correlated under Bitcoin\u2019s dominance in various countries, just as they did for those countries that adopted the gold standard. Despite the fact that the cryptocurrency would become the standard, Weber believes that economic crises could still happen since \u201cthey can occur under any fractional reserve financial system.\u201d\nAccording to Weber, the Bitcoin standard will benefit the economy in two ways. Due to the \u201cknown, deterministic rate\u201d at which new BTC is created, people would be able to predict the price level of the cryptocurrency more easily. The second benefit would be that investment resources which are currently devoted to hedging against fluctuations in the currency exchange rates would free up and could be used in \u201cmore productive ways.\u201d\nOn the other hand, Weber thinks that the Bitcoin standard will never come into existence since there will be heavy opposition by central banks and governments. If the Bitcoin standard becomes real, neither the governments nor the central banks will be able to implement interest rates to affect their economies, neither could they generate seigniorage revenues obtained from their ability to \u201calmost costlessly create money,\u201d the Bank of Canada research consultant explained. Since the governments don\u2019t want to lose these powers, they will do anything to prevent Bitcoin from becoming the standard medium of exchange.\nWeber is also skeptical about the longevity of the Bitcoin standard. According to him, the financial system is advancing so rapidly that there would likely be another (crypto)currency that can provide the same or greater benefits as Bitcoin, possibly at lower costs. Furthermore, if a financial crisis occurs, an opposition is likely to emerge that would seek to replace the \u201cold\u201d financial system, rather like the way that Bitcoin is challenging today\u2019s status quo.", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 16}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\n\u00c1d\u00e1m \u201cnopara73\u201d Fics\u00f3r, HiddenWallet developer and TumbleBit contributor, and \u201cTDevD,\u201d the pseudonymous Samourai wallet developer, are joining forces on a new privacy project: ZeroLink. ZeroLink is set to realize a trustless mixing scheme first proposed by Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell years ago \u2014 but one that hasn\u2019t been realized thus far.\nAccording Fics\u00f3r, the ZeroLink framework, which utilizes a scheme known as \u201cChaumian CoinJoin,\u201d is actually more straightforward than many of the alternatives that have been proposed.\n\u201cBack in 2013, there was this sort of obsession with decentralization. \u2018Everything that can be decentralized will be decentralized\u2019 was the slogan,\u201d the developer recalls. \u201cBy now we realize that decentralization is actually not always that useful. As long as a mixer cannot steal funds or link transactions, that\u2019s enough.\u201d\nCoinJoin\nEach Bitcoin transaction essentially sends bitcoins from one or several Bitcoin addresses (really: \u201cinputs\u201d) to one or several Bitcoin addresses (really: \u201coutputs\u201d). That\u2019s how bitcoins \u201cmove\u201d over the blockchain.\nThe problem, from a privacy perspective, is that the blockchain is completely public, which means that anyone can see which addresses are paying which addresses. If these addresses can be linked to real-world identities, it can reveal a lot about who transacted with whom, and perhaps for what.\nCoinJoin, the well-known coin-mixing scheme first proposed by Maxwell in 2013, is a potential solution to this problem. A CoinJoin transaction is basically a combination of several transactions merged into one big transaction. In other words, it includes inputs from several different users, and the bitcoins move to outputs controlled by several different users. As such, it\u2019s not clear which bitcoins moved where. All users effectively paid all users.\nWhile that\u2019s great, the next problem is that whomever or whatever combines the different transactions into one CoinJoin transaction can be a central point of failure from a privacy perspective. That person (or that server, or whatever it is) still knows which bitcoins moved where. So if that individual is either corrupt or corruptible, the problem isn\u2019t really solved.\n\u201cFor CoinJoin to live up to its promise, even the entity that creates the transaction must not learn which addresses are paying which addresses,\u201d Fics\u00f3r noted.\nZeroLink\nZeroLink provides a privacy framework for wallets that can be used for different mixing schemes. And it defines its own mixing technique as well: an implementation of CoinJoin referred to as \u201cChaumian CoinJoin.\u201d \nWith Chaumian CoinJoin, users both send and receive equal amounts of bitcoin from a CoinJoin transaction, so everyone receives each other's coins. This obfuscates the trails for all of these coins.\nIn practice, ZeroLink users will require two types of wallets: a pre-mix wallet and a post-mix wallet. As the names suggest, the first type holds coins that are to be mixed, while the latter is where the mixed coins end up.\nUsers then connect their pre-mix wallets to the ZeroLink tumbler and provide an input (\u201cfrom\u201d address) and an output (\u201cto\u201d address), which they both control. But importantly, the outputs are disguised (\u201cblinded\u201d) using a mathematical trick. So while the tumbler knows where all bitcoins are sent from, it does not yet know where bitcoins are sent to.\nAt the heart of the trick, the tumbler then cryptographically signs all blinded outputs, using a type of cryptographic signature introduced by David Chaum: a \u201cblind signature.\u201d This allows data to be cryptographically signed even if it is disguised. And importantly, these signatures can be checked against the original, unblinded data as well to see if the blinded data and the unblinded data match.\nNext, all users connect to the tumbler again, but this time through some type of anonymity network, like Tor. They will then provide the tumbler with the unblinded versions of the outputs. Using the cryptographic signatures it just created, the tumbler can check that all revealed outputs match all blinded outputs. If they do match, the tumbler knows that all the outputs it received are legitimate, and thus were provided by the same users that also provided the inputs to send funds.\nThe tumbler then adds the revealed outputs to the CoinJoin transaction. And it sends this transaction back to all users, for these users to sign with their Bitcoin private keys. Doing so validates the transaction. (The users should of course double check that the amounts and their outputs check out, to be sure they receive as much as they send.)\nFinally, the tumbler broadcasts the CoinJoin transaction to be included in a Bitcoin block. As a result, all users end up with different bitcoins than they started with: all bitcoins were mixed, and the blockchain trails broken.\nWhile all this is actually relatively straightforward compared to some alternative schemes, and to a large extent already suggested by Maxwell back in 2013, the process has never been realized. This is probably because it was long thought to be too vulnerable to attacks, Fics\u00f3r thinks.\n\u201cWhen Maxwell first published the proposal, Bitcoin transaction fees were practically non-existent. Because of this, it would be relatively easy and cheap to launch denial of service attacks against a CoinJoin mixing system. An attacker can just keep providing valid inputs, but refuse to sign when he should. That invalidates the whole transaction, and wastes everyone\u2019s time.\u201d\nInterestingly, this attack vector is now to some extent resolved simply because it would be too expensive to keep it going. In order to maintain the attack in a way that it\u2019s not easily countered, an attacker must provide new inputs for each round, meaning he must be able to keep moving bitcoins to new addresses to do so. \u201cAssuming $1 transaction fees, that could cost up to $1,000 a day,\u201d Fics\u00f3r pointed out. \u201cIn this particular context, high fees are a blessing in disguise.\u201d\nDevelopment\nFics\u00f3r is currently about to help wrap up the development of another highly anticipated privacy tool, TumbleBit, for Stratis\u2019s Breeze Wallet. This is expected to take another three months.\nAfter that, he plans to focus on realizing ZeroLink, while TDevD may even start working on the framework sooner. Concretely, three new codebases need to be developed: the pre-mix wallet, the tumbler and the post-mix wallet.\n\u201cThe tumbler needs to be developed from scratch. But it should be relatively easy to add the pre-mix wallets to any existing open source wallet. The same is true for the post-mix wallet implementations, though for privacy reasons not all wallets are a good fit,\u201d Fics\u00f3r said.\nHis own HiddenWallet as well as Samourai Wallet are \u201cfully committed\u201d to implementing and deploying ZeroLink into production, Fics\u00f3r said, while Breeze Wallet may be interested as well. \nOptimistically, an initial implementation of ZeroLink could be live before the end of this year.\nFor more information on ZeroLink, see Fics\u00f3r's blog post on the project (which also includes a donation address) or ZeroLink\u2019s specification.", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 18}

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nA few days ago, AMD released the \u201cRadeon Software Crimson ReLive Edition Beta for Blockchain Compute\u201d driver. According to the release notes on the tech giant\u2019s website, the software optimizes the performance for \u201cBlockchain Compute Workloads,\u201d thereby boosting the efficiency of cryptocurrency mining rigs that are using a GPU for mining (eg., Ethereum mining rigs).\nCurrently, the graphics driver can be downloaded from AMD\u2019s official website. The beta software supports desktop GPUs from AMD Radeon HD 7700, and it can be installed on 64-bit Windows 7 (Service Pack 1 or higher required) and 64-bit Windows 10 systems. AMD highlighted in the release notes that the graphics driver is not intended to boost users\u2019 gaming performance. The company added that since this is a beta software, it will not be \u201csupported with further updates, upgrades or bug fixes.\u201d\nAMD\u2019s new beta driver is designed to fix an issue related to the DAG (directed acyclic graph) size. As the number of blocks in the Ethereum blockchain increases (taking roughly 14 seconds to generate a block), so does Ethereum\u2019s epoch (a 100-hour window). For every epoch, or 30,000 blocks, a DAG is generated. As the DAG size grows, the memory requirements for mining Ethereum increase. Since the memory footprint of the workload is increasing, it will, at a certain time, overflow from the graphics card\u2019s memory and will be stored in the main system memory. The main system memory is much slower than accessing the GPU\u2019s VRAM. If a mining rig is slower to access the memory, it will result in performance penalties concerning the miners\u2019 hashrate.\nAMD\u2019s new beta driver appears to have fixed the DAG issue. According to TechPowerUp, there is only a minimal difference between mining different DAG sizes with the beta software. Compared to the old driver, the AMD Radeon RX Vega 64 8GB (1546 MHz/945 MHz) experienced an 81 percent increase in the hashrate mining DAG 199. \nThe Reddit community has also confirmed that AMD\u2019s new update is resulting in greater hashrates for their GPUs.\n\u201cMy RX Vega went from 31 to 37Mh/s mining ETH only.

Using BBT modded ROMs,\u201d another user called \u201cTheHansGruber\u201d wrote in the /r/EtherMining subreddit.\nAMD\u2019s beta driver will boost the performance of Ethereum mining rigs for a while. However, if Ethereum evolves from proof of work to proof of stake, with a first step toward this model expected on November 1, GPUs will be less needed over time.

Back in 2013, while in Athens, I set out to design a non-proof-of-work-based blockchain protocol motivated by the debt crisis in Greece, looming bank liquidity problems and the increasing discussions about the possibility of having a parallel currency. The new protocol had to be based on proof of stake to make sure that it can run even on cellphones and be secure independent of any computational power existing that is external to it.\nVery soon it became clear that the problem was going to need much more than a few months\u2019 work. Fast-forward three years to 2016: I was at the University of Edinburgh and had joined forces with IOHK whose CEO, Charles Hoskinson, was poised to solve the same problem. The protocol, \u201cOuroboros\u201d as it would be eventually named, was there but the core of the security proof was still elusive when my good friend Alexander Russell visited me. \nTogether, we tackled the problem of proving the security of the system. Whiteboards were filled over and over again until we felt we mined a true gem: a clean combinatorial argument that enabled us to argue mathematically the security of the scheme.\u00a0\nDiving Into the Mindset of a Cryptographer\nSecurity is an elusive concept. Take a system that is able to withstand a given set of adverse operational conditions. When can we call it secure? What if it collapses in the next moment when it is subjected to a slightly different set of conditions? Or when it is given inputs different from any that have been tried before? \nSecurity cannot be demonstrated via experiment alone since attacker ingenuity can rarely be completely enumerated within any reasonable timeframe. Cryptographic design, thus, has to somehow scale this \u201cuniversal quantifier\u201d: the system should be called secure only if it withstands all possible attacks. \nIn response to this fundamental problem, \u201cprovable security\u201d emerged as a rigorous discipline within cryptography that promotes the co-development of algorithms and (so-called) proofs of security. Such proofs come in the form of theorems that, under certain assumptions and threat models that describe what the attacker can and cannot do, establish the security of cryptographic algorithms. In this fashion, modern cryptographic design pushes the \u201cburden of proof\u201d to the proposer of an algorithm. \nIn the world of academic cryptography, gone are the days when someone could propose a protocol or algorithm and proclaim it secure because it was able to withstand a handful of known attacks. Instead, modern cryptographic design requires due diligence by the designers to ensure that no attack exists within a convincing and well-defined threat model. \nThis approach has been a tremendously powerful and inspiring paradigm within cryptography. For instance, the notion of a secure channel has been studied for more than 40 years. This is the fundamental cryptographic primitive that allows the proverbial Alice and Bob to send messages to each other safely in the presence (and possibly active interference) of an attacker. Today\u2019s provable security analysis, even using automated tools, has unearthed attacks against secure channel protocols like TLS that were unanticipated by the security community. \nBack in 2009 though, the blockchain was a concept that was presented outside regular academic cryptographic discourse. A brief white paper and a software implementation were sufficient to fuel its initial adoption that expanded rapidly. In retrospect, this was perhaps the only way for this fringe idea to ripple the waters of scientific discourse sufficiently and force a paradigm shift (in the sense of Thomas S. Kuhn\u2019s \u201cStructure of Scientific Revolutions\u201d) in terms of how the consensus problem was to be studied henceforth. \nAs the shift settled though, a principled approach became direly needed. The newly discovered design space appears to be vast and the avenues of exploring it too numerous. The \u201cburden of proof\u201d needs to return to the designer. \nBlockchain protocols need to become systematized, as they have gradually become one of the dominant themes in distributed consensus literature. The blockchain is not the problem; it is the solution. But in this case, one may wonder, what was the problem? \nIn 2014, jointly with Juan Garay and Nikos Leonardos, we put forth a first description of \u201cthe problem\u201d in the form of what we called a \u201crobust transaction ledger.\u201d Such a ledger is implemented by a number of unauthenticated nodes and provides two properties, called persistence and liveness. Persistence mandates that nodes never disagree about the placement of transactions once they become stable, while liveness requires that all (honestly generated) transactions eventually become stable. Using this model, we provided a proof of security for the core of the Bitcoin protocol (a suitably simplified version of the protocol that we nicknamed the \u201cbitcoin backbone\u201d). \nGiven this proof, a natural question a cryptographer will ask is whether this protocol is really the best possible solution to the problem. \u201cBest\u201d here is typically interpreted in two ways: first, in terms of the efficiency of the solution; and second, in terms of the relevance and applicability of the threat model and the assumptions used in the security proof. \nEfficiency is a particular concern for the Bitcoin blockchain. With all its virtues, the protocol is not particularly efficient in terms of processing time or resource consumption. This is exactly where \u201cproof of stake\u201d emerged as a possible alternative and a more efficient primitive for building blockchain protocols. \nSo, is it possible to use proof of stake to provably implement a robust transaction ledger? By 2016, with our Bitcoin backbone work already presented, this was a well-defined question; and the answer came with Ouroboros: our proof-of-stake-based blockchain protocol. \nOuroboros\nThe unique characteristic of Ouroboros is that the protocol was developed in tandem with a proof of security that aims to communicate in a succinct way that the proposed blockchain protocol satisfies the properties of a robust transaction ledger. Central to the proof is a combinatorial analysis of a class of strings that admit a certain discrete structure that maps to a blockchain fork. We called \u201cforkable\u201d those strings that admit a non-trivial such structure, and our proof shows that their density becomes minutely small as the length of the string grows. \nWith this argument, we showed how there is an opportunity for the nodes running the protocol to converge to a unique history. The protocol then dictates how to take advantage of this opportunity by running a cryptographic protocol that enables the nodes to produce a random seed, which, in turn, is used to sample the next sequence of parties to become active. As a result, the protocol facilitates the next convergence step to take place; in this way, it can continue ad infinitum following a cyclical process that was also the inspiration for its name. Ouroboros is the Greek word for the snake that eats its tail, an ancient Greek symbol for re-creation. \nHaving the protocol and its proof in hand gave us the unique opportunity for peer review, i.e., asking fellow cryptographers to evaluate the construction and its associated security proof as part of the formal submission process to a major cryptology conference. \nPeer reviewing at the top cryptology venues is a painstakingly rigorous process that goes on for months. Papers are first reviewed independently by at least three experts, and afterward a discussion for each paper rages on as the three reviewers, as well as other members of the scientific committee, get involved and try to converge on the intellectual merits of each submission. \nAs a result of successfully passing this rigorous peer review process, Ouroboros was accepted and included in the program of Crypto 2017, the 37th annual cryptology conference. Crypto is one of the flagship conferences of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) and is one of the most exciting places for a cryptographer to be, as the program always contains research on the cutting edge of the discipline. \nFurthermore, Ouroboros will be the settlement layer of the Cardano blockchain to be rolled out by IOHK in 2017, making it one of the swiftest technology transfer cases from a basic research publication to a system to be used by many thousands in just one year. \nWhile all this may seem like a happy conclusion to the quest for a proof-of-stake blockchain, we are far from being done. On the contrary, we are still, as a community, at the very beginning of this expedition that will delve deep into blockchain design space. There are still too many open questions to solve, and new systems will be built on the foundations of the research that our community is laying out today. \nThe views expressed in this op ed are those of its author, Aggelos\u00a0Kiayias\u00a0, and do not necessarily reflect those of Bitcoin Magazine or BTC Media.\n\nOuroboros image courtesy of Wikimedia Commons.\n\nAggelos Kiayias, chief scientist at IOHK, Chair of cybersecurity and privacy and director of the Blockchain Technology Lab at the University of Edinburgh.", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 22}

{"title": "Why Bcash Mining Shouldn't Affect Bitcoin Much (But Bitcoin Mining Could Ruin Bcash)", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/why-bcash-mining-shouldnt-affect-bitcoin-much-bitcoin-mining-could-ruin-bcash/", "birthday": "Aug 22, 2017  3:39 PM EST", "date": "2017-08-22 20:39:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nFor the past couple of days, Bitcoin Cash (Bcash or BCH) was more profitable to mine than Bitcoin (BTC). This has resulted in miners switching from Bitcoin to Bcash, causing a significant speedup of blocks on the Bcash chain, to the point where several dozens of blocks were found per hour. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin blockchain had slowed down significantly; in some cases only one or two blocks were found each hour.\nIn the short term, therefore, Bitcoin users were inconvenienced: they had to wait longer for their transactions to confirm, and they had to pay more fees to get them confirmed quickly.\nIn the longer term, however, this dynamic could make the Bitcoin Cash chain very unstable.\nHere\u2019s why.\nTheory Versus Practice: Assumptions\nIt should first be noted that, for simplicity's sake, this article makes some assumptions that do not quite (or necessarily) hold up to the full extent in reality.\nFor example, the article will assume that all (or most) miners mainly care about short-term profits, it will assume that miners can switch between different blockchains at no (or little) cost, it won\u2019t take into account that miners need to wait 100 blocks before they can spend their block rewards, and more.\nPerhaps more importantly, the article will also assume that Bitcoin block rewards are more valuable than Bitcoin Cash block rewards. At the time of writing this is the case, by a relatively large margin. Both Bitcoin and Bcash miners are awarded at least 12.5 new coins per block, but BTC is about six times more valuable than BCH. On top of that, Bitcoin blocks contain significantly more fees.\nWhile the reality of the situation is more complex than this, the overall dynamic should hold up\u00a0\u2014\u00a0at least until and unless Bcash block rewards become more valuable than Bitcoin\u2019s.\nNormal Mining Dynamics\nMiners mine to turn a profit, or at least that\u2019s the assumption for this article. They invest resources \u2014 time, electricity, hardware, and more \u2014 in return for coins.\nMining profitability is determined by the value of the block reward, and the \u201cdifficulty\u201d to mine a block. If the difficulty is higher, miners need to invest more resources to find a block. If the difficulty is lower, miners need to invest less.\nNotably, what doesn\u2019t actually matter for profitability in the short term, is how many other miners (by hash power) are mining on a particular chain. If many miners are, for example, mining on the Bcash chain, it just means that all these miners find Bcash blocks faster for a while.\nThis situation does self-correct over time, when the difficulty adjusts. On both Bitcoin and Bcash, difficulty adjusts once every 2016 blocks, which is \u201csupposed\u201d to happen every two weeks. If these 2016 blocks are found in less than two weeks, difficulty adjusts upwards, so the next 2016 blocks will be harder to find. If these 2016 blocks are found in more than two weeks, difficulty adjusts downwards, so the next 2016 blocks will be easier to find.\nThese adjustments happen relative to how much faster or slower blocks were mined than they were \u201csupposed\u201d to, but it can increase or decrease fourfold (x4 or x0.25) at most.\nBitcoin Versus Bcash\nNow, since one Bcash block reward is currently worth about seven times less than one Bitcoin block reward, Bcash can only be more profitable to mine if its difficulty is more than seven times lower. (This has been the case for the past few days.)\nBut if that occurs, something interesting happens. From the very moment that Bcash is more profitable to mine, it immediately becomes more profitable to mine for all miners. In this hypothetical, all miners would immediately abandon the Bitcoin chain, and instead mine Bcash exclusively.\nOf course, this can\u2019t go on forever. If there are so many miners on the Bcash chain, the 2016 blocks will be found extremely fast. (This has been the case for the past few days.) As such, the next difficulty adjustment comes very fast too; potentially within a day or two. (This just happened.) Importantly, because that\u2019s much too fast, the difficulty now adjusts upward by a lot: probably fourfold. (This just happened.)\nThat\u2019s where Bcash's problems start.\nAt this point, Bcash\u2019s difficulty is so high that Bitcoin is once again the most profitable chain to mine on. As such, after a lull of about two days, all miners should now switch back to mining Bitcoin.\nBitcoin\u2019s difficulty, meanwhile, was already pretty high. Once all those miners switch back, the 2016 blocks may or may not be found a bit faster than usual. But nothing out of the ordinary.\nAs such, even after the 2016 Bitcoin blocks are found, not much changes. Bitcoin would still be more profitable chain to mine. Profit-maximizing miners would therefore all continue to mine on Bitcoin only. \nAnd once the next difficulty period is over, once again, nothing will change. Bitcoin would still be more profitable for all miners.\nMeanwhile, on the opposite end of the equation, no miners would mine on Bitcoin Cash whatsoever. It's not as profitable to mine. The Bcash blockchain should freeze in its tracks.\nBcash\u2019s Solutions\nBcash does have solutions for this problem \u2014 sort of.\nFirst off, Bcash implemented an emergency re-adjustment scheme to deal with situations like these. If, within a time-frame of twelve hours, fewer than six blocks are found, difficulty adjusts downward by 20 percent. This can help get difficulty down to normal levels quicker.\nBut that\u2019s not a perfect solution in itself. For one, it does still require at least six blocks to be found, and probably more to get difficulty back to normal. This means that miners still need to mine on the Bcash chain at a loss, against their short-term interests. Furthermore, miners that are unfriendly toward Bcash could \u2014 somewhat ironically \u2014 mine on this chain just enough to prevent such a re-adjustment.\nAnd even if some miners do mine on the Bcash chain toward a difficulty adjustment, it would just set the exact same dynamic in motion after a while. The Bcash chain would be more profitable to mine for a couple of days, after which difficulty shoots upwards and the chain should freeze in its tracks. Then these miners would have to, once again, mine at a loss to keep the chain alive, only to set the same dynamic in motion again. And again. And again.\nInterestingly, this scenario could potentially benefit miners at large, especially if they coordinate. While some miners do need to mine against their short-term interests to reach the required difficulty adjustment, once that difficulty adjustment is reached, all miners get to sweep up massive amounts of block rewards within a day or two. \nAs long as there are buyers for these coins, such a stop-and-go cycle could be very profitable for miners in the long term. But it is of course not very desireable for users.\nOther Solution(s)\nThis is not a new science. \nNamecoin, one of the first altcoins, faced similar problems in 2011. After a sudden jump in hash rate, its chain got stuck, and it took months for ideologically motivated miners to work toward a next difficulty adjustment at a loss. This cycle repeated a couple of times, at which point Namecoin fixed the problem by \u201cmerged mining\u201d the coin with Bitcoin. All Bitcoin miners can now automatically mine Namecoin using the same hash power, without needing to switch between chains. Many Bitcoin miners do.\nThe problem that Namecoin had to face is also a key reason why Litecoin's creator, Charlie Lee, decided to implement the Scrypt mining algorithm in Litecoin, another early altcoin. He realized that a secondary cryptocurrency should not compete with Bitcoin for hash power on the SHA256 algorithm at all, exactly because of the instability that would result. By picking an entirely different algorithm, miners can\u2019t hop from one chain to another, thus resolving the problem as well.\nAnd many other altcoins, like Ethereum, have much faster difficulty readjustment schemes. While this may technically still require miners to mine at a loss in some cases (and could have other detrimental effects), this situation should resolve within hours or days \u2014 not weeks or months.\nIf Bitcoin Cash chooses to adopt any of these solutions, the coin will probably require another hard fork. Alternatively, of course, its block rewards will have to become more valuable than Bitcoin\u2019s\u2026\nThanks to Litecoin creator Charlie Lee for information and feedback.\nDisclaimer: The author of this article received BCH and has not sold all of it yet.", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 22}

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nLast week, the United States Patent and Trade Office (USPTO)\u00a0published the details of Visa\u2019s new patent application. The credit card giant\u2019s plans for the digital asset network are quite broad; however, it might be possible that the company is planning to file a patent for the Visa B2B Connect.\nThe blockchain enterprise company Chain and Visa announced their new partnership in October 2016, in which the two firms decided to develop \u201ca simple, fast and secure way to process B2B payments globally.\u201d The Visa B2B Connect platform\u2019s pilot is expected to launch in 2017, thus indicating a connection between the USPTO digital asset network patent and the new B2B solution.\n\u201cA method and system are provided for transferring digital assets in a digital asset network. Network users can be centrally enrolled and screened for compliance. Standardized transfer processes and unique identifiers can provide a transparent and direct transfer process. Digital assets can include sufficient information for ensuring that a value will be provided, including one or more digital signatures, such that value can be made immediately available to recipients,\u201d the four Visa employees who filed the patent summarized.\nThe patent application details the major issue financial institutes are facing with third parties. According to Visa, using third-party payment or transfer providers during wire transfers can create uncertainty in the system, resulting in the banks adding extra days to complete a transfer. Furthermore, this uncertainty can also result in higher costs. The writers of the document added that, in reality, there are often more than three parties participating in a single transaction.\n\u201cMost financial institutions only have a few correspondent bank relationships. Thus, for an international wire, it is likely that the sending financial institution does not have a direct correspondent bank relationship with the receiving financial institution.\u201d\nWhen this lack of relationship is spread among three or more parties across international jurisdictions, the process becomes even more complicated and costly.\n\u201cFor example, an international transfer may involve one or more domestic transfers in the sender's country, an international transfer and one or more domestic transfer's in the recipient's country before finally reaching the recipient's account.\u201d\nAccording to the Visa employees, a digital asset network can be the solution for the issue. The company plans to launch a platform (possibly linked to Visa\u2019s B2B Connect) using blockchain technology to allow the transfer of digital assets between clients. These transfers can be used to make payments, or provide access rights and login credentials and more. The firm emphasized that the participants of the platform will be \u201clegitimate organizations\u201d who will be screened for compliance with the rules of the network.\nTo learn more about digital asset networks, be sure to review our upcoming program for Distributed: Markets 2018.", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 24}
{"title": "Segregated Witness Activates on Bitcoin: This is What to Expect", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/segregated-witness-activates-bitcoin-what-expect/", "birthday": "Aug 23, 2017  9:59 PM EST", "date": "2017-08-24 02:59:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe Segregated Witness (SegWit) soft fork has activated on the Bitcoin network.\nAs of block height 481,824, found at 1:57 UTC\u00a0by BTCC, all SegWit ready nodes started enforcing the new SegWit consensus rules. As Bitcoin\u2019s biggest protocol upgrade to date, this introduces a whole new data structure, which changes the appearance of Bitcoin blocks for upgraded nodes \u2014 while non-upgraded nodes should continue to function as normal.\nMore concretely, SegWit activation means that Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit is replaced by a block \u201cweight\u201d limit, which allows for blocks up to 4 megabytes in size. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, SegWit transactions won\u2019t suffer from the \u201cmalleability bug,\u201d which in turn enables advanced second-layer protocols like the Lightning Network, atomic swaps, MAST, and more.\nHere\u2019s what to expect for the next couple of hours, days, weeks, months and beyond\u2026\nThe Block Size Limit Becomes a Block Weight Limit\nBitcoin blocks now have a weight limit instead of a size limit.\u00a0Depending on the types of transactions included, this means that blocks can get up to 4 megabytes big \u2014 though some 2 megabytes is a more realistic maximum. This should decrease network fees for users, and speed up transaction confirmation times.\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t mean that all blocks will immediately bump to 2 megabytes in size today. For a transaction to utilize the added space, it must be sent from a SegWit address (or more accurately, a Segwit \u201coutput\u201d) \u2014 not just to a SegWit address.\nAt the time of activation, of course, no bitcoins were locked up in SegWit addresses whatsoever. That wasn\u2019t possible up till now. So at the very least, bitcoins must be spent once to a SegWit address once first. Only when they\u2019re spent again will they benefit from the extra space.\nAdditionally, wallets and other applications need to be ready to accept SegWit transactions. Some wallets, like GreenAddress, may offer this option on day one, or shortly thereafter. \u201cWe had this in testnet on by default for a very long time now,\u201d GreenAddress developer Lawrence Nahum told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it's available almost immediately after activation; we just want to make sure activation is smooth before we enable it.\u201d\nSimilarly, large Bitcoin service providers could start accepting SegWit transactions right away, though some may need more time to prepare. BitGo, a Bitcoin infrastructure provider for major exchanges like Bitstamp, Kraken and OKCoin, expects to be SegWit-ready relatively soon as well.\nBitGo engineer Jameson Lopp told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not set an actual date, though we certainly want to deploy it as soon as possible. I expect general availability sometime next week.\u201d\nSome other wallets and services, however, may take a little longer; how long will differ from wallet to wallet.\nLightning and More\nArguably even more highly anticipated than an increased block size, second-layer technologies like the Lightning Network\u00a0and, further out, Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST), will be more easily built on top of Bitcoin, thanks to Segregated Witness.\nMost of this technology is still a work in progress, and it could take several more months before regular users are expected to use it. That said, it is likely that there will be experimentation on Bitcoin\u2019s mainnet rather soon, according to Lightning Labs CEO and cofounder, Elizabeth Stark.\n\u201cToday we released version 0.3 alpha of our Lightning Network Daemon software, which is the last major release before our mainnet beta release,\u201d said Stark to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe're not giving any exact predictions, but our goal is to get it up and running as soon as it's thoroughly tested and stable. We may also see some test mainnet transactions by developers once SegWit activates.\u201d\nAnd even when the Lightning Network is functional and in use, it will take a little longer to roll out more advanced features that utilize the Lightning Network or similar protocols. These include atomic swaps, which allows for the instant and (near) costless exchange of cryptocurrencies over different blockchains, like bitcoin and litecoin. And Stark said a larger development ecosystem is growing around the technology as well.\n\u201cWe're seeing app development on the Lightning Network taking off, which we're very excited about. Once the mainnet releases are out, we expect there to be a bunch of apps working on the Lightning Network out of the box,\u201d she added.\nFurther, more nuanced benefits of SegWit, such as faster transaction signing by hardware wallets, will be available within a matter of days. The more efficient Schnorr signature algorithm is also expected to be implemented and rolled out on Bitcoin at some point, but this will take at least several more months to be production ready\u00a0\u2014\u00a0or longer.\nThe Risks\nAt this point in time, SegWit activation does still present some risks for users.\nThe first risk applies to all soft forks, and depends on miners actually enforcing the new rules. If some don\u2019t, non-upgraded nodes as well as many light clients in particular could accept invalid transactions and blocks, at least until the network corrects that through a blockchain reorganization (\u201creorg\u201d). In the past, soft forks caused some (minimal) network disruption, but the risks do seem limited this time around.\n\u201cI suspect that the reorg risk is relatively low for full nodes with SegWit. The only prior case like this was that validationless mining chain-split two years ago, but that didn't affect full nodes,\u201d Blockchain consultant Peter Todd told Bitcoin Magzine. \u201cAnd fortunately Bitcoin Core includes a lot of improvements to speed that older and alternative implementations don't have, so there's a good chance basically all miners are running Bitcoin Core with only small modifications to non-consensus code, if any.\u201d\nAdditionally, the first couple of hours after activation do open a small window for advanced types of miner attacks, which resemble (or are) 51% attacks. If large amounts of bitcoin are sent to SegWit addresses after activation, miners could theoretically still \u201croll back\u201d the blockchain to a point in time before activation to re-build it from there. Since SegWit outputs are not secure before activation, such a rollback could allow miners to steal these funds.\nLike any other 51% attack, the costs to perform this attack does increase for every block that is found after activation, to the point where it becomes infeasible quite fast. That said, it is probably wise not to send huge amounts of bitcoin to SegWit addresses straight away, and instead wait at least a couple of hours or maybe days to do so.\nLastly, Todd pointed out that some (untested) services may fail shortly after SegWit activation, as they have likely only integrated SegWit support partially. \u201cFor example, remote procedure calls could request SegWit transactions, while at the same time rejecting these transactions because they didn\u2019t expect to get them.\u201d These kinds of issues should be easy to fix, however.\nAlso read Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s cover story for the month: The Long Road to SegWit: How Bitcoin\u2019s Biggest Protocol Upgrade Became Reality.\n\n.\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 24}

The Pacific island nation of Papua New Guinea (PNG), north of Australia, has joined the movement with its own central Bank of Papua New Guinea running blockchain trials.\nCentral Bank Governor Loi Bakani, known as a champion of new technologies as a way to enable financial inclusion, recently hosted a conference to showcase his country\u2019s commitment to blockchain technology, with participants from at home and around the world, including Abt Associates, Paycase, Othera, IDbox, Pacific Markets, UCash, Seso and ADCCA.\n At the conference, Bakani described the blockchain trials underway at the Bank of PNG and introduced the PNG Digital Commerce and Cryptocurrency Association for the growing number of Papua New Guinea tech entrepreneurs and businesses interested in blockchain technology. \nBakani said, \u201cThis will allow PNG to join the Global Blockchain Forum, which gets PNG a cutting edge in discussions about Blockchain at a global level, along with Australia, Canada, U.S.A., Dubai, UK and Japan. There is no reason why PNG can\u2019t be a leader for emerging markets.\u201d\nThere are already central banks experimenting with blockchain technology around the world, including Bank of America, HSBC, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Bank of England, People's Bank of China, Bank of Canada, the National Bank of Cambodia, and the Central Bank of India.\nElizabeth Genia, Assistant Governor of the central Bank of PNG said, \u201cIt is the new innovations that can change people\u2019s lives \u2014 almost 85 percent of our people live outside the banking system.\u201d\nAccording to Abt Associates\u2019 Jane Thomason, who helped manage the conference, 85 percent of PNG has little or no access to banking services and accounts, and the island is among the most expensive remittance corridors in the world, with nearly 10 percent of all funds transferred going to fees alone.\nThomason told the conference that blockchain-based technologies offer developing nations a way to leapfrog conventional technological advancements, similar to the adoption of cell phones in much of the world. \nShe noted, \u201cIn 30 years working in PNG, I have never had so much optimism that we are working with something that really will change the lives of poor Papua New Guineans.\u201d\nPNG\u2019s IT Minister Francis Maneke told the conference, \u201cPapua New Guinea is an ideal proving ground for these applications. In fact, there is a possibility that we will leapfrog many developed nations in our use of this sort of smart technology, giving us a competitive edge as early adopters.\u201d\nConference speaker and Paycase CEO Joseph Weinberg told Bitcoin Magazine that the conference looked at ways that blockchain technology could be used in all sectors of PNG\u2019s economy. \n\u201cThe conference included the creation of frameworks, roadmaps and deployment strategies. In order to make anything of this magnitude work, you need proper planning between the government, regulators, commercial partners and the Central Bank. Corporations in particular need to be engaged as they will enable much of the infrastructure needed to make it happen. This is where PNG is headed.\u201d \nBakani also expressed the hope that blockchain technologies could be deployed in many sectors of PNG\u2019s economy. \n\u201cWhen looking at large-scale deployments of this magnitude,\u201d said Bakani, \u201cwe truly value our international panelists and partners and look forward to further discussions as the Bank establishes the next stages of its blockchain implementation.\n \u201cThe government, along with the necessary stakeholders here in PNG not only recognize the challenges they face, but now see the clear opportunities that blockchain-based systems can enable for their country and people.\u201d\nIn closing the conference, Maneke said, \u201cWe in the O\u2019Neill government are determined to bridge the digital divide to ensure our people can participate in the global economy, and not be excluded from it.\u201d\nFunding for the conference was provided by the Australian Government and was managed by Abt Associates. \n\\", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 24}

Currently Blockstream Satellite covers across two-thirds of the Earth, and service expansions are in the works.\n\u201cToday\u2019s launch of Blockstream Satellite gives even more people on the planet the choice to participate in Bitcoin,\u201d said Blockstream co-founder and CEO Adam Back, when the announcement was made. \u201cWith more users accessing the Bitcoin blockchain with the free broadcast from Blockstream Satellite, we expect the global reach to drive more adoption and use cases for Bitcoin, while strengthening the overall robustness of the network.\u201d\nThe idea of streaming the Bitcoin blockchain to the whole planet from satellites in space had previously been proposed by Jeff Garzik, but Blockstream\u2019s implementation introduces some interesting tweaks: It relies on existing commercial satellites already in orbit and leverages open-source software, namely GNU Radio and FIBRE, to reduce costs.\nThe announcement of the Blockstream Satellite has been received with considerable interest from both the blockchain and space communities, but also with doubts and lingering questions. Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Adam Back and Chris Cook, Head of Satellite at Blockstream, to find out more. \n\nYou are essentially using existing commercial satellites as relays. Why is this approach better than building, launching and operating your own satellites, now that cubesats and cheaper cubesat launch systems permit doing so cost effectively?\nChris Cook: While there have been many recent reductions in the cost of cubesats and other low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, it is still a considerably more expensive venture than using existing satellites. As cubesats are not geosynchronous, they are always moving overhead. This means that you need many of them for complete global coverage. \nAdditionally, many cubesats have a lifetime of only a few months before they fall out of orbit. Either you need to continuously replenish them or you have to boost them into higher orbit, both of which increase costs.\nFinally, we have not entirely dismissed the idea of launching our own satellites. However, deploying a global satellite network with existing satellites seemed like a good first step. It allows us to deliver this service to people throughout the world quickly and cost effectively.\nWhat could you do with dedicated custom satellites that you can't do with the current system?\nChris Cook: A dedicated satellite would potentially enable us to operate a node on a satellite itself rather than [have it be] supported from a ground station. \u00a0\nWhat if political pressures force your commercial satellite service providers to cancel your contracts?\nAdam Back: Because Bitcoin is already widely used and made available via other means in many countries around the world, the threat of the satellite broadcast of Bitcoin being canceled is not likely. The satellite network is providing redundant, low-cost availability for data that is already publicly available and downloadable by anyone over the internet. There are multiple satellites from different providers in the Blockstream Satellite network.\nRelated to that, does Blockstream Satellite (or a conceivable extension) permit improving on the privacy and anonymity of bitcoin transactions?\nAdam Back: Blockstream Satellite allows passive receipt so there is basically no footprint of internet traffic allowing your ISP or monitoring companies analyzing the Bitcoin network to track your node. This may make it attractive even for users with fast home internet to use Blockstream Satellite, where they can then connect and pin their wallet to their home node via Tor. \nFor geographies where high-speed internet is expensive or not available, they can connect smartphone wallets over WiFi or meshnet to satellite nodes, and broadcast transactions via SMS gateways such as SMSPushTX, by Pavol Rusnak, or bi-directional Ku or L-band internet services (available commercially and unrelated to Blockstream Satellite) which can be expensive, but even the most expensive at $10/MB works out to less than one US penny per transaction, as Bitcoin transactions are small.\nSo, I have set up my Blockstream Satellite receiving station. I am not connected to the internet. How do I send a bitcoin payment?\nAdam Back: See above via SMS, or often people do have 2.5G or 3G data but at expensive data rates. Because Bitcoin transactions are small, the cost of sending a transaction is small, even if receiving the blockchain would be expensive. \nFor shared equipment, perhaps for a village or business area, a bi-directional satellite internet is also cost-effective, again because of small Bitcoin transactions. L-band BGAN is mobile, and Ku band [Hughes receivers] are fixed satellite dishes.\nYour FAQ says that transactions can be sent using other communication channels such as SMS. Do you operate your own SMS relays for bitcoin transactions or do you recommend using external services? If so, which ones?\nAdam Back: We do not at this time operate an SMS gateway but Pavol does (see above). We are working with and encouraging Bitcoin enthusiasts and entrepreneurs to build out custom infrastructure configurations and share setup tips online.\nWhat are some of the innovative \u201ckiller apps\u201d that you hope Blockstream Satellite could enable?\nAdam Back: We see the Blockstream Satellite service as one stepping stone to decentralizing Bitcoin by radically reducing node cost and therefore scaling the ability for people to run nodes.\nThe Blockstream Satellite provides many advantages for different kinds of network configurations:\nNo internet or expensive internet: Connect a smart phone wallet to a satellite node via WiFi or meshnet;Partition protection: Use a satellite as a cheaper source of blocks, and cross check with other peers. In the event of an internet partition, the satellite will automatically bridge the network outage;Privacy: Use Blockstream Satellite to receive the Bitcoin blockchain with zero or low network footprint. You can verify the satellite data via other peers, and in low bandwidth conditions, with as little data as an 80 byte SMS with the most recent blockheader;Financial sovereignty and security: Blockstream Satellite reduces the cost of running a full node to nearly zero. By running a full node and connecting your smartphone wallet and other wallets to it, you no longer need to trust third parties: As the saying goes, \u201cDon\u2019t Trust. Verify!\u201dDecentralization: One of the most interesting properties of Bitcoin is that it is a permissionless and digital gold-like bearer asset. To ensure Bitcoin stays permissionless, it is important that many people across many countries, [including] individuals and small businesses, run full nodes. By radically reducing the cost of running a full node, we hope many more people will, guaranteeing Bitcoin\u2019s permissionlessness and reinforcing its bearer status.\nIn terms of innovative applications, we intend to provide a developer API to send application data via the satellite paid in mBTC/KByte so that the developer community, startups and local entrepreneurs can bring new applications to market.\nWe launched phase 1 satellite coverage across two-thirds of the world\u2019s landmass, and we have plans for worldwide coverage by the end of the year. [As] Blockstream Satellite provides complete Bitcoin coverage globally, it becomes possible to access Bitcoin from a village without high speed internet and without grid power. Or with the right equipment, you could even access Bitcoin on the move from an RV or boat with motorized dishes.", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 24}

Since finding its local bottom around $1,800, BTC-USD has paved a fairly clean schematic of support and resistance levels along the Fibonacci Retracement values:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 6-hr Candles, Bitfinex, Fibonacci Levels Post-bottom\nThe high $2,600 values (also the 23.6 percent Fibonacci Retracement line) have historic significance in this market because they are firmly established support values. However, if we look at the 6-hr volume trend, we can see that each rebound off the $2,600 values was paired with decreasing volume on every attempt to break support. The volume trend shown above is typically a sign that the market is no longer confident in the higher price values and will ultimately need stronger volume to break new highs.\nZooming in on the most recent test of $2,600, we can see another clean set of Fibonacci Retracement lines paving strong support and resistance values for the current trend:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 2-hr Candles, Bitfinex, Current Bull Trend\nFrom this perspective, the strong support outlined in Figure 1 (the 23 percent Fibonacci Retracement values) is now shown in Figure 2 as the 50 percent Fibonacci Retracement values. However, this most recent bounce is showing strong signs of market momentum loss. \nFor those who are familiar with my style of technical analysis, I put a strong emphasis on volume trends and how they correlate with price movement. This trend is no exception: the most recent bounce is continuing to rise on decreasing volume. A trending market that moves on decreasing volume typically indicates that the trend is beginning to exhaust and will likely need to consolidate or pull back to garner support from lower values. Our current trend has several indicators of bullish exhaustion outlined not only in the volume trend, but also in the MACD and RSI (both tools are market momentum indicators).\nThe MACD and RSI are showing bearish divergence. Bearish divergence is a trend used by market analysts to objectively view price activity for indications of potential pullback or market consolidation. When the price is in an uptrend and the MACD histogram (the green/red bars) fails to make a new peak to correspond to the new price highs, the ears of bearish investors perk up, as this is typically when bears are looking to place their short positions. Much like the MACD histogram, the RSI can also be used to show market momentum loss \u2014 the market is said to be diverging bearishly if the price makes a new high but the RSI does not make a new high.\nThis recent, low volume climb in BTC-USD value is not terribly surprising. BTC began its ascent right around the time several major exchanges enabled Bitcoin Cash (BCH) deposits. Once the BCH deposits were enabled, those who were previously sidelined immediately post-fork were able to sell off their BCH and reinvest in other coins. (I won\u2019t dive into BCH-USD analysis, but if you take a look at the price trend, it lines up with the BTC-USD price climb.) \nTypically, it isn\u2019t advisable to zoom in terribly close within the crypto-market because the volume doesn\u2019t provide useful resolution to its perceived trend. However, in times of high volume I find it useful to look at the timescales as small as 5-minute candles to get a small peek at where the market is heading short-term:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 5-min Candles, Bitfinex, Double Top Reversal\nCurrently, the 5-minute candle trend is showing signs of a textbook Double Top Reversal (shown in the rectangle). The volume profile showing spikes on the two local highs indicates a pullback in price is possible. \nLooking at the MACD histogram, we can see no signs of downward momentum loss as the histogram continues to make new lows to correspond to the lows made in price movement. To accompany the MACD, sustained sell volume is evident and hints toward continued interest in the lower price range. I won\u2019t go into the details of how to calculate Double Top Reversal price targets, but if this reversal pattern holds true, we can expect price movement close to the 23 percent Fibonacci Retracement line shown above.\nSummary:\nOn both the macro and micro trends, BTC-USD shows signs of diminishing upward momentum.Exchanges recently enabled BCH deposits, and it is very likely that the recent hike in BTC-USD price was due to trades selling their BCH and purchasing BTC.The immediate trend shows signs of bearish momentum and is in the process of testing a Double Top Reversal pattern.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

A hard fork is a change to the software protocol that creates a permanent divergence from the previous version of the blockchain, such that nodes running the old software are no longer accepted by the newer version. The change was for the purpose of improving scalability, the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s ability to handle larger-size blocks of transactions. \nThe number of transactions per block swelled from 400 in 2014 to 2,000 at the beginning of 2017, so developers had plenty of advance warning to work out a solution for greater scalability. The hard fork is an example of decentralized democracy in action in that participants registered their preference regarding one of two methods for addressing the scalability challenge. The majority of the constituencies (developers, miners, exchanges, wallet companies and merchants) elected the hard fork to one of the new protocols (SegWit2x), while the other group split to a new Bitcoin blockchain, Bitcoin Cash, which supports another protocol. \nIt was almost possible to see Adam Smith\u2019s invisible hand operating in real-time as transactions amassed and the first block was recorded on the new Bitcoin Cash blockchain six hours after the split. It comprised of 6,985 transactions in a block size of 1.9 MB, indeed almost two times the previous block size, thus demonstrating greater scalability. \nThe economic theory upshot of the Bitcoin hard fork is that it is a demonstration of competitive markets proceeding in an orderly and efficient fashion, offering choices to participants, who coordinated themselves between the two options. \nDevelopments in Regulation: The SEC\nA second recent event in the blockchain economy is in regard to regulation. On July 25, 2017, in the U.S., the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) ruled that ICOs (initial coin offerings, also known as token sales), unlike crowdfundings, in certain cases, may count as securities and therefore would be subject to securities registration laws (both the offerings and any exchange coordinating their purchase and sale). \nAn initial coin offering is similar to an IPO but is an investment directly in a company project, in exchange for cryptocurrency coins or tokens, which provide greater liquidity to both investors and companies. It is complicated because the SEC may use the Howey test, a long-standing mechanism, to determine whether a particular instrument is a security or not, in their analysis of ICOs. \nIt could be that ICOs are split into two categories: those that are regulated (i.e., subject to securities laws) and those that are unregulated (i.e., exempt from registration). \nUnregulated offerings may pertain to \u201cutility coins\u201d as in the case of storage cryptocurrencies (such as Siacoin [SC] and Storj [STORJ]). These projects may be categorized as internet network public goods creation, where tokens are related to network operation but not profit-garnering. \nRegulated offerings concern investments that are more like the traditional idea of stock, where shareholders have an expectation of profit and a say in corporate governance. ICOs in the latter form would need to comply with securities registration laws. \nThe economic theory implication is that involved parties are sorting out the definitions and treatment of new kinds of entities in the blockchain economy using established precedents. Above all, knowing the regulatory stance of governments can help to stabilize the market. The SEC acted in the wake of what some call an \u201cICO dotcom bubble,\u201d in which some firms raised millions of dollars within minutes for their crypto-projects. \nThe result is that the investment market for cryptocurrencies is becoming distinctly more institutional. One indication is the SEC\u2019s move to regulate ICOs. Another is the decision of the U.S. CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) in July 2017 to grant approval for cryptocurrency derivatives to be launched by LedgerX on the CBOE (the largest U.S. options exchange). This is important because derivatives markets are already connected to the vast global institutional trading ecosystem, and thus cryptocurrency derivatives might be a more accessible and liquid means of trading and investing in cryptocurrencies than the underlying cryptocurrencies themselves. A third indication is \u201cProject Omni\u2019s\u201d announcement in August 2017 that it will be building a platform for trading large-size positions (i.e., $20 million and up) for the institutional market. \nMany Sectors of the Economy Go Crypto\nA third important recent development is the awareness that the blockchain economy is a system in which businesses create private currencies that compete for customer acceptance in the marketplace. \nEconomists from Friedrich Hayek to Paul Krugman have envisioned and heralded this development. The word \u201cprivate\u201d has different meanings in the blockchain economy. Here, \u201cprivate\u201d is meant in the sense of being offered by companies in the private sector as opposed to governments in the public sector. Traditionally, governments have had a monopoly on offering currencies, but blockchain technology is changing that. \nThe other meaning of \u201cprivate\u201d in the blockchain economy is that there are public chains where anyone may participate, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and private or \u201cclosed\u201d chains where users must be approved, such as the closed banking chains envisioned for securities clearing. \nThe closed banking chains (like those of the consortia R3 in U.S./Europe and NEM in Japan) would be a shared ledger for an industry group that wants to clear transactions among themselves. \nWhile Hayek only saw private currencies for financial institutions (i.e., there would be a ChaseCoin, a CitiCoin, etc.), cryptocurrencies are emerging for many kinds of businesses across all sectors of the economy. A notable example is decentralized storage (private online cloud storage), where consumers may choose between Sia (SC), Storj (STORJ) and MaidSafe (MAID). \nBefore picking, websites like CoinMarketCap and WorldCoinIndex can be consulted to check the health of a company\u2019s cryptocurrency. \n\nThe CoinMarketCap listing starts to read not only as a directory of money-like cryptocurrencies, but closer to what might be Hayek\u2019s wildest dream: a listing of a new-world economic order.\n\nThere are businesses in storage, news (Steem [STEEM] and Yours), healthcare (Factom [FCT]), financial services (NEM [XEM]), the Internet of Things (IOTA [IOTA]), blockchain as a service (BaaS) technology platforms (Stratis [STRAT]), fundraising platforms (Waves [WAVES]) and interbank transfer (Ripple [XRP]). Business cryptocurrencies are mixed in with cryptocurrency cash systems (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash and Zcash). CoinMarketCap is a listing of the rich panoply of the economy itself.\nRecent blockchain economy events \u2014 the Bitcoin hard fork, the SEC ruling about ICOs and a growing awareness that blockchains are popping up in many sectors of the economy \u2014 suggest that economic principles might be a helpful tool for distinguishing hype from structural change in that these three developments appear to be significant and enduring.\nMelanie Swan:\u00a0Blockchain Theorist, Purdue University; MBA Wharton, University of Pennsylvania.

{"title": "Bitcoin Cash or Bcash: What's in a Name?", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-cash-or-bcash-whats-name/", "birthday": "Aug 7, 2017  1:43 PM EST", "date": "2017-08-07 18:43:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nAs Bitcoin Cash, or Bcash, is slowly but surely turning into a functioning cryptocurrency, one topic remains contentious in particular: its name.\nMany proponents of the coin, judging by popular sentiment on social media like Reddit and Twitter, prefer the initial name: Bitcoin Cash. But an increasing number of users, including many who are more skeptical of the new coin, consider this name too close to \u201cBitcoin\u201d and therefore confusing. They instead refer to the new coin as \u201cBcash.\u201d\n\u201cThe \u2018Bitcoin Cash\u2019 project didn\u2019t have time to prepare branding prior to splitting from Bitcoin, so the community provided a name and logo to help the project succeed on its own merits,\u201d said \u201cBashCo\u201d, the pseudonymous moderator of the r/Bitcoin subreddit who labelled the new coin as \u201cBcash\u201d in a much-read \u201csticky\u201d on that subreddit.\nBackground\nIn its short history, what we now know as \u201cBitcoin Cash\u201d and \u201cBcash\u201d has already gone through several name changes.\nThe project was first publicly introduced on June 14. At that point it was referred to as Bitmain\u2019s \u201ccontingency plan,\u201d which the hardware manufacturer would launch in case the BIP 148 user-activated soft fork took off. An implementation of this plan was presented a little over two weeks later as \u201cBitcoin ABC\u201d at the Future of Bitcoin conference in Arnhem, the Netherlands. But as it turned out, this was actually the name of the specific software implementation presented \u2014 not of a (future) currency. \nThis distinction became clear another two weeks later, as Chinese mining pool ViaBTC announced to realize the Bitcoin ABC plan to create a new coin, which it would call \u201cBitcoin Cash,\u201d with the ticker BCC.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for people to realize this was problematic. On the r/btc subreddit, user \u201cpaleh0rse\u201d first suggested a name change, because \u201cthe full name \u2018Bitcoin Cash\u2019 is going to confuse the living shit out of newcomers, the general public, and media alike.\u201d paleh0rse instead proposed the name \u201cBitcash\u201d, but this suggestion didn\u2019t gain much traction.\nOn top of that, the ticker BCC was already taken at several exchanges. In most cases, BCC is associated with BitConnect Coin, a top-20 cryptocurrency by market cap according to coinmarketcap.com. And major Bitcoin exchange Bitfinex uses the ticker BCC for BTC futures in case Bitcoin Unlimited creates a new currency (BTU). As a result, some exchanges list the new coin under an alternative ticker: BCH.\nBcash\nIt was one of these exchange, Bitfinex, that also announced a full name change for the cryptocurrency itself. As opposed to ViaBTC, Bitfinex decided it would use the name \u201cBcash\u201d instead of \u201cBitcoin Cash\u201d as the descriptive name: \u201cto avoid confusion with Bitcoin.\u201d\nBitfinex\u2019s lead was followed by two of the three wallets that initially decided to integrate the new coin: hardware wallet Trezor and multicurrency wallet Jaxx. In a statement on Twitter, Jaxx COO Charlie Shrem explained that they, not unlike Bitfinex, made their choice in order to avoid user confusion.\n\u201cWe have hundreds [of] thousands of users who have no clue what\u2019s going on,\u201d Shrem wrote. \u201cSaying \u2018bitcoin cash\u2019 is confusing as hell to them. Unless you\u2019re in user ops for a big company you probably have no idea how much people don\u2019t understand technicals of bitcoin. 99.9999% #bitcoin users aren\u2019t on Twitter or Reddit and don\u2019t know anything technical about it.\u201d\nSimilarly, when asked by Bitcoin Magazine, Trezor architect Marek \u201cSlush\u201d Palatinus explained:\n\u201cThe reason we prefer to use \u2018Bcash\u2019 is to protect users from using the wrong wallet by accident. This would be a huge problem especially because Bcash has the same address format as Bitcoin, so we cannot protect users on the application level. We asked the Bcash team to change the address prefix before launch, which would solve it. But they refused.\u201d\nThese concerns do appear to be backed by real-world data. A survey conducted by Pierre Rochard suggests that some 25 percent of regular people don\u2019t know that \u201cBitcoin Cash\u201d is distinct from \u201cBitcoin.\u201d And so far there are, indeed, a number of reports on social media from users that accidentally sent BTC to a BCH wallet or vice versa.\nBitcoin Cash\nYet, Bitcoin Cash proponents remain unconvinced. \nMany maintain that the name \u201cBitcoin Cash\u201d simply is what the new coin is called, and claim that the name \u201cBcash\u201d is mostly pushed by those who disapprove of the project. Some even go so far as to consider the rebranding insulting or even a \u201csocial attack\u201d on the new cryptocurrency, solely intended to \u201cdegrade\u201d it to an altcoin like any other.\nBitcoin ABC lead developer Amaury \u201cDeadal Nix\u201d Sech\u00e9t and one of the initiators of the project told Bitcoin Magazine that he does not like the \"Bcash\" rebrand version either. Ironically, where \u201cBitcoin Cash\u201d critics don\u2019t like the name because it confuses users with Bitcoin, Sech\u00e9t thinks that using a new name for Bitcoin Cash is confusing.\n\u201cPushing for a second name is an attempt at confusing users. The people who do this don't have the best interest of users in mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIf everyone would switch to \u2018Bcash\u2019 I would also switch. But it looks like that name comes from a very loud minority. And I think \u2018Bitcoin Cash\u2019 is better anyways: Bitcoin forked in two branches. These two branches are now two flavors of Bitcoin.\u201d\nSo far, most companies that integrated the new coin into their service in one way or another, including Bittrex, Changelly and BTC.com, have also chosen to use the name \u201cBitcoin Cash.\u201d\nThe same is true for instant cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift. \nWhen asked by Bitcoin Magazine, Emily, the official spokesperson for ShapeShift, explained:\n\u201cWe decided to call it Bitcoin Cash because that is what the developers of the project call it. We aren\u2019t taking any political sides on this matter and are just treating it as we do any other asset that is in high demand by our users.\u201d\nResolution\nThere is no clear resolution for this \u201cconflict.\u201d \nWhile someone, somewhere may have a trademark on the name \u201cBitcoin,\u201d this trademark has so far never been enforced. And with no government, company or any single entity in charge of the cryptocurrency, anybody can ultimately call the new coin whatever they like.\nFurthermore, since even Bitcoin users that are critical of the new project received a share of BCH, it\u2019s no stretch to assume that the majority of BCH holders are fine with \u201cBcash\u201d or even prefer it. \n\u201cBcash is our coin too,\u201d BashCo pointed out. \u201cThe backlash against \u2018Bcash\u2019 is unfortunate considering that many of us who realize that \u2018Bcash\u2019 is superior branding are holding exactly as many Bcash tokens as we hold in Bitcoin tokens. We want to help Bcash develop into a strong brand that will compliment Bitcoin without confusing users.\u201d\nBut of course, the most ardent supporters of the new project disagree that \u201cBcash\u201d is any better, and it seems unlikely they'll give up on the name \"Bitcoin Cash\". Specifically, they generally prefer to keep the word \u201cBitcoin\u201d in the name because, from their point of view, the coin is a continuation of the Bitcoin project they got involved in.\n\u201cI'd say the name, \u2018Bitcoin Cash\u2019 conveys what the project intends to do, while also differentiating from Bitcoin, as Bitcoin decided to go in another direction than peer-to-peer cash,\u201d \u00a0S\u00e9chet said. \u201cPeople who see anything else in there, like an attempt at confusing users, are projecting.\u201d\nAnd while S\u00e9chet did acknowledge the problems presented by the similar names, he prefers to solve these problems through other means.\n\u201cI agree it\u2019s a problem if users accidentally send BTC to Bitcoin Cash addresses, or the other way round,\u201d he said. \u201cFor this very reason, changing the address format is in the plans. But note that even when a coin is sent to a wrong address, that coin is not lost forever. As long as you hold the private keys you can retrieve the funds.\u201d\nBitcoin Magazine has decided to use \u201cBCH\u201d for the same reason some exchanges did: \u201cBCC\u201d is taken. Moving forward, we\u2019ll refer to the new coin as \u201cBitcoin Cash\u201d as well as \u201cBcash\u201d for short, not unlike \u201cSegregated Witness\u201d and \u201cSegWit.\u201d\nDisclaimer: The author of this article received BCH and has not sold all of it yet.\n", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 7}
{"title": "A New Era of Content Publishing and Licensing on the Blockchain", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/new-era-content-publishing-and-licensing-blockchain/", "birthday": "Aug 4, 2017  4:34 PM EST", "date": "2017-08-04 21:34:00", "content": "Alex Kroeger is currently in economic consulting and is a former analyst for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He is interested in the economics of money and payments and was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013. He holds some bitcoin and various altcoins.\nThe internet and social media have unleashed unprecedented access to information. The time between content creation and widespread publication has become vanishingly small. Along with this ease of access and sharing, however, comes a lack of control over one\u2019s own content. With a few clicks, content can be republished without reference to its original source, thereby obscuring who the authentic owner is.\nWhat the internet has lacked up to this point is a network-based log of ownership that can keep pace with the exchange of information. Enter blockchain technology. While the first and currently most prominent application of this technology is an internet-based payment system, this will over time prove to be just one of many use cases.\nOne of the earliest non-financial applications of blockchain technology was a service called \u201cProof of Existence.\u201d The service embeds a hash of a document into a block in the Bitcoin blockchain. A user can use this embedded hash to prove that the document existed at the block height containing the hash without relying on a trusted third party, creating a decentralized timestamping service.\nPo.et is a blockchain protocol that aims to expand on the concept of Proof of Existence to become a transformative tool for the publishing industry. In its early development, Po.et will be a platform on which written content can be timestamped using the Bitcoin blockchain and be discoverable along with important metadata. Eventually, Po.et aspires to create a fully decentralized marketplace in which publishers, editors and content creators can interact with purchase and licensing agreements without the frictions that exist today.\nThe Inspiration\nMax Bronstein, media and strategy lead for Po.et, said that the project was born out of some challenges faced at Bitcoin Magazine. He stated that Po.et was designed to help answer \u201cquestions of ownership or attribution on the web,\u201d including \u201cwho owns the work, who created it and whether or not the usage of the work is authorized.\u201d \nAccording to Bronstein, these questions are currently difficult to answer for many works, and the organizations that manage ownership and licensing information like Getty Images and Creative Commons often exist in silos without interoperability with other platforms.\nRichard Titus, an entrepreneur who formerly helped lead digital content at BBC and the Daily Mail, joined the Po.et advisory board in July. He said, \u201cPreserving an ecosystem of content creators, publishers and advertisers requires the establishment of ownership and Po.et is at the right stage of development to bring a true marketplace into existence.\u201d \nThe Roadmap\nThe Po.et development team has divided their milestone iterations into three \u201ceras\u201d: Rosetta, Gutenberg and Alexandria. \n\u201cThe Rosetta era represents Po.et\u2019s potential to enable new understanding of written works, their authenticity, provenance and edit history through blockchain-based timestamping,\u201d said Bronstein. The first era has already begun offering these timestamping services to publishers of written content. The document, along with standardized metadata, is stored on the BitTorrent network so that it can be discovered by any party interested in knowing its origins and authorized uses.\nThe second stage, the Gutenberg era, is projected to begin in April 2018. During this stage, Po.et intends to expand its platform to include custom licensing agreements for registered assets, revenue sharing and a written content marketplace. Payment channels will be utilized at this stage to enable cheap and instant micropayments for the agreements with a wide array of more than 40 publishers. One key application of these features may be an e-book metadata format that can serve as an alternative to the current costly standard for creating discoverable metadata for books: the ISBN system.\nThe third and final era, Alexandria, is slated to begin in July 2019. \u201cThe Alexandria era is when we expect Po.et to reach scale and become the first universal ledger for all types of digital assets, just as Alexandria was the home of the first world library and greatest repository of all human knowledge,\u201d said Bronstein. \nThis stage will see the expansion of the Po.et platform beyond written content to include image, video and audio assets. Furthermore, Po.et hopes to introduce in this stage a fully decentralized marketplace open to all stakeholders with a reputation system to promote honest use of the network. In this stage, developers will be able to write and deploy smart contracts that interact with this open marketplace. One major use case of Alexandria could be brand licensing, an industry estimated to total over $250 billion in sales annually. The simplified process of verifying authenticity and negotiating terms with Po.et could open this market to smaller players.\nThe Early Adopters\nBitcoin Magazine was the first to integrate the Po.et document timestamp into its platform \u2014 you can find a Po.et authentication badge at the top of this page. Other major digital media publishers in the blockchain space have signed on as alpha partners, including The Merkle, Crypto Insider, CoinSpeaker and ChainB. \nPo.et has also forged a unique partnership with the LTB Network through which owners of the LTB Network\u2019s LTBCOIN can swap their tokens for up to a total of 1 percent of the total Po.et tokens available. \nAdam Levine, founder of the LTB Network, stated that \u201cPo.et is an elegant solution to one of the biggest real world publishing problems. At the LTB Network, we\u2019re excited to become one of the first fully integrated publishing platforms which will allow all written content to be published through and easily re-licensable with the Po.et project.\u201d\nFunding Po.et\nThus far, Po.et has secured financial investments from BTC Inc. and several blockchain notables, including Fenbushi Capital, led by Bo Shen, Feng Xiao and Vitalik Buterin; Simon Dixon and BnkToTheFuture; Michael Cao of block.one; and Matthew Roszak and Anthony Di Iorio.\nPo.et will also be funded by a token sale taking place on August 8, 2017. At that time, 50 percent of the total supply will be sold off for bitcoin or ether. \nPOE tokens represent a proportional stake in the fees generated over the Po.et platform. While these fees are currently subsidized by the Po.et Foundation during the Rosetta era, they will eventually be generated by processing license payments and creating content licenses and then collected by the Po.et Foundation in future eras.\nDisclaimer: Bitcoin Magazine is an alpha partner of Po.et. BTC Inc., the parent company of Bitcoin Magazine, is an investor in Po.et.\n", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 4}
{"title": "Op Ed: The Role of Trading Bots in the Cryptocurrency Market", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/role-trading-bots-cryptocurrency-market/", "birthday": "Aug 7, 2017 2:11 PM EST", "date": "2017-08-07 19:11:00", "content": "Similar to Wall Street and stock trading, bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading is a form of income for many. Due to the nature of the medium, however, many bitcoin traders do it as a side project, focusing their energy on a main job or alternate work.\nBut to generate passive \u2014 or active \u2014 income in these industries, you must be paying attention to current market trends and activity. Market shifts happen so fast, you can lose a lot of money if you don\u2019t act soon enough, or don\u2019t have time to trade when it\u2019s opportune. That\u2019s exactly why chat and trading bots have exploded on the scene.\nBots are automated systems that share information, answer queries and even perform actions \u2014 like trading bitcoin for money and vice versa. For example, Haasbot, a popular trading bot among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, will do most of the work for its users. It watches prices and exchange rates, handles trading and more. They are so efficient, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ve interacted with a bot and never even knew it.\nMany of these tools require a subscription or monthly fee to continue using them. A handful allow you to pay in bitcoin.\nBots Are a Unique Form of AI\nBots use machine learning and data to improve themselves over time. As people interact with them and use them for more tasks, the bots learn, so to speak. Extensive analytics and software that is capable of creating trend-based algorithms make this possible. In time, they can even learn to invent their own languages to communicate with one another more efficiently.\nIn many ways, you can draw parallels between the development that chatbots go through to that of human beings. Regarding potential uses, capabilities and size, they start small and then grow into something more mature. Take, for instance, modern AI systems like Google Assistant, Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana or Amazon's Alexa. Sure, those platforms are all consumer-based, but they started out a lot less accurate and useful and grew gradually into what they are today.\nYou can now ask Alexa queries, have her read books and news snippets, get weather updates and even go shopping all via voice commands. Want to play some tunes from your music library or stream from Spotify? She can do that, too, and more.\nFrom the moment you place an AI assistant (like Alexa or Siri) in your home, you can tell how advanced and useful it is. The same applies to chatbots, which are designed to do many things through the power of one-to-one messaging. They wouldn't exist without modern AI technologies, nor would they be able to interact with you fully as they do now.\nHow Are Chatbots Influencing the Cryptocurrency Scene?\nIn the past, if you didn\u2019t have the time, knowledge or skill set to invest in part- or full-time trading, you couldn\u2019t participate. Sure, like stock trading, you can earn money, but it will never be substantial unless you\u2019re present and active on a regular basis.\nChatbots allow you to be involved in the cryptocurrency marketplace while focusing on other responsibilities. But not just in an omnipresent way, they\u2019re clued in to industry trends, know the necessary data and patterns and exactly when to trade \u2014 and when not to. Technically, you could say it\u2019s cheating a little.\nOf course, there are bots that make the process easier and provide up-to-date information during a query too. These bots are for convenience and to help traders stay in the loop. Think of them as sort of an RSS or news feed for cryptocurrency updates.\nSome offer additional tools and functions. For instance, you can use a bitcoin calculator with a standard financial calculator to do conversions, simply by interacting with a bot. You can look up recent trends to make informed predictions and see what others have been trading and how much.\nEssentially, bots can provide all the necessary resources to be a successful and active trader. But how is this influencing the industry and the market?\nThe answer is quite simple. It\u2019s making the entire space more competitive, and it\u2019s also helping the cryptocurrency industry boom. Arbitrage trading \u2014 the act of buying and selling commodities in one market and selling them for higher in another \u2014 is now possible with chatbots and automated systems. Another possibility is called market making, which involves generating profits based on long-term activity via sales and orders.\nAs chatbots and similar automated systems are opening up new avenues and opportunities for traders, they, in turn, are helping the industry grow and become more substantial. In the first quarter of 2017, the aggregate cryptocurrency market cap reached an all-time high of $25 billion for every top 10 asset rallies. Blockchain, the backbone of cryptocurrency, and the currency are growing \u2014 and fast.\nWhat Bots Are Available?\nThere are too many bots and automated systems to list fully here, but we can explore some of the most popular systems available to traders.\nHaasbot \u2014 We already discussed this bot, which costs about 0.12 BTC and 0.32 BTC every three months.Tradewave \u2014 While not a conventional bot, this platform allows traders to come up with their own strategies and algorithms. You create \u201cstrategies\u201d which are then used to control and influence the systems decisions and actions. You can download crowdsource strategies, too, if you don\u2019t want to make your own. An entry-level subscription is $14 a month.Zenbot \u2014 This open-source system is a full-scale, lightweight trading bot. It can handle multiple assets at once, and high-frequency trading, as well. This is important because it\u2019s rare in the bot market. Plus, the open-source nature allows anyone to modify and update the code.Cryptotrader \u2014 This automated system takes advantage of cloud computing. You don\u2019t have to install any software or programs, and it allows anyone to get involved. It\u2019s relatively young, however, so it doesn\u2019t have the same track record as the other bots mentioned here.Gekko \u2014 Yet another open-source platform, this one can be found on GitHub. It\u2019s quite basic and cannot handle high-frequency trading or arbitrage trading, but that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s meant to be a minimal solution for those interested in cutting through the noise.BTCRobot \u2014 Considered to be one of the original bots on the scene, BTC Robot is hit-or-miss for many. It does all basic trading and everything you\u2019d expect it to, and there is a 60-day full refund policy if you want to try it out.\nBut There Are Risks\nWhile there are many benefits and rewards to speak of, there are risks as well and it\u2019s important to keep them in mind for many reasons.\nFor starters, bots are more of a tool than a guaranteed solution. You'd be forgiven for thinking otherwise, especially since they simplify the entire trading process through automation. But they don't help you choose trades. That is something you, as an experienced professional, will have to do on your own. This creates risk for error because, ultimately, you're the one deciding what trades and transactions the bot will focus on. Choose the wrong ones, and you will lose money. \nBots are extremely useful for taking advantage of market inefficiencies, a perk that many traders will take advantage of. Over time there will be a massive influx of traders using bots in this way, which will contribute to inefficiencies slowly disappearing. When that happens, no one will be able to claim an advantage, at least not in the same ways.\nFinally, bots are generally designed to do something specific or carry out a specific set of instructions. Like most industry-exclusive tools, they require working knowledge not just of the process in question, but the market too. To operate heavy machinery, for instance, you get specialized training and learn to use the equipment for varying tasks, all of which are often within the same industry or market. By nature, tools are specialized, and cryptocurrency trading bots are no different.\nIn short, this means that not everyone can take advantage of or profit from this technology, even if it's marketed in that way. Remember you're still choosing the parameters of trades, so you need a working knowledge of the industry. You also need to be able to understand cryptocurrency values compared to real-world values. There's a lot to manage, and it's not something that everyone can succeed at without the proper training and knowledge, even if they're using a bot.\nAre Bots Necessary for Successful Trading?\nWhile bots do help automate the process and make it easier and faster-paced, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you need working knowledge of cryptocurrency and the market. As with stock trading, you cannot hope to blindly jump in and make a huge profit. Of course, beginner\u2019s luck is possible, but luck will only carry you so far.\nBefore you consider working with these platforms and deploying a bot of your own, you\u2019ll want to make sure you understand the full breadth of the industry and how the market operates.\nThis is a guest post by Kayla Matthews.

Looks like I was wrong. Shortly after posting my previous BTC-USD analysis, in a matter of one hour, the price of BTC-USD not only broke its record high, but it surpassed it by $200 after ultimately settling in the $3200s. As of this morning, BTC-USD pushed another ATH of $3440 on Bitfinex marking a $600+ in less than a week. Let\u2019s take a look at what these moves can possibly mean for BTC-USD and if these moves are sustainable.\nStarting in the $160s, BTC-USD has been on a massive, multi-year bull run:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 3 Day Candles, Bitfinex, Macro Bull Trend\nIf we plot the trend using $3440 as the top of this trend, a lot of historic support and resistance levels start to make a lot more sense within the context of the market. Our move to the $1800s marked a test of the 50% retracement line, our battle over the $2600s marked the various tests of the 23.6% retracement line and now our ultimate sudden rush to new highs can be seen as the 100% retracement line.\nKeeping the same Fibonacci Retracement Lines and zooming into our daily trend, a few observations immediately pop out:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 1 Day Candles, Bitfinex, Macro Bull Trend, Zoomed In\nThere is an obvious price increase on the long-term trend;Our recent run from $1800, however, has seen decreasing volume on every leg up;The multi-period MACD and current MACD histogram both show Bearish Divergence; andThe RSI is showing Bearish Divergence.\nIf we take a closer look to the market post-$1800s, we see a similar trend of divergence even on the smaller timescales:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 6 Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Current ATH\nThe uptrend in price is, once again, accompanied on decreasing volume;The 6HR is strongly diverging bearishly;The RSI is showing strong bearish divergence; andThe 6HR Bollinger Bands show several candles fully formed outside the upper band (shown in the circle).\nFor those who are unfamiliar with Bollinger Bands: Simply put, they are a strong tool used to visualize market volatility. Typically, when a market is near the edge of the upper band, it is considered \u201coverbought,\u201d and when it nears the edge of the lower band it is considered \u201coversold.\u201d When a market punctures a band it will typically yield a pullback to a trend within the bands, and when a candle is completely formed outside the bands it is usually a strong sell or buy signal \u2014 a sell signal in our case. You can think of the Bollinger Bands like a set of rubber bands: the tighter you stretch a rubber band, the harder the reaction. Typically, this is the case for markets that puncture the bands and especially for those that fully form candles outside the bands. \nLooking at our current Bollinger Band trend, one might be tempted to say, \u201cBTC-USD appears to be pulling back within the 6-Hour Bands \u2014 looks like a healthy move upward is still in the cards.\u201d However, if we zoom out and look back through the history of BTC-USD and its interaction with the 1-Day Bollinger Bands, we can see a clear market trend.\nFigure 4: BTC-USD, 1 Day Candles, Bitfinex, Bollinger Band Trend\nAbove are several historic examples of BTC-USDs reaction to a puncturing of the 1-Day Bollinger Bands. More often than not, a puncturing of the bands \u2014 whether the lower or upper band \u2014 is greeted with a market pullback. The stronger the break of the bands, the stronger the pullback. The strongest breaks of the bands have a very strong tendency to return to the middle line of the Bollinger Bands (the dashed line) before continuing its trend up or down. \nIf there is so much damning evidence of a pullback, why does the price keep rising? Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is unpredictable and irrational. FOMO can push markets well beyond what Technical Analysis can predict and often defies market indicator signals. With all the hype surrounding the recent hard fork, and the influx of money coming from people cashing out their Bitcoin Cash where does this leave us? There is a mountain of evidence suggesting this market level is unhealthy and highly overextended; it needs either to consolidate considerably or retrace. BTC-USD is tightly wound and there is very little, if any, sign of health within its most recent market moves. \nI\u2019m not saying the market won\u2019t continue to the pump even higher than it is currently \u2014 Goldman Sachs has a price target of $3600, after all. However, with each hike in the BTC-USD price, we are increasing the likelihood of a strong pullback and ultimately a return to the center of the Bollinger Bands.\nSummary:\nOn all relevant timescales, BTC-USD is showing strong signs of an overextended market.The Bollinger Bands have several candles fully formed outside the upper bands on the 6 HR, 12 HR and 1 Day Candles.Historically, when the 1 Day Bollinger Bands are punctured, there is a market pullback.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Since 2009, when the digital payment system was first introduced, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have entered the market. According to a recent story in MarketWatch, their combined market cap now sits around $100 billion.\nThat\u2019s a heck of a lot of money. But in terms of a timeline for how blockchain technology is evolving, we are still in the early days. In fact, some say we are still developing the basic protocols for future projects to be built on. \u00a0\nSo, for those developers and entrepreneurs who have been following from the sidelines, I am happy to say that if you are thinking of launching your own cryptocurrency, the doors are wide open. \nBut be warned, you will need to know a lot more about crypto than just coding. In fact, there are several hurdles to overcome. \u00a0\nDeciding Who You Want to Be\nThe first is deciding on a value proposition. Every successful cryptocurrency since bitcoin has focused on solving a unique problem, whether that\u2019s privacy, fungibility, governance or something else. And your project should be no different. \nJust make sure the road you go down is the one that resonates with you the strongest. After all, your project may end up being around for a long time, so you want to make sure you feel passion for what you are doing. \nThat said, you still need to do due diligence to find out if there is a market for your idea. And, since blockchain technology is complex on the face, that may require you to become a little more technically competent or, at least, comfortable with reading academic papers. The key is understanding how the feature sets you are interested in works at a high level. \nAnd before you get started on your own white paper, you want to make sure you are not duplicating someone else\u2019s work. \nA good place to begin your search is public forums like BitcoinTalk. Often, when a project posts its technical paper, an accompanying thread of ideas and input follows. \u00a0\nAs these forums are a great source of crowd knowledge, you will learn more than you would reading the paper alone. For instance, you might like an idea, only to find out, in the course of reading a forum thread, that it\u2019s a total scam. At the same time, it is important to beware of trolls that berate an idea for their own particular agenda.\nNavigating the Negativity\nOf course, at some point, you will be the one sharing ideas and collecting feedback on those forums. But brace yourself. Forums and Slack channels are notorious for trolls. Resist the urge to punch back. The key is letting the negativity flow through you. \nRemember, the community is watching, and they will judge you on your measured responses. In fact, a good barometer for how substantial a project is lies in how well the founders respond to well-thought-out criticism. So, always engage positively. Good rapport between the people running a project and those using the currency \u2014 or mining the chain \u2014 speaks of legitimacy. \u00a0\nAlso, sort the wheat from the chaff. When you look into someone else\u2019s projects, you will see fudders (fear and doubters) who are pushing questionable agendas. They tend to tip their hand by their behavior. When they come in hot, making vague, absurd statements, respond with substantive, well-reasoned points. \u00a0\nFunding Your Project\nAs your project grows, you will need marketing people, designers, developers and advisors. At some point in the job interview, however, those folks are going to say, \u201cShow me the money,\u201d which brings us to an important point: You will need some type of funding for your project. \nThere are several routes to raising money. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are all the rage lately. But, before you get carried away, keep in mind how you raise money now will reflect on your project later. So, fundraise responsibly and cap your ICO. \nIn my opinion, projects that raise over $10 million in an ICO put themselves at risk. They dilute the value of their token. As a result, unless the project turns out to be a resounding success, a lot of unhappy \u201cinvestors\u201d are going to be left holding the bag. In other words, raising huge amounts of money also raises expectations for the project, so put together a budget and raise only what you think you will need. \u00a0\nAlong those lines, you should only consider an ICO if you already have a clear roadmap for your project and a team put together that includes at least one developer. Otherwise, frankly, you are not a real company and raising any amount of money would be unethical. \nOne final ICO caveat, run your project through the Howey test. If it passes and your token qualifies as security, you risk getting a phone call from the SEC down the road, so you will want to consider other investment options. \nYou could do what zcash did, for instance, and take a percentage of the mining reward. At Decred, we bootstrapped for the first year and now the project takes a 10 percent subsidy on the mining reward. Other projects (litecoin, bitcoin, etc.) depend on donations. \nAnd, don\u2019t be afraid to consider venture capital (VC) funding either. It is still a viable option, and you can combine VC funding with other approaches. \nFinding Developers \nThis is the hardest part of any project. You will need to find people with the mindset for blockchain development \u2014 not an easy task. Many people think they can cut it in this special niche, only to find out later that the problem-solving is way too complex for them. \nAnother consideration is cost. Luring experienced developers from existing projects is expensive. You may be better off training developers with experience outside blockchain technology to become blockchain developers and work on your project. \nSo, how do you find these skilled individuals? By continually engaging with the community, attending hackathons, meetups and other events. Your first\u00a0two developers will be the hardest to find because they will be the ones who do the heavy lifting of translating your white paper into code. But once you start pulling a team together, others will become easier to attract. \nEstablishing Credibility \nOnce your project gets off the ground, the next step is creating an economic network around your currency. One way to get people invested in the future of your project is to pay them for their services in your coins whenever possible. Some projects give away coins to grow their network. This method of seeding is known as an \u201cairdrop.\u201d \u00a0\nWhen your network has proven itself secure and your coin builds up some liquidity, you want to get the coins listed on exchanges. Start at some of the lower-tier exchanges like Bleutrade and Bittrex. As your coin gets more popular, you can expand to exchanges like Shapeshift. And, once you really hit the big time, Coinbase. \u00a0\nAs far as a timeline, expect to spend six months researching and putting together a white paper. After that, continually building and extending a network is a lifelong project. But, chances are, once you become a full-fledged member of the community, you won\u2019t want to leave.\nThis is a guest post by Jake\u00a0Yocom-Piatt.

There\u2019s still a perception that 3D printing is an expensive and overhyped way to manufacture cheap plastic toys, but the reality is that today\u2019s 3D printers can process a wide and increasing range of materials and complex designs.\nWith comparatively low manufacturing costs \u2014 and no shipping costs \u2014 3D printing is expected to have an important industrial impact. Personal 3D printing has been compared to the beginnings of the personal computing industry in the 1980s, and 3D printing enthusiasts envision an explosive growth of the sector similar to the growth of the internet in the 1990s. \nAccording to Gartner, a technology consulting firm, 3D printing is now starting to push its way into manufacturing operations that require quick-to-market builds, unique design requirements and low-volume production runs.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that 3D printing is rapidly advancing toward printing military-grade hardware. This and other advanced applications of 3D printing are still reserved for industrial manufacturing. Following a typical contemporary trend, it can be expected to reach the average consumer soon.\nThe 3D printing industry is making advances toward printing electronic components and entire devices, as well as food, drugs and even organic tissue and entire organs for transplants. So, we can expect that a 3D printing economy will develop to encompass local manufacturing of all sorts of goods, from the simple to the complex, from public domain or commercial design specs.\nThe 3D printing economy is expected to have a multi-tiered ecosystem with complex virtual supply chains, and, of course, it will include payment layers. For example, smart contracts embedded in 3D printable goods could enforce use-based pricing models.\nSecuring 3D Code on the Blockchain\nOf course, the devil is in the details. What if fake designs end up in 3D printed goods intended for important security-critical applications? How will the industry combat piracy?\nThe Secure Additive Manufacturing Platform (SAMPL) project, developed by a consortium of German companies and institutions coordinated by PROSTEP AG, wants to develop a comprehensive security solution for additive manufacturing. The project is sponsored by the German Ministry of Economics and Energy for a period of three years, with $3 million (\u20ac2.6 million) in funding. The SAMPL team presented a concept demonstrator at the past Hannover Fair.\n\u201cThe process starts with the generation of the digital 3D print data and the exchange of the data with a 3D print service provider,\u201d notes the project outline. \u201c[A] digital license management based on Blockchain technology will be integrated into the data exchange solution OpenDXM GlobalX of PROSTEP AG\u2026 Blockchain technology is also applicable to the representation of transactions in the sense of licensing. Here, instead of a bitcoin, a printer obtains the license to print a component.\u201d\n\"We want to use the blockchain to mediate between designers, print service providers and end users, thus making license management safer \u2014 from generating print data to the exchange [between] service providers and the marking of workpieces, for example by means of RFID chips,\u201d explained Felix Engelmann and Henning Kopp, scientists at the Ulm Institute for Distributed Systems, in a recent interview.\nThe developers expect the SAMPL project to act as a pathfinder and open up new markets in the field of additive manufacturing and other areas of application in which the authenticity of product data has to be ensured.\nIn its announcement of the integration of blockchain technology in OpenDXM GlobalX, PROSTEP notes that 3D printing has the potential to revolutionize value-added chains such as prototype construction and spare parts management. \n\u201cWhen it comes to the globally distributed manufacture of components, it must be guaranteed that only authorized persons have access to the data, that only the original data is printed, and that this data cannot be misused to manufacture pirate copies following its authorized use,\u201d reads the statement. \u201cThis is particularly important when security-critical components are involved.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 8}

The company has embarked on the ambitious mission of developing one of the largest image databases.\nThe database, which will be available for all to use, intends to be the backbone of AR and machine-learning training. It seeks to suppress startups and developers' dependency on proprietary image datasets owned by tech giants.\n\"Existing databases are controlled by the company who built them: Google, for example, has made such a database. However, there are two problems with this approach: Google controls this database and can, at any moment, forbid their competitors from using it, remove access to it, etc. Second, this database includes only the data Google thinks is needed,\" George Popescu, CEO and co-founder of Lampix, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nInstead, Lampix is electing to offer a database where \"no single company, and not Lampix neither, will control who has access to the data, and what data should go in the database.\"\n\"No centralized control. This is why we are working on the blockchain,\" he said.\nLeveraging blockchain technology, Lampix is building a network that rewards users with Lampix tokens, called PIX, to take pictures, describe them and assemble open-source, curated image datasets. Miners can use any device that has a camera with the sufficient resolution, including the company's Lampix device, to submit datasets.\nDatasets submitted will consist of an image and description. To make sure the image and description match, voters will either upvote or downvote a dataset and will be compensated with PIX tokens if their vote aligns with the consensus.\nThird-party developers will be able to access these datasets to train their own computer vision applications by paying a small fee using PIX.\nLampix is planning to include a hash of each picture on the blockchain once it is approved and added to the database. This will increase security and address two main concerns: ensuring that a picture hasn't been tampered with and ensuring that a user is using a full dataset, meaning that no picture has been removed or added.\n\"Developers will be able to tap into this database for their own product, such as Google Glass, Holo Lens or our Lampix product and create applications,\" he said. \"This is exciting, as for any application, a lot of data is necessary to make it accurate and work properly.\"\nLampix plans to create a total of 1.1 billion PIX tokens. It will sell 50 percent of its tokens in a crowd sale over a period of three days. At launch, one PIX will cost $0.12. The company aims to raise roughly $50 million.\nPopescu said the team is currently working with exchanges to list the PIX tokens in as many platforms as possible. \"We expect it will be listed on Gatecoin, Bittrex, Kraken, Yunbi and a few more quickly,\" he said.\nNew York-based Lampix builds and sells hardware devices and software that bring augmented reality to any flat surface, turning these surfaces into interactive displays. Using machine learning and computer vision, Lampix recognizes objects and projects context-relevant buttons and menus for different actions.\nThe company serves the likes of Bloomberg and PwC, as well as large retail chains. It claims it has a pipeline of about 200 famous companies inquiring about its Lampix device.\nThe database will allow Lampix to improve its technology and make it more accurate as computer vision and machine learning need a lot of images for training and testing.\n\"Our plan is simple: to map the world inside. Not the room, but actual objects on desks, tables, the surfaces themselves. Or even objects on the floor, on the kitchen counter, on your bathroom counter,\" he said. \"Google Maps changed the world, but they only have access outside. Imagine what will happen if we map the interior world.\"\nMuch of the business world's interest in blockchain has been centered on financial and banking services. Yet, possible applications of the technology go well beyond financial services.\n\"There is a lot of opportunity with user content which is not being explored very much. Many people focus on blockchain in finance,\" Popescu said. \"However, I think that sourcing user content, and using the technology to manage license and access, is a huge opportunity. AR/VR is just a small piece of this.\"", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 8}

Chris is also a senior interpreter and translator.\nOn June 22, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Antshares was embarking on a new rebranding strategy as part of its effort to lead blockchain development in China and around the world.\nNow, on August 8, NEO Blockchain, China\u2019s first original public chain project, has announced the completion of rebranding efforts from its former Antshares identity. Furthermore, NEO has upgraded its blockchain nodes, technical documents, social media, official site and exchange name worldwide, representing the transition from Antshares 1.0 to the NEO smart contract system 2.0. \nNEO now is the top 10 cryptocurrency in terms of market value. It hopes to capitalize on its Chinese connections by calling to mind the success stories of other Chinese behemoths like Alibaba and Tencent. Whereas a month ago NEO may have been trying to \u201csteal the spotlight from Ethereum,\u201d it now seems to be trying to carve its own path forward.\nCompared with Ethereum, NEO claims its smart contracts perform better in terms of determinism, high scalability and compatibility. The developers of smart contracts can use JAVA, C/C# and GO to write smart contracts without the need to learn new languages like Solidity, making it attractive to the global developer community.\nPowered by the Community \nIn the press conference held on June 22, Antshares announced its rebranding of \u201cNEO\u201d with an emphasis on upgrading itself to a smart economy platform with an integration of digital assets, digital identity and smart contracts. It has also introduced notable new features like a cross-chain protocol, quantum-resistant cryptography, a distributed storage protocol and a secure communication protocol. \nOther new additions include PC web and mobile apps, as well as an introductory video about the project.\nDa Hongfei, the founder of NEO, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cNEO\u2019s development hinges on two important teams: one is the Shanghai-based development and management team, while the other is an international team called \u201cCity of Zion,\u201d purely supported by the community, thanks to a huge number of volunteers for NEO.\n\u201cThe community just volunteered to translate the video and other materials into multiple languages. Furthermore, the technical white paper has also been translated by the community into English, Spanish, Japanese and Korean. We are especially grateful to the community, which will remain the core of NEO\u2019s development in the future.\u201d\nNew Partnerships Underway\nSInce its successful upgrade, NEO has added full smart contract support, attracting a range of blockchain startups to work with its platform. Bancor, Coindash and Agrello are among some of the first to have reached agreements for technical cooperation with NEO. \nMeanwhile, Red Pulse and other projects have announced that they will join the NEO ecosystem and adopt its smart contracts.\nRed Pulse, an event-driven Chinese market research company, will build a research sharing platform built on the NEO 2.0 smart contract platform. It will allow readers to guide market research and to use digital currency to reward analysts and contributors directly and fairly, disrupting the current financial research market models. The project will also release a new token, $RPX, powered by the NEO platform.\nElastos, launched by Rong Chen, Jihan Wu and Feng Han, is a new blockchain-powered operating system. According to an announcement,\u00a0in July of 2017, \u00a0NEO and Elastos made a cooperative agreement to \u201cexplore the technological values and applications of blockchains in the new internet operating systems to further the development of a Smart Economy.\u201d Elastos plans to become an \u201cOS for the blockchain,\u201d while NEO will enable developers to create blockchain applications quickly and easily. \nFurthermore, the Nest Smart Fund, based on NEO smart contracts, will be a brand-new form of investment fund that will eliminate (as much as possible) the high thresholds, high risks, inefficiencies and moral hazards often associated with traditional fund intermediaries. Backed by blockchain technology, Nest will allow anyone to participate transparently and easily in the Nest fund.\nAs NEO Council Secretary General Tony Tao told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cThe core of the platform-level blockchain lies in the establishment of the ecosystem. For the next step, we will launch the NEO Seed Project, hoping to inspire the global community and to encourage traditional technology developers to use the NEO Smart Contract platform.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 9}

In a matter of five days, ETH-USD managed to increase by $100 \u2014 nearly a 50 percent market value increase \u2014 with very little pullback or consolidation. After ETH-USD\u2019s multi-week-long bear run from $420 to the $130s, ETH spent over a month consolidating and forming a very solid support level before ultimately launching into its most recent bull run. Let\u2019s take a look at some support and resistance levels, and see where ETH is likely heading in the next few days.\nLooking at the macro view of this trend, we can see significant levels of support and resistance that have proven time and time again to be especially relevant throughout the life of the market:\nFigure 1: ETH-USD, 12-hr Candles, Bitfinex, Macro Trend\nAfter consolidating between the 50 percent and 61 percent retracement values, ETH-USD managed to gather enough of a foundation to break out and climb in a very strong bull run. The trend was so strong, in fact, that throughout the run, it traced the upper Bollinger Bands for several days. \nZooming in a little closer to our current candles within this trend, we can see a couple signs of slight market exhaustion that could lead to some minor pullback or possible consolidation:\nFigure 2: ETH-USD, 12-hr Candles, Bitfinex, Closer View of Current Trend\nAlthough not a guarantee of market trend reversal, the doji candle is a sign of market uncertainty as the bearish and bullish traders attempt to gain dominance over the market. Essentially, dojis represent an opportunity for market reversal as the price movement becomes stalemated between buyers and sellers. Whether the market will actually reverse requires the confirmation of the next candle in the market. Currently, we are forming the confirmation candle to decide if we will actually reverse the 12-hour candle trend.\nZooming in even further, we can see very clear support and resistance lines not only on the macro Fibonacci Retracements shown above, but also on the Fibonacci Retracements for the current bullish breakout:\nFigure 3: ETH-USD, 1-hr Candles, Bitfinex, View of Current Breakout\nThis breakout has managed to find support along all the major Fib lines. Currently, there is strong support between $275 (the macro 38 percent line) and $268 (the micro 50 percent line). Should a further retracement occur in this market, I would highly expect it to be short-lived and most likely rally off the 50 percent micro Fib line, ultimately making new ETH-USD highs in this bullish market. Currently, there are two things in this market that are catching my eye:\nDuring highly bullish markets, it is really common to retrace to the 38 percent line and bounce to a continuation of the bullish trend. Currently, we are in the process of bouncing off the 38 percent bullish trendline.If we zoom in to the 15-minute candles, we see a potential ascending wedge forming \u2014 a bearish continuation pattern.\nFigure 4: ETH-USD, 15-min Candles, Bitfinex, Ascending Wedge\nIf this ascending wedge breaks to the bottom with high volume, we can expect a price target of approximately the 50 percent retracement line \u2014 the $270s. A retracement to the 50 percent values would be a very healthy event and would most likely see a pretty substantial bounce and subsequent rally leading to new highs. To further support the thesis of an ascending wedge, we can see clear MACD divergence paired with decreasing volume as the price continues to climb. \nOverall, our current ETH-USD seems to be strongly bullish and doesn\u2019t appear to show any signs of macro bullish momentum loss. Right now, it is doing healthy retracements that commonly lead to trend continuations.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nSegregated Witness (SegWit), the highly anticipated protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team, just reached the point of no return for lock in. This means that SegWit will be live on the Bitcoin network in a little more than two weeks from now.\n\u201cIt's been a long and hard process, but we've learned tremendously along the way. I look forward to the next generation of use cases and applications this will enable and to watching the ecosystem mature\u201d, said Eric Lombrozo, Ciphrex CEO, Bitcoin Core contributor, and one of the authors and main advocates of Segregated Witness.\nLock In\nSegregated Witness, defined by Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 141 (BIP141), was deployed using an activation mechanism (BIP9) that requires 95 percent of all miners (by hash power) to signal support for the upgrade within the span of a two-week difficulty period. That\u2019s at least 1916 blocks within 2016 blocks, to be exact.\nThis threshold has just been reached. While the current difficulty period will not end until tomorrow, all blocks in this difficulty period are signaling support for the upgrade so far. This now totals over 1916 of them.\nIt took a while to achieve this threshold, largely in part because bigger mining pools on the Bitcoin network were refusing to adopt the upgrade, regardless of their technical readiness.\n\"In hindsight, it\u2019s become clear that miner activation of soft forks cannot be relied upon when there exists a divergence of interests between miners and users. In the cooperative case, it is a tried and tested mechanism which, if done correctly, is known to work smoothly. However, in the adversarial case it simply does not work,\u201d Lombrozo wrote in an article about SegWit activation.\nThis is why SegWit was eventually adopted through a couple of slightly complex \u201ckludges.\u201d\nBitcoin Improvement Proposal 91 (BIP91), a (mostly) miner-enforced soft fork, had already activated a little over two weeks ago. This soft fork requires all blocks to signal Segregated Witness support for an entire difficulty period, triggering the lock-in on SegWit-ready nodes \u2014 all blocks that do not should be rejected by the network. So far, this has indeed been the case.\nOn top of that, BIP148, an activation mechanism enforced by users, started rejecting all blocks not signaling support for Segregated Witness over a week ago, on August 1st.\nSegWit\nA viable way to deploy Segregated Witness on Bitcoin via a soft fork was discussed in the Bitcoin development IRC chats and subsequently presented by Blockstream engineer and Bitcoin Core contributor Dr. Pieter Wuille in late 2015 at the Scaling Bitcoin workshops in Hong Kong. It was subsequently adopted as a centrepiece in the scaling roadmap endorsed by the Bitcoin Core development team. The technology was implemented and officially released in Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 in October of 2016.\nIn short, this upgrade allows for the separation of transaction data and signature data within Bitcoin blocks. This solves the long-standing \u201cmalleability bug\u201d in the Bitcoin protocol, which in turn allows for more flexibility when programming new features on top of Bitcoin and offers additional benefits like a modest block-size limit increase.\n\u201cMost importantly, SegWit means a drastic simplification in how we can design protocols that can work atop Bitcoin without having to change consensus rules,\u201d Lombrozo noted. \u201cBut it also affords the introduction of new features at the consensus layer to support better cryptography and more sophisticated smart contracts.\u201c\nLombrozo added:\n\u201cAnd, of course, it also increases raw capacity by allowing for bigger blocks and making future block size increases more feasible.\u201d\n\nIt will now take another two-week difficulty period for the soft fork to actually activate. At that point, all SegWit-enforcing Bitcoin nodes, which almost certainly represents the majority of the Bitcoin ecosystem, will start rejecting any transactions and blocks that do not follow the new rules. As a backwards-compatible soft fork, however, this should not affect non-upgraded nodes much: These will continue to function as normal.", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 8}

Most participants speculated that Blockstream was about to implement the idea, promoted by Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik (among others), of a satellite system that streams the Bitcoin blockchain to the whole planet from space. The speculations were, indeed, correct.\nToday, the company is announcing Blockstream Satellite, a new service that broadcasts real-time Bitcoin blockchain data from satellites in space to almost everyone on the planet. Blockstream Satellite covers across two-thirds of the Earth\u2019s land mass and, according to the company, additional coverage areas will soon come online to reach almost every person on the planet by the end of the year. \n\u201cBitcoin is a powerful and transformative internet native digital money that has blazed a trail of disruption, with its full potential yet to unfold. Because it\u2019s permissionless, Bitcoin enables anyone to freely create new financial applications and other innovations that use the blockchain that haven\u2019t been possible before,\u201d said Blockstream co-founder and CEO Adam Back. \n\u201cToday\u2019s launch of Blockstream Satellite gives even more people on the planet the choice to participate in Bitcoin. With more users accessing the Bitcoin blockchain with the free broadcast from Blockstream Satellite, we expect the global reach to drive more adoption and use cases for Bitcoin, while strengthening the overall robustness of the network.\u201d \nThe Blockstream Satellite network currently consists of three geosynchronous satellites at various positions over Earth that cover four continents: Africa, Europe, South America and North America. Blockstream is leasing bandwidth on existing, commercial, geosynchronous satellites: Galaxy 18 (covering North America), Eutelsat 113 (covering South America) and two transponders on the Telstar 11N satellite (one covering Africa and one covering Europe). \nGround stations, called teleports, uplink the public Bitcoin blockchain data to the satellites in the network, which then broadcast the data to large areas across the globe. Additional satellites and teleports are being added to achieve worldwide coverage by the end of the year. \n\n\n\n\n\"When I first heard of Blockstream Satellite, I immediately recognized its great potential to bring Bitcoin to regions of the world where internet access is either unavailable or expensive,\u201d said Tim Akinbo, who runs the only bitcoin node in West Africa. \u201cNot to mention providing redundant access when internet access is temporarily unavailable.\" \nBlockstream Satellite uses GNU Radio, an open-source software development platform for Software-Defined Radio (SDR), expected to reduce costs and streamline development by eliminating the need for specialized hardware. Blockstream Satellite utilizes the Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine (FIBRE), an open-source protocol backed by several years of history operating and studying the Bitcoin Relay Network. \u201cTogether, these open-source technologies power the Blockstream Satellite network enabling Blockstream to provide this free service reliably and cost effectively,\u201d noted the Blockstream press release.\n\u201cAnyone can receive the signal with a small satellite dish (similar to a consumer satellite TV dish) and a USB SDR (software-defined radio) interface,\u201d notes the Blockstream Satellite FAQ. \u201cThe total equipment cost for a user is only about $100. The software is free. The software interface is the open-source GNU Radio software, which is the receiver.

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nA group of Ethereum Classic developers wants Ethereum Classic to be known as more than a \u201ccut-and-paste\u201d version of the Ethereum blockchain. So they spent seven months building Mantis, a unique Ethereum Classic client, from scratch.\nAnd it is not hard to understand their motivation. \nSince Ethereum Classic split away from Ethereum as a result of the DAO hard fork last summer, the two smart contract platforms have shared the same codebase, the same smart contract development tools and more. \nIn fact, aside from a few protocol changes, like defusing the difficulty bomb and capping the monetary policy on the Ethereum Classic chain, for all intents and purposes, the two networks have been nearly identical. \nBut now Ethereum Classic is striking out on its own in a move developers behind the effort hope will position the platform as a viable alternative to Ethereum. Earlier this week, Alan McSherry, Ethereum Classic developer and Mantis project lead, announced the beta version of the new Ethereum Classic client in a blog post. \nBuilt in the functional programming language Scala, Mantis represents a serious effort by the Ethereum Classic community to gain recognition for having its own team of developers on par with those of Ethereum. Mantis also sets the foundation for future innovations in Ethereum Classic.\n\u201cThis is a good starting point for our influence in the Ethereum Classic community,\u201d said McSherry, in speaking with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe are able to say we have built from the ground up a client in Scala. And, when it comes to the future direction of Ethereum Classic, we have a pretty good handle on what we are talking about.\u201d\nBut before getting into why the developers of the project chose to build a client in Scala, first, what is a client?\nA Blockchain Client\nIn a distributed ledger, a client refers to the software that runs on a computer, or \u201cnode,\u201d connected to the network. A blockchain client is responsible for downloading and keeping up to date an entire copy of the blockchain. In a sense, it also acts like a server in that it also serves the other nodes in the network by doing things like verifying blocks, checking that transactions include signatures and so on. \u00a0\nIn that respect, Mantis essentially represents a full end-to-end copy of Ethereum. It contains the mining verification algorithm, the consensus algorithm, all the network logic, the cryptography that allows users to spend their coins and the logic to verify smart contracts. \nAs a client, Mantis also provides interfaces for creating transactions. Still in beta, Mantis supports a command-line interface version of a wallet for making transactions. Users can also access the client from the Mist browser over HTTP. \u00a0\nTo be clear, Mantis is not the only client available to Ethereum Classic users. Other groups may be working on other clients, said McSherry. And the Ethereum Classic community maintains two other Ethereum clients: Geth, written in Go, and Parity, written in Rust. But McSherry explained that the hope is that Mantis will eventually become the flagship client for Ethereum Classic. \nFunctional Language\nMantis is different from existing Ethereum clients in that it was written in Scala, a functional programming language. \nScala is touted for benefits that include ease of testing and predictability, characteristics that allow developers to audit the code for bugs and security flaws more easily than other languages. \u201cIf you have more predictable code, that will leverage itself up to the overall quality of the product,\u201d McSherry said. \u00a0\u00a0\nBut there are levels of functional languages. Scala is more of a hybrid language that sits between heavyweight functional languages, like Haskell and OCaml, that draw the academic and science crowd and the user-friendly world of Java. \nAnd this means that while Scala allows developers to write in a functional style, it still has a fairly easy learning curve, making it accessible to a broad community of developers who may want to contribute to the open-source code. \nMcSherry explained that because Scala is a functional language, it is also open to applying frameworks, such as Stainless, that use rigorous mathematical proofs to check that the code performs as intended. It is a theme that plays well in the Ethereum Classic community\u2019s stance on immutability and the idea that if \u201ccode is law\u201d then smart contracts need to run in a more secure environment.\n\u201cThe ultimate goal is a much higher-quality code, and obviously, that means much higher security for the funds that are controlled,\u201d McSherry said. \nMoving Forward \nIn terms of a road map for Ethereum Classic, Mantis is a stepping stone to bigger things and perhaps a greater technical divergence from Ethereum. \nFor instance, plans are to eventually connect Mantis to IOHK\u2019s cryptocurrency wallet platform Daedalus, giving Mantis a graphical interface. \u201cThat\u2019s the next focus,\u201d McSherry said.\nBut for now, Mantis is being made available to other developers who are willing to try out the code in a testnet environment and provide their feedback. \n\u201cWe are delighted to have gotten to this stage where we have the functionality out the door,\u201d says McSherry. \u201cThe next phase is to polish the functionality, look at the performance of it, go back and clean up, and make it a top, top client.\u201d\nHe said he expects the next release of Mantis as soon as September.", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 11}

She has been writing about technology for nearly two decades. You can follow her @girlandgrowl on Twitter.\nSome confusion still exists around Bitcoin Cash (or Bcash), the new token that resulted from a split in the Bitcoin network on August 1. Many bitcoin (BTC) holders are still wondering how to safely remove the new tokens (BCH) from exchanges (and wallets) without putting their BTC at risk.\nIn a recent episode of the Crypto Show, Paul Snow, the founder of the blockchain-based data management solution Factom, offered some suggestions. He also talked about the potential benefits of holding onto BCH a little while longer. \nFirst, while some exchanges may be offering to extract BCH for some users, Snow firmly advises people not to hand over their private keys to exchanges. He thinks sharing private keys is a bad policy in general. \u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt is kind of like, you don\u2019t wear underwear on the outside of your pants; you don\u2019t give people your private keys,\u201d he said. But for those anxious to cash in on their BCH right away, he describes a safe way to do it.\nCreate New Addresses \nSnow suggests users separate their BTC from their BCH first, as follows: \nIf you had any number of addresses holding BTC before August 1, then you will now have an equal amount of BCH on those same addresses.\nSnow recommends you go into your BTC wallets and move the entire amounts of BTC in those addresses, (imagine three addresses we\u2019ll call A, B, C) to three new addresses (D, E, F). Now, the second set of addresses (D, E, F) will have BTC in them, but no BCH because those addresses did not exist before August 1. The first set (A, B, C) will have BCH in them, but no BTC. \n\u201cTo reiterate,\u201d Snow said, \u201cmove your Bitcoin addresses from where they were on August 1 to new addresses. Step two, input those private keys into your Bitcoin Cash wallet. Step three, profit,\u201d he said. \n\nFor more info on how to handle your BCH safely, read A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Claiming Your Bitcoin Cash (and Selling It).\n\nNeutral on Bcash\nBitcoin Cash has, in a sense, divided the community. Some like Bitcoin Cash because it raises the Bitcoin block size limit to 8MB, while others are appalled at how the new chain is attempting to usurp users and hashpower from the main Bitcoin network. \nSnow maintains a neutral stance. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I have an opinion on any particular blockchain out there,\u201d he said. \nAfter all, Bitcoin is not the only game in town. He pointed out that right now there are nine cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin with a market cap of $1B or more. Those are the facts. \u201cI don\u2019t care whether you think Bitcoin should be the only blockchain or not. They [those other coins] exist,\u201d he said\nMoveover, he thinks Bitcoin Cash played fair and square in launching an alternative currency. Everyone who had BTC got their share of BCH in the airdrop. Nevertheless, nearly everyone he hears from is looking to reinvest that money back into BTC. \n\u201cI am seeing a lot of people who are going to cash out on the Bitcoin Cash as fast as they can and buy Bitcoin with it,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\u201cHodling\u201d Bcash\nOf course, there is another option. People could hold onto (or \u201chodl\u201d) their BCH just like they hold on to their BTC and see if the price goes up. \nAfter all, Snow said the market for BCH won\u2019t hit its stride until mid September when the mining difficulty on the new chain eases up to the point where Bitcoin miners consider it economically viable to redirect their hash power over to it. \n\u201cRight now, anyone mining on Bitcoin Cash now is effectively donating their power,\u201d he said. \u201cThat [Bitcoin Cash] bandwagon doesn\u2019t leave town until September 18th. Until then, it is just kind of puddling along and not quite getting anywhere.\u201d\nDropping Anchor \nBut, say the Bitcoin Cash chain were to beat all odds and become super successful. If that were to happen, would Factom anchor onto the Bitcoin Cash chain instead of the Bitcoin chain?\nTo explain Snow\u2019s business, Factom is a protocol that runs on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. By doing so, it allows any kind of data to be time-stamped and secured using the Bitcoin blockchain. So hashrate is essential to Factom\u2019s security.\n\u201cWe are anchoring into a chain for its proof of work,\u201d Snow said. \u201cBut if proof of work is largely in Bitcoin Cash, then we will anchor onto Bitcoin Cash.\u201d\nHe added that if the hashrate between the two chains were to split 60/40, Factom could anchor on both chains and still get 100 percent of the hashpower. \n\u201cWe can anchor as many chains as we want,\u201d he said, but added that he doesn\u2019t think Bitcoin Cash will ever capture that much hashpower. With BCH currently only valued at less than one tenth of BTC, the economic rewards for miners just aren\u2019t there. \nBut as Snow pointed out, all of this plays into Bitcoin\u2019s security. \u201cBitcoin is designed so that it is very, very hard to split off and be successful,\u201d Snow said. \nDuring the course of the interview, Snow also discussed the mechanics of how Factom anchors onto the Bitcoin network and the third annual Texas Bitcoin Conference, which he founded and helps organize. The conference will take place from October 28-29. \nListen to the entire podcast here.\n", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 14}

One largely untapped investment group would be a \u201cfamily office\u201d (FO), which is a private wealth manager of investments and trusts for ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs). In 2015, UHNWIs included almost 173,000 individuals whose wealth accounted for $20.8 trillion. FOs can represent a single-family office (SFO) or multi-family office (MFO), with the former being the largest group that represents one extremely wealthy single family.\nThe Family Office Databases reports that most FOs reside in the United States.\n\nAccording to UBS and Global Wealth, the top three investments of an average FO portfolio are in the developed market, real estate, or venture capital and private equities.\n\nCryptocurrencies would be classified as a commodity, whereas initial coin offerings (ICOs) would represent venture capital. Furthermore, most ICOs are deemed securities based on the parameters of the Howey\u00a0test. Cryptocurrencies themselves are still very new and highly complex, and innovation is happening every day. Few people understand them deeply due to the intense learning curve.\nBeing decentralized and transparent on a blockchain with low transaction fees means cryptocurrencies have attractive properties for UHNWIs. Cryptocurrencies provide FOs with diversification from traditional assets usually in an average portfolio. However, the risk of investing remains high, especially if there is a lack of understanding around how cryptocurrencies work or how to secure them properly. \nThe recent explosion of ICOs and ICO funding represents a growing percentage of investors backing the creation of software or companies that are building the technology and infrastructure. David Drake, managing partner of LDJ capital, whose focus is on compliance and underwriting for ICOs, said to Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cThese ICOs need to have a real team and business structure behind them before anyone is willing to invest.\u201d \nDrake added that many investors he speaks with \u201care afraid that they will not understand what is happening with cryptocurrencies, but this is changing very quickly as they become curious about the subject.\u201d\n\nProjects that will be able to cut through the noise and hype with a clear message and identifiable use cases will likely acquire more investors through an ICO. Two such examples of successful ICOs with straightforward use cases include Civic, a project focused on providing proof of identity, which raised $33 million; and Filecoin, a decentralized storage network, which raised $252 million.\nGenerally, ICOs accept funds through cryptocurrencies only, although this may change to bring in more investors.

Lines\nAcross the length of the bullish push from the $2700s (the 61% line) there are signs of sustained momentum in the RSI and MACD. \u00a0Looking at the volume profile, there is no clear decline in volume and it appears to show market interest in higher values as the volume\u2019s moving average has remained mostly flat. \u00a0However, since the bullish push from the $3200s (the 38% line) we can see signs of bullish exhaustion in the form MACD and RSI divergence. \u00a0\nZooming in on a smaller timescale, we see evidence of a higher push to new all time highs:\nFigure 2: \u00a0BTC-USD, 1-Hour Candles, Bitfinex, Potential Bull Pennant Breakout\nAt the top of BTC-USD\u2019s strong run from the $3200s stands a classic bullish continuation pattern called a \u201cBull Pennant.\u201d \u00a0The pennant is characterized by price consolidation within a convergent pattern and has decreasing volume throughout the length of the pennant body. \u00a0To accompany this pattern is a 1-hour RSI and MACD that began to consolidate toward its centerline.\nAt the time of this article, BTC-USD appears to have broken out of this pennant with a sharp increase in volume. \u00a0Currently, based on typical price projections for Bull Pennant breakouts, this pennant breakout has a price target of $5000.\nAlthough this is a rather aggressive price target for this bull pennant, there are some considerations on a macro scale that should be addressed and discussed.\nFigure 3: \u00a0BTC-USD, 1 Day Candles, Bitfinex, Bollinger Bands\nFor the fourth day in a row, BTC-USD continues to push outside the Bollinger Bands. \u00a0Historically, this sort of push has led to market pullback or consolidation. \u00a0Even on high timescales, the current 3-day candle (not shown above) is fully formed outside the Bollinger Bands and shows, on a macro scale, that the market is overbought. \u00a0To accompany this push of the Bollinger Bands, a clear decrease in volume is seen on the moving average that shows, since the rise from $1800s, there has been waning bullish sentiment. \u00a0\nWhile there is a lot of hype surrounding BTC\u2019s recent rise, it is paramount to remain objective and skeptical of market activity and to view the market soberly. \u00a0The price target of $5000, on a micro level seems plausible. \u00a0However, on a macro level the bullish market appears to have slightly bearish divergence. \u00a0To remain a reliable price target, the market needs to see a push to newer all time highs accompanied by increase in volume to sustain the next $800 of price movement.\nSummary:\nBTC-USD has broken out of a bullish continuation pattern called a \u201cBull Pennant\u201d with a price target of $5,000.On a macro scale, there are signs of bullish momentum loss in the form of bearish divergence and overbought signals on the Bollinger Bands. \u00a0While the market can remain overbought for days and weeks, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the higher the market pushes into overbought zones, the more necessary market consolidation becomes in order to prevent a market pullback. \u00a0So far, there has yet to be any considerable market consolidation during this 130% rise.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Yesterday, it finally did with its announcement that virtual tokens like the ones sold by the DAO are securities and now subject to federal securities laws.\nThe SEC statements reads in part: \u201cfederal securities laws apply to those who offer and sell securities in the United States, regardless whether the issuing entity is a traditional company or a decentralized autonomous organization, regardless whether those securities are purchased using U.S. dollars or virtual currencies, and regardless whether they are distributed in certificated form or through distributed ledger technology.\u201d\nThe SEC is cautioning investors not only to be aware of the risks but also to ensure that those looking to get involved do their own due diligence as well. \nOne important distinction that seems to have emerged in the report, however, is that while DAO tokens are securities, Ether itself is still in the clear.\nThe Report seems to distinguish between Ether, labeled a virtual currency, and DAO Tokens, labeled a security. Market participants may take comfort in this distinction, as it supports the view that not all blockchain tokens are securities under the U.S. Federal Securities Laws. - Devebois & Plimpton LLC\nThe announcement, nevertheless, is expected to have an impact on token sales. As a result of this recent development, it is important to note that any company looking to raise capital through ICOs in the U.S. will have to take this SEC decision into consideration. \nOn the legal side,\u00a0Louis Lehot\u00a0of DLA Piper told Bitcoin Magazine: \u201cThose considering a token offering would be well served to reconsider their plans and ensure compliance in all of these areas, from tip to tail.\u201d\nLehot said: \u201cThe SEC\u2019s release is most notable on its survey of many of the corollary issues which can be triggered under the federal securities laws when a token is deemed a security, from registration or exemption, whether general solicitation is permissible, to crowdfunding, to after-market trading and even addressed compliance issues under the 1940 Act.\u201d\nWhat Is \u201cThe Howey Test\u201d?\nThe Howey test is the leading definition of an investment contract, referring to the U.S. Supreme Court case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.\u00a0Under the Howey test, an investment contract is \u201ca contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.\u201d\nAccording to Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of stealth blockchain project WORKFLOW and former investment banker, \u201cThe standard test is an investment in a business where the buyer has a reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others. It should come as no surprise that the SEC found that buyers of the DAO Token purchased a security.\u201d\nHe explained that the key feature of the DAO token was indeed an expectation of profit if the investments made by the DAO were successful, and so DAO tokens were expressly sold as an investment. \u00a0\nLukasiewicz added: \u201cUnlike a token such as Ether, the DAO token had no other utility. \u00a0Many people in the industry at the time were concerned about the DAO for the reasons stated by SEC.\u201d\nMarco Santori, partner at Cooley LLP and legal ambassador for the Delaware Blockchain Initiative, shared an excellent summary of the report's key points on Twitter, touching chiefly on the distinction between tokens that are and are not securities.\n\nArnold Spencer acts as general counsel for the Coinsource network of Bitcoin ATMs.\u00a0He summed up the distinction in a succinct analogy:\nIf you buy an interest in a golf course to make money from the business, it is a financial investment and therefore a security. If you join a golf club to play golf, it is not a financial investment and not a security.\nImportant \u2014 but Not Surprising\nRon Chernesky, CEO of social trading platform investFeed, said that he welcomes the SEC announcement, although he also noted that \u201cbefore yesterday\u2019s announcement, it was common knowledge that ICOs have been enveloped in a regulatory [gray] area.\u201d\nIt would appear that that gray area has now shrunk somewhat.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 26}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAt the recent State of Digital Money event in Los Angeles, Bitcoin scaling was the topic of conversation for a panel consisting of Airbitz CEO Paul Puey, derivatives trader Tone Vays, Yours CEO Ryan X. Charles and Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo. During the panel discussion, each participant was able to share his vision for how Bitcoin should be scaled to handle a much larger userbase.\nCiphrex CEO and Bitcoin Core Contributor Eric Lombrozo\nFor Lombrozo, scaling Bitcoin is about getting the greatest gains in terms of throughput increases while also limiting the amount of risk and security vulnerabilities involved in those improvements.\n\u201cObviously, if you have just a few entities that are validating the transactions for everyone, then that creates a point of attack or a single point of failure,\u201d said Lombrozo. \u201cPart of the whole philosophy of Bitcoin is you should be able to validate your own transactions.\u201d\nLombrozo added that scaling Bitcoin means users are able to validate their own transactions without necessarily being forced to validate everyone else\u2019s transactions as well.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the trick,\u201d said Lombrozo.\nAn example of this method of scaling Bitcoin is the Lightning Network, in addition to other Layer 2 protocols.\nFrom Lombrozo\u2019s perspective, using a blockchain for every transaction is like going to court every time a deal is made with a counterparty. The Lightning Network allows users to interact directly rather than dealing with the blockchain as a third party of sorts to process the transaction.\nIn the past, Joseph Poon, who is a co-author of the original Lightning Network white paper, has shared similar comments related to the use of Bitcoin\u2019s underlying blockchain as a court for smart contracts.\n\u201cInstead of viewing [the blockchain] as simply a payment system, if you view it as a smart contracting system, which enables the blockchain to act as a dispute mediation system, viewing the blockchain as a judge is a lot more understandable and a lot more powerful,\u201d said Poon at the 2016 MIT Bitcoin Expo.\nLombrozo added that second-layer protocols like the Lightning Network act as a sort of paper IOU to bitcoin\u2019s gold \u2014 except in the case of the Lightning Network, the user knows they will always be able to redeem the paper for gold.\nIn addition to Layer 2 protocols, Lombrozo would also like to see different signature schemes implemented in Bitcoin to lower the resource requirements of operating a full node. Schnorr signatures are an example of such an improvement that has been in development for Bitcoin.\nAnother key point made by Lombrozo during the panel discussion was that different players in the Bitcoin ecosystem desire different features in the protocol; for example, long-term holders may not care as much about $10 on-chain transaction fees as those who have built businesses around the use of the blockchain for coffee purchases or other low-value transactions.\nIn summary, Lombrozo referred to a user\u2019s ability to only need to validate their own transactions (while still remaining secure) as the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of scaling Bitcoin.\nYours CEO Ryan X. Charles\nWhile Charles claimed he was happy to see progress made on the eventual activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) via the activation of BIP 91, he also added, \u201cSegWit doesn\u2019t go far enough.\u201d\nFrom Charles\u2019s perspective, SegWit will not sufficiently lower on-chain transaction fees, which he sees as the key issue for users at this time. In his view, much lower on-chain transaction fees are needed for mainstream adoption of Bitcoin to occur.\nAccording to Charles, the main disagreement between various parties when it comes to the best way to scale Bitcoin has to do with how much transactional activity should happen on the blockchain, as opposed to secondary layers of the network.\n\u201cI am very much in favor of radical increases to the block size,\u201d said Charles.\nCharles added that it would take 30 years to send every person in the world a bitcoin transaction with the current 1MB block size limit.\n\u201cThat just doesn\u2019t work from the point of view of mainstream adoption of bitcoin,\u201d said Charles.\nCharles also noted that the Lightning Network white paper stated that a 130MB block size limit would be necessary for mainstream adoption to be possible, even with various Layer 2 scaling options.\nAccording to Charles, the key question to answer is: How does Bitcoin get from 1MB to 10GB blocks?\n\u201cComputers get faster and cheaper,\u201d said Charles. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just have to be technical software and cryptographic optimizations.\u201d\nDerivatives Trader Tone Vays\nWhen Vays spoke about his vision for scaling Bitcoin, he first noted that the digital cash system may not be able to do all of the things that were promised in the early days. He specifically mentioned privacy, security, instant transactions and cheap payments as examples of features that were promised by Bitcoin enthusiasts back in 2013.\n\u201cIn reality, having all of those things at once is almost impossible,\u201d said Vays. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance Bitcoin can\u2019t do all that.\u201d\nVays reiterated Lombrozo\u2019s point about different users wanting different features in Bitcoin. In his view, the censorship-resistant properties of the system should be viewed with the highest level of priority.\n\u201cThe reality is a censorship-resistant payment method is way more important,\u201d said Vays. \u201cYou have so many other ways to pay for your cup of coffee, but you don\u2019t have a lot of ways to donate to Wikileaks. You don\u2019t have a lot of ways to buy \u201cother\u201d things...\u201d\nLast year, Vays published a post on his blog where he examined some of these use cases involving censorship resistance.\nVays added that he trusts the current group of contributors to Bitcoin Core, the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, to focus on this priority of censorship-resistant digital cash.\nFor Vays, the next area of focus for developers after the activation of SegWit should be privacy-focused improvements, such as MimbleWimble and Confidential Transactions.\nAirbitz CEO Paul Puey\nBefore talking about anything else, Puey stated that he is very much for the activation of SegWit. However, he then shared his belief that much more on-chain capacity is needed on the Bitcoin network, as Charles had previously stated.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to live with a 1MB block, and it was an arbitrary number,\u201d said Puey.\nPuey added that computers are now four to five times more powerful than when the block size limit was originally added to Bitcoin by the system\u2019s creator. He also indicated that the correct \u201cmagical number\u201d to define the block size limit is hard to figure out, which is why he believes the free market should decide.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the developers should make that decision,\u201d said Puey.\nPuey did not elaborate on how the free market would be able to make this decision. It\u2019s unclear if he was talking about Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s concept of emergent consensus or simply users choosing between different blockchains with different block size limits.\nThe Airbitz CEO then prefaced the rest of his comments with the fact that he still has a tremendous amount of respect for the people who have been contributing to Bitcoin Core over the years as they\u2019re trying to solve an incredibly hard problem.\nPuey noted that he, as a developer, knows his limitations when it comes to developing a proper user experience for software applications.\n\u201cHow many of you people want the developers designing the user experience of your protocol, your application [or] your website?\u201d Puey asked the audience.\nIn Puey\u2019s view, the idea that every Bitcoin user is going to run their own full node, even at a 1MB block size limit, creates a flawed user experience and will prevent the technology from being adopted by the masses.\n\u201cEvery party in this debate wants decentralization, but they all define it differently,\u201d Puey added.\nWhile Puey suggested that more users running their own full nodes is helpful, he also shared his belief that having greater adoption of bitcoin as a currency would also help the system become more resilient to attackers.\n\u201cThe more people that are using it, the more that the economy is dependent on it, the harder it is to stomp out a technology,\u201d said Puey.\nPuey concluded his response to the scaling question by stating that he was happy to see BIP 91 help end the stagnation in the adoption of protocol improvements.\nThe full panel discussion was streamed on Periscope by Civic Business Development Manager Vivek Kasarabada and can be viewed in its entirety here.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 26}

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nLast week, startup company Lotos published its new project on Reddit aiming to create a decentralized religious community, supporting Buddhism and meditation, based on the Ethereum blockchain. According to the company\u2019s white paper, the community\u2019s structure will be segmented into three parts: \u201can off-blockchain software platform\u201d connecting the teachers and the students; \u201can internal economy supported by ERC20 tokens purchased by subscription fees and a central banker smart contract;\u201d and \u201ca website anddatabase backend connected to the network with Swarm.\u201d\nThe ERC20 compatible Karma (KRM) token will be used for on-platform exchanges and for crowdfunding the development of the platform. In addition to that, if users are able to grow the network, they will receive KRM as a reward.\nThe company believes they can create a blockchain-based community by combining science and religion in a radical way. There is even a statement from Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, included in the whitepaper:\n\u201cIf scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false\u2026 then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims.\u201d\nThe Lotos community will be divided into two parts: students and teachers. Teachers will be either elected or assigned by the company\u2019s owner. They offer religious services for the students including \u201cfacilitating student retention and progress,\u201d creating content for the network and \u201crecruiting\u201d new students. The teachers will earn Karma tokens for their activities. \nOn the other hand, the students can freely register into the community, although, for a price. Lotos will allow students to join \u201ctemples\u201d and classes but they have to pay KRM tokens to do so. Furthermore, there is \u201cKarma-gated\u201d content, which is only available if certain students pay a flat monthly subscription fee. Students can also earn KRM bonuses if they meditate, the more regular their activity is, the more bonuses they can earn, the whitepaper detailed.\nWhen Lotos published its whitepaper in the Ethereum community on Reddit, they received hard criticism. Most of the users argue that Buddhism does not comply with materialism.\n\u201cI think \u2018searching meaning beyond materialism\u2019 and material \u2018reward of spiritual practice\u2019 don't mix together very well. Just a thought,\u201d one user wrote.\n\u201cDude what you are doing is not Buddhism it's Opportunism. Buddhism is about Simplicity, you are leading people into Complexity. Basically with your System people's Incentive to meditate IS TO MAKE MONEY (NOT LIBERATION),\u201d another user wrote on Reddit.\nOthers in the community suspect that the whole project, which is planning to launch an ICO, is a scam or some sort of money grab.\n\u201cHere's the problem man: you are coming out with an ICO right at a time when the inherent corruption in ICOs is very much a public thing. I like the idea of a decentralized meditation app, I really do. However the fact that you are doing an ICO for \u2018decentralized religion\u2019 on something that isn't non-profit ESPECIALLY BUDDHISM screams scam, and I believe it is one. If this is really your passion to help people around the world learn to meditate and become spiritual, you wouldn't have a for-profit business model. Without a non-profit, you really don't have a leg to stand on when it comes to spirituality,\u201d a user named \u201cPJBRed27\u201d said about the project.\nSurprisingly, it seems the negative opinions on the project made Lotos change some of the concepts of the project:\n\u201cWe are changing direction a bit now:\nRemove ICO mention from all marketing material / stop the crowd-fund campaign and work on building our community.Start playing the slow and steady \u2018snowball going down a mountain\u2019 game.Write blog posts at least once per week, each post highlights one of the community's biggest concerns with our project (like why we need ERC20 tokens).This also gives us time to find both blockchain and buddhist advisors.Move away from 'Buddhist\u2019 to \u2018Secular Meditation\u2019.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 24}

The license will allow the company to provide clearing services for fully collateralized digital currency swaps for the first time. On July 6, the CFTC also granted LedgerX an order of registration as a Swap Execution Facility. The company, which was founded in 2013, already received a temporary approval as a Swap Execution Facility in 2015.\nDespite the approval, the CFTC highlighted that LedgerX\u2019s current authorization \u201cdoes not constitute or imply a Commission endorsement of the use of digital currency generally, or bitcoin specifically.\u201d The Commission added that, along with the approval, it had issued a letter on July 24 exempting LedgerX from \u201ccertain regulations\u201d implied by the CFTC due to the firm\u2019s fully collateralized clearing model.\nBy obtaining a DCO license, LedgerX will be able to provide specific services on the company\u2019s platform to participants, including obtaining and hedging bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by using exchange-traded and centrally cleared option contracts. With the regulatory approval, the company expects to list one- to six-month options contracts for bitcoin in addition to adding contracts for other cryptocurrencies, such as ETH options.\n\u201cA U.S. federally regulated venue for derivative contracts settling in digital currencies opens the market to a much larger customer base,\u201d Paul L. Chou, the CEO of LedgerX, said in a statement. \u201cWe are seeing strong demand from institutions that previously could not participate in the bitcoin market due to compliance restrictions against unregulated venues. In particular, there is a desire for fund managers to hold financial instruments that are not correlated with the broader equity market, and digital currencies meet that need.\u201d\nLedgerX is planning to provide required services, such as surveillance and transparency, for institutional investors. According to the company, participants eligible for LedgerX\u2019s services include registered broker dealers, banks, futures commission merchants, qualified commodity pool entities and qualified high-net-worth investors.\n\u201cThese are exciting times to have a new digital asset class emerge.

LedgerX secured $11.4 million of funding in May, led by Miami International Holdings Inc. and China\u2019s Huiyin Blockchain Venture Investments, to acquire the clearing license from the CFTC.\n\u201cLedgerX\u2019s registration is a historic milestone for derivatives and for digital currencies. To me, it is equivalent to the launch of currency futures back in 1972 that heralded the beginning of exchange-traded and cleared derivatives based on financial products,\u201d Gary DeWaal of Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP, one of the companies assisting LedgerX during its CFTC application process, said in a statement.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 26}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nLamassu is a bitcoin ATM manufacturer that started in 2013 with the goal of making it \u201cas simple as possible to get bitcoin.\u201d There are now hundreds of these bitcoin ATMs around the world, and one of Lamassu\u2019s co-founders, Zach Harvey, recently shared some data related to how these machines are used at a Bitcoin meetup in Milan.\nWhile a recent article in the New York Post warned bodega owners against putting bitcoin ATMs in their stores due to potential use by darknet market customers, Harvey stated his belief that most of the bitcoin ATM users are using the devices for speculation on the bitcoin price, which he sees as the biggest use case for the digital asset right now.\nAccording to Harvey, Lamassu set up their business in a decentralized, distributed manner where they manufacture the machines in Portugal and then sell them to operators around the world.\n\u201cThe reason we did this in a way that is more distributed is because we felt the system would be a lot more robust if every one of these individual operators ran the machines themselves, had their own bitcoin wallets from which to send to the end user, had full control over their user data, there would be no single point of failure, and it would also be more in the spirit of Bitcoin,\u201d said Harvey at the recent meetup.\nHarvey went on to discuss data related to the use of bitcoin ATMs, problems associated with increased congestion on the Bitcoin network, and a specific example of why he thinks bitcoin is going mainstream.\nWho Uses Bitcoin ATMs?\nAccording to Harvey, the people who use bitcoin ATMs are mostly non-tech savvy users who want to get their first taste of digital currency. Harvey added that bitcoin ATMs tend to attract these types of users due to a focus on convenience and user experience. The Lamassu co-founder also claimed that a new user can complete a transaction in 20 to 30 seconds, while someone familiar with the machine can be done in less than ten seconds.\nTwo of the key selling points of bitcoin ATMs mentioned by Harvey were that users don\u2019t have to go through the process of connecting a bank account with an exchange and the machines can feel like a safer option than meeting up with a random person found on a P2P bitcoin trading marketplace like LocalBitcoins.\nAccording to Harvey, the selling points of bitcoin ATMs are so strong that many people are willing to pay the 10 to 15 percent exchange fees that come with them. He claimed that the more popular bitcoin ATMs get around 50 transactions per day and \u201csometimes you\u2019ll even have queue at some of the machines.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re around a bitcoin ATM, there really is no easier way of [getting some bitcoin],\u201d Harvey later added.\nHaving said that, Harvey indicated that many of the bitcoin ATMs in the United States include some sort of identity verification due to Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering regulations. The level of identity verification required tends to vary, depending on the amounts involved and where the bitcoin ATM is located.\nHarvey also shared data from one of their operators, who owns 14 machines, that indicated these bitcoin ATMs tend to be used for low-value transactions.\n\u201cThese are people that just want to get the first experience \u2014 see what it\u2019s like to get into bitcoin,\u201d said Harvey. \u201cIf they really just want to see what it\u2019s about \u2014 feel a little bit of the magic of bitcoin \u2014 they\u2019re going to start with a low amount.\u201d\n\u201cIf you look at machine number 13, there\u2019s almost 90 percent of transactions that are under $100,\u201d Harvey added.\nAccording to the data shared by Harvey, 20 to 30 percent of the transactions at these particular bitcoin ATMs are for less than $10.\n\n\n\nNetwork Transaction Fees Have an Effect on Bitcoin ATMs\nDuring his appearance at the Bitcoin meetup in Milan, Harvey also discussed the effect that increased congestion on the Bitcoin network has had on bitcoin ATMs. He noted that operators asked for the functionality to add a flat fee or the complete removal of the $5 and $10 transaction amounts when on-chain transaction fees get into the $1\u2013$2 range.\nHarvey also noted that roughly 90 percent of the transactions that are usually processed by bitcoin ATMs would become uneconomical if on-chain bitcoin transaction fees reached $10.\nDue to demand from their operators, Lamassu plans to add altcoins, such as ether and zcash, to their machines in the coming weeks. These altcoins feature shorter confirmation times, which can be helpful in situations where a user wants to trade their cryptocurrency for physical cash.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as secure as a bitcoin confirmation, but it\u2019s more secure than a zero-confirmation of bitcoin,\u201d Harvey said of confirmations on other cryptocurrency networks.\nDue to Bitcoin network congestion and poorly implemented fee estimation software on users\u2019 mobile wallets, Harvey noted that some users have had to wait over a day to get their cash out of a bitcoin ATM.\nIn terms of unconfirmed bitcoin transactions, Harvey stated that not many operators have had issues with accepting them.\nBitcoin Going Mainstream?\nAlthough Lamassu also has machines in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Canada has become their most active userbase. According to data shared by Harvey, the Toronto area alone has around 50 Lamassu bitcoin ATMs.\n\u201cSeveral years ago, [this] would have seemed like way too many, and now it\u2019s starting to be something that\u2019s the norm as bitcoin goes more mainstream,\u201d said Harvey of the density of bitcoin ATMs in Toronto.\nWhen sharing data related to the proliferation of Lamassu\u2019s bitcoin ATMs around the world, Harvey showed a screenshot of an email he received from a convenience store owner in Toronto.\n\n\n\u201cCustomers are coming into my store, and they\u2019re telling me, \u2018Why don\u2019t you have a bitcoin ATM?\u2019\u201d Harvey paraphrased from the email. \u201cCan I please get one placed here?\u201d \nThis is the same area that already has roughly 50 bitcoin ATMs around it.\nWatch the full presentation here.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 25}

Fintech communities and universities in 11 regions have agreed to participate including McGill University and the Richard Ivey School of Business in Canada; UC Berkeley, Wake Forest University and St. Petersburg in the United States; University of Queensland in Australia; Trivandrum and Bangalore in India; St. Petersburg in Russia; and Puerto Rico and Colombia.\nThe first airdrop event begins on August 11 in Colombia, where Jorge P\u00e9rez, the director of BEN Colombia, is hosting a meeting at a restaurant. The airdrop then moves to St. Petersburg in Russia on August 16, where the giveaway is being held in unison with the ICO-Hypethon, an ICO-focused hackathon where blockchain developers will build infrastructure around ICOs to pitch to investors. The airdrop will continue on to other campuses and cities until the network has distributed the entire amount of donations.\nRodion Mikhalev, the director of BEN Russia and one of the organizers of the ICO-Hypethon, explained in a statement that \u201cthe Hypethon is a mix between a hackathon [and] an accelerator. It\u2019s a 48-hour event hosted by Crypto Friends, where Eberhard Lindfordt will screen the top 20 projects out of hundreds of applicants. Teams chosen will receive help from experienced [b]lockchain experts which will help them finalize their business and lead them into successful ICO launches. \n\u201cThere will also be ICO angels ready to invest their money into projects on the spot and whom will receive additional bonus coins if done so at the event. This is the perfect event in Russia to host the airdrop and to distribute bitcoins to the hundreds of innovators who will pass by in the 48-hour window, and we are excited to participate in it! This is a very rare and exciting opportunity which will attract some of Russia\u2019s best talent and will pave the way to a better future worldwide.\u201d \nAlberto Jauregui, the director of growth of the Blockchain Education Network, said in a statement that he believes the \u201cBitcoin Airdrop serves as an engine to introduce students to the disruptive blockchain industry and incentivize them to band together to form new BEN chapters or regions.\u201d \nLast year, Jauregui hosted a small airdrop outside the main library at the University of South Florida and hid paper wallets throughout the campus. This year, he plans to coordinate an airdrop alongside a BitCrawl on Central Avenue in St. Petersburg, Florida. The date is to be announced. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t like free Bitcoin?\u201d Jauregui added. BitCrawl is an event started in Montreal by the McGill Students Cryptocurrency Club and then continued by the Decentralized Tech Association at the University of Toronto, in which a main street agrees to accept bitcoin for an evening and a group of blockchain enthusiasts go between different venues.\nHigh schools are also going to be giving away bitcoin at this airdrop. Sunrose Billing, the director of BEN\u2019s high school network, said in a statement to Bitcoin Magazine that \u201cblockchain [technology] and cryptocurrencies are really taking off and will absolutely continue to grow at a rapid pace. That\u2019s clear when you see teenagers day trading, analyzing macro landscapes and taking the time to educate themselves about innovation in this space in their spare time.\u201d Billing plans to airdrop bitcoin to his friends at University of Toronto School, a high school in Toronto, and he expects that many of his friends at other high schools will join this year\u2019s event.\nThe title sponsor of the event is bitJob, a decentralized marketplace based on blockchain technology that connects students with part-time work. BitJob has already partnered with many of the blockchain clubs at the participating campuses of the airdrop, including McGill University and the Richard Ivey School of Business, that have agreed to seed the marketplace with the first students looking for work on projects that can help them become fully employed in the blockchain industry. \n\u201cIt is a true honor to be sponsoring the 2017 Blockchain Education Network\u2019s Global Bitcoin Airdrop across university campuses. BitJob shares a similar mandate with BEN to empower students and give them the necessary tools to compete in today\u2019s marketplace. This year\u2019s event is shaping up to be the largest ever as the popularity of Bitcoin and [b]lockchain [technology] continues to rise globally,\u201d said Dror Medalion, co-founder and CEO of bitJob, in a statement to Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe airdrop is being supported by blockchain media firms Blockchain TV and BTC Media, digital identity startup DIID and blockchain consulting and development firm MLG Blockchain. \n\u201cI am very excited to be a sponsor in this year\u2019s Blockchain Education Network\u2019s global Bitcoin Airdrop 2017. BEN is a driving force behind empowering the youth of tomorrow, which makes for a great story to tell!\u201d said James Gonzalez, co-founder and CEO of Blockchain TV, in a statement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 25}

It will also simplify the tracking and management of information by recording all shareholder transactions. \nCommenting on the deal to Bitcoin Magazine, Ed Clark, senior press officer at the LSE, said, \u201cIt has the potential to allow private SMEs [small- and medium-sized enterprises] to replace the paper-based system that currently exists that is both opaque and inefficient. Greater transparency could lend itself to trading opportunities in the future.\u201d\nClark stressed that the development with IBM was initiated by the Italian subsidiary, adding, \u201cThis was a business-led initiative that came from Borsa Italiana \u2014 not built by LSE tech guys and then applied to a business-case, bottom-up approach.\u201d\nThe solution is undergoing an initial test phase with a small group of LSE partners and clients. So far, the move is being met with approval by blockchain and exchange specialists. \nPatrick Young, executive director of DV Advisors, an advisory company for exchanges, told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cThe LSE deploying blockchain [technology] for private company data management makes eminent sense. It\u2019s a simple first-level deployment as opposed to a radical shift involving retirement of legacy non-DL [distributed ledger] technology.\u201d\nThis blockchain solution, developed in collaboration with IBM, is built on highly secure infrastructure technology with the highest levels of encryption commercially available.\nThe LSE is not the first European exchange to announce the use of blockchain technology. This year there have been a number of European banks that have said they are using blockchain-based trade finance for SMEs. This includes the American International Group and Standard Chartered Bank.\nEddy Travia, CEO of Coinsilium, a firm that finances and manages the development of early-stage blockchain technology companies, said to Bitcoin Magazine: \u201cBlockchain technologies offer the potential for greater efficiencies and streamlined processes by reducing operational costs through automated transactions and smart contracts, thus removing costs usually associated with intermediaries.\u201d\nIBM is seeing blockchain technology as an important part of its security plans. The technology is built on Hyperledger Fabric version 1.0, a blockchain framework. The projects are hosted by the Linux Foundation, and the system will allow sensitive securities data to be shared with permissioned network participants while remaining secure and gated.\nTravia added: \u201cHyperledger is clearly targeting large corporate clients with their permissioned blockchain solution, but in the future it is likely that we will see the adoption of a range of blockchain propositions such as RSK, which offers a balanced solution between true decentralized public blockchains and federated nodes.\u201d\n\u201cSharing secure and transparent critical network data across shareholder networks is difficult using traditional system[s],\u201d said Marie Wieck, general manager of IBM Blockchain, in a statement. \u201cBlockchain [technology] is poised to help remove some of these barriers in traditional methods for the transfer of value \u2014 much as the internet did for the exchange of information in the late 1990s.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 26}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAirbitz is one of the more popular mobile bitcoin wallets among those who believe in the digital asset\u2019s core tenet of decentralization. Recently, Bitcoin Magazine caught up with Airbitz CEO Paul Puey to get his thoughts on preserving Bitcoin\u2019s decentralization in a smartphone environment.\n\u201cDecentralization has always been a key goal of our wallet, but of course balanced with usability,\u201d Puey told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWhile we present a login interface that mirrors a centralized, hosted solution, our wallet can still function even if Airbitz servers are 100% down. This is a unique proposition that is non-existent in the cryptocurrency or legacy technology space.\u201d\nRecently, Airbitz have added two features that point to the bitcoin wallet\u2019s commitment to a decentralized economy: LibertyX integration and the ability to point one\u2019s mobile wallet to a specific full node. Puey discussed these two features with Bitcoin Magazine, in addition to what Airbitz will be working on in the future.\nLibertyX Integration\nEarlier this year, a LibertyX plugin was added to the Airbitz wallet. This allows Airbitz users to find stores where they can buy bitcoin for cash from within their mobile wallet.\nLibertyX is a service that allows people to purchase bitcoin with cash from a local store. A map of participating stores is available on their website, and amounts of up to $1000 worth of bitcoin can be purchased at these locations per day.\nWhen purchasing $200 worth of bitcoin or less from LibertyX, a verified phone number is all that is needed to make a purchase. Amounts above $200 require further ID verification.\nLibertyX users are able to receive their bitcoin after giving a cashier cash and a code generated from the LibertyX app on their phone in some locations, while other stores require that the user enter a PIN code found on their receipt on the LibertyX app after making a cash payment.\nWhen asked if Airbitz may eventually roll out an integration with some form of P2P bitcoin exchange in a manner similar to Mycelium\u2019s Local Trader functionality, Puey responded, \u201dAt this point, we will continue to promote our integration with LibertyX. We believe they provide a great user experience and price for those looking to acquire bitcoin for cash, and it requires significantly less engineering to implement than a local trader type feature.\u201d\nPoint to Your Own Full Node\nAnother feature that was recently added to Airbitz is the ability to point the bitcoin wallet to a full node of a user\u2019s choice. Puey explained the importance of this feature to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cBitcoin democratizes access to financial services, but part of that democratization is choice \u2014 choice [as to] what services you use and support. The ability to choose your own node gives users the choice to connect to a node that implements the protocol they prefer, helping them put their vote on how they would like to define the future of Bitcoin.\u201d\nIf a bitcoin user is not operating their own full node, then they are trusting someone else to make sure the rules of the network are being properly followed. By allowing users to choose a specific full node, Airbitz is making sure their users can choose who they trust with the job of the enforcement of Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules. Of course, users can also point their Airbitz wallets to their own full nodes.\nThe ability to choose a full node is also important when it comes to hard forks, as those who are not operating their own full nodes do not get a say in potential changes to the protocol rules.\nWhat Else Is on the Way?\nFor now, Airbitz is mostly focused on their Edge Login SDK, which allows their Edge Security platform to be used for applications other than Bitcoin.\n\u201cYou'll see features and functionality really geared towards our Edge Login SDK and supporting our decentralized app partnerships like Augur and Wings,\u201d said Puey. \u201cWe aim to significantly grow the list of partners utilizing Edge Login, and you'll soon see new functionality that will help drive that effort.\u201d\nPuey added that Airbitz will continue to focus on the aspects of decentralization that they believe will extract the biggest value out of bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\n\u201cThe concepts of decentralized ownership of value, decentralized private key security, decentralized access to the blockchain, and even decentralized development of the core protocol have been well promoted and supported by Airbitz,\u201d said Puey.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 31}
{"title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: With August 1st Looming, Uncertainty is the Only Certainty", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/btc-price-analysis-august-1st-looming-uncertainty-only-certainty/", "birthday": "Jul 28, 2017 6:17 PM EST", "date": "2017-07-28 23:17:00", "content": "With only 3 days left before Bitcoin\u2019s hardfork is implemented, there is still great uncertainty among BTC-USD markets (which inherently applies to all cryptocurrencies) and what their imminent fate will be. One would expect, with so much market uncertainty, that BTC-USD should be seeing dropping prices as people begin to sell their BTC in lieu of other fiat and crypto-assets. However, in a surprising turn of events, BTC-USD has managed to climb by over $300 within the past 24 hours. Because the speculations regarding the BTC hardfork vary wildly, this market analysis will look at the raw data presented on the markets and will not attempt to account for any of the hardforking ramifications.\n\nWant to learn how to keep your bitcoins safe? Read this.\n\nThe figure below shows two indications that the BTC-USD climb is due for a consolidation period and possibly some pullback in price:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 2HR Candles, Bitfinex, Momentum Loss\nThe first that stands out with the current $300 rise is the decreasing volume throughout the length of this little bull run. Decreasing volume indicates the decrease in market interest in these higher values and typically leads to either a consolidation period or a pullback in price to garner support from lower values. \nThe second indicator that stands out is the 2HR MACD divergence shown in pink. Typically, for a healthy bull run to sustain its upward momentum, we would like to see the MACD making new highs on the histogram to accompany the new highs in market value. Looking closely, you can see the most recent high of approximately $2800 did not correspond to a new high on the MACD histogram. Thus, another indicator of market momentum loss reveals the increased likelihood of market price consolidation.\nAs always, it is important to put the current market trend within the context of the grand picture: \nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 6HR Candles, Bitfinex, Hidden Bearish Divergence\nLooking at the 6HR candles trend, there is a subtle hint of macro bearish divergence on the MACD. When the MACD signal line/moving average makes a new high, but the price trend does not make a new high, this can be an indication of bearish leaning momentum called \u201chidden bearish divergence.\u201d In addition to the MACD hidden bearish divergence, we can see a severely decreased volume trend as we approach the highs made a couple weeks ago. In general, the upper $2000s seem to be a battleground that is starting fizzle out in a bearish fashion. This could be attributed to many factors, but ultimately I think the wild price swings can be easily explained by the great uncertainty in the market surrounding the August 1st hardfork.\nWith only 3 days left, speculators are getting situated in their positions. Until the hardfork is implemented, there is no telling what will happen to the BTC-USD markets or the cryptomarket as a whole. So, with all this uncertainty in the air, where can we expect to find levels of support in the event of a major crash on August 1st? The figure below shows the key support levels to look for on the macro scale:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 12HR Candles, Bitfinex, Key Support Levels\nOnce again, the key support levels for the macro trend are found along the Fibonacci Retracement values of the entire bull run. Immediately below our current values lies very solid, historic support at $2500 values. A test of this support value will ultimately dictate the immediate future of the BTC-USD market. \nOn the run up to $2900 a couple weeks ago, a lot of volume went into the market to develop firm support. A breakdown of this support level could prove to be quite destructive to the BTC-USD market in the short term. The $2500 support level is clearly shown in the massive influx of volume and proves to be a severe point of market interest. To date, that is one of the strongest support levels BTC-USD has established, as indicated by the rise in volume around those prices.\nSummary:\nOn the macro and micro levels, BTC-USD is showing indications of price consolidation in the near future.Key support levels are found along the Fibonacci Retracement values. In particular, $2500 has proven its historical significance in the market and should be closely watched in the event of a bear run post-hardfork on August 1st.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

{"title": "Investing in Cryptocurrencies as Securities: An Interview from a Legal Perspective", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/investing-cryptocurrencies-securities-interview-legal-perspective/", "birthday": "Jul 28, 2017  4:08 PM EST", "date": "2017-07-28 21:08:00", "content": "Tanzeel Akhtar has held full-time positions in London working for FT Alphaville, Interactive Investor, Fund Strategy, Money Marketing, Mining Journal, Marketing Week and Futures and Options Intelligence.\nDigital currency practices have exploded in recent months, bringing to the forefront new regulations. This means VC investors looking to get a piece of the action need to do further due-diligence and remain informed on the legal side.\nAccording to Inside Bitcoins, last year two Bitcoin and blockchain-related startups raised over $1 billion in total investment. This is a massive increase from the $347 million invested in the space in 2014.\nSo what are the latest issues around cryptocurrencies? How will the recent SEC announcement impact investors? Bob Graham, partner and head of the digital currency services practice at Friedman LLP, has been receiving inquiries from both Bitcoin and blockchain-related firms and investor funds asking for audits and advice. \nGraham tells Bitcoin Magazine in an exclusive interview what VC investors should be aware of and how Bitfinex recently engaged Friedman to assist with an audit. \nWhat issues are VCs facing related to digital currency? \nThere are several issues that VCs are facing when making investment decisions. Comparability of financial information between companies and industry trends are important factors that many investors use. There are a lot of startups in the digital currency industry, but some entities are becoming more mature and sophisticated, which brings more sophisticated investors. \nWhich accounting rules apply?\nCurrently under U.S. GAAP [generally accepted accounting procedure] rules, there are no specific accounting principles to address digital currencies, and therefore companies must interpret existing standards to determine which standard best applies by analogy to the transactions they are accounting for. This can result in divergence in practice and incomparability of financial information for investors looking to make an investment decision.\nAnother issue that many investors are facing is the lack of regulation and clarity. On the regulatory side this week we saw the SEC announce it would regulate the DAO. What is your view? \nThe SEC released their \u201cReport of Investigation Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO,\u201d which provided some clarification, in that the Commission determined that DAO Tokens are securities under the Securities Act of 1933. I have discussed this conclusion with members of the digital currency community, and the general consensus was that it was anticipated that the SEC would include tokens as considered securities under the Securities Act of 1933. \nThe SEC concluded that whether or not a particular transaction involves the offer and sale of a security will depend on the facts and circumstances, including the economic realities of the transaction. This is important, as the SEC is evaluating tokens on a case-by-case basis using the fact pattern outlined in the Report of Investigation into the DAO. \nThey provided some key considerations that companies and their consultants can evaluate in determining if tokens being offered would be considered a security under Securities Act of 1933. \nThere has been a significant influx of capital into digital currency companies during 2017 through token offerings, which vary significantly in structure. Some of the members of the community fear that regulation may slow innovation, but there is a delicate balance [between] innovation and investor protection. Some more sophisticated investors, including VCs, have been hesitant to enter the token-offering environment due to the lack of regulation.\nWe hear the phrase \u201cWild West\u201d quite a lot when people refer to the cryptocurrency world. Could you expand on why you think a \u201cWild West\u201d type scenario is being created? \nOne could say that the lack of regulation, relatively short timeframes and significant amount of capital being raised through token offerings could create a \u201cWild West\u201d scenario when compared to a traditional route of an initial public offering. Companies looking to perform a token offering have to evaluate the structure of their offering and utilize lawyers and accounting firms that have experience in this industry in order to ensure they are appropriately protecting the investors, employees of the companies and the company itself.\nWith the SEC report discussed above, the SEC has put companies in this industry on notice that they are expected to follow the registration process with the Commission and take appropriate steps to comply with U.S. federal securities laws unless they are subject to exemption. It will be interesting to see how quickly the SEC proceeds in evaluating other token offerings that have been completed and any future token offerings; but they will be a key part of bringing regulation to the industry, which will hopefully improve investor confidence and allow digital currencies to become more mainstream investment vehicles. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCan you tell us more about the theft and compromised-exchanges issue facing the space? How could those types of issues have been avoided? Will the environment become safer? \nI think that the environment will become safer as the digital currency markets continue to mature \u2026 The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment imposing a $110 million fine on the Bitcoin exchange BTC-e for violating anti-money laundering laws. This is important as BTC-e is not domiciled in the U.S., and shows that U.S. regulators are willing to pursue action across borders. There is also an ongoing IRS investigation of the digital currency exchange Coinbase, which is domiciled in San Francisco, regarding tax reporting for digital currency transactions and customer records.\nAs exchanges continue to mature and subject themselves to additional checks and balances, whether through an audit of the financial information or an audit of their internal controls and processes, they will continue to develop better systems and processes which will hopefully promote a safer environment. These exchanges will continue to be the targets of theft due to the considerable value of their customer accounts and the digital nature of the transactions, but with continued development and more defined and tested processes the potential for loss will hopefully be reduced. \nKeep in mind that no matter how sound an environment there is, there will always be a possibility of theft or other targeted attacks, but that isn\u2019t something unique to the digital currency industry as it occurs often in other industries as well.\nWhat role has Friedman LLP played in helping Bitfinex following the recent theft of more than $65 million worth of bitcoins from its exchange?\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t go into a lot of detail about client accounts outside of what is public knowledge regarding the press release.

However, the simultaneously issued Investor Bulletin should also be closely read by issuers of ICOs and their counsel.\nAdvice for Issuers and Counsel\nEven though the bulletin was prepared as a cautionary statement to investors, it contains at least one disclaimer (in boldface type) that attorneys advising ICOs should add the following language to any offering document or white paper:\nInvesting in an ICO may limit your recovery in the event of fraud or theft. While you may have rights under the federal securities laws, your ability to recover may be significantly limited.\nWe have previously discussed the importance of these disclaimers and risk factors. By discussing the vulnerabilities of cryptocurrency exchanges and the potential difficulties associated with any recovery of invested or stolen funds, the SEC signals at least some of the risk factors counsel should consider adding to ICO offering materials. \u00a0\nIn fact, prudent attorneys advising their ICO clients would be wise to employ the cut-and-paste function, adding the above caveat to all their documents.\nThis additional wording is significant in that it spells out three key characteristics of ICOs:\n(i) the difficulty of tracing or securing virtual currency;\n(ii) the international scope of ICOs; and \n(iii) the fact that lack of any central authority may limit an investor\u2019s remedies against an issuer.\nPractical Advice for Investors\nBesides the usual bromides about being wary of any offer that sounds \u201ctoo good to be true,\u201d the SEC demonstrated an appreciation for the unique due diligence required in carefully evaluating an ICO.\nAccording to the bulletin, investors should \u201cask whether the blockchain is open and public, whether the code has been published, and whether there has been an independent cybersecurity audit.\u201d The SEC is communicating that those factors are indicative of companies whose products are verifiably real and secure.\nGiven the importance the SEC placed on these three items, rather than await questions, such points should be clearly addressed by an issuer in its ICO materials distributed to potential investors. Issuers of ICOs should include those factors and other \u201cgood facts\u201d that can help to demonstrate their product\u2019s value, security and legitimacy.\nWhile the recent flurry of documents emanating from the SEC likely has given issuers of ICOs and their counsel pause (and caused them to walk each token through the Howey test), it does not appear to have stifled these transactions.\nHowever, where the report reiterates the conceptual framework under which any potential token offering be evaluated to determine whether it constitutes a securities offering, the bulletin provides practical advice, and investors should expect to see some of the SEC\u2019s language repeated in ICO offering documents going forward.\nThis is a guest post by Gray Sasser and Joshua Rosenblatt.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIf all goes according to plan, August 1st will see the launch of a new cryptocurrency, described as an \u201cairdrop altcoin,\u201d a \u201cspinoff-coin,\u201d a \u201cfork-coin,\u201d a \u201cclone-coin,\u201d or \u2014 as the people behind the project call it \u2014 \u201ca new version of Bitcoin:\u201d Bitcoin Cash (\u201cBCC\u201d). Anyone who holds bitcoin (BTC) on this day, at 12:20 UTC precisely, will automatically receive the equivalent amount in BCC, attributed to their Bitcoin private keys.\nBitcoin Cash is the realization of the \u201cUser Activated Hard Fork\u201d (UAHF) that was first announced as Bitmain\u2019s contingency plan in case of a chain-split caused by the BIP148 user activated soft fork (UASF) \u2014 although the mining hardware producer has sent out mixed signals about the project since. \nA first software implementation of the Bitcoin Cash protocol, called Bitcoin ABC, was recently revealed by its lead developer, Amaury \u201cDeadal Nix\u201d Sech\u00e9t at the Future of Bitcoin conference in Arnhem, the Netherlands. Sech\u00e9t worked at Facebook for the past years and decided to focus on Bitcoin full time earlier this year.\nBitcoin Magazine spoke with Sech\u00e9t about his vision for Bitcoin Cash.\n\nAnyone in favor of increasing the block size could have forked off for years now. What took you so long?\nWell, I wasn't expecting the whole situation to last this long. Bitcoin Classic seemed to get a lot of traction last year, and then the Hong Kong Roundtable Consensus happened, so it seemed like things were working well enough for a while\u2026\nThis year I started to do research on a scaling solution for Bitcoin myself, at first focusing on extension blocks. Bitcoin ABC was initially a base I could use to build various experiments on top of. I was later contacted by \u201cFreetrader,\" a developer on the r/btcfork subreddit, who wanted to implement an adjustable block size limit on top of Bitcoin ABC.\nThen the whole UAHF plan was proposed by Bitmain. Freetrader and I both thought it was a good idea, so we implemented it.\nWhat is your relationship with Bitmain? Are they funding you in any way?\nI got a sponsorship from the Bitcoin Development Grant to do my scaling research. This was mostly thanks to other\u00a0research I\u2019d done prior. I\u2019m not funded to work on Bitcoin ABC specifically. That was not the original plan; but sometimes you can't predict where things are going to lead.\nThe BIP148 UASF seems to have been made obsolete by BIP91. Why is this \u201cUAHF\u201d still happening?\nThat BIP148 was made obsolete only became clear very recently. Uncertainty remained even after SegWit2x [the scaling proposal based on the New York Agreement, and backed by a number of Bitcoin companies and mining pools] was released. Depending on how fast miners would adopt it, the UASF could happen or not. So we continued to push forward with the UAHF. \nBy the time it was known that the UASF wouldn't happen, it was also very clear that there was strong market demand for the UAHF anyways.\nWhat made that clear to you?\nA lot of people contacted us and wanted to launch Bitcoin Cash.\n\u201cRandom\u201d people? Or also companies, miners or perhaps well-known individuals in the space?\nAll of the above. But I do not wish to mention anyone specifically. Some, like ViaBTC and OKCoin have gone public. If others want to do that too, they'll have to do it themselves.\nMore to the point, then: Bitcoin Cash will remove Segregated Witness (SegWit) and will have a default block size limit of 8 megabytes. Why eight, not two or seven or unlimited?\nThere is a judgment call there. Eight megabytes is large enough to make sure we have a mechanism to adjust it by the time we get anywhere close to the limit. On the other hand, you don't want to go unlimited cowboy style. As the size of blocks grow, there is a lot of work to be done to ensure they keep being processed efficiently.\nWhat if 8 megabyte blocks fill up very fast? It seems evident that the Bitcoin network endured a lot of spam over the past year, for example, that could happen again...\nIt could, and increasing the block size to 8 megabytes is not a perfect solution in this sense, but it's an improvement. At least at 8 megabytes it\u2019d be more expensive to keep the attack going.\nIt would be even more expensive to spam blocks full at 16 megabytes. Yet, you won\u2019t increase the blocks to 16 megabytes when the 8 megabyte limit is hit quickly?\nI think most people are going to use the default settings at first, so that\u2019s 8 megabytes. After this fork is behind us, we'll make sure to deploy some mechanism to handle the block size so we don't need to play central planners.\nWhat kind of mechanism will that be?\nPerhaps BIP100, or one of the other many proposals that have been made.\nBIP100 hands control over the block size to miners, which is also controversial. Do you think it will be hard to get everyone to agree on a solution?\nI think that people will come to an agreement. The reason there is a split now, is because people have different ideas of where they want Bitcoin to go. Once blocks on Bitcoin Cash fill up, people will still want to go to the same place, so I'm confident they'll stay in the same boat.\nWhere do you see Bitcoin Cash in relation to SegWit2x?\nWhen I got into this, my idea was that either SegWit2x will fail and we'd get a UASF chain and a UAHF chain. Or SegWit2x would succeed and we\u2019d get neither the UASF or the UAHF. But as mentioned, a lot of people will value the UAHF even with SegWit2x. I don't want to speak for everybody, but concerns about SegWit2x range from the 2x part not being acted upon, some feature of Segregated Witness hurting long-term scalability or simply thinking that the conflict is just delayed and will restart later on.\nI do hope we can have a friendly relation with the SegWit2x team. Whoever is better wins in the end.\nSo that brings me back to my previous question. Those in favor of a block size limit increase hard fork are rallying behind different proposals. And that\u2019s not even taking into account Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s \u201cEmergent Consensus\u201d and other ideas. If you can\u2019t agree on a single way forward now, what makes you think you can when blocks fill up?\nI see all these different proposals as the symptom of a fast moving environment. When I started Bitcoin ABC with Freetrader, SegWit2x and the UAHF did not even exist yet.\nBesides, I could say the same for the other side. There was the Hong Kong Roundtable, then SegWit-only, then the UASF, and now SegWit2x which is kind of a compromise between the two sides.\nBitcoin Core has a pretty clear and consistent policy: no contentious hard forks. Without such a policy, don\u2019t you see a cryptocurrency splitting into factions for each disagreement?\nThat's possible. But Ethereum did a contentious hard fork once as well and did not split any further after that. There is a strong incentive to stick together: People will split only if there is a strong difference of vision.\nYou\u2019re not the first to have a \u201cdifference of vision\u201d for Bitcoin\u2019s direction. Litecoin was created to offer a better payment experience. Dogecoin was, likewise, lauded for its micropayment potential. Why not just use an altcoin, instead of forking away from Bitcoin?\nLitecoin developers seem to mostly have the same vision as Bitcoin Core developers, so I don't think that\u2019s a good substitute. Dogecoin has infinite inflation, which doesn\u2019t make for a sound money. I could go on for each altcoin, but that'd be a very long list.\nLet me slightly re-phrase the question, then: Why not create a new altcoin from scratch, specifically designed for the purpose you have in mind?\nMost altcoins try to do something more than Bitcoin, which is fine. But we aren\u2019t. Bitcoin decided to take a road with Segregated Witness and off-chain solutions. We are trying to continue to do what Bitcoin has been doing for some time.\nI also ask this because the name \u201cBitcoin Cash\u201d could be confusing for people, to the point where some consider it misleading or even fraudulent\u2026\nI did not come up with that name, but I like it. People will complain no matter what. This project wants to continue Bitcoin and grow it to become a peer-to-peer electronic cash used worldwide. Adding \u201cCash\u201d seemed like a good way to differentiate and also convey the vision.\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, \u201ccash\u201d means either \u201cready money\u201d or \u201cmoney or its equivalent (such as a check) paid for goods or services at the time of purchase or delivery.\u201d How does that not apply to Bitcoin itself?\nThe second definition in particular doesn't quite work with high fees. If I buy something for $5 and I pay a fee of 50 cents, that's a big deal. Too much friction.\n\u201cLow fees\u201d or \u201clow friction\u201d is not part of either definition.\nBut I want bitcoin to be a widely used electronic cash. A cryptocurrency that is used for day-to-day inexpensive stuff, as well as expensive purchases.\nBecause of the risks presented by bigger blocks, Bitcoin Core developers generally prefer to offload the day-to-day inexpensive stuff to layers built on top of the blockchain. Does Bitcoin Cash have no plans to adopt SegWit, or the Lightning Network, or other second-layer technologies at all?\nI\u2019m not against Layer 2 technologies themselves, they can add value. I\u2019m just against not growing the base layer. \nBitcoin Cash will probably not see SegWit in its current shape, not as a soft fork. But fixing malleability and enabling Layer 2 solutions will happen. Technology to enable building blocks over time, such as weak blocks, is also important to improve 0-confirmation security and scale to bigger blocks.\nAnother reason some rallied behind SegWit is that it would block covert use of the patented AsicBoost mining technology. Do you have any plans to block AsicBoost?\nI crunched the numbers for the potential benefit that miners can get from AsicBoost, and I think SegWit doesn\u2019t change that much. It\u2019s a lot of noise for nothing. I don\u2019t really plan to spend much time to either help or hinder it. There are more interesting and important things to do.\nWho\u2019s going to be developing Bitcoin ABC, or the Layer 2 solutions you mention? Because, let\u2019s be honest, you don\u2019t have much support from Bitcoin\u2019s development community so far.\nWe do not plan to develop Layer 2 technologies; we plan to enable them. We ourselves will focus on the protocol itself, so on malleability and weak blocks. We have enough people to make it happen.\nWho, exactly?\nApart from myself and Freetrader, Bitprim has been helping. That is a company that's building infrastructure for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Unlimited developers Andrea \u201cSickpig\u201d Suisani and Antony Zegers have been helping out with Bitcoin Cash as well. And like other open-source projects, we have a kernel of people that contribute on a regular basis and even more that add a patch or two or help us with a specific problem.\nThe Bitcoin Unlimited developers in particular don't exactly have a pristine track record, with network-wide node crashes caused by bugs. Will this be any better for Bitcoin Cash?\nWe have a very different way of doing development than both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited, mostly derived from my work at Facebook as well as LLVM where I worked prior. We focus on doing many small incremental changes rather than fewer, bigger changes. This makes code review easier.\nSurely Bitcoin Core has a lot more review happening though, simply because they have more developers?\nCore has a lot of developers, but also a process that is slow. Slow processes generally tend to have fewer errors, but also make errors more costly because the slow processes also apply to fixing errors. There is a sweet spot between those two. I think we strike a good balance with Bitcoin ABC.\nLet\u2019s assume you are right about being being capable of maintaining a multi-billion dollar project \u2014 but wrong about it ever becoming a multi-billion dollar project. What if users don\u2019t choose Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin? Are you committed to Bitcoin Cash even as a smaller coin?\n\u201cWhat if I\u2019m wrong?\u201d That's a question I'm asking myself all the time. In fact, this is the very reason I think it is misguided to bake economic constants, such as the 1 megabyte limit or the weight system, into the protocol. Not only do I know I may be wrong, but I'm also convinced that most people don't know any better than I do. Figuring out what the market wants is a fool's errand. You got to try to do what you think is best and adapt as the situation changes.\nI think it is pretty much inevitable that BCC starts as a minority coin. But longer term, it will either overtake Bitcoin or it will create an incentive for Bitcoin to scale. In either case, that'd be a win.\nYet, I may be wrong. Maybe the value of BCC will quickly drop to zero or close to zero. But unless it does, I will continue to work on Bitcoin Cash.\nDisclosure: Aaron van Wirdum, the author of this article, holds BTC and will therefore also own BCC on August 1st.\nAugust 1st - 6:22 pm UTC Update:\u00a0\nNo Bitcoin Cash blocks have yet been mined. If six consecutive Bitcoin Cash blocks take more than twelve hours to be mined, difficulty for the block after that is decreased by 20 percent.\u00a0Sech\u00e9t\u00a0remains hopeful that the chain will get rolling eventually.\n\"So far, it looks like the blocks are going to be slow the first week until difficulty readjusts, then it should be good,\" he told Bitcoin Magazine.\n", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 27}

In their talk, Blockstack co-founders Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea discussed how recent moves toward cloud computing and storage take away the data privacy and security guarantees long afforded by personal computing. In response to this problem, Blockstack and other decentralized applications built on top of various blockchains aim to give consumers the ability to control, manage and streamline their own digital lives.\nElizabeth Stark, co-founder and CEO of Lightning Network, then discussed recent technical developments that allow for both higher transaction volumes through specialized off-chain payment channels and transactions between two different types of cryptocurrencies. These developments are saving both parties transaction fees in the long run and helping alleviate some of the scaling issues that bitcoin and other currencies have been facing in recent years. \n\nLearn more about Lightning Networks in our three-part series, Understanding the Lightning Network.\n\nBram Cohen, BitTorrent creator, took the stage later with Blockstack\u2019s Ali to discuss developments in the space. When asked about the scaling debate and recent implementation of SegWit, Cohen drew chuckles from the crowd with an adamant declaration that \u201cSegWit solved a bug that should have been solved when Bitcoin was created.\u201d \nCohen also endorsed Bitcoin Core and shared his doubts regarding the technical competency of the teams behind some of the more recent ICOs of ERC20 tokens built on top of the Ethereum blockchain: \"As a general rule, if you don't have the skills to build your own token from scratch, you shouldn't run an ICO.\u201d\nNick Szabo, computer scientist and legal scholar, then discussed the origins of contract law, the historical implementation of smart contracts and the next steps the industry needs to take to implement smart contracts in a variety of commercial transactions, both between consumers and companies and between companies themselves.\nDrawing on his studies at George Washington University Law School, Szabo advocated for the integration of smart contracts into traditional contract and property law frameworks. Instead of attempting to rebuild legal theory from scratch, developers should work with existing frameworks that have already been debugged for centuries. \nSzabo explained a dichotomy of contract law: \u201cdry code,\u201d where an entire agreement can be interpreted and executed by computers based on a number of digital inputs; and \u201cwet code,\u201d or traditional law, where the agreements are interpreted by individual parties based on their own definitions of words and phrasing.\n\n\nVending Machines were the original smart contracts pic.twitter.com/PS14bFdmL8\u2014 AngelList (@AngelList) July 27, 2017\n\n\n\nMany industries exist today to help quantify and define examples of \u201cwet code\u201d in the world. Insurance claim adjusters analyze accident reports and eyewitness testimony in order to correctly pay out claims based on fault and the monetary value of the actual damages suffered by each party, for example.\nTranslating poorly organized data from real-world situations into a series of executable actions based on the terms of an agreement is a valuable service. Rather than call for an abolishment of these systems, Szabo argued that the future of decentralized smart contracts will exist in tandem with the best parts of more traditional finance industries in the coming future. Over the coming years, larger portions of traditional data analysis will become obsolete, performed digitally by more powerful and intelligent computers.\nThis is not the first time Szabo has spoken on the subject: As early as 2008, Szabo broke down the differences between wet and dry code on his blog, Unenumerated.\nNext, Balaji Srinivasan, founder of 21.co and a16z Board Partner, introduced the Nakamoto coefficient, a metric inspired by the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient to quantify the relative decentralization of different types of cryptocurrencies. By looking at the distribution of power in six subsects of individual cryptocurrencies, Srinivasan was able to compare the relative strengths of different blockchains and networks against attacks that require a majority or supermajority of the power in a system to be compromised.\nSrinivasan started by organizing the six essential subsystems of both Bitcoin and Ethereum:\nmining, where power is equal to who receives mining rewards;clients, where power is equal to the number of users;developers, where power is relatively equal to the number of commits;exchanges, where power is equal to trading volume;nodes, where power is measured by the distribution of nodes around the world; andcoin ownership, where power is measured by how much coin each wallet address contains.\nAfter calculating the amount of power owned by each entity in the six subsystems, Srinivasan was able to calculate a Gini coefficient (dubbed the \u201cNakamoto coefficient\u201d) based on the relative power concentrations for each subsystem. For instance, if every miner has the same amount of hashpower and receives the same reward, the subsystem would receive a value of 0. If a single miner receives all of the rewards, then the subsystem would receive a value of 1.\nSrinivasan\u2019s Nakamoto coefficient calculations for Bitcoin and Ethereum\nDespite a myriad of differences, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have nearly identical Nakamoto coefficients of \u22480.91, indicating that at least one subsystem in each ecosystem is highly centralized. However, based on Srinivasan\u2019s calculations, it\u2019s clear that Bitcoin is either slightly (client, exchanges, nodes and owners) or drastically (mining and developers) more decentralized than Ethereum. Most surprisingly, Bitcoin\u2019s mining network is far more decentralized than Ethereum\u2019s (0.4 vs. 0.82).\nThis is the first time Srinivasan has discussed a metric for decentralization of cryptocurrency markets. He has since published his findings, with links to the underlying datasets, on his company\u2019s blog.\nAfter a panel discussing specific use cases for cryptocurrency payments, Wealth and Poverty author George Gilder led a rousing endorsement of a tokenized, decentralized web and its ability to destroy \u201csilos\u201d of the internet created both by countries and companies alike. \nCiting the vast amounts of data companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon save and measure about their users\u2019 digital lives, Gilder spoke of a future where individuals can explicitly control the flow of their data, secured by decentralized protocols and powered by tokens.\n\nIt was fitting that Blockstack Summit was held in the Computer History Museum, an ode to the stories and artifacts of the information age and its impact on society. With fully restored IBM mainframes, an Apple I and the source codes of dozens of impactful softwares like MS-DOS, Photoshop and Word, the museum served as a backdrop for discussions that look to an open, free and uncensored society of the future.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 31}

Before splitting off with its hardfork counterpart (Bitcoin Cash), BTC-USD saw drastic swings in price with wildly different market values, depending on the exchange. While some exchanges saw new all-time highs being achieved (Kraken BTC-USD), others began to see discounts in their BTC-USD values. At points, there were even $100+ premiums between Kraken and Bitfinex.\nAt time of this article, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) markets on most major exchanges have existed in a bubble as BCH deposits and withdrawals have been halted. There are many theories regarding the isolation of exchanges and their corresponding BCH-USD markets\u2019 effects on the BTC-USD markets. Given this bit of information, one can assume that the dramatic rise in BCH market cap is unreliable at the moment. There is a large portion of the Bitcoin community that is unable to sell its forked BCH and is currently sidelined. As such, this analysis will only take a look at BTC-USD price trend and what we can expect there.\n\nWant to learn how to claim your BCH? Find out here.\n\nLooking at the macro trend of the BTC-USD market, we can see that a previous test of the 23% Fibonacci Retracement values was strongly tested and subsequently rejected in the days leading up to the hardfork:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 12HR Candles, Bitfinex, Macro Fibonacci Retracement Lines\nThe $2500 values have proven to be a formidable foe for those looking to the short the market, and last week was no exception. To date, $2500 values have built a strong level of support over the past couple months and will continue to be a strongly contested price range. \nThe activity following the hardfork was completely expected by many. Without going into too much detail, the hardfork of BTC-USD can be thought of as a fracturing of its market cap \u2014 essentially, an instant reduction of BTC-USD value:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 15Min Candles, Bitfinex, Price Drop Post-hardfork\nAt the moment, since BCH-USD has yet to be opened to those without coins on the major exchanges, the actual effects of the hardfork have yet to be felt (as mentioned before, the bulk of the BCH holders are currently sidelined without major outlets to sell their coins). The current prices are reflective of speculators anticipating a drop in value upon the opening of the BCH deposits and withdrawals. To date, the price activity has followed the Fibonacci Retracement values very closely. Multiple tests of the 50% retracement values were attempted before ultimately dropping down to the lower values. At the time of this article, the BTC-USD markets are attempting to test the 23% Fibonacci Retracement values.\nGiven the fact that BCH has yet to really sink its fingers into the BTC-USD markets, one would expect to see a test of new lows within this current bear run. With each test of the Fibonacci lines there is a swell in volume. A test of the lower boundaries of the bear run will be no exception. \nIt\u2019s never easy to confidently write price projections with so much uncertainty in the markets. In an attempt to remain objective in my writing, I will just say this: Volatility is to be expected as BCH and BTC attempt to set their place in the market. \nIn general, when looking for reliable trends, it is almost always advisable to watch the volume trend as it correlates to price movement. When the price is erratic and appears to operating irrationally, check the volume. If there is no volume to substantiate a move, more often than not the move will be short lived. Volume establishes support and it reaffirms resistance lines. Volume also is a great indicator of market momentum and direction. When trading BTC in the coming days, volume will be your best friend.\nSummary:\n\nBTC-USD showed strong support at the $2500 values in the days leading up to the hardfork.To date, the effects of the hardfork have yet to be realized because BCH deposits and withdrawals from most major exchanges haven\u2019t be enabled.Once BCH deposits are enabled, expect high volatility on the BTC-USD markets as both coins (BTC and BCH) compete for their market cap share.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The trip from farm or factory to store shelves involves numerous opportunities to falsify shipping documents and alter shipping container records or contents with little accountability.\n\"Global supply chain management has drastically changed in the last 10-15 years,\" William Nieusma, Vice President, Government Strategy at Bloq told Bitcoin Magazine: \"Regulatory mandates, operational complexity and data security concerns have ramped up the pressure to overhaul these outdated systems.\u201d\nNieusma is one of the authors of Bloq\u2019s recently released white paper, \u201cAccelerating Global Trade Processes with Blockchain,\u201d designed to introduce their new project to develop a model blockchain network for companies involved in trade.\n\u201cBut it's not all doom-and-gloom; adopters of blockchain-based systems can cut costs, improve customer service and find new, verified business partners,\" added Nieusma.\nAlan Cohn, attorney and consultant and advisor to Bloq told us:\n\"Global trade is an area where blockchain can play a transformative role, not just for industry but also for government.\"\nNieusma noted that Bloq believes that in the future, the most significant and valuable business systems, including trade, will run on blockchains.\nIBM has recognized the potential of blockchain and trade. In partnership with seven European banks, it is building a pilot blockchain trade program with Hyperledger to enable companies like Walmart and Maersk to use blockchain technology to better track the movement of farm and factory products to the store shelves.\nMicrosoft is also building a model trade program using the Ethereum blockchain in a pilot project with JPMorgan.\nBlockchain Tech and Trade Are a Perfect Fit\nTrade finance and supply management lend themselves well to the particular advantages of blockchain technology. The Bloq white paper states:\nBlockchain technology holds considerable promise to substantially improve supply chain security and transparency. Blockchain\u2019s inherent architectural attributes solve several weaknesses in current trade IT systems and processes to ensure information immutability and transaction auditing, thereby increasing trade value capture and value creation.\nBloq\u2019s model trade platform promises companies high levels of cybersecurity, reduced waiting times, transparency, ease of revenue payments, low infrastructure investment, easily auditable transactions, efficient accommodation for additional participants, immutability and automatic bonding and payments through smart contracts.\nBloq plans to build a \u201cpermissioned, federated network\u201d built on the Bitcoin blockchain that, depending on the client\u2019s needs, will also support Ethereum and Hyperledger. Nieusma said:\n\u201cBloq believes that the future is a multi-chain, multi-network world and that interoperability is a guiding principle in network buildout.\u201d \nThe Bloq program will connect all parties involved in a trade including buyers, banks, sellers and transporters so that information about a shipment is distributed among all involved parties at the same time.\nAs the white paper states:\n\u201cTrade can be safer, more secure, and more profitable with less human error. We hope this discussion leads to an evolution in trade that benefits all stakeholders.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 31}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nPlease note: Everything in this article is just advice, based on our best understanding of the current situation. Everything is still very uncertain and subject to change: Be extremely careful!\nBitcoin Cash (sometimes referred to as Bcash, and mostly using the tickers BCH or BCC) launched today. Anyone who held bitcoin at 12:20 p.m. UTC should have an equivalent amount of BCH attributed to their Bitcoin private keys.\nIn our beginner\u2019s guide to surviving the BIP 148 split, which was subsequently updated to also cover the Bitcoin Cash launch, we explained how to secure your private keys so you could be sure to access your BCH. At the time of writing that article, much was still uncertain about how this event would play out.\nMuch is still uncertain, but to the extent that the situation can be understood at present, this article explains how you can claim \u2014 and potentially use \u2014 your BCH.\nAuthor\u2019s note: If you want to play the BTC/BCH markets as soon as possible, and you are fine with taking risks and/or you really know what you are doing, this article is probably not for you \u2014 it\u2019s a beginner\u2019s guide.\nLast updated: August 21\nTake Your Time\nThe good news is that, if everything went according to plan, Bitcoin Cash enforces strong replay protection. This means you shouldn't be able to accidentally spend your BTC when you mean to spend BCH, or vice versa.\nAs such, if you don\u2019t care about BCH at all right now, you don\u2019t need to do a thing. You can just keep using bitcoin as you always have. If you ever change your mind (and don\u2019t lose your Bitcoin private keys in the meantime), you can still claim your BCH at any point in the future.\nLikewise, if you want to hold on to your BCH long-term, you also don\u2019t need to do anything right now. You can keep using BTC as if nothing happened; just make sure to never lose your private keys.\n(Though in both these cases, it could come in handy to keep some records of the Bitcoin addresses that stored your bitcoins at time of the split. This is not strictly necessary, but your future self may thank you if you do it regardless. You should be able to find this information in your wallet of choice, though it differs a bit per wallet.)\nNow let\u2019s assume you do care about BCH right now, at least enough to want to sell your share.\nIf you followed the advice outlined in our beginner\u2019s guide, the good news is that you should be in full control of your Bitcoin private keys. This means you now hold BTC as well as BCH.\nThe bad news is that it\u2019s not necessarily easy or safe to claim your BCH straight away. If you are not careful, you may accidentally expose your private keys while claiming your BCH. And because these are the same private keys that secure your BTC, this could lead to your BTC being stolen. Needless to say, you want to avoid this! You almost certainly stand to lose much more from losing your BTC than you stand to gain from, say, selling your BCH fast.\nTherefore, you are going to want to take your time and make sure you understand what you are doing well enough to do it without exposing your private keys. Your BCH isn\u2019t going anywhere. And in part because the situation is still developing, even this article may contain accidental errors \u2026\nAccess Your Coins\nIn our previous beginner\u2019s guide, we explained how to secure your private keys and recommended different wallet options. Here, you can find, per option, how to access your BCH.\nFull Node Wallet\nOur first recommendation was to use a full node wallet, like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots. These wallets store your private keys in a dedicated folder on your computer. You can make a backup of this folder using the menu in your wallet, and select: \"Backup wallet\". Once you\u2019ve done this, you should be able to import this backup into a Bitcoin Cash full node, like Bitcoin ABC.\nHowever, to be on the safe side at this point in time, we are not fully comfortable recommending any Bitcoin Cash software. It is all very new, developed within a short timeframe, and the peer review done on all this software has probably not been as extensive as it usually is within the Bitcoin space. It is therefore probably wise to not import your private keys in such software right away; instead, wait to see if there are any reports of problems.\nUpdate, August 8: We have not yet received or seen any reports of problems.\nFurthermore, some Bitcoin Cash full node wallet software, like Bitcoin ABC, conflict with Bitcoin software, such as Bitcoin Core. It is therefore not recommended to install a Bitcoin Cash full node wallet on the same computer. Instead, it\u2019s best to install it on a completely different computer. It is on this computer that you can import your wallet backup and have access to your BCH.\nIf you are not exactly a beginner, there is one alternative option. NBitcoin developer Nicolas Dorier created a splitting tool, which allows you to split your BTC from your BCH. However, this tool requires you to work in the command line of your operating system; if you know how to do this, you probably don\u2019t need this article.\nUpdate, August 21: Coinomi published a blog post explaining how to access your BCH using their wallet. This includes instructions for full node wallets.\nPaper Wallet\nOur second recommendation was to use a paper wallet. This advice was given in the context of storing your coins long-term in particular. But if you want to access your BCH, of course you can do this right away.\nUnfortunately, however, not many wallets actually support directly importing your private key(s) \u2014 and less so for BCH. One wallet that does allow for this option in Bitcoin is Electrum. Therefore, the BCH version of Electrum, dubbed \u201cElectron Cash,\u201d should allow you to do this, too.\nHowever, Electrum itself has issued an official warning concerning Electron Cash. Electron Cash is not properly vetted and therefore not guaranteed to work as advertised. This is a big risk, and we recommend against using it for now. (This may change in the future.)\nUpdate, August 8: We have not yet received or seen any reports of problems.\nThat said, if you do choose to opt for this solution (at your own risk!), make sure to at least take two additional precautions. First, run the software on a different computer as the computer you run Electrum on, if you run Electrum. (In fact, it\u2019s probably best to use it on a different computer than the one where you hold any bitcoins or any other sensitive data, for that matter.) \nAdditionally, first move the BTC from your paper wallet to a new Bitcoin address (like a new paper wallet) before you do anything with BCH! That way, even if the Electron Cash wallet manages to steal your private keys, or the computer you use is insecure, the damage should be limited: these Bitcoin private keys won\u2019t hold any BTC anymore. (Make sure not to send BTC to this same paper wallet later on either, though.)\nUpdate, August 21: Coinomi published a\u00a0blog post\u00a0explaining how to access your BCH using their wallet. This includes instructions for paper wallets.\nHardware Wallet\nOur third recommendation was to use a hardware wallet, as listed on bitcoin.org. Two of these hardware wallets in particular, Trezor and Ledger, have gone through the effort of offering you access to your BCH. So if you have one of these wallets, you\u2019re in luck: this is probably the safest and easiest way to access your BCH.\nLedger has published a blog post explaining how to access your BCH, which you can find here. \nTrezor has also published a blog post on how to claim your BCH, which you can find here. Update: Trezor has removed BCH for now, due to a bug in their Bitcoin Cash backend server. Don't worry, your funds are secure. Update: This issue is now fixed.\nThe third hardware wallet, Digital Bitbox, has published an FAQ on how to access your BCH. However, note that this wallet recommends using Electron Cash, which is not guaranteed to be secure. See the above section on paper wallets for more details.\nThe last hardware wallet, KeepKey, has also published a blog post on Bitcoin Cash. At the time of writing, it seems you won\u2019t be able to access your BCH quite yet; keep an eye on their blog for updates.\nOther Bitcoin.org Wallets\nIf you didn\u2019t take these three recommendations, perhaps you used one of the other wallets listed on bitcoin.org.\nOnce again, whichever of these wallets you used, your BCH should be safe and there\u2019s no rush to claim them. But actually being able to claim them may differ a bit from wallet to wallet. \nMost wallets use a recovery seed. This phrase essentially holds your BTC private keys, and therefore also your BCH private keys. As such, you should be able to access your BCH by inserting this seed into a dedicated BCH wallet.\nHowever, at this point in time there are no BCH wallets available yet that allow this and which we can confidently recommend using. If BCH becomes somewhat of a success over time, this will probably change. It\u2019s probably best to just wait until this is the case. (If it ever becomes the case.)\nUntil then, you can just keep using BTC without worrying about your BCH.\nUpdate, August 3: Various wallets have issued statement on BCH, and how you can claim your funds. See this Reddit post\u00a0post for a series of links.\nUpdate, August 7: Coinomi\u00a0has integrated BCH into their wallet, and uses a private key seed compatible with several of the wallets listed on bitcoin.org. And if you were using the BTC.com wallet, you should also have access to your BCH.\nUpdate, August 21: Both Coinomi and BTC.com have published blog posts explaining how to access your BCH through these wallets, even if you were using different wallets on August 1st.\nOther (Non-bitcoin.org) Wallets, Exchanges, etc.\nIf you did not follow our advice, and instead stored your BTC in any other wallet, or on an exchange, or anywhere else, you may or may not still be able to claim your BCH. In this case, you\u2019ll have to figure out for yourself whether this is the case or not, and how to do so.\nUpdate, August 3: Various wallets have issued statement on BCH, and how you can claim your funds. See\u00a0this Reddit post\u00a0post for a series of links.\nUpdate, August 21: Both\u00a0Coinomi\u00a0and\u00a0BTC.com\u00a0have published blog posts explaining how to access your BCH through these wallets, even if you were using different wallets on August 1st.\nUsing (or Selling) Your BCH\nOnce you have claimed your BCH, you can use it however you please. Just like any other (alt)coin, you could for example sell it for BTC, or perhaps spend it somewhere, or move it to another wallet, etcetera.\nUpdate, August 3: Not many exchanges currently enable BCH deposits. At time of writing,\u00a0HitBTC and ViaBTC\u00a0do allow this, but we are not comfortable recommending either of these services for now. There is no guarantee you will actually receive BTC after you've sold your BCH on these platforms, and possibly little repercussion if you don't. It's probably best to wait until a more established exchange enables BCH deposits, and use this instead.\nUpdate, August 7: More exchanges are opening up BCH trade and deposits, including (but not limited to) Bitfinex, Kraken, Changelly and Shapeshift.\nUpdate, August 8: Be careful to only send BCH to specific BCH-addresses, and BTC to specific BTC-addresses. While they look (and technically are) the same, the two networks are fundamentally incompatible.\nFurther, there are three more factors to keep in mind before doing so.\nThe first factor is privacy. Your addresses are identical for BTC and BCH. This means that whenever you spend your BCH (for example, to send them to an exchange), you do not only reveal your BCH addresses but also your BTC addresses. This can in turn reveal a lot about your current holdings as well as your past and future transactions, and can by extension even reveal such data about people or entities you transact with. Make sure you are comfortable with giving up this data if you are going to send your BCH to an exchange or anywhere else. (There may be more privacy-friendly options to trade your BCH available in the near future, but these aren\u2019t ready yet.)\nThe second factor is mostly theoretical at this point, but worth mentioning nonetheless: \u00a0security. When you spend from a BCH address, you do not reveal your private key, but you do reveal your public key (which is not the same as your Bitcoin address). This strips away one layer of cryptographic security, even for your BTC addresses. It shouldn\u2019t mean (and hopefully doesn\u2019t mean) that your BTC are insecure right now, but there is an increased chance that your BTC aren\u2019t secure at some point in the (far) future when this particular cryptographic standard is weakened. It is therefore best to move your BTC to a new address.\nThe third factor was already mentioned but bears repeating: if you\u2019re using insecure software to claim your BCH, your BTC may be at risk. This is why it\u2019s probably best to move your BTC to a new address or even a whole new wallet with a new wallet seed\u00a0before you start meddling with BCH. That way, if you do mess up with insecure BCH software, you shouldn't lose your BTC.\n(Additionally, if you move your BTC to one of your own addresses before touching BCH, you reduce the risk of replay attacks \u2014 but as mentioned, if all goes well this shouldn\u2019t be a factor in the first place.)\nSo, to Recap \u2026\n1. You don\u2019t have to do anything if you don\u2019t want to, and there is no rush. If your private keys are secure, your BCH are secure.\n2. If you want to use your BCH in any way, it's probably best to first move your BTC to a whole new address that you control, or even to a whole new wallet generated from a new seed. (But don\u2019t lose your old private keys or seed: these still hold your BCH!)\n3. Once you know what you\u2019re doing, move your BCH either to a new address or wallet that you control, or perhaps to an exchange to sell, or whatever it is you want to do with your \u201cfree money.\u201d\nThis article will be updated as the news develops.", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 1}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nAugust 1 saw the birth of a brand-new cryptocurrency: \u201cBitcoin Cash,\u201d sometimes referred to as \u201cBcash\u201d and using the currency tickers \u201cBCH\u201d or \u201cBCC.\u201d Bitcoin Cash shares a history with Bitcoin, but yesterday it forked off to form its own blockchain and currency.\nHere\u2019s the story so far.\nThe Fork\nBitcoin Cash, initially defined by the Bitcoin ABC software implementation, was set to fork on August 1 at 12:20 p.m. UTC. Though, because of how Bitcoin nodes measure time, the actual fork happened a little bit later.\nStarting right when Bitcoin block 478,558 was found around 12:35 p.m. UTC, Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin Cash miners started looking for a different kind of block, each following their own protocol. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin has much more hash power attributed to its chain, a Bitcoin miner was the first to find one such block, marking the first block that was rejected by all Bitcoin Cash nodes. This effectively realized the \u201csplit,\u201d even though no new Bitcoin Cash block had yet been found.\nSince there weren\u2019t very many Bitcoin Cash miners on a network that did maintain Bitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty requirements, this first BCH block did not come fast. It took almost six hours, at about 6:15 p.m. UTC, until Chinese mining pool ViaBTC found the first Bitcoin Cash block. This, for many, made the \u201csplit\u201d official.\nAt the time of writing, the fork seems to be more or less successful, depending on how \u201csuccess\u201d is defined in this context. While there were some concerns about the peer-to-peer network \u2014 Bitcoin ABC nodes initially appeared unable to reach one another \u2014 these problems have seemed to resolve over time. And safety precautions like replay protection and wipeout protection seem to be properly enforced as well.\nThat said, infrastructure support for BCH is still\u00a0limited. Very few wallets and other Bitcoin services have adopted the new cryptocurrency so far \u2014 this could of course change in the (near) future.\nHash Power Issues\nThe bigger problem is probably that hash power on the Bitcoin Cash chain started out low and has remained low. As a result, confirmation times are extremely slow, often taking hours.\nThis should improve over time, especially because Bitcoin Cash implemented a new difficulty algorithm designed to faster adjust back to normal. However, even with this algorithm, it could take weeks before blocks are found at typical ten-minute block intervals.\nAdditionally, this difficulty adjustment algorithm could incentivize odd miner behavior. It has been speculated, for example, that miners intentionally mined no blocks for over 12 hours today, as that would help them get back to normal faster. And, notably, similar incentives would exist even once difficulty readjusts to normal on the Bitcoin Cash chain.\nMarket Behavior\nAs expected, price discovery has been very volatile during these first couple of Bitcoin Cash days. And perhaps more importantly, price discovery is still very limited, for three reasons in particular.\nFirst, as mentioned above, many Bitcoin users are still having difficulties accessing their BCH because not many wallets support the new currency. And even if wallets do support it, accessing BCH requires users to give up some level of privacy, security, time and more. This stops users from selling.\nSecond, hardly any exchanges have enabled BCH deposits yet. With some exceptions, only users who held BTC on exchanges that credited users with BCH at the time of the fork were able to sell their BCH. All users who controlled their own private keys have had to wait or find someone to sell their BCH to themselves.\nAnd third, because Bitcoin Cash blocks are slow and the chain insecure, even exchanges that do allow BCH deposits often take hours if not days to properly credit an account.\nAt time of writing, HitBTC is the only cryptocurrency exchange that allows BCH deposits within a reasonable timeframe. As such, it\u2019s arguably the first \u201creal\u201d BTC/BCH exchange. However, since HitBTC is not a very established name, many may still be hesitant to send their funds to this exchange. (Nor does Bitcoin Magazine recommend that you do so.)\nDespite all these factors, trading has started, and the market has seen some early price action. Since its launch, the BCH exchange rates on different trading platforms have bounced between some 0.05 BTC per BCH and 0.4 BTC per BCH. \nDisclaimer: The author of this article received BCH and has not sold all of it yet.", "year": 2017, "month": 8, "day": 3}

Hours after the activation of Bitcoin Cash, ViaBTC mined the first Bitcoin Cash block.\nAlso on August 1, Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s Aaron Van Wirdum released an extensive guide for bitcoin holders on claiming and selling Bitcoin Cash that has been credited to them. Essentially, the process involves private keys of bitcoin wallets that are held by users on non-custodial platforms. For users that have full control over their private keys, there is a manual process to undergo when attempting to retrieve Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\nCentralized bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms hold private keys for their users and thus, through exchanges, the process of claiming Bitcoin Cash is much simpler. \nTwo out of Five Major Bitcoin Exchanges in the U.S. Support Bitcoin Cash\nThe U.S. is the world\u2019s second largest bitcoin exchange market with a daily trading volume of $97 million with China taking the top spot. Only two of the top five bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms in the U.S., however, are supporting Bitcoin Cash crediting and withdrawals. Bitfinex and Kraken announced on July 27, 2017, that all accounts will be credited with BCH in the near future while Bitstamp, Gemini and GDAX have no plans on supporting BCH anytime soon.\nAt 6:35 PM GMT on August 1, Kraken announced that all of its accounts have been successfully credited with BCH. Around the same time, Bitfinex stated that its development team is also in the process of crediting BCH to all accounts but that no account had been credited yet.\nIn contrast, Bitstamp, Gemini and GDAX explicitly stated that the three exchanges will not support BCH. Both GDAX and Bitstamp addressed the issue by describing BCH as an alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) and that they are not in a position to support the digital currency.\n\u201cIt is important to clarify that Bitstamp would not be in a position to support Bitcoin Cash [BCH], the coin associated with the Bitcoin Cash proposal. In Bitstamp\u2019s view, [BCH] is an alt-coin and the decision to list BCC tokens remains at our sole discretion at all times,\u201d said the Bitstamp team.\nIn an interview with bitcoin analyst Tone Vays, Jimmy Song, principal architect at Paxos, suggested \u00a0that, in terms of security, it is not safe to immediately withdraw or credit BCH right after the fork.\nHence, it is still possible that exchanges like GDAX, Gemini and Bitstamp could decide to credit accounts with BCH in the future, rather than rushing into the development of a specific system to enable BCH withdrawals immediately after the fork.\nAll Bitcoin Exchanges in China Support BCH Withdrawal, Majority to List BTC/BCH Trading Pair\nEarlier this week, local Chinese cryptocurrency news agency CnLedger offered a chart demonstrating the decision of all Chinese bitcoin exchanges in regard to crediting and supporting Bitcoin Cash. All bitcoin exchanges in China will allocate BCH to users; in fact, the three largest bitcoin exchanges in the country, including OKCoin, Huobi and BTCChina, have already announced that they will list the BCH/BTC trading pair on their trading platforms.\n\nTwo of Three Major South Korean Bitcoin Exchanges Will Support Bitcoin Cash\nBithumb, South Korea\u2019s largest exchange with over 57 percent of the South Korean bitcoin exchange market share, and Korbit, the country\u2019s second largest bitcoin exchange, will support Bitcoin Cash. Interestingly, similar to major exchanges in China, Bithumb and Korbit aim to enable BCH trading if it gains traction among cryptocurrency investors and traders.\nMore importantly, South Korean bitcoin exchanges will credit their clients and all accounts with Bitcoin Cash at a 1:1 ratio based on the balance of bitcoin holders during the time of the fork.\n\u201cIn the event that Bitcoin Cash gains traction, we may enable Bitcoin Cash trading within a few days after the UAHF, if and when we deem it safe to do so. If we do, we plan to allocate to our users Bitcoin Cash at a 1:1 ratio with Bitcoin, based on users\u2019 Bitcoin balance at the time of the UAHF (~August 1st at 9:20pm KST),\u201d said the Korbit team on July 26, 2017.\nIn the upcoming months, as leading bitcoin exchanges in the Chinese and South Korean bitcoin exchange markets add support for BCH trading, interest in BCH will likely be concentrated in Asian markets.\nFull List of Bitcoin Exchanges and Wallets That Will Support Bitcoin Cash\nA full list of bitcoin exchanges and bitcoin wallets that have announced plans to support Bitcoin Cash that were not mentioned above can be seen below:\nWallets:\nLedger Nano STrezorJaxxCoinomiBitcoin UnlimitedBitcoin ClassicBitcoinABCFreewallet\nExchanges:\nBittrexKrakenBitfinexBitcoins NorwayMercury CashQuadrigaCXBTCBoxBithumbKorbit QuoineEX WalltimeLykkeCoinspot\nOther\n\nChangellyShapeshift\n\nGot any more to add to the list?

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nIn an attempt to provide transparency to customers, a group of livestock farmers in Arkansas is planning to implement blockchain technology to track the origins of meat products.\nEconomic development charity Heifer International published a press release on August 2 announcing a partnership between the Arkansas-based Grass Roots Farmers\u2019 Cooperative and the British startup Provenance. By using blockchain tech, customers will be able to track meat products \u201cfrom farm to fork.\u201d The farmers\u2019 co-op believes using the technology will boost the confidence of consumers since they will have more insight on the quality and origins of the meat they purchase.\nDetailed in a separate press release published by the Grass Roots Farmers\u2019 Cooperative, the farmers are planning to put QR codes on the meat products they sell, which customers can use to track their food on the blockchain using Provenance\u2019s platform. In addition to the quality and the origins of the meat, customers will be able to see how the animals were raised and gain insight into the people who contributed to producing the final product.\n\u201cAmericans have an increasing interest in better understanding what they\u2019re eating. According to the 2016 Label Insight Study, 83 percent of consumers want more information about what\u2019s in their food, and I totally believe it,\u201d Cody Hopkins, Grass Roots general manager and founding member, wrote.\n\u201cWhen I learned about this technology, I thought, \u2018This is the solution.\u2019 It\u2019s the perfect way for Grass Roots to offer folks total transparency. Provenance has developed a platform that levels the playing field for small-scale farmers and puts information directly in consumers\u2019 hands.\u201d \nAccording to Hopkins, the same study showed that 75 percent of the U.S. citizens polled stated they do not trust the accuracy of food labels.

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nAlphaBay, the most popular marketplace on the dark web, shut down on July 4. At first, many of the users suspected an exit scam; however, it has since become clear that law enforcement has taken down the underground market. According to the Wall Street Journal, an international police action took place in the United States, Thailand and Canada.\nOn July 5, law enforcement in Thailand arrested Alexandre Cazes, 26, a Canadian citizen who is believed to be one of the operators of AlphaBay. On the same day, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) executed a search warrant at a residence in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec, where a high-technology crime unit seized computer equipment.\nMelissa Sweeney, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, stated Cazes was taken into custody by Thai authorities \u201cwith a view toward extradition to face federal criminal charges in the United States.\u201d According to the Wall Street Journal, it wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether the defendant had legal representation.\nOn Wednesday, Cazes was found hanged in his prison cell at the Narcotics Suppression Bureau in Bangkok, Thailand. The death of the alleged AlphaBay operator was confirmed by a spokeswoman for Canada\u2019s foreign affairs department on Thursday. However, she declined to comment further on the case due to privacy reasons. \nAccording to the Bangkok Post, the body of Cazes was found by a duty officer who noticed a towel hanging from the toilet door in his cell. When the officer entered the cell, where the suspect was held alone, he found Cazes dead. Authorities believe the suspect used the towel to hang himself.\nCazes had been living in Thailand with his wife for eight years, working as a computer programmer. The Criminal Court in Thailand issued a warrant for the suspect\u2019s arrest on June 30 at the request of U.S. law enforcement authorities. According to the Bangkok Post, during the arrest on July 5 in the Thawi Watthana district of Bangkok, investigators seized four Lamborghini cars and three houses worth approximately 400 million baht in total (nearly $12 million).\nAlphaBay was founded in December 2014, taking the place of the Silk Road Marketplace, which was seized by the FBI in October 2013. Andrei Barysevich, a director at the threat intelligence company Recorded Future Inc., told the Wall Street Journal that AlphaBay not only focused on the sale of drugs, but also allowed the advertising of products and services that other underground markets banned, such as stolen credit card numbers and online fraud tutorials. The researcher stated that AlphaBay sold more than $5 million worth of stolen credit card information in the first half of 2017 alone.\nNicolas Christin, an associate research professor at Carnegie Mellon University studying underground marketplaces, said the total sales on AlphaBay had an average of $600,000 to $800,000 a day. That means the marketplace earned millions of dollars in commissions every year.\nSome users on the /r/DarkNetMarkets subreddit blamed the vulnerabilities of AlphaBay for the shutdown of the website.\n\u201cAn AB vulnerability leading to an IP leak or other de-anonymization issue would not be a surprise \u2014 how many bugs were there over the years reported here [in the subreddit]?

He is interested in the economics of money and payments and was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013. He holds some bitcoin and various altcoins.\nOn Thursday, the smart contract protocol Counterparty reached its millionth transaction. Bitcoin Magazine received an update on the status of the project from Shawn Leary, the newly elected Counterparty community director.\nCounterparty was launched in January 2014 with the creation of its native currency, XCP. Unlike typical ICOs (initial coin offerings) today that transfer funds to the founders, XCP was created by \u201cburning\u201d bitcoins, whereby bitcoins were sent to a special address (one for which no one owned the private key) that rendered them unspendable. Those who destroyed their bitcoins in this manner in return received an amount of XCP in proportion to their bitcoins lost. \nThis \u201cproof of burn\u201d process put all Bitcoin users, including the founders, on an equal footing in terms of obtaining the native XCP token. According to Leary, the Counterparty team hopes that its unique founding sets the tone to attract new projects that won\u2019t take advantage of users\u2019 funds.\n\u201cWe want to continue this legacy and hope it wards off scams and attracts genuine projects that use our protocol for what it was intended: decentralized markets,\u201d said Leary.\nCounterparty doesn\u2019t have its own blockchain; rather, it exists entirely via the Bitcoin blockchain. All actions taken on Counterparty are made through ordinary Bitcoin transactions using XCP as the \u201cfuel\u201d that is spent. This means that Counterparty transactions are protected by the hashing power of Bitcoin, so a double spend would require a 51 percent attack on the Bitcoin blockchain itself.\nCounterparty Project: More Than Games\nLeary described an indie-game network that is \u201cgrowing leaps and bounds around Counterparty.\u201d This market is arguably where Counterparty has had its greatest impact. The first of these games to rise to prominence was Spells of Genesis, with its token launch in 2015. \nSince then, many gaming projects have flourished on Counterparty. The Rare Pepe project currently has over 1,000 digital collectible trading cards registered via Counterparty for use in games such as SaruTobi Island and Rare Pepe Party. The augmented reality game Augmentors has also successfully raised over $1,000,000 in bitcoins in a token sale on Counterparty of the in-game asset Databits, and even won investor Vinny Lingham\u2019s support during an episode of Shark Tank. Augmentors is currently in beta and is planning for a launch in 2018.\nBut there is more to Counterparty than just games. Generally, Counterparty is helping anyone create digital assets with smart contract properties that are protected by the hashing power of the Bitcoin blockchain.\nFor instance, Counterparty\u2019s FoldingCoin is aimed at rewarding those who provide computing power to Stanford\u2019s Folding@home project to aid in the study of diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and many cancers. \nIn collaboration with Storj, Counterparty developed Pico payments, which will be implemented to reduce the cost of microtransactions. \nProbably their most widely used token, LTBCOIN, has been used by the LTB Network for a few years now. In fact, over 17 percent of all Counterparty transactions have been with LTBCOIN.\n\u201cEvery protocol has its deficiencies and quirks,\u201d Adam B. Levine, Editor-in-Chief of the Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin! Show, said to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cCounterparty is no different. \u00a0What I like about it is that we've been building with it long enough that I understand those risks and challenges. We've already solved most of them, like accepting dollar payments for tokens and giving token buyers the feeling of instant fulfillment when they'd otherwise be waiting for blockchain confirmations.\u201d \nThe Scaling Debate: Preparing for What\u2019s Next\nThe Counterparty team has not taken a definitive position on the various scaling proposals, but continues to run Bitcoin Core. Leary told Bitcoin Magazine that there are two routes Counterparty could take to account for a network fork. If Counterparty supports a hard fork in advance, they will \u201crelease a new version of Counterparty utilizing the new Bitcoin client, and users must switch to this new Bitcoin client as well as the updated Counterparty version before the specific Bitcoin fork occurs.\u201d\nAlternatively, if a fork occurs that they did not account for ahead of time, they have the option to \u201cfreeze\u201d Counterparty balances at a specific block height on the old chain and transition to a new chain at an indicated block height. In this case, \u201cthere would be some downtime, but the process would be announced well in advance with clear instructions provided for everyone.\u201d\nThe team also emphasized that since Counterparty exists entirely through the Bitcoin blockchain, there can be no such thing as a fork in Counterparty itself. Counterparty nodes do not need to coordinate with one another, since all nodes simply need to monitor the canonical Bitcoin blockchain, whatever the Counterparty protocol defines that to be.\nContinuing Improvements\nCounterparty is still continually improved with development led by core maintainers Ruben de Vries and Devon Weller. There are currently two Counterparty Improvement Proposals (CIPs) outstanding, CIP 9 and CIP 10. Both are aimed at reducing costs for transactions over the network. The team is also raising funds to upgrade counterwallet.io.\nEditor\u2019s Note: The LTB Network is a property of BTC Media.\n", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 17}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin miners at large have missed the first BIP 148 \u201cdeadline\u201d to prevent a \u201csplit\u201d in Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s scaling dispute appears to be heading for a climax, the next couple of weeks could prove pivotal. One scaling solution in particular, Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 (\u201cBIP 148\u201d), is scheduled to trigger activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) on August 1, 00:00 UTC. As a User Activated Soft Fork (UASF), all users that run a BIP 148 node will then start rejecting any and all blocks that do not signal support for SegWit by the \u201cdeadline\u201d \u2014 or, perhaps more accurately, \u201cultimatum\u201d \u2014 set by BIP 148 users.\nBIP 148 and SegWit are backward-compatible protocol upgrades, which means that non-upgraded nodes will still accept SegWit-signaling and SegWit-utilizing blocks. Therefore, if a majority of hash power in one way or another adopts SegWit before August 1, all current Bitcoin nodes would follow the same blockchain. \nHowever, if only a minority of miners activates SegWit through BIP 148, Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain and currency would \u201csplit\u201d in two. This\u00a0would result in two types of \u201cBitcoin\u201d: one that activated BIP 148 and one that did not, while\u00a0even more\u00a0types of \u201cBitcoin\u201d could emerge as a result.\u00a0A split between BIP148-nodes and non-BIP148 nodes would last at least until a majority of hash power joins the BIP 148 chain, or until the BIP 148 chain is abandoned by all users and miners for good.\nMiners essentially have three options to avoid such a split. This first option was to lock in SegWit before August 1 through the activation mechanism proposed by Bitcoin Core and implemented in many nodes on the network. This required 95 percent of hash power to signal support for the upgrade within a two-week difficulty period. Specifically, such a difficulty period consists of 2,016 of these sequential blocks, which means that a minimum of 1,916 blocks must signal support. Or, in other words, if more than 100 blocks \u2014 at least 101 of them \u2014 do not signal support for SegWit within a single difficulty period that ends before August 1, this BIP 148 deadline is missed.\nIgnoring extreme statistical deviations or other unexpected events, the final difficulty period to end before August 1 started on Friday (UTC). And out of the first day and a half worth of blocks within this difficulty period, only about half of them signaled support for Segregated Witness. This means that the threshold of 101 blocks not signaling support has now been reached.\nWith two more BIP 148 deadlines ahead, the first one was probably also the most likely to be missed. Its threshold was the hardest of the three to achieve as it required the highest level of hash rate to succeed. Additionally, a large majority of miners (by hash power) indicates that they will activate SegWit through BIP 91 instead. This is the next BIP 148 deadline.\nThis next deadline will be on July 29. This is the last day that BIP 91 can activate in time to be compatible with BIP 148. In order to do so, 80 percent of hash power must have signaled support for SegWit2x within 2 1/3 days. As such, miners should at the very latest start signaling support for BIP 91 on the 26th of July. Though like the now-missed BIP141 deadline, which is technically not until August 31, the BIP 91 deadline could actually be either missed or met before July 29 as well.\nIf this next BIP 91 deadline is missed too, miners will have one more chance to avoid a \u201csplit.\u201d A majority of hash power would have to activate SegWit through BIP 148 itself by August 1, 00:00 UTC. Alternatively, a majority of hash power could switch to the BIP 148 chain even after August 1 to reunite both chains, but this will likely cause significant disruption on the Bitcoin network(s), and potentially a loss of funds for users not aware of the risks.\n\nFor more information on how to keep your bitcoins safe during a potential coin-split, click here.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 15}

Solving the puzzles quickly requires some knowledge and skill, but mostly the challenges are designed to be \u201cgeeky fun\u201d for anyone involved with Bitcoin to some degree. \nOn Saturday, contestants can register and access a number of challenges of varying degrees of difficulty on CoinGate\u2019s website and on /r/Bitcoin here. \nIn preparation for the second contest, the Reddit thread is a good source of examples with answers from the last challenge, which began on July 1. \nDuring the July 1st challenge, there was considerable discussion on Reddit among contestants. \n\u201cWe were really surprised that participants started sharing their thoughts on our Reddit thread, even though there was only one prize for each riddle,\u201d the Coingate team told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAnd so all the riddles were solved and prizes snapped up within just 3 hours.\n\u201cOur team is really happy with the results and the number of participants [the challenge] attracted. All in all, we logged over 800 attempts and more than 600 people who were up to solve the tasks in a matter of several hours.\u201d\nContestants received a series of puzzles to choose from, leading to a Bitcoin private key and the address for a wallet containing BTC.\nThree challenges of varying difficulty were launched at once, with the most difficult taking from 4-6 hours to solve. As is evident on the Reddit comments, some found the puzzles baffling while a few seemed more than ready for the challenge.\nIn one puzzle, for example, contestants were given a grid of four CoinGate logos that seemed identical. A private key was hidden in the image and the participants had to figure out what was hidden and assemble the private key leading to the reward.\nMost of the puzzles involve steganography \u2014 extracting of the meaning of a secret message hidden within an ordinary message.\nSome of the solutions will provide a private key, while some others will provide another method to retrieve bitcoins, for example in the form of a wallet \u201cseed.\u201d\nThe end goal of each challenge is to get access to a Bitcoin address by finding its private key (or otherwise). Depending on the difficulty of the challenge, that address will contain a reward of 0.01 to 0.1 BTC. (The prize will be sent to a Bitcoin address just before the challenge.) \nCoinGate: On SegWit and UASF\nCoinGate CTO Rytis Bieliauskas told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cCoinGate is seeking to attract people back to the basics of Bitcoin and blockchain [technology]. Having been involved in the Bitcoin world since 2011, we deeply love the original blockchain and we strongly believe that consensus [on scaling] will be reached.\u201d\nBieliauskas is concerned about the direction Bitcoin is taking and is asking Bitcoiners to remember what the original essence and intent of Bitcoin was.\nBieliauskas considers himself to be a Core supporter but is hopeful all parties involved will come to a consensus on how to scale Bitcoin.\nOn the CoinGate blog, he wrote:\n\u201cWe strongly believe in a future for Bitcoin. As we have officially stated previously, our team strongly supports SegWit as the best Bitcoin scaling solution, and we therefore maintain a close eye on BIP148 (UASF).\u201d\nIn an email from the CoinGate team, a representative explained: \u201cWe have officially expressed our support for SegWit and UASF back in April, though we have not made any comment on the SegWit2x as it was coined after the New York Agreement. We strongly support any scaling solution that will help Bitcoin grow and become accessible and useful to people across the globe. \n\u201cHowever, since we are involved with Bitcoin from its technical side, we know that a scaling solution must not only seem viable \u2018on paper,\u2019 but also undergo rigorous testing before it can be launched across the network.\u201d\nRegardless of what the future brings, CoinGate has expressed that it is here to stay:\n\u201c[W]hatever the changes in the Bitcoin landscape, our team is ready to adjust to any technological developments. In the end, our goal has always been to make cryptocurrencies accessible, simple and convenient for both businesses and individuals.\u201d\nCoinGate is a payment gateway/processor for bitcoin and more than 40 altcoins including Litecoin, Ethereum, Zcash, Monero, Dash, Ripple and Golem.

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nBitPay has been very much focused on the issues around transaction capacity on the Bitcoin network lately, which eventually led them to support the New York Agreement (also known as SegWit2x). In comments shared with Bitcoin Magazine, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair clarified the company\u2019s view on the SegWit2x proposal and hard forks more generally.\nWhile Pair has indicated that BitPay is working on off-chain payment solutions unrelated to the often-touted lightning network, BitPay would also like to see on-chain capacity increase by way of a hard fork during this \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the technology\u2019s adoption by more users.\nIn the interview, Pair noted that BitPay understands the concerns around implementing a hard-forking increase to the block size limit, but he also added that SegWit2x is the best option for scaling available right now.\nYou can read all of Pair\u2019s responses to questions from Bitcoin Magazine below.\nBitcoin Magazine: When you were on Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin a few months ago, you said you didn\u2019t think a hard fork would be a good idea at the time and Bitcoin would still be fine if it never forked, but now you are pushing SegWit2x. So, what changed?\nStephen Pair: Actually, I said that I didn\u2019t think a contentious hard fork to Bitcoin Unlimited was the best way of increasing on-chain capacity. \nOur view is that you need balance between the cost of putting a transaction in the blockchain and the cost of running a full node. Both will get increasingly expensive as Bitcoin adoption grows, but the system doesn\u2019t make any sense to us if either one is substantially more expensive than the other. \nAt the moment we are in favor of SegWit2x because it is the least contentious option for activating SegWit (which will enable layer 2 payments innovation) while simultaneously alleviating congestion in the short term. Our view might be different if Bitcoin wasn\u2019t at a critical stage of adoption (it is), or 2 MB blocks were a risk to the system (it isn\u2019t), or layer 2 payments were production ready (they aren\u2019t). At some point even layer 2 payments are going to put an immense amount of capacity pressure on layer 1.\nThe debate in the community is no longer primarily big block vs. small block; it is extremists on either side vs. moderates. SegWit2x allows most of the community to remain on the same chain for at least a little while longer. If SegWit2x fails, then we will likely have a chain split sooner rather than later, which, by the way, isn\u2019t necessarily all bad. It would allow more freedom for people to pursue their vision of scaling. In many ways a split would make Bitcoin twice as likely to succeed.\nBM: In a perfect world, would you prefer to activate SegWit now and then take a wait-and-see approach on a hard-forking increase to the block size limit?\nSP: No, we believe a modest on-chain capacity increase is important as well. The concerns that many people have about doing so are related to increasing the cost of running a full node, the governance precedent it might set, and that increasing on-chain capacity becomes the path of least resistance and will reduce the incentive for layer 2 innovations. We fully understand and share these concerns, as I believe most supporters of SegWit2x do, but we still believe it\u2019s the best of the available options.\nBM: What are your thoughts on implementing a big block sidechain (federated or Drivechain) as a way to increase capacity while not affecting system requirements for running a main chain full node? Or would you prefer an extension block?\nSP: There are many fans of Drivechain at BitPay and we are very optimistic about it. In fact, as we were working with the bcoin team on extension blocks, the topic of Drivechain came up quite a bit. I really wanted to figure out if there was an opportunity to enhance the extension block work into Drivechain (and there may yet be). The extension block implementation was simply a way of achieving a block size increase without requiring a hard fork, but we don\u2019t view it as a long-term capacity solution.\nI also want to mention UASF. While we like the idea of miners making informed decisions related to consensus rules based on the needs of their users (like us), we think an activist-led deployment of a soft fork is extremely dangerous. The plan for deploying extension blocks would likely have taken a very similar approach. We believe that the only appropriate and peaceful response to a failure to gain the support of the hashrate majority would be to create a safe hard fork with re-org and replay protection. In order to protect itself, we think the community should unambiguously reject the notion of an activist-led soft fork deployment.\nLastly, BitPay is going to follow the hashrate majority in the immediate and foreseeable future. That means that whatever consensus changes the hashrate majority adopts, we will as well. That is really the only option for us and our customers. In the longer term, if a fork of Bitcoin emerges that we think might better serve our needs and the needs of our customers, we may evaluate a transition to that fork. But at the present time, we believe the consensus changes embodied in SegWit2x are acceptable.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 17}

If you are reading this article, you are probably wondering what the heck just happened and if the carnage is going to continue ...\nFirst, let\u2019s take a look at how the market reacted to the completion of this Head and Shoulders pattern and then extrapolate what that may mean for the overall trend of BTC-USD. The figure below shows the key support levels that were broken during the fall this weekend:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 6-hr Candles, GDAX, Head and Shoulders Key Support Levels\nAfter the initial breakout of the Head and Shoulders, the price took a steep plunge downward. Ultimately, after several days of a strong bear market (and several significant support levels broken), we reached our price target of $1,800 before bouncing and beginning the process of retesting crucial support (now turned resistance) levels:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 6-hr Candles, GDAX, Broken Support Levels\nWith very little effort, the BTC-USD market managed to reach its price target and appears to be making a recovery \u2014 but is this a fake-out? Are we bouncing back to our previous trend? Not likely. Below are some of the more glaring reasons why I think this bear still has some bite left in it.\nOn the higher timescales, BTC-USD is actually showing strength in downward momentum of this move. No MACD divergence (loss in market momentum) is visible. The lack of macro-trend divergence indicates that the market still has plenty of downward pull left in it before it strongly begins to resist the lower prices.\nFigure 4: BTC-USD, 12-hr Candles, GDAX, No Divergence\nOn a smaller, one-hour scale, the market is strongly diverging in a bearish fashion. Although the market had a decent rebound off the bottom of the recent run, it is quickly losing steam (indicated by the divergence shown on the 1-hr MACD and labeled in pink). Not only is it diverging on the 1-hr MACD, across the length of the bear run, the market doesn\u2019t seem comfortable maintaining the downward momentum across multiple bearish/bullish periods (shown in yellow):\nFigure 5: BTC-USD, 1-hr Candles, GDAX, 1HR Bearish Divergence\nIt\u2019s nearly impossible to predict the true bottom of a sustained bear or bull market, so it is very important to keep an eye on the market and constantly update your perspective. At the moment, there are several indicators that BTC-USD has a sustained bear market in its future. And, as we\u2019ve seen over the course of several weeks: what brings Bitcoin down brings everyone down.\nSummary:\nThe Head and Shoulders pattern predicted in previous articles completed its price target of $1,800.There are multiple signs that the BTC-USD bear market still has downward momentum left in it.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nSamourai Wallet is becoming increasingly popular as a wallet that focuses on privacy and security for its users above all else, but a recent tool released by this wallet\u2019s team of developers has a focus on user experience. The new app, called Bitcoin Afterburner, allows users of many different bitcoin wallets to boost transactions that have become stuck due to low fees.\nThe app works for transactions that have been sent or received, and it is compatible with all BIP 39 and BIP 44 wallets. Examples of compatible wallets include Mycelium, Blockchain.info, Airbitz and Electrum.\nTo get more details about Bitcoin Afterburner and the concept of fee bumping in general, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to the anonymous CEO of Samourai Wallet.\n\u201cAfterburner is one more example of how we are experimenting and developing ways of monetizing our business without resorting to accepting fiat or exposing our users to harmful KYC/AML collection,\u201d said the CEO.\nSamourai Wallet monetizes the Bitcoin Afterburner app by adding a $5.99 fee for helping users with their stuck transactions. This fee is added to the child-pays-for-parent (CPFP) transaction that is used to bump the user\u2019s bitcoin transaction fee. CPFP is a process by which the recipient of a transaction can spend the inputs of an unconfirmed transaction by using them in a new transaction that has a higher fee (and incentivizes miners to mine both transactions at once).\nThe full question and answer session with the CEO of Samourai Wallet can be read below.\n\nBitcoin Magazine: Will fee bumping eventually become the norm on Bitcoin?\nSamourai Wallet: We believe that over time as legitimate transactions start to fill block space, and a fee market begins to mature, wallets that have implemented sophisticated fee management mechanisms such as fee bumping will provide their users with the most competitive transaction fees and confirmation times. The tech is there today, the challenge \u2014 and it isn't a small challenge \u2014 is entirely UX. We're working on this today while others are playing catch-up.\nBM: Could you compare and contrast this app with the transaction accelerators offered by ViaBTC and BTC.com?\nSW: The difference between the miner operated TX Accelerators is that Afterburner is not an off-chain 1-to-1 with a specific miner. Instead, Afterburner broadcasts a bitcoin transaction to all miners using the standard bitcoin p2p network. All the miners on the network compete for the new transaction with the higher fee, meaning it often works much quicker than the miner operated TX Accelerators. Afterburner was very much a defensive response to the miners who have been blocking SegWit activation and broadcasting empty blocks, some of those same miners are the ones who run the TX Accelerators. \nBM: Is Bitcoin Afterburner getting much use so far?\nSW: Afterburner has a good number of installs, but not many paid 'Boosts.' A few days after we released Afterburner the transaction backlog that was driving up fees and confirmation times completely dried up. The fees required for next block confirmation dropped from 300 sat/b to 25 sat/b. Once the mempool gets saturated again, we will have a much better idea of the potential utility of the app. \nBM: Why do you think more wallet providers don\u2019t offer this sort of service?\nSW: Many wallet providers \u2014 inexplicably the most well-funded ones are the most guilty \u2014 haven't invested any time into proper fee estimation and management until very recently. A misguided industry-driven quest to make the bitcoin wallet for \u201cgrandma\u201d resulted in an unusable bitcoin wallet for actual users. Samourai has focused from inception on actual bitcoin users first.\nBM: Do you think this sort of fee bumping will eventually be free? Does Samourai Wallet offer fee bumping like this natively or do they need to use this separate app?\nSW: Samourai Wallet provides the exact same functionality as Afterburner natively. Afterburner was designed to allow users of any other BIP 44 HD wallet to boost their stuck transaction using CPFP (Child-Pays-for-Parent) under the hood. Hopefully they move over to Samourai Wallet if they are satisfied with the service. In addition to CPFP-based boosting more advanced users may opt-in to RBF-based boosting which is also available in the wallet. Both options are available to Samourai Wallet users free of charge.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 18}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nBitcoin is a decentralized system of digital cash in which users don\u2019t need to trust anyone else with their money; however, the full benefits of this technology are only seen when users operate a full node on the network. The vast majority of Bitcoin users do not operate their own full nodes, but one man is trying to change that with a piece of hardware he calls the Bitcoin Block Clock Jr.\nThere are many good reasons for individual Bitcoiners to operate a full node. Full nodes are responsible for validating transactions and blocks on the Bitcoin network. Only by running full nodes can users know with full certainty that they received a valid payment. Additionally, the more users that run full nodes, the more decentralized the Bitcoin network is, making it harder to shut down or corrupt. \nAnd as Sia Co-Founder David Vorick pointed out in a talk at this year\u2019s MIT Bitcoin Expo, those who do not operate their own full nodes do not get a say in the matter when hard forks are deployed on the network. \u201cIf you\u2019re not running a full node \u2026 your opinion on whether or not you like a hard fork is less relevant because, ultimately, if you\u2019re not validating the rules and someone gives you a transaction following a different rule set, you don\u2019t have a way to detect that,\u201d he explained.\nRunning a full node, however, has been a rather expensive proposition. As a result, larger, economically invested entities that are better able to support full nodes have had more of a say.\nAccording to Vorick, users can be dragged along with miners and large businesses if the cost of running a full node is too high: \u201cIf full nodes are expensive to run, only people who are capable of running nodes really have any say in what happens in a contentious upgrade.\u201d\nMatthew Zipkin is the man behind the Bitcoin Block Clock. A sound engineer by trade, he has been working in his spare time on creating full nodes that are both affordable and fun to use. During a recent discussion with Bitcoin Magazine, Zipkin revealed his desire to create a piece of hardware for operating a low-cost Bitcoin full node that isn\u2019t boring.\nA Bitcoin Full Node That Isn\u2019t Boring\nWhen commenting on his reasoning for creating the Bitcoin Block Clock, Zipkin pointed to the full node devices made by Bitnodes before they were acquired by 21.\n\u201cI always wanted one, but they disappeared when they got bought out, so I decided to build my own,\u201d said Zipkin.\nWhile there are other full node options out there, such as Bitseed, Zipkin wanted to make something that was more than a piece of computer hardware that would sit on the floor next to a router. Zipkin wanted to turn a Bitcoin full node into a work of art, and that\u2019s exactly what he did.\nZipkin built the first version of the Bitcoin Block Clock last year, and it was on display at the SF Bitcoin Meetup\u2019s \u201cProof of Art\u201d event in May of 2016. After receiving positive feedback at the event and on Reddit, Zipkin decided to make a smaller version of the full node hardware to sell.\nThe Bitcoin Block Clock included a screen that displayed various live information about the Bitcoin network. Zipkin put the original version of the Bitcoin Block Clock for sale on OpenBazaar and Purse.io, but it hasn\u2019t sold.\n\u201cI priced it pretty high because it\u2019s art and I love it and kind of want to keep it,\u201d explained Zipkin. \u201cSo of course it still has not sold.\u201d\nCreating the Bitcoin Block Clock Jr. With Bcoin\nIn an effort to create a version of the Bitcoin Block Clock that could be produced at a lower price, Zipkin turned to Raspberry Pi Zero and Bcoin, which is an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol written in Node.js.\n\u201cI discovered Bcoin was super easy to install and use, and the codebase was easier for me to review because it\u2019s in Javascript instead of C++, and was built from scratch by a small group of developers (basically just two guys), so everything is really well labeled and consistent,\u201d explained Zipkin.\nOf course, the problem with using SPV mode is that it\u2019s not a full node and the device won\u2019t receive all of the information related to a new Bitcoin block as it\u2019s mined on the network. Zipkin opted for the pruned full node option in Bcoin in an effort to lower the system resources required to operate the node on Raspberry Pi Zero.\n\u201cWith pruning, I get all the fun block details I wanted to display,\u201d said Zipkin. \u201cI even submitted a pull request (which got merged!) to Bcoin to make my application work even easier.\u201d\nZipkin described the LED displays on the Bitcoin Block Clock Jr. as follows:\n\u201cThe Bitcoin Block Clock Jr. has two LED rings. The outer ring of 24 LEDs indicates recent blocks. Each LED represents 2 minutes, and they \u201ctick\u201d clockwise around the ring. The color of the LED is determined by the block\u2019s version (BIP 9 version bits combined with keywords from the Coinbase scriptSig like \u201c/EXTBLK\u201d or \u201c/EB1/AD6/\u201d). The inner 16-LED ring indicates the progress of the current difficulty period (2,016 blocks, or about two weeks). It starts blue and gradually turns more and more red as the meter fills up. The tiny little display screen indicates some details about the latest block: height, size, version (and extra scriptSig version) and the adjustment period progress. I added a little web interface so I could turn the lights off at night without having to SSH into the Pi every time.\u201d\n\nAn Economical Way to Contribute to the Network\nWhile Zipkin noted that the original Bitcoin Block Clock displays much more information and also comes with full wallet functionality, he also pointed out that the latest model proves that Bitcoin users only need about $20 to run their own full nodes (at least in pruned mode).\nHaving said that, Zipkin admitted that the Bitcoin Block Clock Jr. can struggle to keep up with the network at times.\n\u201cBcoin plus my Python script and all the GPIO display output just barely hangs in there on this tiny underpowered computer,\u201d said Zipkin. \u201cThe Python script has a method to restart Bcoin when it crashes and monitor it as it catches up to the network.\u201d\nAll of the technical details of the Bitcoin Block Clock Jr. are open source and can be found on GitHub.\nZipkin has now placed the Bitcoin Block Clock Jr. for sale on OpenBazaar and Purse.io.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 18}

BRI contributes the business-level use cases, setting the agenda for strategy leaders. BAC is a major advocacy organization, and ICTC is a long-time, established industry player, well known to high-tech businesses in Canada. \nBlockchain Association of Canada: Call to Action\nKyle Kemper, Executive Director of the Blockchain Association of Canada, is working on the supercluster application letter of intent and told us the only thing they\u2019re short of is time to get their application in to the ministry.\nHe pointed out that it is imperative that blockchain companies and organizations express their support for and commitment to the bid before the application deadline.\n\u201cThis supercluster initiative is an opportunity to take blockchain technology mainstream and for Canada to take a lead role,\u201d Kemper told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIn the bid process we are receiving unanimous support from public, private, academic, philanthropic and non-profit organizations.\u201d\nIf the group manages to secure $50 million in funding commitments from these organizations as part of a successful bid, the federal government will match the next $50 million for each supercluster. The commitments and matched funds will be spread over 5 years, according to the proposal.\nBlockchain Research Institute: No Room for Complacency\nDon Tapscott, Executive Director of the BRI, notes that many of the other bids like AI, machine learning, the Internet of Things and Quantum are all dependent on blockchain technology as a foundation. \n\u201cThe blockchain supercluster proposal is late to the table in part because this extraordinary technology is just becoming mainstream,\u201d Tapscott told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBut it\u2019s no less important than any of the others. In fact, it\u2019s foundational to everything else.\u201d \nIn a report called The Blockchain Corridor: Building an Innovation Economy in the 2nd Era of the Internet, Don and Alex Tapscott lay out a blueprint for a blockchain tech supercluster and Centre of Excellence in the already highly active \u201ccorridor\u201d between Toronto and Waterloo, Ontario.\nThe report says:\n\u201cWe cannot afford to be complacent, nor is time on our side. Canada\u2019s leading position in the Blockchain Revolution could quickly evaporate as other hotbeds around the world, such as Berlin, Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo, Sydney, London and New York (to say nothing of Silicon Valley) race ahead. The time to act is now.\u201d\nAccording to the report, the corridor could collectively generate around 170,000 new jobs and around $17 billion in GDP by the year 2025.\nTapscott added:\n\u201cBlockchain represents nothing less than the second era of the Internet. The first was based in Silicon Valley. As we show in the Blockchain Corridor Report, the second could be based in Canada.\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced that we can find $50 million from the private sector for this initiative. So I sure hope that governments will ensure we have a seat at the table going forward to make our case.\u201d\nColliderX: The Underdog Challenge\nBid partner ColliderX is a new\u00a0non-profit social enterprise working\u00a0to promote and develop R&D initiatives in the Canadian blockchain tech sector. \nColliderX founder and CEO Iliana Oris Valiente notes that the four bid partner organizations complement each other to create a dynamic supercluster.\n\u201cBeing considered by ISED to move on to the next stage of the selection process will be a win for the blockchain industry as it will signal Canada's support of this ecosystem,\u201d Valiente said to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cWe're certainly the underdog in this scenario but are promoting a truly new industry, rather than continued investments in areas that are already more established.\u201d\nInformation and Communications Technology Council\nICTC is an established industry player that brings a wealth of experience in economic development activities and will be involved in bridging the gap between the blockchain industry and a wider segment of the business and political community.\nNamir Anani, President & CEO of ICTC, believes that competition to win supercluster funding will be tough but notes that small- and medium-sized entreprises (like most blockchain startups) represent the large majority of Canada's competitive businesses. \nAnani says they will make the point that blockchain technology is a cross-industry enabler and a key catalyst for heightening small business growth and competitiveness in Canada.\nAnani told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cThe global blockchain market is growing at a staggering CAGR [Compound Annual Growth Rate] of 58.7 percent, according to Transparency Market Research. Capitalizing on this fast growth market is key for Canada's economy and employment potential going forward.\n\u201cAs Canada continues to expand its trade agreements in an increasingly global market, such as with the newly ratified Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreements (CETA), blockchain is a pivotal trade enabler for fast-tracking Canada's place in the global economy.\u201d\nMaking the Deadline\nValiente is confident that crowdfunding will bring in the needed amounts. To date, she has raised\u00a0$2 million in pledges on behalf of ColliderX, which will be rolled into the supercluster.\u00a0\nAnani is also confident the private sector will come forward and is passionate about selling the supercluster bid.\n\u201cBlockchain has the potential of reshaping all aspects of the global economy in the next number of years, building Canada\u2019s comparative advantage in this space is paramount going forward. The Blockchain Supercluster is a powerful pan-Canadian collaboration that will unleash cross-industry innovations, new economic opportunities and employment prospects for Canadians.\u201d \nKemper reiterated the need for industry support in order for the initiative to succeed. \u201cI urge all organizations that support Blockchain technology and organizations looking to better understand the potential to go to blockchainsc.ca, fill out a letter of commitment and share this news to rally more people to the cause by 12:00 EST on Friday, July 21.\u201d\nThus far, C4 and the Institute on Governance are among those supporting the bid as sponsors.\nThe group has until December 31, 2017, to raise the remaining supercluster-specific private-sector funding.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 19}

The affected wallets include the ones using Parity client version 1.5 or later.\nAccording to a tweet by Project Lead Manuel Ar\u00e1oz, the three multisig wallets first targeted by the hack were using Parity client version 1.5 or later, and included Edgeless Casino, Swarm City and \u00c6ternity Blockchain. However, Project Blocktix also reported a loss totaling 3,916 ETH. According to ETHNews, Blocktix.io was hit by a second attacker who exploited the same vulnerability.\nA Swarm City blog post revealed that a group of white hat hackers managed to secure the remaining funds from the affected ETH wallets using the same exploit.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nWhile Segregated Witness (SegWit) activation is looking more likely by the hour, Bitfury is getting ready to deploy a version of the Lightning network with or without the protocol upgrade.\nThe blockchain technology company, perhaps best known for its Bitcoin mining pool of the same name, successfully sent real bitcoins over a test version of the Lightning Network this week. Interestingly, Bitfury\u2019s implementation of the technology is compatible with the current Bitcoin protocol and is therefore functional even without SegWit.\n\u201cThis is a major accomplishment by our technical team and an important step forward for the Lightning Network and the growth of Bitcoin,\u201d Valery Vavilov, CEO of The Bitfury Group, said in a statement.\nLightning Network\nThe Lightning Network is a highly anticipated second-layer scaling solution that allows for cheap and instant (micro)payments. Cleverly leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s basic scripting capabilities, Lightning users should be able to make a virtually unlimited number of transactions, where only a minimal proportion of them are recorded on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, thereby boosting Bitcoin\u2019s scalability. Meanwhile, all users remain in control of their own bitcoins at all times, maintaining the trustless properties of Bitcoin itself.\n\u201cThe Lightning Network has the potential to solve Bitcoin\u2019s scalability issue and provide instant payment functionality. By demonstrating that the Lightning Network can function now, Bitfury has cleared the way to increased transaction processing and further adoption of Bitcoin,\u201d Vavilov said.\nBitfury\u2019s Lightning implementation is based on LND, which is being developed by Lightning Labs.\nFor its demo, the Bitfury software team created two Lightning transactions. One of these is a straight transaction from one Lightning node to the next, effectively simulating a payment channel between two users. Since it was only a test, Bitfury only made one transaction \u2014 but it could have made thousands back and forth at no extra cost.\nThe other test was a single-hop transaction, which better simulates the main purpose of the Lightning Network. Users pay each other through a mutual third party, without requiring any trust in this third party. While the Bitfury software team only made one transaction on this channel as well, it could, once again, have made thousands back and forth between all three parties, at no extra cost.\nSince Bitfury\u2019s test took place on the main net, the funding and settlement transactions are recorded on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain and can be seen by any typical block explorer.\nTests and SegWit\nBitfury\u2019s is not the first successful test of the Lightning Network. Several companies, including Lightning Labs, Blockstream, ACINQ as well as Bitfury itself have experimented with their implementations of the technology. But since most of these companies are working on versions of Lightning that rely on Segregated Witness, these tests were limited to Bitcoin\u2019s testnet and Litecoin. Likewise, major wallet service Blockchain has sent \u201cThunder\u201d transactions over Bitcoin\u2019s main net. But while Thunder resembles the Lightning protocol, it isn\u2019t quite as trustless or decentralized.\nAs such, Bitfury is the first company to get a version of the Lightning Network up and running on the current Bitcoin protocol.\n\u201cWe released this first experimental version of the Lightning Network for Bitcoin because we think the Lightning Network is an essential technology for Bitcoin and would love to see it made available as soon as possible,\u201d Vavilov said. \u201cWe are proud that our developers found a way to adopt the Lightning Network for Bitcoin without SegWit. It\u2019s a huge step forward for Bitcoin scalability.\u201d\nRegardless, the CEO noted that he is hopeful that SegWit will activate on the Bitcoin network. With BIP91 currently getting close to its activation threshold, it seems increasingly likely that SegWit could be live within a month. This would allow for a version of the Lightning Network that offers an improved user experience.\nVavilov:\n\u201cThe Lightning Network will be the most effective when used with SegWit, which is why we are fully committed to SegWit\u2019s implementation, and we will continue working on a version of the Lightning Network that is compatible with SegWit.\u201d \u00a0\nBitfury, which started out as a Bitcoin miner, has grown to become one of the largest private infrastructure providers in the Blockchain ecosystem. Part of this effort, the company has been supporting the development and implementation of the Lightning Network for well over a year. Bitfury previously also co-designed and successfully tested Flare, a payment-routing solution for the Lightning Network.\nWatch the video of Bitfury\u2019s tests here:\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 20}

Here\u2019s What That Means (and What It Does Not)", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bip-91-has-activated-heres-what-means-and-what-it-does-not/", "birthday": "Jul 20, 2017  9:18 PM EST", "date": "2017-07-21 02:18:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIt looks as if Bitcoin is getting Segregated Witness.\nBitcoin Improvement Proposal 91 (BIP 91) just locked in. Up to 90 percent of all hash power signaled support for this soft fork, which implies miners intend, in turn, to trigger Segregated Witness (SegWit) activation. By extension, this should make BIP 148 obsolete and August 1 a non-event.\nBut SegWit is not certain. In fact, on a technical level, SegWit is not any closer to activation at all.\nBIP 91\nSegregated Witness, defined by BIP 141, locks in if at least 95 percent of miners (by hash power) signal support for the upgrade within a two-week difficulty period. To do so, miners need to embed a piece of data called \u201cbit 1\u201d in the blocks they mine.\nImportantly, this is technically the only way for SegWit to activate right now. And this threshold has not yet been met.\nBut there are alternative strategies to try and trigger this threshold \u201cindirectly\u201d \u2014 like BIP 91.\nBIP 91 is a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal proposed by Bitmain Warranty engineer James Hilliard. It is compatible with the New York Agreement and backed by a number of Bitcoin companies and mining pools. It is also compatible with BIP 148, another strategy to trigger the BIP 141 threshold indirectly.\nMiners have been signaling support for BIP 91 over the past couple of days through another piece of data, \u201cbit 4.\u201d Once 269 blocks within a 336-block window included bit 4, this BIP 91 soft fork locks in. This threshold was just met.\nThis means that after another 336 blocks, a little over two days from now, all BIP 91\u2013compatible nodes will reject any block that doesn\u2019t include bit 1.\nAs long as a majority of hash power enforces BIP 91, this majority should eventually control the longest valid chain according to all Bitcoin nodes. And as this chain consists of bit 1 SegWit-signaling blocks only, it would in turn lock in SegWit on all SegWit-ready nodes\u00a0by mid-August. SegWit itself should then be live on the Bitcoin network after a two-week \u201cgrace period\u201d by the end of that month.\nIf all goes well \u2026\nWhat Could Go Wrong?\nAlthough well over 80 percent of hash power has signaled bit 4 for BIP 91 lock in, this doesn\u2019t actually guarantee anything. Most importantly, it doesn\u2019t in itself mean that these miners will signal bit 1 for SegWit.\nIndeed, so far, most miners don\u2019t. Currently, the proportion of miners signaling bit 1 is still far lower than BIP 91 activation would suggest. It is even lower than 50 percent. \nMoreover, BIP 91 will probably be enforced by hardly any economically relevant nodes; that is, nodes operated by users that accept bitcoins as payment. Almost no Bitcoin users on the network recognize BIP 91 or its bit 4 signaling at all, and will therefore continue to accept blocks with or without bit 1.\nBIP 91 will, instead, be enforced by hash power alone. This in turn means that a majority of miners (by hash power) could back out of BIP 91 with little more than reputational damage. They could continue to mine blocks that do not signal bit 1, even after BIP 91 activates in a few days. As long as these miners are in a majority, they will still control the longest valid chain: valid according to most miners, and valid to most users.\nFurthermore, any minority of miners and the few nodes that do enforce the BIP 91 soft fork would then be forked off the Bitcoin network. In a few days from now, these miners would mine (on top of) blocks that almost only they themselves would care for, while most of the rest of the entire Bitcoin network would completely ignore them.\nWith this week\u2019s bit 4 signaling, a majority of miners have effectively made a statement that they intend to start to activate the SegWit soft fork within a couple of days. But for now, that\u2019s really all it is: a very public, blockchain-based statement of intent.Actual SegWit activation should start next week, if miners stick to their stated intent.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 21}

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nAfter darknet market AlphaBay went offline on July 4, many of its users migrated to Hansa Market \u2014 and played right into the hands of an \u201cOperation Bayonet,\u201d a coordinated international law enforcement action. Today, both the U.S. Department of Justice and the Europol published press releases stating that Hansa Market has also been shut down.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, the action was led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), with law enforcement authorities in Thailand, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and the Europol participating in the operation. Bayonet\u2019s focus was takedown of both Hansa Market and AlphaBay in the course of the same multi-agency investigation.\n\u201cThis is an outstanding success by authorities in Europe and the U.S. The capability of drug traffickers and other serious criminals around the world has taken a serious hit today after a highly sophisticated joint action in multiple countries. By acting together on a global basis the law enforcement community has sent a clear message that we have the means to identify criminality and strike back, even in areas of the Dark Web. There are more of these operations to come,\u201d Rob Wainwright, the executive director of Europol, said today at a joint press conference with the U.S. Attorney General, the acting FBI director and the deputy director of the DEA in Washington, D.C.\nAccording to Europol\u2019s press release, the European agency provided Dutch authorities with an investigation lead on the Hansa Market in 2016. Europol allegedly acquired the information with the help of Bitdefender, an internet security company advising Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). Investigators managed to locate the infrastructure of the darknet marketplace in the Netherlands, which resulted in the arrest of two administrators of the site in Germany. Hansa\u2019s servers were seized in the Netherlands, Germany and Lithuania.\nFurthermore, Dutch law enforcement acquired information on \u201chigh value targets and delivery addresses for a large number of orders.\u201d With the help of Europol, the Dutch National Police collected information on approximately 10,000 foreign addresses of Hansa Market customers. In a covert action, Dutch law enforcement took control of Hansa a month ago, allowing investigators to monitor and gain information on the users of the marketplace without their knowledge. \nCasting a Wider Net\nIt seems authorities planned their actions carefully since Hansa was already under their control when AlphaBay went offline on July 4. Europol stated that the Dutch National Police \u201ccould identify and disrupt the regular criminal activity on Hansa but then also sweep up all those new users displaced from AlphaBay who were looking for a new trading platform.\u201d\n\u201cThe Dutch National Police have located Hansa Market and taken over control of this marketplace since June 20, 2017. We have modified the source code, which allowed us to capture passwords, PGP-encrypted order information, IP-Addresses, Bitcoins and other relevant information that may help law enforcement agencies worldwide to identify users of this marketplace. For more information about this operation, please consult our hidden service at http://politiepcvh42eav.onion,\u201d Dutch authorities wrote on the seized Hansa website.\nIn total, 38,000 transactions were identified by Europol, who then alerted other agencies in 600 cases. Furthermore, Europol stated they have prepared \u201cintelligence packages\u201d to be sent out to \u201claw enforcement partners across 37 countries, spawning many follow-up investigations across Europe and beyond.\u201d\nAlphaBay went offline on July 4. At the time, many users suspected it was an exit scam. Authorities announced the arrest of the Alexandre Cazes, 26, the alleged administrator of the website, who was later found dead in his cell in Thailand. On the day of Cazes\u2019s arrest, law enforcement took down servers of the dark web marketplace in Canada, the Netherlands and Thailand.\nDarknet marketplaces have generated massive police heat after dangerous synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl \u2014 the substance at the heart of drug epidemics in multiple countries, including Canada and the United States \u2014 were constantly offered for sale on the websites. The statements of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions during the joint press release in Washington, D.C., confirm this assumption.\n\u201cAmong other challenges, our great country is currently in the midst of the deadliest drug crisis in our history. One American now dies of a drug overdose every 11 minutes and more than 2 million Americans are addicted to prescription painkillers. Every day, as a result of drug abuse, American families are being bankrupted, friendships broken and promising lives cut short,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAs of earlier this year, 122 vendors advertised fentanyl and 238 advertised heroin, and we know of several Americans who were killed by drugs sold on AlphaBay.\u201d\nSessions asserted that his department\u2019s work is not yet finished and issued a warning to people still ready to engage in illegal activity on the dark web. \u201cWe will continue to find, arrest, prosecute, convict and incarcerate criminals, drug traffickers and their enablers, wherever they are.

{"title": "Op Ed: No Governance for Old Men: Coordinating Protocol Upgrades in the Future", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-no-governance-old-men-coordinating-protocol-upgrades-future/", "birthday": "Jul 21, 2017 8:32 AM EST", "date": "2017-07-21 13:32:00", "content": "Make no mistake. We are witnessing a high-stakes protocol standards battle play out in real time. And it is just as important as last century\u2019s battle for the internet\u2019s TCP standard.\u00a0\nCurrent capacity constraints on the Bitcoin blockchain have brought us to this impasse.\nThe Bitcoin protocol, as the dominant value transfer \u201cnetwork effect\u201d leader, battles against upstart cryptocurrency protocols like Ethereum and Monero. But it also battles with itself as divergent forces push for either on-chain scaling or off-chain scaling,\u00a0hard fork or soft fork, SegWit transaction format or original transaction format.\nThe so-called nuclear option is a prolonged, contested hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain because it risks splitting the network into two competing chains, which is to no one\u2019s benefit. Therefore, it should be reserved as a planned formality or a last resort for extreme situations rather than a perpetual form of \u201clive\u201d dispute resolution.\nWith so much individual and institutional wealth essentially stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, it can be extremely disconcerting when others try to \u201cfork\u201d around with your money. Chronic forking is not synonymous with wealth management and prudent capital accumulation, which require stability and predictability. Importantly, smart contracts and non-monetary applications will also rely upon relative stability since the same native digital token also facilitates the proof-of-work security model.\nThis article will examine how open-source governance was designed to work within the Bitcoin protocol and how users, miners and developers are locked in a symbiotic dance when it comes to potential forks to the immutable consensus. Solutions will be proposed and analyzed that maintain the decentralized nature of the resulting code and the blockchain consensus, while still permitting sensible protocol upgrades. Governance is not only about the particular method of change-control management, but also about how the very method itself is subject to change.\nLet\u2019s not deploy the nuclear option for every protocol\u00a0upgrade.\nOpen-Source Protocols and\u00a0Bitcoin\nGenerally referred to as FOSS, or free and open-source software, this source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to use the software and to voluntarily improve its design, resulting in decreasing software costs; increasing security and stability, and flexibility over hardware choice; and better privacy protection.\nOpen-source governance models, such as Linux and BitTorrent, are not new and they existed prior to the emergence of Bitcoin in early 2009; however, they have never before been so tightly intertwined with\u00a0money\u00a0itself. Indeed, as the largest distributed computing project in the world with self-adjusting computational power, Bitcoin may be the first crude instance of A.I. on the internet.\nIn\u00a0\u201cWho Controls the Blockchain?\u201d Patrick Murck confirms that Bitcoin is functioning as designed:\nAs a blockchain community grows, it becomes increasingly more difficult for stakeholders to reach a consensus on changing network rules. This is by design, and reinforces the original principles of the blockchain\u2019s creators. To change the rules is to split the network, creating a new blockchain and a new community. Blockchain networks resist political governance because they are governed by everyone who [participates] in them, and by no one in particular.\nMurck continues:\n\nBitcoin\u2019s ability to resist such populist campaigns demonstrates the success of the blockchain\u2019s governance structure and shows that the \u2018governance crisis\u2019 is a false narrative.\n\nOf course it\u2019s a false narrative, and Murck is correct on this point. Bitcoin\u2019s lack of political governance\u00a0is\u00a0Bitcoin\u2019s governance model, and forking is a natural intended component of that. \u201cGovernance\u201d may be the wrong word for it because we are actually talking about minimizing potential disruption.\nWhere Bitcoin differs from other open-source protocols is that two levels of forking exist. One level forks the open-source code (code fork), and another level forks the blockchain consensus (chain fork). Since there can only be one consensus per native digital token, chain splits are the natural result of this. The only way to avoid potential chain splits in the future is to restrict the change-control process to a single implementation, which is not very safe nor realistic.\n\u201cCollaborate or fork\u201d has become the rallying cry for Bitcoin Core supporters. L.M. Goodman, author of\u00a0\u201cTezos: A Self-Amending Crypto-Ledger Position Paper,\u201d\u00a0writes:\n\nCore development teams are a potentially dangerous source of centralization.\n\nWhen it comes to\u00a0Bitcoin Core, the publicly shared code repository hosts the current reference implementation, and a small group of code committers (or maintainers) regulate any merges to the code. Even though other projects may be more open to criticism and newcomers, this general structure reminds me of a presiding council of elders.\nMaking hazy claims of a peer-review process or saying that committers are just passive maintainers merely creates the facade of decentralized code. The real peer-review process takes place on multiple community and technical forums, some of which are not even frequented by the developers and Bitcoin Core committers.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0BIP\u00a0(Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) process is sufficient and it\u2019s working for those who choose to collaborate on Bitcoin Core. Similar to the RFC (Request for Comments)\u00a0process\u00a0at the IETF, BIP debates about a proposed implementation can provide technical documentation useful to developers. However, it is not working for many involved in Bitcoin protocol development due to the advantages of incumbency and the false appeal to authority with core developers. If Bitcoin Core no longer maintains the leading reference implementation for the Bitcoin protocol, it will be 100 percent due to this intransigence.\nSensitive to the criticisms of glorifying Bitcoin Core, Adam Back of Blockstream recently proposed an option to\u00a0freeze the base-layer protocol, but at the moment that will only move all of the politics and game-playing to\u00a0what\u00a0exactly the base-layer freeze should look like. It is a nice idea for separating the protocol standard from a single reference implementation and for transitioning the Bitcoin protocol to an IETF-like structure, although it\u2019s extremely premature for now.\u00a0\nTherefore, by default, that leaves us with several alternative Bitcoin implementations in an environment of continual forking.\nEven Satoshi Nakamoto was\u00a0critical\u00a0of multiple consensus implementations in 2010:\n\nI don\u2019t believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea. So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.\n\nThat prevailing standpoint, however, may be changing, which Aaron van Wirdum addresses in\u00a0\u201cThe Long History and Disputed Desirability of Alternative Bitcoin Implementations.\u201d\u00a0Wirdum cites Eric Voskuil of libbitcoin, who argues that there should not be one particular implementation to define the Bitcoin protocol:\n\n\u201cAll code that impacts consensus is part of consensus,\u201d Voskuil told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBut when part of this code stops the network or does something not nice, it\u2019s called a bug needing a fix, but that fix is a change to consensus. Since bugs are consensus, fixes are forks. As such, a single implementation gives far too much power to its developers. Shutting down the network while some star chamber works out a new consensus is downright authoritarian.\u201d\n\nMultiple alternative implementations of the Bitcoin protocol strengthen the network and help to prevent code centralization.\nPolitics of Blockchain Forking (or How UASF BIP 148 Will\u00a0Fail)\nContentious hard forks and soft forks all come down to hashing power. You can phrase it differently and you can make believe that two-day zero-balance nodes have a fundamental say in the outcome, but you cannot alter that basic reality.\nA\u00a0BIP 148\u00a0fork will undoubtedly need mining hash power to succeed or even to result in a minority chain. However, if Segregated Witness (SegWit) had sufficient miner support in the first place, the BIP 148 UASF itself would be unnecessary. So, in that respect, it will now proceed like a game of chicken waiting to see if miners support the fork attempt.\nMirroring aspects of mob rule, if the UASF approach works as a way to bring miners around to adopting SegWit, then the emboldened mob will deploy the tactic for numerous other protocol upgrades in the future. Consensus rules should not be easy to change and they should not be able to change through simple majority rule on nodes, economic or not. Eventually, these attempts will run headfirst into the wall of\u00a0Nakamoto consensus.\u00a0\nAs far as the network is concerned, it\u2019s like turning off the power to your node.\nThere is no room for majority rule in Bitcoin. Those who endorse the UASF approach and cleverly insert UASF tags in their social media handles are endorsing majority rule in Bitcoin. They are providing a stage for any random user group to push their warped agenda via tyranny of the nodes.\nThe prolific\u00a0Jimmy Song\u00a0says that having real skin in the game is what matters:\n\nBitcoin doesn\u2019t care if you post arguments on Reddit. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t care if you put something clever in your Twitter name. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t care if you educate people, write articles, or make clever Twitter insults. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t care about your wishes, your feelings or your arguments.\n\nLet\u2019s keep \u201cmajority rule\u201d antics out of Bitcoin. There is no protocol condition that activates \u201cif we are all united\u201d and that is a good thing.\nWith enough hashing power, the mob-induced UASF BIP 148 will lead to a temporary chain split. However, the probability of a Bitcoin minority chain surviving for very long is extremely low due to the lengthy difficulty re-targeting period of 2,016 blocks. Unlike the Ethereum/Ethereum Classic fork, that is a long time for miners to invest in a chain of uncertainty.\nResponding to a Reddit post for newbies who are scared of losing money around the 1st of August due to UASF,\u00a0ArmchairCryptologist\u00a0explains:\n\nYour advice is sound, but realistically, the most likely scenario is that the UASF either wins or dies. If it gets less than ~12% of the hashrate, it will not be able to activate Segwit in time, and it will almost certainly die. If it gets less than ~20% I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see active interference with orphaning to prevent transactions from being processed.\n\n\nIf on the other hand it gets more than ~40% of the hashrate, the chance for a reorg on the other chain is large enough that most miners will likely jump ship, and it will almost certainly win. At over ~20% block orphaning attacks won\u2019t be effective, as it would split the majority chain hashrate and risk tipping the scale. Which means that the only situation where you will realistically have two working chains for an extended period is if you get between ~20% and ~40% of the hashrate for the UASF.\n\nThe collectivist UASF BIP 148 strategy will ultimately fail and that\u2019s a good thing. It is driven primarily by those with very little at stake expecting the miners to stake everything by supporting a minority chain. Pretty soon, you run out of other people\u2019s money. This commenter on\u00a0Reddit\u00a0understands:\n\nThe entire premise was that it was very cheap to switch, but very expensive to stay. That\u2019s when I realized the folly of it all; [it\u2019s] only cheap because they\u2019re not staking anything. But someone has to stake something.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what is going to cause it to fail. That and the lack of replay protection. People like this guy flip it\u00a0around and genuinely believe the mining problem\u00a0will be solved by massively increased value. If they do somehow put enough pressure on exchanges that list UASF, despite the lack of replay protection, and if we take his logic a step further, UASFers are going to be pushing everyone to \u201cbuy, buy, buy\u201d UASF and \u201csell, sell, sell\u201d Legacy Coin. But without replay protection, they\u2019re going to be obliterated by a few smart people who realize there are huge gains to be had.\nAlphonse Pace has an excellent\u00a0paper\u00a0describing chain splits and their resolution. He walks us through compatible, incompatible and semi-compatible hard forks, arguing that users do have power if they truly reject a soft-fork rule change:\n\n\u2026 users do have power\u200a\u2014\u200aby invoking an incompatible hard fork. In this case, users will force the chain to split by introducing a new ruleset (which may include a proof-of-work change, but does not require one). This ensures users always have an escape from a miner-imposed ruleset that they reject. This way, if the economy and users truly reject a soft fork rule change, they always have the power to break away and reclaim the rules they wish. It may be inconvenient, but the same is true by any attack by the miners on users.\n\nThe Future of Coordinating Protocol\u00a0Upgrades\nWhat group determines the big decisions in Bitcoin\u2019s direction?\u00a0Ilogy\u00a0doubts that it is the developers:\nTheymos almost completely foresaw what is happening today. Why? Because Theymos has a deep understanding of Bitcoin and he was able to connect the dots and recognize that the logic of the system leads inevitably to this conclusion. Once we add to the equation the fact that restricting on-chain scaling was always going to be perceived by the \u2018generators\u2019 as something that \u2018reduces profit,\u2019 it should be clear that the logic of the system was intrinsically going to bring us to the point we find ourselves today.\n\nYears later these two juggernauts of Bitcoin would find themselves on opposite ends of the debate. But what is interesting, what they both recognized, was that ultimately big decisions in Bitcoin\u2019s direction would be determined by the powerful actors in the space, not by the average user and, more importantly, not by the developers.\u00a0\nThe developer role can be thought of as proposing a variety of software menu choices for the users, merchants and miners to accept and run. If a software upgrade or patch is deemed unacceptable, then developers must go back to work and adjust the BIP menu offering. Otherwise, mutiny becomes the only option for dissatisfied miners.\u00a0\nIn\u00a0\u201cWho Controls Bitcoin?\u201d\u00a0Daniel Krawisz says that the investors wield the most power, and because of that, miners follow investors. Therefore, the protocol upgrades likely to get adopted will be the ones that increase Bitcoin\u2019s value\u00a0as an investment, such as anonymity improvements being favored over attempts at making Bitcoin easier to regulate.\nIn the future, miner coordination via a Bitcoin DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) on the blockchain could be the key to smooth and uneventful forking. Self-governing ratification would allow diverse stakeholders to coordinate protocol upgrades on-chain, reducing the likelihood of software propagation battles that perpetually fork the codebase. \nAttorney\u00a0Adam Vaziri\u00a0of Diacle supports a system of DAO voting by Bitcoin miners to remove the uncertainty around protocol upgrades. He readily admits that he has been inspired by\u00a0Tezos\u00a0and\u00a0Decred.\nPrediction markets have also been proposed as a method to gauge user and miner preferences through public forecasting, the theory being that these prediction markets would yield the fairest overall consensus for protocol upgrades prior to the actual fork.\nThe question remains: Is coin-based voting based on allocated hash power superior to the informal signaling method utilized today? Are prediction markets or futures markets a viable method to gauge consensus and determine critical protocol upgrades?\nI\u2019m not optimistic. On-chain voting and \u201cintent\u201d signaling are both non-binding expressions while prediction and futures markets can be easily gamed. Therefore, while Tezos and Decred represent admirable efforts in the quest for complete resilient decentralization, I do not think Bitcoin protocol upgrades of the future will be managed in this way.\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem doesn\u2019t need to achieve a\u00a0social consensus\u00a0prior to making changes to the protocol. What has clearly emerged from the events of this summer is that Bitcoin has demonstrated an even stronger degree of immutability.\n\n\nBitcoin has shown every indication that it wants a degree of immutability beyond what any of us expected. Btw Bitcoin is an AI, not a mkt https://t.co/OcQ9ID3aL6\u2014 Pierre Rochard (@pierre_rochard) July 16, 2017\n\n\n\nThere is no failure of governance and there is no failure of the market. The non-authoritarian forces at play here are functioning exactly as they should. Protocol upgrades in a decentralized environment are an evolutionary process, and that\u00a0process\u00a0has matured to the current\u00a0six stages\u00a0of Bitcoin protocol upgrading, with some optional variances for\u00a0BIP 91:\n(a)\u00a0BIP menu choices\u00a0competing for mindshare, strategic appropriateness and technical rigor;\n(b)\u00a0Informal intent signaling\u00a0based on miners inserting text into the coinbase for each block mined;\n(c)\u00a0Block signaling period\u00a0where miners formally signal a designated \u201cbit\u201d trigger for BIP lock-in, based on \u201cx\u201d percent over a \u201cy\u201d number of blocks period;\n(d)\u00a0Block activation period\u00a0after BIP lock-in, which sets a secondary period of \u201cx\u201d percent over a \u201cy\u201d number of blocks for activation;\n(e)\u00a0Primary difficulty adjustment period\u00a0(2,016 blocks) where \u201cx\u201d percent of miners must signal for the upgrade to lock in;\n(f)\u00a0Secondary difficulty adjustment period\u00a0(2,016 blocks) required for the protocol upgrade to activate on the network.\nConclusion\nThis would not be the first fork in Bitcoin and it won\u2019t be the last. If we believe in the power of\u00a0Nakamoto consensus\u00a0and probabilistic security, then the secret to uneventful protocol upgrades is smoother and more reliable signaling by miners.\nJuly has been a tough month for Bitcoin, but it has also been pivotal.

Shortly after reaching a local high in the mid $2,900s, it immediately retraced down to the mid $2,700s where, at the time of this article, it is currently sitting. Is this price growth sustainable? Is there more bull left in this rally? I\u2019ll attempt to break down this recent market move from both sides of the fence and show why investors should or shouldn\u2019t be wary of a move of this magnitude. \u00a0\nFull disclosure: This analysis will not attempt to speculate on the value implications within this ongoing scaling debate. This will be an objective, raw analysis of the data at hand.\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 12-hr Candles, Bitfinex, Macro Bull Run\nIf we put this entire bull run into perspective, we see that upon the completion of the Head and Shoulders Reversal Pattern, the market retraced down to the 50 percent Fibonacci Retracement values before ultimately bouncing and immediately climbing toward the previous all-time high.\nAt the moment, BTC-USD has yet to see any significant pullback from its latest move to justify any semblance of considerably strong support. The importance of establishing support levels is crucial for a sustained, healthy bull run. A support level sends out a signal to investors that basically says, \u201cHey, the market is not likely to drop below \u2018x\u2019 value \u2014 your risk is lowered by buying at \u2018y\u2019 price.\u201d \u00a0\nHowever, without these firm support levels, investors don\u2019t know where the price currently stands in the grand scheme of the market. Thus, uncertainty can be injected into the market even in times of strong bull rallies. This uncertainty often leads to early profit taking, panic selling and long-position capitulation (also known as a \u201clong squeeze\u201d).\nTo play devil\u2019s advocate, one can make an argument for a bullish continuation of yesterday\u2019s massive bull run:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 30-min Candles, Bitfinex, Price Consolidation\nIf we take the current trend out of the context of the entire market, it would appear to display characteristics of a bullish continuation pattern known as a \u201cBull Pennant.\u201d Bull Pennants are characterized by having lower highs, higher lows and decreasing volume along the length of the pennant. A pennant of this magnitude would have a price target somewhere around $3,400. (For the sake of time, I won\u2019t explain why that\u2019s the price target. You\u2019ll just have to take my word for it.) \u00a0\nHowever, when we put the Bull Pennant into the context of the entire market, we see signs of market divergence starting to form on the higher timescales:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 4-hr Candles, Bitfinex, Bearish Divergence\nOn the 4-hr MACD, we see bearish divergence during the market move to $2,900. Divergence is an indication that the market has begun to lose momentum and is likely to pull back before any more uptrending will continue. \u00a0\nIn regard to a bullish continuation of this rally, something to keep an eye out for are the tests of the key Fibonacci Retracement values shown in Figure 1. A retest and strong rejection of the Fibonacci lines will show strong market confidence in the eyes of investors who are currently sitting on the sidelines. Before any sustained, healthy uptrend resumes, the market will have to prove itself at the lower values to establish firm support.\nDuring massive rallies it\u2019s important to always keep in mind that large price movements often come with a large cost. It is still unclear what the immediate future of BTC-USD will be, but it\u2019s important to remain levelheaded when entering trades and always look at the market objectively. \u00a0\nSummary:\nOver three days, the BTC-USD market gained 60 percent in value.No firm support has been established to justify remaining at this price level.Because there is no firm support, volume is beginning to taper off while the market decides the next direction to head to next.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Colony essentially brings the organization and human capital together onto a decentralized and transparent platform, and adds a monetary system that rewards freelancers and contributors alike based on their contributions to the success of the organization.\n\u201cColony brings about a new \u2018Nature of the Firm\u2019 by significantly reducing both the transaction costs of the market exchange mechanism for labor, and trust required for people to work together,\u201d Jack du Rose, co-founder of Colony, told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cWe see Colony as infrastructure for the organizations of the future. We believe infrastructure should be reliable and impartial; one organization should not be reliant on the existence or permission of another to operate.\u201d \nInstead of being managed by fallible individuals, \u201ccolonies\u201d running on the platform harness the wisdom of the crowd to make sure that things get done by the right people and at the right time. \nEach colony has its own token that represents a share of the ownership of the organization. Smart contracts are programmed to distribute ownership tokens according to the value each individual contributes. Contributors can later trade their tokens on the open market for cash. \nColony also comes with a reputation system that allows people to review and grade others\u2019 contributed work. This system allows companies to choose the best candidates while enabling freelancers and experts to build influence and demonstrate their skills.\nColony: The \u201cPeople Layer for the Decentralized Protocol Stack\u201d \nWhile Colony is building a reference client for its platform, the team very much thinks of the Colony protocol as infrastructure upon which other developers will build applications.\nThe Colony protocol, which is built as open-source smart contracts on the Ethereum network, is designed to enable developers to integrate decentralized and self-regulating division of labor, decision-making and financial management into their applications. \nDu Rose described it as \u201cthe people layer for the decentralized protocol stack\u201d and said he expects many companies and products to be built based on the software.\nIn the future, he hopes to see the protocol being integrated into a variety of applications. It can be used, for instance, to form the basis of a decentralized ride-sharing service, to handle claims in an insurance decentralized app or to provide the framework by which a merchants' guild coordinates in a virtual world, he said.\nMoving forward \nColony released its beta in February of this year. The Colony Beta allows teams to create their own \u201ccollaboration network\u201d and combines task management with payments and tracking features.\nThese features include a Kanban-style task flow and board management system with cryptocurrency-enabled task bounties, although for now the beta is on a test network and cannot issue Ether or other main-net cryptocurrencies.\nDu Rose said that the team\u2019s immediate focus is to continue to build out the network and client library, and \u201cget them in the hands of as many people as possible.\u201d\nHe said that an ongoing part of Colony\u2019s medium- and long-term goals is focused on polishing the platform and improving the software in order to increase blockchain adoption, \u201cnot just for developers building on top of the Colony Protocol, but for the Ethereum developer community as a whole.\u201d \nHe continued, \u201cWe see many challenges to usability in [the] blockchain space, and we don\u2019t believe we\u2019re going to achieve mainstream adoption of blockchain technology until we are able to offer the same quality of experience as centralized services provide.\u201d \nCompanies and organizations around the world are beginning to explore the use of blockchain technology in project management. Russian government\u2013owned development bank Vnesheconombank (VEB) is reportedly looking to launch a prototype for such a platform. \nSpeaking to Sputnik at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in May, the bank's chairman, Sergey Gorkov, said:\n\u201cWhen we started to think about how to manage projects efficiently, we realized that there is no platform. Everything that we had became obsolete. We realized that the blockchain is a good fundamental and qualitative platform for the future.

After editions in Montreal, Hong Kong and Milan, Stanford University will host the fourth edition of the Scaling Bitcoin Workshops on the 4th and 5th of November of this year.\n\u201cWe want to aid the technical consensus-building process, in a domain where performance and security are crucial trade-offs,\u201d Ferdinando M. Ametrano, a Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology professor at Politecnico di Milano and Scaling Bitcoin Planning Committee member, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nBorn out of the early days of Bitcoin\u2019s very public scaling debate, the first two Scaling Bitcoin conferences or \u201cworkshops\u201d were organized shortly after one another in Montreal and Hong Kong in the second half of 2015. It was here that many developers actually met face to face for the first time, and the workshops resulted in the well-known scaling roadmap supported by the Bitcoin Core development team.\nA third edition of Scaling Bitcoin was organised in Milan in October 2016. That time around, the workshops increased in scope from scaling-only to also include privacy and fungibility improvements, as well as broader technical development.\nThis line will be continued in Stanford, where the theme of the event has been dubbed \u201cScaling the Edge.\u201d While the exact agenda is yet to be established by a dedicated committee, overlapping topics for the Stanford edition should once again include fungibility, and there should also be increased focus on simulations and tests.\nPlus, as a relatively new topic of interest, Scaling Bitcoin Stanford will expand its scope once again: this time to also include game theory and governance of the technology.\n\u201cThis has never gotten much of the spotlight at previous editions of Scaling Bitcoin. But recent events like BIP148, BIP91, user activated soft forks are proving that we are learning more and discovering how Bitcoin\u2019s economic incentives are aligned,\u201d Ametrano said. \u201cMoving forward, we\u2019d like to discuss what might be the process for protocol evolution.\u201d\nNotably, with the event taking place in early November, it looks like Scaling Bitcoin Stanford will once again take place against the backdrop of a looming contentious hard fork. Where the first two events were a direct response to Bitcoin XT and its hard fork proposal, BTC1 is scheduled to hard fork an increase in Bitcoin\u2019s block weight limit by late November.\nIt, therefore, seems likely that this potential hard fork will be part of the discussion in Stanford in one way or another, Ametrano acknowledged.\n\u201cBlock size proposals are included as topics of interest for Stanford. And of course a potential hard fork will be, implicitly or explicitly, part of the conference debate,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking ahead, many \u2014 probably most \u2014 agree some on-chain scaling will have to happen. But how and when requires unanimous agreement. Which brings us back to the topic of game theory and governance.\u201d\nScaling Bitcoin is currently accepting technical proposals for improving Bitcoin performance including designs, experimental results and comparisons against other proposals.

It should be noted that price consolidation can take many patterns and is not restricted to the convergent pattern (lower highs accompanied by higher lows) displayed above. For the sake of this article, we will focus on the convergent pattern displayed in our current market. To see the health of the overall market, let\u2019s put this trend in the context of the weeks leading up to this pattern:\nFigure 2: ETH-USD, 6-hr Candles, Bitfinex, Macro Fibonacci Retracement Values\nWithin the context of the macro trend, our consolidation pattern falls very neatly on the 60 percent Fibonacci Retracement values of the macro bull trend that brought us to our all-time high values. When looking at the health of this trend, the first thing that pops out is the large amount of supportive volume (shown in yellow) that has gone into shaping the current ETH-USD volume. The current volume trend far outweighs any of the previous volume trends throughout the life of the bear market and even throughout the life of the previous bull run that led to all-time high values. \nIf we zoom out even further, we can see our current volume is actually at the highest volume the market has seen since its last major consolidation period within the $40 values:\nFigure 3: ETH-USD, 1-Day Candles, Log Scale, Bitfinex, Last Major Consolidation Period\nThe previous consolidation period (shown in yellow) resulted in a substantial Bull Pennant pattern that resulted in a bull run that doubled the market value of ETH-USD. Something interesting to note is our current consolidation pattern within the context of the entire market since the last consolidation pattern. If we look at the market moves post-consolidation as a massive bull run \u2014 which, technically, it is \u2014 we see ETH-USD is consolidating very nicely on the 50 percent Fibonacci Retracement values. \nAlthough the price projections for our current consolidation period is substantially lower than the last major consolidation period, the important aspect to take away from Figure 3 is the magnitude of the volume the market has experienced over the past couple weeks. High volume leading into a consolidation period is a good sign that the market has found its bottom and is now gathering up support and investor confidence before a breakout.\nThere are two ways to view our current consolidation pattern:\nAn agnostic (meaning it\u2019s neither bullish-leaning nor bearish-leaning), symmetrical triangle;A Bull Pennant (a bullish continuation pattern).\nFor the sake of time, I won\u2019t go into details regarding how to calculate the price targets of these patterns. Both symmetrical triangles and Bull Pennants are very commonly traded patterns and have a lot of literature to support their price targets. If this pattern turns out to be a symmetrical triangle and the consolidation breaks down, we can most likely expect a move down to the $180 range before any further upward movement is seen. \nHowever, if this is a Bull Pennant, ETH-USD can most likely expect a ~$100 move upward, leading to a price target of approximately $330. It\u2019s important to note that a price target of $330 would result in a 100 percent retracement since the beginning of our prior bear run. If the market breaks upward and we do see a $330 price target, a test of this 100 percent retracement value will be crucial to determine the future moves within the ETH-USD markets.\nSummary:\n\nETH-USD has spent days consolidating along $230.A breakout upward would most likely yield a $330 price target.A breakout downward would most likely yield a $180 price target.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nTumbleBit is one of the most promising privacy-enhancing technologies being built on top of Bitcoin right now. It allows users to mix their coins fully anonymously, without requiring trust in any third party. An advanced version of the technology, which requires Segregated Witness, can even be utilized as a second-layer payment hub to reduce transaction costs and speed up confirmation times.\nAfter TumbleBit was first proposed in an academic paper and subsequently presented at the Scaling Bitcoin workshops in Milan, NBitcoin lead developer Nicolas Dorier built an early version of the technology. Since then, two wallets are being developed to make TumbleBit accessible for everyday use: Breeze and, more recently, HiddenWallet.\nHiddenWallet developer \u00c1d\u00e1m Fics\u00f3r, better known online as \u201cnopara73,\u201d also completed Tor integration this week.\nI estimate that TumbleBit will be usable for the general public within a month or two.\u00a0\u2014\u00c1d\u00e1m Fics\u00f3r\nTor Integration\nTumbleBit lets users connect to a central server, which in turn allows them to establish payment channels that send coins back and forth in such a way that everyone receives as many coins as they sent. Multiple users can engage at the same time, which allows them to mix their coins, breaking the trail of ownership on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\nThe key innovation compared to previous mixing models is that TumbleBit uses a combination of nifty cryptographic tricks to make sure that, first off, no one can steal funds. And second, no one \u2014 not even the central server \u2014 can link any of the sending addresses to any of the receiving addresses.\nWell, almost. One problem remained, as Fics\u00f3r explained: \n\u201cUsers connect to the central server with their own IP address to provide their sending and receiving addresses,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this means that the central server could still match sending and receiving addresses based on the IP address that provided them. If one IP address provides both Bitcoin addresses, it\u2019s trivial to link them.\u201d \nThis would of course defeat the purpose of using TumbleBit in the first place.\nFics\u00f3r therefore built a Tor-integration tool for the existing TumbleBit project. With this tool, the sending and receiving addresses of any user are separately provided to the central server through the anonymity network. This removes any link from a user\u2019s IP address to any specific Bitcoin addresses and \u2014 importantly \u2014 removes the link between sending and receiving addresses as well.\nWallet Privacy\nAt the same time, Fics\u00f3r is developing a new wallet specifically designed for TumbleBit, HiddenWallet. And interestingly, this wallet would even offer increased privacy without TumbleBit.\nEssentially all lightweight wallets leak address data to the outside world in some way or another. Most web wallets, mobile wallets and some desktop wallets leak this info because they rely on a server that tells them about their balances. This server therefore needs to know all addresses in a wallet and can link them together accordingly. \nAlternatively, some SPV clients send out a type of cryptographic \u201cpuzzle\u201d (Bloom filters) to the network that requests all data relevant for their balance. But this leaks address data to random nodes on the network \u2026 and thus to analytics companies that specifically monitor the network for these puzzles. \n\u201cBlockstream\u2019s Jonas Nick claimed in 2014 that if someone were to give him one Bitcoin address, he\u2019d be able to figure out 70 percent of your wallet holdings. This was just one smart guy with limited resources, three years ago. You can imagine what well-funded analytics companies in 2017 are capable of,\u201d Fics\u00f3r noted.\nThis linking of addresses is obviously a problem for TumbleBit users. No matter how much these users mix their bitcoins across their Bitcoin addresses, if all these addresses can be linked together anyway, there\u2019s no point.\nThe only wallets that avoid this problem, so far, are full-node wallets like Bitcoin Core. These wallets download all transaction data on the network, meaning they don\u2019t need to request specific data that reveals their own addresses. However, full nodes can be a bit resource-intensive, which is a barrier to entry for many casual Bitcoin users.\nHiddenWallet\nHiddenWallet introduces a clever model in between the lightweight and full-node wallets, specifically designed to improve privacy.\nLike a full node, HiddenWallet connects directly to the Bitcoin network, where it likewise requests all transaction data from random nodes. However, where full nodes verify (and typically store) all of this data, HiddenWallet instead immediately discards any data it doesn\u2019t need. It only verifies and stores transaction data that involve the Bitcoin addresses in the wallet itself and doesn\u2019t care about the rest. This requires far fewer resources than a full node does.\n\u201cThe privacy benefit is obvious,\u201d said Fics\u00f3r. \u201cSince HiddenWallet downloads all transaction data, connected nodes have no idea which data is kept by the wallet and what is discarded. They learn nothing about the addresses in HiddenWallet and can\u2019t link any of them together.\u201d\nAnd Fics\u00f3r thinks he may be able to trim resource usage down even further in a next release of HiddenWallet. This upcoming version may cut out all transaction data that would, for analytics companies, obviously not be relevant to the wallet anyway. This includes old transaction data, but also specific types of transactions. Such a modification could potentially make HiddenWallet available even on low-bandwidth mobile connections.\nWith this progress, it looks like TumbleBit may be usable even before the end of this summer, Fics\u00f3r estimates.\n\u201cWe previously thought we might get the system up and running around this time, but it turned out there was a little bit more to it than we thought. That being said, another big hurdle is now taken: the Japanese company United Bitcoiners is running a tumbling server. Combined with Tor integration and wallets, all pieces of the puzzle are coming together.\u201d\n\u00c1d\u00e1m Fics\u00f3r works on TumbleBit without compensation, but accepts donations on 186n7me3QKajQZJnUsVsezVhVrSwyFCCZ", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 12}

One implementation of such a solution, Bitcoinocracy, already exists, while several Bitcoin Core developers have been working on alternative schemes.\nAnd recently, Bitrated CEO Nadav Ivgi developed an early implementation of HODL.voting, a coin-voting solution with an interesting twist. To vote, users need to lock up their bitcoins, losing access to them for some time.\n\u201cThe theory is that by attaching a real cost to voting \u2014 loss of liquidity and ability to sell \u2014 we can get more reliable signaling,\u201d the Israeli developer thinks.\nSacrifice\nThe concept behind existing coin-voting schemes like Bitcoinocracy is simple. Anyone who holds bitcoins can use the associated private keys to sign a message. This message acts as a vote, and all votes are added up. This definitively proves that all votes correspond to the ownership of bitcoins, allowing for a one-coin-one-vote type of system.\nBut this straightforward setup also has its weaknesses, Ivgi argues. Most important, while this type of voting requires access to bitcoins, it still doesn\u2019t actually cost anything to vote.\n\u201cThis means that custodians \u2014 exchanges, hosted wallets, etcetera \u2014 get to have disproportional voting power with their customers\u2019 funds. And I don\u2019t think that people currently holding funds at an exchange meant to consent to the exchange voting on their behalf on matters such as this,\u201d Ivgi explained. \u201cAnd two: cost-free signaling is not very reliable. Someone who\u2019s not informed on a debate has no incentive not to vote however he feels like, even if he knows that the vote is completely uneducated. Alternatively, it would be very cheap to bribe him to vote a certain way, especially if he\u2019s not planning to vote otherwise.\u201d\nThe solution to this problem, Ivgi thinks, is to add a cost to voting. Referring to the handicap principle, he suggests that whenever there\u2019s an incentive to cheat, requiring a sort of \u201csacrifice\u201d can make signaling more reliable. Anyone who wants to vote would have to incur a real cost to prove that he really means it.\nThe cost that HODL.voting imposes on voters is a lack of access to their actual bitcoins, temporarily. And the longer someone is willing to lose this access, the more weight is attributed to the vote.\n\u201cHODL.voting uses time locks as a sacrifice to assign votes with weight,\u201d Ivgi explained. \u201cYou send bitcoins to a special Bitcoin address that locks your bitcoins up and encodes your vote. The vote is weighted according to the amount of bitcoins locked, multiplied by the lock duration.\u201d\nAnd this also has the benefit, Ivgi pointed out, that custodians can\u2019t vote for their customers; not without effectively running a fractional reserve. Users may want to withdraw their bitcoins at any time, so making them inaccessible shouldn\u2019t be an option for exchanges and wallet providers.\nHODL.voting\nIvgi developed an early implementation of HODL.voting at the Tel Aviv Bitcoin Embassy Hackathon last March \u2014 and won first prize with it. \nThe implementation uses CheckSequenceVerify (CSV), a feature that was added to the Bitcoin protocol about a year ago. CSV allows users to essentially \u201clock\u201d bitcoins into the Bitcoin blockchain itself. A transaction that spends these bitcoins would be considered valid only at some point in the future, relative to when the bitcoins were \u201clocked up.\u201d\nUsing the HODL.voting website, voters can create a transaction that locks up their bitcoins with CSV. The website also generates a refund transaction, which will only be valid at some point in the future. HODL.voting users can broadcast this transaction when the time lock has passed \u2014 or have it broadcast for them. Consequently, the voter will have lost access to his coins for some time, enforced by the Bitcoin protocol itself.\nAnd the transaction that locks up the bitcoins also contains some extra data: the \u201cvote.\u201d The HODL.voting website recognizes the data as a vote, to record it and add it to all other votes to calculate the overall score. That score is then visible on the HODL.voting website itself.\nThe only real weakness left is that whoever controls the website could fuzz the visible score. While the actual vote cannot be faked \u2014 it\u2019s embedded and enforced by the Bitcoin protocol \u2014 what visitors see on the website as the result can be. That said, it should be possible for individual voters to verify whether their vote was included in the overall results. And, any interested party can verify that all the votes as displayed on the website are legitimate. This should keep the platform honest, Ivgi thinks.\nLastly, it should be noted that HODL.voting is, of course, not in any way binding for anything \u2014 it\u2019s actually more of a polling mechanism. But as a poll that cannot be faked, it could provide useful information that is otherwise hard to come by.\nIvgi:\n\u201cI think that as a voting system it\u2019s mostly interesting for gauging community sentiment regarding Bitcoin protocol development issues. It gives the voting power to long-term holders who\u2019re willing to prove that they\u2019re confident in Bitcoin\u2019s long-term value proposition and that they have a stake in Bitcoin. Not just today, but also in the future value of Bitcoin as affected by the protocol development decisions they\u2019re voting on.\u201d\nAn alpha version of HODL.voting is currently running on Bitcoin\u2019s testnet. Ivgi says there\u2019s still quite a bit of work to be done before the project will be ready for the mainnet. He will complete HODL.voting if he believes there is enough interest for it.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 10}

The Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Saint Petersburg was held in June, followed immediately by a blockchain-focused hackathon called BlockchainHack in Moscow, with 150 people in attendance competing for $100,000 worth of cryptocurrency. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe hackathon took place at the Paveletsky Art Center, a massive building in downtown Moscow that has become the de facto hub for blockchain technology in Russia, with an increasing number of blockchain developers and enthusiasts who work out of it. The event was jointly organized by BTC Media, Qtum, Zerion, Waves, the Token Fund and Blockchain School, with additional support from the community in Russia.\nThe teams presented ambitious demos with winning topics including a mobile application to track and invest into ICOs; an arbitration service based on smart contracts and a reputation system; facial recognition software to determine what ICOs and blockchain projects a blockchain developer has been involved in and is currently active with; among others. \nThe winning team, Wafer, presented a demo and vision of creating a distributed Wi-Fi network using blockchain technology. They effectively allow routers to sell traffic without being tied to a particular software on the device. It uses smart contracts to ensure that users all pay for their traffic and that a user is guaranteed to get access to the internet after payment.\nQtum was the largest sponsor of the hackathon, and with members of the Qtum Foundation in attendance, many of the developers deployed their applications to Ethereum as well as Qtum. Qtum is a hybrid blockchain that merges the UTXO transaction model of Bitcoin with the EVM on Ethereum. It began as a fork of Bitcoin and the team added in an abstraction layer to integrate the EVM, ultimately allowing any developer tool built for Ethereum to also be available on Qtum, including Solidity smart contracts and Web3. Because of this, many of the decentralized applications presented were built on Ethereum as well as deployed to the Qtum testnet.\nPrize money was awarded in Qtum tokens, Waves tokens and ether (ETH): as the grand prize winner, Wafer took home 5,000 Qtum tokens, valued at over $50,000. Qtum also awarded two other teams with 2,500 and 1,000 tokens for second and third prize. \nWaves awarded their top three picks with 500 Waves, 300 Waves and 100 Waves, respectively. The winning Waves team developed a platform that uses facial recognition software for investors to quickly determine which ICO projects a person has been involved in. \nThe winning project in the Ethereum category, as selected by Zerion, created an interface for investors to quickly invest in multiple ICOs, and was awarded 10 ETH.\nPatrick Dai, the cofounder of the Qtum project, said to Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cWe can see why this was the largest blockchain hackathon in Russia. Lots of developers brought new ideas to the table. We want to promote these projects that can bring the world closer together and spur innovation. We think that\u2019s the purpose of blockchain technology, and it\u2019s our purpose at Qtum.\u201d\nAlex Bash, one of the cofounders of Zerion, told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cI personally was really inspired by the idea of Wafer, a team that implemented a protocol that allows users and routers to share internet [access]. Their idea is based on smart contracts that guarantee the fair prices and conditions for both parties. Also the Lapti team who developed a product that processes various cryptocurrencies, generates a hot wallet for each user and aggregates their payments to a single wallet after collection of statistics and analytics.\u201d\nEvery one of the 25 teams that participated presented a demo of the software they had created over the weekend.\n\u201cOverall, I think it\u2019s a good result for the hackathon, that most of the teams not only came up with interesting ideas, but developed real products and solutions during the weekend,\u201d said Bash.\nRodion Mikhalev, the director of the Blockchain Education Network in Russia, attended both the conference in Saint Petersburg and the hackathon in Moscow. He said that he expects the community in Russia will continue to grow very quickly. \n\u201cThe Russian Government approved the entire concept of cryptocurrencies a few weeks ago, and a new industry in Russia has been unleashed surrounding blockchain technology,\u201d Mikhalev told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAt the hackathon, we witnessed something new and extraordinary: a combination of smarts and digital innovation and a sense that through the evolution of blockchain technology, we will see Russia quickly rise as a powerhouse in the tech world. There will be a lot of positive products and services adapted to blockchain technology at a rapid pace.\u201d\n\nWhat happens next in regard to blockchain development in Russia remains to be seen, as there are still few blockchain companies that operate in the country. One thing we can be certain of though is that the technology is now high on their radar.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 11}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAccording to a recent study by researchers from the University of Tulsa and Tel Aviv University, the massive increase in the bitcoin price in late 2013 was caused by suspicious trading activity on the now-defunct Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange. The study, which is titled \u201cPrice Manipulation in the Bitcoin Ecosystem,\u201d indicates that 600,000 bitcoins were acquired by agents who did not pay for them, and the bitcoin price rose by an average of $20 on days when the suspicious trading activity took place.\n\u201cBased on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, we conclude that the suspicious trading activity caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months,\u201d the study states.\nAt the center of the study is the infamous Willy bot that was first publicized on a Wordpress blog back in May of 2014.\nThe paper details the data used for the study, identifies the suspicious trading activity and notes that these sorts of manipulative practices may still be possible today, especially in the altcoin markets.\nThe Data Used for the Study\nThis study regarding price manipulation in the Bitcoin markets is based on a data leak of CSV files that included the trading activity on Mt. Gox from April 2011 to November 2013. The researchers behind the study then supplemented that data with more information from bitcoincharts.com.\n\u201cWe performed additional sanity checks of the data utilizing publicly available historical Mt. Gox trading data from bitcoincharts.[com],\u201d reads the report. \u201cWe are confident that the data are high-quality.\u201d\nSuspicious Trading Activity\nIn the leaked data, the report notes that there are suspicious accounts in which the country and state fields are filled in as \u201c??\u201d Many red flags are then found upon further inspection of these accounts.\nIn the case of one account dubbed \u201cMarkus,\u201d the report states that no trading fees are paid and the prices on trades are seemingly random.\n\u201cIn the end, we have concluded that Markus did not actually pay for the bitcoins he acquired; rather, his account was fraudulently credited with claimed bitcoins that almost certainly were not backed by real coins,\u201d states the report. \u201cFurthermore, because transactions were duplicated, no legitimate Mt. Gox customer received the fiat currency Markus supposedly paid to acquire the coins.\u201d\nAccording to the study, Markus acquired a total of 335,898 bitcoins in the 225 days the account was active.\n\nAnother entity noted by the study is known as \u201cWilly\u201d; however, Willy controlled many different accounts. According to the study, Willy appeared roughly seven hours after Markus became inactive.\nThe data cited by the report indicates that Willy would purchase 10\u201319 bitcoins at a time until an amount equal to $2.5 million worth of bitcoins had been purchased. Willy would then make a new account and repeat the process.\nThe study notes that there are indications that the owner of the Willy accounts was a Mt. Gox insider. For example, Willy was able to trade while the Mt. Gox API was offline, and the user ID numbers used by Willy were high for the time period they existed.\nThe study on price manipulation in the Bitcoin ecosystem indicates that Willy acquired 268,132 bitcoins in exchange for $112 million. Much like Markus, Willy did not actually pay for his bitcoins.\n\u201cHence, together, these unauthorized traders \u2018acquired\u2019 around 600,000 bitcoins by November 2013,\u201d says the study. \u201cPerhaps unsurprisingly, this is very close to the number of bitcoins (650,000) that Mt. Gox claimed to have lost when it folded in early 2014.\u201d\nAccording to the study, Markus accounts for 12 percent and Willy accounts for 6 percent of the total trade volume on the four major Bitcoin exchanges on the days they were active.\nIn addition to the possibility of an inside job, the study also notes that an early Bitcoin adopter could have artificially driven up the bitcoin price via a security vulnerability on the exchange in an effort to increase the value of his or her own holdings.\n\u201cWe do not know for sure which, if either, of these scenarios reflect what actually happened,\u201d says the report. \u201cBut that is largely beside the point. Our goal is to demonstrate that these fraudulent trades did in fact significantly impact the price of bitcoin.\u201d\nAccording to the New York Times, former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles admitted to operating the Willy bot in a Japanese court on Tuesday.\nAltcoins Open to Manipulation\nThe researchers behind the study indicate that the importance of price manipulation in digital asset markets will increase as this technology continues to go mainstream. The study indicates that many altcoins are open to this same kind of price manipulation right now.\n\u201cSimilar to the bitcoin market in 2013 (the period we examine), markets for these other crytocurrencies are very thin,\u201d says the report. \u201cOur analysis suggests that manipulation is quite feasible in such settings.\u201d\nCivic CEO Vinny Lingham shared a similar sentiment during a recent talk where he compared altcoins to pump-and-dump penny stocks. \u201cWith altcoins, [pump-and-dump schemes] are super easy,\u201d said Lingham.\n\u201cRegulators may want to begin taking an active oversight role as the Bitcoin ecosystem becomes more integrated into international finance and payment systems,\u201d concludes the study.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 11}

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nAlphaBay, the most popular market on the dark net, has been offline since July 4. Since the administrators of the website failed to issue an official statement about the current issues, many users are suspecting an exit scam. The absence of AlphaBay has since resulted in users looking for alternative underground marketplaces.\nAlphaBay is infamous for being a site where vendors sell all kinds of goods, including illegal ones such as drugs, weapons and stolen financial credentials. There have been previous downtimes at the market; however, since neither the admins, nor the moderators have stated the actual cause of the issue, many users are suspecting an exit scam. An \u201cexit scam\u201d is when either a seller or an illicit marketplace decides to close down shop and make off with the funds (held in escrow) of clients and customers. In March 2015, Evolution Marketplace \u2014 one of the largest underground markets at the time \u2014 left with the funds of its users, cashing out an estimated 40,000 BTC worth approximately $12 million at the time (as of today, the BTC would be valued at $102 million).\n\u201cTrappy,\u201d who is considered the main contact person for AlphaBay, submitted a post on Reddit on July 5 claiming he is in touch with the admins of the dark web marketplace; however, he did not specify the reasons why the market is down. The moderator also warned the users about the dangers that can ensue when a marketplace is offline, such as increased phishing activity in an attempt to steal the cryptocurrencies of misled buyers and sellers.\n\u201cI have been in touch with our devs and admins and they are working to restore AlphaBay as soon as possible. As I have said before, during downtimes, there are added risks that you should understand and be wary of,\u201d Trappy wrote on the /r/DarkNetMarkets subreddit.\nHowever, many users were not satisfied with the moderator\u2019s post. There are plenty of posts with various theories speculating as to why the market has gone down. One user, \u201cArtificial93,\u201d claimed he followed the trail of his bitcoin address on AlphaBay, which pointed to a BTC wallet receiving large amounts of cryptocurrency in the past few days while the marketplace was down. Dark web users also spotted a large bitcoin transaction (1,479 BTC valued at $3.8 million) conducted on July 5. Because of this transaction, more users accused AlphaBay of executing an exit scam. On the other hand, \u201cSarahLKJSGDHF\u201d made a separate post on Reddit in an attempt to calm the community down and call for rationality.\n\u201cYes, [the Bitcoin transaction is] large, and yes, it looks suspicious. But until someone can actually confirm that it's linked to AB, it's really just that \u2014 a large bitcoin transaction. The timing, admittedly, does fit,\u201d the user wrote on the /r/AlphaBayMarket subreddit. \u201cPeople have always screamed \u2018exit scam\u2019 in the past, and they've always been wrong. And I really hope this turns out the same.\u201d\n\u201cXanaxBoss,\u201d a verified vendor on the /r/DarkNetMarkets subreddit, speculated that the reason for the downtime is connected to a law enforcement operation in Quebec, Canada, where authorities raided two separate locations \u201cin connection to a worldwide network with [the] sale of illicit products on the Dark Web.\u201d In the police action \u2014 where the FBI was also involved \u2014 investigators were searching for computer equipment. According to XanaxBoss, the reason why AlphaBay is down at the moment is that one of their servers was seized in Quebec which they are trying to restore.\n\u201cThe FBI didn't bust the market as a whole like they did for Silk Road because Alphabay is much bigger than Silk Road ever was, so it would be logical to believe Alphabay is operating through several servers in different areas of the world. Maybe the FBI just seized one of the mirror servers of Alphabay in Quebec, and there are many other servers located around the world. It would explain the \u2018worldwide\u2019 aspect of the FBI's ongoing investigation that is talked about in the article. I believe right now the \u2018updates\u2019 promised by Trappy and Bigmuscles are actually Alphabay's bosses attempting to secure the rest of their network and replace Quebec\u2019s seized server,\u201d XanaxBoss wrote.\nUntil either law enforcement or the administrators verify any of these claims, they all remain speculation. The only fact we know is that AlphaBay is still down.\nSince the largest dark web marketplace went down, AlphaBay users have been looking for alternative markets. On Reddit, there appear to be multiple posts suggesting Hansa Market as a viable alternative because of the high security the website provides. In addition, the moderator (AlphaBay_mod) for the AlphaBay subreddit has suggested that Hansa admins are unlikely to be able to conduct an exit scam since the \u201cmoney is never kept by Hansa.\u201d The AlphaBay alternative has also eliminated a sticking point for AlphaBay users: finalizing early (FE). In FE listings, the customers have to send the payment directly to the vendors without escrow. This practice has resulted in numerous scams in the dark web community.\nBecause of the \u201chigh influx\u201d of AlphaBay users joining Hansa, the marketplace closed down registrations for a while. In an update to the Reddit topic, AlphaBay_mod hasadvised the community to use the Dream Market since \u201cit seems the only decent market for new users.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 11}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nOne of the key points of contention in the politicization of Bitcoin protocol development over the past couple of years has been the concept of miner signaling. While not intended to be a vote among miners to decide the future of the Bitcoin network, Ciphrex CEO and Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo pointed out that miners are now using the signaling process as leverage in the discussion over Bitcoin scaling.\nLombrozo made the comments during a discussion with host Thomas Hunt and Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song on Hunt\u2019s Mad Bitcoins YouTube channel.\n\u201cThis whole signaling thing is a huge problem that I think created a very terrible narrative,\u201d said Lombrozo.\nWhat Is BIP 9?\nBIP 9 is a method of rolling out soft-fork upgrades to Bitcoin. The short description of this process is that soft-forked changes will be enabled once 95 percent of miners have signaled to the network that they are ready for activation, using a trick called \u201cversion bits.\u201d\n\u201cIt was an arbitrary system created by developers in order to coordinate smooth soft-fork transitions,\u201d said Lombrozo. \u201cIt was not designed to be a political system for voting on controversial issues ever \u2014 that was never the intention.\u201d\nLombrozo also noted that, in the past, soft forks have been deployed on Bitcoin without any special treatment for miners, and BIP 9 was supposed to solve some of the issues miners could face during the deployment of a soft fork.\n\u201cIt was introduced for the courtesy of miners to be able to reduce their orphan rates and reduce the probability that they\u2019re going to end up mining blocks that are actually invalid \u2014 that was the real motivation behind it,\u201d said Lombrozo.\nAccording to Lombrozo, the goal is still to get nodes upgraded and enforce the rules of the soft fork; BIP 9 was simply a technique to coordinate with miners.\nThe Ciphrex CEO added that there was nothing like miner signaling in the original version of Bitcoin, and Satoshi Nakamoto never used miner signaling for the soft forks that he deployed on the network.\n\u201cIt was a mechanism that was created way later,\u201d said Lombrozo. \u201cAnd once this mechanism was created, it was abused and turned against the developers to try to extort stuff. And now it\u2019s being used against businesses to extort stuff from them.\u201d\nBIP 9 Does Not Work With Uncooperative Miners\nAccording to Lombrozo, BIP 9 would not have been used for Segregated Witness (SegWit) if the contributors to Bitcoin Core knew then what they know now.\n\u201cIf we considered that there had been this kind of, like, contentious or adversarial situation, then BIP 9 would not have been used,\u201d said Lombrozo. \u201cWe would not have used the signaling mechanism because it obviously does not work under those kinds of circumstances.\u201d\nIn Lombrozo\u2019s view, miners are now using the effective veto power that comes with the miner signaling process outlined in BIP 9 as leverage in the discussions around scaling Bitcoin. He also believes Bitcoin Core developers may deserve some of the blame for using BIP 9 in the first place.\n\u201cBut at the same time, we only had the best of intentions at the moment,\u201d added Lombrozo. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d gotten through all these disagreements and it seemed like the miners were for it and going to support it \u2026 Obviously, the adversarial case needs to be considered because it\u2019s just the nature of this network and the way that it works.\u201d\nLombrozo suggested that miners also used miner signaling as a sort of \u201cpropaganda\u201d tool with Bitcoin Unlimited, even though there was no activation mechanism included in the code.\nNever Use BIP 9 Again?\nAccording to Lombrozo, miners now think they have some control over the protocol due to the use of the miner signaling process outlined in BIP 9.\n\u201cMiners started thinking, \u2018Hey, maybe we have control over the protocol because of this whole signaling thing,\u2019\u201d said Lombrozo during his discussion with Hunt and Song.\nLombrozo claimed that \u201cwe\u2019re never going to use BIP 9 to deploy anything almost for sure\u201d if SegWit is not activated via the current BIP 9 deployment.\nAs an alternative, Bitcoin Core could turn to BIP 8, which is a variation of BIP 9 from pseudonymous developer Shaolin Fry that eventually activates a soft-forking change whether miners have signaled for it or not. Miners can still activate the change before it is automatically locked-in on the network, but approval from miners is not required before that lock-in takes place.\nWatch the full episode here:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 7}

According to some of its proponents, the proposal, known as SegWit2x, is said to be the only viable solution to the Bitcoin scaling debate.\nHowever, agreeing to initiate a hard fork without knowing how speculators will react to such a change comes with risks. If there is not full support for the hard fork from bitcoin holders, the end result could be a split of Bitcoin into two separate cryptocurrency networks, which could cause extreme brand confusion among the general public (depending on the severity of the split).\nIn addition to the potential risks of a permanent split of the community, SegWit2x also ignores tools that could be used to get the intended benefits of this particular hard-forking increase to capacity without the possibility of a network split.\nPerhaps most troubling, SegWit2x ignores the reasons as to why Bitcoin is useful in the first place.\nSpeculators Call the Shots\nWhile the original Medium post regarding the New York Agreement claimed the signatories accounted for $5.1 billion worth of monthly on-chain transaction volume (more than half of the entire network for April), the general view of SegWit2x from bitcoin holders is unclear at this time. Companies representing large amounts of bitcoin holdings (Digital Currency Group, Coinbase, Xapo, etc.) have signed onto the agreement as well, but we have yet to see speculators have the chance to set a price for the hard-forked chain.\nAs of now, the hard-fork portion of SegWit2x appears to be contentious, which means exchanges are likely to list both the original chain and the chain with a hard-forking increase to the block size limit. Companies that take custody of their users\u2019 bitcoins will need to allow their users to withdraw both coins.\nAlthough more than 80 percent of the network hashrate has agreed to run the SegWit2x code, it\u2019s possible that speculators will prefer the non-hard fork chain. It\u2019s also possible that a futures market could illustrate this point before the hard fork takes place.\nOf course, miners could decide to mine at a loss and not listen to the market, which would theoretically go against the incentives of the Bitcoin system. If miners abandon the chain preferred by users, it\u2019s possible that a proof-of-work change will be needed, as faith in the current miners may be lost.\nSuch a scenario could be disastrous for Bitcoin, which means miners (and everyone else in the ecosystem) should be incentivized to avoid it. But we\u2019ll have to see what happens.\nIf These Companies Control Bitcoin, Then a Public Blockchain is Not Needed\nThe point of Bitcoin is that it allows everyone to have full control over their money without the need for a trusted third party. There is no third party in Bitcoin because no one controls the consensus rules. If someone is in control of Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules, then they\u2019ve effectively become the third party that the system was designed to avoid in the first place.\nWith the New York Agreement, the signatories are basically saying they control the rules of Bitcoin (or at least the fork of Bitcoin that they\u2019ve all agreed to run). If that\u2019s the case, then the need for a public blockchain is less clear. Users would effectively be trusting these institutions with the rules of the system and ordering of transactions because they could decide to completely change the rules via a hard fork at any point in time. If the system is no longer trustless, Sybil attacks on the state of the blockchain can be thwarted by having trusted entities sign blocks rather than miners.\nWith that in mind, it may make more sense to launch a federated sidechain pegged to Bitcoin\u2019s main chain instead of trying to turn the main chain into a trusted system. This would allow the main chain to retain Bitcoin\u2019s core value proposition of permissionless money while the sidechain can process the microtransactions these companies desire.\nThe signatories of the New York Agreement could become the functionaries of the sidechain, where they\u2019d control the consensus rules and sign blocks. This sort of setup makes much more sense if users are supposed to trust these entities anyway. A much more efficient transaction network can be created when proof-of-work and decentralization are thrown out the window.\nIn fact, this is exactly what Blockstream\u2019s Liquid sidechain is supposed to achieve early next year. Ironically, some of the signers of the New York Agreement are supposed to be participants in Blockstream\u2019s upcoming federated sidechain.\nIf there are no goals for SegWit2x other than increasing capacity on the Bitcoin network, then a federated sidechain is a much better alternative. There\u2019s no risk of a chain split, capacity can be increased exponentially higher than the twofold increase offered by the hard-fork portion of SegWit2x, and other features, such as Confidential Transactions and faster block times, can also be implemented.\nPut in this perspective, SegWit2x is completely nonsensical. I\u2019m not sure what the New York Agreement will lead to over the next few months, but it appears to be unnecessarily risky.\nThis article is a guest post by Kyle Torpey.

Bitcoin Schmitcoin became popular within the subculture of the Reddit communities and now posts his daily thoughts and market outlook via Twitter and his regular stream on Twitch.tv.\nBitcoin Schmitcoin on Twitch.tv\n\nBitcoin Schmitcoin: YouTube\nThis morning marked another bearish day in the crypto-space as the entire market cap continued its multi-week-long decline. As referenced in a previous BTC-USD price analysis, we have continued to test the neckline of a massive, multi-week-long Head-and-Shoulders reversal pattern. At the time of this article, the market is making its second test of the ascending trendline (marked in yellow).\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 6-hr Candles, Gemini, Head-and-Shoulders Pattern\nA breakdown of the ascending trendline typically marks a very characteristic, sustained market reversal that, in our case, has a price projection in the upper $1,800 range (see this previous analysis for a detailed breakdown of Head-and-Shoulders price target calculation).\nWhen confirming the Head-and-Shoulders reversal pattern, key support levels on the way down toward its price projection include the following markers:\n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 6-hr Candles, GDAX, Key Support Levels\nA break of the ascending trendline is often initially rejected before continuing its trend downward \u2014 hence, the multiple attempts to break the trendline. However, typically, a sustained move below this trendline is very likely to continue downward and test the next two support levels.The first attempt to complete the right Shoulder/the first attempt at breaking the ascending trendline was rejected in the form of a Double Bottom Reversal (see this previous analysis for details). At the time of this article, we are making a test of the key, pivotal support line that began the Double Bottom Reversal. A breakdown of this support line is one of the first signs that a long-term, sustained bear market is likely.The initial support line that separated the \u201cHead\u201d from the right \u201cShoulder\u201d is of specific significance because the high volume shows the failed market attempt to rally off the largest drop in price since the high $2,900s.\nWhen looking at support lines, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that these are not concrete, rigid lines. Rather, they are elastic and should be treated more like \u201czones\u201d of support, rather than \u201clines.\u201d One thing to consider when trading the Head-and-Shoulders pattern is that an initial strong move below the neckline is often rejected along a known support line and will lead to a re-test of the neckline from the bottom. A break below the descending trendline support will ultimately become a strong level of resistance. Below are the potential price trajectories should the market decide to break below the descending trendline:\n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 6-hr Candles, GDAX, Support Line Tests\nSummary:\nBTC-USD is currently in the process of testing crucial support levels of a Head-and-Shoulders reversal pattern.Failure to maintain support could have a potential sustained bear market with a price target of approximately $1,800.\n\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Three years later, it appears that drivechains, which are a specific way of implementing sidechains, will be the way in which extensions for Bitcoin are rolled out.\nSidechains remove the need for altcoins by allowing bitcoins to be effectively transferred from one blockchain to another. This means the bitcoin token can be used on any type of blockchain that bitcoin holders demand into existence.\nDrivechains Should Be Good Enough\nDrivechains were designed by Bloq Economist Paul Sztorc, who started working on the idea after the lack of progress on sidechains slowed down his own project, a decentralized prediction market known as Bitcoin Hivemind.\nIn Sztorc\u2019s view, the security model for drivechains is not much different than that of the main Bitcoin blockchain because the funds on the drivechain are held in escrow by bitcoin miners. Some developers, such as Peter Todd, have shared technical concerns with merge-mined sidechains in the past, but this concept is likely going to be tried out in the wild, whether the contributors to Bitcoin Core like it or not. Sztorc has also attempted to address these technical concerns through the use of blind merged mining.\nIn terms of the risk of miners stealing the funds held in escrow, Sztorc has pointed out that a similar risk already exists in Bitcoin: A cartel of miners could theoretically defraud a bitcoin exchange by selling bitcoins on the exchange and then later rewriting the chain history in a way obscures or erases the original deposit so that it appears it never took place.\nDrivechains can be added to Bitcoin via soft forks, which means they are backward compatible. If there is sufficient demand for a specific type of drivechain, miners should be happy to mine on the additional chain in order to generate more revenue by way of transaction fees.\nFeatures of popular drivechains could theoretically be soft-forked into Bitcoin by way of an extension block or some other measure, but it\u2019s unclear if this would even be necessary.\nWhat Types of Drivechains Are in Development?\nThe three main niches that have gained interest from altcoin speculators are microtransactions (lower transaction fees), smart contracts and privacy.\nBoth Ethereum and Litecoin are said to be useful alternatives to Bitcoin because they have lower transaction fees. One of the first intended drivechains is one with bigger blocks which would allow users to transact with lower fees in a manner that does not negatively affect the decentralization of Bitcoin\u2019s main chain.\nAlthough it\u2019s still unclear if there is much substance behind the drastic rise in Ethereum\u2019s market cap, RSK has built a sidechain focused on complex smart contracts that is a hybrid between a drivechain and a federated sidechain. The RSK platform is currently pegged to Bitcoin\u2019s testnet, and it is expected to launch on mainnet later this year.\nIn terms of privacy, there are intentions to add a MimbleWimble sidechain to Bitcoin, although the mechanism that will be used to peg the sidechain to Bitcoin is unclear at this time. In addition to MimbleWimble, it\u2019s also possible that a Monero, Zcash or other privacy-focused sidechains could be released if there is enough demand.\nThere is a full list of sidechain projects available on the Drivechain website.\nAlternative Tokens May Still Exist\nWhile drivechains are likely to drive out the need for altcoins, it\u2019s still possible that alternative digital assets that are not attempts at creating a new form of money will exist.\nSztorc\u2019s own project creates a new token, votecoin, which is required for the decentralized prediction market to work. With this setup, bitcoin is used as the transactional currency while votecoins are used as a sort of stake in the network to get the incentives to work properly.\nTo me, it\u2019s unclear how often these sorts of new tokens will be needed, but there should be no reason for competitors to bitcoin as a form of digital money to exist.\nA Chain Split Could Still Cause Problems\nOne last thing to keep in mind is that a chain split in Bitcoin could invalidate the hypothesis laid out in this article. If there is a split, then the network effects around Bitcoin could be weakened, which would open the door for an alternative cryptocurrency to take Bitcoin\u2019s place.\nThe supporters of the SegWit2x proposal intend to activate a hard-forking increase to Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit later this year, but it is extremely unlikely that this change will be implemented in Bitcoin Core, which means a chain split is a possibility.\nThe negative effects of such a situation would depend on the severity of the split and how the market reacts.\nIf a big block drivechain is prepared in time, it may be able to decrease the attraction some in the Bitcoin ecosystem have toward a hard fork.\n\nThank you to drivechain developer Patrick Murphy for answering a few questions during the writing of this article.\nKyle Torpey is a freelance writer and researcher who has been following Bitcoin since 2011.

Recently, after a Change.org petition from an outraged GainBitcoin investor surfaced, the group behind the scheme launched an Ethereum ICO (initial coin offering) in an effort to keep the probable scam going.\nFor those who haven\u2019t heard of GainBitcoin, it purports to be a Bitcoin cloud-mining operation; the operation, in turn, is connected to Amit Bhardwaj, founder of Bitcoin mining pool GBMiners. Some Bitcoin companies based in India, such as Zebpay, have warned their customers about schemes like GainBitcoin due to the unrealistic profits for potential investors that are included in their marketing materials.\nWith the launch of a new token on Ethereum, combined with a marketing campaign that includes support from major Indian newspapers and Bollywood celebrities, it appears this dubious scheme has new life.\nAccording to Bitsonline, GAW Miners Founder Josh Garza used a similar method when inventing Paycoin to continue making payments related to his Ponzi scheme.\nThe Launch of a New Token\nThe new token launched by Bhardwaj is known as MCAP, and it was officially launched by the Bitcoin Growth Fund, which is another one of Bhardwaj\u2019s creations. According to the website, the MCAP ICO raised over $19 million at a sale price of $5 per token. The website also claims nearly five million MCAP tokens were sold, some at a discounted rate.\nA video posted on the Bitcoin Growth Fund website has similarities to videos associated with the notorious OneCoin scam. For example, the video projects that, according to \u201cvarious estimates,\u201d the MCAP price could go as high as $100 by May 2018. The video goes as far as to recommend purchasing the token as the price declines as a way to generate even higher returns.\nThe MCAP token is said to derive its value from investments in cryptocurrency mining, but the connection between the token and cryptocurrency mining profits is never explained.\nAlthough CoinMarketCap indicates MCAP is ranked 35th out of all digital assets by market cap, the cryptocurrency price site indicates a circulating supply of over 30 million tokens. According to Ethplorer, 100 million MCAP tokens exist, but it\u2019s unclear how many of them are in circulation.\nThe token is currently trading at a little under $4 on cryptocurrency exchange C-CEX. Veteran cryptocurrency trader Jeremy Ross told Bitcoin Magazine that C-CEX is \u201cone of those exchanges you go to to buy the trash.\u201d\nAt this time, C-CEX and EtherDelta are the only two exchanges where MCAP is listed other than an exchange on the Bitcoin Growth Fund website. It\u2019s unclear how reliable the trading data on the Bitcoin Growth Fund website is since it is also connected to Bhardwaj. OneCoin also hosted an exchange for their own coin at one time, but the exchange, Xcoinx, is currently offline.\nA Cryptocurrency Book for Beginners\nLike many scams in the Bitcoin space, MCAP is targeted at beginners who do not know the first thing about these sorts of digital assets. Indeed, Amit Bhardwaj has a new book out, titled \u201cCryptocurrency for Beginners.\u201d\nThe book is priced at 1,499 Indian rupees (around $23 USD), but those who purchase the book also receive 1,200 Indian rupees\u2019 worth of MCAP for free, as a way to get started with cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn addition to peddling his new book to Bitcoin-related news outlets, such as The Cointelegraph and NewsBTC, Bhardwaj was also able to get full, front-page ads for the book in two of India\u2019s largest newspapers: Times of India and Hindustan Times.\nMultiple Bollywood celebrities with millions of followers on Twitter have also sent out supportive tweets about the book over the past couple of weeks. \nSo, with the creation of this new token, GainBitcoin now has the ability to make more payouts to their investors because they can only receive their payouts via MCAP. With the Ethereum ICO, GainBitcoin has effectively created more money out of thin air to keep the scheme going.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 12}
{"title": "Got a Coinbase Account and an Opinion on Bitcoin Scaling? Be Heard on KYCPoll", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/got-coinbase-account-and-opinion-bitcoin-scaling-be-heard-kycpoll/", "birthday": "Jul 12, 2017  5:10 PM EST", "date": "2017-07-12 22:10:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin\u2019s ongoing scaling debate is reaching fever pitch. Several scaling proposals are scheduled to activate within the next weeks, which may or may not be adopted. This could even lead to segments of users and miners\u00a0splitting off from the current Bitcoin protocol, resulting in different types of \u201cBitcoin.\u201d\nOne reason the several sides in this dispute have trouble agreeing on a single path forward is that all claim support from users on their preferred scaling solution. And this difference, in turn, results from the fact that it\u2019s difficult to reliably gauge user sentiment. \nBitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots developer Luke Dashjr launched one potential solution to this problem this week: a scaling poll that requires Coinbase identity verification to participate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously not perfect, because not everyone uses Coinbase,\u201d the developer noted. \u201cBut it's one more useful source of data.\u201d\nKYCPoll is, of course, not the first poll to gauge user sentiment. Twitter and other social media have been splattered with scaling polls over the past couple of months. Reddit and other forums have hosted fierce public debates for years. And there are even some experimental coin-voting schemes, not to mention miners\u2019 hash power signalling.\nBut user-focused polls, in particular, are often easily gamed or have other reliability issues. One of several problems is that typical internet polls can be manipulated by users that vote with a number fake identities. These \u201cSybil attacks\u201d can severely skew the outcomes.\nTo counter this, Dashjr\u2019s initiative utilizes a programming tool (\u201cAPI\u201d) offered by Coinbase, the major bitcoin exchange and de-facto wallet service that quite possibly holds the biggest database of user data in the Bitcoin industry.\u00a0Leveraging the API, only users that have proven their identity to the bitcoin exchange are able to vote on KYCPoll. Since Coinbase applies a rigorous Know Your Customer (KYC) process to verify identities, this should only include real people.\n\"This method is Sybil-resistant, doesn't weigh rich people more than not-so-rich people, and doesn't require compromising your coins' security to take the poll,\" Dashjr pointed out, explaining KYCPoll's benefits.\nWith scaling as an overlapping topic, there are several core issues being polled right now. This includes support for\u00a0Segregated Witness (SegWit), the protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. A closely related topic is BIP148, the user activated soft fork (UASF) scheduled to activate SegWit on August 1. Sentiments on SegWit2x and other proposals to hard fork an increase of the \u201cbase block size limit\" are gauged as well. And other topics in the poll include questions about soft forks, as well as governance issues and media consumption.\n\nScreenshot of a few results from KYCPoll - 17:00 EST July 12, 2017\nEven though KYCPoll is a clever use of the Coinbase API, it is, of course, in no way binding. And Dashjr acknowledged it\u2019s not even a definite solution for gauging user sentiment. This is most obviously because only Coinbase users can vote, and not everyone has a Coinbase account. At the same time, having a Coinbase account does not necessarily mean someone is a bitcoin user (Coinbase also offers other cryptocurrencies), nor does it reveal how \u201cheavy\u201d of a user it is. Plus, KYCPoll is not as anonymous as some would like: while Coinbase does not get to see what users vote, Dashjr does.\nSome of these issues may be improved upon, while it could also be possible to extend KYCPoll to include KYC-registered users from other Bitcoin companies \u2014 not only Coinbase.\nBut Dashjr noted that he\u2019s unlikely to implement these improvements himself, and instead hopes that someone else will pick up on the open source project to further develop it.\n\u201cThis is a kind of a side project I'm doing only because nobody else had done it yet. I'm not a web developer, which also explains why I explicitly don't guarantee the data is secure. I hope someone more into web development will take over the project,\u201d he said.\nTo vote on your preferred scaling solution, or just view the poll results so far, click\u00a0this link.

However, any modifications to the consensus layer, the critical part of any cryptocurrency, must be handled with caution. Compared to other internet protocols, this makes it harder for Bitcoin to adopt new features and meet new demands. This is why sidechain technology has been proposed: It allows for the transfer of digital assets, including bitcoin, across different blockchains.\nWhile most cryptocurrencies are incompatible, assets are not interchangeable; \u201cfusion\u201d lets sidechains build the financial ecosystem of cryptocurrencies. Using sidechains, we can easily create smart contract-based stocks, futures and other derivatives; there could be thousands of sidechains pegged to Bitcoin, all serving different purposes and having different features. Meanwhile, all of these sidechains benefit from the robustness, and maintain the coin scarcity, of the main chain.\nSo far, some of the sidechain solutions on the market include BTC Relay by ConsenSys, Rootstock by RSK, Elements by Blockstream and non-Bitcoin sidechains like Lisk. \nBTC Relay\nBTC Relay, born from the Ethereum Foundation and developed by ConsenSys, is believed to be the first functional sidechain project \u2014 although it\u2019s technically perhaps better described as an \u201catomic swap.\u201d The main principle of BTC Relay is that it connects the Ethereum network with the Bitcoin network in a safe and decentralized way. \nBTC Relay allows users to verify Bitcoin transactions through smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. As such, the sidechain mechanism allows user to send transactions, not only to another address or account, but also to other blockchains. \nSpecifically, BTC Relay uses Bitcoin\u2019s block header to create a tiny version of the Bitcoin blockchain. Ethereum Dapp developers can then verify the Bitcoin network activity by connecting to the BTC Relay smart contract. (It does so through a dedicated API.)\nAs a result, a typical use case of BTC Relay could look like this:\n1. Alice and Bob agree to use the BTCSwap contract (user contract) to trade. Alice wants to buy ETH from Bob. Bob sends his ETH to the BTCSwap contract and the ETH will be locked.\n2. Alice then sends BTC to Bob, and \u2014 importantly \u2014 she wants the BTCSwap contract to be informed so that the BTCSwap contract can release Bob's ETH deposit to her.\n3. Alice calls the BTC Relay function using the Bitcoin transaction and the BTCSwap contract address. After the BTCRelay function has confirmed that the bitcoin transaction is valid, the BTCSwap contract will be triggered and will verify the Bitcoin transaction.\n4. After the BTCSwap confirms the legitimacy of the BTC Relay address, Bob\u2019s ETH will be released to Alice and the transaction is completed.\n\nRootstock\nRootstock (or RSK) is the first universal smart contract platform secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. Its goal is to implement complex smart contracts on a sidechain, adding value and functionality to the Bitcoin network. \nThe way this works is that when a Bitcoin user wants to use two-way anchors, he sends a transaction to a multi-signature address. The key holders of this wallet, the \u201cfederation,\u201d can (for example) consist of several well-known companies. \nThe RSK blockchain uses the public key associated with the funding transaction to store the smart bitcoin (SBTC). This means that the private key that controls the bitcoins in this transaction can be used to control a corresponding amount on the RSK blockchain. \nAlthough the public key and the private keys are similar, each blockchain uses a different format to encode addresses. This means that the addresses on the two blockchains are different.\nElements \nThe Elements sidechain is an open-source sidechain project developed by Blockstream. Like Rootstock, the project adopts two-way pegging to Bitcoin. In addition to smart contracts, the project also introduces many other innovative features, including private transactions, Segregated Witness and new instruction code to support more functions, among others.\nLisk \nLisk is a new generation of blockchain platform that adds each application to a separate sidechain of Lisk. \nUsers who have experienced Bitcoin and Ethereum are probably aware that features and data are added to the main blockchain, which leads to rapid blockchain bloat. Extra large block sizes require a long time to synchronize, which is a painful experience. \nLisk's sidechain model instead provides a way to solve the problem of network congestion under high transaction volume. Users just need to download the corresponding sidechain for a specific use case when using the relevant application. This greatly reduces the sync time for downloading unnecessary data and facilitates the efficient operation of the entire Lisk network. Also, the speed of the Lisk network promises to continue to accelerate over time, which ought to give it a special advantage.\nA Model of the Bytom Sidechain\nBytom is an inter-operational protocol for multiple \u201cbyte assets.\u201d \nIn order to operate different on-chain assets running on Bytom, developers can create a tiny version of a sidechain. Let\u2019s use, for example, one version called \u201cXRelay,\u201d which functions similar to BTC Relay. Dapp developers can then connect to the API of XRelay via a smart contract to verify the network activities of \u201cX Chain,\u201d the alternative blockchain XRelay connects with. In this way, cross-chain communication can complete transactional and dividend distribution contained within the contract. \nBytom will support multiple types of digital assets (for example, gold, silver, etc). Each asset will be identified by an asset ID, which will be based on the \u201cODIN\u201d protocol. With various asset IDs, we can confirm the categories of that asset. \nThe Bytom chain sorts all assets into two categories: the Bytom token (BTM) and all other digital assets. BTM is the native currency of the Bytom blockchain, which is a special token distributed to miners and other participants in the ecosystem. BTM is based on a Proof-of-Work mechanism to encourage miners to join in the system in a random and anonymous way. \nThe BTM could be used for\nCosts of asset transactions, including the cost of running the smart contract;Dividends of income assets; andDeposits for asset issuance.\nIf the asset issuer, for example, decides to use BTC as dividends, he can lock in the corresponding amount of BTC via a sidechain and convert it into BTM at market rate. This process is executed by the type of Relay contract described through a cross-chain operation. \nFor example, if we want to swap BTM with Bitcoin, we can do it using a Bytom chain contract like this:\n\n\nSidechain technology is appropriate for the mission of Bytom: to build a market where \u201cbyte assets\u201d and assets on different blockchains can interact and be exchanged freely. Bytom will facilitate the exchange, interoperation and flow of byte information and byte assets that are stores of value.\nJeason Yi, author of this guest post, is senior engineer of Bytom.io.

He is a professional journalist with a keen interest in innovative digital technology. He has written for a host of newspapers and digital sources in South Africa, and around the world, on topics such as sport, business, technology and cryptocurrency.\nIt comes with the territory that digital currency will be susceptible to digital threats. Hacking and theft have almost grown up side by side with things like Bitcoin, and, as the popularity and value of the digital currency rises, its attraction to thieves also grows.\nThe most recent major hack has seen one of the top five biggest Bitcoin and Ethereum exchanges, Bithumb in South Korea, fall prey to hackers. The hack was confirmed July 5 when information, as well as hundreds of millions of South Korean won, were been made off with in an attack with a difference.\nMost exchanges know they are susceptible to network intrusion via their internal systems, but the entry point in this instance was through the personal computer of one of the exchange's employees. Thus it was not the standard network compromise, rather a more sophisticated phishing attack that led to the information heist.\nIt was personal information, such as names, email address and phone numbers of clients that were predominantly taken \u2014 luckily no passwords \u2014 but this was enough for the hackers to target customers and drain their accounts of their cryptocurrency.\nSince the highly publicized Mt. Gox hack in 2014, in which 800,000 bitcoins were stolen, exchanges have boosted their security astronomically. Mt. Gox almost spelled the end of Bitcoin as people lost a lot of faith \u2014 as well as a lot of money \u2014 in the security systems of cryptocurrencies.\nWhile security has been boosted in recent times, and thievery and hacking is far less common, it is still a threat that is ongoing and sometimes hidden.\nIn fact, Bithumb customers had forwarded complaints on a Korean social media site about threats of attacks, yet not much extra was done on the part of the exchange to try and quell these worries or protect clients.\nThe exact figure stolen is still unknown as Bithumb is trying to play it off as less of a hack and more of a phishing attack for information. However, despite what they are trying to convey, Bithumb has to admit that the 30,000 customers whose information was compromised were victims of a dangerous cryptocurrency attack.\nThe Korean exchange has come forward and said it will be compensating those whose data was compromised. Even those customers who would have lost nothing other than data will be getting paid 100,000 Korean Won, which is equivalent to around $86.50 USD for the inconvenience. The hope for Bithumb is that they will be able to retain some of these clients who surely will be feeling much more vulnerable and less trusting.\nBithumb's transactions with bitcoin make up almost 3 percent of the entire market, but it is its share of ether transactions that\u2019s its major claim to fame: 13.5 percent of the total ether market goes through Bithumb\u2019s exchange.\nIt is a major blow for a big player in the exchange game, and it is a blow that will be felt in the global digital currency sphere. Trust has slowly been rebuilt for those who have lived through the teething stages of Bitcoin security, and, as the door opens on new and mainstream markets, hacks like this can cause adopters to have second thoughts.\nHowever, one aspect of digital security that has changed since bitcoin has been accepted by a much wider audience is that governmental agencies are taking it under their wing. \nThere are differing stages of regulation for digital currencies, but these arguably bring with them added security. In the case of Bithumb, Korea\u2019s Internet and Security Agency has plans to initiate a probe into this cyber attack with a full investigation to follow.\n", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 13}

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nTheo Chino, a bitcoin advocate who has been fighting regulations in the U.S. for over two years, requested the withdrawal of the proposed \u201cUniform Regulation of Virtual Currency Businesses Act.\u201d\nOnly July 7, 2017, Chino asked the Uniform Law Commission (ULC) to withdraw the proposed regulation on cryptocurrencies in the United States. The bitcoin advocate submitted a letter to the ULC asking to abandon the proposed statute. Chino argued that many of the states have \u201csignificant disagreements and approaches as to how to classify or regulate bitcoin.\u201d In addition, there is a high level of legal uncertainty surrounding the proposed statute due to a legal challenge against the New York BitLicense \u2014 also known as the Virtual Currency Regulation \u2014 before the New York courts.\nThe legal challenge, which Chino cited in his letter to the ULC, is a lawsuit he initiated against the New York State Department of Financial Services (\u201cNYDFS\u201d). In October 2015, Chino started an action against the NYDFS regarding BitLicense arguing that the agency \u201cexceeded its regulatory mandate, and that regulating Bitcoin lies with the legislature, not NYDFS.\u201d\n\u201cThis proposed model statute, which is inspired by the New York BitLicense, will not only make it impossible for a small Bitcoin business to survive, but also will discourage the public to use Bitcoin. One does not have to look very far to understand why Bitcoin\u2019s adoption is so low and so poor. This kind of arbitrary and negative intervention must stop,\u201d said Chino.\nIn a post on Reddit, Chino stated he spoke twice with the chair of the Virtual Currency Committee. The chair of the committee told Chino he should take the case to a legal level if he disagrees with the proposed statute.\n\u201cThis last conversation led me to believe that he [the chair of the committee] did not care about the academic search on the true nature of Bitcoin but is more interested in his personal notoriety as the chair of the committee. He really did not know how the technology really worked and why that act is bad,\u201d Chino wrote on Reddit.\u201cHe did admit that he represented the industry and not the individual small business.\u201d\nCoinbase\nCoinbase, a digital currency exchange complying with the New York BitLicense, is currently under investigation by the Internal Revenue Service. However, this week it was reported that the IRS is scaling back the investigation. The IRS is now only seeking information on Coinbase users who were engaged in transactions of $20,000 or more. This means that the agency will exempt all the users who did not buy, sell, send or receive \"at least the equivalent of $20,000 in any one transaction type in any one year during the 2013-15 period.\"\nBobby Lee on Need for Regulation\nEarlier this year, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) halted the withdrawals of bitcoin at Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges, which also affected Bobby Lee\u2019s company, BTCC. In an attempt to regulate the market, the PBOC created a task force for inspecting the trade of digital currencies. The goal of the task force is to ensure that cryptocurrency exchanges had implemented anti-money laundering systems. In the same month, the PBOC announced it had met with nine virtual currency exchanges to warn them about the consequences of violating the rules.\nThis move by the PBOC has been perceived as an attempt to crack down on the bitcoin trade, but Bobby Lee, the CEO of the Chinese bitcoin exchange BTCC, does not seem to share that view.\nIn contrast to what is coming out of the U.S., Lee said in a CNBC interview this week that cryptocurrencies are in need of more regulations. According to him, if there are no regulations, digital currencies can suffer high volatility.\n\"It's not really a crackdown,\" Lee said. \"The central bank previously was not very aware of the details of how bitcoin is utilized, how bitcoin is traded.\"\nHowever, Lee added that it is essential for regulators to take the time to come up with the \u201cappropriate rules and laws to govern companies, how we do business, to govern individuals [and] how people conduct business online.\u201d\n\"I think regulation is much needed for this new asset class because otherwise it'll run amok from society. But the challenge is how to craft the rules around this new technology.\u201d \n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 13}

However, when it came time to re-test the neckline, the ETH-USD market decided to continue its move down. So why did the Double Bottom Reversal, outlined in a previous BTC-USD analysis, not yield the results during yesterday\u2019s rally?\nFigure 1: \u00a0ETH-USD, 1-hr Candles, GDAX, Fake Double Bottom\nIn the article referenced above, several criteria outline the price projections one can expect from a Double Bottom Reversal pattern. One of the most crucial aspect of a Double Bottom Reversal is the volume supported on the two lower peaks of the pattern. In the figure shown above, the left example of the Double Bottom pattern is support with obvious spikes in volume where the market attempted to make a new low. However, in our case, we see a pattern that looks like a Double Bottom, but lacks the required volume to really send the reversal pattern in a significant bullish rally.\nSo, now that we\u2019ve failed to reverse this bear trend once again, where does this leave us in the grand scheme of things? \u00a0To put this market into perspective, it is often useful to zoom out and view it on a high timescale:\nFigure 2: \u00a0ETH-USD, 12-hr Candles, Gemini, Macro Bear Trend\nOne of the most notable things about this bear trend is the failure to make a new high, time and time again. Each failure to make a new high has been coupled with an increase in overall market volume, which acts an initial indicator that the market still has more bearish pressure on it. Next, if we move on to the MACD (an indicator of market momentum), we can see two things:\nThe current bearish period is showing no sign of divergence \u2014 each relative low made in the market is coupled with a low on the MACD histogram.Most important, the macro bear trend shows maintained downward momentum by the way the signal line / moving average have made a new low (see the orange, dashed line).\nAt the time of this article, the market is finding major support and resistance levels along the Fibonacci Retracement values of the macro Bear trend (see pink notation in the image above). The fake Double Bottom Reversal propelled the market back up enough to test the 23 percent retracement value before ultimately pivoting with relative ease. On the macro scale, the next major line of support lies at our previous low: $175. It will be a hard-fought battle as this is a line of historic interest within the lifetime of the market.\nAs the market proceeds its march toward the bottom, the various lines of the Fibonacci Retracements will play a key role for entering and exiting positions. Most commonly, before progressing to the next Fibonacci Retracement line, the market will make a test of the resisting line above it before continuing the downward trend. The figure below outlines the recurring theme of this macro bear trend\u2019s Fibonacci Retracement tests:\nFigure 3: \u00a0ETH-USD, 6-hr Candles, Gemini, Fibonacci Retracement Trend\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that the market won\u2019t make it back down to to the 0 percent Fibonacci Retracement values, but, given the downward momentum outlined on several market indicators, it seems far more likely than not. With the massive Head and Shoulders (outlined earlier this week) on the BTC-USD markets looming in the background and testing key support levels, one can only speculate just how far the crypto-market will continue its downward move.\nSummary:\nA fake Double Bottom Reversal formed on the smaller timescales, trapping many people in a bullish position.On a macro scale, the ETH-USD is maintaining its downward momentum and continues to test Fibonacci Retracement values.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nAs of September 2017, the Swiss town of Zug will offer all of its citizens a digital identity on the Ethereum blockchain.\nZug, a Swiss town with the population of nearly 30,000 citizens, has been famous for its dedication to cryptocurrencies. Zug has been called the \u201cCrypto Valley\u201d of the financial world since many of its citizens are entrepreneurs who specialize in digital currencies. Numerous Bitcoin and blockchain enthusiasts have flocked to the town to take advantage of the entrepreneurial environment and the crypto-awareness of the citizens. Last year, the town even began accepting bitcoin payments for government services on a trial basis. In addition, one of the 10 bitcoin ATMs in Switzerland is in Zug, which is operated by the Zug-based Bitcoin Suisse.\nOn July 7, Zug published a press release on its official website stating its plans to offer digital identities for its citizens. According to the press release, the digital identities will be based on an app that \u201csecures personal information using blockchain technology and associates it with a crypto address.\u201d The system is completely decentralized, thus the citizens will register their identities on the app independently, which will be verified by the town\u2019s own \u201cidentity control\u201d procedures.\nThe Swiss government, in cooperation with external partners, is currently focusing on a centralized solution to create its own digital ID service. However, according to Zug\u2019s press release, the government\u2019s efforts have failed since the application of a centralized digital system is complicated and such systems are \u201ctechnically considered obsolete today.\u201d\n\"We want a single electronic identity \u2014 a kind of digital passport \u2014 for all possible applications. In our city, we do not want this digital ID to be centralized but on the blockchain. We only verify and confirm the identity of a person,\u201d Dolfi M\u00fcller, the mayor of Zug, said in a statement.\nAccording to the mayor, blockchain-based identity applications should not be limited to urban services, fee collection or room rentals. In the first phase of the digital ID, a consultative \u201ce-vote\u201d will be held to determine the usage of the innovative system. The voting is expected to take place in the spring of 2018.\nThe Ethereum-based digital identity application is being developed by the Institute for Financial Services Zug (IFZ) of the Lucerne University, Zug-based ConsenSys \u00a0and the Z\u00fcrich-based ti&m.\n\"Today, our digital identity still lies with major search engines and social networks that profit from it. A self-managed, secure and certified identity is indispensable for the functioning of an increasingly digital society. For the Crypto Valley Zug, we believe in a research collaboration with the financial sector and government agencies,\u201d Mathias Bucher, lecturer at the IFZ, said.\n\"This pioneering project is technically highly interesting and fits perfectly with the competencies of our company: digitize with the greatest possible security and great user-friendliness,\u201d Mr. Bucher added.\nBoth ConsenSys and ti&m expressed their excitement about Zug\u2019s digital identity project. Rouven Heck, Product Lead at ConsenSys, was delighted that the small town chose the ConsenSys web-based wallet and identity management system \u200auPort\u200a to handle the project.\n\u201cBy registering on the public, global Ethereum blockchain, the city of Zug offers its citizens an innovative access for both local and international services,\" said Heck.\nThomas W\u00fcst, Founder and CEO of ti&m, emphasized the high security of the new system.\n\"This solution provides tremendous added value for enhanced security, as private data remains under the full control of individuals while providing a much more streamlined use of digital services,\u201d W\u00fcst said.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 13}

As investors lacking the technical expertise of early market entrants throw their money into cryptocurrency presales, regulatory agencies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cannot be expected to sit on the sidelines much longer.\nEven if regulators do not act, when a presale results in nothing more than profits for its promoter, a disgruntled investor will inevitably make a private securities fraud claim to try and claw back some of their capital; assuming a court will determine a presale of digital tokens to be a private placement of securities, any such federal claim would fall under Rule 10b-5.\nHowever, without conceding the point as to whether digital assets are securities (enough ink has already been spilled on the Howey test), white papers are evolving into documents resembling private placement memoranda typical in a standard Rule 506 private offering of securities. Additionally, a presale purchase agreement is starting to mirror a standard securities purchase agreement. These hybrid documents represent a hedge against current conventional wisdom that digital tokens are not securities.\nDisclosure Is Key\nRather than pulling a set of standard securities offering risk factors and slapping them onto the back of its white paper (increasingly, risk factors are being attached as an exhibit to the technical document), some consensus appears to be emerging among practitioners regarding cryptocurrency risk factors that should be disclosed, including:\nRegulatory risk associated with an undeveloped and emerging body of law both in the United States and internationally;Unexpected transfer restrictions resulting from new regulations;Uncertain tax consequences relating to an investment in digital assets;No guarantee that any digital token will be tradeable on any exchange;Illiquidity and volatility of any cryptocurrency;Potential loss of digital currencies and wallet risks;Malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of Bitcoin or Ethereum protocol;51 percent attack risk with any new cryptocurrency; andFailure to properly incentivize miners.\nAlso, any developer contemplating a presale should take pains to disclose the material risk that the digital token will never make it to an initial coin offering.\nWhile not a blanket defense, a robust recitation of the risks associated with an investment in an ICO could be an important tool in blunting a Rule 10b-5 claim or similar action under associated state securities laws, as it may, among other things, short-circuit the required scienter (i.e., bad intent) element. \u00a0\nGenerally, claims of fraud and misrepresentation are made only after an investment does not perform and are frequently viewed through the lens of \u201c20-20 hindsight.\u201d Including risk factors and other cautionary language in ICO materials can play an important role in staving off liability under the judicial \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine, by warning potential investors about what could go wrong or cause an investment not to perform as anticipated.\nCaveat Emptor: Some Things to Look For\nCounterintuitively, investors should appreciate \u2014 and maybe even ascribe value to \u2014 seeing risk factors. Risk factors can serve as a \u201ccanary in a coal mine\u201d for investors, in a positive sense. Their presence most likely means that a legal team has reviewed the ICO and provided legal diligence and feedback. \nOn the other hand, potential investors should be very concerned if risk factors are not customized for the ICO. In that case, an investor may wonder whether the ICO simply cut and pasted the risk factors for another project. If so, that could be a red flag that the ICO did not get a legal review, or that the counsel reviewing it is unsophisticated with respect to ICOs. \nUntil more clarity emerges around the seminal question of whether digital currencies are securities, expect a continuing creep of legalese into the formally technical documents used in ICOs. It is incumbent on all participants in the process to perform due diligence and understand all risks in order to protect themselves.\nThis article is a guest post by Gray Sasser and Josh Rosenblatt.

Any buy-back volume the markets managed to see was gradually eroded as the overall trend headed downward:\n\nFigure 1: ETH-USD, 4HR Candles, Gemini, Descending Trendline\nAs predicted in last week\u2019s ETH-USD analysis, a failure to see any significant increase in buy volume led the market to see further tests of the Fibonacci Retracement values.

Today\u2019s rejection of the 61% line is not entirely surprising; a lot of volume entered the market upon the arrival of the Double Bottom Reversal from last week, marking a potential turnaround from a strong bear market to a short-lived bull market.

As we continue to test the Fibonacci Retracement values, we can expect to see some turbulence surrounding another test of the 50% and ultimately a test of the 61% values.

He covers topics in healthcare, technology, travel and culture. He holds bitcoin and ether.\nIt\u2019s getting easier all the time to be paid in cryptocurrency. As of Monday, July 3, Bitwage, the Bitcoin payroll and international wage payment service, announced that it is launching services in the U.K. While there might be irony given that earlier this year Bitwage also announced it would offer European Union (EU) IBAN numbers to workers anywhere in the world receiving wages from EU companies, the latest news suggests that the United Kingdom is ready for cryptocurrency. But Bitwage has been saying that for two years.\n\u201cFor domestic workers, we are providing the easiest way for users to obtain digital currencies,\u201d Jonathan Chester, founder and president of Bitwage, told Bitcoin Magazine in a recent interview. \u201cIt is just \u2018set it and forget it,\u2019 as your savings of bitcoin, ether or litecoin increase over time. This is great timing to allow all the new U.K. users that have come into the ecosystem due to the recent price rise.\u201d \nThe Brexit Impact\n\u201cFor international workers, this comes at a good time during the uncertainty of Brexit,\u201d said Chester. \u201cOnce the U.K. leaves the EU, it will be much harder to receive payments from U.K. companies throughout Europe. Our solution will help reduce the cost and delays for workers receiving wages from the U.K., despite the impending consequences of the U.K. leaving the EU.\u201d \nIf Brexit leads to a significant change in the exchange rate, businesses will need to account for the most efficient payment process possible to reduce the likelihood of errors, delays or any other costs within their control. \nAdoption in the Workplace\nWhile entire companies can easily switch their entire workforce payroll onto Bitwage, this scenario is not entirely necessary. Individual employees can create accounts for themselves. \u201cIf someone is interested in getting their wages or a portion [of them] in cryptocurrency, all they have to do is sign up to Bitwage and provide the bank account provided to their employer,\u201d explained Chester. \u201c[Employers] don\u2019t even need to know the difference.\u201d \nHowever, a great way to spread cryptocurrency adoption in the workplace would be to discuss the advantages of Bitcoin with fellow employees and management. As Chester put it, \u201cBitcoin is a much better store of value than gold [because it\u2019s] easier to use and store, and it\u2019s much more scarce. For employees, taking a portion of wages in cryptocurrency would be an investment.\u201d Because users have the option of allocating the portion of their wages that are paid out in crypto versus fiat, it is an easy way to automatically start holding small amounts of cryptocurrencies. \n1. \u00a0Cryptocurrency Lowers International Payment Costs\n\u201cIf you are paying a lot of workers, it is about saving money on wire fees and not being limited on the amount you can send,\u201d said Chester. \u201cSystems that save you money on wire fees, but do not leverage blockchain [technology], have to use a method called \u2018float.\u2019 This essentially means they are holding money in the other country to pay out when they receive the funds and then send a bulk wire to replenish the accounts in the payout country later. These systems have to limit the amount you can send so that they do not run out of funds to pay out. This is not the case with blockchain [technology].\u201d\nChester said that, before announcing its U.K. launch, several U.K. companies had approached Bitwage, hoping to use their service to pay workers in the Philippines. They wanted a way to save money on wire fees, save their workers money on exchange rates and remove limits on the amount of money that can be sent.\n2. Optionality Is a Powerful Marketing and Recruiting Tool\nFor many people, particularly millennials, having options can be a legitimate benefit. Offering employees more options for how they want their wages paid out is empowering. Furthermore, it signifies trust between employee and employer. \nBitwage can also receive and pay out in a wide range of other currencies such as gold, silver, USD, Euros, GBP, BRL, PHP, INR, MXN, ARS, VND, NGN and UAH. Choice of currency could be a formidable recruiting tool to attract a much wider pool of talent. For instance, international employees, the unbanked, gold bugs, silverites and of course the crypto community might appreciate the option of getting paid in the currency of their choice. \nChester pointed out that once more than 50 percent of employees at a business are getting paid in cryptocurrency, an employer might even decide to provide an incentive package \u201clike a bitcoin 401k.\u201d \u00a0\nIt is important to note, however, that once businesses receive bitcoins from a Bitcoin transaction, it becomes that entity\u2019s responsibility to report capital gains. If a business receives all of their transactions in another designated currency, no additional reporting is required. Before making these choices on the type of payment, payment processor and preferred currency for Bitcoin transactions, and before making any changes to their settlement, it\u2019s a good idea for business owners to discuss their intentions and their options with their accountants.\nFurthermore, employees should pay careful attention to Bitwage\u2019s fee structures, since there are some costs associated with the service.", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 6}

Voorhees described himself as a \u201cbig proponent\u201d of the proposal during his appearance on Epicenter, saying that it\u2019s the \u201conly viable, actual option to moving Bitcoin forward.\u201d\n\u201cI want SegWit on Bitcoin as soon as possible,\u201d said Voorhees. \u201cI also want a hard fork to a larger base block size as soon as possible, and SegWit2x hopefully will make those things happen.\u201d\nVoorhees said that he is also bullish on the possible success of SegWit2x due to the declared support of the proposal from over 80 percent of the network hashrate.\nAccording to Voorhees, the activation of SegWit2x will move Bitcoin out of a \u201ctrough of misery\u201d that he believes the digital cash system has been in for the past two years, though he also believes the deployment of these changes has the potential to cause some volatility in the near term.\n\u201cThis stagnation has been really horrible for Bitcoin,\u201d said Voorhees.\nIn Voorhees\u2019s view, the activation of SegWit2x on the Bitcoin network will lead to a rally in the bitcoin price that \u201cwill be unlike anything that people have ever seen before.\u201d He also believes the activation of the scaling proposal will allow everyone in the ecosystem to refocus on building on top of Bitcoin rather than debating over the base protocol.\nAt one point during his Epicenter interview, Voorhees admitted that he almost doesn\u2019t care which scaling proposal is activated on the network.\n\u201cI just want something to happen,\u201d said Voorhees. \u201cIf this summer fails to find some kind of resolution to this debate, then I\u2019m pretty bearish on bitcoin, and I think it\u2019ll probably be replaced.\u201d\nBitcoin\u2019s Userbase is Much Larger Than /r/Bitcoin\nVoorhees also discussed the Bitcoin community as a whole during his appearance on Epicenter, and he noted that Bitcoin\u2019s userbase is much larger than some may realize.\n\u201cThe community is so much larger than Reddit, and people that live on Reddit don\u2019t realize this,\u201d said Voorhees.\nWhile the /r/Bitcoin subreddit is still a main hub of the community, Voorhees pointed out that both Blockchain and Coinbase have 10 million users each. By comparison, /r/Bitcoin has roughly 250,000 subscribers.\nVoorhees then told a story of going to a recent Bitcoin meetup in Berlin, Germany, where Blockchain CEO Peter Smith asked the audience how many of them had heard of the SegWit2x proposal. According to Voorhees, about 5 percent of the crowd raised their hands.\nDoes Bitcoin Need a Better System of Governance?\nVoorhees\u2019s story about the Berlin meetup eventually turned into a broader conversation of how changes should be made to the Bitcoin protocol. Crain pointed out that some of the newer altcoins coming onto the market, such as Tezos, are heavily focused on the issue of network governance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slippery slope,\u201d said Voorhees. \u201cWhen you start having structured governance, you start moving toward an organization that can be compromised. As difficult as Bitcoin has been in making progress on this one debate, it also is showing immense resilience to change, which is good and bad \u2014 it depends what the issue at hand is. You have to be careful if you want something like a blockchain project to turn into a more traditional-looking organization with a hierarchical structure and certain people who make key decisions. That\u2019s not necessarily the best way that a blockchain should exist.\u201d\nVoorhees then admitted that he does not know the best governance model for a blockchain, but he thinks it\u2019s great that there is so much experimentation taking place in this area right now.\nWatch the whole episode here in which Voorhees also talks about investment in the crypto space, the future of Shapeshift and its new Prism platform:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 6}

Hyperledger Iroha is an open-source blockchain software that allows users to store and transfer data as well as develop smart contracts, which makes it suitable for the development of digital payment systems. \nHowever, the National Bank of Cambodia stated that it is not focusing on creating a new digital currency at this point. Instead, the new blockchain trial will aim to reduce the costs in Cambodia\u2019s interbank lending market, according to a local news publication. \n\u201cWe expect the new technology to provide smooth, efficient, safe and affordable interbank transactions which will ultimately benefit end users. At this stage we will focus on the operational functionality of the system, but we believe the system can further be customized with application development to benefit the [central] bank\u2019s monetary policy, including the use of the local currency,\u201d NBC Director-General Chea Serey told the Phnom Penh Post.\nHaving said that, Serey also mentioned that \u201ca cashless system is less costly and more transparent for the whole economy. This has always been on our agenda, but we needed time to study the different platforms available,\u201d suggesting that a digital Cambodian riel is not off the table in the future. \nSerey further added that the National Bank of Cambodia\u2019s motivation for developing blockchain solutions is to give the central bank greater control over the country\u2019s monetary policy, which is constrained by the Kingdom\u2019s heavy use of the U.S. dollar. \nCentral Banks Around the World Look to the Blockchain\nThe National Bank of Cambodia is not the only central bank looking at possible implementation of blockchain technology. \nThe People\u2019s Bank of China, for example, announced in January that it has completed a blockchain trial for a new Chinese digital currency by digitizing the Chinese yuan and transacting with a range local banks. The Canadian central bank, the Bank of Canada, is also interested in what blockchain technology can offer, having run a similar trial to test blockchain-based digitized fiat currency for interbank payments. \nThe Bank of England is also exploring blockchain opportunities through its multi-year research program that explores the implication of central banks issuing digital currencies. For Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, the most interesting use case for blockchain technology is the securities settlement process. He called it \u201cripe for innovation.\u201d\n\u201cA typical settlement chain involves many intermediaries, making it comparatively slow and keeping operational risks high. Industry has begun to work together to determine how distributed ledger technologies could be used to solve these issues at scale,\u201d Carney added, speaking at a fintech conference in London in April. \nGiven the number of blockchain trials that central banks are conducting across the globe, it will not be surprising to see a wave of digitization of fiat currencies taking place in the years to come.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 22}
{"title": "Op Ed: How Cryptocurrency Holders Can Diversify While Deferring Taxes", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/quasi-charitable-trusts-how-cryptocurrency-holders-can-diversify-while-deferring-taxes2/", "birthday": "Jun 21, 2017 10:33 AM EST", "date": "2017-06-21 15:33:00", "content": "With the historic rally in Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are more investors than ever seeking to diversify their newly expanded cryptocurrency holdings. Whether this diversification involves exchanging cryptocurrency for fiat, other cryptocurrencies or a mix of both, the downside can be capital gains tax exposure.\nCapital gains (if the underlying property has been held for over a year) are taxed at 15 percent, 18.8 percent or 23.8 percent, dependent upon the amount of income received during the year. One common method of tax reduction is to spread sales/exchanges over multiple years, in order to \u201csoak up\u201d the maximum amount of income into the 15 percent and 18.8 percent brackets.\nIf you're seeking to diversify, it\u2019s really only practical to spread sales over a few years at most. But what if there were a way to sell immediately while still deferring this capital gains income over a much longer period, such as 20 years or even a lifetime? And what if this method were able to also provide some benefit to charity, with a corresponding charitable deduction?\nEnter the Charitable Remainder Trust\nThis can actually be done with a quasi-charitable trust, namely a charitable remainder trust. With a charitable remainder trust, you contribute some amount of your cryptocurrency to a trust before selling. The trust then sells the cryptocurrency (or otherwise diversifies) on a completely tax-free basis. The proceeds of sale stay within the trust, where they can be reinvested in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, other cryptocurrency or almost any other investment asset.\nIn exchange for your contribution of cryptocurrency, the trust makes a payment to you each year for so long as you are alive. (You can alternatively choose to have the payment made for the joint lives of you and your spouse, or some shorter fixed term of years.) You choose the amount of this annual payment at the time you create the trust. \nThe whole process is sort of like receiving an annuity in exchange for your cryptocurrency. This payment can be a fixed amount, or it can be expressed as a fluctuating percentage of trust assets each year. When you pass away, whatever is left passes to a charity of your choice.\nThere are numerous tax benefits:\nThe sale or exchange of cryptocurrency is completely tax-free.You personally only pay tax each year on the annual payment you receive from the trust. So if you use a charitable remainder trust to sell $5M of Bitcoin in 2017, but your annual payment for the rest of your life is $250,000 per year, then you only pay tax on $250,000 in 2017. This payment would be taxed at favorable capital gains rates. Depending on the amount of your other annual income, this strategy will likely keep you in the lower capital gains brackets.In the year of trust creation, you receive an income tax deduction equal to the actuarial value of the charity\u2019s projected gift. This actuarial value is a calculation done by your attorney-CPA. The smaller the payment you select, the larger the charitable deduction. Assuming you choose an appropriate charity, the deduction can be used to reduce up to 30 percent of your income in a given year, and any unusable amount carries forward for up to five future years. For example, if a 42-year-old man were to contribute $2.5M of cryptocurrency to a charitable remainder trust in 2017 and selected an annual payment equal to 5 percent of trust assets, he would receive a charitable deduction of approximately $480,000 (at current IRS rates). That deduction could be used against his taxable income in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\nYou can even reserve the right to serve as trustee of the trust and to change the charitable remainder beneficiary whenever you please.\nThere are of course many technical caveats that need to be complied with. Most important, the IRS requires that the actuarial value of the charity\u2019s share must be at least 10 percent of the assets contributed to the trust. Be sure to consult with appropriate counsel to ensure you meet the 10 percent rule and other technical requirements. \nIf you are looking to reduce and defer income taxes while keeping a guaranteed income for life and doing some good in the process, a charitable remainder trust can be the way to go.\nThis article is a guest post by Jeff Vandrew Jr. It does not necessarily reflect the views of BTC Media or Bitcoin Magazine and is for general information purposes only; it should not be taken as investment advice.

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nOne of the biggest stories in cryptocurrency over the past couple of months has been the meteoric rise of the ether price and the speculative frenzy around the Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) launching on top of the Ethereum platform. In a recent video uploaded to his personal YouTube channel, Dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer shared some of his thoughts on ICOs and their effect on the ether price.\n\u201cThe real reason the [ether] price has been going up something like a hundred dollars per week for the past month is really just greed: greed from developers, greed from investors [and] greed from everybody in this speculative market,\u201d said Palmer in a summary of his main point on the topic of Ethereum and ICOs. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. People making money is how the world works. But it\u2019s the way in which it\u2019s been happening and the speed at which people have been doing these ICOs that is a little bit concerning.\u201d\nThis Is Not Our First Rodeo with ICOs\nBefore getting into the details of the current speculative bubble around ICOs, Palmer pointed out that this is not the cryptocurrency community\u2019s first rodeo when it comes to these sorts of token sales and speculative investment opportunities.\nAs specific examples of past token sales from an earlier time, Palmer pointed to Mastercoin (now Omni) and Ethereum itself. \nThen there was Havelock Investments, \u201cliterally a platform where you could buy securities or invest and get equity in a company based on bitcoin,\u201d added Palmer.\nIn addition to Havelock Investments, public offerings for investment were also made on platforms such as Bitfunder, BTC-TC and GLBSE.\nPalmer also brought up several infamous cases of bad investments or outright scams from the past.\nHe discussed Neo & Bee, a startup that failed in spectacular fashion after raising funds through various bitcoin-based stock exchanges. Cyprus eventually issued an arrest warrant for Neo & Bee CEO Danny Brewster.\nThen Palmer also recalled the infamous case of Josh Garza and his schemes related to cloud mining and the altcoin known as Paycoin.\n\u201cThey launched a coin that was literally just a token to facilitate their Ponzi scheme,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cAnd they would actually sell a product that didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nWhy Are We Seeing a Flurry of ICOs Right Now?\nSo, if these sorts of schemes have existed in the past, why are we seeing a boom around the concept today? In Palmer\u2019s view, Ethereum\u2019s ERC20 token standard has made it easier for anyone to launch a token sale on their own.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s so easy and a standard to copy, there\u2019s been a lot of people that can just fire up an ICO in a couple of minutes,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cThere\u2019s actually a couple of websites out there that\u2019ll let you generate an ICO or generate a token on Ethereum with no coding required.\u201d\nAlthough previous token sales did not involve much more than a Bitcoin address and a spreadsheet, Palmer said there\u2019s something more tangible about the process on Ethereum.\n\u201cSomething that is more tangible about Ethereum ICOs is that when you send the ether to the contract, the Ethereum network does recognize \u2014 and many wallets out there because of the ERC20 standard will recognize \u2014 that you got whatever coin or whatever token shows up in your wallet,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cSo, it\u2019s a lot more tangible. You\u2019re not just sending money somewhere and never hearing about it again.\u201d\nPalmer added that developers need to take a step back and question whether it\u2019s right for them to raise $150 million for their \u201clittle startup.\u201d As a comparison, Palmer noted that normal seed round funding for a startup is between half a million to a million dollars.\n\u201cMany of them don\u2019t even have a tangible product yet,\u201d claimed Palmer.\nWhile Palmer\u2019s video casted a cautious tone over the entire ICO market, he did mention Status.im and Civic as two projects with legitimate, tangible technology behind them.\nHow Are These ICOs Affecting the Price of Ether?\nAnother aspect of the speculation around Ethereum-based ICOs is the effect these digital assets have had on the price of ether. There\u2019s been a flurry of ICOs launched on the platform in the past few months, with some projects raising over $100 million in a matter of minutes.\n\u201cWhen [an ICO is launched], the only way to buy into these ERC20 contracts or these ICOs is through ether or Ethereum, so if these companies are raising $150 million in ether, that\u2019s locking that ether up in that contract,\u201d said Palmer. \u201cAnd so, it\u2019s taking that money off the market. So, what happens is you have this shortened supply, but there\u2019s an ICO coming on the market every single week. And so, people are getting really excited about this and trying to buy up ether.\n\u201cThis is what\u2019s really happening,\u201d Palmer continued. \u201cThis is what\u2019s driving the bulk of the [ether] purchases and trade right now is people buying ether to send to a contract in the hope they\u2019ll get rich quick off one of these ICOs.\u201d\nIn Palmer\u2019s view, the speculative boom and FOMO driven by the ICO market has spilled out into the entire cryptocurrency market.\nWatch the full video here:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 21}

He is enamored with blockchain technology and passionate about bringing Bitcoin and decentralized systems to the technological vanguard.\nThe United States Senate has introduced a bill that would require all travelers entering the U.S. to declare digital currency holdings in excess of $10,000. Despite concerns raised by the invasive nature of the bill, the likelihood of it being passed is extremely low simply due to the incredibly challenging infrastructure that would be required.\nIn fact, the new bill is actually a reintroduction of an older bill that was originally introduced in 2011. The 2011 bill never made it out of sub-committee deliberation. \nSpeaking about the recent legislation development, David Siegel, founder of Twenty Thirty AG and Bitcoin enthusiast, tells Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing. It\u2019s a step back toward 1934.\u201d \nThe bill would require the Secretary of Homeland Secretary and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner to submit a joint report to Congress withinthat meets the following two conditions over 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act:\n\n\u201c(1) detailing a strategy to interdict and detect prepaid access devices, digital currencies, or other similar instruments, at border crossings and other ports of entry for the United States; and;\n(2) that includes an assessment of infrastructure needed to carry out the strategy ...\u201d\n\nThe amount of technology that would have to be developed in order to enforce this law is incredible. How could they detect these crypto assets? The infrastructure investment that would be needed would be quite prodigious. \n\u201cMy position on regulation is that there should be strong evidence supporting its effectiveness,\u201d says Siegel. \u201cI don\u2019t see declaring moving money as a transparency issue, so I would say it\u2019s a strong step in the wrong direction. I think regulation should be scaled way back to the point where we can show it\u2019s actually better than no regulation.\u201d \nThe bill, S.1241, would add \u201cprepaid access devices\u201d under the definition of U.S. monetary instruments in section 5312, title 31, of the U.S. Code. Specifically, a \u201c\u2018prepaid access device\u2019 means an electronic device or vehicle, such as a card, plate, code, number, electronic serial number, mobile identification number, personal identification number, or other instrument, that provides a portal to funds or the value of funds that have been paid in advance and can be retrievable and transferable at some point in the future.\u201d\nThese prepaid access devices, in theory, could extend to include electronic ledgers, cryptocurrency wallets and even private keys. These are all portals where individuals can gain access to their private funds. Thus, individuals with more than $10,000 worth of crypto assets tied up on the blockchain would have to declare their crypto net worth to the U.S. Government by filling out a Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments, often called the FinCEN105. This could have a serious impact on digital currency holders traveling to the United States. Punishment for not reporting could include up to five years of jail time and forfeiture of those funds in the form of criminal and civilian penalties.\nFormally known as the \u201cCombating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017,\u201d the bill was introduced on May 25, 2017, by Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and is co-sponsored by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), John Cornyn (R-TX) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). It has been referred to the Committee on the Judiciary for further deliberation, but has a tremendous number of obstacles that must be overcome before reaching the President\u2019s desk for final approval.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 22}

Data from the professional networking site LinkedIn has shown that blockchain related job postings have tripled in the last 12 months. This shows that there is a high demand for blockchain experts as the potential and applicability of blockchain technology becomes more apparent to corporations. Recognizing this opportunity, several universities have added blockchain studies to their fields of study to tailor their educational offerings to these new developments in the job market.\nThe University of Edinburgh, for example, has recently announced the launch of a blockchain technology laboratory within its School of Informatics through a collaboration with technology startup Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK). The new lab will focus primarily on blockchain studies. However, related interdisciplinary research will be also encouraged. \nSpeaking at the launch of the blockchain technology lab, IOHK Co-Founder, Jeremy Wood stated: \u201cIOHK\u2019s partnership with the University of Edinburgh provides unique opportunities for current students to become the next generation of blockchain and cryptography leaders.

Stanford University began offering a course on cryptocurrencies, blockchains and smart contracts two years ago, while the University of California, Berkeley also offers a blockchain course.\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is in the process of developing a course on the subject matter, while the University of Nicosia in Cyprus is offering the world\u2019s first MSc in Digital Currency. The master's degree covers all key areas of digital currencies such as regulation, cryptography and blockchain technology applications. Students can even pay the tuition fees for the degree in bitcoin. \nThere are also a number of online courses created to cater to the rising demand for blockchain expertise. Princeton University has partnered with online learning platform Coursera to provide an intensive 11-week course on bitcoin and cryptocurrency technology.\nThe Blockchain University and the B9lab also offer blockchain and cryptocurrency courses designed to cater to professionals who are seeking to improve their knowledge and have a competitive edge in the industry. \nThe CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4) includes Andreas Antonopoulos, Vitalik Buterin, Pamela Morgan, Josh McDougall and Michael Perklin on its board of directors. It offers cryptocurrency courses and provides participants with professional certificates upon completion. Certified Bitcoin Professional (CBP), Certified Bitcoin Expert (CBE), and Certified Ethereum Developer (CED) are the three professional certifications available. \nThe rise in blockchain related courses both online and in leading educational institutions is a testament to growing confidence in the technology's ability to disrupt industry in the future.

This occurrence comes on the heels of Ulbricht\u2019s latest appeal for release which was just denied in May.\nA Twitter message from @free_ross dated June 15, 2017, created a bit of a social media firestorm. In it, his mother Lyn Ulbricht wrote:\n\n\n.@Coinbase disabled the #FreeRoss account after receiving 16.5 #Bitcoin this morning. We need that for Ross' defense.\u2014 Free_Ross (@Free_Ross) June 15, 2017\n\n\nLater that day, Ulbricht confirmed that the Free Ross account on Coinbase had been re-enabled. In an email to Bitcoin Magazine, she remarked \u201cI think they responded promptly because of the uproar on social media. We are not so sure of their explanation of why it happened and are looking into the record on that now.\u201d \nLater she responded, \u201cThey [Coinbase] said it was an automatic security response.\u201d \nThe Free Ross account does not store all of its bitcoins on Coinbase. Rather, it was established as a convenient way to convert donations into U.S. dollars. \nThis recent hiccup comes as Coinbase, perhaps the world\u2019s most popular bitcoin exchange, continues to face a litany of complaints from users. There have been numerous reports that the exchange shutters user accounts without reason or notice. \u00a0It has been alleged that Coinbase frequently flags and freezes accounts when even the smallest hint of suspicious activity is suspected. In some cases, there have been complaints among users saying that any coins they had in the account at the time were never returned to them. \nIn a Coinbase blog post on June 4, CEO Brian Armstrong acknowledged the need for changes to address the negative customer experiences, which he attributed to growing demands on the Coinbase system.\nWe\u2019re storing customer funds, and I can understand how incredibly frustrating (and scary) it is when an issue arises and you can\u2019t get a prompt response. We haven\u2019t done enough to keep up with the growth, and we\u2019re taking steps now to correct it. - Brian Armstrong\n\u00a0Armstrong also set forth a plan to address some of the scaling solutions that Coinbase plans to implement later this year, including faster customer support response times and a new system to flag \u201crisky withdrawals.\u201d He indicated that the company has hired a consultant to consult on scaling and the introduction of phone support.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to both Coinbase and Armstrong about the company\u2019s continuing service woes in light of the problems with the FreeRoss account. In response to our questions, Megan Hernbroth from the strategic communications department at Coinbase, stated, \u201cThis account was initially blocked due to automated security feature because of the links between this account and a previously compromised one,\u201d and referred us to the following Tweet:\n\n\n.@coinbase has enabled #FreeRoss account. Was auto security response to possible link to previous compromised account. Never happened b4.\u2014 Free_Ross (@Free_Ross) June 16, 2017\n\n\nShe also referred us back to the June 4th blog post in lieu of comment on Coinbase\u2019s other service concerns.\nRegulatory Challenges and a New Hire\nIn a recent announcement on its blog, Coinbase announced that former federal prosecutor Kathryn Haun would be joining its Board of Directors. Haun was the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s first-ever digital currency head and was tasked with addressing financial, cyber-crime, gang and national security concerns. \nAmong the investigations that she oversaw were those that led to the prosecution of the two federal agents accused of theft and corruption in the Silk Road case. Both are currently serving prison sentences. \nReports that Haun would be assisting Coinbase did not sit well with many in the Bitcoin community. And the fact that her appointment occurred the day after the Free Ross account was suspended was a hot topic of discussion on sites like Reddit. \nIt should be noted that given its rise in prominence as the leading bitcoin exchange in the U.S., Coinbase has been experiencing a flurry of regulatory scrutiny over the past 18 months. According to the Coinbase site, it is registered as a Money Services Business with FinCEN; as such, it is subject to stringent anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance requirements in addition to state laws.\nIn a major development which occurred last year on this front, the IRS requested a John Doe summons as part of a bitcoin probe, seeking to identify and capture Coinbase user information in the U.S. associated with someone who conducted transactions in the digital currency. \nOn the regulatory front, a bill being pursued in Congress called the \u201cCombating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017\u201d seeks to, among other things, further target exchanges like Coinbase under the strictures of anti-money laundering regulations. Moreover, Congress is considering including cryptocurrency holdings over $10,000 on the list of reporting requirements when travelers are entering or leaving the U.S.\nWhen asked about Coinbase amid this onslaught of regulatory activity, Perry Woodin, a computer engineer and CEO of the blockchain governance company, Node40 had this to say: \u201cI suspect that Coinbase is suffering from the growing pains of being the leader in a rapidly evolving industry. Add to that growth, a changing states-based regulatory scene that requires Coinbase to jump through ever changing hoops, and customer service is bound to suffer. Coinbase has reported issues where Wyoming, Hawaii and Minnesota have overly burdensome regulations, forcing the exchange to withdraw from those states.\u201d \u00a0\nIssues Persist\nAs Armstrong asserted in his blog post, some of the technical and service issues facing Coinbase may be attributed to the increasing demand they\u2019re facing amid the meteoric rise taking place in the cryptocurrency world. Nevertheless, concerns abound about frequent outages that throttle buy and sell orders, often for extended periods of time. There have also been instances during these major price movement periods where the Coinbase site couldn\u2019t be accessed at all. \nLamented libertarian singer and songwriter Tatiana Moroz: \u201cI have had countless problems with Coinbase, from repeated errors on the platform to it not being accessible when I\u2019ve needed to sell or buy bitcoin most. It's not a few isolated incidents; it's ongoing.\u201d \nMoroz went on to say that Coinbase\u2019s customer service has basically been nothing short of a \u201cnightmare.\u201d \n\u201cIt makes me feel completely uncared for as a customer and I know I'm not the only one. I have sent service tickets that take 2-3 weeks for them to reply to. Their fees are also high. And there never seems to be a way to reach a human, which is very scary when you have your money there.\u201d \u00a0\nThe Reddit post seems to underscore the frustration experienced by Moroz and scores of others regarding user experience snafus. \n\u201cUnfortunately, the subpar tier one support can cause angst that rapidly spreads across social media,\u201d said Woodin. \u201cI don\u2019t know what recourse there is for users who have lost coins. I do hope that, as Coinbase continues to grow and expand, that they put more emphasis on customer support and service. Doing so will save Coinbase and their customers from unnecessary headaches.\u201d \nLack of Options\nWoodin also points to a frequently overlooked, central issue in this discussion, namely, the lack of \u00a0consumer choice and competition in terms of exchanges currently in the markets. He attributes this in large part to expense and regulatory climate factors associated with launching a new exchange. \n\u201cNo doubt, it can be prohibitively expensive to meet the licensing requirements imposed by many states. Movement of fiat currency is highly regulated which means any competition coming to market would have a high financial burden for compliance. I do not see this changing anytime soon.\u201d \nMoroz echoed this notion, surmising that Coinbase\u2019s troubles are in part regulatory in nature: \u201cWhat's troubling is that the regulations and other barriers to entry allow it to operate as a monopoly essentially, and it's difficult to avoid using them if convenience is a factor. I\u2019d like to also note that they seem to have a presence at so few of the major conferences. Frankly, this makes me wonder about how supportive they are of the Bitcoin community in the first place.\u201d \u00a0\nLibertarian economist and free-market advocate Jeffrey Tucker, in conversation Bitcoin Magazine, also weighed in with a final thought: \u201cThe fact is that there should be tens of thousands of exchanges. And there were scores that were already opening up before government intervened and forced all of these regulations on everybody. And, of course, that created a cartelized market with only a handful of players dominating everything. That allows them to exploit their customers by raising rates, by providing inferior service, not innovating. Currently, the exchange business is a non-competitive sector that, in my view, is a disaster for Bitcoin.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 20}

Bitcoin Schmitcoin became popular within the subculture of the Reddit communities and now posts his daily thoughts and market outlook via Twitter and his regular stream on Twitch.tv.\nBitcoin Schmitcoin on Twitch.tv\n\nBitcoin Schmitcoin: YouTube\nA few days ago, just before a 25% market pullback, ETH-USD reached all-time high values upward of $420 as ICO investors desperately tried to accumulate ether to purchase Bancor tokens. The Bancor ICO was single-handedly responsible for congesting the Ethereum networks as users scrambled to get their ICO orders in time. This created a scenario where individuals were spending large sums of ETH to expedite their transactions and push other transaction times further and further back \u2014 the sheer volume of which could not be handled by many exchanges and wallets.\n\nFigure 1: Coinbase Ethereum Transactions Delayed\nAcross multiple exchanges, messages like the one above began popping up yesterday as the perfect storm of ICO congestion from \u201cStatus\u201d met a flood of ETH being sold off to BTC via the ETH-BTC markets (shown in yellow in the figure below). At the time of this article, the aftermath of the Status ICO is still being felt as many wallets and exchanges still have Ether-related services disabled. \nFigure 2: ETH-BTC, 1 HR Candles, GDAX\nOnce the services begin to open up and allow cold storage holders to get their coins on the market, one can only speculate how far the price will continue to be pushed down. Given the long-term, bearish indicators on the ETH-USD markets, it is entirely possible that we will see further tests of the lower support levels (shown in brown). The relatively low volume on this recent dip indicates the real price action has yet to truly begin. Because of the backlogged transactions from the Status ICO event, the volume we have seen thus far has mostly likely only been by those who held their coins on the exchange. The MACD and RSI (indicators of market momentum) are showing no sign of divergence (market momentum reversal) and there is very little upward pressure to keep the price aloft.\n\nFigure 3: ETH-USD, 6 HR Candles, GDAX\nWhere the bottom of this bear run truly lies remains to be seen. However, for the first time since the double-digit values, the 1-day candles are showing a bearish trend on the MACD (shown in purple), and the RSI is showing a loss of momentum (divergence shown in orange). As it stands, ETH-USD is sitting on the first Fibonacci Retracement Line at ~$315 where it is flirting with the idea of lower values. \n\nFigure 4: ETH-USD, 1 Day Candles, Kraken\nBancor and Status set record transaction volumes and accumulated millions of USD in the form of ETH. Is $300 the bottom of this Bear Run? Maybe. But one has to ask, \u201cWhat would you do if you just had two of the largest ICOs in history, where the value of the ETH used to fund your project is at all time high values? Would you watch your capital dwindle away under bearish conditions, or would you cash out?\"\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The developers also highlighted the strengths of their advanced smart contract code, which will support decentralized commerce, digital identities and the digitization of many different assets. This rebranding of Antshares represents a new direction for the development of China's blockchain community.\nCurrently, holders of ANS can now automatically generate Antcoins (ANC) in their Antshares wallets, which will be used as gas on the platform. The ANS asset symbol will become NEO in the 3rd quarter of 2017; meanwhile, the NEO team is working on new clients and a UI for the new NEO brand.\nThroughout the day, there were presentations from participants including Microsoft representatives, NEO platform developers, and founders of partner platforms. Among the select attendees were several major potential investors, industry experts and blockchain enthusiasts, as well as members of the Chinese financial and mainstream media.\n \nPresenters at the conference included:\u00a0\nDa Hongfei, founder of NEO\nAfter announcing NEO\u2019s new brand and strategy, Da Hongfei elaborated on the future of blockchain technology, where every asset will be digitized and programmable with smart contracts. Calling for the transparency and openness of data, he introduced concepts of the \u201cSmart Economy\u201d and new smart contract system, and announced that he is building a new multi-chain protocol for interoperability.\nDa Hongfei\u2019s top revelations at the conference were that:\nNEO is collaborating with certificate authorities in China to map real-world assets using smart contracts;NEO has received a new patent for cross-chain distributed interoperability;NEO\u2019s recent new startup partners include Bancor, Agrello, Coindash, Nest Fund, and Binance, with more partner announcements to come.\nErik Zhang, Core Developer of NEO\nIn his presentation, Erik Zhang discussed the evolution of Smart Contracts 2.0, and explained the main differences between NEO and Ethereum. One big contrast of these competing platforms is their programming languages. Ethereum requires developers to learn to program with Solidity. Neo, on the other hand, will support almost all programming languages via a compiler, including those on Microsoft.net, Java, Kotlin, Go and Python, greatly lowering the difficulty for developers to write smart contracts. By making its programming languages more inclusive, NEO hopes to attract a larger community of developers. Zhang also explained the mechanics of the NEO Virtual Machine, its execution engine and interoperability. \u00a0\n\nSlide Of The NEO Virtual Machine \nTony Tao, CEO of NEO and Founder of Nest Fund\nBased on the concept of Ethereum\u2019s The DAO, a blockchain-based investment fund, Tony Tao is about to release a whitepaper for a similar project. Called Nest Fund, and built on NEO\u2019s blockchain, this fund will make improvements on the failures of The DAO. By offering a global bounty reward for any hacker who finds bugs, Nest will be audited by a worldwide peer review, and will then release its token for decentralized investing.\nSrikanth Raju, Microsoft\u2019s G.M of Developer Experience and Evangelism for the Greater China Region\u00a0\nAccording to Mr. Raju, blockchain technology will lead us into a new digital age, displacing traditional businesses and middlemen throughout many industries. He said that Onchain (the company that founded NEO) is \u201cone of the top 50 startup companies in China\u201d, and offered his support for their endeavors going forward.\n\u00a0Mr. Han Feng, Tsinghua University I-Center\u00a0\nFostering innovation and entrepreneurship at the top university in China, Tsinghua University\u2019s I-Center focuses on the large-scale integration of technology resources. Speaking for the university\u2019s growing interest in supporting blockchain technology, Mr. Han Feng said that current systems of commerce are \u201coutdated and insecure,\u201d and that the internet is ready for an upgrade to a blockchain-based operating system. Calling for a fully-automated, blockchain-based, decentralized economy, he said we can expect a digital revolution in the years to come. This will include digital currency, decentralized storage, secure smart contract codes, IoT, AI, and many more innovations.\n\u00a0Chen Cheng Qiang, founder and CEO of Innospace\nLocated in Shanghai, Innospace is a business incubation company, with office spaces, meeting spaces, cafes and living spaces. At today\u2019s conference, Innospace CEO Chen Cheng Qiang announced a \u00a5200 million CNY ($29.3 million USD) incubation fund, a collaboration between his company and the NEO blockchain team. Plans for the fund include the establishment of a new blockchain space in Shanghai, combining working spaces, startup incubation and acceleration services. According to Mr. Qiang, his company plans to provide the most successful entrepreneurship acceleration services in China.\n\u00a0Alex Norta, founder of Agrello\nComing all the way from Estonia, Alex Norta announced that his startup Agrello will be partnering with NEO to develop smart contracts for automation, self-execution, accuracy and transparency. Powered by AI, Agrello will be a platform for non-programmers to create their own legally binding blockchain-based smart contracts. Use cases for Agrello\u2019s tech include renting and sharing, freelance contracting, orchestrating production flows, and reducing administration costs for multinational corporations.\nAdam Efrima, COO of Coindash\nWith offices in Israel and Shanghai, Coindash will be a social trading platform for crypto assets, offering portfolio management tools for digital asset investors. Features of the platform will include portfolio statistics and management tools, investment automation, an ICO dashboard, and insights into other traders\u2019 successful investing strategies. In the upcoming development of Nest Fund, a blockchain-based smart fund by the developers of NEO, Coindash will offer advisory and prediction tools for Nest\u2019s modern investors.\nMr. Zhao Chang Peng, CEO of Binance\u00a0\nThe former CTO of OkCoin, Mr. Zhao Chang Peng is starting his own digital asset exchange, hoping to compete with platforms like Poloniex. Calling his new platform Binance, this new exchange will only deal in coin-to-coin transactions, avoiding fiat pairs and therefore avoiding Chinese regulations. In order to maintain a standard in mature digital assets, Binance will only list coins that meet its strict criteria. With a launch planned for later this year, the platform\u2019s first traded assets will be bitcoin, ether and NEO.\u00a0\n\n\nFrom the looks, sounds, and energy of the event, NEO has built up some strong momentum going forward. They have one the top blockchain development teams in all of China, with 50 million ANS ($325 million) to support their funding needs and a growing list of partners now aligning by their side. While it may take some time to steal the spotlight from Ethereum, we are sure to see more from this platform in the months to come. \u00a0", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 23}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nA mixed crowd of denim jeans and custom-tailored suits, typical for crypto-events, is standing across the vertical aisle of the the main conference area at the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference in Saint Petersburg, blocking the line of sight for those lucky enough to have snatched themselves a chair in the back. The hall, while spacious \u2014 high ceiling, tall arched windows partly covered with ASIC mining billboards \u2014 still isn\u2019t quite large enough to fit all interested visitors.\nThe speaker on stage works for Alfa Bank, one of the biggest banks in Russia. The financial sector in the former Soviet block is taking as much interest in Bitcoin and, of course, blockchain technology as anywhere else is. Having skipped Russia\u2019s second-biggest city for the past two years, Smile-Expo re-introduced its Eastern European conference tour in Saint Petersburg last Thursday.\n\u201cThe event had over 600 visitors, 25 exhibitors and some 20 speakers. Four of those work for Russia\u2019s largest financial institutions,\u201d event organizer Pavel Likhomanov told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cEntrepreneurs and finance professionals are increasingly taking this technology seriously. This is evident from the turn-up here in Saint Petersburg; and we\u2019ve seen year-over-year growth in interest at our Moscow event as well.\u201d\nThis interest is not necessarily self-evident. It was only in 2014 \u2014 indeed, around the time of the last Saint Petersburg conference \u2014 that Russia seemed to emerge as one of the most crypto-hostile nations on the globe. In an attempt to curb criminal activity, the Putin administration introduced draft legislation that would essentially ban any use of cryptocurrencies. Not much later, access to a number of Bitcoin websites, including bitcoin.org, was blocked in the country.\nBut so far, the proposed law has never actually been implemented.\n\u201cBitcoin and cryptocurrencies still have no legal status in Russia,\u201d Artem Tolkachev told Bitcoin Magazine. The director of Deloitte Russia\u2019s legal services for technology projects was one of the headline speakers at the event, where the legal implications of blockchain technology represented a big chunk of the morning program. \n\u201cThe central bank considers cryptocurrency like bitcoin a money surrogate, which is a progressive stance. But the Ministry of Finance is more conservative. They don\u2019t like anything they don\u2019t understand and cannot control,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Russian policymakers are not always very open-minded. They prefer to have their own internet \u2026 their own currency.\u201d\nNeedless to say, Bitcoin is not a great fit in such a worldview.\nThe Thaw\nBut the initial icy stance on digital currencies seems to be getting a bit less frosty these days.\nIt was only a couple of weeks ago that Russian president Vladimir Putin met Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin at the International Economic Forum, also held in Saint Petersburg. In the widely reported event, within the crypto-sphere at least, the president was said to have \u201csupported the idea of establishing ties with possible Russian partners\u201d \u2014 referring to Buterin\u2019s technology pitch. \nThe announcement has been interpreted as a sort of preliminary green light for Russian blockchain entrepreneurs and investors. While not quite an official endorsement from the Kremlin, let alone formal regulation, it\u2019s been a hopeful sign nonetheless.\nBut until it\u2019s official, Russian cryptocurrency users across the halls in the historic Vedensky Hotel, the site of last week\u2019s event, remain reserved.\n\u201cThe Russian market is volatile,\u201d Timur, a former forex trader, told Bitcoin Magazine. He offers a platform that allows Russian brokers to trade on behalf of their clients, Russian cryptocurrency speculators. Speaking from his exhibit stand in Saint Petersburg, he explained: \u201cWe never know for sure if what\u2019s accepted today will be legal tomorrow. Official policy could change at a whim.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why his company sets customers up with foreign bank accounts in Switzerland, or Lithuania, or maybe offshore. The coins themselves \u2014 bitcoin, litecoin, ether \u2014 never leave the exchange where they are traded. \nAnd these exchanges are not in Russia either \u2026 at least not officially. Incorporating abroad is a typical strategy for Russians and their cryptocurrency startups.\nMining\nIt\u2019s not just traders and the finance sector that are taking an interest. Bitcoin mining is growing in Russia too. \nThis is perhaps most evident from the rise of mining pool BitClub Network over the past months. While officially established outside of Russia, the team works from Kazan, a city to the east of Moscow. Already one of the biggest non-Chinese miners on the Bitcoin network, BitClub Network\u2019s founder \u2014 he\u2019s casually wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with an image of Putin \u2014 assured Bitcoin Magazine his will be a top-five pool by the end of the year. At least, that\u2019s what one of his employees translated into English, his smartphone showing videos of data centers full of humming ASIC miners.\nRussian miners are now setting up data centers such as these in the east of Russia, Alex of mining service provider MyRig told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe temperature in Irkoetsk, for example, is ideal for Bitcoin mining: it can be -40 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, electricity is cheap. There\u2019s a big raw material industry, but with the crisis, some factories are out of use. With energy to spare, miners are starting to fill that void.\u201d\nMyRig, a rebranding of Bitmain Warranty (not to be confused with Bitmain), is not the only mining business at the Saint Petersburg conference. The company is vying for attention with several competitors in one of the exhibition rooms. One of them sells entire containers full of equipment, not unlike BitFury\u2019s mobile data centers. Another is re-selling Antminers, the best-selling Bitmain machines.\n\u201cBut to mine bitcoin in Russia at scale, you do still need to have the right connections,\u201d Alex continues. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know your way around local policymakers you risk being shut down.\u201d Though with the increase in profits that the mining sector has seen over the past half year or so, the \u201cbig dicks\u201d are entering the space, Alex said. \u201cThe guys with lots of money \u2014 and lots of connections. I\u2019d expect mining in Russia to continue to grow significantly over the next year.\u201d\nAnd official regulation should be coming too, Deloitte\u2019s Tolkachev said. A draft bill for cryptocurrency should be introduced within a few months, and could be approved by early 2018. This could bring some much-desired regulatory clarity for Russians wanting to open cryptocurrency-related businesses and otherwise openly engage in the industry without needing to work around the existing legal structure.\n\nThat is, visitors in the Vedensky Hotel generally seemed to agree, unless Putin changes his mind.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 27}

Bitcoin Schmitcoin became popular within the subculture of the Reddit communities and now posts his daily thoughts and market outlook via Twitter and his regular stream on Twitch.tv.\nBitcoin Schmitcoin on Twitch.tv\n\nBitcoin Schmitcoin: YouTube\nOver the weekend, BTC-USD market cap dropped from $45 billion to a current (and still falling) market cap of $39 billion. BTC-USD brought the entire crypto market to a screeching halt as traders continued to see devaluations in nearly every tradable coin on the market. So, let\u2019s take a look at what has happened and see just how bad this dive will be for BTC-USD and the other cryptocurrencies.\nOn a macro scale, BTC-USD has been in the process of making a massive Head-and-Shoulders (H&S) pattern on the 6-hour candles:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 6HR Candles, GDAX\nHead and Shoulders are common, highly predictable market reversal patterns. They have well-defined criteria for price movement and price projections once the pattern breaks to the bottom. A H&S pattern is characterized by the following, illustrated above:\nThere is typically an ascending trend line;A left shoulder that is smaller than a central peak (head) and a right shoulder that is smaller than the central peak;The two shoulders are connected by the \u201cNeck Line\u201d of the Head and Shoulders.There is first a test of the ascending trendline. A test and rejection of the ascending trend line\u2019s support will bring us to the test of the neck line.A test of the neck line is usually the ultimate deciding condition for whether or not the pattern will continue downward.\nAt the time of this article, BTC-USD has broken the ascending trend line and is in the process of testing the Neck Line of the H&S pattern. If condition #5 is broken, the price projections are calculated in the\u00a0figure below:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 6HR Candles, GDAX, Price Target for Head and Shoulders\nPrice targets are not guarantees of price movement. Rather, a price target should be used as more of a target \u201czone\u201d rather than a discrete point in the price-space. In our case, BTC-USD happens to have a price target with a very reliable, major support line in the $1800s. Whether BTC-USD drops that far down remains to be seen. However, it is important to note the following in the figure below:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 6HR Candles, GDAX, Steady Downward Momentum\n The momentum indicators, RSI and MACD, are showing no sign of downward momentum loss;The steady downward momentum is coupled with very little relative buy-back volume.\nDuring previous bearish periods, there was a significant increase in buy volume.

Unfortunately, money, power and influence over time have stifled today\u2019s media environment adversely impacting both content producers and consumers alike. \nIn an effort to democratize creative content, DECENT has officially launched its blockchain-based, global media distribution platform. The name is an acronym for Decentralized Network; Encrypted & Secure; Content Distribution System; Elimination of 3rd Parties; New Way of Online Publishing; Timestamped Data Records.\nDesigned to bring more transparency and fairness to the media industry, DECENT allows artists to seamlessly distribute digital content for immediate payment and without hefty fees. Peer-to-peer in its orientation, consumers decide the merits of a certain piece of content posted through a Yelp-like community rating system. The content, however, cannot be censored or removed. \nThis blockchain initiative endeavors to disrupt the legacy world of media distribution by allowing artists more freedom and control over the ownership and distribution of their content, all without compromising on security. It represents a potential gamechanger for the massive global media and content distribution industry \u2014 one that\u2019s estimated to grow from $1.7 trillion in 2016 to over $2 trillion in 2019.\nDECENT was founded in 2016 by two friends, Matej Michalko and Matej Boda, from Slovakia. It sprouted from a shared vision that blockchain technology could fuel a coordinated system of digital content publishing and sharing throughout the world. \nFunding for DECENT was fueled by an ICO campaign last summer, which raised more than 5,881 BTC, at that time valued at $4.2 million USD. There were 4,300 ICO participants in total and no other key funding partners.\nMichalko recounted the journey leading up to his own personal discovery of blockchain technology and its potential uses for the content distribution space. \u201cI\u2019ve been extensively involved in Bitcoin since 2011, even mining it from my own laptop at the beginning. I quickly realized that the innovative technology behind Bitcoin had the potential to change the modern world.\u201d\nWhen Michalko started to delve further into blockchain technology, he found a seemingly endless list of use cases the new technology could support. \u201cI became determined to use blockchain technology to create something revolutionary that would be beneficial for people on a global scale. A short time later ongoing discussions between myself and our future co-founder Matej Boda quickly led to DECENT being born.\u201d \nHe says that DECENT Network is a reaction to the issues that the majority of content producers face nowadays in the entertainment and media industry. \u201cThere is too much artificial complexity and too many barriers in the industry affecting both the access to market and income of the content owners.\u201d \nDECENT\u2019S digital model allows artists to distribute any form of content, including written, music, videos, ebooks and pictures. These distribution channels are free of third-party influence, meaning that artists can also manage their intellectual property rights and set their own pricing. \nOne of the innovative adaptations that distinguishes DECENT from other blockchain platforms is the network\u2019s reputation management system. This allows content creators who share their digital work on the platform to build a lifetime reputation, based on ratings from those who purchase content on the platform. DECENT Network also allows content creators to instantly receive payment when someone downloads their content, without any middleman interference.\nMichalko believes that DECENT can break the trajectory in which a majority of power is concentrated in the hands of a few players controlling the industry. \u201cArtists, filmmakers and writers lose control over their work and depend on the mercy of the \u2018big guys.\u2019 We designed DECENT Network to do away with all that and bring more transparency and fairness to the digital content industry.\u201d\nDECENT estimates that writers, for example, lose a healthy 30\u201375 percent chunk of their earnings when publishing with Amazon. Similarly, musicians, through licensing agreements, lose around 30 percent when selling a track on iTunes. Blockchain technology therefore serves as a mechanism that helps writers and musicians keep more money, while connecting with their audiences directly.\nMichalko says that artists will be paid for their downloaded content through DECENT\u2019s own cryptocurrency called \u201cDCT,\u201d which will be launched together with DECENT Network. Other payment options, he says, will be available in the future. \u201cArtists will no longer have to wait months before seeing a penny from their work. And at the time of launch, DECENT Network will be a completely free-of-charge service for artists.\u201d \nMichalko hopes that by \u00a02020, DECENT Network will have become the number one worldwide media sharing platform. \u201cWe hope to bring more transparency and fairness to the digital content industry for both creators and consumers. I hope that with our launch people will realize the advantage of DECENT Network over other content distribution platforms.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 30}

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nOn June 22, the Federal Bureau of Investigation presented its annual Internet Crime Report for the year of 2016. The FBI analyzed the victim reports at the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) and used the information from their database to publish the annual study. It is important to mention that, according to the Department of Justice\u2019s research, only an estimated 15 percent of the U.S. fraud victims reported their crimes to law enforcement.\nThe FBI highlighted multiple \u201chot topics\u201d regarding internet crimes for the year of 2016. This included Business Email Compromise (BEC), which resulted in the loss of $360 million from victims, currently standing in first place in the category of most damage caused. BEC is a sophisticated scam targeting companies working with international or foreign businesses or suppliers who conduct wire transfer payments at regular intervals.\nRansomware, an emerging \u201cbusiness form\u201d among cyber criminals, was specially mentioned in the report. When launching such attacks, the hackers target electronic devices \u2014 mostly computers and laptops \u2014 with malware that locks up the data of the machines. After the criminals successfully breach the systems of the victims, they demand ransom from them. According to the FBI, in most cases, the ransom is paid in digital currencies, such as bitcoin. In 2016, the IC3 identified 2,673 complaints connected to ransomware attacks, with an estimated loss of over $2.4 million.\nAnother featured sort of internet crime was tech support fraud demanding approximately $7.8 million from the victims. The scam occurs when the criminals impersonate technical support agents from a computer software, security, cable or internet company. After the hackers get in contact with the victims, they convince them to provide remote access to their devices. Once the criminals have control over their systems, additional criminal activity occurs. Multiple companies, including Microsoft and Mozilla, alerted their customers on their websites regarding such fraudulent activities.\nThe IC3 recorded 17,146 cases of extortion with losses over $15 million, which occurred using the internet. By the FBI\u2019s description, in extortion cases, cyber criminals \u201cdemand something of a value from a victim by threatening physical or financial harm or the release of sensitive data.\u201d The agency identified various forms of the crime, including denial of service attacks, hitman schemes, \u201csextortion,\u201d government impersonation schemes, loan schemes and high-profile data breaches. According to the FBI, cyber criminals often demand the payments in cryptocurrencies from the victims, which provides the perpetrators an additional layer of security since they are easy to send but harder to trace.\nCompared to the previous year, the number of reported internet crime cases increased by 3.7 percent in 2016, with the damage caused to the victims rising by $380 million. Excluding the United States, the top five countries affected by internet crime are ranked in the following order: Canada (3,722 cases), India (2,188 cases), the United Kingdom (1,509 cases), Australia (936 cases) and France (568 cases). Among the states of the U.S., California had the most victims (39,547) followed by Texas (21,441) and Florida (21,068).\nThe FBI also compared the age groups affected by internet crime. Victims aged above 60 had the most damage ($339 million) and the most cases (55,043). People between the ages of 30 and 39 had the second most cases (54,670); however, they lost only 56 percent ($190 million) to the criminals compared to those over 60. Young persons under the age of 20 had both the least amount of cases (10,004) and damage ($6.7 million).\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 27}

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nAn ethical hacker breached the database of a phony darknet website offering hitman services and leaked the data. The information from the data dump helped the FBI in their investigation of a man who murdered his wife.\nIn November 2016, Stephen Carl Allwine, 47, of Cottage Grove, Minnesota, killed his wife in \u201cone of the most bizarre cases ever seen,\u201d police officers reported. The husband tried to mask the murder as a suicide, including putting a 9 mm pistol next to Amy Allwine\u2019s elbow. However, detectives arriving on the scene identified the case as murder and collected evidence \u2014 mostly electronic devices, such as computers \u2014 belonging to Mr. Allwine. Later on, in January, investigators arrested and charged Mr. Allwine with second-degree murder based on the forensic evaluation of the confiscated electronic equipment.\nIn May 2016, a hacker called \u201cbRpsd\u201d breached the database of a controversial hitman service offered on a darknet website. The service, \u201cBesa Mafia,\u201d offered a link between customers and hitmen, who could register on the site anonymously. The price for a murder ranged between $5,000 and $200,000, but clients seeking to avoid fatalities could also hire a contractor to beat up a victim for $500 or set somebody\u2019s car on fire for $1,000.\nThe hacker uploaded the data dump to a public internet website. The leaked files contained user accounts, email addresses, personal messages between the Besa Mafia admin and its customers, \u201chit\u201d orders and a folder named \u201cvictims,\u201d providing additional information on the targets. \nThe breach highlighted the fake nature of the website, which operated only to collect money from the customers. Chris Monteiro, an independent researcher who also hacked into the site, stated the owner or owners of Besa Mafia had made at least 50 bitcoins ($127,500 based on the current value of the cryptocurrency) from the scam operation.\nAccording to a message posted by a Besa Mafia administrator and uncovered in the dump, \u201c[T]his website is to scam criminals of their money. We report them for 2 reasons: to stop murder, this is moral and right; to avoid being charged with conspiracy to murder or association to murder, if we get caught.\u201d\nThe leak of the Besa Mafia database helped the police investigating the murder of Mrs. Allwine. As the officers analyzed her husband\u2019s devices, they discovered the suspect had accessed the dark web as early as 2014. Furthermore, investigators identified the pseudonym Mr. Allwine used on the darknet, \u201cdogdaygod,\u201d which was also linked to his email, \u201cdogdaygod@hmamail.com,\u201d in some cases. Detectives found bitcoin addresses in the conversations between Besa Mafia and Mr. Allwine, which linked the husband directly to the \u201cdogdaygod\u201d pseudonym, providing authorities with necessary evidence for the case.\nEventually, law enforcement agents analyzed the data dump bRpsd leaked and discovered Mr. Allwine\u2019s email in the list. In addition, investigators found messages between the suspect and the Besa Mafia admin. According to a criminal complaint, Mr. Allwine paid between $10,000 to $15,000 to the supposed hitman service to kill his wife. The complaint detailed how Mr. Allwine had decided to have the hitman shoot Mrs. Allwine at close range and burn down the house afterward. \nHowever, once the funds were transferred, the Besa Mafia communicator told Mr. Allwine that \u201clocal police [have] stopped the hitman [from] driving a stolen vehicle and taken [him] to jail prior to the hit,\u201d thus rendering him unable to complete his \u201cservice.\u201d The complaint cited Sergeant McAlister who reported that during that time, \u201cno one was apprehended in Minnesota and western Wisconsin in a stolen vehicle and possession of a gun.\u201d\nIt is likely that the ethical hacker\u2019s data breach had an impact on Mr. Allwine\u2019s case; on March 24, 2017, the Washington County District Court charged him with first-degree murder. In addition, officers have gathered more evidence in the case \u2014 a drug called scopolamine was discovered at 45 times higher than the recommended level in Mrs. Allwine\u2019s body. Investigators subsequently discovered that her husband had also ordered the substance on the dark web.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 30}

In a turn of events, when BTC-USD made its test of the Head and Shoulders neckline, it actually responded in a market reversal.\n\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 6-hr Candles, GDAX, Head and Shoulders Rejection\nYesterday, the crypto market took a turn upward as the market leader made a Double Bottom Reversal pattern that sent a market-wide bear run into an immediate bull run. As the BTC-USD market made an attempt to test the boundaries of the lower prices of the bear run, volume began to pick up and sent us into a market reversal. How does one spot this pattern and where are we headed in the next few days? \n\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 30-min. Candles, GDAX\nCharacteristics of a Double Bottom Reversal pattern include the following:\nA descending trendline within an established bear trend (shown in white)An initial bottom that temporarily reverses before retesting the established low (basically forming a \u201cW\u201d pattern)After a test of the previously established low, the test is rejectedIt is important to note that in order to confirm the reversal pattern, typically you want to see consistent increased volume at the lower values (shown in dark pink)After the low is rejected a second time, it continues upward and breaks the descending trendline established in step 1 (shown in yellow)After breaking the descending trendline, the price then forms a \u201cneckline\u201d with the rest of the pattern (shown in light pink)From there, to confirm the trend reversal, we would want to see a break of the neckline followed by a retest of the neckline (shown in light blue)\nAll the above characteristics are very strong indicators of a complete bear market reversal into a bull market. As mentioned in the previous BTC-USD analysis, the bear run would continue the trend downward until significant volume picked up. In our case, the volume picked up very strongly and made a complete market reversal. Much like BTC-USD, this pattern is seen throughout several major players in the crypto market: ETH-USD, LTC-USD, ETH-BTC, etc.\nIt is unclear where the top of the bull run will lead us, but what is clear is that volume has dramatically picked up, indicating market interest in the higher prices. Until the volume begins to die down, the price will continue to push higher.\nSummary:\nHead and Shoulders pattern was strongly rejected in the form of a Double Bottom ReversalBearish trend has ended in a strong bull trend\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

He regularly writes about various topics, including the dark web, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nAnthony Murgio, 33, of Tampa, Florida, has been sentenced to five and a half years in prison for running a Bitcoin exchange connected to hackers. The exchange was used to launder more than $10 million worth of funds, authorities reported.\nBoth Murgio and Yuri Lebedev, 39, of St. John\u2019s, Florida, operated Coin.mx through a fraudulent company called \u201cCollectables Club.\u201d According to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, the illegal Bitcoin exchange used the firm\u2019s misleading name to open financial accounts at banks pretending to be a \u201cmembers-only association of individuals who discussed, bought, and sold collectible items and memorabilia.\u201d Murgio and Lebedev, along with other co-conspirators, violated bank and credit card company rules and regulations by \u201cdeliberately misidentifying and miscoding Coin.mx customers\u2019 credit and debit card transactions.\u201d\n\u201cLies conceived and deployed by Murgio permeated every aspect of Coin.mx\u2019s operation, including its use of front companies, like Collectables Club and Currency Enthusiasts, to try to conceal the illicit nature of the operation,\u201d the Department of Justice stated in its sentencing submission.\nOn January 9, Murgio pled guilty to three counts regarding operating Coin.mx, which processed over $10 million worth of illegal Bitcoin transactions. Murgio ran the Bitcoin exchange between October 2013 and July 2015 for Gery Shalon, 33, an Israeli citizen who was responsible for hacking at least nine companies, including JPMorgan Chase, E-Trade Financial Corporation and Dow Jones. Coin.mx sold bitcoins that came from illegal online transactions, such as victim payments to ransomware attackers who sought to launder the cryptocurrencies clean.\n\u201cI screwed up badly and made serious mistakes and misjudgments,\u201d Murgio said, showing remorse, to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan at his sentencing.\nShalon, along with Ziv Orenstein, 42, compromised data on approximately 76 million household customers and 7 million businesses by hacking the nine companies. U.S. officials described their operation as a \u201cdiversified criminal conglomerate\u201d responsible for the largest theft of valuable information from a U.S. bank. The compromised data included the names of customers, along with email addresses and phone numbers. Authorities collected evidence stating that Murgio exchanged cash for the bitcoins of Shalon\u2019s criminal gang. Israeli police arrested Shalon and Orenstein in July 2015, and they were extradited to the United States in June 2016. Both are facing serious charges, including aggravated identity theft, wire fraud and money laundering.\n\u201cMr. Murgio led an effort based on ambition and greed,\u201d and constructed on a \u201cpyramid of lies,\u201d Judge Nathan said during the sentencing hearing at the Manhattan federal court.\nOn March 17, a Manhattan jury found Lebedev and his co-conspirator Trevon Gross, 52, of New Jersey, guilty of charges connected to a bribery scheme in an attempt to hide the illegal activities of Coin.mx from financial institutes and regulators. Both of the defendants are facing a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. Judge Nathan scheduled the sentencing hearing of Lebedev and Gross for July 20, 2017.\nMurgio\u2019s father, Michael Murgio, 66, was also involved in the Coin.mx case. In October, the father plead guilty to \u201cmaking a false statement to the National Credit Union Administration on behalf of his son.\u201d By making a plea deal, Michael Murgio managed to avoid additional charges in the case, including \u201cconspiracy to make corrupt payments with intent to influence an officer of a financial institution and making corrupt payments.\u201d Judge Nathan sentenced the elder Murgio to one year of probation along with a $12,000 fine. \nThe FBI arrested both Lebedev and Murgio on July 23, 2015, for \u201crunning an unlicensed bitcoin exchange with the goal of helping individuals launder money.\u201d\nDespite the prosecution\u2019s request for 10 to 12 years and seven months behind bars, the Manhattan federal court sentenced Murgio to five and a half years in prison. According to Reuters, Judge Nathan considered Murgio\u2019s \u201cgenerosity to friends and support to his family\u201d and imposed a prison sentence half as long as the prosecutor recommended.\nJudge Nathan has scheduled a hearing on September 1 to decide on the amount of fines, forfeiture and restitution Murgio has to pay to the state.

The cybersecurity company has built a database updated with \u201c10 to 15 million pages per day, from more than 24,000 domains on the Tor network alone, as well as other darknet networks.\u201d With the darknet content indexed and searchable in 47 different languages, OWL claims their dark web database is the \u201cmost comprehensive one of its kind in the world.\u201d\nIn the study, the OWL picked each and every company from the 2017 Fortune 500 list and assessed them with an overall darknet footprint. OWL uses a specific algorithm for the purpose, rating postings on the dark web based on their potential for criminal use.\n\u201cTo compile our Darknet Index, we ran each member of the 2017 Fortune 500 through the OWL Vision database. We focused on specific darknets for matches on each company\u2019s website and email domains and then further adjusted the results based on computations of \u2018hackishness,\u2019\u201d the report reads.\nWhen valuable information is either stolen or hacked, the data is often offered for sale on the dark web, OWL stated. On dark web marketplaces and forums, criminals exchange illegal products and data \u2014 mostly sourced from hacks and breaches \u2014 for cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin. Therefore, the cybersecurity company measured the exposure of the Fortune 500 firms by analyzing their presence on the darknet.\nAccording to the researchers, in some instances, \u201cprivate data for sale may have come from a breach at a Fortune 500 company, but it may not be identified as such.\u201d OWL explained, for example, that multiple instances of credit card information up for sale on the dark web can come from various sources, including banks or retailers; however, information on the source of the compromised data is not always available or provided.\nOWL ranked the Fortune 500 companies by their Darknet Index score \u2014 calculated by the cybersecurity firm\u2019s algorithm \u2014 and also included the firms\u2019 rankings on the Fortune 500 lists. Ranked by DARKINT (darknet intelligence), technology companies lead the list, with Amazon holding the top spot, but with telecommunications firms right alongside it.\nThe cybersecurity firm pointed out some key takeaways from their analysis. The researchers emphasized that all Fortune 500 companies have a presence on the dark web since \u201cevery single company in the Fortune 500 had a positive Darknet Index score.\u201d OWL explained Amazon\u2019s top ranking with the fact that the firm has a \u201cmassive internet presence and possesses a significant amount of customer data.\u201d \nThe researchers were surprised by the comparatively positive rankings of financial firms, which are frequent targets of cybercriminals. OWL indicated that the financial industry\u2019s significant investment in cybersecurity measures in recent years was the reason for the success. Other sectors in which the firms invested \u201cheavily\u201d in cybersecurity also had lower Darknet Index ratings, the researchers added.\nOWL expects that by publishing such statistics in their report, they can help companies improve their cybersecurity. The cybersecurity firm enables companies with compromised data to monitor the stolen or hacked information on the dark web.\n\u201cToday, in an age where data loss is virtually inevitable, it is critical to look at the darknet as a key part of a complete cybersecurity program, enabling organizations to swiftly detect security gaps and mitigate damage prior to the misuse of data.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 7, "day": 3}

But to no avail. The steel gate to the inner-city courtyard won\u2019t open, and the buttons I\u2019m pressing seem like some kind of doorbell system rather than a lock anyway.\nAs I\u2019m about to give it a second try \u2014 against my better judgement \u2014 two more guys show up. They want to enter too and apparently actually know how to do it.

The guys nod.\nI try some small talk as we move our way into the courtyard.\n\u201cSo, what brings you guys here. Are you investing in ICOs?\u201d\nOne of them answers. His Russian accent is thick, but his English is good. He says he actually works at a company that helps businesses set up ICOs. His job is to get the message out about a new ICO, as far and wide as possible via forums, chat groups, news sites, whatever it takes.

I tell him I know that the founder is supposed to be controversial; but I don\u2019t know the details. \n\u201cI think it could be the next big thing,\u201d he tells me. I nod, noncommittally. I don\u2019t usually put money in these things.\nOn the top floor is another hallway. I notice that the green rubber floor is covered with arrow-shaped stickers. \u201cCrypto friends meetup,\u201d they read. Seems like we made it to the right place indeed. The stickers bring us to the next door. One of the guys knocks, the door opens.\nA bit to my surprise, we now step into a luxurious restaurant. The light-filled rooms with big windows are decorated with antique furniture, and large framed paintings hang on the walls. The restaurant itself is relatively empty, but people have gathered in a bar area in the corner.\n\nThe Deal With ICOs\nIn case you are that one person who hasn\u2019t heard of the phenomenon yet: ICOs \u2014 short for Initial Coin Offerings \u2014 have been the crypto-rage for most of 2017. They are essentially tradable digital tokens, sold as some type of company stock, but issued on a blockchain. And without most of the legal guarantees that actual company stock provides \u2014 assuming these coins can even be considered company stock at all. Maybe they\u2019re more like gift vouchers\u2026 or something. Often, no one really knows.\nEither way, companies have been issuing these ICOs to raise funds for their venture. Lots of funds. ICOs have become somewhat notorious for selling tens of millions of dollars worth of tokens within minutes, earning startups \u2014 often with little more than a whitepaper to show for themselves \u2014 valuations more appropriate for C-series funding rounds.\nThe phenomenon has been catching on in Russia as much as anywhere else. Some of the most successful ICO projects are being developed by Russians \u2014 although they are often officially based abroad to avoid legal trouble. MobileGo is one of them, the mobile gaming platform that raised over $50 million. Another is Waves, itself a platform for ICO tokens, which raised over $16 million. It\u2019s Waves, founded by Moscow-based Sasha Ivanov, that is sponsoring today\u2019s event.\nCrypto Friends\nMild electronic music fills the bar area, and small groups of people \u2014 perhaps two dozen in total \u2014 stand scattered throughout, chatting. Most have a drink in their hands: beer, wine and, in particular, cocktails.\nI take a seat at one of the two tables that seems reserved for the event. One other fellow is sitting at the table. He\u2019s wearing a hoodie and shorts, even though the Saint Petersburg summer is not all that warm. He has his laptop open, his eyes focused on the screen. He looks up after a couple of minutes, so I once again try to make some small talk. He tells me he works in fintech. \u201cReal fintech,\u201d he emphasizes. He develops trading apps for investing.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here is a mania,\u201d he says when I ask him about ICOs. \u201cThere is no underlying value in any of these projects. They better resemble multi-level marketing schemes than proper investments.\u201d\nHe\u2019s clearly not a fan. So I ask him why he showed up at all.\n\u201cMaybe in five months or so, it could develop into something useful,\u201d he says. \u201cThe concept has potential, but it needs to grow into something more serious. It could potentially be an interesting mix between crowdfunding and Initial Public Offerings. Eventually.\u201d\nAnother guy joins the table but doesn\u2019t sit down. He seems to be in his thirties, casually dressed as most people are: a landscape architect, he tells me when I ask him. \u201cI invest but only a little. To make some money on the side,\u201d he says. \u201cMostly in mobile platforms or apps.\u201d His English is a bit shaky. As a friend of his shows up, he bids me goodbye.\nI watch the two of them walk away, and it\u2019s only now that I realize that in the back of the bar area, hidden behind curtains next to the bar itself, is another doorway.\nThe Actual Crypto Friends\nProbably at least a hundred people sit around on sofas throughout this next large, round room, filled with the fruity smoke odor of water pipes. The glass ceiling is covered with cloth to keep some of the light out, and Russian finger food is laid out on coffee tables. The walls around us are covered with paintings, books and even some handcrafted art.\nApparently the bar was just for drinks. This is where the actual meetup is. I take a seat on one of the sofas.\nThere\u2019s no stage. Instead, a guy with a neat, buttoned-up shirt is standing in the middle of the room with a microphone. He\u2019s giving what seems to be an elevator pitch. Within five minutes, the next speaker is up. And the next one some ten minutes after that.\nThe unofficial MC of the night has a spot on a comfortable chair in the middle of the room. Three others are sitting close him: a sort of literal inner circle. They lead the charge in asking questions after each talk. I don\u2019t understand any of it; it\u2019s all in Russian, of course.\nDuring the smoke break \u2014 we\u2019re back in the courtyard \u2014 I walk up to the MC, and ask him if he\u2019s the organizer. He quickly turns me over to Daria, a dark-haired girl in her twenties. I had noticed her pacing around the meetup area during the talks. I learn that she has put together today\u2019s event.\n\u201cThe speakers today cover just about anything there is to know about ICOs,\u201d she explains, when I ask her what the purpose of the meetup is. \u201cThe potential, the risks, the legal aspect of it.\u201d\n\u201cSo why are people here?\u201d I try. \u201cWhat do you think, if you\u2019re being honest? Is it just to make a quick buck?\u201d\n\u201cIt differs,\u201d she says. \u201cThe crowd is diverse. We\u2019ve got programmers, professional investors, hobbyists and more.\u201d\nThough, she clearly agrees that at least some people are here just to make some easy money.\n\u201cSure, some projects are more valid than others. And yes, there\u2019s lots of hype. But it\u2019s a bit like the early days of Kickstarter. Over time the hype will calm down, and this method of fundraising will prove valuable.\u201d\nAnton\nAs the smoke break ends, Daria and the others head back to the big round room. I decide to stick to the bar area this time. At least in there I can chat a bit.\nHaving bought a beer for some $7\u2014 surprisingly expensive by Russian standards \u2014 I\u2019m killing some time on my phone when a blond man joins me at the bar. His name is Anton. He has a British accent, picked up from his studies in the U.K., he says.\n\u201cI see this as Russia\u2019s chance to take on a leadership role in the technology sector. We\u2019ve been trailing the U.S. and Europe too much,\u201d he tells me, after I ask him my by-now standard question: Why are you here?\nAnton is very clearly speaking from a place of passion. He stands close to me, speaking a bit too loudly. He believes in what he says.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not just here to make money, man,\u201d he emphasizes after I tell him I work for Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to see it like that. Blockchains are about much more than that. We\u2019re here to transform society. And that\u2019s important to remember.\u201d\nAnton tells me about the potential of blockchains. The typical buzzwords. Transparent. Immutable. Censorship resistant.\nI feel almost nostalgic, listening to the way Anton explains himself. I remember a similar vibe from back in 2013, when I visited my first Bitcoin meetups. The air was filled with excitement. Andreas Antonopoulos\u2019 talks were going viral for the first time. Bitcoin was gonna change the world in every imaginable way.\n\u201cBlockchain technology has the potential to make an end to corruption,\u201d Anton says. \u201cIt can make votes impossible to forge, for example.\u201d He says he believes the Russian political system has been rigged for decades. \u201cNow, we can have provably fair elections.\u201d\nBut it also makes me slightly uneasy to watch Anton\u2019s enthusiasm, with the ICO bubble that I\u2019ve witnessed being built up.\nThe Bubble\u2026 and the Potential\nAnd it is a bubble. The valuation of many of these projects is far beyond reason, and the evidence that many of the investors have no idea what they\u2019re putting money into is abundant. And that\u2019s without even getting into some of the outright fraudulent claims.\nIn addition to that, the legal status of this whole concept is unclear. There are good arguments to be made that ICOs are really just unlicensed securities, specifically designed to skirt existing regulation. As such, regulators are bound to step in at some point \u2014 else they may as well close shop and find new careers. And when they do step in, it could mean that the ICO party is over very quickly.\nAt the same time, some of the genuine enthusiasm I encounter in Saint Petersburg makes me wonder if I\u2019ve just grown cynical over the past couple of years. The cryptocurrency and blockchain space has been exhausted by scams, failures and toxicity. It\u2019s had a bit of a disheartening effect on many, including myself. \nBut perhaps there\u2019s more to this phenomenon than just scams. Who knows? Maybe the ICO strategy can break down barriers, allowing the common man to access investment markets more easily. Perhaps projects can better raise funds without caring about international borders, restrictions and regulations.\nIndeed, perhaps ICOs could at one point be a fruitful \u201cmixture between Kickstarter and IPOs.\u201d If nothing else, the phenomenal valuations suggest that there may be untapped liquidity markets.\n\u201cIn Russia we have the developers, we have good ideas, and we have the talent,\u201d as one of the meetup attendees tried to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s money, funding that\u2019s hard to come by. ICOs are a chance to realize that part of the puzzle.\u201d\nNote: Some names have been changed to protect privacy and anonymity.\n\nAaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff.

Bitcoin Schmitcoin became popular within the subculture of the Reddit communities and now posts his daily thoughts and market outlook via Twitter and his regular stream on Twitch.tv.\nBitcoin Schmitcoin on Twitch.tv\n\nBitcoin Schmitcoin: YouTube\nFollowing a devastating bear market last week, several major market players saw a reversal pattern called a Double Bottom Reversal. \u00a0For reference, please check out the previous BTC-USD market analysis where an in-depth description of Double Bottom Reversals is outlined.\nFigure 1: \u00a0ETH-USD, 4HR Candles, Gemini, Double Bottom Reversal\nThe buy-back volume seemed very promising on the reversal pattern and it even saw textbook characteristics of a healthy bull rally. \u00a0However, if we take a closer look at the market move, we can see something slightly concerning regarding the health of the bull trend. \u00a0To gain some insight, let\u2019s examine the finer points of the reversal pattern:\nFigure 2: \u00a0ETH-USD, 30Min Candles, Gemini, Failed 100% Retracement\nThe most immediately concerning aspect of this bull run is the failed test of the 100% Fibonacci Retracement. \u00a0Typically, a healthy Double Bottom Reversal that leads to a prolonged bull run will test the 100% retracement value (sometimes several tests are required) and ultimately yield higher values as the volume supports market interest. \u00a0However, in our case, not only did this market move see a rejection of the 100% retracement line, but it also continued a trend of decreasing volume. \u00a0Decreasing volume shows the declining market interest in these high values, and it doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of support for the bullish trend.\nThe second concerning element of this bull run is the retracement it is currently seeing: \u00a0The market is testing the 61% Fibonacci Retracement values which coincide with a significant level of support for this run (shown in orange). \u00a0At the time of this article, this run tested the support level three times and is now moving on to test the 61% value. \u00a0These lower values are paired with increasing spikes in sell volume. \u00a0\nOn the higher timescales, the MACD (an indicator of market momentum) still remains on the bullish side but is beginning to head toward bearish values. \u00a0The 4-hour MACD has flipped to bearish, and the current market doesn\u2019t show any indication in the near future of slowing its downward climb.\nIn order to maintain the support at the 61% value, we will need to see an increase in buy volume to stymie the slowly descending trend we are currently witnessing. \u00a0\u00a0In the coming hours/days, if the market fails the test of the 61% line, we can expect the following support levels:\nFigure 3: \u00a0ETH-USD, 30Min Candles, GDAX, Expected Support Levels Following 61% Failure\nDuring both the previous bear run and the formation of the Double Bottom Reversal pattern, we saw levels of support/resistance at the 50% retracement values (shown in pink) and the 38% retracement values (shown in green). \u00a0A further test of those values will prove crucial if the ETH-USD markets are to remain in this pseudo-bullish trend. \u00a0Failure to see a significant increase in volume will undoubtedly lead to another bear market situation. \u00a0Given the declining volume throughout this entire reversal, at this moment I\u2019m inclined to lean more toward a bearish outlook in the near future. \u00a0Until volume begins to pick up, the market will continue to slowly hemorrhage as market sentiment declines.\nSummary:\n Double Bottom Reversal failed the test of the 100% retracement from the previous bear trend.Until a significant increase in volume is seen, the market will most likely continue this descending trend.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

These peer-to-peer systems utilize blockchain technology to conduct and verify transactions.\nSince the network is decentralized, there is no main authority to judge whether transactions are legitimate or not. The creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, worked around this by having participants\u2019 computers solve part of a cryptographic puzzle. Helping to solve this verifies the blockchain and grants a specific number \u2014 or fractions \u2014 of bitcoins.\nAlthough it sounds complicated, in theory, anyone with some type of computer can get into the cryptocurrency market. Initially, cryptocurrencies were slow to catch on. However, a recent study shows just the opposite.\n3 Million Users \u2014 and Growing\nA recent report released by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance shows that cryptocurrencies have a broader acceptance than originally believed. It estimates that more than 3 million people are actively mining, accumulating and storing cryptocurrencies. This puts its research at odds with previous guesstimates, which pegged the number at around 1 million.\nTo reach this conclusion, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance analyzed data gathered from roughly 75 percent of the cryptocurrency industry \u2014 more than 100 companies in 38 countries.\nThis study is quite a big deal, and highlights the unprecedented growth of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was established in 2009 and enjoyed complete market domination for quite a while. Recently though, it's fallen to 72 percent, thanks to the introduction of other cryptocurrencies.\nEven business has jumped on the bandwagon, which is a good thing, as it will be the key to Bitcoin's long-term survival. As more and more companies accept bitcoin as a form of payment, attitudes surrounding the currency itself will change. People will see it as less of an investment \u2014 like stock \u2014 and more like what it really is \u2014 money.\nIncreased acceptance in the business market is also a positive sign for nonprofits, as it gives them more precedence to accept bitcoin donations. Although this was still in its early adoption phase back in 2014,\u00a0many nonprofits are now seeing Bitcoin\u2019s advantages over cash, besides providing an additional revenue stream.\nFor one thing, the processing fees are much lower than those of credit card transactions. Furthermore, some third-party processors even do conversions for nonprofits at no cost. This also greatly simplifies donations from overseas. \nPerhaps most surprising is that there are no tax-reporting obligations, as the IRS classifies bitcoins as property for tax purposes. Thus, in the nonprofit world, bitcoins are noncash gifts, which are not assigned any value.\nThe Future of Cryptocurrencies\nAs the number of cryptocurrency users grows, the system must change to accommodate them. One subject that's due for an overhaul in 2017 in privacy.\nCurrently, with the right information, it's quite simple to tie a Bitcoin address to an owner. This opens up a potential avenue for individuals compromising private information.\nWe may also see the advent of classes focused on cryptocurrencies, such as the ones developed by Ohio University. Colleges may even start to accept bitcoins as tuition payment. \nOverall, the future of cryptocurrencies seems bright. With 3 million active users and counting, businesses across the nation may soon support them as payment methods. Nonprofits will have more flexibility with donations, and students will have more options to pay for college. As for the future of the U.S. dollar, only time will tell.\n\nThis is a guest post by Kayla Matthews.

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nOver the past 30 days, ether has risen a staggering 350% and, at this point in time, it could literally go to a million. There is no top, anyone telling you otherwise is a fool. The reversal will be swift, violent and highly publicized, but until then, I see no reason why the bubble cannot continue for the next few weeks at least.\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that Ethereum\u2019s market cap will surpass Bitcoin for a period of time, at least until SegWit and Lightning Network are active. Much like Bitcoin, Ethereum will have to endure its own scaling growing pains, but may find quicker avenues of compromise thanks to Ethereum\u2019s centralized nature. Unlike Bitcoin, however, Ethereum does not currently have a finite supply and therefore should not be seen as a store of value.\nOver the past 24 hours, South Korea has led the reported trading volume, even surpassing Poloniex, the ETH/BTC volume leader.\n\nWe have new ICOs and tokens being released every week. Everyone from Vinny Lingham to Trace Mayer are releasing ICOs. The current most popular use case for Ethereum is buying these speculative vehicles and turning them around for a quick profit. Correlation is not causation, but the proximity of the two should be damning enough. The top 1000 token wallets sit above $5 billion at the moment.\nMany people are comparing this to the Dot Com bubble, but I see it slightly differently. I\u2019d compare it more to the early blockchain days when thousands of new alt coins were released. Most were useless, vaporware-riddled speculative vehicles which died quickly or slowly, though some still remain with valid use cases today. The early ICO/token days appear to be very similar, except for the speed at which the ICO 2.0 on the Ethereum blockchain is receiving funds. The BAT ICO raised $36 million in 30 seconds. Bancor, a platform and protocol that will enable tokenization faster, raised $150 million just yesterday in the largest ICO ever and is also the largest crowdfund ever.\nOne impetus for the end of the bubble would be regulatory guidelines prohibiting the average user from participating in ICO-like vehicles and reducing the participants to accredited investors only. \nThe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.John Maynard Keynes\nWhen the bubble does burst, I would look towards the 200 EMA for support, currently sitting around $85. Price has not touched the 200 EMA since breaking above it in early February. Should RSI hold around 50 after the larger correction, expect continuation of trend. Should RSI dip below 30, there would be a larger chance that trend may be over. \n\nThe $100 sell off yesterday, with a bounce on the 30 minute 200 EMA and Monthly Pivot has already quickly retraced.\n \nFib extensions and monthly pivot yield an immediate resistance at $450. The 1.618 fib extension sits around $490.\nSummary\nYes, Ethereum is in a bubble. No, it is not sustainable indefinitely. Yes, it will likely continue in the near term due to the unregulated \u00fcber speculation of tokenization.When the regulations hit, likely from the Securities and Exchange Commission which had been looking into the DAO fiasco, the reversal of token value, and subsequently Ethereum, will be swift. Technicals are showing reasonable upside targets of $450 and $490.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 13}

According to Hedge Fund Research, hedge fund portfolios gained only 3.5 percent in value from January to May of 2017, heavily underperforming the S&P 500 Index, which generated a return of 7 percent in the same time period.\nHedge funds are investment funds that can invest in a wide array of assets and adopt different types of investment strategies. Unlike mutual funds or pension funds, hedge funds are not constrained by regulatory requirements to primarily invest in stock and bonds and can, therefore, also invest in real estate, derivatives, and currencies, among other asset classes. This freedom of choice is what gives hedge funds a competitive advantage over traditional funds. For this ability to generate better returns, hedge funds charge a high annual management fee (usually 2 percent) as well as a performance fee. However, as witnessed in the first five months of 2017, these fees are not always warranted.\nThe HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index, which is an equally weighted index that tracks the performance of hedge funds, is up only 0.5 percent in May, while the S&P 500 Index is up twice as much. Given the rise in popularity of low-cost index tracker funds and an eight-year rally in stocks, hedge funds are struggling to justify their high fee structures to investors. \nBitcoin Is Boosting Hedge Fund Returns\nThe start of the year, however, was not gloomy for all hedge fund managers. The funds that did outperform were those focusing on technology and currencies. \nFX funds that had the foresight to gain exposure to digital currencies such as bitcoin managed to outperform their peers as well as the S&P 500 Index. The HFRI Macro: Currency Index, for example, gained 8.2 percent year-to-date. \nThis should not come as a surprise given the impressive rallies of digital currencies such as bitcoin and ether, which both reached numerous new all-time highs in the spring months of 2017 and generated a 190 percent and 4,900 percent return respectively since the start of the year. \nMost Portfolio Managers Still Avoid Cryptocurrency\nDespite the exuberant returns of leading digital currencies such as bitcoin, ether and litecoin in the past six months, the majority of hedge fund portfolio managers are still staying clear of digital currencies as an asset class. \nThe reluctance to invest in digital currencies ranges from a lack of in-depth knowledge about the asset class to concerns of liquidity and fears of cyber theft. \nLouis Gargour, Wall Street veteran and founder of hedge fund LNG Capital, suggests that bitcoin is not ready yet for widespread adoption as an institutional asset class. \nHe told CNBC: \"Bitcoin's extreme volatility doesn't sit well with managers working on a risk-adjusted return basis. Furthermore, there are valid concerns that digital currency assets can be hacked or stolen. Finally, there's a perception that bitcoin remains a niche, retail investment that does not yet demonstrate sufficient quality to be seriously considered for many reputable institutions.\"\nOn the other hand, Bobby Cho, trader at Cumberland Mining, a subsidiary of DRW Trading, told Bitcoin Magazine: \"The digital currency investment landscape is changing rapidly along with the mindset of investors. A few years ago, bitcoin wasn't viewed as a viable asset class through the eyes of hedge funds.\u201d \nHowever, this has started to change according to Cho. \u201cToday, Cumberland Mining works with both traditional and digital-only funds by providing institutional-sized liquidity in different digital currencies, most notably bitcoin and ethereum.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 14}

Entrepreneurs have been working on a package of legislation to ensure that, instead of just incentivizing large companies to relocate to the State, we have policies incentivizing them and smaller companies to start and grow here.\u201d\nThe bill clarified the definition of blockchain technology, espousing it as \u201can electronic record created by the use of a decentralized method by multiple parties to verify and store a digital record of transactions which is secured by the use of a cryptographic hash of previous transaction information.\u201d\nSmart contracts are also defined as an electronic record, verified by the use of a blockchain: \u201cA smart contract, record or signature may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because a blockchain was used to create, store or verify the smart contract, record or signature.\u201d\nMost notably, electronic signatures recorded on the blockchain are now protected: \u201cIf a law requires a signature, submission of a blockchain which electronically contains the signature or verifies the intent of a person to provide the signature satisfies the law,\u201d per the bill\u2019s decree.\nTwo other U.S. states have taken similar steps to recognize blockchains as an appropriate data store, with seven in total codifying legislation pertaining to blockchains. \nA number of other U.S. states have recognized, or are in the process of recognizing, blockchains as an appropriate data store. The most similar bill is from the neighboring state of Arizona, which passed House Bill 2417 into law toward the end of March. Unlike Nevada\u2019s, however, this bill falls short of providing restrictions on taxes and licensing. \nA number of \u00a0Nevada-based business leaders offered strong support and testimony for the bill, including Allison Clift-Jennings, founder of Filament, a Reno-based firm that is fostering the application of IoT and blockchain technology for industrial use. \n\"Having Nevada pass this legislation puts the state at an advantage, in that it clearly and succinctly outlines not so much what the state will do, but what the state will not do, when it comes to blockchain regulation,\u201d Clift-Jennings said to Bitcoin Magazine. \n\u201cWith a technology as powerful and new as this, it\u2019s important for both established companies and startups alike to know how their jurisdiction will treat this new technology. \u00a0We\u2019re very happy with how it turned out, and appreciate Senator Kieckhefer and Clift & Co. for their efforts in getting this passed unanimously in both the Assembly and the Senate.\"\nJaron Lukasiewicz, vice-president of the Las Vegas-based construction consultancy Rhodes Corporation and an advisor to SONM (the decentralized supercomputing network) told Bitcoin Magazine that it\u2019s \u201cfantastic\u201d to see Nevada taking the initiative in providing a welcoming environment for blockchain businesses in the state. \u201cNevada\u2019s actions will help attract entrepreneurs in this growing industry to the state, hopefully promoting a high concentration of blockchain talent here.\u201d \nLukasiewicz believes it has been easy for governments to develop a negative bias toward bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for a variety of reasons. He says that blockchain technology, however, seems to be moving in a different direction. \u201cMost regulators on every level of government appear to understand the importance of blockchain technology and are working to create an environment that attract startups in the space.\u201d \nTo read the full senate bill, click here.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 13}

Gang violence in neighborhoods, terrorist attacks in cities, accidental gun discharge among kids, mass attacks at schools and businesses \u2014 these and other forms of gun activities are leading to calls for reform throughout the world.\nThrough the use of smart technology, the startup Blocksafe seeks to deliver a blockchain-centric solution for gun ownership and their safe use. Its core premise is predicated on a key issue tied to firearms, namely the danger they pose when they migrate into the hands of non-owners.\nWith the support of the Blocksafe Foundation, an organization evangelizing smart-gun technology and gun-ownership freedoms, an innovative device and decentralized network is advancing in its development. Its mission is to create a safer world through weapons tracking and accountability, preventing guns from falling into the wrong hands and being utilized by unauthorized gun users.\nCitizens, law enforcement agencies and armed security firms will have 24/7 real-time access to the secure and anonymous Blocksafe network, thereby allowing them the ability to self-monitor their supported firearms devices. Owners can receive notifications if shots are fired by an unauthorized user of their guns. Moreover, they have the ability to locate and disable a stolen weapon, all through the Blocksafe app or web portal. \nIt should be noted, however, that Blocksafe cannot identify the actual shooter who is utilizing the firearm. Rather it\u2019s more of a tracking mechanism for both individual owners as well as gun store owners, giving them peace of mind as to where their firearms are at all times. \nBy way of example, an adult at work might remember that his gun is possibly accessible to his kids at home. Blocksafe can help him track where the gun actually is and even remotely disable it. Again, the goal is to offer some semblance of control to the owner in the event that the firearm ends up in the hands of an unauthorized user, which often results in a gun tragedy. \nAnother illustrative use case: A gun owner whose house is robbed while she is away can remotely disable the stolen firearm, rendering it unable to be resold or used later in a crime.\nPulling the Trigger on Innovation\nKevin Barnes, founder and chairman of Blocksafe, is an honorably discharged U.S. Army veteran, blockchain developer and passionate advocate of gun ownership. He is also a tech coder of 20 years. \nRaised among liberty-minded gun lovers, he was taught to embrace the U.S. constitutional right to bear arms first and foremost. As he listened to and read about politicians pushing smart-gun efforts in the media, he feared a loss of life or liberty due to risks inherited by a centralized smart-gun infrastructure. These concerns led him to launch Blocksafe.\nIn this interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Barnes discusses the evolution of Blocksafe and his greatest hopes around the future of gun safety worldwide. \u00a0\nCan you describe the moment when the Blocksafe idea first struck you?\nBeing an avid gun lover, I was at a range teaching my wife to shoot various firearms and she began thinking about what to do if she was overpowered by a thug while she was armed. At that moment the concept of \u201cBlocksafe\u201d was born.\u00a0\nIn layman's terms, what is Blocksafe?\nI tend to think of Blocksafe as a light version of particle.io for enhanced firearm technology. It is a full-stack IoT device network that gives innovators what they need to enable users to securely manage their devices and data. Blocksafe can also facilitate an innovator\u2019s use case in IoT development, expediting their roadmap to the market with security and anonymity for the user and sensor data being the major area of focus. \nBlocksafe enables innovators to develop a myriad of solutions to solve the problems associated with firearms \u2014 such as malware and ransomware risks \u2014 that were not possible before without compromise. \nHow does this benefit the gun industry? \nDecentralized applications (DApps) can be developed in a way that greatly benefits companies in the gun industry. For example, a third-party device is created by a manufacturer. They could install a custom-built DApp onto it, so the manufacturer can easily track its inventory and distribution. \nWhat about the economics of your solution? \nEconomically, revenue can be generated from the upsale of enhanced add-on devices to firearms. With the cost of the IoT infrastructure greatly reduced, innovators can focus on improving their product to meet market demands, especially those from a newer generation who are always connected. Innovators can also better meet government and commercial needs for these enhancing devices.\nWhat sorts of other use cases are being bantered about? \nHere are a few that might align with the Blocksafe model.\nLitigation: enhancing the authenticity of a camera video allowed in court proceedings.\nProduct Theft: a gunstore can recoup their firearms if stolen.\nInsurance: armoured trucks and security companies in general can better monitor and manage the firearm usage of their employees.\nTraining: Instructors can use analytics to study shooting skills to better train students, thereby reducing the likelihood of accidents.\nWhat are Blocksafe trigger tokens and how will they work? \nTriggers are the appropriately named \u201ctokens\u201d that power every event from smart devices to the Blocksafe network. The token is an Counterparty asset (which may become ERC223 later) that will be introduced during demonstrations at CoinAgenda in Las Vegas later this year.\nWhat else are you currently introducing?\nSoon we will be demonstrating with the TrackingPoint M400 to our \u00a0smart-gun network. There are many sensors, a smart trigger and a smart scope on the firearm that make it a great candidate to use in demonstration.\nWe will also be introducing another DApp use case made for mobile phones and tablets called \u201cGunshot Spot.\u201d It\u2019s a free gunfire-mapping app and token wallet that sends notifications of gunfire and its proximity. Users will have the option to anonymously share the data to the app community, which will be used to populate gunfire mapping within the app using Blocksafe. Think of it as SpotCrime for gunfire.\nWhat steps have you taken to garner support from the gun industry?\nWe have provided a pilot signup page for our network\u2019s web portal. We are also in talks with many firearm and accessory manufacturers, some of which we met at the recent NRA show in Atlanta. A quarter of them expressed positive interest in Blocksafe as they recognize that nothing is stopping the progression of defense tech and the launch of Blocksafe. One exhibitor summed it up in one sentence: \u201cBlocksafe\u2019s use case is that it enables use cases development for enhanced firearm solutions that were never possible before.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve also received a lot of support from organizations that support the firearm industry such as Smart Tech Foundation, which we plan to join in their effort to support startup innovators entering the enhanced firearm space.\nWhat is your response to libertarians and others concerned about gun privacy and anonymity? \nWhat I say to them is that enhanced firearm tech is going to continue to develop no matter what. When I was following the smart-gun mandates from President Obama and his administration, all I could picture was my wife, kids and future grandkids with a weapon that some third party could share control of. \nAs a programmer of 20 years and a Bitcoin enthusiast, I realized the only solution was to bring to market a network that would prevent that nightmare. At the same time, we can use the blockchain to save lives by enhancing the very tool that has been protecting our freedom in such a way that the device owner keeps full control of the device features and data.\nAs is the belief of many libertarians, I have the liberty to choose how to defend myself and my family. It is our human right. Whether it is using a 25-year-old revolver or a TrackingPoint AR, we all have the liberty to choose our firearm of choice. \nBut how do you think these arguments will sit with the government? \nWe spend millions to politically protect our legal rights to defend ourselves. We must also focus on making sure the technology is not used against us \u2014 as, without an alternative, the chances of technical tyranny is a threat too great to chance \u2014 regardless of the laws. \nPlus, I think it is cool not being able to be shot with my own weapon.\nWhat is your long-term, grand vision for Blocksafe? \nSimply to continue to help grow the enhanced-firearm space including expanding the consortium globally. We will try to incubate startups and launch Smart Gun News to showcase the innovators and aggregate news in the space. We also endeavor to work with nations to adopt blockchain tech and their smart city efforts in general. Ultimately, as I see it, it\u2019s about promoting a safer and more peaceful world full of liberty.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 13}
{"title": "Op Ed: Why Connecting All the Blockchains Is the Final Step for Mass Adoption", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-edwhy-connecting-all-blockchains-final-step-mass-adoption/", "birthday": "Jun 14, 2017 11:49 AM EST", "date": "2017-06-14 16:49:00", "content": "Since the start of Bitcoin in January 2009, we have seen the introduction of a multitude of blockchains across all kinds of areas and financial markets. Today, we can count hundreds of public blockchains that amount to a total market cap of almost $100 billion, excluding many more private blockchain installations.\nLast year, we saw the emergence of precious metal-backed tokens and derivatives, entirely new asset classes representing entire ecosystems and even ETF tokens to invest into other blockchain assets. One such example is Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) or token sales that are gaining in popularity. \nThe World Economic Forum is even going as far to predict that 10 percent of the global GDP will be stored on the blockchain in less than 10 years. In terms of today\u2019s global GDP that would be $7.8 trillion. \nHere a challenge arises: If we, as a community, do not find a way to connect blockchains, these $7.8 trillion will be dispersed in such a way that its true value is a lot lower. \nSo what is the solution? It\u2019s one that we already saw being executed in a similar way around 30 years ago.\nFrom Intranets to Internet\nBefore the invention of the TCP/IP protocol, the internet was also dispersed in many local networks, so-called intranets. These provided local efficiency over more traditional point-to-point communications (such as letters, faxes or telephone calls). The real breakthrough only came in 1973 when different intranet networks realized that they could use a unifying inter-network protocol to communicate among each other, thereby extending their reach by compatibility even more.\nBy dropping the requirements for an intranet to join the so-called internet to the bare minimum, it became possible to add almost any intranet, no matter how basic or sophisticated its characteristics were.\nThe initial adoption by users was relatively slow, as the services offered at the beginning were limited. There was one major factor, however, that eventually sped it up significantly. The same providers that were already offering mail, fax and phone services could now add internet services to their portfolios, giving them extra revenue streams. User adoption came easily, as a trust basis between the customers and these service providers was already established for years or even decades. Early adopters started, the later adopters followed.\nToday, the internet spans across the entire world, and information that used to be accessible only locally is now accessible from anywhere, even from the moon. Information is stored by servers all over the world while routers create the backbone. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) give the average end-user easy and quick access to this vast database of information by opening a communication channel to their customers and to other ISPs, servers and routers.\nOnce the average user accesses the internet through his or her communication channel with the ISP in order to gain information from the internet, the user does not have to worry about how the information is retrieved exactly. All he or she has to do is type in the destination from where the information will be retrieved from (URL). The ISP which the user has the communication channel to does not know the exact path to the destination either. However, through the TCP/IP protocol, the request is routed through from one communication channel to another using routers, servers or ISPs, who then either know the location or continue the process. The important point is, neither one of them has to know the entire way. All they have to do is to trust the TCP/IP protocol, which has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host, solely based on the IP addresses in the packet headers. Its routing function enables inter-networking and essentially establishes the internet.\nConnecting the Blockchains\nHow does this translate into connecting blockchains? What if there was a way to connect literally any blockchain, without creating a new larger blockchain, like some companies have suggested? Creating a new blockchain would be like a large intranet, that all the other intranets would have to trust. It would be way more difficult to convince everyone. It is easier to leave everyone on their blockchain/intranet and just connect them.\nWith that in mind, I, therefore, suggested a Cryptographically-secure Off-chain Multi-asset Instant Transaction network (COMIT) at the end of 2016 and wrote a whitepaper about it.\nWhat would such a network look like? Just like the internet, we need a stable and trustworthy backbone. In our opinion, any large blockchain provides exactly that. It can be any blockchain because, just like on the Internet, different modalities will be interconnected. For example, the initial internet never foresaw mobile app messaging services, but these have been implemented without any problems. The same will be true for COMIT, where any new blockchain can be connected to an existing one through the use of the COMIT Routing Protocol (CRP).\nA user today who is using cryptocurrencies currently has to wait minutes if not hours before a transaction is accepted by the counterparty. With the adoption of payment channels such as the Lightning Network, Raiden or many others, such users can transfer assets instantly from person A to person B. If person B then opens another payment channel to person C, person A can also transfer assets to person C via B instantaneously, as long as person B provides enough liquidity. \nIn theory, there can be an infinite chain of participants in between person A and C, as long as they all provide enough liquidity. Again, such transactions are immediate without person A needing to know which route the assets took to end up at person C. Users can trust this system as the routing protocol ensures its correctness, plus the cryptographically secured payment channels, which will be described in the next chapter, ensures flawless functionality.\nWhat we end up with are off-blockchain, cryptographically-secured, instant payments that can even be transferred from one asset to another via hashed time-lock contracts (those will also be described in a future post). In order for this network to have enough liquidity (in the example above person B needs to provide enough liquidity to enable a transaction between person A and person C), we introduce the concept of Liquidity Providers (LP). LPs can be seen or understood as hubs or nodes in the COMIT network that create payment channels to users, other LPs and businesses. They are a core part in COMIT, just like servers, routers and ISPs are to the internet.\nAdoption of this system will be seamless, fast and will bring great benefits to all of its participants, just like the internet did. Some of the benefits of COMIT include, but are not limited to,\nopen source infrastructure;true instant, frictionless and cheap payments for users all over the world;true global access without limitations to any asset or business process connected to a blockchain;cryptographically secure, trustless global transactions network;new business opportunities for companies;new and recurring revenue streams for banks and other liquidity providers; andrapid adoption based on existing networks build with new, cheap and secure infrastructure.\nAccording to our research, over 95 percent of all the blockchains (especially the large important ones) can be connected. In a future post, I will discuss in great detail what the three requirements are for such a system to work and how it looks from a technical perspective.\n\nThe author Dr. Julian Hosp is the co-founder and CVO of TenX.\nTenX (www.tenx.tech) is a Singapore-based financial service that makes any blockchain asset spendable instantly by offering a debit card payment system to its users on the frontend and by connecting any blockchain at the backend.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 14}

The intensity of competition and number of \u201cme-too\u201d or \u201ccopycat\u201d projects are only going to increase dramatically.\nSo, it\u2019s a good thing that some of the startups in the decentralization industry are getting ready. \nBlockchain Startups Have Not Invested in Marketing \u2026 but They Will\nAccording to the \u201cMarketing Maturity of Decentralized Startups, Q2 2017 Report\u201d just released by the Decentralized Marketing Network (DMN) \u2014 a co-op of blockchain startups such as Rootstock, Tierion and OB1, pooling their marketing knowledge \u2014 3 out of every 4 blockchain and decentralized startups plan to increase their marketing headcount in the next 12 months. Further, 70 percent of them plan to increase their spend on marketing.\nIt\u2019s a good thing too, because the report uncovered something that most industry observers have known for a long time. When blockchain-based startups \u201cmarket,\u201d their messaging is often inconsistent, ad hoc and typically more aligned to features than benefits. \u00a0\nIt\u2019s no surprise really. \nMost disruptive technological periods begin this way. There\u2019s a flurry of great engineering-led innovations, but marketing maturity is low. The report backs this up, finding that an average of only 5 percent of budgets were spent on marketing, and only 35 percent of startups have \u00a0anyone who even has responsibility for marketing.\nBeware: Marketing Is Misunderstood\nThe number of reasons why marketing as a discipline is misunderstood are many. Everyone has familiarity with tactics such as advertising, promotional items, flyers, business cards and websites. So, naturally, everyone thinks they understand marketing.\nSadly, that\u2019s not the case. In her fantastic review of the book Drucker on Marketing by William A. Cohen, Jenny Cheung writes that \u201cselling has to do with persuading a prospect to buy something you have. Marketing has to do with already having what prospects want.\u201d\nWhat Smart Marketers Do and You Can As Well\nMarketing isn\u2019t an afterthought. It\u2019s the critical thinking that goes into creating a product or service that actually meets someone\u2019s active or latent needs.\nGetting there doesn\u2019t have to take eight months. It can be done in a few weeks, but it involves:\ncreating a brand platform;refining a strong, differentiated value proposition;understanding your audience and the various personas; building a messaging platform (here\u2019s a way to get started quickly); andcreating a tight marketing plan that aligns objectives, goals, strategies and tactics.\nIt also involves operational and strategic discipline, which are covered more broadly in \u201c14 Rules for Successful High-Growth Marketing.\u201d\nMost important of all is that it is never too early to get started. Des Traynor, the founder of Intercom (a $50m revenue company), has a really powerful talk in which he basically says, \u201cWe made a lot of marketing mistakes early on and I wish we had done it differently.\u201d\nLearn the Lesson: Tech Alone Isn\u2019t Enough ...\nThe classic example of a superior technology losing the battle is the Betamax\u2013VHS battle in the \u201980s. Betamax started off with a near 100 percent market share, but VHS countered by offering recording times of two, then four, then six hours versus Betamax\u2019s higher-quality picture but with only one hour\u2019s worth of recording time. Why time instead of quality?\nThe answer turns out to be something that sits at the core of marketing. The legendary Peter Drucker said that the \u201caim of marketing is to know the customer so well that the product sells itself.\u201d What the VHS proponents figured out was that customers wanted to record movies. They were longer than one hour, which made VHS a superior choice, even if it wasn\u2019t superior quality.\nBy focusing on extending the length of time available on a tape based on that insight, they were able to meet customer needs and emerge victorious.\nAs decentralized startups enter the next phase, making the investment in marketing earlier rather than later is the wise way to go.\nAccording to the Decentralized Marketing Network, many startups have realized that. The DMN is planning to offer webinars, newsletters and forums all with the goal of giving technical founders a strong understanding of marketing fundamentals in positioning, value proposition and messaging. The better understood that marketing is as a discipline, the better the chances are for the the success of a technology.\n\nThis is a guest post by Jeremy Epstein.

He is enamored with blockchain technology and passionate about bringing Bitcoin and decentralized systems to the technological vanguard.\nCrypto Fund AG has announced the creation of a \u201cCryptocurrency Fund\u201d which will invest in a variety of digital currencies such as bitcoin, ether and ripple, among others. The fund plans to launch in Q4 2017.\nThis would be Europe\u2019s first ever diversified cryptocurrency fund. The fund is based on a Cryptocurrency Index which \u201cinvests in the largest virtual currencies by market capitalization and liquidity.\u201d \nThis development would bring a new level of investment transparency to the digital asset class market. \n\u201cThe fund will be highly diversified,\u201d said Jan Brzezek, CEO of Crypto Fund AG. He explained that this diversification will lead to lower levels of volatility while still reaping the \u201chigh growth\u201d benefits of new cryptocurrencies. \nThe fund\u2019s goal is to raise roughly $113 million (\u20ac100 million) of assets under management during the first year with the ambitious target of $3.4 billion (\u20ac3 billion) within three years. The fund already has investors who have dedicated $11.3 million (\u20ac10 million) with an additional $11.3 million (\u20ac10 million) in transition to the pool. \nThe fund, headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, has already initiated preliminary discussions with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the body responsible for financial regulation. Switzerland has historically had a positive track record with cryptocurrencies and their regulation. It recognizes virtual currencies as a class of assets and is currently home to a variety of bitcoin financial companies. \nNot the First Attempt \nThis is not the first time an entity has attempted to register a bitcoin financial vehicle. \nIn July 2013, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss filed to establish the first cryptocurrency Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A bitcoin ETF would allow investors to invest in bitcoin without actually owning the digital asset. This would have radically increased the accessibility of bitcoin and brought a flood of new investors to the decentralized currency. \nHowever, just earlier this year, the SEC ruled against the establishment of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust due to the lack of regulation that occurs on bitcoin markets. However, the SEC did note that as bitcoin continues to emerge from its nascent form, more regulated markets could appear, thus \u201cthe Commission could consider whether a bitcoin ETF would, based on the facts and circumstances then presented, be consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act.\u201d\nThough this initial attempt in the U.S. was unsuccessful, Crypto Fund AG appears to have more promise in moving forward. Zug, Swtizerland, often called \u201cCrypto Valley,\u201d has proven to be a strong foundation for the stable regulation of digital currencies. Additionally, the Cryptocurrency Fund has key advantageous differences from the Winklevoss ETF. \n\u201cUnlike the Winklevoss ETF, which was rejected by the SEC, we use the regulated and proven Swiss fund structure according to the Swiss Collective Investment Schemes Act (CISA), where the asset manager, the fund management company and the custodian bank are legally separate from each other,\u201d said Brzezek. Additionally, unlike the Bitcoin Investment Trust, it will not be listed on an exchange and will \u201cexclusively target qualified investors.\u201d \nThe company is led by CEO & co-founder Jan Brzezek, Dr. Tobias Reichmuth, and Marc Bernegger. Brzezek previously served at UBS working in the Asset Management division.. He is joined by Reichmuth and Bernegger two fintech specialists who have founded SUSI Partners AG and usgang.ch, respectively.

A segment of the financial industry that could benefit greatly from the implementation of the distributed ledger technology is the wealth and asset management sector.\nThe global accountancy firm Ernst & Young published a report on the benefits of blockchain technology for the wealth and asset management industry titled \u2018Blockchain Innovation in Wealth and Asset Management.\u2019 The report states that the implementation of blockchain technology would likely result in reduced operational expenses, elimination of redundant yet time consuming functions and more opportunities to better the client experience. More specifically, using blockchain technology in important areas such as the client onboarding process, the creation of model portfolios, the settling and clearing of trades and compliance processes related to AML regulations can all be improved by implementing distributed ledger technology-based solutions in the wealth management industry. \nBlockchain Use Cases in Wealth Management\nIn this report, Ernst & Young highlights two use cases as examples of the benefits of the blockchain.\nFirstly, blockchain technology can be applied to digitize and streamline the customer onboarding and profiling process. Strict regulatory requirements require wealth managers to collect information such as proof of identification, marital status, residency, sources of wealth and political ties from new potential clients. This can be a cumbersome, long-winded and, therefore, costly process. \nIf, instead, high net-worth individuals\u2019 data were to be stored on a distributed ledger to which permissioned parties could gain access with the individual\u2019s approval, then this would greatly reduce the time and cost of onboarding a new customer. Furthermore, due to the immutability and auditability of the blockchain, an audit trail could easily be kept for each client. \nSecondly, the blockchain could facilitate the creation of portfolios and the communication of portfolio changes to clients. Currently, wealth managers use a variety of different platforms to create and maintain portfolios and most of these platforms do not enable direct communication with the client. \nHence, by developing and implementing a blockchain solution that allows wealth managers to create and manage portfolios according to clients\u2019 stored investment constraints that also allows for direct communication with regarding portfolio changes, the entire investment process would be made substantially more efficient and client relationships could be deepened due to an increase in direct communication between the wealth manager and its clients. \nThere Will Be Hurdles for Adoption but First-Movers Will Benefit\nThe report also highlights the challenges of adoption that the technology is likely to encounter. Scalability, interoperability with legacy systems, security and accordance with technology standards were the largest issues raised by the firms polled by Ernst & Young. \nIn addition, wealth and asset management funds do not exist in a bubble and are usually interconnected with other firms. Therefore, a wide-scale adoption would likely take a long time, considering there would have to be a consensus as to what type of blockchain solutions the whole financial industry chooses to adopt. Due to these factors, most firms are currently only willing to test blockchain technology on a small scale before considering a broader adoption of the tech.\nErnst & Young, however, believes that firms that are the first to adopt blockchain technology will reap the lion's share of its benefits. As the success of financial blockchain solutions depends on its participants, E&Y encourages firms to begin the innovation process early as first-movers are likely to benefit the most.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 16}

Here I want to outline the technical building blocks with which this idea can be implemented.\nSince I see a lot of downsides to having one large uber-blockchain connecting all others, I will focus on a token-LESS solution. This would have several advantages:\nNo need for an additional token.Users can \u201cremain\u201d on their blockchain.No need to trust a centralized third party.\nThere are a couple of downsides to such an approach however. Since there is no uber-blockchain or a centralized party ensuring the connection, there needs to be enough liquidity between two blockchains to be connected. If I want to transfer funds from the Ethereum to the Bitcoin blockchain, for example, I need someone who, at the same time, wants to go from bitcoin to ether. For these two large blockchains, you will always find someone willing to go in either direction, but what about from Ethereum to a smaller blockchain or a small blockchain to another small blockchain? While I will be laying out a way on how that could even be solved, I want to stress that liquidity is the key economic factor in such a cryptographically secure multi-asset network.\nBasic Building Blocks\nLet\u2019s look at the three very basic building blocks that are needed to connect any two blockchains:\nMultisignature feature (Multisig);Hashing functionality; andTime-lock functionality\nLet\u2019s work through each of these three and combine them into a larger single picture.\n1. Multisig is an old and well-trusted concept that can be compared to a shared checkbook with multiple required signatories. A multisig transaction allows for the enforcement of arbitrary joint signature rules. In the case of a cryptographically secure, off-chain, multi-asset, instant transaction network (COMIT) one would use 2-of-2 multisig transactions for which both signers have to sign a transaction to become valid and be accepted by the network (an example of this will follow right after). This means a multisig transaction established between two parties needs to be signed by both so that its outcome becomes valid and can be accepted by the network.\nIn the picture below, a transaction was created with 1 BTC as input; however, in order to get it out, both parties (Alice and Bob) have to sign the transaction:\n\u00a0\n\n2. Hash functions are standard cryptographic concepts. These are one-way functions to convert arbitrary data (in our case a secret \u201cs\u201d) into a unique hash \u201ch.\u201d This hash h can then be shared safely without anyone being able to compute the secret s used to create it. This allows us to build a hash-lock transaction which will only unlock the funds with the knowledge of the secret s. In order to route across different blockchains, we need the same cryptographic hash function available in the smart contracting language of each blockchain participating on such a route.\nIn the picture below, someone put 1 BTC into a contract, but Alice can only take it out once she has the secret (which she normally would get from Bob).\n\n3. Time-lock is a simple requirement for funds to be locked up until a future date. Blockchains are found to have two different time-locks: relative and absolute. Absolute time-locks will lock a transaction output until a fixed point in time in the future, whereas relative time-locks will lock a transaction output relative to an event or a point in time. That is to say, a relative time-lock rather defines a time span than a specific point in time. Time-locks are a requirement for trustless payment channels, and relative time-locks are recommended as they allow for indefinitely open payment channels.\nIn the example below, someone put 1 BTC in, but in order for Alice to get it out, she has to wait a predefined time.\u00a0\n\nPutting It Together\u00a0\nIf we go ahead and combine these three building blocks, we get something called HTLCs (Hashed Time-Lock Contracts) whose states can be updated on a multisig basis. HTLCs combine the concept of a time-lock for refund purposes with a hash-lock. If the recipient can provide the secret s for the hash-lock before the expiry of the time-lock, he will be able to retrieve the funds. Otherwise, the sender can safely reclaim the funds. In case one party wants to update the HTLCs state, he needs the other party\u2019s approval (signature). This is how the multisig function comes into play.\nIn the example below, Alice put 1 BTC into the contract with Bob. Bob can either take the 1 BTC out if he gets the hash from Alice within a predefined time, or Alice will get the funds back automatically after that predefined time has past.\n\nTwo HTLCs can be coupled with each other resulting in something called atomic transactions. To do so, the recipient first generates a secret s and computes its hash h. Subsequently, the recipient will share this hash h with a sender who in turn creates the first conditional transaction, i.e., its output is (hash-)locked by h. This output can only be redeemed with the knowledge of the secret s.\nIn layman\u2019s terms, this would mean that if Bob wants to send Alice 1 BTC and wants ETH in return, they could open two payment channels (one with BTC and the other with ETH) and couple them with a hash h. Bob sends Alice BTC as long as she sends him ETH. In case either one backs out, the original amounts would just be returned.\nThe Full Route\u00a0\nNow we can stack an arbitrary amount of transactions onto each other as every node in this chain can safely use the same hash to create a transaction which is also conditional on knowing the secret s. This hash is initially shared with the sender, who will then subsequently send a conditional payment to the first node requiring knowledge of the secret s to redeem it. Each node in the route can then safely forward the transaction while adding the same condition to the transaction redemption. Through the use of HTLCs we can guarantee that either all of the transactions via this route get fulfilled or all payment channel transactions will be unredeemable. No trust has to be put in any of the nodes in the middle of the route. In the end, you have a chain of transactions which all depend on the same secret to be fulfilled. When the receiver takes the last transaction and uses the secret to redeem the money, every other node will see the secret that was used and can then fulfill their own incoming transaction.\n \n\nAfter the secret s has been shared across the route, every payment channel will then settle the transaction back into the channel. This is done by updating the payment channel\u2019s state to the final balances and then invalidating the HTLC transactions by revealing the invalidation key k to the payment channel counterparty, which will eventually make the transaction complete.\nThe time-lock mechanism is used as a refund mechanism in case of an intermittent routing failure. The time-locks need to be stacked from receiver to sender to make sure no one is able to cheat by having a shorter period than someone after him/her and thereby being able to pull out first.\nConclusion\u00a0\nThese transactions can span within the same blockchain, but can also go cross-chain as long as you find someone who is willing to transact on both blockchains. This is where the concept of liquidity and routing comes in. To go back to the beginning where we thought about connecting two low-liquidity blockchains we see now, that we actually don\u2019t necessarily transact between those two directly. By using stacked payment channels one after the other, money could flow from one low liquidity chain to a high liquidity chain and then to the final low liquidity chain.\u00a0\nThis concept connects payment channels to a large network that is now:\nCryptographically-secure (relies on cryptographic standards), \nOff-chain (like the Lightning- or Raiden-Network) , Multi-Asset (cross-chain), Instant (no need for a transaction to settle on the blockchain as updates only happen between the parties until it gets broadcasted)A Transaction Network, such as COMIT.\nIn the next blog post, I will talk about the concept of liquidity and Liquidity Providers (LP) and also on how routing through such a network could work.\n\nThis is a guest post by\u00a0Dr. Julian Hosp,\u00a0the co-founder of TenX and co-author of the whitepapers of TenX and COMIT.\u00a0The views expressed are his alone and do not necessarily reflect those of Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe author Dr. Julian Hosp is the co-founder and CVO of TenX.\nTenX (www.tenx.tech) is a Singapore-based financial service that makes any blockchain asset spendable instantly by offering a debit card payment system to its users on the frontend and by connecting any blockchain at the backend.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 16}
{"title": "Bitmain Responds to UASF With Another Bitcoin Hard Fork Announcement", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitmain-responds-uasf-another-hard-fork-announcement/", "birthday": "Jun 14, 2017  5:47 PM EST", "date": "2017-06-14 22:47:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nMajor Bitcoin mining hardware producer Bitmain today announced that it may launch a \u201chard fork\u201d in August. Labeled a \u201ccontingency plan,\u201d the announcement is a response to the upcoming user activated soft fork (UASF), as defined by Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 (BIP148) \u2014 and the wipe-out risk that comes along with it.\nAfter an initial 8 megabyte proposal, Bitcoin Classic, the Hong Kong roundtable consensus, Bitcoin Unlimited, and SegWit2x, this marks the sixth time the Chinese mining giant has announced support for a hard fork in the space of two years.\nHere\u2019s what their latest proposal looks like.\nHard Forks, Coin-Splits and Altcoins\nOn August 1st, a segment of the Bitcoin community will activate the BIP148 UASF. These users and miners will only accept Bitcoin blocks that signal support for Segregated Witness (SegWit), the protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. If, at that point, a majority of miners (by hash power) does not signal support for SegWit through BIP148, Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain and currency could split in two: a coin-split.\nNow, with Bitmain\u2019s hard fork announcement, it seems there could be a third part to the split \u2026 sort of.\nBitmain refers to its announced hard fork as a \u201cUAHF\u201d or User Activated Hard Fork. While perhaps a clever play on UASF, this is not a very accurate term because the \u201ccontingency plan\u201d will actually be very explicitly activated by Bitmain \u2014 and Bitmain alone.\nMoreover, use of the term \u201chard fork\u201d is questionable in this context as well. Originally, at least, the term referred to a change to the Bitcoin protocol that makes previously invalid blocks or transactions valid. But for it to be a change to the\u00a0Bitcoin\u00a0protocol, it arguably at the very least requires the Bitcoin ecosystem to follow these new rules.\u00a0Under Bitmain\u2019s own stated condition this wouldn\u2019t be the case, at least not to the full extent.\u00a0\nRather, the \u201cUAHF\u201d will only be launched in response to a successful BIP148 UASF. It is thus more or less assumed that not everyone will adopt the new rules, which indeed seems likely. Technically, at least, Bitmain\u2019s \u201chard fork\u201d would be better described as the creation of an entirely new coin that shares a common history with Bitcoin.\nFor purposes of this article, Bitmain\u2019s version of Bitcoin will be called \u201cBitmain\u2019s Bitcoin.\u201d\nBitmain\u2019s Bitcoin\nSo what. specifically, will Bitmain\u2019s Bitcoin look like?\nBitmain announced it will create Bitmain\u2019s Bitcoin exactly 12 hours and 20 minutes after the UASF activation, though this is configurable. At that specific point in time, under Bitmain\u2019s new rules, a block must be included in the blockchain that\u2019s bigger than one megabyte. This will automatically \u201csplit\u201d the chain \u2014 or create a new chain depending on how you look at it. All existing full Bitcoin nodes would reject this block and ignore this chain, and would continue to follow the chain adhering to Bitcoin\u2019s current consensus rules.\u00a0\nFrom that point on, Bitmain will first mine on Bitmain\u2019s Bitcoin chain privately for three days. After these three days, Bitmain will \u201cofficially\u201d launch Bitmain\u2019s Bitcoin to the public if three circumstances are met.\u00a0\nFirst off, the BIP148 UASF must have been successful enough to have gained significant hash rate. Second, there must be strong market demand for Bitmain\u2019s Bitcoin. And third, the non-BIP148 side of the split must not be doing great, comparatively.\nThen, if launched, Bitmain\u2019s Bitcoin will accept bigger blocks. The statement mentions an initial limit of up to 8 megabytes, though this is slightly ambiguous as the same blog post mentions there will be \u201cno hard-coded consensus rule\u201d at all. The hardware manufacturer does add that miners should impose a \u201csoft limit\u201d of less than 2 megabytes, which is really more like a recommendation. Additionally, Bitmain writes that there will be a new protocol limit on \u201csigops,\u201d which, in short, should counter some potential attack vectors on bigger blocks that could otherwise significantly slow down propagation times.\u00a0\nFor the longer term, Bitmain lays out a \u201cfuture roadmap\u201d that includes a version of Segregated Witness, Extension Blocks, Bitcoin NG, Lumino, Schnorr signatures, Weak Blocks, and Bitcoin Unlimited-inspired base block size increases up to almost 17 megabytes in two years. Overall, this \u201cfuture roadmap\u201d part of the announcement does not seem very concrete yet, however.\u00a0\nWhat This Means for You, and What This Means for Bitcoin\u00a0\nThe good news is that anyone who holds bitcoins (meaning: their private keys) at the time of a split will receive coins on both (or all) sides of the chain. In other words, you will get free \"Bitmain bitcoins\", which you can keep, sell or spend as long as someone is willing to accept them as payment. Bitmain will even implement replay protection on Bitmain\u2019s Bitcoin, which means that there should be no risk of accidentally spending the same (copied) coin on both chains.\nFrom a broader Bitcoin and scaling perspective, the chances of BIP148\u2019s success may have actually increased, due to this announcement. If Bitmain follows through on their blog post, it means the company will take hash power that could have otherwise frustrated the UASF \u201coff the table,\u201d to mine on Bitmain\u2019s Bitcoin chain. As a result, there is a greater chance that BIP148 miners will claim the longest chain versus non-BIP148 miners, avoiding a coin-split on the original blockchain. Additionally, Bitmain\u2019s blog post seems to have angered some Bitcoin users that were so far undecided, further increasing support for BIP148.\nThe other scaling proposal in the running is SegWit2x, which is also supported by Bitmain. SegWit2x code should, according to its timeline, be up and running before August 1st. If that deadline is met, it may or may not prevent a coin-split in the first place, depending on its compatibility with the BIP148 UASF. But since this proposal has been mostly developed in private, the status of this project \u2014 as well as its (in)compatibility with Bitmain\u2019s \u201ccontingency plan\u201d \u2014 remains largely unclear.\nAnd of course, in the end, it's possible that neither BIP148, nor SegWit2x, nor Bitmain's Bitcoin will gain much traction. Status quo could prevail, in which case not much would change at all.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 14}

If they go through with it, there could be two types of \u201cBitcoin\u201d on and after August 1st, which this article will refer to as \u201c148BTC\u201d for the BIP148 side of the split, and \u201cLegacyBTC\u201d for the non-BIP148 side.\n\nAt time of the split, 148BTC nodes will no longer recognise the LegacyBTC chain as valid \u2014 no matter how much hash power mines on this chain. 148BTC would basically just be its own coin. \nBut the opposite is not true. Because BIP148 is a backwards compatible soft fork, LegacyBTC nodes will recognise the 148BTC chain as valid if it ever becomes the longest chain (that is, most total proof of work). Once this happens, the entire LegacyBTC chain since the point of split would be \u201cre-orged\u201d away: it would disappear. Then only the 148BTC chain will be left, which this article will refer to as \u201cUnifiedBTC.\u201d \nWhat follows is an examination of the scenario of the BIP148 soft fork under a set of four starting assumptions. And: an explanation of why the game theoretical implications of this scenario suggest that rational miners will activate SegWit through this soft fork.\nThe Starting Assumptions\nThis is not the type of article that examines all possible scenarios of the BIP148 UASF. These scenarios are plentiful and as varied as the human imagination.Instead, this article takes four presumably reasonable starting assumptions and draws the single most likely scenario from there.These starting assumptions are: \n1) BIP148 does get activated, and at least some hash power is attributed to 148BTC no matter what. Or, more specifically, enough hash power is dedicated to this chain to eventually reach the point where mining difficulty is re-adjusted to normal, two-week levels. This is a strong commitment, but keep in mind that almost any amount of hash power would eventually reach this point, while producing hash power becomes cheaper over time.\n2) All else being equal, the market would value 148BTC (or UnifiedBTC) more than or equal to LegacyBTC. In other words, if hash power, re-org risks, or related considerations played no part, the market would prefer a bitcoin that has SegWit activated through BIP148 over a bitcoin that does not. Or at least, the market wouldn\u2019t mind it if a bitcoin had SegWit activated through BIP148, and would value it equally to a bitcoin that does not. (This includes a bitcoin that has SegWit activated through a different activation method later on.)\n3) Both the market and at least a majority of miners (by hash power) behave in a rational, profit-maximizing way and have sufficient information to do so.\n4) There is no hard fork, counter soft-fork, checkpoint or anything like that on the LegacyBTC side of the split. This would equate the creation of a new coin, and just make it so that users and miners can pick and choose as they would among altcoins. That being said, even in most of these cases the game theory described in this article still holds up. (Notably, Bitmain\u2019s claimed \u201ccontingency plan\u201d would ensure that it holds up stronger.)\nInterestingly, not all of these starting assumptions even need to be true. In the style of a\u00a0Keynesian beauty contest, it\u2019s actually enough if a majority of miners (by hash power)\u00a0thinks\u00a0they are true, or if they think that other miners think they are true, or if they think that other miners think that other miners think they are true... and so on.\nIt should also be noted that this article omits some nuance; for example, regarding potential hash power attacks, fee levels on different chains, pruned nodes, a possible AsicBoost advantage, or developer support. While all this may skew miners\u2019 behavior to some extent, none of it should fundamentally change the dynamic described here.\nThe Market\u2019s Options\nMore than anything else, bitcoin gains value from holders: the people and entities that accept bitcoin in trade and hold on to it as a store of value. This also includes miners after they\u2019ve mined new bitcoins and hold on to them, which Bitcoin\u2019s protocol rule forces them to do for at least 100 blocks after the coins have been mined.\nOnce the UASF is activated on August 1st, all holders will have a choice of three options:\n 1) 148BTC or UnifiedBTC\n2) LegacyBTC or nothing\n3) Both 1 and 2 \nOption 3 will mostly represent holders who don\u2019t send or receive any coins until the situation is resolved. This has no bearing on the game theory of a BIP148 coin-split, so we\u2019ll ignore this option.The other two options, 1 and 2, may seem strange to you. You may have thought that there will simply be a choice between LegacyBTC and 148BTC in much the same way the Ethereum split simply resulted in a choice between ETH and ETC. But that's not the case.\nThis is because if you choose to hold 148BTC, should a re-org happen at any time in the future, you will instead be holding UnifiedBTC. \nOn the other hand, if you choose to hold LegacyBTC, should a re-org happen, you'd find yourself holding nothing at all. \nSo holders really have the option between \u201cbatches\u201d \u2014 not just two types of bitcoins that happen to exist at a specific point in time.\n\u2018148BTC or UnifiedBTC\u2019\nWhen BIP148 activates, under the stated assumption, at least some hash power will be attributed to 148BTC. This could be very low compared to LegacyBTC: perhaps 10 percent, perhaps 1 percent, or perhaps even less. But no matter how low the hash power is, 148BTC will then \u201cexist.\u201d\nNow remember that, all else being equal, 148BTC \u2014 or UnifiedBTC \u2014 should be worth more than LegacyBTC, or at least as much. The market will prefer a bitcoin that has SegWit activated through BIP148 over a bitcoin that does not.\nFrom a pure, trading perspective, then, it\u2019s easy to see why it will make sense to invest in 148BTC at any price lower than (or equal to) LegacyBTC, especially if you\u2019re buying 148BTC with LegacyBTC. If 148BTC trades at a mere percentage of LegacyBTC\u2019s exchange rate, it could potentially offer a 100x return on investment.\nOf course, in reality, not all things are likely to be equal. Most importantly, 148BTC may find itself with much less hash power support, which will result in lower utility (slow confirmation times) and lower security (cheaper to perform 51%-attacks).\nNevertheless, keep in mind that this means that low hash power is the main reason why this investment case may not hold up.\nHash Power and Value\nIn a normal situation, where miners act as rational profit-maximizing entities, hash power tends to follow price. Miners want to make as much money per hash as possible, so they mine the most profitable coin. If a coin gains in value, more miners will point their machines to this coin. When a coin loses value, miners will increasingly switch to another coin or turn their machines off completely. This is clearly seen in the altcoin markets, for example.\nHowever, this coin-split scenario is not a normal situation. Under the stated assumptions, the main reason 148BTC won\u2019t be valued as much as LegacyBTC, is that it may not have as much hash power.\nBut this means that an increase in hash power should also increase 148BTC\u2019s price.\nAnd that makes intuitive sense. If 148BTC goes from 0 percent of total hash power (between 148BTC and LegacyBTC) to 1 percent, it improves from \u201cunusable\u201d to \u201cmore than one set of transactions per day\u201d: not unlike typical fiat transfers \u2014 just less of them. At 15 percent hash power, SegWit will activate before the timeout of November 15th, further increasing utility. And at 33 percent, LegacyBTC miners can no longer 51%-attack the 148BTC chain without re-orging the LegacyBTC chain away. Increased hash power would likely increase 148BTC\u2019s price.\nMoreover, with only 51 percent of total hash power, 148BTC turns into UnifiedBTC and will therefore account for 100 percent of total value. This suggests that a single percentage of hash power increase would, on average, increase 148BTC\u2019s price by more than a percent.\nAnd the opposite is just as true.\nIf LegacyBTC ever drops a single percentage from 50 percent of total hash power to 49 percent, it will (eventually) turn into \u201cnothing,\u201d and its value will drop significantly: to zero. By extension, if LegacyBTC ever decreases from 51 percent to 50 percent of total hash power, it should increase the risk of this scenario playing out, which should also decrease its price. And that should also be true for any hash power decrease.\nThis is important because it flips the normal situation, where hash power mainly follows price, on its head. For 148BTC, increased hash power should further increase price. While for LegacyBTC, decreased hash power should further decrease price.\nGame Theory: A Primer\nThe basic idea behind game theory is that rational players in a game can anticipate the moves of other rational players and make the best mathematical decisions accordingly.\nAs a simple example, let\u2019s say Alice auctions off a dollar to Bob and Carol. (And for those well-versed in game theory, don\u2019t confuse this example with the better-known and paradoxical dollar auction; we\u2019re keeping it simple here.)\nBob is first to bid, and could bid 1 cent to win a grand total of 99 cents. But of course, Carol could then outbid Bob for 2 cents. Then Bob and Carol could go through the motions of bidding 3 cents, 4 cents, 5 cents\u2026 up until one of them bids 99 cents. It makes no sense to bid a dollar for a dollar, while it always makes sense to outbid your opponent up until 99 cents, so 1 cent profit is the maximum each can win.\nNow, if Bob and Carol are both rational, they both already know they could win the maximum if they\u2019d just bid 99 cents straight away: they know that\u2019s what they should do if they want to win the maximum. Moreover, if Bob gets to act first, and he knows that rational Carol will bid 99 cents on her first turn, Bob definitely needs to bid 99 cents, or he\u2019ll lose out on his cent.\nThe important takeaway is that because Bob can anticipate the outcome of a bidding race, and assumes Carol can too, there would be no bidding race. Bob would end the auction with one bid.\nBIP148\u2019s Game Theory\nNot unlike Bob and Carol in Alice\u2019s auction, rational bitcoin miners can anticipate how other rational bitcoin miners as well as rational bitcoin markets will act after the BIP148 split \u2026 in order to prevent a split.\nLet\u2019s say the market initially expects 148BTC to gain only 1 percent of total hash power. 148BTC currently doesn\u2019t exist yet, so that would basically be an increase from zero to one.\nNow, remember that for 148BTC, increased hash power further increases price, while for LegacyBTC, decreased hash power further decreases price. So if one percent of total hash power were to mine 148BTC, the market should (eventually) push the price of 148BTC higher than 1 percent of the total. Meanwhile, the market should also (eventually) push the price of LegacyBTC down to below 99 percent of the total. \nBut of course, if the market now expects 148BTC to (eventually) have more than 1 percent of total price, miners should also be expected to (eventually) dedicate more than 1 percent of total hash power to 148BTC, and less than 99 percent to LegacyBTC. After all, hash power also follows price. It always does.\nAnd yet again, if the market expects 148BTC to (eventually) have more than 1 percent of total hash power, this should drive the expected price up even higher. And it should push the expected LegacyBTC price even lower. \nAs a result, we\u2019re in a situation resembling Bob and Carol's bidding race. 148BTC\u2019s expected hash power increases 148BTC's\u00a0expected price \u2026 which increases expected hash power, which increases expected price. The exact opposite is true for LegacyBTC.\nThis can ultimately only lead to one conclusion. Both rational markets and rational miners should expect 148BTC to eventually be the only coin standing, as UnifiedBTC.Now, if miners expect only UnifiedBTC to be left standing eventually, it is of course smart to switch from LegacyBTC to 148BTC before other miners do. And if all miners know that all miners know this, and all miners know that all miners know this, they have only one rational decision to make.

Scaling off-chain with sidechains means leveraging proven technology that's already available, and will be far superior to static blocksize increases for trivial on-chain scaling gains.\u201d\nMow explained:\n\u201cSidechains allow for new innovations in security models and features, plus the added benefit of faster and more cost efficient transactions - if more businesses were utilizing sidechains for use cases involving recurring transactions, they would take some pressure off the main Bitcoin blockchain.\u201d\nHe noted that there are strong indications that cryptographic federations and sidechains in general are a good solution to better distribute networks that currently hold the potential for centralized systemic risk.\n\u201cIn the case of Liquid, it will also improve bitcoin interchange liquidity, and accelerate trading and security for a large percent of today\u2019s global and currency-paired BTC trading,\u201d added Mow.\nMow explained that Liquid networks or \u201cLiquid\u201d represents a point-to-point sidechain that provides near-instant, secure transfer of assets (bitcoin initially), all while user and exchange environments remain separate from the movement of the underlying value.\nPaycase CEO Joseph Weinberg told the audience that they have been working with users, enterprises, financial institutions and others on solutions that leverage strong federations.\nWeinberg told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cSidechains become even more interesting when you have multiple sidechains from an interoperability perspective. As you tokenize the world, you see this marketplace of all assets being liquefied and then rapidly traversed, similar to how currents move liquid water around the world.\n\u201cIt's this frictionless flow and interoperability that our economy here in Canada and our geo-political and economic partners around the world are really well positioned to adopt and champion into the mainstream.\u201d \n\nStrong Federations and Sidechains\nIn order to function, a Liquid network requires explicit trust of a group of parties, governance guarantees whereby you have rule adherence and a network of many participants responsible for network consensus.\nWhile accelerating trading in bitcoin, this system will build an infrastructure that leads to a \u201ctrustless\u201d exchange for users.\nBest use cases include cryptographic assets, central bank currency issuance, land titles/registries, credit issuance and settlement between large institutions.\nMow noted that what Lightning Networks can do for smaller transactions, the Liquid Network can do for larger transactions between companies and exchanges.\nCurrently, Liquid Beta participants include Bitso, Bitfinex, Bitt, BTCC, Coins.ph, Streami, Paycase, The Rock Trading, Unocoin and Zaif. Discussions continue with other partners.\nBank of Canada Is Interested in Liquid Networks\nWhile in Ottawa, Mow and Weinberg met with representatives from the central Bank of Canada. Weinberg told us:\n\u201cWe met with the Bank of Canada and had some great discussions with them about blockchain technology, and use cases and systems like Paycase's cross-border transaction platform Traverse and Blockstream's Elements platform.\n\u201cThere is a sense that the media misrepresented the Bank\u2019s recent comments on the Jasper experiment, which was actually a well-balanced and accurate assessment of the technologies they've trialed to date. I think they're still very much interested in evaluating blockchain technology.\u201d\nWeinberg added: \u201cWe are also working on other sidechain initiatives that leverage strong federations and confidential assets via the elements project both in Canada and globally that require multi-participant governance guarantees and explicit trust.\u201d \nHe added that they are excited going forward, not just about Liquid networks but the whole interoperation and weaving of different technology stacks in the ecosystem to enable new use cases and leverage all the great layers of the blockchain stack that are being built around the world.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 15}

He is interested in the economics of money and payments and was introduced to Bitcoin in 2013. He holds some bitcoin and various altcoins.\nBitcoin exchange and hosted wallet provider Luno (formerly BitX) is developing a Bitcoin scaling solution called Moonbeam. Unlike the lightning network, Moonbeam does not require SegWit\u2019s transaction malleability fix and would be able to operate on the Bitcoin network as it is today.\nMoonbeam \u00a0aims to provide a way for multi-user Bitcoin platforms \u2014 such as exchanges, hosted wallets, and payment processors \u2014 to easily open standardized one-way payment channels with each other, and thereby offload the Bitcoin network from a growing number of transactions.\nHow Does it Work?\nMoonbeam aims to take advantage of the fact that many Bitcoin transactions occur among multi-user platforms. Using Moonbeam, these platforms can open standardized one-way payment channel contracts with one another to facilitate payments. By taking these transactions off-chain, Moonbeam can reduce transaction fees for those who use it and benefit Bitcoin users generally by reducing congestion in the mempool.\nThese channels are simple smart contracts in which one party locks up a certain amount of bitcoins for a specified period of time (with the end point referred to as the \u201ctimeout\u201d) for the purpose of sending payments to the other party. Before the timeout, the party that has locked up funds can send an unlimited number of off-chain transactions using those locked up bitcoins (until the channel runs out of bitcoins). Each channel involves only two on-chain transactions: one to open the channel and one to close it.\nBecause these intermediate transactions are off-chain, they are nearly instant. Without the need for a blockchain confirmation, the transactions only take as long as it takes to route an http request (think: loading a simple web page). These transactions would also be cheap. Only two transactions per channel require miner fees, and the rest are essentially free to the platform, though the platform could charge fees to its users.\nThe one-way payment channels used by Moonbeam are not a new invention. Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto embedded preliminary code for payment channels in the very first release of Bitcoin, and more recent protocol upgrades like CheckLockTimeVerify have further enabled this usecase. Bitcoin platforms could negotiate and implement these smart contracts on the blockchain today. \nWhat Moonbeam aims to do is facilitate the creation of these channels between major payment platforms by using the Domain Name System (DNS) to route communications related to creating and using these channels. This way, high volume platforms can easily discover one another and enter into a payment channel smart contact using the standardized Moonbeam terms. Using the Moonbeam protocol, this process can happen automatically when it is more efficient to open a channel than sending payments on-chain.\nTrust\nThe Moonbeam project overview indicates that it is \u201csemi-decentralized.\u201d It is labeled as such because while the Moonbeam network does not require platforms to trust one another, it does require users to trust their platforms. A hosted wallet with a Moonbeam address is a custodial account, where the platform is managing the funds, and credits and debits user accounts accordingly as users send and receive transactions. Exchanges such as Coinbase operate in this manner; users do not directly control their private keys. Moonbeam can be a useful tool for these services, but it will likely not be a suitable scaling solution for users who prefer to manage their own private keys.\nOther Downsides\nThe Moonbeam specification document also mentions several other potential downsides. Among them is the cost of capital. In order to open these channels, sending platforms must commit capital in the form of bitcoin for a period of time. If the receiver does not use the channel, the sending platform must wait until timeout to regain control of the funds, entailing potentially large financing costs.\nAnother risk involves the use of DNS. DNS hijacking is an attack that involves rerouting domain name requests to an attacker\u2019s server. These attacks could be used to receive payments over new channels that were meant for the authentic server.\nWhile Moonbeam does not offer the level of decentralization of the lightning network, the fact that it does not require any fork to the network may may make it an attractive solution to Bitcoin\u2019s scaling troubles in the short term. It could be implemented by hosted wallet providers as soon as the project is production ready.\nThe current state of Moonbeam can be found on the project\u2019s Github.\nLuno was not available for comment for this article.\n", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 16}
{"title": "BIP91: The SegWit Activation \"Kludge\" That Should Keep Bitcoin Whole", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bip91-segwit-activation-kludge-should-keep-bitcoin-whole/", "birthday": "Jun 16, 2017  4:26 PM EST", "date": "2017-06-16 21:26:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin\u2019s long-lasting scaling debate appeared to be heading toward a climax lately, with two proposals gaining significant traction. At one end of the fence there is Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 (BIP148), a user activated soft fork (UASF) originally proposed by the pseudonymous developer \u201cshaolinfry.\u201d On the other, there\u2019s SegWit2x, an agreement forged between a significant number of Bitcoin companies and miners.\nThe good news is that both of these proposals have a short-term solution in common: both plan to activate Segregated Witness (SegWit) this summer. The bad news is that the activation method of the two has differed, which could lead to a coin-split.\nAs of today, it seems this schism will be avoided \u2014 at least initially. The SegWit2x development team plans to implement BIP91, a proposal by Bitmain Warranty engineer James Hilliard that cleverly makes the two conflicting activation methods compatible.\nHere\u2019s how.\nBIP141\nThe current implementation of Segregated Witness is defined by BIP141. This version is included in the latest Bitcoin Core releases, and is widely deployed on the Bitcoin network. BIP141 is activated through the activation method defined by BIP9. This means that 95 percent of all blocks within a two-week period need to include a piece of data: \u201cbit 1.\u201d This indicates that a miner is ready for the upgrade. As such, SegWit would be activated if the vast majority of miners are ready for it.\nOr that was the intention. So far, only some 30 percent of hash power is signaling support for the upgrade. There is a lot of speculation as to why this is the case, but it almost certainly has nothing to do with (a lack of) readiness.\nThat\u2019s why other activation methods are increasingly being considered.\nBIP148\nBIP148 is a user activated soft fork (UASF), specifically designed to trigger BIP141.\nOn August 1st, anyone running Bitcoin software that implemented BIP148 will start rejecting all blocks that do not include bit 1, the SegWit signalling data.\nThis means that if a mere majority of miners (by hash power) runs this software, they will reject all blocks from the minority of miners that does not. As a result, this majority of miners will always have the longest valid chain according to all Bitcoin nodes on the network. Consequently, all deployed BIP141 nodes will see a chain that includes over 95 percent of bit 1 blocks, meaning SegWit would be activated on the network.\nHowever, if BIP148 is not supported by a majority of miners (by hash power), Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain could split in two. In that case, there would effectively be two types of Bitcoin, where one activated BIP148 and the other did not. This may resolve over time \u2014 or it may not.\nSegWit2x\nSegWit2x (also referred to as \u201cSegWit2MB\u201d or \u201cthe Silbert Accord\u201d), is the scaling agreement reached by a numer of Bitcoin companies and over 80 percent of miners (by hash power), drafted just before the Consensus 2017 conference.\nFor some time, the details surrounding SegWit2x were not very specific. As the name suggests, all that was really known was that SegWit was included in the agreement, and that it included a hard fork to double Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cbase block size\u201d to two megabytes.\nAnd, of course, SegWit was meant to be implemented using a different activation method. Like the original BIP141 proposal, SegWit2x was to be activated by miners through hash power. But where BIP141 requires 95 percent hash power support, SegWit2x would only require 80 percent. Moreover, SegWit2x readiness would be signaled using another piece of activation data: \u201cbit 4\u201d instead of \u201cbit 1.\u201d\nThis makes SegWit2x largely incompatible with BIP141, and especially with BIP148: Different nodes would be looking at different activation bits, meaning they could activate SegWit under different circumstances and at different times; and that would mess up SegWit-specific block relay policy between nodes, potentially fracturing the network.\nBIP91\nNow, it seems BIP91 has provided the solution.\nBIP91 is a proposal by Bitmain Warranty (not to be confused with Bitmain) engineer James Hilliard which was specifically designed to prevent a coin-split by making SegWit2x and BIP148 compatible.\nThe proposal resembles BIP148 to some extent. Upon activation of BIP91, all BIP91 nodes will reject any blocks that do not signal support for SegWit through bit 1. As such, if a majority of miners (by hash power) run BIP91, the longest valid Bitcoin chain will consist of SegWit-signaling blocks only, and all regular BIP141 SegWit nodes will activate the protocol upgrade.\nWhere BIP91 differs from BIP148 is that it doesn\u2019t have a set activation date, but is instead triggered by hash power. BIP91 nodes will reject any non-SegWit signalling blocks if, and only if, 80 percent of blocks first indicate within two days that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do. \nThis indication is done with bit 4. As such, the Silbert Accord can technically be upheld \u2014 80 percent hash power activation with bit 4 \u2014 while at the same time activating the existing SegWit proposal. And if this is done before August 1st, it\u2019s also compatible with BIP148, since BIP148 nodes would reject non-bit 1 blocks just the same.\nThis proposal gives miners a little over six weeks to avoid a coin-split, under their own agreed-upon terms. With a SegWit2x launch date planned for July 21st, that should not be a problem\u2026 assuming that the miners actually follow through.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 16}

In fact, the recent pullback on the ETH-USD market is probably one of the best and healthiest things investors and traders could have asked for. Given ether\u2019s 300% price rise in just over a month, this pullback has a left many traders and investors bullish on the ETH-USD market.\nOn a macro-scale, we can see ETH-USD had a very nice, textbook market correction along the 50% Fibonacci Retracement Line (shown in brown). \u00a0This test of the 50% line was immediately rejected and is illustrated by the massive spike in volume (shown in blue). \u00a0\nFor healthy, growing markets 50% retracements are a very common occurrence, and the market response to the retracement can be viewed as a sort of litmus test for the strength of a market (i.e. a positive rejection of the 50% line with upward price action tends to indicate the market still desires higher prices, and a negative move from the 50% line will typically indicate the market is still extended and thus overvalued).\nFigure 1: \u00a0ETHUSD, GDAX, 12HR Candles\nLooking at the micro-trend, we see the strong price rejection bounced off the 50% Fibonacci Retracement Line and is currently in the process of forming what is known as an \u201cInverse Head and Shoulders\u201d pattern. This pattern gets its name simply because it has the following, easily identifiable characters:\nA well defined neckline (shown in yellow)A break of the descending trend line (shown in brown)A left shoulder, a head which makes the lowest peak, and a right shoulderA re-test of the neckline (at the time this image was made, the market was testing the neckline)Finally, to confirm the reversal pattern, volume usually needs to increase after the re-test of the neckline to gain strength in the upward movement.\n\nFigure 2: \u00a0ETHUSD, GDAX, 30Min Candles\nThis sort of pattern is often traded in FOREX and stock markets because it is seen as a reliable and predictable indication of future price movement. \u00a0Typical price projections for Inverse Head and Shoulders are easily calculated with the following formula:\nPrice Movement = Price of the Neck Line (~$350) - Price of the Head (~$250) = ~$100\nPrice Target for Trend = Price Movement + Neck Line Price = $450\nGiven the strength of the macro-trend\u2019s rejection of the 50% Fibonacci Retracement Line and the current pattern forming on the 1-hour charts, we must then look to other indicators to give us further market insight. Two commonly used momentum indicators, RSI (Relative Strength Index) and the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), show us that the price increase from the initial, aforementioned 50% Fibonacci Retracement Line rejection is welcomed with a rising trend on both momentum indicators; this shows us that the price growth still has upward momentum.\nSummary:\n Although the sudden price drop was a bit terrifying for many investors and traders, it was much needed and has now shown the strong market value of ether. \u00a0Now that we have proven the strength in the market, it is very likely we will see new price highs in our future before we see further tests of lower prices.On a macro level, ETH-USD sentiment still remains bullish; on a micro level, we are seeing strong indications of a trend reversal from the sudden bear market over the past few days.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

This is a pure analysis of the market data.\nThe unprecedented rise in the BTC-USD market to near $3,000 even caught many of the more bullish traders by surprise. However, this quick rise in value did not come cheaply: once BTC finally ran out of steam, the market correction not only affected BTC-USD prices, but it was felt throughout the entire crypto-space as entire market cap took a massive plunge from $49B to $36B over the course of three days.\nFigure 1: Market Cap Pre\u2013Bitcoin Price Correction\n\nFigure 2: Market Cap Post\u2013Bitcoin Price Correction\nWhy Did This Massive Price Correction Happen and Where Are We Heading?\nThere are two ways of viewing the BTC-USD run to near $3,000 levels: \nThe top can be viewed as the absolute top of the market ($2,948)The top can viewed as the peak at $2,726.50 with a healthy 127 percent Fibonacci Extension\nI\u2019m going to analyze the market from the view of option 2 because I feel this provides a more sober outlook on the direction of the BTC-USD market. In strong Bull Runs, it is very common for markets to take a 50 percent correction; a 100 percent Retracement of the initial downward move (if it\u2019s a very strong Bull Run), followed by a 127 percent Fibonacci Extension will provide another test to see how the market feels in the new market highs. In our case, we didn\u2019t quite make it to the 127 percent Extension (shown in orange in Figures 3 and 4). \n\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, GDAX, 6-hr Candles, the Relative Market Top With Accompanying Extension\n\nFigure 4: BTC-USD, GDAX, 2-hr Candles, Failed 127 Percent Fibonacci Extension\nCurrently, BTC-USD is finding support on the 50 percent Fibonacci Retracement of the Bear Run from $3,000 (labeled in green). It made a test of the 61 percent line (labeled in red) and it was ultimately rejected. This rejection and subsequent support test of the 50 percent line coincides with a decrease in volume and a near flip of the four-hour MACD from Bullish to Bearish (labeled in yellow). These market moves show that, unless significant volume hits the BTC-USD markets, there is a likely test of the lower Fibonacci Retracement Lines in its future.\n\nFigure 5: BTC-USD, GDAX, 4-hr Candles, Fibonacci Retracement of Bear Run\nAfter our initial market high around $2,700, multiple momentum indicators began to reveal that, although the price was increasing, the market was beginning to lose upward momentum \u2014 this type of price activity is called \u201cDivergence\u201d and can be seen across the RSI, MACD and Volume. The long-term outlook for BTC-USD indicates a possibility of lower lows in its future. On the higher time-scales (refer to Figure 3), the momentum indicators are pointing toward more downward movement as the price is currently failing to make a new high and seeing decreased market volume. It\u2019s totally possible that the market could move sideways or even see price growth on decreasing volume \u2014 markets aren\u2019t always rational. However, if you want to know whether the price growth is sustainable and reliable, keep an eye on the momentum indicators and watch for volume to accompany price growth in the coming days. For the time being, I find it very unlikely that BTC-USD will see any significant price growth. But, after all, this is cryptocurrency; anything is possible.\nSummary:\nShort-term indicators are showing a possible move to the lower Fibonacci Retracement values ($2,500, $2,400, $2,280).Long-term indicators are showing a loss of upward momentum. Until more volume hits the markets, very little price growth is likely. \nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

As of June 15, 2017, the hardcoded wallet addresses used by the attackers have collected about 50 BTC in ransom payments. \nThe project\u2019s scope covers terrorism, as well as crime, and back-to-back attacks in Manchester and London have ignited calls for more sweeping government action to combat extremism. \nOn June 4, 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May called for \u201cinternational agreements to regulate cyberspace\u201d and to deny violent extremists \u201csafe spaces\u201d online. With terrorism in the background, cooperation on internal security matters like Project TITANIUM is likely to continue even after the U.K. formally exits the EU. \nThe call for more surveillance comes despite the fact that the United Kingdom already has one of the most wide-ranging surveillance laws, the Investigatory Powers Act, which went into force December 30, 2016. \nNicknamed the Snooper\u2019s Charter, the act requires ISPs keep record of all websites users visit for one year and allows police and other public agencies to check anyone\u2019s history without a warrant. \nMeanwhile, the EU is mulling a more direct approach to the problem of cryptocurrency. According to a proposed directive released on March 9, 2017, the EU could require exchanges and wallet providers to submit account owners\u2019 identities to a central database. \nThe directive goes on that \u201cvirtual currencies should not be anonymous,\u201d and that the anonymity or pseudo-anonymity of cryptocurrencies is \u201cmore a hindrance than an asset\u201d for legitimate users.\nThe rules would not just apply to bitcoin, but all \u201cvirtual currencies,\u201d and would effectively ban anonymous cryptocurrency, at least in the EU. The proposed directive is intended to combat money laundering and terrorism, despite scant evidence that cryptocurrencies play a prominent role in either. \nNevertheless, with or without evidence that they are empowering terrorists, the anonymous or pseudo-anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies is threatening to European lawmakers, and whether through legislation or projects like TITANIUM, they intend to decloak cryptocurrency.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 19}

With BTC1\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d release date set for July 21st, this should be possible.\nThe second stage concerns the deployment of the hard fork itself, which is not backwards compatible with older Bitcoin clients. This hard fork would double Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cbase block size limit\u201d to two megabytes, which combined with the block size limit increase brought by Segregated Witness should make for a total maximum of eight megabytes of block space. This is scheduled for exactly three months after activation of the first stage. So if the \u201cBIP148 deadline\u201d of August 1st is met, the second stage should go into effect before November 1, 2017.\nThrough letters published shortly after the announcement of the BTC1 alpha software, Chinese mining pool operators confirmed their intent to honor the New York Agreement. Additionally, they announced to include the letters \u201cNYA\u201d in their \u201ccoinbase strings.\u201d That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been seeing today.\nSo what does this \u201cNYA\u201d string actually mean?\nSignaling and Signaling\nFor each block miners mine, they get to send themselves one transaction that includes brand new bitcoins. This is called the \u201ccoinbase transaction.\u201d (Not to be confused with the company \u201cCoinbase.\u201d) Like all transactions, this transaction can include a little bit of extra data that actually has nothing to do with the transaction itself. This is what miners sometimes use to \u201csignal\u201d information to the rest of the world.\nBut broadly speaking, there are really two types of \u201csignaling.\u201d\nThe first type is signaling support. This requires that actual Bitcoin software has been written to monitor the signals and, once these signals reach some kind of threshold, something actually activates in all of these Bitcoin clients. For example, code for the Segregated Witness soft fork as included in Bitcoin Core clients, will enforce the Segregated Witness rules once 95 percent of newly mined blocks include a specific piece of data in the coinbase strings. If that happens, all these nodes will actually reject transactions and blocks that break the SegWit rules. (Edit: It should be noted that SegWit signaling doesn't use the coinbase transaction for signaling, but the block header.)\nThe second type is signaling intent. As opposed to signaling support, signaling intent doesn\u2019t actually do anything on a technical level. Rather, it's literally miners sending a message to the world, which has in the past, for example, been used to state a preference for a potential scaling solution. (While miners can also do this through letters or blog posts, coinbase signaling cannot possibly be faked, so it\u2019s a bit more reliable.)\nThe recent \u201cNYA\u201d signaling is of the second type. It doesn\u2019t actually trigger any code, but it instead lets the world know that the miners intend to support the New York Agreement. Specifically, they seem to indicate that they will be signaling support for the New York Agreement once the BTC1 client is officially released: presumably by July 21st, or at least in time for August 1st. (Though earlier is possible, too.)\nBut notably, most miners are not signaling support yet \u2014 even though it\u2019d be possible to activate SegWit through existing activation methods implemented in Bitcoin Core or BIP148 clients straight away.\nHard Fork\nThe technical specifics for BTC1 are still being worked out, and that\u2019s especially true for the hard fork part of it.\nRight now, it seems that signaling support for SegWit2x should also trigger the hard fork code to be implemented in all BTC1 clients \u2014 but only three months down the road. So if SegWit activates before August, BTC1 users should start accepting, and potentially mining, \u201cbase blocks\u201d larger than one megabyte by November. In fact, the first base block on the BTC1-chain, the \u201ccut-off block,\u201d will likely even have to be bigger than one megabyte.\nBut it\u2019s far from certain that most non-BTC1 clients will follow this chain. Most notably, the odds of Bitcoin Core \u2014 currently the dominant client on the network \u2014 adopting the SegWit2x hard fork seem slim. None of the regular Bitcoin Core contributors were part of the New York Agreement, none of them support it, and contentious hard forks have so far not been implemented by the Bitcoin Core development team, more or less as a matter of policy. And even if the Bitcoin Core development team does merge the hard fork code, it would require all users to upgrade to this new version, which is probably even less likely.\nAs such, if BTC1 users \u2014 such as the New York Agreement signatories \u2014 follow through and actually run the software three months after the soft fork, there will likely be a split in the Bitcoin network. Some nodes will follow a chain with bigger blocks, some will stick to smaller blocks, and there would effectively be two different coins with a shared history.\nBut it is too soon to say how such a scenario will play out exactly \u2014 \u00a0or if it will happen in the first place. Three months is a long time in Bitcoin terms and, in the end, neither written agreements, nor signaling intent are binding on a Bitcoin protocol level.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 20}

When Scott's not writing about financial matters, he's traveling to new places, cooking strange foods and getting to know good people.\nAs bitcoin continues its bull run, more U.S. investors are looking for ways to protect their gains from taxation, and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are slowly emerging as a viable option.\nWhile holding bitcoin in an IRA has technically been possible since IRS Notice 2014-21, which declared bitcoin property for tax purposes, the process remains complicated and fraught with liabilities.\nSome regulators are trying to fix that. On January 9, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report calling on the IRS to better inform taxpayers about the reporting requirements and potential liabilities of holding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their IRAs.\nBut for adventurous and capable investors who want to bet some of their retirement on bitcoin, there are currently two ways to get the tax protection of an IRA.\nFirst, investors will need to find a custodian to administer the IRA. Most IRA custodians allow \u201cunconventional investments\u201d like real estate and precious metals, but do not allow clients to hold bitcoin, at least not directly.\nThe alternative is to open an account with an IRA custodian that works with a fund like the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), which holds bitcoin and issues shares based on its value. BIT is an approved investment vehicle offered by IRA custodians like PENSCO, Entrust, Millennium and Equity Institutional. However, there are several disadvantages to this method.\nThe first is that BIT shares are only available to accredited investors, those with a net worth of more than $1 million or with an annual income greater than $200,000. The second is that the account owner does not hold any bitcoin directly, only shares in a fund that promises to hold actual bitcoin on his or her behalf. The third is that the intermediary custodian who holds the asset, in this case shares in the BIT fund, charges fees to cover compliance and management costs.\nFor non-accredited investors who want to buy and hold bitcoin directly and avoid high custodial fees, there is really only one option, and that\u2019s to set up a Limited Liability Company within a self-directed IRA.\nA self-directed IRA LLC allows investors to hold bitcoin directly without giving up their wallet keys to a custodian and without seeking custodial approval for transactions, but it comes with more paperwork and liability risk.\nInvestors will still need to find the right custodian. Any IRA custodian that offers \u201ccheckbook LLCs\u201d should allow clients to hold bitcoin in an LLC. However, only a few custodians specialize in bitcoin specifically and can streamline the process.\nBitcoinIRA, headed by former U.S. Mint director Edmund Moy, specializes in setting up self-directed IRAs for clients who want to invest in bitcoin, but it charges a hefty one-time fee for the service. IRA Financial Group recently announced a self-directed IRA structure that will allow investors to hold bitcoin directly in an LLC, without the intermediary of a fund like BIT.\nThere are many risks to holding bitcoin in a self-directed IRA LLC, including a lengthy list of \u201cprohibited transactions\u201d that can disqualify the tax protection of assets within the IRA.\nLegally, an IRA and its owner are separate entities and must act separately. The list of \u201cprohibited transactions\u201d is intended to prevent account owners from drawing double benefits from the IRA\u2019s tax protection.\nFor example, account owners cannot put up the assets of their IRA LLC as security for a loan, since that would give them the double benefit of tax-protected assets and collateral.\nUnder these same rules, account owners cannot sell bitcoin to their own IRA LLC and must buy and store bitcoin in the name of the LLC, not their own names.\nFor investors who own bitcoin and want to transfer it into an IRA LLC, there\u2019s only one option: sell the bitcoin, then contribute the proceeds \u2014 in U.S. dollars \u2014 to the IRA LLC, and then buy bitcoin in the name of the LLC with its own cash assets.\nAs with real estate and other unconventional investments, it\u2019s also the responsibility of investors to report the fair market value of their assets to their custodian each year, whether those assets are held in an LLC or not.\nFor assets such as stocks and bonds, these values are assessed automatically. For real estate and unconventional investments like bitcoin, a third-party assessment is usually required.\nIf an account owner fails to report the value of their assets accurately to their custodian or engages in a \u201cprohibited transaction,\u201d their IRA can be disqualified and all assets distributed and taxed. Last but not least, account owners must also file annual reports and pay fees to the Secretary of State where the IRA LLC is incorporated.\nEven if account owners cross all the t\u2019s and dot all the i\u2019s, bad custodians can still get them in trouble.\nIn some cases, custodians have failed to update fair market values accurately in their reporting to the IRS, and account owners have had to pay taxes on assets that have gone down in value. However, the potential tax savings still make self-directed IRA LLCs an attractive option for many bitcoin investors.\nAs property, investors must pay capital gains tax on any increase in the value of their bitcoin. With a Roth IRA, investors can buy bitcoins with post-tax dollars and avoid paying any taxes on their gains when they cash out. As with any IRA, however, investors can only withdraw disbursements without suffering penalties after age 59 \u00bd.\nAlthough holding bitcoin in IRAs has been possible since 2014, regulators are still worried the complicated process could land unwary taxpayers in trouble. As the GAO\u2019s report pointed out, the IRS currently provides no guidance to IRA custodians or account owners about how to properly assess the fair market value of unconventional assets such as bitcoin, even though such assessments are mandatory.\nThis article is for general information purposes only and should not be taken as investment advice. Investors should conduct their own due diligence and consult with a qualified tax professional before attempting anything described in this article.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 29}

When Scott's not writing about financial matters, he's traveling to new places, cooking strange foods and getting to know good people.\nPeach Aviation will be the first Japanese airline to accept bitcoins as payment for plane tickets, according to a statement made by the budget carrier\u2019s CEO Shinichi Inoue on May 22. Peach also plans to install bitcoin ATMs in Japanese airports as part of its bid to attract more tourism from Asia.\nPeach operates domestic flights as well as flights to China, Korea and Thailand, and passengers should be able to purchase tickets with bitcoin by the end of the year, Inoue said.\nAlthough Peach is not the first carrier to embrace the cryptocurrency, the decision is still significant.\nThree years ago, airBaltic became the very first airline to accept bitcoin payments. In 2015, the Universal Air Travel Plan (UATP), a payment network owned by a consortium of major international airlines, partnered with Bitnet to accept cryptocurrency payments for its more than 260 member airlines.\nUATP\u2019s membership represents approximately 95 percent of global airline capacity, and the industry group had earlier added support for other alternative payment options like PayPal and Alipay.\nAlthough paying for airline tickets with bitcoin on most major airlines is technically possible, it\u2019s still up to individual airlines to decide if they will support the practice. As of yet, only a handful have elected to do so, despite the anti-fraud benefits of bitcoin transactions. Third-party online travel booking sites like CheapAir and Expedia accept bitcoin payments, but precious few airlines feature a simple \u201cPay With Bitcoin\u201d button that UATP\u2019s integration supports.\nPeach\u2019s announcement comes hot on the heels of a landmark regulatory decision: Japan\u2019s official recognition of bitcoin as a legal payment method, thanks to an act of parliament that took effect on April 1.\nThe law came as the result of more than a year of debate in Japan about how to handle the cryptocurrency. The Japanese parliament first called for the regulation of bitcoin and bitcoin exchanges by the country\u2019s Financial Services Agency, the country\u2019s financial regulatory watchdog, in May of last year.\nThe new law also brings Japan\u2019s bitcoin exchanges, which handle nearly half of global trading volume, under the same know-your-customer and anti-money laundering rules that apply to banks and other financial institutions.\nBitcoin exchanges in Japan must now meet minimum capital requirements, follow operational and cybersecurity best practices and submit to annual audits by the Financial Services Agency. More than twenty exchanges have applied for FSA licenses since the new law took effect.\nEven before the Japanese government officially recognized bitcoin, merchants were already rushing to accept payment with the cryptocurrency. Merchant adoption of bitcoin quadrupled last year, from about 900 merchants at the start of 2016 to more than 4600 today, according to a survey by NHK. The rush of acceptance of the new payment method comes as consumer spending in Japan has stagnated in recent years.\nEarlier ideas to boost consumer spending included \u201chelicopter money\u201d or simply mailing checks to Japanese citizens, but now both merchants and the government are hoping that a new payment method will encourage consumers to get out and spend.\nImage credit:\u00a0https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Peach_Aviation_,MM24_,Airbus_A320-214_,JA812P_,Arrived_from_Taipei_,Kansai_Airport_(16800989722).jpg\u00a0", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 29}

BL3P, a subsidiary of Bitonic, is a bitcoin exchange founded in 2013 that allows users to buy and sell bitcoin using Euros.\nWith their expansion complete, BL3P\u2019s aims to grow their user base outside of their Dutch majority through the targeting of new customers in the EU region. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine Jeroen Rijnbout of BL3P stated, \u201cWe want to put BL3P on the map as a reliable and user-friendly trading platform for users from the Eurozone.\u201d In the long term, BL3P hopes to build its reputation \u201cas an exchange that is run by an experienced team and take Bitonic to the international stage.\u201d\nThe move brings BL3P into the EU marketplace, which is already competitive in the bitcoin space with dozens of exchanges competing for customers. Rijnbout views this competition with optimism stating, \u201cWe believe it is good to have multiple exchanges to choose from. This enables users to spread their risk, profit from arbitrage and choose a party that they trust. Centralization of the majority of bitcoin trading to one exchange is dangerous, as we have seen in the past. We see it as a healthy development for the ecosystem.\u201d\nWith their recent expansion, the Dutch company now allows all SEPA countries to buy and sell bitcoin. Their current services offer the ability to use market and limit orders. BL3P charges a fixed trading fee of 0.25 percent on all buy/sell transactions. However, for the next five weeks this transaction fee is discounted by 50 percent as part of Bitonic\u2019s 5th anniversary celebration.\nBL3P currently offers services that support the bitcoin cryptocurrency, but has stated its plans to expand support to alternative cryptocurrencies in the future. \u201cWe pay close attention to the developments in altcoins and see great value in some of them as testbeds for future developments on Bitcoin,\u201d says Rijnbout.\n\u201cWe tend to be hesitant in adding new currencies, as we want to ensure an altcoin or token has added value before we add them to our platforms,\u201d Rijnbout adds. \u201cHowever, at the same time, we listen to and understand the needs of traders and investors and we want to be able to meet their wishes.\u201d For example, Rijnbout suggested that support for Litecoin on their trading platform is of particular interest to BL3P with services coming \u201csoon.\u201d\nBL3P is the only exchange with headquarters located in the Netherlands; it holds Dutch bank accounts to process euro transactions. Bitonic uses the iDEAL payment method which ensures that SEPA customers receive near-instant deposits and withdrawals of fiat currency into customer accounts.\nBitonic is the largest Bitcoin company in the Netherlands.

Less than two years later, the platform he co-founded is now a growing force in the Middle Kingdom. Since he joined the ChinaLedger Alliance (May 2016) and announced the expansion of BlockApps, an Ethereum building-blocks platform, in China (September 2016), there has been a movement in cities and among companies in big industries all throughout China. This is in some part due to the efforts of Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, which has made it their mission in China to bring Ethereum to the mainstream, and also in part to the savvy and persistent efforts of Buterin himself.\nAt a recent Ethereum meetup in Hong Kong, Buterin said that \u201cWanxiang Blockchain Labs are making good inroads into China.\u201d Headquartered in Hangzhou, Wanxiang has led the Ethereum charge in China for more than a year. Having partnered with Ethereum early on for the Global Blockchain Summit following Devcon2 in Shanghai in July of 2016, Wanxiang is now China\u2019s top funder of promising blockchain projects. \nWith its BlockGrantX sponsorship program, it has allocated funds to Ethereum startups including iEx.ec (for fully distributed cloud computing), Proof-of-Identity (for KYC, wallets, multisig, voting, authentication and reputation systems), Golem (P2P computation), Casper (a proof-of-stake consensus protocol), the Raiden Network (an Ethereum off-chain state network) and Micro Oracles (blockchain identity verification). And this month, Wanxiang launched its WanCloud platform for Chinese developers, giving them access to tools for building applications on open-source blockchains. \nSince the recent Global Blockchain Financial Summit in Hangzhou, China\u2019s rapid technological developments on the Ethereum platform has been garnering attention. One blog post in particular, from ConsenSys\u2019s Head of Global Business Development Andrew Keys, gave some insight into the rapid rate of Chinese adoption. Highlights of the post, titled \u201cEthereum Growing Exponentially in China,\u201d include:\nThe creation of an Ethereum Laboratory at Peking University, to work on applications for improving supply chain management and energy marketsThe Royal Chinese Mint experimenting with a digital RMB on the Ethereum blockchainChinese companies such as Baidu, Ctrip, JD.com and Meituan utilizing Ethereum technology for aggregated payments servicesEstablishment of the Jiangsu Huaxin BIockchain Research Institute (JBI) in Nanjing, which Keys writes \u201cwill be a powerhouse in the Ethereum ecosystem and will become a beachhead for corporations outside of China.\u201dExperimenting with Ethereum technology by Ant Financial, Alibaba\u2019s $60 billion financial arm, to improve their global payment platforms\nIn Hong Kong, there has also been a surge of new interest in Ethereum. Jehan Chu is the founder of the Ethereum meetup there and a partner at Jen Advisors, a Hong Kong\u2013based early-stage blockchain VC firm. Though the technology is still very young, Chu has seen a huge uptick in activity.\n\u201cEthereum in Southern China has been on a rampage of growth,\u201d Chu told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cwith the local HK meetup growing by 50 percent to nearly 800 members in the last six months, and ether trade skyrocketing.

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nBitcoin just had its best month since November 2013.\n\nPrice found a top last week at nearly $2,800, which was a 200 percent rally from the ETF rejection low posted in March 2017. That trend remains immensely bullish with trading volume hitting record levels across the world, especially in Asian countries. South Korean exchanges continue to hold large premiums over the rest of the world. Even LocalBitcoins, a worldwide OTC exchange for bitcoin, broke an all-time high (ATH) in volume this past week. OKCoin.cn and BTCC resumed Bitcoin withdrawals yesterday after being under regulatory halt by the People\u2019s Bank of China.\n\n\n\nAlthough block support for Bitcoin Unlimited and SegWit remains largely unchanged over the past few weeks, UASF/BIP 148 has grown in support among nodes. Even with the Silbert agreement, UASF-supporting nodes continue their defiant rise.\n\nTraders still seem to have doubts about UASF/BIP 148 on a technical level, however. It\u2019s likely that most will not attempt to try and understand the pros and cons and just hope for the best, with the understanding that SegWit is a superior option to any alternative at this point in time.\nThe close for this past week\u2019s weekly candle was an ugly one for the bulls. Bitcoin has never broken to the upside on the next week with a wick of that magnitude on the weekly chart. Despite this improbability, price is headed to retest local highs or, in this case, ATH. \n\nShould a tweezer top form on the weekly chart, it would be a strong confirmation signal for a ceiling top in the interim with a strong pullback to the mean of trend and/or a previous all-time high around $1,300. As a correction of the multi-week bull rally occurs, look for price to revert to mean and find support at a previous diagonal multi-week support/resistance level. \nBollinger Bands, a measure of volatility and quiescence, on the four-hour chart show a break of price to the upside, a bullish continuation sign.\n\nPerhaps the most bullish sign of all on low timeframes is the lack of a bearish 50/200 EMA cross on the one-hour chart. The lack of a significant cross, which last occurred after the ETF rejection, is also a sign of bullish continuation. Price was held up by the R4 yearly pivot as well while \u201cresetting\u201d the EMAs.\n\nI view these resets as refueling for the established trend. A sufficient pullback with profit taking has occurred with plenty of time for reaccumulation. A break of the R5 pivot and ATH would be immensely bullish, signaling a run well beyond to about $4,000\u20135,000. Another scenario would be to make lower highs and higher lows until the UASF occurs on August 1.\nSummary\nRecord volume continues worldwide, showing strong demand for bitcoin, even at record highs. How a UASF on August 1 will affect price is a massive uncertainty. Although SegWit implementation, which is all but guaranteed at this point due to both sides of the scaling debate acknowledging its importance, would be extremely bullish from a scalability standpoint, getting there will likely be a bumpy ride for price. Any complications with the activation of BIP 148 would be immensely bearish in the short-term. Technicals suggest another push for testing ATH. The roadmap from there includes a bearish tweezer top, a bullish break of previous ATH or a largely sideways price action until after the UASF on August 1. ", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 1}

While bitcoin remains the clear favorite, investors are also looking at other cryptocurrencies as well, including ether, according to a new survey conducted by Bitcoin startup Luno.\nAs part of a trend that signals rising awareness and adoption of alternative cryptocurrencies, 47.4 percent of Malaysian cryptocurrency investors have bought bitcoins and other \u201caltcoins,\u201d against 52.6 percent who have only bought bitcoins. Among the most popular altcoins, ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, is the top winner with 56.4 percent of altcoin investors having bought the asset. Litecoin (7.4 percent), Ripple (6.5 percent) and Dogecoin (6.5 percent) also rank among the most sought-after coins. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve done this survey in a few other countries as well, so a lot of trends were similar across countries.

Nearly 90 percent of investors said they would buy more bitcoins if the government passed some sort of laws around it, indicating that \u201cregulation, when it arrives, will be a major boost for bitcoin and ensure that bitcoin trading reaches a new high,\u201d said Pattnaik.\nThe sentiment is likely attributable to the surge of scams and Ponzi schemes that have recently emerged across Asia.\n\u201cThere are several Bitcoin high-yield investment programs (HYIP), multi-level marketing (MLM) or Ponzi schemes that seem to have negatively affected customers in Malaysia, like MMM Global or BitKingdom,\u201d said Pattnaik. \u201cCustomers lose their money investing in schemes that promise very high returns and they harbor a misconception about Bitcoin.\u201d \nEarlier this year, Indian police in Mumbai arrested 18 individuals associated with OneCoin, a massive Ponzi scheme promoted as a \u201ccryptocurrency with a blockchain.\u201d The scheme involved investing money in a \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d called OneCoin wherein participants were promised absurd returns. \nThe investigation recovered 245.7 million INR ($3.66 million) in nine bank accounts, but a further 750 million INR ($11.16 million) was transferred out before authorities were able to seize it. \nSimilarly, the UFun billion-dollar Ponzi scheme managed to lure over 14,000 investors from Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and China before Thai and Chinese authorities began a crackdown on the people behind the scam. \nUFun made money by persuading people to contribute to various investment plans as well as purchase so-called UTokens, a new \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d that promised unrealistic profits.\nOne such scheme that\u2019s currently active across Southeast Asia, and particularly in Malaysia and Vietnam, is BitKingdom. Dubbed the \u201cMalaysian MMM Global Ponzi clone,\u201d BitKingdom solicits investment in bitcoin on the promise of a 120 percent return on investment after 20 days. A referral commission of 10 percent is paid when personally recruited affiliates invest funds. \nSchemes like these have \u201ctarnished the reputation of the Bitcoin industry as a whole,\u201d said Pattnaik. \nWhile the Malaysian government has so far remained silent on the subject of bitcoin and digital currency regulation, Luno continues to stay in regular contact with Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), the country\u2019s central bank and financial regulator. Pattnaik said that his company has delivered numerous training sessions and workshops to the authority on the subject. \n\u201cBNM has done a great job so far in taking the initiative to learn more about the [Bitcoin] industry and stop/prevent scams,\u201d he said. \u201cWith regards to policy, [regulating bitcoin is] not a very easy thing to do. I can\u2019t comment on when or how BNM will regulate the industry, but they are always in touch with us around this and we are more than happy to provide them with inputs.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 2}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThis is a re-write of A Bitcoin Beginner\u2019s Guide to Surviving a Coin-Split, specifically addressing issues associated with the upcoming BIP 148 UASF. (Update: And the BCC launch.)\nJuly 26th update: With BIP91 activated,\u00a0it seems increasingly unlikely there will be a Bitcoin 148/Legacy Bitcoin split at all. And while August 1st will see the launch of a new coin, Bitcoin Cash (BCC), this coin should include strong replay protection. All you need to do to be able to access your BCC is control your bitcoin (BTC) private keys on this day. This article includes information on how to.\nThere is a chance Bitcoin will experience a chain-split on August 1st. A segment of all Bitcoin users plans to activate a user activated soft fork (UASF) as described in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 148 (BIP 148). Specifically, their nodes will reject any Bitcoin blocks that do not signal support for Segregated Witness (SegWit), the centerpiece of Bitcoin Core\u2019s scaling roadmap.\nIf a majority of miners (by hash power) does not signal support for SegWit through BIP148 on August 1st, but at least some do, Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain will split in two. In that case, there would be two types of Bitcoin tokens, which we\u2019ll refer to in this article as \u201c148 BTC\u201d for coins on the soft forked chain, and \u201cLegacy BTC\u201d for coins on the chain that did not activate the soft fork.\u00a0\nUpdate: There are now some alternative scenarios to keep the chain as one, mainly through alternative activation methods. But for simplicity's sake, this article will assume that these methods fail. More information on these alternative scenarios can be found here.\nUpdate: There is now also more than one way in which Bitcoin can \"split\". Or more precisely, August 1st will see the launch of a new coin, \"Bitcoin Cash (BCC)\" or \"Bitcoin ABC (ABC)\", that gives all current bitcoin (BTC) holders the equivalent of their holdings in these new coins.\u00a0This was unknown at the time of publication of this article, and is therefore not covered extensively. Many of the same security precautions apply, however, so if you follow this guide, all your coins (including BCC/ABC coins) should be safe. For more information, see\u00a0this article.\nThe \"good\" news is that each bitcoin would effectively be copied to both chains. If you hold bitcoin right now, you will hold both 148 BTC and Legacy BTC after the split.\nThe bad news is that this coin-split can be messy and risky. And if you\u2019re not careful, you could lose funds.\nThis guide will provide you with the basics to keeping your funds safe during the UASF and will help to make sure you make it to the \u201cother side\u201d with all your coins intact.\nAuthor\u2019s note: If you want to play the 148 BTC/Legacy BTC markets as soon as possible and you are fine with taking risks, and/or you really know what you are doing, this article is probably not for you: It\u2019s a beginner\u2019s guide.\nBefore August 1\nFirst off, be aware that a chain-split can create a high-risk situation. There is a chance that some sort of cyber-battle will break out between the two camps, perhaps even escalating to the point where bitcoin\u2019s exchange rate(s) drops sharply, possibly to zero. Make absolutely sure you are not holding more value in bitcoin than what you are willing to lose.\nIf you do decide to hold onto your bitcoins, the single most important piece of advice is this: Ensure that you control your own private keys.\nIf you are storing your bitcoins on an exchange, in a custodial wallet like Coinbase, Circle or Xapo, or on any other service that holds your private keys for you, you may or may not eventually receive coins on both ends of the chain. In fact, if these kinds of services aren\u2019t well-prepared, there could be scenarios where you don\u2019t get any coins at all. So far, very few exchanges have given any kind of guarantee.\nSo if you\u2019re using any of these kinds of services to store your bitcoins, you need to create your own wallet. Send your bitcoins to one or several Bitcoin addresses in this new wallet. This wallet now holds your private keys.\nWhat kind of wallet you use is up to you. That said, here are some basic solutions:\nThe only wallets that are entirely trustless are full node wallets, like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots. These verify all protocol rules, but they can be a bit resource intensive to use. If you don\u2019t care about transacting with bitcoin (either 148 BTC or Legacy BTC) anytime soon and really just want to keep both as a long-term investment, printing your private keys on a paper wallet is another option. This option, however, is only really secure if you follow strict security precautions, which you can find here. Alternatively, you could get yourself a hardware wallet. Any of the hardware wallets listed on bitcoin.org will keep your private keys secure.\nMost regular desktop or mobile wallets, as listed on bitcoin.org, are about as secure as your computer or phone is. Since most computers and phones are not all that secure, these are not ideal for large amounts. With that in mind, all mobile wallets and desktop wallets listed on bitcoin.org will store your private keys for you.\nIn any case: Be sure to make backups of your keys! Most wallets require you to do this when installing: don\u2019t skip this step.\nOn, and Perhaps (shortly) After, August 1\nIf a majority of hash power signals support for Segregated Witness through BIP148 on or before August 1st\u00a0(or BIP141 or BIP91 before August 1st), the protocol upgrade should activate smoothly. In that case, you\u2019re fine, even if you didn\u2019t prepare at all.\nUpdate: Even in the case of a smooth upgrade, it looks like Bitcoin Cash will still emerge. All it requires is some hash power and/or value dedicated to this chain.\nBut it\u2019s also possible that a majority of hash power will not go along with the BIP 148 UASF on August 1st, in which case the chain could split. If you hold your private keys, you will then have both 148 BTC and Legacy BTC.\nSuch a chain-split could resolve in several ways.\nIf at any point on or after August 1st, the 148 BTC chain becomes the chain with most accumulated proof of work, both BIP 148 nodes as well as Legacy nodes would switch to the 148 BTC chain. As such, the Legacy BTC chain should be discarded, resolving the situation. It would have been a temporary split, and you should be fine if you held onto your private keys. You can now continue to use bitcoin as usual.\nUpdate: This is not true for BCC. BCC will continue to exist for as long as there is any hash power and/or value dedicated to this chain.\nBut unless and until this happens (or other types of precautions are taken), there is always at least a theoretical risk that the Legacy BTC chain can be overtaken and be discarded like this. That chance should decrease as time goes on, but will realistically exist for days, and maybe even longer \u2014 even if no blocks are found on the 148 BTC chain.\nAs such, buying or accepting Legacy BTC after the split\u00a0\u2014 and especially shortly after the split\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is very risky. These bitcoins can quite literally disappear if the 148 BTC chain overtakes the Legacy BTC chain. Therefore, it\u2019s not recommended that you buy or accept any Legacy BTC \u2014 if you do, at least be aware of and comfortable with the risk that your money could cease to exist.\nUpdate: Buying or accepting BTC is not a problem if the only \"split\" is with the BCC chain.\nBIP 148 nodes will never acknowledge the Legacy chain, so these will not switch regardless of which chain has more hash power. However, it is very risky to buy, accept or hold 148 BTC, too. Most importantly, there is no guarantee that 148 BTC will continue to be used. While that is of course true for any cryptocurrency, due to slow mining difficulty adjustments, a potentially hostile environment, and the continued possibility for SegWit to activate on the Legacy chain after all, it\u2019s probably more true for 148 BTC. Additionally, block confirmations may be very slow for quite a while, which could make using 148 BTC for transacting impractical.\nIf you want to accept 148 BTC regardless, you need to run a BIP 148 full node as a wallet. You can find more information about that\u00a0here, and you can find software downloads here.\nUpdate: If you want to accept BCC, you'll need a dedicated BCC wallet.\nOn top of the Legacy BTC chain being discarded or the 148 BTC chain withering away, there is another big risk: replay attacks.\nIn case of a chain-split, transactions on both sides of the fork will look identical. If a transaction is picked up by both 148 BTC and Legacy BTC nodes \u2014 for example, because the receiver of a transaction retransmits that transaction \u2014 the transaction may be valid on both chains. This is called a \u201creplay attack.\u201d\nAs such, spending coins on one end of the chain could make you accidentally spend the equivalent coin on the other side of the chain. Instead of paying someone only in 148 BTC, you may unintentionally send Legacy BTC as well, or vice versa. 148 BTC and Legacy BTC are initially \u201cstuck together.\u201d\nThe best way to prevent replay attacks is simple: Do not send any transactions. At least not until it is clearer to everyone what the post-fork situation looks like. It's also best not to send any transactions the last day or two\u00a0before August 1st, just in case they don't confirm in time.\nUpdate: The replay risk is more complex for BCC. If you want to be on the safe side, it's still best to not send any transactions, at least for as long as BCC has any meaningful value to you.\nAfter the Chain-Split\nIn case of the BIP 148 UASF, it is a bit hard to say what \u201cafter the chain-split\u201d actually means. \nIf the 148 BTC chain gets more accumulated proof of work, it should be the only chain to survive, and the split would be over. All 148 BTC would then simply be bitcoins (BTC) again.\nBut if that doesn\u2019t happen fast, and even if the 148 BTC chain appears non-active, a chain-split could, at the very least, linger for a while. Miners could start mining on that chain at any time. As such, the 148 BTC chain can in theory always wipe out the Legacy BTC chain.\nAnd there are also possible scenarios where the two chains \u2014 148 BTC and Legacy BTC \u2014 coexist. What\u2019s more, even a scenario where more than two chains emerge can\u2019t be taken out of the equation. In these scenarios, you will have coins on both (or all) sides of the fork. But as mentioned, it will be tricky to spend coins on one chain without accidentally spending the equivalent on the other(s). And the bad news is that splitting these coins can be a bit complex. (It will typically require freshly mined or double-spent coins.)\nThe good news, however, is that some exchanges will likely set up coin-splitting services and take care of most of the complexity behind the screens. You\u2019d just need to send your bitcoins to an exchange, and the exchange will credit your account with 148 BTC and Legacy BTC. (They should even replay the transaction for you to make sure they indeed receive both your coins.) At that point, if you want, you will be able to sell or trade your coins.\nIf the split persists, there should be wallets for both (or all) coins soon enough. Of course, you may need to upgrade your existing wallet or download a new wallet if and when this happens. This outcome also remains to be seen. Do not accept any transactions on your wallet before this is clear. Note that the situation could remain uncertain for weeks!\nFurther specifics on what to do after a coin-split will be announced on Bitcoin Magazine (and most likely on bitcoin.org and other sources of information) if and when a coin-split occurs and we have a better understanding of the post-fork situation.\nUpdate: Most of this holds up for BCC, except that it's very clear what \"after the chain-split\" means: it's August 1st and onwards.\nSo, to Recap ...\n1. Control your private keys well before August 1st.\n2. To be on the safe side, avoid any transactions a day or two before, on, and shortly after August 1st. (How \u201cshortly after\u201d depends on what happens; it could take weeks.)\n3. If there are still two (or more) chains when the dust settles, split your coins into different wallets.\nThis article will be updated as news develops.\n", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 31}

Why do I keep saying that? Because I keep this page open in my browser all the time:\n\nI had bought bitcoin at $2200. It promptly went down to $1700, and ether went from $203 to $150. The next day. That was fast.\nIn the past five days, ether has gone from $150 to $220, and bitcoin has gone to $2400. That was fast. \nIn a crypto-investing webinar two weeks ago, I recommended looking into buying the Brave browser\u2019s Basic Attention Token (BAT). They screwed up the smart contract so instead of raising $25 million they ended up raising $35 million. In 30 seconds. That was fast.\nWhat\u2019s Going On?\nSo let\u2019s talk first about crytpocurrencies. Here\u2019s the key thing to understand: six months ago, bitcoin was 90 percent of the market, ether was about 5 percent, and all other altcoins had about 5 percent market share. Fast forward six months without a neck brace, and today we\u2019re at almost exactly 50 percent bitcoin and 50 percent altcoins. The total value of all coins and tokens has quadrupled. That was fast.\nWhat does that tell you? There are two things going on:\nBitcoin Whales are Snapping Up Tokens\nAny early bitcoin miner or investor now has thousands of bitcoins. Most are Chinese. Each 500 bitcoins is $1 million. These \u201cbitcoin whales\u201d are now very wealthy. They would like to reduce their exposure to bitcoin, but the last thing they will do is go to fiat currency\u200a \u2014\u200a there they will have poor returns and have to pay taxes. In fact, what they would like to do is get their money out of China without the government knowing. So they are looking for altcoins, especially token sales.\nWhy? Because if a token comes out that will likely go up in value, it\u2019s safer than having all your wealth in bitcoins. The Chinese are buying any token that looks legitimate and like it has a chance to go up later. Their hold period is 3 \u2013 9 months or so, they hope to double their money and move on to the next token. This diversifies their portfolio while keeping their reporting and tax obligations to a minimum.\nSo the whales are effectively sucking tokens up, preventing the natural buyers\u200a \u2014 \u200aproject supporters\u200a \u2014 \u200afrom purchasing tokens in the initial offering. They effectively have an elephant gun loaded with cash. Yesterday, one whale paid around $2,000 just in ether fees to get his $7 million trade in ahead of the other orders. This is probably 1,000 times what you would normally pay in fees, just to be at the head of the line.\nIf a whale can close out a token sale and force the issuance of new tokens, he effectively locks in his bitcoin price for several months. Please let that sink in\u200a: \u200athe whale doesn\u2019t care what token it is, as long as it looks legitimate. He\u2019s watching the price of bitcoin to make the decision on when to pull the trigger\u200a \u2014\u200a any token sale that happens to look like it\u2019s going to close is simply in the way of this elephant gun.\nIs this bad? It appears to be, because these investors have no real interest in the project. They just want to see that it looks legitimate. They don\u2019t do much homework. They look for some social validation and pull the trigger. (My thanks to James Drake @EmbermineDrake and @Crypt0Leviathan for helping me understand these dynamics.)\nBut I argue it\u2019s not so bad. They are playing the role of underwriters. They are distributors. The group raising money gets the money they asked for. The fast investors aren\u2019t looking to sell at a loss, so over the next year or so they watch the price and get rid of their tokens when they have increased in value. (In the case of the Brave browser, I understand tokens were changing hands at 4 times their ICO price just hours later) This diversifies the whales and gives them unleveraged gains measured in triple digits. \nSome months later, the project reaches some milestones, the price of the token goes up, and the natural buyers come in to support the price, and if they hang on they could also see significant gains. So everyone wins. The first buyers take most of the risk, and the second buyers hang on for the long-term realized value of the token. This could be natural market making at work.\nBut not so fast \u200a\u2014\u200a everything is not always as it seems. There are pumpers and dumpers. Just buying all of a token sale practically guarantees the price will go up\u200a. It\u2019s very likely this will cause the price to double in short order, and the pumper starts dumping, going for a return in the thousands of percent in hours or days. The pumper uses the unsuspecting token as a means to an end, and the value of the token could collapse shortly after everyone else buys on their signal.\nEven though there is some of this sort of manipulation going on, I would argue that most of it is actually the underwriting model I explained above. Here\u2019s why: investors don\u2019t like to lose money, so they aren\u2019t going to sell all at once: Only if they have a liquidity problem in their portfolio will they sell at a loss. \nSecond, plenty of ICOs simply don\u2019t sell out. Of 158 known ICOs, 118 are still actively in the process of selling their inventory. More than half don\u2019t reach their maximum at the closing bell. So investors are being selective. It\u2019s just that the fast sell-outs make the most news. This, along with the incredibly durable efficient market hypothesis, suggests that, in general, this is not a bubble, this is underwriting, and there are plenty of natural buyers coming in at the next stage.\nAnd that brings us to part two:\nNatural Buyers and Speculators are Arriving in Boatloads\nCrypto investing is in the news. People can see the hockey-stick charts and want to get in on this gold rush. So more and more buyers are pouring in to feed the frenzy. This, again, is not necessarily speculation, and there is no guarantee it\u2019s a bubble that will pop. There are buy-and-hold investors in this crowd as well (I hope my readers are some of them). We\u2019ve gone from about $20 billion in total crypto-market cap 6 months ago to about $90 billion today, and many of those buyers are going to stay in crypto. They probably aren\u2019t going to cash back out to fiat after a quick win. There could definitely be corrections\u200a \u2014\u200a we saw a good one last week. But it is quickly being erased by more buyers wanting to get in on the action. Most exchanges are hiring more people to help with the increased onboarding load.\nI study bubbles. Most bubbles are not bubbles. When they pop, people say it was a bubble, but then prices go back up and then some. Was the 2009 housing \u201ccrisis\u201d a bubble? We have good evidence that it wasn\u2019t. The pop is a buying opportunity for an overheated market that went up too fast. You can say it\u2019s a velocity bubble, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a value bubble. As we say in economics, \u201cnever reason from a price change\u201d\u200a because \u200aa price change can happen for many reasons. I\u2019ll get to my recommendation in a moment, but people are quick to talk about bubbles, yet they rarely bring a sharp lens to the analysis.\nThink of it this way: whether you\u2019re a speculator or an investor, suppose you just doubled your money or more in crypto-investing. Are you going back to fiat? Probably not. I predict we\u2019ll go from $90 billion steadily to $1 trillion over the next few years. Millionaires will become billionaires, and I won\u2019t be surprised to see $5 trillion of crypto-assets over the next ten years. It is still early. There is still huge money to be made. It\u2019s really just getting started. \nIt all reminds me of the Internet in the 1990s\u200a\u2014\u200apeople kept underestimating the impact, and those who kept doubling down (like Jeff Bezos) ultimately came out with monster compound returns. I bought Google shares at $1 (through a fund) and and sold it at $100 just after the IPO. I missed 5x after that. \nThe Bitcoin Situation\nAs I said earlier, not everything is as it seems. Last week, the Segwit crowd announced victory in the bitcoin block-scaling wars. But I\u2019ve come to believe it may have been mere propaganda in an ongoing war for control of the protocol. This is why, I believe, the price hasn\u2019t jumped back up to $2500, yet the price of ether has exceeded where it was a week ago. Many bitcoin announcements are designed as salvos in an ongoing war between two sides, and they are getting increasingly non-Nashian, with each side hoping for total victory.\nWhat to Do Now?\nBitcoin remains uncertain, ether has gone through the roof, ICOs are impossible to get in on, and altcoins are all hitting all-time highs. Is there anything to do? Go short? Fear the crash? Nervously jump onto the rocket, despite the potential for a nasty re-entry back to earth?\nWhat follows should not be construed as investment advice, but it is what I plan to do myself. I already have a significant position in both ether and bitcoin. I plan to buy more. I can\u2019t know your situation. Any investment you make is your own responsibility, and you can lose substantially in any speculative market. Do NOT seek the help of qualified investment professionals. They do not have your best interests at heart; they are salespeople. Rather, I suggest that you seek the help of a qualified statistician before making any speculative decision.\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m doing: I don\u2019t care what happens in the six to twelve months after I buy something\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s noise. I don\u2019t try to catch the bottom or sell at the top. I just buy and stick it away and don\u2019t sell. I ask: Where do I think bitcoin will be in two years? Probably somewhere in the $4\u201310k range. Where do I think ether will be in two years? Probably in the $500\u20132k range. So what do I care if I buy bitcoin at $2000 or $2500? What do I care if I buy ether at $170 or $220?\nIf I were investing fresh today, I would buy about 50 percent ether, about 20 percent bitcoin, and 30 percent various altcoins I thought were going to add value. That\u2019s because you can\u2019t buy a good index yet. When the index products come from Token Factory, I will hold about 30 percent ether and 70 percent index products. I don\u2019t mind easing into these positions. I can buy now and watch for a dip to buy more, in which case I may have to pay more to get in if it goes up. BUT\u200a\u2014\u200awe can count on volatility, so I plan to watch and buy more ether fairly soon. \nI know that the day bitcoin\u2019s scaling problem is really settled, the price will jump tremendously, but a press release is not a final solution. In the meantime, it\u2019ll bounce up and down as the whales go into and out of tokens. So I\u2019m looking for a buying opportunity. Anything under $2k looks like one to me. \nBecause there\u2019s so much volatility, I don\u2019t mind being ready to swoop in when I see prices drop 20 percent. If I see the price of ether or bitcoin drop by 40 percent or more, I will jump in with both feet. As Warren Buffett says, \u201cBe greedy when others are fearful\u201d (I\u2019m leaving out the other half on purpose). I have no intention of selling; \u200aall my coins are in cold storage.\nWhat Should You Do?\nUse your head. Have a plan. Don\u2019t overcommit. Don\u2019t buy more than you can afford to lose. Be prepared to see your investment go down before it goes up. You can\u2019t call the bottom, even if you think you can. If you\u2019re really excited, commit up to 20 percent of your investable money into crypto-assets. If you\u2019re a normal, rational person, go for ten percent. If it doubles, you\u2019re fine. Do NOT let cryptocurrencies occupy more than 50 percent of your portfolio under ANY circumstances\u200a \u2014\u200a sell to reduce your exposure. \nIf you are sitting on a ton of ether, now is the time to pay your taxes and look at real estate for some portion of it.

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nBitcoin approaches a new all-time high (ATH) in price and market cap as we re-enter a mode of price discovery. All of this occurs in the settling of an unresolved block size and scalability debate set to be disrupted with the UASF on August 1. Cryptocurrencies, as a whole, now hold over $100 billion in market cap for the first time. While bitcoin (BTC) leads the pack at just over $46.6 billion, or 47.9 percent of all cryptocurrencies, the recent surge in these other coins has helped to push the total cap over the top.\n\n\n$100,000,000,000#Bitcoin #Cryptocurrency pic.twitter.com/W0519ahWWv\u2014 \u039bce (@AceOfWallStreet) June 6, 2017\n\n\n\nSince the Bitfinex hack low on August 2, bitcoin has traded better than JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Tesla, Apple, Google and gold. One of the few stocks to match the frenetic pace of bitcoin has been Nvidia, which is up over 200 percent since July of last year.\n\nBitcoin is also trading much better than all the major payment processors including Visa, American Express, Mastercard, Capital One, Discover and PayPal.\n\nThe strong upward trend of global OTC volume suggests this is not an isolated incident, limited to Asian countries alone, but indicates organic growth of price worldwide. The deflationary aspects of bitcoin are having an unquestionable role in shaping the supply/demand curve. \n\nAlthough China, Japan and South Korea are trading at a ~$100-plus premium compared to the exchanges in the United States, most of the volume in the past 24 hours has been driven by USD.\n\nThere is no certainty of a top until bullish momentum and buying are exhausted, but you can use Fibonacci extensions, previous fractals and pivots to find resistance targets. \nPrice broke the critical resistance level of 50 percent of the pullback on June 1 and has not looked back. Each Fib has shown both support and resistance on the way up, so with a reasonable degree of probability, the Fib extensions should be seen as resistance targets as well. This would bring price in the zone of $2,950\u20133,300 on the index.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, the Fib extension of the previous down fractal yielded a price almost three times the low. Using those same Fibs, this would bring the price to around $6,500 when this next run-up is all said and done.\n\nThere is also a growing bearish divergence with higher highs in price and lower highs on RSI (white diagonal line). The bear divergence can be negated with new high on RSI. Last, monthly pivots also yield a resistance maximum (R5) at around $5,800.\nSummary\n\nA new ATH is extremely likely, with continued demand for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies worldwide.Despite the heavy premiums in Asia, USD trading volume leads the rally.Based on technicals, targets above $3,000 are extremely likely in the near future. \nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The parties anticipate that the marketplace will go live in late 2017.\nPrivateMarket\u2019s strategic intent is to ensure that a new generation of wealth managers are able to access, analyze and seamlessly execute primary and secondary market transactions online. Through technology, they deliver concrete solutions that foster a more transparent and efficient private capital market ecosystem. \nIn a statement, Lo\u00efc Engelhard, founder and CEO of PrivateMarket.io, said he welcomed the partnership, noting that the security and privacy elements being delivered by Symbiont are of paramount importance for his company\u2019s success. In particular, he touted the ease of integration and fit of Symbiont with their own internal processes at PrivateMarket. \u00a0\nSymbiont is largely known for a smart-contracts platform that tethers to institutional applications of distributed ledger technology. Its growing number of disclosed users include 19 financial institutions for Smart Loans\u2122, arranged by Credit Suisse and executed via Synaps; its syndicated-loans joint venture with Ipreo; the State of Delaware for Smart Records\u2122; a major European insurance company for Smart Swaps\u2122 in the catastrophe insurance market; and Orebits, a provider of asset digitization services. The company\u2019s technology has also been used in markets for syndicated loans and digitized gold claims.\nSymbiont was started in early 2015 by Mark Smith, Adam Krellenstein, Evan Wagner and Robby Dermody \u2014 all of whom have extensive track records in the Bitcoin/blockchain space as well as in fintech. Prior to Symbiont, the trio of Krellenstein, Wagner and Dermody founded Counterparty, the \u201cBitcoin 2.0\u201d open-source project targeting digital representation of non-bitcoin assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nIn August of 2016, Caitlin Long, a Wall Street veteran of over 22 years, joined Symbiont as chairman of the board and president, assuming responsibility for Symbiont\u2019s commercialization, business strategy and client relationship efforts. \nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Long discussed how Symbiont\u2019s new partnership with PrivateMarket is designed to provide an enhanced and efficient approach to private capital markets, with private equity and real assets as a main focus. \n\u201cThe implementation of our blockchain and Smart Contracts solution will increase efficiency, transparency and the speed of the transactions in the antiquated over-the-counter market. It will also improve greatly the security of the private equity market by simplifying complex and highly manual bilateral contracts.\u201d\nShe also noted that unlike the current state in private equity, where unlisted (investment) vehicles exist, Symbiont\u2019s solution will greatly improve the liquidity of asset classes through the implementation of its SmartSecurities solution.\n\u201cWe see blockchain technology having a significant positive impact on the investment world, and it starts with the fact that the foundational document for any investment \u2014 the registration of a company \u2014 will likely soon be possible to do on a blockchain in Delaware.\u201d \nLong says that when securities are issued natively on a blockchain, not only can they be administered via smart contracts, but issuers and investors will be able to communicate directly. In addition, she says, payment of dividends can be handled directly, proxy voting will be clear and accurate, share repurchases and tender/exchange offers for bonds will be easy to execute, and the roster of security owners will always be accurate and up to date. \u00a0\nLong says that amid these advancements, there are also significant opportunities for improvement of business processes in the fund administration business \u2014 whether it be mutual funds or private asset funds. \u00a0\n\u201cAt the end of the day, all of these benefits will accrue to end investors, who we\u2019ve always said should be the biggest beneficiaries of blockchain technology in the financial sector.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 6}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nOpenTimestamps, a project led by Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd, just made sure the Internet Archive cannot be forged.\nWell, sort of. In a blog post published last week, the developer and consultant explained how he used his OpenTimestamps project to timestamp all the Internet Archive\u2019s 750,000,000 files onto Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. This means that no one \u2014 not even the Internet Archive itself \u2014 can modify this collection of books, videos, images and other records; not unnoticeably.\nHere\u2019s how he did it.\nMerkle Trees\nThe effort is an interesting showcase of the OpenTimestamps project, an open-source and freely available timestamping service. \nOpenTimestamps works by combining two cryptographic tools. \nThe first of these is a Merkle Tree, a cryptographic structure of hashes. \nAny piece of data can be hashed, which means it\u2019s scrambled and condensed into a short string of numbers: a hash. This string of numbers is seemingly random; it can\u2019t really be used for anything in itself, not even to reconstruct the original data. \nBut it can be used as a sort of check. Anyone who has access to the original data can hash this data once again, and will get the exact same hash. Meanwhile, even if the original data is altered minimally (perhaps a picture includes an extra pixel), the resulting hash turns out completely different. A hash proves that the data you have is the exact same data used to create a hash.\nA Merkle Tree, then, hashes multiple hashes together. Two hashes become one hash. And another two hashes also become one hash. Then these two resulting hashes become a new hash, so all four hashes are now represented by a single hash. And these four combined hashes can perhaps be hashed together with the hash of four other combined hashes, to once again conclude into a single hash. Etcetera. Because this hashing of hashes can continue in perpetuity, a Merkle Tree can ultimately \u201cstore\u201d virtually unlimited amounts of data.\nThe real magic of a Merkle Tree is that any of the original data included in the tree can be checked against the single remaining hash of a Merkle Tree: the \u201cMerkle Root,\u201d even without requiring any of the other data hashed into the Merkle Tree. You just need to know where in the tree to find the hash.\nThe second piece of the puzzle is establishing when that Merkle Tree was created.\nBitcoin\u2019s Blockchain\nEstablishing when a Merkle Tree came into existence is done by utilizing the power of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. Literally, Bitcoin\u2019s power-consuming, proof-of-work system guarantees that data must have existed at a certain point in time.\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is essentially a cryptographic structure, just like a Merkle Tree. But while a Merkle Tree merges hashes into a single compact hash, the blockchain merges them into a timeline. Each Bitcoin block is hashed and included in the next block. That block is hashed too and included in the block after that.\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work makes it so that each of these blocks requires real resources to mine. Right now, this already costs thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands, of dollars per block. \nThis is what makes Bitcoin\u2019s history immutable.\n\u201cChanging history,\u201d for example, by removing a transaction from an old block, cannot be done by simply removing that transaction. That would entirely change the hash of the block that included the transaction, invalidating that block. That would in turn invalidate the subsequent block as well, as it doesn\u2019t include the valid hash from the previous block, and as such it would invalidate all blocks that came after it.\nInstead, the only way to change Bitcoin\u2019s history is to completely re-mine it. An old transaction can only be \u201cremoved\u201d from a block by mining that same block again, without the transaction. And then you\u2019d need to mine the next block, and the block after that \u2026 all the way until you\u2019ve mined the longest chain. (Technically, the chain with the most accumulated proof of work.)\nThis will become very expensive very quickly. Even without any competing miners, proof of work requires that re-mining a day of Bitcoin\u2019s history should cost hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of energy. With competing miners to catch up on, you need at least a majority of hash power.\nEspecially with competing miners, rewriting even a couple weeks of Bitcoin history is practically unaffordable for anyone \u2026 never mind re-writing a couple of years.\nAnd to top if off, re-writing this much history would be very obvious too. Many Bitcoin users would notice and would possibly take precautions to make it impossible.\nOpenTimestamps\nOpenTimestamps combines the magic of Merkle Trees with the immutability of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\nTo showcase it, Todd took 750,000,000 hashes of files from the Internet Archive last week to combine them all into one Merkle Tree. The \u201croot\u201d of that tree, then, was placed into a Bitcoin transaction. He sent that transaction over the Bitcoin network to have it included in the Bitcoin blockchain. This is now a couple of weeks ago and virtually impossible to ever revert.\nAs a result, almost the entire Internet Archive is now hashed into Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. Anyone can take any document from the Internet Archive and verify that it existed in its current form four weeks ago. If the hash checks out, the document has not been altered since, nor could it have been created later.\nFinally, to make this timestamp actually useful, the OpenTimestamps team \u2014 specifically Riccardo Casatta, Luca Vaccaro and Igor Barinov \u2014 created an accessible search interface and an in-browser timestamp verifier. With it, anyone can easily browse through the Internet Archive\u2019s database and immediately see whether the records check out with the corresponding hash, as embedded in Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\n\nFor the first time in history, historical archived data cannot be altered without being noticed.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 6}

Twelve months ago, when the price of Ethereum\u2019s token Ether was around $14, a smart contract to set up a freelancer profile on Ethlance cost less than $1.\nAs the price of Ether started to surge beyond $250, Ethlance freelancers were required to pay around $8 to set up their profiles. Issues of Ethereum-based decentralized applications (DApps) and the rising fees on Ethereum led the community and supporters of Ethereum to express their concerns over the platform\u2019s scalability.\nDiscussions on Etheruem\u2019s scaling issues intensified as Buterin\u2019s interview with Epicenter, conducted in December of 2014, resurfaced, during which he characterized Bitcoin\u2019s $0.05 fee as \u201cabsurd.\u201d Currently, Ethereum\u2019s average fee is over $1 and its median fee is around $0.05, close to the level Buterin described as absurd.\nBitcoin Magazine spoke to Buterin to address some of these scaling issues Ethereum applications are currently dealing with, the rising transaction fees on Ethereum and the ICO ecosystem.\nScaling Issues of Decentralized Applications and How They Can Be Resolved\nIn regards to the issues that Ethlance and other DApp developers are facing, Buterin explained, \u201cThere are a lot of applications and contracts even now that are being built inefficiently. One major example is that there are a lot of applications that make one separate contract for each user which means that for every single user, it adds several kilobytes of data that cost a few million gas.\u201d\nInstead, Buterin explained that the same logic or contract is not required to be copied onto each other and replicated tens of thousands of times. There are more efficient ways to process smart contracts that can significantly reduce gas costs for users. He noted that by implementing efficient smart contracts, users can save anywhere from 50 to 90 percent in gas costs.\nAccording to Buterin, the Ethereum Foundation and its development team recently asked writers to reduce their gas prices and some of them have agreed to do so to ensure that users are not required to spend upwards of $8 per smart contract. However, these solutions can only last for the short and midterm. Buterin explained that, in the long run, the only way to maintain low gas or transaction fees is to scale the entire Ethereum network and blockchain proportionally as it grows in size.\nAnother long-term solution or development plan the Ethereum Foundation is looking into is the possibility of switching the consensus protocol of Ethereum from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS).\nAs it did after the execution of the DAO hard fork, which resulted in the creation of Ethereum Classic, another major hard fork could lead to another network split. Ethereum Classic is currently the fifth largest cryptocurrency in the world.\nButerin recognized that there are some members of the community that are concerned over the possibility of a split chain. \n\u201cI feel like recently, most of the people that are really against PoS have moved over to Ethereum Classic, so I\u2019m not really sure if that substantial of a community will want to make another fork or split of Ethereum once the Casper switch happens. That\u2019s just my instinct,\u201d said Buterin. \nIn terms of development of the overall Ethereum ecosystem, progress has been slow but steady. \u201cA lot of the things that we\u2019ve wanted to do around Metropolis, privacy, proof of stake, Serenity, scaling, sharding, all of those things have been taking more time that we had expected,\u201d Buterin admitted, \u201cbut I also think that the results that we\u2019ve been moving towards are much better than we thought that we would get.\u201d \nHe mentioned, as an example, that over the past two or three years, there have been improvements in protocol security that they hadn\u2019t foreseen and that are of great benefit. \u201cI think the end result of a lot of our work and a lot of our research is much stronger than it would have been two years ago.\u201d\nEthereum Demand on the Rise in Asia\nSouth Korea has become the largest Ethereum exchange market in the world with a 19 percent market share, surpassing the U.S. and China in terms of daily trading volume. China, within a few days of its exchanges adding support for Ethereum, became a contender for top spot in market share.\nEthereum is being actively developed by educational institutions such as universities and government agencies including the Chinese Royal Mint. Recently, the People\u2019s Bank of China stated that Ethereum is heading in the right direction, validating the network and project. As Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s China-based journalist Bradley Fink previously reported, some of the largest companies in China, including Alipay and Peking University, are actively investing in the potential of the Ethereum protocol.\nFurthermore, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), connecting Fortune 500 enterprises, startups, academics and technology vendors with Ethereum, recently announced its expansion into China with a new office in Hangzhou. It will focus on providing Ethereum-based infrastructure to ensure Chinese enterprise can meet domestic market needs.\n\u201cThere definitely is a fairly large Chinese Ethereum community and there are several companies based in Shanghai and Hangzhou that have been working on Ethereum applications for a couple of years. There has been increasing amount of interest in the technology and the platform. In general, it is continuing to grow,\u201d said Buterin.\nHe noted that while the Chinese community used to concentrate its interest solely on Bitcoin, that has changed. \u201cBut more recently, it does seem like more people are starting to look at both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The one thing that\u2019s made me feel optimistic over the last year is that there is a lot of interest, not just on the cryptocurrency side and buying ether and holding it, but actually using it to build applications.\u201d\nButerin also explained that developers of Ethereum are trying to match the rising demands and expectations from its investors. In the past week, Ethereum has surged exponentially in market cap, accounting for around 50 percent of Bitcoin\u2019s market cap. He noted that the Ethereum Foundation and its developers are working to live up to the expectations of investors and rising demand in regions such as Asia.\n\u201cI think the success that Ethereum has seen is definitely putting a lot of pressure on the core developers of the actual protocol of the platform to step up and deliver on the admittedly high expectations that the community has of us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an expectation that we\u2019re eager to see if we can match.\u201d\nEthereum-based companies are also coming to the forefront at a time when the ICO market is growing at a rapid rate, creating new opportunities for startups and investors alike.\nButerin was recently appointed as an advisor to the board of Primalbase, a startup that is aiming to tokenize a WeWork or Regus-type co-working space provider and grant micro-ownership to its investors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely very interested in all these applications, particularly the semi-financial ones with some components of finance and monetary value but also some components outside of it\u201d said Buterin. \u201cThe general idea that we can create this economy where we micro-tokenize and let people have their own micro-ownership, I think that is definitely a very interesting and promising idea.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHong kong photo credit: By Diliff - Own work, CC BY 3.0,\u00a0https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3963125\nVitalik\u00a0Buterin photo credit: By Romanpoet - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0,\u00a0https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=49232633\n", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 8}

However, these users are composed not only of the highly sought-after blockchain developers but also of CEOs, CFOs, academics, advisors, consultants and journalists, among others. \nGiven the high demand for blockchain developers, it is not surprising that salaries are exceeding standard market rates for developers. Today, a blockchain developer can easily make a salary north of $130,000 per year, while top blockchain developers can earn up to $650,000, according to a report by the Financial News. \nThe average total remuneration for senior traders and mergers & acquisitions bankers in London are \u00a3281,000 ($360,000) and \u00a3326,000 ($420,000) respectively according to data collated by City A.M. That places top blockchain developers among the best-paid professionals in the financial services industry. \nJosh Graff, U.K. country manager at LinkedIn, told Bitcoin Magazine: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the number of blockchain-related jobs posted on LinkedIn more than triple over the last year. There are nearly 10,000 blockchain professionals on LinkedIn, out of our 500m members, so it\u2019s a niche field, but one with strong potential.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cProfessionals in related areas such as cryptography and machine learning may want to look at the roles available and the skills they need to develop, as there is certainly a growing demand within the technology, finance and insurance industries for blockchain expertise.\u201d \nAccording to LinkedIn data, currently four out of five blockchain jobs have been successfully filled within the quarter for the past year; however, that also means that companies are still not able to fill 20 percent of their blockchain talent demands. \nThe recent surge in blockchain-related job listings is a testament to the high hopes that financial institutions have for blockchain technology. For the future cost reductions and increases in efficiency that blockchain technology promises, financial services companies are willing to dig deep into their pockets to source the right talent that can make that happen for them. \n\nIf blockchain technology becomes as impactful on the financial industry as predicted, it will not be the traders and M&A bankers but the blockchain developers who will become the new \u201cmasters of the universe.\u201d ", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 9}

He is currently an Operations Associate at BTC Media where is turning his passion for cryptocurrency from a hobby into a career.\nCoin Center was invited to present testimony on Thursday to\u00a0both the House Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection and the House Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance. They explained to both subcommittees the role that digital assets play in the world, what the future of the sector may look like, and how regulators could interact with the sector in a way that protects both the consumers and the innovators and encourages businesses in the industry to reside in America.\nPeter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, spoke to the House Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection. He explained to the subcommittee the revolutionary role blockchain technology is playing in the world around us. \u201cJust as the PC democratized computing, and the web democratized news and entertainment, open blockchain networks are democratizing financial services.\u201d\nVan Valkenburgh, however, drew a stark contrast between the regulatory safe harbors given to early internet innovators, specifically the Communications Decency Act and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and what little is being done to protect blockchain technology innovators today.\n\u201cBoth laws created safe harbors for infrastructure-building businesses,\u201d noted Van Valkenburgh. The laws protected the creators of the internet\u2019s infrastructure from third-party liability stemming from the users of that infrastructure. \nIn a conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, Van Valkenburgh gave the example of Google. Google isn\u2019t liable for a user who illegally downloads pirated material from a website whose link popped up on their search engine. This is because of the aforementioned Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which provided a safe harbor and allowed Google to continue to build the infrastructure of the internet (in this case, a search engine) free from crushing copyright liabilities.\nA similar distinction should be drawn when it comes to regulating innovators in blockchain technology, Van Valkenburgh noted in the conversation. There are two main entities innovating in the space: custodians who hold the valuable digital assets for consumers, and developers who are building the infrastructure of blockchain technology, but who don\u2019t hold consumer funds. \u201cThese very different entities,\u201d said Van Valkenburgh, \u201cshould be regulated in very different ways.\u201d\nAn example of a \u201ccustodian\u201d would be Coinbase, who regularly holds a consumer\u2019s bitcoin, ether or other digital assets. An infrastructure developer would be more like a software wallet developer, who simply creates a tool with which a consumer can interact with the blockchain, safekeep their own digital assets and send transactions. The wallet developers themselves don\u2019t exercise any control over their users\u2019 digital assets.\nThe infrastructure developers, Van Valkenburgh points out, should not then be regulated as money transmitters who must get licensed state by state before starting their business. Their role is just to create portals and pipelines through which the transactions can flow, not to direct or control the transactions themselves. If the developer were found to be misleading the consumer with his/her software product, then ex-post-regulatory punishment may be appropriate, but again, there should not have to be a permission process that precedes these developers\u2019 endeavors.\nWhen it comes to the custodial financial services, much of the regulation, and therefore protection for innovators, is at the state level. This makes it complicated for innovators to be based in the U.S. because of the plethora of different regulators in the space. Each regulator has the ability to affect how an innovator in blockchain technology operates.\nVan Valkenburgh said in his statement to the subcommittee, \u201cIn order to reestablish the U.S. as a leader we need to rationalize the chaos of financial services regulation, starting with state-by-state money transmission licensing.\u201d\nThese custodial services, the ones holding a consumer\u2019s value, should be regulated, argues Van Valkenburgh, but they should not have to repeat a licensing process 50 or more times over. Because of that costly barrier to entry, someone innovating in the space today would be best-advised to leave the U.S. and start their business in a country with simpler regulatory structures. We must regulate at the federal level if we want a simpler licensing process.\nBitcoin and Terrorist Financing\nOn the same day, Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, joined a panel to discuss with the United States House of Representatives Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance any national security implications of these financial innovations.\nBrito explained to the subcommittee, \u201c[Bitcoin] is open to bad actors who take advantage of it. Criminals certainly use it today, and we have begun to see some nascent interest from terrorist groups. According to a recent report on the potential of terrorist use of digital currencies by the Center for a New American Security, however, \u2018Currently there is no more than anecdotal evidence that terrorist groups have used virtual currencies to support themselves.\u2019\u201d\nBrito views the infancy of interest by these bad groups as an opportunity to get in front of the problem. \u201cThis means there is time to develop an appropriate response to the possibility; a reasoned response that targets the threat while preserving the freedom to innovate.\u201d\nThe main take-home message from this meeting, however, was that, as Van Valkenburgh explained in his conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, there doesn\u2019t actually appear to be much use of digital currency in the funding of terrorism. In fact, it is a bit unwieldy for terrorists to use because of the public nature of the distributed ledger. However, this shouldn\u2019t stop the U.S. from developing solutions to curb the use of digital currencies by terrorists.\nWhat Coin Center wanted these subcommittees to understand, at the end of the day, is that digital currency is here to stay. It cannot be destroyed. The technology is neither bad nor good, but instead is a new tool at the disposal of anyone with a computer. To ignore the technology is to allow other countries to take the lead in adopting and incorporating it, and gaining the benefits of it in the process. \nBeginning the process of effectively and sensibly regulating digital currency is a must if the government wants to derive any benefits from its existence and prevalence.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 10}

When Scott's not writing about financial matters, he's traveling to new places, cooking strange foods and getting to know good people.\nIn a report entitled \u201cThe Future Is Here,\u201d Singapore\u2019s central bank announced that it has completed the first phase of a project involving the development of a tokenized version of the Singapore dollar (SGD) on an Ethereum-based blockchain.\nProject Ubin, which began in November 2016, is an attempt to create a functional replacement for Singapore\u2019s interbank payments network using tokenization and blockchain technology.\nThe first phase of the project was successful, developing a proof-of-concept replacement of the MAS Electronic Payments System (MEPS+), the Singaporean analog of the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS) in the United States, which handles the settlement of interbank debts.\nIn the prototype model, MEPS+ transfers simply become transfers on a private Ethereum-based blockchain. Although it is still in the early stages, Project Ubin promises a future in which bank customers can send and receive payments and exchange currency without lengthy processing times, fees or intermediaries. In the long term, Project Ubin could herald the overthrow of fiat currency by tokenized cryptocurrency.\nIt is important to note that the prototype, if implemented, would not affect the net money supply, as all tokens are backed by Singapore dollars held in \u201ccustody\u201d by the central bank and which can be freely exchanged back to fiat currency.\nIn June 2016, the Bank of Canada partnered with R3 and several major banks on Project Jasper to develop a blockchain-based competitor to the country\u2019s current interbank payments solution, the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS).\nOn May 25, the Bank of Canada announced that a blockchain-based solution was not a viable substitute for the LVTS and abandoned Project Jasper.\nHowever, much of the code and architecture developed for Project Jasper made its way into Project Ubin. In turn, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) says it plans to make the Project Ubin prototype available to students and professionals in order to further development and innovation.\nOther central banks have considered or experimented with tokenization, including the Bank of England, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) and the Central Bank of Russia.\nIn February, the PBOC began testing a prototype cryptocurrency that has been in development since 2014.\nThe Central Bank of Russia is currently testing an Ethereum-based blockchain solution to process online payments and perform customer verification. President Vladimir Putin met with Ethereum\u2019s creator Vitalik Buterin at the St. Petersburg Economic Forum last week and reportedly encouraged efforts to advance blockchain technology in Russia.\nMany other countries are already on the blockchain bandwagon; however, if Singapore\u2019s project is fully implemented, it would mark the first tokenized fiat currency and the first blockchain-based interbank payments system.\nBut Project Ubin is not over yet. The first phase was successfully completed on March 9, and the report only summarizes its conclusions and outlines the goals of the second phase.\nThe project\u2019s next goal, according to the report, will be to test the viability of a tokenized blockchain-based solution to domestic and international securities transactions \u2014 such as the global stock exchange \u2014 and cross-border interbank payments.", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 12}

And yet many people don\u2019t know how to buy a single bitcoin. If you are new to digital assets, you may find it a tap dance just to get your money in, between digital wallets, online exchanges and questionable regulations. If you are perplexed by blockchain technology and feel more comfortable having your money in traditional markets, there are companies you can invest in to get the technology in your portfolio. Companies like IBM and Microsoft are betting heavily on blockchain tech, and are positioning themselves as leaders for the Internet of Everything.\nHere are some familiar, publicly traded companies that have invested in blockchain technology: \nMicrosoft (MSFT), Nasdaq\u00a0\nMicrosoft has been sponsoring blockchain technology and is now a founding member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), along with dozens of other companies including J.P. Morgan and Toyota. The alliance was formed to create standards for Ethereum in business use cases and to collaborate for a blockchain-based online marketplace. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing service platform also supports Ethereum, offering Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) tools for app developers. \nQuoted in the MIT Technology Review, Marley Gray, who leads Microsoft\u2019s blockchain efforts, said, \u201cWe see a huge opportunity here. Enterprise-scale and enterprise-grade infrastructure is going to be vitally important for this financial infrastructure that will be woven using blockchain over these next few years.\u201d \nAs Microsoft adds development tools and industry expertise, its early bets on blockchain tech should grow in years to come. The stock is now sitting at a 52-week high in the $72 range, with a trailing annual dividend of $1.53 per share.\nIBM (IBM), NYSE\u00a0\nWith a different approach, IBM has joined Hyperledger in its foray onto the blockchain. Governed by corporations, Hyperledger has five blockchain and distributed ledger projects in incubation. The one that IBM is most invested in is called Fabric, a blockchain layer for enterprise solutions, which also has support from companies including Accenture, Airbus, American Express, CME Group, Intel and others.\nIn 2016, IBM focused specifically on introducing blockchain technology to the company\u2019s artificially intelligent computer named Watson. Potential applications include machine-to-machine communications and payments, machine self-diagnostics, and machine self-learning.\nSimilar to the Microsoft Azure developer platform, IBM also offers blockchain building tools for corporations. Shares of IBM are now trading around $152, with a trailing annual dividend of $1.40 per share.\nOverstock.com (OSTK), Nasdaq \u00a0\nIn 2014, Overstock.com started a VC fund to manage investments in firms leveraging blockchain technology. Named Medici Ventures, the fund now owns a 2.5 percent stake in Factom, which may become a leading data hashing company. And in April 2017, Medici invested $428,000 in Bitcoin company Ripio, a leading digital wallet and exchange in Argentina. Medici has also invested in several platforms related to equity trading. \nOverstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne has long been a proponent of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. In 2016, he announced a new subsidiary blockchain-based equity trading platform named t0, which he thinks could revolutionize equity trading. t0 combines cryptographically secure distributed ledgers with existing market processes to reduce time and costs, and increase transparency, efficiency and auditability.\nMedici continues to invest in promising blockchain startups. The company\u2019s stock is trading in the $14.50 range, with a market cap of only $363 million. \nFastForward Innovations (FFWD.L), London Stock Exchange \u00a0\nFastForward Innovations is a VC firm investing in emerging technologies. In 2015 FastForward made a \u00a3279,000 ($431,300) investment in Factom, which in 2016 was revalued at \u00a3560,000 ($709,800) after another successful funding round. The latter round included funds from well-known investor Tim Draper, who stated, \u201cGovernments also need better security from hackers, and the blockchain avails them of better security than they currently have. I believe that the Factom team has the opportunity and the potential to build a company greater than Oracle and Palantir and IBM combined.\u201d\nFastForward is also invested in digital gaming, wearable technology and online media. The company\u2019s stock is currently trading at \u00a312.65 ($16.24).\nBitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), OTC \u00a0\nIf you want exposure to bitcoin and only bitcoin, you can buy into the Bitcoin Investment Trust through your traditional brokerage account. A financial product of Grayscale, which is owned by Digital Currency Group, GBTC is meant to track the bitcoin market price on behalf of investors, who then don\u2019t have to buy and safekeep bitcoins for themselves. \nThe fund\u2019s bitcoins are kept in deep storage vaults with Bitcoin company Xapo, where they are protected by intense cryptographic and physical security. With $390 million in assets under management, the fund has a market cap of $882 million on Yahoo Finance. Recently, the price of the fund has soared above the market price of bitcoin, which shows an active demand for a bitcoin investment vehicle. Currently trading at $516, GBTC is up from $101 just six months ago.\nBlockchain Capital\u00a0\u00a0\nThough not publicly traded, if you would like to dabble in digital assets but don\u2019t know which projects to invest in, Blockchain Capital offers an interesting way to play this space. Calling themselves the \u201cFirst Ever Digital Liquid Venture Firm,\u201d Blockchain Capital invests in promising blockchain projects and the platforms that support them, and now has what looks to be a strong portfolio. Their holdings include industry leaders Blockstream, Bitfury, Coinbase, Ripple, ShapeShift, BitPesa and more.\nWhat is unique about Blockchain Capital is that they have their own digital token called BCAP, which represents an indirect fraction of non-voting interest in their Digital Liquid Venture Fund. By buying the BCAP tokens, you will own a share of the fund of companies that Blockchain Capital invests in. When the fund released these tokens to the public earlier this year, the entire offering of 10 million BCAP sold out in less than six hours, raising a total of $10 million USD at $1 per token. Today the token trades on Liqui.io for $2.25.\nThis article is for general information purposes only and should not be taken as investment advice.

The funds allocated toward the discounted transaction fees will be \u201csubsidized by the BTC.com Wallet.\u201d \u00a0\nThe new service comes at a time when transaction fees on the Bitcoin network are reaching all-time highs. \nSpeaking on recent transaction fees reaching all-time highs, and how it may impact potential Bitcoin adopters, BTC.com\u2019s Alejandro De La Torre told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cThe effect of rising tx costs mostly affects the perception of bitcoin to new users. They might think it\u2019s too expensive or might use a low tx fee and have their bitcoin transaction confirm in a very long time. Both scenarios are not good for adoption.\u201d \nThis is not the first time that bitcoin wallets have offered discounted transaction fees. \u201cMany wallets have previously paid for transaction fees on behalf of users, but stopped doing so recently (such as Coinbase and Xapo),\u201d said De La Torre.\nBTC.com is currently the only bitcoin wallet that also serves as a fully operational mining pool, currently controlling approximately 7 percent of hash power on the Bitcoin network. \n\nThe Scalability Problem\nThe Bitcoin community has been embroiled in arguments over the best solution to scale the network for years now. Perhaps the most popular solution is Segregated Witness, a soft fork protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. Bitmain in particular has explicitly stated their refusal to implement SegWit if it\u2019s not combined with a hard fork increase of the block size limit, and its pools \u2014 which include the BTC.com mining pool \u2014 have enough signaling power to block SegWit\u2019s activation. \nAs for solutions to the scalability issue, \u201cBTC.com is supporting Segwit2x.\u201d Segwit2x is a hybrid of the solutions proposed above: It implements SegWit followed six months later by a hard fork increase in the block size limit from 1 to 2 MB. \nIf the Bitcoin community is unable to agree on a solution to the scalability issue, the growth potential of the network limits its application. \u201cWe need to work together and stop bickering,\u201d says De La Torre, \u201cThere are some good scaling options on the table.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 8}

The new additions increased the startup\u2019s partner bank network to 58 banks and credit unions in the U.S.\nTo provide its low-cost cross-border payment service, bridge21 leverages bitcoin to process the money transfers, while its customers deal purely in fiat currency. That means that users will decide on the amount of U.S. dollars they want to send to Mexico or the amount of Mexican pesos they want their recipients to receive. Once the user has agreed to the conversion rate and has initiated the transfer on bridge21\u2019s platform, the startup then buys bitcoin in the U.S. with dollars and sells them for pesos in Mexico.\nAlso, as bridge21 uses bitcoin instead of the banking network to conduct its cross-border payments, it can do so at a much lower cost which results in better exchange rates for its customers and a 1 percent fee per money transfer. According to the startup, bridge21 manages to provide savings of over 5 percent compared to their competition.\n\u201cLast week we consistently offered 14 percent better than mid-market rates for large amounts,\u201d said Will Madden, bridge21\u2019s founder and CEO, in statement on June 1, 2017.\nSince the launch of its U.S. to Mexico money transfer service, bridge21 has integrated BitGo Instant to increase the turnaround time of its transactions. \nThe \u201cTrump Boost\u201d for U.S.-Mexico Remittances\nIn light of President Trump\u2019s plans to build a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico and his suggestion to fund the wall by heavily taxing or fully prohibiting U.S.-to-Mexico cross-border payments to keep the necessary funds in the country, money transfer operations have witnessed a sharp increase in U.S. to Mexico remittances.\nA record number of money transfers have been conducted from the U.S. to Mexico between late 2016 and early 2017 in anticipation of potential policy changes by the Trump Administration that could restrict the flow of money across the border. As U.S.-based Mexican migrant workers send around $26 billion a year back home to their families, it is an important source of income for the Mexican economy.\nThe recent surge in U.S.-to-Mexico remittances, combined with an increasing demand for low-cost money transfer options, should bode well for bridge21 and other bitcoin remittance startups that are looking to service this economically important remittance pathway.\nOn the Horizon for bridge21\nMadden told Bitcoin Magazine that the next step for bridge21 will be in remittances from Mexico to the U.S \u201cgoing in the other direction, assuming we can tackle some regulatory challenges. Customers are demanding it and the total addressable market is enormous, nearly $300 billion annually. Also, when our Bridge Rate is bad in one direction it is good in the other. This means we can take full advantage of our Mexico rail without much work.\u201d\nOutside of Mexico, Madden is eyeing remittances between the United Kingdom and the U.S in both directions. \u201cThe U.K. Department for International Trade has opened a lot of doors for us and helped us to make the inroads necessary to expand there quickly and efficiently. We feel that the U.K. is very accommodating to financial technology companies. There\u2019s a huge opportunity to connect the U.S. and U.K. banking systems with bitcoin.\u201d\nAside from Mexico and the U.K., bridge21 is also planning to target large remittance markets in Asia and wants to expand into Europe and South America.\n\u201cAlso on the list in no particular order are the Philippines, India, the EU and more countries throughout the Americas. China is a massive opportunity, but we\u2019re not jumping in head first. We piloted there earlier in the year but backed out. There is too much regulatory uncertainty and the market is saturated.

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nBitcoin and Ethereum continue to push all-time highs (ATHs) by most available metrics: price, market capitalization, daily traded volume, hash rate, transactions per day, etc.\n\nThere appears to be a multifactorial convergence of fundamentals and technicals allowing for this surge to happen:\n1. On-ramps\nSpecifically Coinbase for U.S. citizens, which now allows new users to purchase bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) or litecoin. Leading up to and even during the 2013 bubble, purchasing cryptocurrency was difficult for the average user. Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks cause a slight lag in on-ramping by limiting the total coins a new user can purchase. I expect the fuel for this rally to continue for at least another week.\n2. Visibility in mainstream and popular media\nAt this point, you cannot use any social media or news source without hearing about Bitcoin. Everyone I\u2019ve spoken with outside of the Bitcoinosphere is aware of its existence. Although purely anecdotal, this trend suggests Bitcoin is gaining visibility. \u00a0\n3. ICOmania\nInitial coin offerings (ICOs), similar to IPOs, allow for a company or brand to tokenize its assets through crowdfunding, most of which are done on the Ethereum blockchain. The quantity and rate of new ICOs remind many traders of the dot-com bubble due to large influxes of cash for almost every project. \u00a0\u00a0\n4. An agreement on the block size debate\nThe ongoing block size and scalability debate was stifling innovation surrounding Bitcoin. On Monday, it was announced that Barry Silbert and Bitcoin Unlimited proponents reached an agreement to activate SegWit now and hard fork in four months. Members of the Bitcoin Core community were not involved in the discussion. Shaolinfry, the user-activated soft fork (UASF) dev, had this to say regarding the agreement. UASF nodes continue to increase, despite the agreement. \nTo be clear, the proposal, as far as I can see, does not activate BIP 141, but is a completely new deployment that would be incompatible with the BIP 141 deployment. I\u2019m not sure how that can be considered \u201cimmediate\u201d activation. - Shaolinfry\n\n5. Prices were already pushing ATHs \u00a0\nTrend since 2015 has been bullish with several periods of extended consolidation. Price continues to break ATHs in large part due to further bullish technicals and market structure with every pullback/correction. Whether or not current price represents a bubble or euphoria is a bit irrelevant. What is more important is to look for signs of exhaustion. One such sign of exhaustion would be a toppy chart pattern such as an M double top or growing bearish divergence on a weekly chart. \nBitcoin\n\nA bear div would consist of a higher high in price and a lower high on RSI, a measure of momentum. This would suggest lack of strength holding up price. In the case of BTC, however, there has been a steady increase in volume since the beginning of the year.\n\nAs price continues to break ATHs almost daily, we can expect a large increase in volatility and range expansion, especially because there is no previous market structure at these levels. However, there are indicators that help determine support and resistance levels above ATH levels, the most common being Fibonacci extensions. Drawn from previous ATH to low, this would yield a target of ~$2,400.\n\nOn a low timeframe, you can see yesterday\u2019s $200+ volatility, which quickly rallied 50 percent of the drop. \n\nThe current immediate target is the local top of $2,248.\nEthereum\nEthereum, on the other hand, is beginning to show signs of exhaustion. The weekly chart is showing a decline in volume since March, with ETH/USD pushing the top limit of RSI, and the ETH/BTC pair showing bear div. \n\n\nStructure currently has all the makings of an M double top. I would expect another retest of the previous consolidation level before moving higher. if Bitcoin makes a push past $2,400, however, it may drag up Ethereum with it as well.\n\nThe upside target should be between $198 and $217 according to Fibonacci extensions. \n\nSummary\nBitcoin and Ethereum continue to push the envelope for almost every available metric and show little signs of slowing. Reliable on-ramping coupled with awareness and popularity continue to fuel demand.Despite several weeks of large gains, the possibility of continuing to further ATHs for Bitcoin remains high.With declining volume and a growing bear div on high timeframes, Ethereum is beginning to show signs of slowing.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 23}
{"title": "DCG\u2019s Bitcoin Scaling Proposal and What it Needs to Succeed", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/dcgs-scaling-proposal-and-what-it-needs-succeed/", "birthday": "May 24, 2017  3:11 PM EST", "date": "2017-05-24 20:11:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nSpearheaded by Barry Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group (DCG),\u00a0\u00a0this week\u00a0over 50 companies signed and published a \u201cBitcoin Scaling Agreement\u201d\u00a0on Medium. The agreement intends to put an end to Bitcoin\u2019s long-lasting scaling debate. Whether it actually will is a another question.\nHere\u2019s what the agreement entails, how it compares to existing scaling proposals and what it requires to succeed \u2026\nWhat the Agreement Entails\nThe DCG agreement is based on the \u201cSegWit2MB\u201d proposal, originally floated by RSK Founder and Chief Scientist Sergio Demian Lerner. This proposal couples activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit), the centrepiece of Bitcoin Core\u2019s scaling roadmap, with an added block-size-increase hard fork down the road. While SegWit itself offers an increase to two to four megabytes, the added hard fork should double this to a maximum of eight megabytes. \nAccording to the Medium post, the soft fork will be activated \u201cat an 80% threshold,\u201d (presumably) referring to hash power. And the hard fork will be activated \u201cwithin six months.\u201d\nHowever, it seems that different signatories have different interpretations of what this actually means. Some claim that SegWit will be activated as a soft fork first, followed by a separate block-size-increase hard fork later. Others suggest that the soft fork will come first, but in such a way that it would trigger hard fork code, which still activates later. Yet others suggest that both the soft fork and the hard fork will be activated at the same time. And some even think the hard fork will come first, followed by SegWit activation later.\nWhile these kinds of details may still need to be worked out, over 50 companies signed the agreement. Combined, they currently represent more than 80 percent of hash power on the network and, according to these companies, $5.1 billion USD in transaction volume as well as 20.5 million Bitcoin wallets.\nBut there are telling omissions, too. Perhaps most notably, no Bitcoin Core developer is party to the agreement, nor were any of them even present at the meeting. Similarly, none of the entities that fund Bitcoin Core developers \u2014 like Chaincode Labs, Blockstream or MIT\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative \u2014 signed on. And of course, some 50 companies are only a segment of the Bitcoin industry in the first place; several big players are still missing.\nLast but not least, Bitcoin\u2019s broader user base is not involved with the agreement either, nor is the agreement in any way tied to community support.\nHow the Agreement Compares to Existing Scaling Solutions\nLike the DCG agreement, Bitcoin Core\u2019s scaling roadmap includes Segregated Witness as well. It also suggests that a hard fork to further increase the block size limit could be needed in the future, though it does not specify a specific point in time. Most Bitcoin Core developers also believe that a hard fork requires at least a year to prepare, perhaps more. As such, both Bitcoin Core and the DCG agreement share activation of SegWit as a first step in their scaling plans \u2014 but not the hard fork part.\nHowever, the SegWit activation mechanism that is part of the DCG agreement slightly differs from the current activation mechanism implemented in Bitcoin Core. Most important, the DCG agreement lowers the required hash power threshold from 95 to 80 percent. And because of how SegWit is designed, activation through the DCG agreement is incompatible with all SegWit-ready Bitcoin nodes on the network.\nIt may be possible to work around this issue, however. As proposed by Bitmain Warranty engineer James Hilliard, SegWit activation can be made compatible between the DCG agreement and Bitcoin Core, though it\u2019s a bit \u201chacky.\u201d In short, if miners signal support for SegWit along the DCG agreement with at least 80 percent of hash power, this 80 percent can also start to completely reject any block that does not signal support for SegWit. This activates the current SegWit proposal by Bitcoin Core, as that would reach its 95 percent threshold as well.\nDown the road, the DCG agreement\u2019s hard fork is very unlikely to be implemented in Bitcoin Core for a number of reasons, but most importantly because it is contentious.\nOther scaling proposals, like Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s Emergent Consensus or Bcoin\u2019s Extension Blocks, are not necessarily incompatible with the DCG agreement, or at least they don\u2019t need to be.\nWhat the Agreement Requires to Succeed\nWhat the agreement requires to succeed depends on your concept of \u201csuccess.\u201d But it will be a challenge by any definition.\nFirst off, it should be noted that the proposal \u2014 which allows for blocks of up to 8 megabytes \u2014 may not be safe. While the full extent of the block size issue is outside the scope of this article, suffice it to say that some\u00a0think that 8 megabyte blocks are, in fact, a significant risk.\nPerhaps even more important, code needs to be written, and it is not yet clear who will actually do this. Moreover, this code should really be reviewed and tested extensively: the plan is to have it carry billions of dollars\u2019 worth of value. This will not be easy to do within six months; perhaps impossible.\nThen, this code must be brought into production. For the hard fork in particular, this means that everyone effectively needs to integrate and switch to the new protocol. If all signatories of the agreement accomplish this, it would probably be sufficient to at least get this new protocol running.\nIt seems obvious that the signatories of the DCG agreement hope that the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem will also switch to the new protocol once the fork takes place. In that case, the new protocol would (probably) be considered the new \"Bitcoin\u201d by everyone. \nBut given the contention of the proposed hard fork, this currently seems very unlikely. \nWhile it\u2019s impossible to predict the future, it seems almost certain that at least some segment of Bitcoin developers, miners, companies and \u2014 most important \u2014 users will reject the fork. They will stay put on the existing protocol even if that means it takes much longer for blocks to confirm, or they will roll out a user activated soft fork, or perhaps they will even deploy a counter\u2013hard fork. Under any of these scenarios, the Bitcoin blockchain would \u201csplit\u201d into two chains, or more.\nThe real challenge, therefore, is to get people to use the new chain. And, if that is desired, to get them to consider it the \u201creal\u201d Bitcoin. This will probably be a much harder challenge than forking itself, even for all the companies involved in the DCG agreement.\nAnd most important, for the agreement to succeed in any way at all (perhaps even under a different name than \u201cBitcoin\u201d), it will require the signatories to follow through. The Bitcoin protocol is difficult to change, and promises or Medium posts alone don\u2019t have any impact on it whatsoever, as several similar commitments have proven in the past.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 24}
{"title": "These Two UASFs Could Activate SegWit", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bip-148-and-bip-149-two-uasfs-activate-segwit/", "birthday": "May 23, 2017  12:13 PM EST", "date": "2017-05-23 17:13:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nSegregated Witness (SegWit), the Bitcoin protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team, was originally designed to activate via the Bitcoin Improvement Protocol 9 (BIP 9) standard, a hash-power signalling mechanism. This would allow the Bitcoin ecosystem to coordinate the upgrade relatively safely through miner readiness.\nBut with the SegWit proposal in particular, BIP 9 no longer serves just to signal readiness. Miners as well as users increasingly see BIP 9 as a sort of miner vote on the desirability of the protocol upgrade. And some miners even seem to utilize it as a negotiation chip for protocol development.\nThe pseudonymous developer who goes by the name \u201cShaolinfry\u201d considers this an abuse of the coordination mechanism. He therefore recently proposed an alternative activation scheme: a user-activated soft fork, better known as a \u201cUASF.\u201d\nShaolinfry also drafted two specific UASF proposals: BIP 148 and BIP 149. Both of these are currently \u201cin the running\u201d for user adoption. And speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Shaolinfry, at least, seems sure that one of them will be accepted by the network.\n\u201cThere is no universe in which SegWit will not get activated.\u201d\nSegWit and the UASF\nA soft fork is a change to the Bitcoin protocol that introduces new rules or tightens existing ones. This makes soft forks backward compatible: nodes that did not upgrade should remain part of the same Bitcoin network.\nSegregated Witness is a soft fork that would increase Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit and solve some longstanding protocol issues. While it\u2019s always hard to say with conclusive certainty, the proposal seems to have broad support within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Many wallets, exchanges and other companies in the space have indicated they are ready for it, while an overwhelming share of reachable nodes on the network have implemented the solution, too. \nAs per BIP 9, the current implementation of SegWit activates if about 95 percent of hash power signals support within a two-week difficulty period before November. However, hash power support has so far stagnated at around 30 percent.\nThis apparent mismatch between the ecosystem and hash power support is why some \u2014 like BIP 9 co-author Rusty Russell \u2014 are increasingly thinking the activation method was a mistake.\nAnd Shaolinfry does, too.\n\u201cThe main issue with BIP 9 is that it has a veto of only about 5 percent of hash power,\u201d Shaolinfry explained. \u201cThat veto could be intentionally or unintentionally triggered. Intentionally, like how miners are currently blocking SegWit activation. Or unintentionally due to upgrade apathy.\n\u201cMiner activation also draws attention to mining pool operators politically. The whole world is paying attention to who is and isn\u2019t signaling. That is undesirable. And what if the soft fork is for something that could make governments angry? We know this is the case in China for anonymity features, and increasingly in the United States as well.\u201d\nAs such, Shaolinfry proposed activating SegWit through a UASF.\nThe idea behind any UASF, in short, is that users simply activate the soft fork at an agreed-upon point in time. If these users represent a majority of the Bitcoin economy \u2014 exchanges, merchants, users \u2014 miners are financially incentivized to follow the new soft fork rules. If they don\u2019t, they could mine invalid blocks (according to the majority of the Bitcoin economy), and the \u201cbitcoins\u201d they earn would be worth less \u2014 or worth nothing at all.\nOnce a majority of hash power does follow these financial incentives and enforces the new rules, the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem should automatically follow, just like with any other soft fork.\nBIP 148\nThe first UASF proposal drafted by Shaolinfry is BIP 148.\nBIP 148 is an interesting take on a UASF because it is actually designed to trigger the existing BIP 9 SegWit-activation threshold.\n\u201cIf you want to redeploy SegWit, you must wait for the current deployment to expire by November of this year because many Bitcoin nodes won\u2019t accept it otherwise,\u201d Shaolinfry explained. \u201cBIP 148 is a way to make the current BIP 141 deployment activate before November. That\u2019s faster, and has the advantage that more than 70 percent of nodes has already upgraded.\u201d\nSpecifically, starting on August 1, BIP 148 nodes will reject any Bitcoin blocks that do not signal support for Segregated Witness via BIP 9. So, if the majority of the Bitcoin economy enforces BIP 148, miners will have to signal support for SegWit in order not to have their blocks rejected.\nOnce these miners do signal support for SegWit, this signaling would also trigger all the \u201cnormal\u201d SegWit nodes on the network. All these nodes would then enforce SegWit, even if they didn\u2019t participate in the BIP 148 activation themselves.\nAnd, from a game theory perspective, it may even be viable for a relatively small minority of the Bitcoin economy to get BIP 148 activated. Miners should have little to lose by signaling support for SegWit, but something to lose from not signaling: a smaller total number of users to sell their bitcoins to. As such, even a modest but committed BIP 148 user base could potentially be enough.\nFinally, echoing his Medium post on Litecoin\u2019s SegWit activation, Shaolinfry noted that even the possibility of such a UASF could be enough to make miners signal support \u2014 without even needing nodes to actually enforce it.\nBIP 148: Risks and Incentives\nThere are, however, some risks. These are why some prominent Bitcoin Core developers \u2014 like Blockstream CTO Gregory Maxwell and Chaincode Labs Co-Founder Suhas Daftuar \u2014 consider BIP 148 too disruptive.\nPer BIP 148, otherwise valid blocks would be rejected merely because they don\u2019t include a signal. The rejection of these blocks would waste miners\u2019 resources and detrimentally affect Bitcoin\u2019s security. \nMoreover, if only a minority of hash power enforces the new rules \u2014 either because they ignore financial incentives or because only a small minority of the economy enforces the new rules in the first place \u2014 the Bitcoin blockchain could split in two. There would be a \u201cSegWit chain\u201d and a \u201cnon-SegWit chain.\u201d That would open up a new can of worms, where the risks for users on both ends of the chain are not the same.\n\u201cThe incentives are clearly there for miners to follow the economy,\u201d said Shaolinfry in response to this criticism. \u201cBut indeed, there is a chain split risk if less than 51 percent [of] miners comply and run BIP 148. However, even in this circumstance, the non-BIP 148 chain is asymmetrically disadvantaged, and will almost certainly be completely wiped out. The SegWit chain will always be more valuable, and once a majority of miners switches to that chain, the non-SegWit chain will disappear altogether.\u201d\nFurthermore, from a certain threshold on, the risk of a chain split become smaller as it gathers more support. This is why another prominent Bitcoin Core developer, Luke Dashjr, is throwing his weight behind the proposal.\nAnd to avoid these kinds of risks, there could be another twist to BIP 148 as well, Shaolinfry pointed out:\n\u201cThe interesting thing about BIP 148 is that any majority of miners can trigger it \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have to be 95 percent. If 75 or even just 51 percent of hash power starts rejecting non-signaling blocks per August 1, they will always claim the longest chain. So really, all miners will from then on have to signal support and activate SegWit \u2014 or have all their blocks orphaned by the network.\u201d\nFinally, Shaolinfry may also release code \u2014 \u201cSegsignal\u201d \u2014 to allow miners to signal whether they will deploy BIP 148 and under what condition. Using this, miners could, for example, agree to activate SegWit through BIP 148 if, and only if, 51 percent indicates that they are willing to.\n\u201cThis should remove any risk of a chain-split, even a short-lived one,\u201d Shaolinfry said.\nBIP 149 (and BIP 8)\nShaolinfry\u2019s alternative UASF proposal is BIP 149.\nBIP 149 utilizes an entirely new soft fork activation mechanism: BIP 8. BIP 8 resembles BIP 9 in that it initially allows miners to activate the soft fork through hash power. However, as opposed to BIP 9, the soft fork proposal doesn\u2019t just time out by the end of the activation period. Instead, it sets an activation deadline. If that deadline is reached, nodes activate the soft fork regardless of hash power support.\nThere is a particular technical advantage of BIP 149 over BIP 148: it is less intrusive for miners. While BIP 148 effectively forces miners to signal, with BIP 149 miners don\u2019t actually have to do all that much. They can support SegWit if they want to. If not, they may want to run a so-called \u201cborder node\u201d to filter invalid transactions and blocks post-activation, but that\u2019s about it.\nShaolinfry plans to implement BIP 149 in dedicated Bitcoin software if BIP 148 doesn\u2019t succeed, and when the current BIP 9 SegWit proposal has expired by mid-November. The activation deadline for BIP 149 is then scheduled for early July 2018. \u00a0\nSome developers, like Maxwell, are in no rush to activate SegWit and consider BIP 149 preferable. But others, like Dashjr, believe it will take too long.\nShaolinfry himself noted: \n\u201cBIP 149 is not too slow from a technical point of view. But, I do think the longer SegWit isn\u2019t activated, the more gremlins and obstacles are going to besiege Bitcoin. So if the ecosystem rallies around BIP 148, that would bring this nightmare to a close.\u201d\n", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 23}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nQtum is an up-and-coming smart contract platform set to launch in September of this year. Sometimes ambitiously referring to itself as \u201cChina\u2019s Ethereum,\u201d the project recently raised $15 million in three days through a successful crowdsale or \u201cInitial Coin Offering\u201d (ICO).\nOn a technical level, the Qtum blockchain will resemble Bitcoin, but will integrate an Ethereum-like Virtual Machine on top for smart contracting purposes. Additionally, Qtum is in the process of implementing a \u201cDecentralized Governance Protocol\u201d (DGP). This DGP will have smart contracts determine the blockchain\u2019s parameter selection, like its block size limit.\nJordan Earls, also known as \u201cearlz\u201d online, is the co-founder and lead developer of Qtum.\n\u201cWe believe this will allow for Qtum to be the first self-modifiable, self-regulating and ultimately self-aware blockchain,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u00a0The Concept\nAny blockchain has a number of parameters. In Bitcoin, this of course includes the 1 megabyte block size limit. But it also includes the block reward (currently 12.5), the block interval time (ten minutes) and more. These and three other parameters apply to Qtum as well.\nBut there are two basic problems with needing to have these parameters. First, they are very hard to get \u201cright,\u201d in so far as that\u2019s even possible, since different parameters benefit different use cases. And second, in a decentralized system, these parameters can be very hard to change.\n\u201cThe core rationale and problem we had when designing this is that we will release Qtum with some initial parameters that we try to make perfect,\u201d Earls told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBut we don't know what the ecosystem will look like one month after release, much less one year. So, we designed DGP. That way, we can tune the blockchain to be as usable and secure as possible without needing to fork, just to change a simple number from 1 to 2.\u201d\nQtum plans to realize this way of \u201ctuning the blockchain\u201d by doing what it does best: The DGP will consist of relatively straightforward smart contracts made up of blockchain-readable pieces of executable code.\n\u201cWe have open-source smart contracts which implement the rules for changing the parameters, which will then be accepted by all nodes. It implements a fairly simple governance system of \u2018user keys\u2019 and \u2018admin keys.\u2019 There is a modifiable parameter in the contract which determines how many keys of each type must vote in order to approve a change to, say, the block size limit.\u201d\nImportantly, through the use of smart contracts, these keys can actually represent more than just a regular user per key: Each key can represent a defined group.\n\u201cPerhaps one key represents a majority of hash power; or a key represents coin votes by coin holders; or a key acts according to a dynamic limit based on how full blocks are. Or even oracles: a key can effectively be controlled by people or servers that act based on input not directly readable by the blockchain itself, like USD market price for transaction fees. It\u2019s extremely flexible.\u201d\nQtum will almost certainly include smart contracts for the block size limit, the gas schedule to determine the price of different smart contract operations (for which Ethereum hard forked several times) and the minimum gas price. Additionally, it might deploy smart contracts for block interval times, block rewards, maximum gas per block and maximum script size or signature operations per transaction or block. \nChanging the Rules\nEmbedding the parameter selection in smart contracts is clever and having all node software adjust accordingly even more so. However, an arguably even harder problem is not so much what parameter is decided on, but who gets to decide in the first place and how.\nIn Qtum, the initial parameters will be set by the developers based on their testing and measurements.\n\u201cFor instance, we've already determined that a block size of 2 megabytes should be reasonable,\u201d Earls said.\nAfter that, the initial set of rules to define the parameters can be changed themselves within the rules of the system, too.\nA smart contract could, for example, start out relatively simple: It requires a majority of core developers to change the rules of the contract. Then, if a majority of core developers decides that instead of just developers, it should also include a majority of coin holders, the contract can be changed to a two-of-two multisig contract. From that moment on, one key would represent the developers, while the other key would represent the majority of coin holders. Next, if both developers and coin holders agree, hash power can have a seat at the table, too, and so forth.\nAs such, Qtum smart contracts can change not only the parameters of the system, but also how the parameters themselves can be changed.\nThat said, as Earls acknowledged, the Decentralized Governance Protocol can\u2019t actually solve all governance problems. It\u2019s specifically designed to make certain predefined parameters more easily adjustable, and it can indeed even change how these parameters can be adjusted to some extent.\nBut the Decentralized Governance Protocol does not and cannot apply to network rules that aren\u2019t among these predefined parameters. Protocol changes outside of these specific parameters would still require a typical upgrade mechanism, like a hard fork or a soft fork.\n\u201cI believe if Bitcoin had DGP technology, then we would still see all this fighting about SegWit vs Bitcoin Unlimited, etcetera,\u201d Earls acknowledged. \u201cBut, DGP would have been used in the meantime to increase the block size to something conservative but reasonable like 2 megabytes or 4 megabytes, to avoid all the transaction speed problems. Meanwhile, the developers and community could figure out a more permanent solution.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 24}

Unfortunately, ticket touts (scalpers) and secondary websites are taking advantage and extorting the event ticketing industry. With big names such as Mumford and Sons, Coldplay, Adele and Ed Sheeran speaking out about this problem, the issue remains. The U.K. government has introduced legislation that aims to prevent the use of bots from purchasing tickets to resell them at inflated prices. Still, more than 21,000 people in the U.K. have reported falling victim to ticket fraud in the last three years with the majority of these reports concerning secondary ticket markets, according to research. \u00a0\nIn order to solve the issues around fraudulent tickets and the high prices associated with them Edinburgh-based Citizen Ticket, the ethical 'David meets Goliath' event ticketing platform backed by blockchain technology, was created by CFO Harry Boisseau and COO Philip Shaw-Stewart. During their time working in the events industry for the past 10 years, the pair has worked on everything from large-scale music events and pop-up food events to underground concerts and charity fundraisers. \u00a0\nThe Problem\nIn partnership with Get Online Safe and the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers (STAR), the City of London Police's National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) found that over the last three years more than \u00a317 million ($22 million) has been lost to ticket fraudsters. \u00a0\nIn April, the three organizations undertook a series of Facebook flash sales, which saw over 1,500 people attempting to buy music tickets from a fake ticket website called 'Surfed Arts.' Purporting to be a secondary ticket website, the adverts were aimed at certain locations where concerts were taking place over the summer but had sold out. The research found that women over the age of 65 and those who reside in London tried to purchase the most fake tickets; however, men and women aged 35-44 and those living in Birmingham were the least likely to click on the fake advert. \nThose who did click on the Surfed Arts website were told they could not buy the sold out tickets before being informed on how they could better protect themselves from becoming a potential victim to ticket fraudsters. According to the NFIB, the idea was to get people to change their online behavior and to consider whether secondary ticket sales are legitimate. \nSocial media is also becoming another avenue for ticket fraudsters to advertise ticket sales. Data from Action Fraud found that in 2015 there was a 55 percent rise in ticket fraud with major sporting events such as the Rugby World Cup and the Premier League football accounting for a quarter of all incidents of ticket scams. Fraudulent tickets for gigs and festivals represented 15 percent, costing the U.K. public \u00a35.2 million ($6.75 million). \nThose who do purchase fake tickets can find that the nature of them can vary. They either don't materialize, never existed or charge hyper-inflated prices through secondary ticket websites than what's listed on a primary ticket website. \nA Blockchain Solution\nWith the help from fellow team member Colin Palmer, CTO, Boisseau and Shaw-Stewart brought to fruition the recent launch of BitTicket, the first digital event tickets on the blockchain for public events, using the cryptocurrency Ethereum Classic. The idea was dreamt up while searching online for Ed Sheeran tickets on a secondary ticket website with high costs. \nThe team found that not only were there large quantities of tickets being hoarded by secondary ticket websites with increased prices attached to them, but that primary ticket websites were sending them, in bulk, to the secondary ticket websites before they went on sale. However, that wasn't the only problem the team found. \n\"The event ticketing monopolies own primary ticket websites and secondary ticket trading websites,\" said Shaw-Stewart, speaking to Bitcoin Magazine. \"The secondary ticket website allows the monopolies to collect event tickets from their primary ticket website, then charge highly inflated prices for the tickets on their secondary website under the pretense of being a platform created to allow fans to resell tickets.\" \nAs an example, they cited a Robbie Williams concert that was held at the O2 Arena in London. On a primary website, the tickets were being sold for \u00a340 ($52). However, according to Shaw-Stewart, the primary site proceeded to sell 80 percent of their tickets to the umbrella company's secondary sister site. There, the same tickets were being sold for \u00a3300 ($390) each. \n\"There is a problem in the industry we believe to be unethical, the resale of event tickets by secondary ticket websites, often at highly inflated prices.\" \u00a0\nWith the use of the blockchain, BitTicket is aiming to provide a secure and transparent system which is resistant to fraud and counterfeiting. With every ticket sale publicly verifiable on the blockchain, it locks and guarantees the value of the ticket in a way that is unmatched by private databases and paper systems, says Shaw-Stewart. \n\nIt also has inbuilt anti-fraud sales rules to ensure that no secondary ticket website can hoard tickets to control the supply that allows them to charge inflated prices. If the resale rules are broken by secondary ticket websites or ticket touts (scalpers), the fraudulent accounts are frozen and the tickets are made invalid. \nStill in the early stages of launching Citizen Ticket, the team is planning on rolling out a large-scale marketing campaign in the coming months to target event organizers and event goers. \nThe first ever event to use this new blockchain application was the Scottish Street Food Awards in Edinburgh, which took place on May 12. Utilizing the BitTicket platform, the event proved to be a success for the Citizen Ticket team, who said that the platform had performed exactly as they had expected. \n\"From a customer's point of view very little changed; they purchased and presented their ticket like any other digital ticket,\" said Shaw-Stewart. \"They were asked for ID at the door to confirm ownership of their ticket and that's it, they were in.\" \u00a0\nIn keeping with the company\u2019s commitment to ethical practices, Citizen Ticket also works with two charitable partners: the Movember Foundation and SkatePal. Through ticket sales made on the platform, donations are made to these two charities.\nWith an array of events already listed on the platform, as well as its fundraising initiatives, the team is hoping to level the playing field for the industry with BitTickets. \n\"We hope that the launch of BitTicket will usher in a new era of ethical event tickets where both fan and artist are protected from the unethical practices of ticket touts and secondary ticket websites,\" concluded Shaw-Stewart.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 24}

Not only that, but a majority of messaging apps users are young, which is an extremely important demographic for messaging apps. \nKik believes that through its token it can bring together the areas of communications, information and commerce in a new way that will fuel how today's generation and future ones will connect. Founded in 2009, Kik was the first chat app that went viral in 2010 from zero to one million users in 15 days. Since then the company has continued to meet the innovation space by becoming the first chat app to become a platform in 2011 before establishing itself as the first app within the Western world to add bots in 2014. Now, Kik is the first chat app to add its own digital currency. \nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Ted Livingston, Kik's CEO said that the main motivation for launching their Kin token, which comes from the word \u201ckinship,\u201d came down to two main insights: digital services, which are becoming more important to our daily lives, and the fact that these services are being owned and controlled by fewer and fewer companies. This, in turn, is bringing about less innovation and choice. According to Livingston, this centralization is the result of both economics and competition. \n\"From an economic side, it's very hard for independent developers, including companies as big as Kik, to monetize,\" he said. \"There are a few companies that have huge scale that use that scale to monetize their advertising.\" \nLivingston adds that, when these bigger companies monetize their advertising, they then give everything else away for free. This means that for independent digital services who don't bring in enough money through advertising, they live in a world where these giants have set the expectations where everything should be free. \n\"As a result, it's very hard for all these digital services to monetize,\" Livingston adds. \"Those that do, these giants then turn to a copy-and-crush strategy where they take all the ideas from the players, copy it and use their much larger resources to crush the other competitors who do make it.\" \nAs a result, Livingston states that now is the right time to put forward an alternative ecosystem of digital services that isn't just open, but through digital currencies and decentralization, better. By launching their Kin token, Kik is attempting to set up a new economic system that can monetize digital services and deliver a new way to compete together with the larger companies. \nThe Kin Token and the Kin Foundation\nThrough the advanced developments in digital currencies and the blockchain, Kik is planning on creating a decentralized ecosystem of digital services through four steps: creating the Kin token on Ethereum, integrating Kin into Kik, developing the Kin Rewards Engine and launching the Kin Foundation. \nImplemented on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC20 token, Kin will serve as the basis of interoperability for all transactions within the Kin ecosystem. By adopting the token within the Kik app, it's hoped that millions of users will facilitate widespread adoption of Kin, establishing demand and value for the cryptocurrency. In preparation for the eventual launch of Kin, Kik has been experimenting with the integration of a cryptocurrency on its platform since 2014. \n\"In 2014, we launched an experiment called Kik Coins and the question we were trying to answer was: Could we get millions of everyday consumers earning and spending natively in a digital currency?\" Livingston said. \"The result is that we created a transaction volume that was three times better than Bitcoin's global transaction volume at the time.\" \nKik also realized that the best way for consumers to understand cryptocurrency was for them to earn it through digital services like Kik. \n\"The biggest flaw with all the other cryptocurrencies is that nobody gets their paycheck in that cryptocurrency; the only way to get it is to buy it, for 99.99 percent of people,\" he added. \"This is where teenagers are another big asset for Kik in that they don't have a ton of spending power and this is a way to earn that spending power by offering value inside the community itself.\" \nOver time, Livingston explained, there will be various ways that users can earn Kin. One of the examples he gives is through exclusive group chats by charging an entrance fee with Kin to then spend within the Kik ecosystem. \nKin Distribution\nKik is planning on starting a crowdsale where the amount of Kin tokens available will be $1 trillion. However, the majority of the Kin will be set aside to form the Kin Rewards Engine. Modelled similarly to the Bitcoin mining system, the Kin Rewards Engine will release a certain amount of Kin every so often to all the developers that build digital services within the ecosystem. \n\"Every day there will be a daily reward, which we think will start roughly at $100,000 per day,\" he said. \"As an owner of a service, if you integrate Kin and get people transacting Kin inside your digital service, which generates 10 percent of all transactions within the ecosystem, that would entitle you to 10 percent of this daily reward.\" \nUltimately, the more services that join the Kin ecosystem computes to more transactions that happen each day, which increases Kin's value on public exchanges and, in turn, boosts the daily reward. \n\"It creates this amazing network effect where all these digital services work together to grow the overall value of the ecosystem,\" Livingston adds. \"They all get a fair and equitable piece of that economic value they create, and consumers get this ecosystem of services that continues to grow in both size and quality.\" \nAccording to Livingston, one of the most underappreciated values of digital currencies is how much economic opportunity they can produce. For instance, he said even though they are giving away $100,000 per day, the amount of Kin available won't run out anytime soon. \n\"If Ethereum was giving out $100,000 of Ether a day at its current $10 billion market cap, it would take them 273 years to give away all the Ether,\" he said. \"If Bitcoin was doing it at their $30 billion market cap, they could give away $300,000 a day for 273 years, and these are both cryptocurrencies not used by mainstream consumers.\" \nAs such Livingston believes that the Kin reward could easily go to $200,000, $500,000, even $1 million a day, incentivizing the creation of an open and compelling ecosystem of digital services for consumers. \nThrough the Kin Foundation, the team are ultimately trying to achieve a decentralized system where the developer doesn't need to trust the Kin Foundation. As a nonprofit, the foundation will oversee the open and fair growth of the system where it will provide three things: it will administer the rewards system, it will offer an identity service for users to move between the digital services and it will provide a transaction service for users to earn and spend Kin in a secure and frictionless way, Livingston states. \u00a0\nKik is due to release their whitepaper today, at which point they expect to start working with the crypto community, which will lead to their crowdsale in the next few months.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 25}

He is currently an Operations Associate at BTC Media where is turning his passion for cryptocurrency from a hobby into a career.\nPurse\u00a0has announced a new agreement with Bitmain Technologies, F2Pool, Bitcoin.com and Bixin that will allocate millions of dollars to its bcoin protocol development.\nWhen working with Bitcoin, decentralization is king. Purse CEO Andrew Lee, through bcoin, extends that logic to the Bitcoin protocol itself. \n\u201cFor Bitcoin to take off, we need multiple implementations with even market share,\u201d Lee explains in a Medium post. \u201cDecentralizing protocol development will lead to multiple clients, diverse communities, more developers, better security and more innovation.\u201d\nSo what is bcoin? Put simply, Bitcoin was written in C++ coding language, which has a steep learning curve and remains a bit out of reach for many developers. Bcoin helps to solve that problem by re-implementing Bitcoin in Javascript, arguably a more widely used language. This opens the door for more innovation in Bitcoin because more developers will be able to create apps and protocol improvements in Javascript instead of the more complex C++. In October of 2016, Purse announced that it would be running its online market service on top of bcoin.\nAn important feature of this new agreement is that the participants will gain no equity in any of the projects that arise from the funding. \u201cBitmain, Bitcoin.com, Bixin and F2Pool donated funds for a non-equity stake to specifically help with supporting the development of multiple implementations. Similar companies also donated to Parity (who is working on a Rust implementation of Bitcoin). The more client diversity Bitcoin has, the better,\u201d explained Steven McKie, head of Growth & Product Content at Purse, in correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBcoin remains an independent project.\u201d\nAs for how the funding will be allocated, McKie explains, \u201cThe funding will help directly with onboarding and training new developers to commit to the bcoin full-node implementation, open-source project.\u201d\nThe timing of this announcement is important as it comes almost immediately after the announcement of the 2MBHF + SegWitSF agreement. According to McKie, \u201cBcoin will work to implement support for the 2MBHF + SegWitSF proposal into the codebase as we stated in our support for the proposal.\u201d This funding agreement will go a long way toward helping that initiative.\n\u201cBcoin is built for modularity and for developers to quickly be able to start utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s robust global network and start hacking together useful tools and applications. Our full node is built on a stack that is attractive to as many developers as possible (node.js). Bcoin has support for all of Bitcoin\u2019s latest features; it\u2019s secure and production-tested by companies like Purse, BitPay, Bixin, Ripio and Bitwala \u2014 with more to come.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 25}

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nBitcoin has now shown about eight weeks of consecutive buying, leading into new all-time highs (ATHs) for the past three weeks. Trying to stay objective with mild to extreme euphoria in times like this can be difficult. As someone who was a new trader during the 2013 bubble, the chart is beginning to look very similar.\nMarket capitalization and trading volume both on exchanges and over-the-counter markets have hit ATHs as well. \n\n\n\nDespite being in price discovery mode, there is an established, longstanding trend we can compare the current price against, as well as the entire left side of the chart. Past results don\u2019t always predict the future, but they can influence it. \nThere are a few questions we can investigate:\nIs the price near an interim top?Is the price nearing parabolic conditions?Will the price continue on the previous trend at the same rate?\nLooking at the monthly Bitstamp chart, there have not been too many candles of this proportion. This would suggest we are nearing bubble-like conditions.\n\nPrice has also begun to close outside of the longstanding trend. This weekly candle has not closed yet, but if it does close outside of the diagonal, it will be the first weekly candle to do so. This again points to breaking the trend strongly to the upside.\n\nFibonacci retracement and extensions are admittedly partly magic voodoo, but there are plenty of traders who use and watch them to make the resistance and support levels legitimate. Drawing this Fibonacci from the local high established on March 10, 2017, to the low on January 14, 2015, several Fibonacci extensions emerge as well. \n\nThese can be seen as resistance levels, the next being the 1.618 at $2,088. Although the horizontal levels are arbitrary, we can confidently predict resistance based on the fit of the previous horizontals. Most of the prior \u201cFibs\u201d match the price. This should be seen less as curve fitting and more as levels that just make sense. Based on the Fibonacci levels alone, there is not necessarily evidence for top or bubble just yet. \nWe can tease apart the trend even further by using the Fibonacci tool on each previous high and low. \n\nIn the trend, a consolidation from the previous high to low has yielded a price that has seen resistance at the 2.272 Fibonacci extension. Currently, the price has exceeded the previous 2.272 Fibonacci extension and shown it was supported based on the multiple candle touches. This suggests price is moving faster than the previous trend as well as closer to bubble-like conditions.\nFor low-timeframe, intra-day trading, there was a long entry signal when the price cleanly broke the consolidation triangle. On the next correction, pullback or consolidation event, I\u2019d expect the support diagonal (green) to remain the same.\n\nRemember that splashy gold parity headline? BTC is now sitting several hundred dollars above it.\n\nSummary\nBitcoin is making ATHs by almost every available metric: price, market capitalization, volume, hashrate, difficulty and fee per transaction.Although $2,000 is the next milestone and resistance target, the price will likely exceed that level based on the strength and rate at which the price is exceeding current trends.Watch for signs of a large pullback or correction in the near future, two to three months at the latest, based on previous price history.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The Netki Digital ID will be both KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) verified, allowing users to access a variety of blockchain businesses including financial institutions like banks, exchanges and healthcare services.\nNetki wants their ID to work on any blockchain, public or private, around the world and to provide automated onboarding and validation of new customers, as well as easy sharing of digital identities.\nThe company\u2019s goal is to create a digital identity certificate that uses a standard recognized by governments everywhere as legally validated, to process transactions anywhere in the world. Pricing will be based on the number of certificates and the complexity of validations.\nThe Digital ID uses a new peer-to-peer payment protocol (BIP 75) that allows senders, receivers and their financial partners to exchange all four identities via a private encrypted channel.\t\nAccording to Netki\u2019s announcement, the Netki Digital ID service will allow for the easy capture of an individual\u2019s documents and biometrics via their smartphone, along with multiple levels of automated and manual verification, including database checks, machine learning and biometric analysis.\nInternational Compliance: A \u201cHerculean Task\u201d\nNetki IDs are already in use in the U.S. and Europe on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, and the company is hoping to expand its service both to new jurisdictions around the world and on new blockchain networks.\nNetki\u2019s CEO and Co-Founder Justin Newton talked to Bitcoin Magazine about the process of expanding its ID service, despite the challenge of many different legal requirements in an international regulatory environment.\nThe regulatory landscape is changing around the world at a rapid pace. With this in mind we designed our tools and protocols to be flexible in the case of differing, new or expanding regulatory requirements.\n\u201cAs we work on each new use case, we work with the customer\u2019s risk and compliance team to determine what requirements are appropriate for their needs.\u201d\nNewton told us their team spends time in each new jurisdiction consulting with local regulators before offering their service.\nAmber D. Scott, whose company\u00a0Outlier Solutions \u00a0works with blockchain startups on compliance and security issues, admires the spirit and sheer scope of Netki\u2019s undertaking but recognizes that it is a herculean task to have any ID be compliant in every jurisdiction. \nShe recommends that companies planning to implement any new identification solutions should thoroughly research the requirements of the jurisdictions they are operating in, to ensure \u201cthat a solution meets those requirements in their entirety.\u201d\nScott added, \u201cWe spend a lot of time with our clients conducting this type of testing, and very few solutions pass the tests.\u201d\nMichael Perklin, an internationally recognized security expert who oversees security for\u00a0ShapeShift, acknowledges that verifying users can be time-consuming and expensive, and agrees that something like a universal ID would make this process easier.\n\u201cMany people complain that there are 20+ different identity standards and it seems that Netki is proposing a 21st. It seems like a great idea in theory but its success would depend on the community adopting the Netki ID as the industry standard as opposed to another service like uPort.\u201d\nUPort offers a mobile app that allows users to create self-sovereign credentials that would allow them to process transactions on blockchains.\nNewton told us that while uPort is focusing on a business model, Netki has open-sourced their protocol. Another important difference between the two companies is that uPort stores private information on the blockchain while Netki stores information off-chain. That being said, Netki is currently partnering with uPort on several projects.\nCaribbean Service Bitt Is the Test Case\nNetki chose the Caribbean region to test its new service, partnering with fintech company Bitt, which provides a mobile wallet and payment services to anywhere in the world.\nNewton told us:\n\u201cIn terms of the project that we are working on with Bitt, we believe that one of the greatest promises of blockchain [technology] is around financial inclusion. The Caribbean region has far greater mobile phone penetration than banking penetration, and most banking is effectively controlled overseas,\u201d he said.\nBy creating a locally run and focused alternative, they can lower the cost of remittance, spur inter-island trade and service many people currently excluded from banking and online finance.\nEmpowering Individuals Over Institutions\nNetki\u2019s founders believe that blockchain technology is the game-changer that will take society to the next level, allowing more democratization and levelling of existing silos.\nNewton believes that blockchain technology is a means of empowering individuals and changing the way society interacts with each other; however, without easy access for the majority of people, universal adoption will remain a dream.\nAs part of simplifying and making blockchain technology more user friendly, Netki already offers a wallet-naming service for $9.99 per year, which allows users to register their unwieldy wallet address of letters and numbers to a simple name, making for easier transactions for both users and businesses.\nNewton is excited about the future possibilities of blockchain technology for decentralization and democratization, saying:\n\u201cFor the first time, using the standards we implemented at Bitt, and more broadly with BIP 75, regulated entities such as banks can operate on public networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum while still meeting their risk and compliance requirements. \u00a0With the recent institutional interest, and positive government movement around digital currency, these tools couldn\u2019t come at a better time to enable the ecosystem to really step up to the next level in terms of both usage and opportunity.\u201d\nNetki is partnering with IBM in the Hyperledger Project and with PwC Australia in its Vulcan Project.\nInvestors in Netki include O'Reilly, AlphaTech Ventures, Colle Capital, Digital Currency Group, Plug and Play, the Husseine Group, Bitfinex and Base Ventures.\n", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 22}

A vocal advocate for Bitcoin and the blockchain movement in the media and at industry events, he has been a leading pioneer in the effort to integrate bitcoin payments at Gyft during his tenure there.\n\u00a0As CEO of Civic, a new startup company focused on digital identity, Lingham is now in pursuit of a new entrepreneurial quest. Civic\u2019s mission is to deliver secure, low-cost identity verification that\u2019s decentralized via blockchain technology. Consumers will have the ability to share information such as their social security or identity numbers securely from any device with digital signatures that validate that the information hasn\u2019t been tampered with.\nOn May 23, Lingham and Civic CTO Jonathan Smith formally announced their launch of services at Consensus 2017, offering a viable solution to ID theft, fake online profiles and bank accounts, and other data breaches that have an adverse impact on consumer identity. Civic also unveiled their plans at the Token Summit for a token offering on the Ethereum platform. A final token will be issued on the RSK platform. \nCivic tokens will provide access to the product while allowing token holders to benefit from its network effect. Overall, Civic endeavors to raise $33 million through the token sale, with additional tokens beyond that allocated to enterprise partners and developers. The company has already received $2.75 million in funding via Social Leverage, an early-stage seed investment fund, as well as through various VC firms that are engaged in Bitcoin and blockchain technology, including Pantera Capital, Blockchain Capital and Digital Currency Group. \nCivic\u2019s stealth digital identity platform is designed to replace passwords, usernames and the need for biometrics. The company\u2019s main value proposition targets the explosion of data breaches that hit both consumers and the businesses they engage with. Civic will deliver applications for securing cryptocurrencies, e-signatures, social accounts, financial services, e-commerce/credit cards and medical records. Moreover, it will have the capacity to be used as a digital replacement for passports, driver\u2019s licenses and voter ID, among other utilities. \nConsumers will install an app on their smart device, and when someone attempts to access their SSNs within their personal ecosystems, they get notified. This serves as a preventive measure for the unauthorized use of personal information. Ultimately the goal is to deliver solutions for consumers to better control their personal information while providing a positive customer service experience. \nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Lingham noted that ID theft is a pervasive issue, especially with the recent spate of around 2,000 data breaches per year in the U.S. alone. \nCivic wants to solve this problem by granting people control of their identity and where their personal information is stored. By verifying their information and storing it on their personal devices, consumers can ensure that their identity information is only distributed to authorized parties.\u00a0\nHe emphasized that when a consumer or business uses the Civic login service, no usernames or passwords are created, thereby reducing the vulnerabilities associated around one hack being able to to access other accounts.\nLingham believes that blockchains are likely the most secure place to store information right now, which is why Civic is constantly assessing opportunities to leverage and capitalize on the emerging technology. \nRegarding the often-knotty scenarios created around securing government acceptance and collaboration, Lingham said: \u201cWe believe that the technology we have is unique and highly differentiated. That said, as we continue to build our user base and network for acceptance, this will draw in governments. We have already had some interest in this area and believe it will only be a matter of time.\u201d \nBased in Palo Alto, California, Lingham says he plans to open an office in his native South Africa with the goal of hiring developers there. He decided to take this ambitious step following reforms to South Africa\u2019s business regulations that have created a more favorable environment for investments.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always believed that one of the best applications for cryptocurrencies was the ability to power something like voting, one day,\u201d said Lingham. \u201cIn order to get there, the larger distributed mobile identity problem needed to be solved first. This is what we are focusing on now \u2014 to build the world\u2019s largest identity platform, powered by technology that decentralizes and secures consumer identity information.\u201d\nImage of Vinny Lingham: By Sidearmslide - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0,\u00a0https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9856443\n", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 26}

As such, it was the first country in the world that completely prohibited use of \u201cany kind of currency that is not issued and controlled by a government or an authorized entity.\u201d\nThis ban forms the basis for this week\u2019s arrests. While there are currently few specifics available, news reports suggest the Bolivians were distributing brochures promoting bitcoin, and possibly selling bitcoin online.\u00a0\n\"We have confiscated brochures relating to business schemes that go around giving trainings and making business plans in relation to virtual currencies that are operating abroad,\u201d Valdivia Bautista stated. \u201cThe Bolivian population should not participate in closed [cryptocurrency] groups through WhatsApp. The only thing they are doing is taking advantage of the population, deceiving the people to appropriate their money.\u201d\nSpeaking to CoinTelegraph half a year ago, the creator of the Bolivian Bitcoin Facebook group explained that Bolivian Bitcoin users maintain connections through social media. Because cryptocurrencies are banned in the Latin American country, trades are organised through small-scale discussion groups, and the exchange of bitcoins often happens in person.\nApparently, the Bolivian authorities have taken note. According to hoybolivia.com, the ASFI said that it will continue to track down and arrest anyone that promotes or sells cryptocurrency on social media or other websites. Bolivians are also asked to \u201ctake care of their savings by reporting [cryptocurrency related] activities\u201d by calling a special hotline or contacting the country\u2019s \u201cSpecial Forces Against Felony.\u201d\n\"It is important to urge the population to report these cases in which people aim to take advantage of people and their families' savings,\" said Valdivia Bautista.\nBolivia is not the first Latin American country that is cracking down on Bitcoin users.

This complements a global blockchain technology market that\u2019s expected to grow from $210.2 million in 2016 to $2.3 billion by 2021 according to Market Reports Hub. \nThe collision between the IoT and blockchain worlds portends some important payments industry developments around the efficient tracking of device payment history, all supported by a ledger of secure data exchanges among devices, web systems and users. Further, this technological convergence also shows promise in terms of the use of smart devices that are programmed to conduct a variety of transactions such as the automatic issuance of invoices and payments. \u00a0\nDan Loomis, vice president and director of mobile product management at the business and financial software firm Intuit, is firmly entrenched in this evolving IoT/blockchain conversation through his work in creating payment experiences for businesses that operate on a global scale, and brought this expertise to the TRANSACT panel discussion.\nIn an exclusive interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Loomis remarked that for the small, emerging business clients he works with, cash is king. \u201cFor our team at Intuit, it all comes down to how we can help these businesses create immediate operating capital. The ability to quickly onboard clients into a payment service and to get paid quickly is really important. Their mantra is often \u2018Pay me, pay me faster, and how can we as a business accept all methods of payment?\u2019\u201d\nLoomis says that at his company and for the payments space in general, the thought of leveraging the blockchain\u2019s immutable, permanent, auditable features is fascinating on a variety of levels. He notes that specific to Intuit, there is a lot of investigation going on into blockchain technology and how it may be applied to their payment models. \n\u201cWe facilitate a lot of invoice, payable and receivable experiences for our clients. Aspirationally, being able to track these logistics in a manner that\u2019s clear and transparent via blockchain [technology] would be very appealing.

Having launched its new Factom Harmony solution in March, the company hopes to attract big banks and host their sensitive mortgage data. By increasing the efficiency of document management, Harmony will allow a seamless transaction process between lenders and brokers, without them having to worry about lost documents, altered agreements or incomplete records.\nBuilt on the Factom Apollo data management solution, which allows users to store and create immutable digital records, Harmony \u201cworks with existing imaging or document management solutions to create secure, transparent, unalterable records for final loan documents.\u201d In the process, every file is secured within a blockchain container, locking in the order of the final documentation, recording each person who accesses files and rejecting duplicate documents. \nFactom refers to this system as \u201ca perfected digital audit vault\u201d for each specific loan. Thus the core product behind Factom Harmony is called Digital Vault, which locks into time the most important closing documents and gives a complete history of every file from origination to close. \nAs an all-inclusive solution, Factom Harmony\ncreates a permanent record and index of final loan documents, making audits smooth by reducing quality control, due diligence and review time; reduces costs by creating a single source that organizes the final documentation and provides cryptographic truth that each document is an authentic copy; provides access control to multiple parties that can collaborate under audit conditions and exceptions, and includes an immutable audit trail of all actions on each document in real-time, giving a true history of every loan;opens a secure audit room or due diligence deal room that can be tracked on the Factom blockchain. \nAccording to Peter Kirby, CEO of Factom Inc., \u201cThe Harmony solution and the underlying Factom blockchain provide lenders with something that was fundamentally missing from the industry. With Harmony, a lender is able to create a final set of documents for each closed loan.\u201d\nRight now, origination of a loan has underlying costs of about $7,500 per loan \u2014 up from approximately $2,500 per loan in 2006. The costs have tripled over the last few years as banks have been forced to step up their efforts to be in compliance with new laws. \nFactom Harmony addresses many of the redundancy issues associated with these efforts by permanently documenting the process from the moment documents are first created, and then allowing that data to be quickly shared and verified digitally. Having digital records that can be securely shared and verified also speeds up financial institutions\u2019 ability to settle transaction among themselves. Factom does not claim to move money faster, but it does attempt to allow others to have the confidence in the data they are reviewing and thus speed up the processes. \nAccording to Factom, Harmony is the first practical and effective deployment of blockchain technology in the mortgage industry. Through combining blockchain technology, advanced cryptography tools and a digital fingerprint for each document or data file, lenders can securely store and expose individual loan files or documents to various third parties.\n\u201cThis technology dramatically changes the approach and reduces the costs for audits, third-party reviews, litigation costs and due diligence costs,\u201d Jason Nadeau, executive vice president of Factom, said in a statement. \u201cThe combination of blockchain and digital signature technology within Factom\u2019s solution creates a solution where the benefits of digital signatures and electronic vaulting are now available for all documents without having to deploy any eMortgage or eClosing technology.\u201d\nToni Moss is the founder and CEO of AmeriCatalyst LLC, an advisory firm located in Austin, Texas, specializing in corporate strategy, business development, market intelligence and market positioning for companies engaged in all sectors of the residential real-estate and housing finance industry in the North American market. Moss has advised clients including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, the European Commission and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Well-known in the U.S. mortgage industry, she is a big fan of Factom Harmony, and had this to say about the blockchain-based solution: \n\u201cThe industry remains disparate and fractured with regard to the acquisition, management, distribution and protection of data, with a wide variety of third-party providers, proprietary platforms and programming languages. It\u2019s just a matter of time before mortgage data is aggregated into a secure and centralized industry utility \u2014 and blockchain [technology] is the most promising catalyst to enable it,\u201d Moss said to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cAs data becomes more plentiful, accurate, accessible and immutable, investors will have the confidence to return to the mortgage market; processing, servicing and transactional costs (should) decrease; and the market itself will be far more secure and sustainable in the long-term.\u201d\nFactom has yet to announce any contracts or partnerships related to its mortgage solution, but the time is right for big banks to start utilizing blockchain technology. In a separate recent development for the company, the Factom blockchain was made accessible to Chinese developers through WanCloud, a product released by Wanxiang Blockchain Corporation to drive progress among Chinese enterprises.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 26}
{"title": "SALT Enables Traditional Lending Secured by Cryptocurrency", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/salt-enables-traditional-lending-secured-cryptocurrency/", "birthday": "May 25, 2017  4:16 PM EST", "date": "2017-05-25 21:16:00", "content": "A new startup in Denver, Colorado has set out to take on the blockchain-based lending market.\u00a0Secured Automated Lending Technology, or SALT for short, is a membership-based financial enterprise with its eyes set on being recognized as the first lending platform to facilitate loans collateralized by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nTouted as \u201ctraditional lending secured by cryptocurrency,\u201d SALT will allow members to leverage assets like bitcoin and ether for loan collateral. This new platform, which will be tethered to Ethereum ERC20 smart contracts, will enable borrowers to tap into \u201ccapital on demand\u201d via its ecosystem of lenders. The major value proposition is that it provides a mechanism for supporting the value of investor holdings, while simplifying all aspects of the loan process and leveraging the power of a blockchain-centric lending market. \nThe following scenario illustrates a typical use case for SALT: imagine if you sold out your entire bitcoin holdings in 2016 for a luxury purchase, only to see the price shoot to the moon in 2017, resulting in a loss of all that you might have gained over the course of that period had you held on to your bitcoins.\nWith SALT, an investor who has collateral they wish to retain can leverage their crypto-assets for a loan. This allows them to maintain a long position with their assets while creating a greater set of options with their taxes. \nThe SALT loan process consists of four primary steps: \nLoan Creation: a borrower sets up a membership account and then forwards their collateral to the SALT Oracle Wallet. This is a multi-signature blockchain wallet that functions as a repository for collateral while automatically managing the lending terms.The loan funds, once approved, are transferred to the borrower\u2019s bank account.Loan Repayment: a borrower makes timely, periodic payments to the lender.Loan Completion: upon repayment of the loan, the borrower will have their collateral returned.\nSALT doesn\u2019t perform credit checks on borrowers but does conduct full Anti-money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) verification checks. Loans made via the platform are denominated in and repaid with traditional currencies.\nCryptocurrency assets are used only by the recipient as collateral for the loans. Borrowers can choose to pay off their loans early without being subjected to a prepayment penalty.\nSALT members are not required to possess blockchain assets in order to lend on the platform. Lenders must be accredited investors in accordance with federal regulations and guidelines established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. They must also pass SALT\u2019s Lending Suitability Test.\nAt the time of the company\u2019s soft launch, Shawn Owen, CEO of SALT, told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cCurrently, if you are a holder of blockchain assets, a large chunk of your financial wealth is not being recognized by lenders. With SALT, we see a future where virtually all of the world\u2019s value is on blockchains, with lending reflective of our globally connected, digitized lives.\u201d\nOwen says he left his full-time job in 2016, intrigued by the idea of a lending platform that could leverage billions of dollars of untapped cryptocurrencies. \u201cI saw this trend where the vast majority of Bitcoiners just wanted to hold on to their assets. With this realization, the light bulbs all went off, which prompted me to go full blast with SALT. I haven\u2019t really looked back since.\u201d \u00a0\nWhen asked about how he came up with name SALT, Owen has this to say: \u201cWe liked the name because \u2018salt\u2019 was historically the first well-known commodity-based money. Our version of SALT is a way to articulate what we do: taking blockchain technology and smart contracts and building lending terms and everything revolving around credit products and putting them into smart contracts in a more automatic and secure way.\u201d\nOwen says many in the Bitcoin community have at one point or another experienced a situation where they have sold because they felt that they had a good gain, only to look back and realize that they had missed a massive opportunity. And in that sale, notes Owen, they most likely had to worry about capital gains tax counting and were now wishing they could go back in time six months and have all that ether or bitcoin back. \nIn terms of emerging trends in the blockchain lending space, Owen points to the massive growth in the number of cryptocurrencies coming online and the innovation associated with them. He says that although it will be a bumpy ride, he believes we\u2019ll continue to see more and more of the world\u2019s value accounted for on distributed ledgers and on blockchains. \n\u201cI see a world where large portfolios will be made up of digital assets and they will be much more granular abilities to lend against these portfolios in a much higher liquid form than what we have today. This, I am certain, will solve a lot of the liquidity inefficiencies in the market.\u201d \u00a0\nThough SALT is currently operating only in the U.S., Owen anticipates making a quick move into Ireland, followed most likely by Canada. \u201cThe big picture we are striving for is to create the mechanisms with which lending terms of any type, between any person or individual, whether it be business or not, can interact in a peer-to-peer way with contracts that are enforceable without counterparty risk.\u201d \nErik Voorhees, founder and CEO of ShapeShift and a member of SALT\u2019s board of directors, commented, \u201cSALT\u2019s disruptive innovation is an important project for broadening the usefulness and global reach of blockchain technology.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 25}
{"title": "Op Ed: How One Investor Is Riding the Cryptocurrency Token Wave", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-how-one-investor-riding-cryptocurrency-token-wave/", "birthday": "May 22, 2017 2:08 PM EST", "date": "2017-05-22 19:08:00", "content": "I was yanked down the rabbit hole hard and fast when I first caught the Bitcoin Bug in late 2013. Before I even knew what a \u201cblockchain\u201d was I had founded what is now known as the Blockchain Education Network (then called the College Cryptocurrency Network), and was voraciously trading \u201caltcoins.\u201d\nBack then, the term \u201caltcoin,\u201d which was used to describe any cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin, felt quite suitable. Most of those altcoins, including the most popular still in existence today, such as Litecoin and Dogecoin, were forks of Bitcoin\u2019s code and were merely alternative \u201ccoins\u201d with different rules or hashing algorithms. Watching these strange new financial vehicles violently fluctuate in value was both addictive and impossible to resist trading into. While I was slow to inoculate myself against that masochistic urge, I was quick to realize that few of these protocol tokens (that is, crypto-assets that incentivize validators, such as miners or stakers, to secure a blockchain) provided much value beyond Bitcoin\u2019s own use case. Admittedly, I am shocked that many of these tokens still exist today. \nOn the other hand, as the blockchain ecosystem began to evolve, more novel iterations of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s revolutionary financial tool began to appear. The rise of Ethereum, BitShares, MaidSafe and Omni, amongst others, represented a paradigm shift that went far beyond decentralized digital currency. Soon enough, I dropped out of school to focus on this industry full-time, and ended up cofounding Augur, a decentralized prediction market platform.\nLessons from Augur\nWhen we first designed Augur, we wrote a white paper that outlined how to build a prediction market platform using Bitcoin\u2019s source code \u2014 sort of like an altcoin. However, Bitcoin\u2019s UTXO model did not jibe well with the sort versatility required for such a complication decentralized application. Soon after we published our white paper, despite the promise of Blockstream\u2019s recently released sidechains proposal, our advisor and Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin convinced us to build Augur on his yet-to-be-launched smart contract\u2013enabled blockchain. In hindsight, deciding to build Augur on top of what was then referred to as \u201cvaporware\u201d was a decision a more seasoned entrepreneur would have determined to be \u2026 \u201cbatshit insane.\u201d But, the potential of the platform was too great, so we felt as if we had no other option. \nSoon after deciding to build atop Ethereum, we began to realize that there was no way to create a decentralized oracle solution (i.e., a means to determine the outcome of markets without a centralized arbiter) unless we issued our own token. I went to game theorists, computer scientists and anybody else I could get to listen, to see if there was an alternative and whether it even made sense to do this. After much consultation and internal debate, we came to the decision to build an unstoppable betting engine that predicted the future, with no central point of failure (such as those that exist in a platform such as Gnosis), with a native token used by \u201creporters\u201d around the world, to assert the outcome of events, was our only option. Thus Augur\u2019s native asset, Reputation, known as REP, was born.\nVenturing Into ICOs\n2014 was winding to a close as we came to these conclusions, and the thought of performing a crowdsale was terrifying. (We would, for a short time, eradicate the term \u201cICO.\u201d) Most conversations about Ethereum and recent token sales would lead to speculation about when regulatory authorities, namely the SEC, would bring down the hammer on token issuers. \nWith no other option, however, I hit the books and started reading about all sorts of securities laws and case law, in addition to prediction market and gambling regulations. I quickly earned the nickname \u201cJG Esquire\u201d within Augur, and spent much of early 2015 working with our legal team and advisors to find a compliant structure for the REP token sale. By the time our sale came about in late summer 2015, all involved parties had a fairly high degree of confidence that we had developed a token and offering that would not fall afoul of regulations.\nExpanding Investment Opportunities in the Token Economy\nWhile our sale raised over $5 million and was quite a success for the time, shortly after the Augur sale ended bitcoin and ether prices began to stagnate. Both the confidence and companies created during the first boom began to falter. In my mind, Augur was a ripple in the current before a tidal wave of new financial instruments to come, but it was unclear whether I was right and there was considerable coding remaining for the project. \nWith time before Augur\u2019s launch, I joined Blockchain Capital as an entrepreneur-in-residence. I became an advocate for tokens backing legitimate networks and spoke about the matter frequently. However, it still took quite a while for the token economy to sprout. Then out of the blue in late 2016, ether began to rally in price, and token offerings, more popularly referred to as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), started popping up out of the blue, often raising millions in a matter of days, or even minutes. \nThis new trend was alarming to me, though in hindsight I suppose it shouldn\u2019t have been. Ethereum, with its ERC-20 protocol, which allows the straightforward development of crypto-tokens on top of its blockchain, made the urge to create new assets irresistible. Instead of requiring developers to create entirely new blockchains and protocol tokens, which had to be secured by miners or stakers (a costly, challenging undertaking), a team could create a new token that was backed by the security of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain in a matter of hours. \nFor the following few months into the new year I watched these developments from the sideline. It was apparent the biggest crypto-asset rally since 2013 had begun in earnest. I had sizable investments in ETH, BTC, XRP and, of course, REP. I couldn\u2019t believe that this bull run and new trend of ICOs could be sustained. Not, at least, without the return of serious outside interest in the crypto-realm. \nAnd then, of course, it started to come. Hedge funds, banks and consumers, many of whom had already begun professing their love of \u201cblockchain technology\u201d (albeit not Bitcoin), started funneling money into crypto-tokens new and old. Around this time, my friend Olaf Carlson-Wee, the first employee at Coinbase, announced that he would be investing in these strange financial instruments through a new type of hedge fund, Polychain Capital. \nAs I was busy working as a venture capitalist investing in traditional companies at Blockchain Capital, Olaf\u2019s new fund was a means for me to gain exposure to this crazy new trend without falling into the crypto-asset rabbit hole as I had back in college. I quickly signed on as both a General and Limited Partner, and sent Polychain my first (but not last) wire. \nBlockchain Capital\u2019s Venture Fund\nFor most of early 2016, I was content to let Olaf (and his new partner, the talented Ryan Zurrer) review and manage any new ICOs I was sent. But the trend maintained. It appeared this new generation of crypto-assets was more than a massive pump-and-dump. In fact, my firm began to explore tokens much more seriously. Though it had often been teased that it was only a matter of time before I went to jail for Augur, there was an evolution in our thought process surrounding tokens and their corresponding offerings. Soon enough, we became convinced that Blockchain Capital should offer its own token, BCAPs, in order to provide a new sort of venture fund.\nThis decision would lead us to reevaluate the traditional scope of our investments mandate. Crypto-tokens, as I had long argued, could be revolutionary (or, at least, useful) financial instruments, and it would be foolish throwing out the crypto-asset babies with the altcoin bathwater.\nProjects such as 0x, Maker, Golem and Filecoin demonstrated how much alternative crypto-tokens had evolved since the dodgy days of Doge and Darkcoin. Because of this evolution, I officially decided to take the plunge and deep-dive down the token rabbit hole once again with Blockchain Capital. In addition to my roles investing and as an entrepreneur-in-residence, I will be focusing considerable energy on the new token economy, evaluating new ICOs for the firm.\nIt is impossible for a firm such as Blockchain Capital, the earliest venture fund to state its commitment to this novel economy outside of Bitcoin, not to participate in this remarkable new chapter of the blockchain revolution. New platforms, such as AngelList\u2019s Coinlist, will standardize and add further legitimacy to such offerings.\nI am still extraordinarily skeptical of most ICOs and tokens in general, but I am more excited than ever about blockchain technology and all the ways it is bound to disrupt ingrained, outdated institutions. If decentralized applications and crypto-assets are the harbinger of such change, then I am on board. \nIt\u2019s going to be a rocky road, and there will surely be corrections (if not dramatic drops), but I can\u2019t say I haven\u2019t seen it before. I look forward to sifting through the white papers, ponzis and pumps sure to fill my inbox in the coming months in order to find the game-changing diamonds in the rough. It\u2019s going to be a wild ride. So buckle up, bring a barf bag and watch as the Crypto Rodeo brings out the bulls and bears.\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Jeremy Gardner.

He speaks of many examples\u200a \u2014 \u200afood preparation standards, languages and taboos. \nThis principle can also extend to Bitcoin and the concept of soft forks. By extending this principle, it can show that a soft fork that has strong support from a minority still may be enough to provide economic incentives to its enforcement, even if the majority is ambivalent.\nSoft forks, by their nature, are a form of intolerance. Users who enforce a soft fork are intolerant of some types of transactions or blocks that miners can produce. They will reject those blocks that miners produce much as an Orthodox Jew will reject pork. In cases where the majority is ambivalent and the cost for producers is low to adhere to the stricter standards, then the result is producers keep everyone happy by following those stricter standards. \nIn Bitcoin\u2019s case, many potential soft forks fall into this category. Soft forks that do not degrade the security properties of Bitcoin, that do not take away from any currently used features, do not add costs to miners, and are preferred by some, would result in profit-maximizing miners choosing to serve a wider audience by enforcing the soft fork.\nStrong-Willed Minority vs. Ambivalent Majority\nIn the above case, if there were strong believers committed to a soft fork with stricter rules, miners face a choice \u200a\u2014 \u200ado they allow the chain to split or serve everyone with the new stricter rules? If they allow the chain to split, they must pick a subset of users to serve, giving them less value than if they were to serve all. This also harms the network effect, which means the sum of the two parts is now worth less than the original. Thus, as long as the minority committed to the soft fork was sufficient in size that they cannot be ignored, a profit-maximizing miner will follow them (assuming there is little to no cost of enforcement).\nStrong-Willed Minority vs. Miners\u2019 Interests\nIn a case where a strong-willed minority requires non-GMO, organically certified food, this may not result in the minority getting its way. The cost of production may be too high to be worth it. A theoretical soft fork that reduces the block reward by half would be a good example. A minority may feel the block reward is too high and wish that it be lowered, and only allow miners to claim 6.25 coins instead of 12.5 per block. In this case, miners would give up a significant amount of income to have to enforce it, and the loss of \u201cbusiness\u201d from excluding these users may be less costly than reducing their income.\nStrong-Willed Minority vs. Strong-Willed Minority\nA third case is when a strong-willed majority ends up alienating another portion of the potential consumers. If a new religious sect required that all food have bacon added to it, Jews and Muslims would not tolerate this and would splinter off, even if the majority did not care either way. In this case, a split is inevitable. \nIn the Bitcoin case, some users may wish to have all addresses logged in a government registry to ease KYC compliance. They could demand that miners only mine blocks that adhere to these standards. This type of action would be rejected by many users who would not go along with such a plan, and in fact may even take steps to block it if it was enforced. In this case, a split would be inevitable if both factions were sufficiently intolerant of the other.\nThe Importance of Commitment and Stubbornness\nThis only works if users are absolutely committed to their rules being followed. Commitment must be absolute and unwilling to change, no matter what the majority does. The most important part of the intolerant minority is to truly be intolerant! If the cause is not worth putting your neck on the line for, it will not be successful. \nSome supporters of user-activated soft forks (UASFs) have stated that they intend to enforce the UASF unless it is not widely supported or followed, and then would back off. This is the surest way to guarantee failure. If you are unwilling to follow a minority chain with an economic minority, you aren\u2019t truly an intolerant minority. You are only one with a preference.\nGuidelines for User-Activated Soft Forks for Maximizing Success\nTake away no existing useful features (do not create a hostile minority).Do not add significant costs to miners (make burden for miners as low as possible).Include functionality that users are willing to fork off for.Ensure there is a sufficiently sized minority willing to commit.\nA sufficiently sized, committed, economic minority is enough to have a successful user-activated soft fork. While Shaolinfry said that without an economic majority behind a soft fork, it should be withdrawn, I believe that statement to be too weak. The history of intolerant minorities making changes is long enough to show otherwise.\nThis guest post by Alphonse Pace was originally published on Medium and is reproduced here under Creative Commons license.

In the few weeks since the announcement, active blockchain communities and events such as RegHack DownUnder have launched across the country, supported by universities and government regulators.\nAustralia has traditionally held strict tax laws when it comes to how they handle bitcoin and other digital currencies, defining bitcoin as a separate asset class to fiat currency and requiring that transactions involving digital currencies are taxed twice by the Australian Tax Office. The new budget summary removes any general sales tax made more than once in the supply chain using digital currency, in an attempt to \u201cmake it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia\u201d and to grow their nascent community into a global innovation hub. \nThe summary states, \u201cThe Government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global financial technology (FinTech) hub and is announcing a new package that aims to position our local fintech industry as a world leader.\u201d\nThis new regulatory environment has spurred growth in the community, from university campuses all the way up to the government regulators. Students have begun to launch clubs at universities across the country, and regulators and business executives have begun to take notice.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited blockchain [technology] can finally move to our campus and Australia in a big way. There\u2019s been a significant increase in interest from the community in the past few weeks,\u201c said Ryan Pousson, the regional head of the Blockchain Education Network (BEN) in Brisbane and the founder of the UQ Blockchain Club, in a statement to Bitcoin Magazine. This perspective was echoed by Jared Piper, a region head of the Blockchain Education Network in Melbourne. \nAaron Schwartz, the director of global engagement at BEN and partner at MLG Capital, told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cIt\u2019s super exciting to be part of a decentralized organization like BEN that is doing something unique with a swarm-style model. We are quickly spreading to countries all across the world with new chapters opening up across Australia, Colombia, Nigeria and Bangalore, just to name a few. We encourage anyone in a blockchain community around the world to reach out to get started growing their local community.\u201d\nOn the weekend of May 12\u201314, government representatives in the energy sector and banking executives in the financial services industry came together to judge RegHack DownUnder. The brightest developers, UI/UX designers and entrepreneurs across Australia were encouraged to spend the weekend in Melbourne to develop blockchain technology solutions to solve some of the problems it faces in these two heavily regulated sectors. \nIn advance of the hackathon, Adam Lemmon, a blockchain expert from Toronto, flew down to Melbourne to present an overview of Ethereum development and Solidity to the community. Following the event, Lemmon said, \u201cRegHack was an amazing experience and it was inspiring to see such a young blockchain community so excited about the technology.\u201d \nChami Akmeemana, the organizer of RegHack DownUnder, predicts a fast growth in the community. He said to Bitcoin Magazine following the event: \u201cIt was a mammoth success. Close to 100 participants spent three days exploring tech solutions to regulatory issues. We now have 100+ blockchain enthusiasts, that I expect [will grow] to over 1000+ by the end of the year. I\u2019m hoping to see some world-class blockchain applications coming out of Australia and I\u2019m stoked to be part of this boost to the ecosystem.\u201d\nThe regulators in Australia are on board too with this digital transformation. Igor Simunovic, a representative from the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), said in a statement following the event that \u201cthe event provided opportunity for industry (including government) and freelancers/students/developers to meet, integrate and share through the problem solving required to address the Hackathon \u2018problems.\u2019 Such meeting and teamwork opportunities are rare and often bound by the [confines] of conferences or meet-ups. The process of discovering new technologies and frameworks was just a bonus.\u201d\nIt is still the beginning in the growth trajectory of the blockchain community in Australia, but it is an exciting time to be part of a global movement.

This comes as the heavily regulated power industry eyeballs new approaches for allowing consumers to generate and sell electricity in various locales worldwide.\nIt\u2019s here that blockchain technology is increasingly being seen as a potential, low-cost means for delivering energy transactions across a distributed network without need for a centralized authority. In fact, some surmise that blockchains may one day eliminate the need for intermediaries altogether, thereby allowing a more free market approach to energy distribution. \nBlockchain tech could also boost efficiency by serving as the backbone for \u201csmart grid\u201d systems, automatically identifying and addressing network hitches that may arise. Moreover, when tethered with the Internet of Things (IoT) movement, energy devices such as those used for heating, cooling, ventilation, electric vehicles, solar installations and even batteries will be able to interact with one another, resulting in greater cost savings. \nNot to be overlooked is the enhanced cybersecurity element that blockchain technology offers for an industry that has become increasingly susceptible to cyberattacks.\nDespite blockchain technology\u2019s potential utility, industry adoption may pose a number of gritty challenges. For starters, the energy grid is fraught with complexity associated with managing the process continuum of materials management, energy generation and delivery. Moreover, prevailing recordkeeping and data management systems remain cumbersome, resulting in costly missteps when it come to energy trading and asset ownership tracking. \nGlobal Experimentation Abounds\nAs the intersection between blockchain technology and the energy sector advances, experimental demonstration projects are taking shape throughout the world. \nLast year, the blockchain-centric Brooklyn Microgrid project, a peer-to-peer energy market for local renewable energy generation, attracted quite a bit of media attention. The intent of the startup is to deliver solar panels to this New York borough\u2019s rooftops, allowing local residents to purchase and offload electricity within their community. This initiative allows for a system that bypasses power companies, thereby creating a generation-and-storage ecosystem that works in a more independent and efficient manner. \nIn another example, Austria\u2019s largest regional utility company, Wien Energie, in collaboration with the Canadian blockchain startup BTL Group has engaged in a blockchain trial run targeting energy trading with two other utilities. The objective? To gather a repository of knowledge about blockchain technology, assessing the viability of it and relevant business models for the industry. This pilot ran from March to May 2017 and is expected to generate a set of new commercial strategies to explore. \nAdditionally, the SP Group, Singapore\u2019s energy provider, will be developing blockchain solutions in partnerships with other providers throughout the world, with the goal of lowering consumer utility costs in that nation. This initiative is also intended to create simpler mechanisms for integrating new renewable energy sources into the mix. \nAndre De Castro, founder of the NY-based Blockchain of Things and Catenis Enterprise \u2014 which delivers blockchain solutions for simplifying and accelerating secure global peer-to-peer edge device messaging, digital asset control, and recording of immutable data \u2014 tells Bitcoin Magazine that blockchain technology is just the beginning foundation for advancing the energy sector. \u201cHaving a distributed database doesn\u2019t necessarily get you a trading system or an application. So what\u2019s really needed is an application layer on top of the blockchain, to get real-world solutions.\u201d \u00a0\nDe Castro says that his company enables the creation of digital assets, more commonly known as tokens, that can be applied to energy units across endpoints to create new business models for energy markets. \u201cEverything is moving toward more open exchanges when it comes to the energy industry. Therefore consumers will soon be able to choose their own energy providers and even resell energy to their neighbors in certain areas of the world.\u201d\nHe notes one additional benefit to the advancements, namely that the global Bitcoin blockchain is incredibly secure due to the fact that transactions can be cryptographically verified, thereby protecting critical assets on the energy grid. \u201cThis addresses a major challenge that currently exists today involving utility systems where there is a reliance on centralized cloud servers. What we\u2019ve developed at Catenis with the blockchain allows for decentralization and the elimination of central points of failure that could affect big swaths of the energy grid.\u201d\nUltimately, De Castro sees a day where blockchain technology will foster the creation of more flexible business models for exchanging power in open markets and selling that power back to the main energy grid. He also believes that this will open up immense opportunities in the clean energy space, welcome news for the eco-friendly movement. \u201cI believe that control mechanism allowing digital tokens to be mapped will become more common resulting in lower energy costs while making peer-to-peer exchanges more efficient.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 22}

It is also the name of a Swiss-based company that created the world\u2019s first trustless asset portfolio for acquiring digital assets without counterparty risk. \nLaunched today at the blockchain summit Consensus 2017 held in New York, the cutting-edge platform known as Prism seeks to usher in a new age for investors with a thirst for cryptocurrencies. \nThe Prism announcement comes on the heels of record-setting growth within the cryptocurrency market, with bitcoin among others advancing to new all-time price highs. Momentum has been further buoyed by a blockchain industry that is already experiencing an incredible diversity of projects, from tokenized venture capital funds to blockchain-based casinos to global distributed computing systems. Prism is the first live platform that enables investors to create their own funds focused on investments in crypto-assets.\nThis new development is the brainchild of Erik Voorhees, long-time champion of and entrepreneur in the Bitcoin space. ShapeShift, the company he founded in 2013, raised $10.4m during its Series A from leading German VCs in March 2017 to jumpstart this new venture. \nBuilt entirely on Ethereum-based smart contracts, Prism will enable investors to curate portfolios, known as \u201cPrisms,\u201d of digital assets known as \u201cPrisms,\u201d such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Dash, Monero and Golem. Within minutes, an investor can set up a crypto portfolio \u2014 absent of third-party intermediaries \u2014 and gain exposure to a wide swath of blockchain tokens. Moreover, they can secure their investments without having to establish a unique wallet for each asset. \nWith Prism, users will create their portfolios by funding it with ether (the native token of the Ethereum blockchain network). The total amount of ether is divided among whichever assets they decide on, in percentages they elect to allocate to each asset. When the investor is ready to finalize their Prism portfolio, they will be prompted to send a zero-ETH transaction to a provided Ethereum address, signaling the smart contract to close the portfolio. \nThe beta period for Prism will likely extend for at least six months after the launch, with new features being added over time. \nPrism\u2019s approach and philosophy offers an ideal complement to ShapeShift and its established reputation for securing over a million secure transactions for customers since 2014. ShapeShift\u2019s policy of not holding any customer assets or private personal information keeps users safe from identity or financial theft \u2014 a critical improvement in digital exchange technology.\nShapeShift is now leveraging their proven model of simplicity and security to cultivate Prism. With this latest development, the complex functionality of a diversified crypto portfolio is distilled down into a simple interface allowing users to buy, rebalance and settle their assets. All of this can be executed by a user with nothing more than their Ethereum wallet. \nPrism enables investors to gain secure, transparent exposure to digital assets in a way that has never before been possible. The days of leaving funds at an exchange \u2018because it\u2019s easier\u2019 are over. -\u00a0Erik Voorhees, CEO and founder of ShapeShift and Prism\nVoorhees goes on to assert that Prism\u2019s digital asset portfolios, built entirely on non-custodial smart contracts, will demonstrate a new normal for financial security. \u201cPrism takes us one step closer to a world of truly borderless finance. We suspect it will kickstart a vast horizon of financial experimentation upon smart contracts.\u201d\nRaine Revere, lead engineer for the Prism project, says that ShapeShift\u2019s focus on simplicity and security was a perfect fit for the design of Prism. \u201cPart of the joy of engineering is seeing how all the pieces will fit together and then systematically carrying out that vision in order to build a working product. That link between vision and functional product is what makes software engineering so special. The vision of Prism was clear from the beginning, allowing this creative process to proceed uninhibited.\u201d\n\n\u201cGone are the days of trusting a 3rd party with one\u2019s wealth,\" said Voorhees in a statement. \"Prism\u2019s digital asset portfolios, built entirely on non-custodial smart contracts, demonstrates a new standard in financial security.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 22}

The name of the new solution is KYCstart (pronounced \u201ckickstart\u201d). KYCstart creates digital identities for new customers that can then be used across different platforms and institutions, thereby making the customer onboarding process much more efficient while also reducing costs. \nCurrently, when a new customer is being onboarded by a financial institution, the process involves an employee of the compliance department electronically filling out KYC (Know Your Customer) forms, which include information such as place of incorporation, ownership structure, whether they are regulated or not, whether they have any legal proceedings against them, and what type of business will be conducted with them. \nTo gather this information, compliance officers will regularly need to reach out to the potential customer via email and phone as well as scroll through the regulator\u2019s database to find any recorded wrongdoings and confirm the regulatory status of the customer. \nDeloitte\u2019s new proposed model of completing the onboarding process, however, involves regulated KYC added-value service providers, which are authorized to perform KYC checks for customers who would like to be onboarded by financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies and investment management firms. \u00a0\nCustomers and clients could then control who their company information is being shared with and would be able to keep track of the authorizations using blockchain-based smart contracts.\n\u201cWith this proof of concept and related ecosystem, we demonstrate the benefits of using blockchain [technology] and smart contract[s] to considerably reduce the costs of one of the most important burdens of our institutional clients: KYC and customer onboarding,\u201d Chollet explained.\nBlockchain Technology Is Making Waves in RegTech \nRegTech (regulatory technology), a relatively new branch of financial technology, focuses on leveraging innovative new technologies to improve regulatory reporting and monitoring as well as compliance processes for financial institutions. \nThe financial industry is particularly keen on this subsector of fintech as financial regulations have tightened substantially since the 2008 global financial crisis, which has led banks to invest heavily in the areas of KYC/AML, compliance and risk management. Hence, any solution that will help banks to streamline their processes and reduce overheads will be very welcome by financial situations. \nAs Bitcoin Magazine reported in April, blockchain technology is making waves in RegTech. The integration of distributed ledger technology into compliance systems and processes could save financial institutions up to 50 percent in compliance costs, according to blockchain startup Coinfirm and management consulting firm Accenture. \nUsing blockchain technology, data security could be improved, manual processes could be digitized, customer onboarding documents could be verified for authenticity, the speed and accuracy of daily regulatory reporting to regulators could be increased, and digital identities could be created for companies, which can then be shared among permissioned financial institutions, as Deloitte\u2019s new KYC-as-a-service product is aiming to do. \nDeloitte plans to roll out its new KYC-as-a-service solution to financial institutions this summer, and the newly developed KYCstart will be one of the proposed onboarding channels for this service.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 10}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\n\nIt\u2019s official. Litecoin, one of the oldest and biggest altcoins by market cap, deployed Segregated Witness (SegWit) today. The protocol upgrade that was originally developed for Bitcoin and proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team locked in on Litecoin two weeks ago, and was enforced by a majority of hash power on the Litecoin network as of a couple of hours ago.\nThe Segregated Witness soft fork activated without major issues \u2014 though there was an early slip up by the biggest Litecoin mining pool on the network.\n\u201cF2Pool had a hiccup where they were not mining Litecoin correctly. For some reason their LTC pool was returning a BTC template to miners. We reached out to them and they fixed it right away,\u201d Litecoin inventor Charlie Lee told Bitcoin Magazine.\nSegWit\nLaunched in 2011, Litecoin was one of the first altcoins to gain significant traction. As opposed to some newer altcoins like Ethereum, Ripple and Monero, Litecoin is a straight fork of Bitcoin\u2019s codebase but with a different mining algorithm and some changed parameters, such as faster confirmation times. This similarity to Bitcoin does mean that Litecoin suffers from similar weaknesses as Bitcoin, like transaction malleability. \nAnd, indeed, that it can adopt similar solutions and improvements, like Segregated Witness.\nWhile Litecoin inventor Charlie Lee has been advocating for activation of the soft fork since late 2016, miner support initially did not follow. This changed following the Global LTC Roundtable Meeting, an online meeting held amongst prominent stakeholders in the Litecoin industry, who are based particularly in China. The participants agreed on \u201cLitecoin Global Roundtable Resolution 001 (2017),\u201d which, among other things, holds that the mining pools would activate SegWit.\nWith its SegWit activation, the \u201csilver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold\u201d has immediately reclaimed a place in the spotlight, and the markets have been taking notice. Having lingered in Bitcoin\u2019s shadow for years at price levels below $5, Litecoin\u2019s exchange rate surged almost tenfold in anticipation of SegWit. The altcoin reached almost $40 today and is trading around $33 at time of publication.\nBitcoin\nPerhaps even more important, some prominent Bitcoin projects \u2014 like .NET Bitcoin library NBitcoin and wallet mSIGNA \u2014 announced to port their work to Litecoin now that it has enabled SegWit. Even more notable, Lightning Labs will roll out a version of their lightning network implementation on Litecoin, while ACINQ has tested their lightning software on the altcoin, too. Similarly, Bitcoin Core developer Johnson Lau, one of the authors of SegWit, has indicated that he will realize smart-contracting solution MAST on Litecoin. \nFurther down the road, Segregated Witness enables more innovations that could be deployed on Litecoin first. Confidential Transactions, Schnorr signatures and TumbleBit are all in the works for Bitcoin, and shouldn\u2019t take too much effort to port to Litecoin. \nLee himself, furthermore, hopes that atomic swaps will soon see the light of day, enabling an instant and trustless altcoin exchange and lightning network type of transactions across different digital currencies. \n\u201cSegWit opens up the doors to many amazing features that can be added to Litecoin,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThese include Lightning Network, MAST, Confidential Transactions, Schnorr Signatures and more. I think Litecoin can show Bitcoin that SegWit is indeed the best way to improve the protocol. So I think it will help get that happening sooner on Bitcoin.\u201d\nSegregated Witness is still pending activation on Bitcoin, where it requires 95 percent hash power support. It has stagnated at around 30 percent so far.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 10}

Bitcoin itself, however, is still struggling with legitimacy and regulation issues. Just this week, the fact that bitcoin was chosen as the payment method for the latest round of global data ransomware attacks, WanaCrypt0r 2.0 malware, has underscored the negative perception that still swirls around the cryptocurrency.\nOn the most recent episode of Epicenter, co-hosts Brian Fabian Crain and Meher Roy interviewed \u00a0Peter Van Valkenburgh, Director of Research of Coin Center, a nonprofit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing decentralized financial networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. During the interview, Van Valkenburgh explained how Bitcoin is currently dealing with its branding issue; how Coin Center is laying the groundwork for future discussions about Bitcoin regulation; and how more mainstream uses of the technology would be helpful for discussions around regulation.\nBitcoin\u2019s Branding Issue\nVan Valkenburgh noted how Coin Center has struggled with the issues around Bitcoin as a brand, as many in the mainstream associate the digital currency with the collapse of Mt. Gox and drug sales on darknet markets.\n\u201cWe take a lot of meetings with congressional staff, we take meetings with regulators at [the United States] Treasury, and oftentimes we can\u2019t take credit for those meetings because a congressman doesn\u2019t want it, necessarily, to immediately hit the news that he\u2019s meeting with the Bitcoin people,\u201d said Van Valkenburgh.\nFrom Van Valkenburgh\u2019s viewpoint, networks like Bitcoin are used to \u201cdecentralize power\u201d and push security to end users\u2019 devices. \u201cThat means you lose the choke point for regulation because the choke point for regulation is the bank, the choke point for regulation is the centralized intermediary,\u201d he explained.\nVan Valkenburgh went on to note that, since control over these networks is pushed to the edges, the technology can potentially be used for illicit activities.\nLaying the Groundwork for a Future Debate\nOne of the illicit activities that regulators and journalists sometimes associate with Bitcoin is terrorism. Although there haven\u2019t been any major terrorist attacks funded through Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency up to this point, that we know of, Van Valkenburgh pointed out that it\u2019s \u201cpossible that one day somebody will use these networks in a meaningful way\u201d to finance that sort of activity.\nAccording to Van Valkenburgh, one of Coin Center\u2019s main goals is to prepare for the potential conversation that would take place within government in the aftermath of such an event.\n\u201cWhat will be the government response when this tool is used in a way that a lot of people get upset about?\u201d asked Van Valkenburgh. \u201cOur metric of success, I think truly, would be a reasonable response to clear evidence of illicit uses of the technology \u2014 like dangerous, illicit uses of the technology.\u201d\nFor Van Valkenburgh, success for Coin Center in such a scenario would mean the prevention of a push for an instant ban of Bitcoin and other related technologies, along with software developers not getting arrested as part of the process. Coin Center is effectively laying the groundwork to make sure these future conversations remain reasonable.\n\u201cThis is a technology and, just like all technologies, it can be used for good and for evil,\u201d said Van Valkenburgh. \u201cWe are not, as Americans, in the business of banning technologies. We\u2019re not in the business of banning speech.\u201d\nMore \u201cLegitimate\u201d Use Cases Needed\nGoing back to the aforementioned branding issue, one possible way to improve the outlook on Bitcoin from a regulatory perspective is to create more mainstream use cases for the technology. This point was originally brought up by Crain.\n\u201cIf you have stuff where there is 50 million users and they are like, \u2018This thing is great. It really makes something possible that I couldn\u2019t do before. It\u2019s a totally legitimate thing, and this is amazing.\u2019 It would be so much harder if it\u2019s still this kind of fringe thing,\u201d said Crain.\nVan Valkenburgh agreed with Crain\u2019s assessment and continued, \u201cYou need the legitimate use cases to emerge. You need to show that you\u2019re making a positive impact on the world \u2014 that it\u2019s not just a bunch of people getting rich off of token sales or people using underground drug markets.\u201d\nVan Valkenburgh added that Coin Center hopes to clear the way, at least from a regulatory perspective, for these sort of mainstream applications to appear. \u201cThe longer we go without more mainstream, legitimate uses, the more danger we\u2019re in,\u201d he added.\nAs far as mainstream uses of Bitcoin today, Van Valkenburgh pointed to the financial autonomy enabled by the technology, and he identified WikiLeaks\u2019s use of Bitcoin to get around a financial blockade back in 2011 as a specific example. However, Van Valkenburgh also added that this example has become more politically charged since allegations of WikiLeaks working directly with Russia have appeared.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 13}

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nAs Bitcoin continues its bull run, the top alts by market capitalization have also made strides of their own. Ripple shot to new all-time highs (ATHs) this week and Litecoin has now activated SegWit, a block size and scalability protocol change. Litecoin will continue to receive further protocol upgrades made possible through SegWit activation. Ethereum is due for a protocol change, Metropolis, in the form of a hard fork sometime later this year. From a user standpoint, a competitive protocol change and upgrade environment with active developers amongst the top coins ensure these technologies will continue to push the limits of finance and beyond.\n\nDespite showing some signs of slowing last week, Ethereum continues to break hash rate ATHs, now at almost 25,000 GH/s, suggesting that miner confidence in the future of Ethereum remains strong.\n\nGDAX continues to take the lion\u2019s share of volume, suggesting that USD fiat on-ramping remains strong. Bitfinex also continues to sit slightly higher in price than the other exchanges due to ongoing USD deposit and withdrawal issues.\n\nEthereum has had two recent chart patterns that failed to complete to their respective targets, seen here on the four-hour timeframe. \n\nThere was a large bearish formation, head and shoulders, which failed to break below the 200 EMA despite having the matching volume profile. Most recently, there was a bullish continuation pattern, cup and handle, which failed to cleanly break horizontal resistance with volume. For determination of trend, the position of price relative to the 200 EMA is the gold standard. Despite two failed chart patterns, trend remains bullish while above the 200 EMA. A break of this range with volume should be the deciding factor for direction.\nThe daily timeframe is also showing no threat to trend with the most recent pullback due to a bearish divergence, measured from RSI, a momentum oscillator. While hindsight now, this is the type of structure \u2014 higher high in price and lower high in momentum \u2014 to identify before the price reversals occur. RSI has also reset to around 50, which usually suggests continuation of trend after correction.\n\nOn the 30-minute timeframe, there is an active bullish reversal chart pattern known as the Adam and Eve double bottom. The Adam, a steep V, and Eve, a gentle U, is a very common fractal pattern when solid support has formed. The measured move for resolution is the distance from horizontal resistance to the bottom of support, projected upward, which yields a target of ~$100 (0.0572).\n\nThis horizontal resistance is also a key zone that broke upward previously after a triangle consolidation.\nSummary\nThe competitive development milieu for the top cryptocurrencies is important to ensuring a healthy user experience.Hash rate suggests continued miner belief in the strong future of Ethereum. Although range-bound after two large but failed chart patterns, trend remains bullish.A low-timeframe double bottom pattern suggests support has formed and price will shortly return to the top of the range.\u00a0\nTrading and investing in digital assets is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

The old argument of bitcoin opponents that bitcoin is inferior to fiat currency as it does not pay interest has long been untrue. \nSeveral bitcoin exchanges, including Bitfinex and Poloniex, offer users the possibility to lend bitcoin to margin traders in return for daily interest payments. Furthermore, U.K.-based bitcoin savings account providers BSave and Magnr also pay interest on bitcoin deposits. \nRisk/Return on Bitcoin Deposits\nThe idea of earning a fixed interest on bitcoin holdings may sound appealing to investors, especially those who consider themselves long-term holders. However, a fixed-term bitcoin deposit is not the same as a fixed-term deposit in fiat currency, as the former comes with no regulatory protection should the company with which users deposit their funds goes bankrupt. Coincheck actually highlights this fact on their lending page, stating that \u201cusers have a risk [of] not being able to receive deposited cryptocurrencies in a case [where] Coincheck [goes] bankrupt.\u201d \nJapan\u2019s Financial Services Agency stated that Coincheck\u2019s deposit service is exempt from the country\u2019s banking regulations as bitcoin is not legal tender. However, should bitcoin become a mainstream payment method in Japan, services such as Coincheck\u2019s bitcoin deposit accounts could receive their own regulatory requirements.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 10}

Part of the Stellar network open financial protocol, Lightyear aims to revolutionize the world of cross-border, cross-currency and cross-asset transactions by creating a universal global payment network.\nThe pair is hoping to play a disruptive role in the global payments space with Lightyear by aggressively pursuing a global mission of creating an open and public financial infrastructure, enabling greater access for individuals, lowering costs for banks and increasing revenue for businesses. \nAccording to a research study by McKinsey & Company, the global payments industry will generate an estimated $2.2 trillion in revenue by 2020. This represents a $400 billion increase over 2015 ($1.8 trillion) with an average growth rate of 5 percent.\nThe fuel behind Lightyear, Stellar, is backed by Stripe, the Bitcoin API that powers commerce for businesses of all sizes. Stellar counts some of the biggest names in fintech, such as Keith Rabois, previously EVP of Paypal and COO of Square, and Greg Brockman, previously CTO of Stripe, as board members. \nStellar\u2019s open financial protocol allows for the settlement of transactions almost in real-time (3-5 seconds), for fractions of a cent, all in a secure and safe network. Stellar\u2019s network has been integrated by startups, tech companies and financial institutions in more than 55 countries. \nOver the past year, there\u2019s been a surge of interest from partners in the Asia-Pacific region \u2014 including remittance companies such as Coin.ph, the Chinese tech giant LeEco and major banks, such as the Indian multinational bank and financial services company ICICI \u2014 to integrate with the Stellar network for support of cross-border payments. Given this demand, it became evident that a new organizational model for the seamless exchange between currencies was required for Stellar\u2019s global partner activities.\nThe creation of Lightyear now will allow Stellar.org to keep its efforts targeted at its primary mission of managing the open source project and overseeing the foundation\u2019s lumen distribution program. Lightyear will focus on a wider swath of activities, including supporting global partner integrations, as well as marketing and distribution activities on the Stellar network. In the coming months, Lightyear.io will unveil its service and product offerings.\nPrior to his work in creating Stellar, McCaleb previously launched eDonkey2000, which became one of the largest file-sharing networks of its time. He later created the first digital currency exchange, Mt. Gox, followed by Ripple, which he\u00a0co-founded with Chris Larsen.\nIn a phone interview with Bitcoin Magazine, he expressed excitement about the opportunity to collaborate with his friend and colleague Brit Yonge in launching Lightyear. \nA driving inspiration behind their work, he says, is the broken nature of the world\u2019s financial infrastructure: one that leaves all too many people without resources to live freely. \n\nWhile payments work OK in the U.S. and Europe, there is a lot more friction in places like Nigeria where more than half the people don\u2019t have bank accounts and have to pay outrageous fees for moving their money around. It just makes sense to want start in places like that.\u00a0\n\nHis partner, Yonge, echoed that sentiment. \u201cWe want to see the world of payments and sending money become as easy and free as sending an email. Jed has already basically created a way to drastically reduce the price of payments through Stellar,\u201d Yonge told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThink about the potential implications of this when the poorest people in the world are getting the worst end of the stick in terms of monetary transactions.\u201d \u00a0\nMcCaleb was optimistic about overcoming regulatory hurdles tied to Stellar and Lightyear: \u201cWe\u2019ve been quite surprised that the regulators have been fairly positive. In some ways that\u2019s not surprising because for many of the players in this space, the regulatory story doesn\u2019t really change.\u201d \nHe says that because Stellar is simply connecting existing financial institutions to each other, it actually makes compliance easier for the institutions because everything is tracked and is very obvious on the blockchain. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t circumvent these regulatory controls. So they are pretty much OK with it.\u201d \u00a0\nMcCaleb notes that correspondence banks are often a bottleneck in terms of the flow of money from institutions to end users. Stellar and Lightyear simply want to makes the system better and more efficient. \n\"Today when you want to send money from, say, Uruguay to Brazil, it has to actually go through the U.S. first because of the way the correspondence banking system is set up. This inefficiency creates a lot of frustration for people because it makes the process more expensive and slower. So we continue to forge forward in our efforts to change how all of that is done, so that money and assets can go from country A to country B without having to go through some sort of intermediary.\"\nPrior to joining Lightyear, Brit Yonge was head of Asia for Palantir Technologies. There, he oversaw the company\u2019s engagements within the financial sector where his team delivered solutions for anti-money laundering, trade finance and cybersecurity.\nIn his brief time with Lightyear thus far, Yonge has participated in talks with some central bankers who, he says, are still getting comfortable with the new technological approaches being proposed. \n\u201cThis is a very new idea, maybe not in computing where we have a lot of technologies that are distributed,\u201d said Yonge. \u201cBut it certainly is a new idea in finance in terms of the use of a distributed ledger. A lot of these conversations, therefore, involve a great deal of education, and the tone \u2014 given the potentially disruptive nature of this change \u2014 has not been adversarial at all. In fact to the contrary, the parties that we\u2019ve talked to have been very positive, respectful and eager to learn about what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us it\u2019s all about the creation of a universal payment network. \u00a0I think would be really good for the world because we all make payments.\u201d \u00a0- Jed McCaleb\n", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 11}

The platform, which currently supports bitcoin and ether trading, has reported significant increase in both the number of users trading digital currencies and the volume of digital currencies traded on the platform.\nOver the last 12 months, eToro has seen a 4x growth in traders accessing the digital currency market. Volume of bitcoin and ether traded has skyrocketed 4,500 percent. \nMati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, told Bitcoin Magazine that as digital currencies are becoming increasingly mainstream, the company expects a significant pickup in trading and would consider introducing new digital currencies on eToro, \u201cthough nothing is currently set in stone.\u201d \n\u201cWe are constantly reviewing our offer for traders and responding to demand on the platform,\u201d he said. \nFor Greenspan, the rapid growth in the adoption and price of digital currencies \u201conly marks the first steps on the long journey to establishing cryptocurrencies as a dominant force in forex trading.\u201d \nBitcoin Price Hits All-Time Highs\nBitcoin price has risen over 18 percent this week. The digital currency is currently trading at an all-time high of $1,800 USD/BTC. \n\u201cThe Bitcoin landmarks are coming thick and fast now. Crossing the $1,500 mark for the first time is an important moment for the asset. The rise of bitcoin this year has been remarkable,\u201d said Greenspan.\nOptimism in the market comes from recent news from Japan that over ten companies are planning to open digital currency exchanges in the country amid surging demand from investors and a favorable regulatory landscape. \n\u201cIt seems that the tipping point for Bitcoin will come from Japan,\u201d Greenspan said. \u201cThe Japanese government is actively trying to devalue the yen in order to discourage people from saving money. On the other hand, they\u2019ve just made bitcoin a legal currency for savings and transactions. If you lived in Japan, what portion of your savings would you choose to invest in bitcoin?\n\u201cThese kinds of real-world applications and incentives provide the scope for continued rises in the price of bitcoin. Expect more landmark moments to follow.\u201d \nIn April, Japan passed a new law recognizing bitcoin as a legal method of payment. Bitcoin exchanges are now required to obtain a special license, and must comply with anti-money laundering/know-your-customer requirements. Starting in July, Japan\u2019s consumption tax will no longer apply to purchases of digital currencies. \nOptimism was also encouraged by renewed hope that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve the bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. \nThe SEC is currently reviewing its earlier decision to reject the bitcoin ETF. The proposal involves listing the ETF on the Bats BZX exchange, one of the largest U.S. equities market operator. \nBats filed a notice of petition to review the SEC decision, which was accepted on April 24. \n\u201cThe recent debate over whether to introduce a bitcoin ETF, for example, is the sort of news that will continue to put previously mysterious cryptocurrencies on the map among traders,\u201d said Greenspan. \nTrader sentiments toward both Bitcoin and Ethereum have remained consistently bullish on eToro. Bitcoin has seen 15 consecutive months of over 80 percent of bitcoin traders buying the asset, whilst sentiments toward Ethereum have been even higher with well over 90 percent of ether traders buying the asset since its launch on the eToro platform in March this year. \nThe price of ether rose 566 percent in the past three months, surging from $15 per ether in March to cross the $100 mark last week. \neToro is a social trading and multi-asset brokerage company with offices in Cyprus, Israel and the U.K. Serving over 4.5 million users, eToro provides a marketplace for people to trade contracts for differences (CFDs) in currencies, stocks, commodities, indices and ETFs. \nIts patented CopyTrader technology allows users to copy the trading strategies of the platform\u2019s most successful traders. \neToro launched bitcoin trading in early 2014.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 12}

Chris is also a senior interpreter and translator.\nAcross China, blockchain technology is recognized as an increasingly important development; however, bitcoin as a \u201cvirtual good\u201d in China is facing yet another challenge from the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC).\nOn May 10, 2017, China\u2019s top-tier financial media outlet, Caixin, reported that \u201caccording to a person close to PBOC, PBOC will soon issue a notice of penalties to BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi for irregularities based on its previous inspection in the past few months. The major problems are [related to] illegal margin trading services and lack of internal controls for anti-money laundering. The related penalty details have already been confirmed internally; all that is left to do is go through approval procedures.\u201d\nCaixin also stated that, according to their source, further \u201cregulation on bitcoin exchange and regulation on anti-money laundering systems for bitcoin exchange will likely be released in June.\u201d\n\u201cA person close to PBOC\u201d is a common citation used by Caixin. Considered to be the most influential media in China\u2019s economic and political sphere, Caixin is usually the first outlet in China to disclose any news from the PBOC related to Bitcoin, and always has insider access. It is, in effect, a mouthpiece by which the PBOC communicates with bitcoin exchanges and the Bitcoin community as a whole. \nIt is worth noting, however, that Caixin often tends to exaggerate the PBOC\u2019s actual political influence. For example, when the PBOC inspected the three biggest exchanges, Caixin said the PBOC would \u201cthoroughly inspect and regulate\u201d them. However, the official statement released by the PBOC merely suggested that the PBOC, together with the local financial office, would \u201cinspect exchanges.\u201d Similarly, Caixin said, \u201cWith staunch resolution and with bottom-level efforts, the local Financial Office and PBOC [would] jointly resolve the bitcoin exchange issue.\u201d \nThe result of this consistent tonal bias from China\u2019s most influential media, as it represents the interests of the PBOC, is to portray Bitcoin\u2019s public image in China as still something deeply connected with price volatility and money laundering, and in need of severe government regulation. As to Bitcoin\u2019s features like decentralization and P2P transactions, Caixin remains pointedly silent.\nConversely, the incoming penalties and regulations should be interpreted as a signal that the big three exchanges will soon be allowed to resume bitcoin withdrawal, though at a cost. Still this negative portrayal of bitcoin trading shows that, at least in the short run, bitcoin in China will have difficulty gaining legal tender status as a payment tool, as opposed to the acceptance that it is seeing in Japan.\nThe logic behind this stance seems natural considering that the PBOC\u2019s own version of digital currency is already around the corner; Caixin announced in January that it had successfully completed a demo. \nIn China, blockchain technology itself is enjoying its spring. People\u2019s Daily, the Chinese state-run media, speaks highly of it. China\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan national strategy includes it. Local governments support it.\nBitcoin, however, is facing a trial. The most likely result will be that bitcoin itself will remain the same as virtual goods. As for bitcoin trading, all the stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering regulations point to one strategic bottom line: speculation of bitcoin must not result in any social or financial instability in China.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 10}

Initial blockchain protocols included in the ecosystem and supported by WanCloud\u2019s infrastructure of developers and consultants are\u00a0 BlockApps, Factom and Stellar.\nPart of Wanxiang\u2019s stated goal is to drive the advancement of China\u2019s blockchain ecosystem of developers, startups and enterprises. Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, WanCloud CTO Haifeng Xi described WanCloud as \u201cnot just a technical platform; it\u2019s an open innovation platform. WanCloud is essentially a bridge between [the] global blockchain development community and China. We aim to connect the world to the Chinese developer community, Chinese startups and traditional Chinese businesses.\u201d\nWanCloud is unique as an ecosystem in that it allows users to work with open-source blockchains more easily and in one place. Unlike traditional Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) providers that have private networks or build on top of one public chain, WanCloud plans to continually introduce the most useful open-source platforms into the WanCloud ecosystem. \nTom Tao, vice president at Wanxiang Blockchain Corporation and head of WanCloud, told Bitcoin Magazine that he hoped to \u201cbring as many fabrics as possible into the Chinese community and to drive interaction and even inter-chain collaboration, improving application level innovation for each participating protocol.\u201d\nDavid Johnston, chairman of Factom, and Jed McCaleb, CEO of Stellar, spoke with Bitcoin Magazine about why they chose to be a part of WanCloud and how it aligns with their respective companies\u2019 goals.\n\u201cWanCloud platform is acting as a bridge between the advanced tech provided by U.S. entities and the huge market of potential users in China,\u201d said Johnston, \u201cproviding them a more transparent and secure use case set in important areas like data management and auditing where Factom has core competencies as a platform.\u201d\nZeen Zhang, CEO of Factom China, added, \u201cThis partnership is important for Factom China because it will make it easier for our product to reach and serve the needs of the end users in China. WanCloud is really adding value, helping us localize the platform for enterprise users and the large community of developers in China.\u201d\nFresh off the launch of its global payments platform Lightyear, McCaleb spoke with Bitcoin Magazine about WanCloud\u2019s benefits for Stellar\u2019s development. \n\u201cIts an exciting development that makes it much easier for people to integrate with Stellar and will enable more experimentation ... China is obviously a huge market and almost every partner that we talk to in the world asks us how they can get money either in or out of China.\u201d\nChainbase Accelerator\u2019s New Cohort\nIn addition to the launch of WanCloud, Wanxiang announced the opening of the second cohort of its Chainbase Accelerator to startups, in coordination with ICOAGE, an Initial Crypto-Token Offering platform based in Shanghai and headed by James Gong, a leading blockchain intellectual and consultant in China and CEO of ChainB. Projects accepted into Chainbase Accelerator will have the opportunity to receive technical support and consulting from WanCloud architects.\nYu Cheng, a partner at Chainbase Accelerator as well as the chief product officer at WanCloud, spoke with Bitcoin Magazine about Chainbase Accelerator and said that the first cohort was \u201cmade up of experts from traditional industries and they saw blockchain [technology] as a way to solve for problems in their industries. We are looking to bring in businesses whose applications are suited for the distributed nature of blockchain tech.\u201d Cheng has coined the term \u201cdistributed commercial value\u201d in China to refer to new capabilities that blockchain tech enables.\nWanCloud joins a burgeoning group of blockchain subsidiaries for Wanxiang Group under Wanxiang Blockchain Corporation, including consulting and research interests Wanxiang Blockchain Business Innovation Consulting and Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, as well as Chainbase Accelerator and VC arm Fenbushi Capital.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 15}

The motivation for this stems from concerns about potential Israeli interference, Azzam Shawwa, Governor of the Palestinian Monetary Authority (PMA), told the news agency Reuters.\nPalestinians have no sovereign currency of their own and use a combination of different currencies, including the euro, the dollar, the Jordanian dinar and the Israeli shekel, to conduct their daily financial transactions. \nDue to the lack of a sovereign currency, Palestinian officials have little control over money supply and inflation. This is why the Palestinian Monetary Authority wants to introduce a bitcoin-like digital currency as the territory's new legal tender, which will be called \u201cthe Palestinian Pound,\u201d according to Shawwa. \nIt is the Palestinian Monetary Authority's goal to become a fully-fledged and internationally recognized central bank for an independent Palestine. However, it is still unclear how a digital sovereign currency for Palestinians would sit with the 1994 Paris Protocol agreement. The protocol agreement gives the Palestinian Monetary Authority the functions of a central bank; however, it has not granted the institutions the right to issue its own currency. The Paris protocol recommends the use of the shekel in the region and, thereby, effectively provides Israel with a veto over the establishment of a Palestinian currency.\nA sovereign digital currency, though, would make sense for Palestine. Not only would it allow the PMA to have more control over the country\u2019s money supply and inflation, but it would also circumvent the practical challenges of delivering hard currency into the country as the PMA has no money-printing facilities. \n\"If we print currency, to get it into the country you would always need clearance from the Israelis and that could be an obstacle. So that is why we don't want to go into it,\" Shawwa explained to Reuters. \u00a0\nWhile the digital Palestinian pound is planned to be issued within the next five years, this will be no easy task for Palestinian authorities, given that the Palestinian Monetary Authority has been trying for over a decade to become an internationally recognized central bank. \nAnother option for the Palestinian monetary situation would be to keep the current status quo of the four above-mentioned currencies in use or to officially recognize one of the these currencies as the territory\u2019s legal tender. However, a digital sovereign currency would be the preferred choice for Palestine, according to Shawwa.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 15}

These concerns apply directly to the many private users of Bitcoin that are worried their privacy is under assault.\nFor this purpose, users are turning to a variety of solutions. Some are turning to mixers such as the TumbleBit tumbler, a feature recently added to the still-developing Breeze Wallet. Others may be interested in using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service to further cement their security and augment anonymity.\nVPNs serve a unique purpose in the world of Bitcoin. Traditionally, businesses used them to connect remote users to a similar network, but lately they\u2019ve been increasingly used to encrypt network connections, mask IP addresses, access geographically restricted content and prevent hacking over public WiFi (and Bitcoin theft by extension).\nAlternatives such as Tor don\u2019t effectively work beyond the Tor browser. Free proxies lack the speed, reliability and advanced encryption that a VPN offers.\nWhat a VPN Is\nWith all of that said, not everyone is familiar with what a VPN does. In short, a VPN is a service with multiple remotely located servers that subscribers connect to. Because these servers act as hosts for multiple users, connection requests sent to each server are difficult to associate with the source. Additionally, having access to multiple servers allows you to diversify where you connect from.\nIt also provides many different IP addresses which can be used to circumvent geo-blocking. In doing so, users encrypt their internet traffic, block \u201csniffing\u201d attempts by hackers and prevent data tampering on the backend.\nAs noted above, VPNs are paid subscription services. While some free services exist, their quality is woefully inadequate compared to paid versions and they should be avoided by anyone seriously interested in security. Problems occur specifically with the level of encryption (unpaid VPNs rarely use 256-bit protection) and with bandwidth, specifically pertaining to slowdown and reliability.\nWhat a VPN Isn\u2019t\nJust as Virtual Private Networks do many different things, there are some things they don\u2019t. For instance, while VPNs do prevent data from being directly injected into your connection, they don\u2019t remove infected files, nor can they stop you from downloading them. Other tools \u2014 antivirus software for instance \u2014 should always be used in tandem.\nHence, a good VPN is not going to be a free service; the monthly fees go toward maintaining high-quality servers, offering valuable support and providing the sophisticated encryption needed to prevent intrusion.\nFinally, VPNs cannot prevent transactions from showing up on the blockchain. Using one will make it harder to associate transactions with your original IP address, but under no circumstances should you assume absolute anonymity.\nWhy Do I Need One?\nDeciding whether you need a VPN depends on what you intend to use it for. A person that deals with regular Bitcoin transactions and isn\u2019t especially interested in being publicly tracked gains at least a little extra privacy by doing so behind a VPN.\nYet the real benefit comes in the realm of public access. We\u2019ve all seen the jokes about civilization virtually depending on free WiFi: nearly every restaurant, caf\u00e9, and even some parks offer WiFi connections. Most of them share the same security vulnerabilities. Specifically, open connections allow hackers to use \u201csniffing\u201d programs to identify other users connecting to the service and to intercept their unsecure connections. This is the ideal point for cybercriminals to insert malware or simply to record data sent and received. \nThe only real way to be safe on these networks is with the encrypted connection VPNs offer. That goes double for accessing your Bitcoin wallet in public. If a hacker gains access to your wallet ID codes because of a compromised network, the next step is acquiring your public code, which isn\u2019t all that difficult for an experienced user.\nYou may also want to note just how much private information we store on our devices. Most of us use our phones and tablets to access email, banking information and even work files. Leaving this information wide open to criminals is a major risk few of us can afford.\nAdditionally, the continued growth in the digital currency market just makes stealing bitcoins that much more appealing to criminals, particularly when most private users have little or no security measures installed on their devices.\nSo Which Is the Best?\nChoosing the right VPN in a hugely saturated market isn\u2019t always easy, but there are a few things to consider before you do. Take note of what country the VPN company resides in; Countries such as the United States or member nations of the EU typically make poor choices as they have laws that allow authorities to demand access to records.\nSpeaking of which, avoid VPNs that keep logs of user activity. As the entire point of using a VPN is to improve privacy, it runs counter to your goals if your provider is logging your activities. That goes double for countries that willingly submit their records to the government.\nPerformance and support are also worth noting, as some VPNs can slow down your connection or be unavailable. Choosing a service with good support ensures you won\u2019t run into any trouble setting things up or troubleshooting problems that arise.\nAdditional reading about high-quality VPNs can be found in this article by Secure Thoughts. If you\u2019re still undecided, just know that the better VPNs usually offer trial periods of anywhere between a week to a full month, giving you adequate time to determine whether or not their service meets your needs.\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Faith Macanas.

At the core, the question comes down to this: Is Bitcoin a \u201cstore of value\u201d (i.e., digital gold) or a \u201ccurrency\u201d (i.e., digital cash)? That determination informs the decision about bigger blocks vs. smaller blocks. \u00a0\nBigger blocks contain more data, which yields smaller transaction fees and thus are more conducive to small payments, thus facilitating the use of Bitcoin as cash, relevant for any payments. \nOn the other hand, smaller blocks have less data contained within them, so space is at a premium and you pay a higher transaction fee to be included. As a result, it starts to make sense only for much larger transaction sizes. The bottom line is if you are transferring $10,000 worth of value, you\u2019re fine with a $1.50 fee, but the same fee added onto a $3 cup of coffee seems a bit crazy.\nIf you are of the opinion that Bitcoin\u2019s value rests primarily in its usefulness as an everyday currency \u2014 or digital cash \u2014 then you probably want a system that will have the lowest possible fees to move your funds around. \nIf you are of the opinion that Bitcoin\u2019s value is more like that of gold \u2014 a long-term store of value \u2014 and aren\u2019t concerned about the rising fees, then changes to the protocol that will increase the block size right way are probably lower on the priority list for you. \nThe ongoing debate has ebbed and flowed and gotten nasty at times, with no resolution in sight. At least, no Bitcoin community\u2013driven resolution. \u00a0\nYet while the community has focused on the argument, the market has gotten tired of waiting.\nIn effect, the decision has already been made and the market has spoken.\nThe market seems to have acknowledged and accepted the reality that it\u2019s more expensive to move value around (higher fees) and combined that with a few other facts to reach the conclusion that Bitcoin\u2019s true value is as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d\nAfter all, Bitcoin has\nthe most robust and proven network,the most understood network (only 21 million coins will ever be mined) andgrowing global acceptance of Bitcoin as a way to protect assets for people in countries with weak economies. \nThe market realizes that the safety and security of Bitcoin and the associated higher fees mean that Bitcoin is best suited to be a \u201cstore of value,\u201d that is, \u201cdigital gold.\u201d \nThe transaction sizes show that people are comfortable paying higher fees to move larger amounts of money. For micropayments, it seems as if the jury is still out as to which currency will reign supreme. Whether it\u2019s pure speculation or not as it relates to altcoins, the supreme use case for Bitcoin is, as Jimmy Song wrote, as store of value. \nIn this story of Bitcoin\u2019s market dominance decline lies a marketing lesson that any organization, decentralized or otherwise, would do well to heed. \nBitcoin Is Losing Crypto-Market Share and Growth Is Slowing\nLet\u2019s look at what has happened since the beginning of the year, as of the time of this writing. \nYes, Bitcoin is on a tremendous upward swing of over 80 percent since January 1 (as of this writing). There\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s still valuable as an asset. I think it is here for the long haul. No \u201cBitcoin is dead\u201d pronouncements from me. \nBut the other cryptocurrencies are on a bigger upward swing: Ethereum is up over 800 percent; Dash is up over 800 percent; Litecoin is up nearly 700 percent. And there are others. \nAs a result, Bitcoin\u2019s share of all cryptocurrencies has fallen from 87 percent at the beginning of the year to just over 50 percent. \nMeanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has grown in market cap from $17.6 billion to $52.6 billion. Of the $35 billion in new investments, $22.7 billion (64.89 percent) is non-Bitcoin. In other words, of the total market growth since January, two out of every three dollars invested in the cryptocurrency markets have gone into tokens not named Bitcoin. \nThe exact numbers change all the time, of course, but momentum for alternatives seems to be increasing, not decreasing. \nKey Players Are Migrating or Diversifying\nEarlier this month, Coinbase introduced support for Litecoin. The market-leading exchange is sending a clear message. There\u2019s appetite for a crypto-token that is architected as digital cash. Litecoin is also important to the community because of the activation of SegWit and potentially Lightning, as a proving ground for these technologies and where innovation is happening faster. \nSay what you will about ICOs, but the fact is that many of them happen on Ethereum. For example, one notable project, Storj, recently announced that they are moving to the Ethereum blockchain, not only because of its active developer ecosystem, but because transaction fees on the BItcoin blockchain are too high.\nIn short, leaders within their respective verticals are saying the same thing: there\u2019s real life outside of Bitcoin.\nHistorical Precedents\nWhere else has a first-mover gained a sizable market advantage only to have it dissipate in the face of its own indecisiveness? \nTwo examples that immediately come to mind are Nokia and TiVo. \nIn 1997, Nokia had fully half of the global phone market. Today, it has virtually disappeared in most of the developed world, and has plummeted from 46 percent to 34 percent in Africa \u2014 and most of those owners don\u2019t intend to get a new one. \nSimilarly, TiVo basically pioneered the concept of the DVR. It achieved the vaunted \u201cverb\u201d status, as in, \u201cI\u2019ll TiVo it.\u201d At its height, the stock was trading at $124.75. In 2016, the company was acquired for $18 per share.\nSo what happened? How and why did these market leaders falter? \nAs one researcher put it, TiVo \u201clost sight of the customer,\u201d and as another put it, Nokia lost sight of the market (which is essentially the same thing). In both cases, it led to long periods of indecision. \nOlli-Pekka Kallasvuo, former CEO of Nokia, said that \u201cnowhere in business history has a competitive environment changed so much as it did with the converging of several industries \u2014 to the point that no-one knows what to call the industry anymore. Mobile telephony converged with the mobile computer, the internet industry, the media industry and the applications industry \u2014 to mention a few \u2026 and today they\u2019re all rolled into one.\u201d \nIt sure feels as if the decentralization industry is approaching warp speed. Understanding the changing dynamics of the market and responding quickly to them becomes non-negotiable. \nClayton Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor, writes in his book \u201cCompeting Against Luck\u201d that the single most important question you can ask to sustain innovation is: \u201cWhat job did you hire that product to do?\u201d\nIf you can get to that, you can build and evolve a product or service that has staying power. \nWhat Can Be Learned?\nIt\u2019s easy in the thrill of new technology to get caught up in the potential of it. Yet, ultimately, if you are trying to create something of true and enduring value, you need to be crystal-clear on a few things:\n1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WHO exactly is your customer?\n2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WHAT did they hire your product to do? \nWhen Christensen says \u201chire,\u201d it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u201cpay.\u201d It can mean \u201cuse,\u201d or \u201cpay attention to,\u201d or \u201cvote.\u201d Still, having a really deep understanding of the kind of person you are serving and WHY they think they need your product (not why you think they need your product) are genesis block-level elements of your marketing efforts. \nNot taking the time (it need not be a lot) to answer these fundamental questions can put your project at risk. \u00a0\nWe\u2019ve seen huge capital outlays in response to debt crises in countries like Greece, Argentina and Turkey. In the face of a scandal or bad news, there are sell-offs in the stock market. In a decentralized world, the movement of capital away from a project can occur even faster. \nAs TiVo and Nokia learned, you can\u2019t sit around and wait. The market changes on you too quickly.\nThe Road Ahead\nBitcoin has held the \u201ctop dog\u201d spot for a long time and for many obvious reasons (strength of network, quality of developers, peer review process, brand recognition, etc.). It stands to be a key player for a long time in the crypto-universe. \nYet, the intensity of the fight in the Bitcoin scaling debate shows us that the question of \u201cwhat did you hire this product for?\u201d has two wide and varied answers. \nThe inability to satisfactorily answer these key questions has led to paralysis, which gives market competitors and alternatives a chance to differentiate and take market share. \nAnd it risks allowing the market to define Bitcoin instead of Bitcoin defining itself. \nThis op-ed is a guest post by Jeremy Epstein.

Cryptocurrency should not be regulated. Cryptocurrency can\u2019t be regulated. These are all common refrains emanating from the media these days. Now lawmakers across the United States and around the world are at a crossroads as to what is next in terms of this regulatory space.\nBitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency present a monumental challenge for legislators, requiring a broad understanding of blockchain technology, especially in terms of its impact on tech innovation. Amid assertions that the U.S. is falling behind in terms of Bitcoin regulation, it could be argued that the regulatory picture is becoming clearer in 2017. \nBitcoin Magazine asked Pawel Kuskowski, CEO and co-founder of Coinfirm, and Joe Ciccolo, \u00a0president of the Illinois-based Bitcoin compliance firm BitAML, to offer some commentary about the regulatory activity taking place in five U.S. states \u2014 Washington, Illinois, Hawaii, California and Florida \u2014 and what the regulatory landscape may look like in the days ahead. \nWashington \nLegislators in Washington state are building momentum around new rules for businesses offering digital currency services. Senate Bill 5013 provides a definition of virtual currency along with disclosure requirements of certain information to consumers. It also would require online currency exchanges within that state to maintain a surety bond. Finally, it offers definitional and clarifying changes for how money transmitters and currency exchangers are regulated under the Uniform Money Services Act.\nAt the time of this writing, this bill, which was introduced in January, had passed both chambers of the state\u2019s legislature, clearing it to be sent to Governor Jay Inslee for signature. While there is no clear indication as to Governor Inslee\u2019s intentions, broad support of the bill seems to suggest that it may pass. \nThere has already been a bit of fallout, however, as some cryptocurrency-centric startups are now thinking twice about operating in the state, with several firms having pulled out in the past year, noting the increasingly challenging regulatory environment. These include digital currency exchanges Bitfinex, Bitstamp and Poloniex, the latter of which has exited Washington. \n\u201cThe State of Washington also appears to have applied a relatively heavy cybersecurity component, including broad and sweeping audits of data and other systems,\u201d says Ciccolo. \u201cCybersecurity is a hot-button issue that continues to remain in the headlines. Bitcoin companies are wary of a regulatory interpretation of cybersecurity fitness, especially given the nascent stage of Bitcoin and the ongoing knowledge gap as it pertains to the crypto space. For some national players, it seemed the obvious and safe choice was to simply exit the state altogether.\u201d \nIllinois \u00a0\nIn November of 2016, Secretary Bryan A. Schneider of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) announced a new initiative with implications for cryptocurrencies in that state. This \u201cDigital Currency Regulatory Guidance\u201d is Illinois\u2019s attempt to provide regulatory clarity on digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and Zcash. The proposed guidance provides IDFPR\u2019s interpretation of Illinois\u2019s Transmitters of Money Act (TOMA) related to various activities tied to digital currencies.\nSays Ciccolo: \u201cThe IDFPR and Secretary Schneider continue to deliver on the state\u2019s promise of encouraging and supporting innovation in FinTech, Bitcoin and blockchain [technology]. What we\u2019re doing in Illinois is quite possibly unprecedented in the area of financial regulation. Our state regulators are listening and thoughtfully engaging with industry while considering the impact of any laws and regulations. I\u2019m very optimistic about the continued growth of financial innovation in the Land of Lincoln, and Chicago as a center for the new era of financial services.\u201d\nHawaii \nIn a highly publicized move, prominent Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange Coinbase announced that it was forced to cease supporting customers in the State of Hawaii due to what it called \u201cimpractical\u201d and \u201cuntenable\u201d regulatory policies surrounding Bitcoin in that state. In September of 2016, Coinbase was first notified of a policy that demanded that they and any other other cryptocurrency operators hold case reserves equivalent to the values being held for customers. \nThis development came as Hawaii was exploring a bill that would establish a working group for examining the potential role of digital currencies and blockchain technology in advancing tourism in that state. According to the bill\u2019s text contained in House Bill 1481: \u201cDigital currencies such as bitcoin have broad benefits for Hawaii. A large portion of Hawaii\u2019s tourism market comes from Asia where the use of bitcoin as a virtual currency is expanding.\u201d \nLeaders at Coinbase said they were \u201cheartened\u201d that the bill had been introduced and that they would look forward to working with regulators. In the meantime, Ciccolo remarked: \u201cGiven its commitment to compliance and strong resources, the exit of Coinbase suggests few if any stand a chance in the Aloha State. Indeed, the case reserve requirement is overly burdensome and quite frankly utterly impractical. Since Coinbase holds a BitLicense, could it be said that Hawaii is more inhospitable to Bitcoin than New York? Let\u2019s hope not.\u201d\nCalifornia \nCalifornia\u2019s Assembly Bill 1123, a version of New York\u2019s infamous BitLicense, has been proposed. It reads:\n\u201cThis bill would enact the Virtual Currency Act. The bill would prohibit a person from engaging in any virtual currency business, as defined, in this state unless the person is licensed by the Commissioner of Business Oversight or is exempt from the licensure requirement, as provided.\u201d\nSays Kuskowski, CEO and co-founder of Coinfirm:\n\u201cIn relation to this particular proposed bill in California, any bill with strong similarities to New York\u2019s BitLicense is obviously not the direction to go in, as we saw the effects of that particular regulation result in New York\u2019s loss of prominence as a crypto hub. But with California\u2019s unique position as the technology innovation and startup capital of the world, this would have an even more catastrophic effect than the N.Y. version.\u201d\nKuskowski goes on to say that the costly fees and bureaucratic administration associated with this legislation would likely hinder innovators and startups from applying or even operating in the state. Moreover, he says it would provide another segmented regulatory structure that limits the national and global growth of companies operating in the space. \nIf there is any place in the world where this could have the largest negative effect it would be California.\nFlorida \nFlorida House Bill 1379 recently passed, clarifying what virtual currency is and prohibiting its use in laundering criminal proceeds. The term \u201cvirtual currency\u201d was added to the definition of \u201cmonetary instruments\u201d under Florida\u2019s Money Laundering Act. The legislation is currently with Florida\u2019s governor and is expected to be signed soon. Ever since a Miami judge dismissed a criminal case involving Bitcoin, policymakers have been intent on establishing guidelines to curb cryptocurrency use. \nSays Kuskowski: \u201cIn relation to what\u2019s been going on in Florida, a lot of regulators, especially local ones, tend to be more in the crowd profiled earlier that catches headlines, and they go a bit far. But there needs to be a balanced approach from the other side as well. People need to realize that a clear regulatory environment allows companies and creators in the space to make concrete strategic decisions that they [otherwise] can\u2019t when the regulatory environment isn\u2019t clear; it just has to be done properly. Once there is a clear regulation in place, businesses have the confidence to make certain strategic decisions and further grow.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 16}

RBS\u2019s Emerald platform, which was built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, has already been tested in the Dublin-based startup hub Dogpatch Labs, where participating banks have been conducting dummy payments among themselves to test the blockchain-based system for performance, stability and accuracy. The platform is able to acknowledge payments in less than 10 seconds while processing large transaction volumes. \nThe distributed ledger technology pioneered by Bitcoin allows transactions to be recorded and shared with permissioned members on a distributed ledger, enabling payments to be processed in a more secure and efficient manner. \n\u201c[The blockchain is] essentially a software that provides a way of recording transactions in a trustworthy way. It has the potential to disrupt multiple industries for the benefit of customers, and we\u2019re determined to investigate how we can harness this for the financial sector,\u201d said Ulster Bank\u2019s chief administrative officer, Ciar\u00e1n Coyle. \u00a0\n\u201cWhen we saw that RBS had that capability, we decided to use the platform in the Republic. We looked at how we could prove it at an industry level and looked at doing collaboration at an industry level,\u201d he added. \nFor RBS\u2019s Head of Innovation Engineering Richard Crook, it \u201cmade sense\u201d for RBS\u2019s Irish subsidiary, Ulster Bank, to adopt its Emerald payment system for the collaborative industry-wide payment network trial. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to support that and further prove that blockchain [technology] can be used to better serve customers,\u201d Crook added.\nDavid Dalton, consulting partner and financial services industry leader at Deloitte Ireland, stated that the pilot project would leverage the company\u2019s blockchain lab in Dublin, and added: \u201cWe believe blockchain adoption will happen more quickly than anticipated and without a proactive and well-adopted strategy, banks and insurers risk being locked out of potential innovations enabled by this technology.\u201d\nNo specific timeframe has been set for when the new payment system could be implemented in the Irish financial system, and there is no guarantee that it will. However, Project GreenPay is another clear signal that banks across the world are embracing blockchain technology to improve the efficiency and security of their services.

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nMuch of the world has now heard about Bitcoin due to the global WanaCrypt0r 2.0 ransomware, which should continue spreading over the course of next week. Optics for Bitcoin aren\u2019t great in situations like this because it furthers the notion that Bitcoin is used for nefarious means. You can follow a live feed of the incoming transactions from this twitter bot. However, the silver lining is that many people who did not know what Bitcoin is or how to use it before the attack certainly do now.\nWorst-case scenario for Bitcoin here would be a government crackdown on its use and distribution, which, although a low probability, is probably not a non-zero possibility considering the current administration. This would create a large down day in the market similar to when Silk Road was shut down, Mt. Gox was found to be insolvent and Bitfinex was hacked. Of course, Bitcoin the protocol would be unaffected, so the price is likely to bounce back rather quickly. \nThe block size and scalability debate trickles on with no current end or resolution in sight. I wouldn\u2019t really expect a push out of the SegWit camp until October or November, when the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is set to be tabled for the time being. The number of unconfirmed transactions continues to rise on an upward trend, all the while miners who support Bitcoin Unlimited are mining empty or non-full blocks. \n\nThe COIN ETF comment period closed yesterday, which isn\u2019t to say there will be any type of decision on the SEC\u2019s part. This will likely be a non-event for the market considering the ETF itself will remain in limbo until further notice. \nTotal cryptocurrency market capitalization broke a new all-time high (ATH) of $55 billionearlier this week, while Bitcoin dropped just shy of 50 percent of that total.\n\n\nSome may view this as Bitcoin losing its impact and success, which can be partially attributed to the block size and scalability in-fighting. Others, like myself, view this shift as a massive altcoin bubble. Hockey stick parabolic curves on a chart like that end with large selloff candles. There is also only one Bitcoin, with a fixed supply, competing against an infinite number of altcoins, many with pre-mined or infinite supply as well. \nBecause of the correction late in the week, the weekly candle was threatening a bearish close with a wick longer than the candle body, but the heavy buying on Sunday prevented the bearish close.\n\nThis weekly close alone suggests continuation over reversal or sideways movement in price. Since the beginning of the trend, duration of consolidation between large upward moves has decreased. This will eventually lead to a parabolic, euphoric, blowoff top with a massive candle wick. Until then, expect more of the same. A small correction this week would just mean an even greater chance for extended continuation. \nBitcoin did make a new high this week of $1,868.50, according to index, and is currently drawing an \u201cM for murder\u201d double top. This likely represents consolidation to a further move upward and not exhaustion of trend. \n\nThis is the only chart I\u2019m really focused on at the moment. There are plenty of potential patterns, such as head and shoulders or Adam and Eve, harmonics, and horizontal support levels here, but all that really matters is the larger consolidation pattern. \nThis may also represent a flag/pennant, which is another sign of bullish continuation.\n\n\nA more ominous double top for a bull market would have similar price structure to the pattern that formed during the ATH of 2013.\n\nAs discussed above, a serious threat of reversal shows large candle wicks on high timeframes, which is not currently the case with price structure.\nSummary\nMost of the world is now aware of Bitcoin due to the WanaCrypt0r 2.0 ransomware.The block size and scalability debate continues with large transaction backlogs in an upward trend. Based on market capitalization, Bitcoin is currently hovering around 50 percent of the total.

{"title": "Four Quick Questions and Answers About Ransomware and Bitcoin", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/four-quick-questions-and-answers-about-ransomware-and-bitcoin/", "birthday": "May 16, 2017  4:48 PM EST", "date": "2017-05-16 21:48:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin got caught in another media storm this week, though only in a supporting role this time around. The ongoing ransomware attack by the name of \u201cWannaCry,\u201d sometimes also referred to as \u201cWannaCrypt0r,\u201d \u201cWcry,\u201d \u201cWanaCry,\u201d \u201cWannaCrypt\u201d or \u201cWana Decrypt0r,\u201d infected over 230,000 computers in over 150 countries over the past couple of days, and demands that victims pay a ransom in the cryptocurrency.\nSo what is ransomware, and what does Bitcoin have to do with all of this?\nWhat Is Ransomware?\nRansomware is a type of computer virus that encrypts data with a secret key. Only if a payment is made, typically in bitcoin, is the decryption key provided so victims can regain access to their data \u2014 or at least that\u2019s the promise. An infected computer is quite literally held ransom, for actual money: bitcoin.\nUnfortunately, ransomware is quickly growing in scope, and fast turning into a booming business for cybercriminals. In 2015, some estimated $24 million was paid to unlock computers, according to the FBI; in 2016, it hit a dazzling $1 billion. And that\u2019s only expected to get worse this year.\nWannaCry, which started last Friday, is the biggest ransomware attack the world has seen so far. This is mostly because WannaCry is not only ransomware, but also a \u201cworm.\u201d This worm uses an exploit developed by the NSA that abuses a weakness in older Windows PCs, which lets it forward itself to more and more computers: over 230,000 of them at the time of writing.\nWannaCry also affected several notable targets over the past week, including Spanish phone provider Telef\u00f3nica, parts of Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS), U.S. delivery service FedEx, German railways Deutsche Bahn, LATAM Airlines and more.\nHow Successful Is Ransomware?\nRansomware attacks seem to be relatively successful in general. According to research by cybersecurity firm Trustlook, for example, over one in three victims of ransomware pay up. And a survey by IBM even showed that 70 percent of businesses infected with ransomware paid the ransom.\nWannaCry, however, has not been nearly as successful \u2014 or at least not yet. At the time of writing, some 40 bitcoins have been paid to the three Bitcoin addresses associated with WannaCry. At an exchange rate of $1,700, that adds up to about $68,000 in total gains for the attackers. This is perhaps a significant amount in itself, but still modest when taking into account that well over 200,000 computers have been affected, and the ransom demanded is between $300 and $600.\nThe damage has probably been contained, to a large extent, because it didn\u2019t take long for a security researcher who blogs as \u201cMalwareTech\u201d to find an effective kill switch. He simply registered a website that was mentioned in the code of WannaCry, which disabled at least the initial version of the ransomware.\nAdditionally, WannaCry gave its victims a week to pay up \u2014 though the price to unlock the encrypted data does double from $300 to $600 after four days. Given that a week hasn\u2019t passed since the first reports of infections, it\u2019s possible there will be another surge of payments over the next week.\nWhy Does Ransomware Use Bitcoin?\nRansomware does not technically require bitcoin. Indeed, there are known cases of ransomware that existed decades before Bitcoin was even invented. \nHowever, bitcoin (and similar cryptocurrencies) can make ransomware much more effective. This is mostly because Bitcoin transactions are instant, reliable, relatively anonymous, easy to verify, and irreversible. Additionally, Bitcoin payments can potentially be made programmable, so a payment automatically sends a decryption key to a victim once a payment is made \u2014 though WannaCry did not utilize this possibility.\nAt the same time, however, the Bitcoin blockchain is also completely transparent. This is why it\u2019s possible to trace exactly how much has been paid to WannaCry. It also means that it may not be very easy for the attackers to convert their bitcoins into fiat currency, or even spend them. If they ever do try to move the funds without taking appropriate precautions, they could get caught. Instead they\u2019ll have to first mix and scramble their coins, which is possible but not necessarily easy to do.\nWhat Can You Do About Ransomware?\nThe main source of the ransomware problem is not so much Bitcoin, it\u2019s insecure computers. The fact that any malware can nest itself into computers is a problem in itself. Even without ransomware, it means that files can be stolen, edited or otherwise corrupted.\nThe solution, therefore, is as simple as it is boring: make sure your operating system is up to date and secure. WannaCry in particular was able to affect so many computers because they were running older versions of Windows. Upgraded computers are no longer vulnerable.\nAdditionally, you want to make sure to never click suspicious links in emails you receive. WannaCry initially spread itself through such links.\nFurthermore, you should make sure to back up your data regularly. If you have your data backed up, you should be able to simply update your computer and restore your files without having to pay anything.\nAnd last but not least, it is not recommended that you pay the ransom. For one, you never know for sure that paying up will actually solve your problem; the attacker could simply lie or perhaps even encrypt your data again.

In Norway, more and more individuals are now also turning their eyes toward digital currencies, Hern\u00e6s stated. \nNot all banks in Norway share Skandiabanken\u2019s enthusiasm for offering its users access to bitcoin as a new investment class. Norway\u2019s largest bank, DNB, closed the bank account of Norges Bitcoinforening, Norway\u2019s Bitcoin association, in September 2016, citing concerns that the association\u2019s funds may have a connection with money laundering and terrorist financing.\nHern\u00e6s acknowledges DNB\u2019s concern in regard to the country\u2019s strict anti-money laundering regulations that require a stringent assessment of each banking client. However, he also said, \u201cWe recognize that this is something people want to put their money in. When we think it is right to look at new solutions we can offer, we think it is a better approach than categorically thinking that this is scary.\u201d\nThe head of Norway\u2019s Bitcoin association, Stephan Nilsson, is pleased about Skandiabanken\u2019s new Bitcoin service: \u201cThis is very positive. These are the signals we have been waiting for from the Norwegian banking industry.\u201d\nSkandiabanken joins the ranks of the very few banks in Europe that are embracing Bitcoin.

{"title": "Bitmain May Be Infringing on the AsicBoost Patent After All", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitmain-may-be-infringing-asicboost-patent-after-all/", "birthday": "May 18, 2017  8:08 PM EST", "date": "2017-05-19 01:08:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe AsicBoost controversy has added another chapter to its book.\nYesterday, law firm Getech Law published an open letter, which was subsequently confirmed to be legitimate by Timo Hanke, the initial submitter of the AsicBoost patent application. In the open letter, the law firm states that several chip producers and sellers are infringing on the intellectual property derived from the pending AsicBoost patent. As such, these companies should \u201ccease production and sales activities of any products in connection to the pending patent application.\u201d\nWhile the letter does not state it explicitly, and Getech Law preferred not to name specific companies when asked by Bitcoin Magazine, the open letter seems to refer to recent revelations of Bitmain\u2019s implementation of AsicBoost in their specialized Bitcoin mining (ASIC) chips. Indeed, if the letter\u2019s claims hold up, Bitcoin\u2019s biggest mining hardware producer may be unable to sell most of their hardware for the time being.\nOtherwise, as Getech Law attorney Jun Ye told Bitcoin Magazine:\nIf the potential infringements cannot be stopped by the announcement and subsequent cease-and-desist letters, we will have no choice but to seek damages in court once our pending application is issued by the USPTO and other patent offices.\nAsicBoost\nAsicBoost has had a controversial history within the Bitcoin industry so far.\nInitially patented by mathematician and former CoinTerra CTO Timo Hanke, AsicBoost is perhaps best described as a sort of \u201cshortcut\u201d that exploits a weakness in Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work algorithm. By reusing some of their work, miners can save between 10 and 30 percent of the energy costs associated with mining. This can add up to a significant increase in profits over time \u2014 perhaps in excess of over $100 million per year if no other miners use it.\nAnd it could be the case that no other miners would use it precisely because of AsicBoost\u2019s pending patent. The patent application is therefore controversial, as some believe that such a state-enforced monopoly on using technology could further centralize and skew Bitcoin\u2019s mining ecosystem. About a year ago several Bitcoin developers even proposed changing Bitcoin\u2019s mining algorithm slightly in order to make AsicBoost\u2019s technology obsolete.\nBut the AsicBoost controversy really exploded onto the scene several weeks ago, as it was discovered that covert use of AsicBoost is incompatible with Segregated Witness, the protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. Moreover, it was revealed that Bitmain had implemented the technology in its chips. This might explain why the Chinese mining giant has been opposing the upgrade so far \u2014 though the company denies this is the case.\nPatent Infringement\nNow, it seems Bitmain may not even be legally allowed to have AsicBoost implemented in its chips.\nWhile Hanke was known to have submitted a patent for AsicBoost along with RSK CEO Sergio Demian Lerner, Bitmain initially claimed to hold the patent in China. As such, the company said it shouldn\u2019t be a problem \u2014 from a legal perspective \u2014 to apply the technology at least within the Chinese jurisdiction.\nBut it now seems that Hanke claimed his worldwide priority date at the end of 2013, while Bitmain\u2019s patent application stems from 2015. And because of the International Patent System (PCT), Hanke\u2019s application should apply to China as well.\n\u201cAlthough Bitmain has also filed a patent application in China with similar features, we are confident that our patent application has an earlier priority date,\u201d Ye told Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe patent application is not Hanke\u2019s anymore. Two weeks ago, he sold the patent to Little Dragon Technology, a company based in California. According to Ye, Little Dragon Technology plans to operate in the Bitcoin industry, though it was not yet revealed how, exactly.\nEither way, neither Hanke nor Little Dragon Technology gave anyone permission to use AsicBoost. This suggests, at least according to Getech Law, that anyone using AsicBoost is infringing on Little Dragon Technology\u2019s intellectual property. And while Ye did not want to name any specific companies that may be infringing on the intellectual property \u2014 Bitmain or otherwise \u2014 he did reveal it may be more than one company.\nAs the open letter states:\n\u201cTo date, no individual or business entity has been authorized to use or sell products based on the ASICBOOST patent application, yet some bitcoin miner manufacturers have implemented various features of the pending ASICBOOST patent in their mining hardware and firmware, potentially infringing the pending ASICBOOST patent.\u201d\nConsequences\nIn the open letter published yesterday, Getech Law wrote that ASIC producers should immediately cease production and sales of AsicBoost-related products. Additionally, the letter said infringers should contact Getech Law and disclose their relevant production and sales records since 2015. And it called on people who know more about potential patent infringement to contact the law firm.\nIf ASIC producers do continue to produce or sell AsicBoost-related products, Getech Law warned that there would be subsequent legal action.\n\u201cThe open letter (announcement) is the first step to enforce my client\u2019s IP rights. We hope that the community can become aware of the potential infringement,\u201d Ye told Bitcoin Magazine. \nThe future for AsicBoost itself seems unclear, too. While debate over whether or not to disable it on a protocol level is ongoing within Bitcoin\u2019s technical community, the open letter spoke of an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d it could give to miners.\nAnd, speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Ye said:\n\u201cWe do not want to monopoly the market based on the pending patent. That is, we hope anyone who wants to use the technology can come to us such that we can negotiate reasonable license agreements for them to use the technology.\u201d\nBitmain stated that they were not available for comment at time of publication.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 19}

The answer to that question appears to be yes, according to a recently completed proof-of-concept study conducted by Peer Ledger, a Canadian blockchain company; SAFE-BioPharma Association, the organization managing the global SAFE-BioPharma digital identity management standard; and Synchronoss, a leading provider of standards-based digital identities.\nThis development is believed to have significant implications for the use of distributed electronic ledgers (i.e., blockchains) for medical, pharmaceutical and other health system applications. \nThe purpose of the study was to demonstrate that cyber identities that comply with the SAFE-BioPharma standard may, via Peer Ledger APIs, enable blockchain identities to be de-anonymized, thereby fulfilling a requirement for double-blind clinical trials, audits and responsible supply chains. Prior to the study, identities associated with distributed electronic ledgers were entirely anonymous.\n\u201cIdentity trust\u201d means that there is trust in each cyber identity, using a process that proves the individual\u2019s identity before linking it to the cyber credential. In general terms, it means that the credential can be trusted to represent the vetted identity of the individual one is doing business with but has never met face-to-face. This is critically important to the pharma/life sciences space because of several factors, including deterrence of hackers seeking valuable patient records and intellectual property, as well as compliance with regulations protecting patient data.\nThese discoveries underscore the power of blockchain technology to disrupt traditional practices for drug discovery, patient engagement and monitoring, payments and participatory healthcare delivery. Here, the technology leverages its quality as a shared, synchronized, distributed ledger of transactions, fostering security and decreasing fraud by providing a permanent record of who accessed ledgers and what activities they engaged in. \u00a0\nThe proof of concept demonstrated that SAFE-BioPharma-compliant digital identities can be tied back to the blockchain to assure trust in the identity of each person engaged in the transaction. Transactions can be anonymous until the end of a clinical study and \u201cchained back\u201d to the proven identity of the user, if needed, for regulatory or clinical purposes. Alternatively, the identities associated with each block can be known throughout the process, such as in track-and-trace applications for the medical supply chain. \nBlockchain technology\u2019s use of a group-consensus algorithm can be used to catch intentional or inadvertent double spending of an asset. For example, an accounts-receivable blockchain application can provide \u201cmultiple eyes\u201d to prevent double invoicing. Similarly, a counterfeit-catching purchasing blockchain application can prevent harmful substances and devices from entering the medical system. \nUltimately, for blockchain technology to reach its full potential in any sector, myriad systems must be interoperable. Currently, healthcare technologies rarely work in a highly synchronized way with one another, which is why pharmaceutical and other medical companies that already have powerful identity management tools are trialing a number of different blockchain-based applications. \nThus far, these apps have been unable to bridge to the systems pharma companies use to establish identity credentials for their personnel. This is the problem addressed in the proof of concept. Peer Ledger has therefore developed software that now maps a trusted identity, from the Synchronoss-implemented Verizon Universal Identity Services system to blockchain credentials.\n\u201cEvery SAFE-BioPharma-compliant identity credential accurately represents the proven identity of the person using it,\u201d explains Mollie Shields-Uehling, president and CEO of SAFE-BioPharma Association. \u201cTeaming these credentials with anonymous blockchain ledger postings enables use cases critical for overall cybersecurity across healthcare and the life sciences.\u201d \nWhen asked about future applications of all of this for healthcare, Shields-Uehling and Dawn Jutla, CEO and founder of Peer Ledger, highlighted three major areas of blockchain intersection. \nBlockchain and clinical trials: In order to co-partner in the discovery of cures, patients may give pharmaceutical companies direct access to their digitized healthcare records, thus improving both data used for research and the speed of patient treatment. Britain\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer, Sir Mark Walport, has argued that the National Health Service, which provides healthcare for 65 million people, should use blockchain technology to improve such tasks as the sharing of health records.\nBlockchain and data collection: Earlier this year, IBM Watson Health announced it would work with the FDA to develop a secure, efficient and scalable exchange of health data using blockchain technology. Oncology data will be the initial focus.\nBlockchain and personalized precision medicine: Blockchain technology\u2019s cryptography will secure economical home healthcare sensor feeds. Trusted identity will be important to ensure that the right test results are associated with the right patient.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 19}

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nWith bitcoin making new all-time highs (ATHs) in price and market capitalization almost every day, the block size and scalability debate has taken a back seat over the past week. From a user perspective, unconfirmed transactions are on the rise due to a clogged and busy network. Without any changes to the Bitcoin protocol, this will not improve, especially if bitcoin continues to push higher on heavy demand.\n\nThe number of unconfirmed transactions hit an ATH of 140,000 on May 5. Although this isn\u2019t the best metric to evaluate health of the network because large numbers of spam transactions can inflate this number, it does give a user an indication of how quickly or slowly they will receive their bitcoin. To determine the optimal fee that will give your transaction a chance to be processed in a reasonable time, it\u2019s a good idea to use a wallet that will calculate this for you. Alternatively, you can reference a website. At the current rate, microtransactions are not exactly feasible due to high transaction costs.\n\nHere are some tips for what to do if your transaction gets stuck.\n\n\nPrices and premiums between the various USD exchanges have been fluctuating wildly, with GDAX and Bitfinex often leading in price.\n\nNo amendments have been made to the COIN ETF since the SEC\u2019s review of rejection, but this will be something to keep a close eye on since it could spark a media frenzy and drive price higher. GBTC, an OTC market that uses a BTC derivative available to the public, hit a new ATH of $2,000 per bitcoin yesterday, or a $200+ premium from the current spot price. We can expect this premium to shrink to $0 if the COIN ETF gets approved, as those same investors would likely move toward that market. \n\nWith prices this high, getting close to parabolic movement, it\u2019s hard to estimate targets or true resistance in price discovery mode. Even a price target of $4,000 isn\u2019t exactly impossible. The inverted head and shoulders that confirmed a few weeks ago hit its measured target of $1,575.\n\nA slightly modified pitchfork yields targets around $1,800\u20132,000, with price recently breaking the resistance diagonal rather cleanly.\n\nHeikin-Ashi candlesticks on the daily timeframe continue to show strong bullish momentum despite volume or oscillators suggesting otherwise. Typically, a Heikin-Ashi run like this will end in a blow-off top, similar to the price structure of January 4 and 5, as well as November 2015 (not shown).\n\nSummary\nUnconfirmed transactions will continue to plague Bitcoin, especially as new users and traders ramp onto the network. Stuck transactions can be avoided by using an appropriate transaction fee.The Bitfinex premium in excess of $100 at one point between exchanges continues to shrink.Most technicals are of little use with this price structure and discovery, although a large parabolic move is likely coming in the very near future.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

As recognized experts in the regulatory compliance field, the U.K.-based startup is well placed to benefit from this growing demand. \nPawel Kuskowski, Coinfirm CEO and cofounder, noted recently that RegTech is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to take advantage of the inevitable increase in rules and regulations that accompany a new field of enterprise.\nKuskowski told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cFor us, challenges include segmented regulations for cryptocurrencies or blockchain transactions on local levels. Bitlicense [is] an extreme example, but locally driven regulations create segmentation for a technology, system and industry that is organically without borders.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons we are so active with regulators and are influencing the direction of the regulatory landscape.

Scott, whose company Outlier Solutions works with digital currency and blockchain startups on anti-money laundering (AML) and regulatory compliance, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cThe complexity of regulatory requirements has been increasing for over a decade now. In step with this, compliance costs have been continuously increasing over the same period ... but this is hurting more than just firms\u2019 bottom lines.\u201d\nScott noted that, for most businesses, it is becoming impossible to conduct effective transaction monitoring or to have any real sense of the data without automation. \u201cWe often hear people say that they \u2018know their clients\u2019 \u2014 this is a common refrain in every regulated business, but regulators aren\u2019t buying it. Unless you can prove it, you\u2019re out of luck ... Fortunately, most automated tools have excellent audit trails.\u201d\nCoinfirm is most recognized for its Blockchain AML and Compliance platform, which has been used by major banks and digital currencies like Dash. Its platform uses proprietary algorithms and big data analytics to increase efficiency, reduce costs and streamline compliance to near automation.\nIt is also blockchain agnostic, meaning that it is technically adoptable for any type of blockchain whether public like Bitcoin or Dash, or private such as the blockchain solutions many large companies and institutions are developing.\nCoinfirm is also promoting its blockchain solution for the registration and verification of authenticity of any type of document, record or file. Their Document Verification Platform is currently bringing in traditional players to use public blockchains like Bitcoin or Dash but in a way that naturally fits their already existing needs and processes.\nThe challenge that RegTech encounters is obtaining accurate and timely data from a myriad of legacy systems and interpreting this data appropriately. \nScott isn\u2019t concerned about the growth of automated RegTech:\n\u201cI\u2019m occasionally asked if I am at all concerned about the cannibalization of these industries by automation, but I think that this is an absurd question. I hope that large swaths of the industry will be automated, freeing up humans to add real value rather than performing repetitive compliance tasks.

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nAs Bitcoin breaks its own all-time high (ATH) on multiple exchanges, it appears as though a rising tide raises all boats.\n\nMost important, GDAX/Coinbase, a crucial on/off ramp for digital currencies, has taken the lead in ETH/USD volume and is reporting higher ETH/USD than BTC/USD volume over the past 24 hours. \n\n\nThis is anecdotal evidence for a key metric of \u201cnew money\u201d coming into the space. Although the $4\u20135 premium remains on Bitfinex due to USD withdrawal halt, GDAX now leads in volume and holds a small premium above a few of the other exchanges as well. Poloniex and ETH/BTC volume continue to lead globally (not shown).\nEthereum hash rate also continues to push ATHs almost daily, showing strong confidence in miner support.\n\nFor weeks now, I\u2019ve been watching the slow formation of the head and shoulders bearish reversal chart pattern. The pattern convincingly formed with the appropriate and important descending volume profile. \n\nThe trick with trading these patterns is to not jump the gun. The short entry signal is always a break of the horizontal support on volume. That never happened. Instead, price held above the 200 EMA and refused a bearish 50/200 EMA cross as well. When reversal patterns form and do not play out as expected, that is generally considered to be a strong continuation sign. \nIt\u2019s also possible that this was simply a bullish continuation pennant all along, with a measured move target of ~$115 (0.088).\n\nGoing forward, we should watch for price to test previous local highs and push for the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, yielding a target of ~$115 (0.0873). \n\nThere is also a high probability that a higher high in price will not yield a higher high on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator. Although this result is days or a few weeks away at this point, watching out for this now will prevent you from entering a trade based on emotions. Sure, price can go parabolic at any time and break the rules of divergences, but should a divergence form, it suggests continuation is far less likely than reversal. We will also want to be watching volume. If volume does not break previous local highs, it adds to the bearish divergence confluence, all of which would suggest bullish momentum is waning. \nSummary\nAs Bitcoin breaks ATHs, it\u2019s likely that any digital currency on associated on-ramps increases as well, simply by association.Bitfinex ETH/USD premium continues and should continue until USD withdrawals resume, if ever. Although chart patterns and indicators were leaning bullish, price did not break down and is now projecting a target of ~$115. Watch for the new Ethereum ATH to occur and create a bearish divergence with a swift pullback in price. \nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

To combat this phenomenon, Polish blockchain startup Userfeeds plans to tokenize news discovery to incentivize users to rank high-quality news content in order to filter out fake news from real news.\nWarsaw-based Userfeeds is developing a new solution that uses \u201cthe principles and methods of Bitcoin and Ethereum to create transparent and publicly auditable content networks and ranking algorithms that use digital tokens as ranking signals,\u201d according to a statement on the company\u2019s blog.\nThe Userfeeds team was co-founded by CEO Maciej Olpinski, who previously worked for Google and YouTube, and CTO Greg Kapkowski, an experienced software engineer. They believe that the current system of news discovery and content ranking which involves links, likes and upvotes is broken as it can easily be manipulated by third parties. This enables \u201cfake news\u201d to rank high on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as on Google\u2019s news search. \u00a0\nUserfeeds\u2019 first product, Userfeeds Engine, is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It will enable developers, publishers and users to run custom content rankings to produce search results, recommendation systems, news feeds, listicles and sponsored links. Its goal is to create new business model opportunities for content publishers and developers beyond advertising and subscriptions.\nThe new platform aims to build an incentive-based system that allows digital content such as news articles, blog posts and YouTube videos, for example, to be backed by tokens. These tokens can then be exchanged by users, which produces a time-stamped transaction that can be publicly viewed as a link between the content curator and the content they are backing. This process enables content curators to demonstrate confidence in the content they are posting and makes them accountable.\nUserfeeds expects the platform\u2019s reputation tokens to gain value within their specific categories or applications. Furthermore, as is the case for most blockchain-based tokens, they will also be tradable for other currencies to create a mechanism by which content curators can generate revenue for sharing valuable content from trustworthy sources. \nTo build its new solution, the startup has managed to raise $800,000 in seed funding from BlueYard Capital, Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and Data Ventures\u2019 Piotr Smolen according to a TechCrunch report. \nNow that the company\u2019s seed funding round has been completed, Olpinski told Bitcoin Magazine that it plans \u201cto use this funding to deliver the Userfeeds Engine, the developer focused platform and APIs for 'tokenized' content rankings. In addition to that, we\u2019ll build in-house applications that showcase how the Engine can be used to deliver end-user products.\u201d \nUserfeeds provides an example of how blockchain technology can be applied to solve modern day problems. By incentivizing content curators to share only well-sourced quality content, we could soon receive more trustworthy and truthful news in social media feeds.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 8}

According to the announcement of the National Music Publishers\u2019 Association (NMPA), Spotify settled a $25 million deal and a $5 million penalty over unpaid and unmatched songs.\nUpon the settlement of the $30 million deal, Spotify\u2019s Global Head of Communications and Public Policy Jonathan Prince admitted that while the company has been committed in compensating its musicians and publishers since its launch in October of 2008, tracking all of its registered songs streamed by tens of millions of users and distributing royalties accurately and proportionally has been difficult.\n\u201cAs we have said many times, we have always been committed to paying songwriters and publishers every penny. We appreciate the hard work of everyone at the NMPA to secure this agreement and we look forward to further collaboration with them as we build a comprehensive publishing administration system,\u201d Prince stated.\nAt the time, NMPA President and CEO David Israelite emphasized that through the multimillion-dollar deal, music streaming service providers including Spotify will allocate more resources into compensating musicians and publishers transparently and properly. He further noted that NMPA and Spotify found the appropriate method of distributing royalties to music creators.\n\u201cI am thrilled that through this agreement both independent and major publishers and songwriters will be able to get what is owed to them. We must continue to push digital services to properly pay for the musical works that fuel their businesses and after much work together, we have found a way for Spotify to quickly get royalties to the right people. I look forward to all NMPA members being paid what they are owed, and I am excited about the creation of a better process moving forward,\u201d Israelite said.\nSpotify\u2019s recent acquisition of Mediachain represents a large part of the vision established with NMPA. By utilizing blockchain technology, which is transparent, immutable and irrefutable, Spotify aims to develop and integrate a more fair platform for musicians and publishers. For this reason, Spotify acquired media-and-information-sharing-focused blockchain infrastructure provider Mediachain.\nThe Spotify development team explained that the engineers and developers of Mediachain will join Spotify in its New York offices to help co-build an efficient royalty-tracking platform specialized for Spotify.\nIn an official statement, Spotify announced:\n\u201cBrooklyn-based Mediachain Labs has been the driving force behind the Mediachain project, a world-class blockchain research agenda and open source protocol to better manage data that is critical to the health of the music industry. The Mediachain team will join our New York City offices and help further Spotify\u2019s journey towards a more fair, transparent and rewarding music industry for creators and rights owners.\u201d\nNext year, in 2018, Spotify will officially launch an initial public offering (IPO) and take the company public. The acquisition of Mediachain and the Spotify team\u2019s dedication to solve issues in regard to royalties and creator compensation, which could potentially emerge as a major financial setback in the future, demonstrate the company\u2019s eagerness to justify its valuation to its investors and its presence in the music industry.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 29}

Chris is also a senior interpreter and translator.\nWith the successful conclusion of a Global Blockchain Summit on April 28, the city of Hangzhou in China has established itself as a rising center of blockchain technology. The conference opened with remarks from Canada\u2019s Don Tapscott, known in China as the godfather of digital economy, who beamed into the conference via video. Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, also gave his insights on why blockchain technology is disrupting the world.\nThe Hangzhou government recently announced that Hangzhou will build China\u2019s first Blockchain Industrial Park with preferential policy support for the companies operating within \u2014 an innovative move deserving of the world\u2019s attention.\nWhy Hangzhou?\nThe capital of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou was a fitting choice to hold a conference, not only because it is a core city that together with Shanghai forms the Yangtze River Delta Economic Zone, China\u2019s most dynamic and innovative city clusters, but also because the Hangzhou government is known to be open to creative companies and talents, as evidenced by the success of Alibaba, the world\u2019s e-commerce behemoth.\nJust 124 miles away from Shanghai \u2014 or one hour by bullet train \u2014 Hangzhou was also the host city to the G20 summit in 2016, an event which brought Hangzhou to the world stage of politics and economics. Now, this latest Global Blockchain Summit seems to tell the world that along with Shanghai and Beijing, Hangzhou is another city in China that has proven itself to be dynamic and open enough to pioneer the innovative and even transformative industry. \nBitcoin Magazine interviewed He Bin, the CEO and founder of imToken, a Hangzhou-based startup focusing on an Ethereum wallet for digital assets management, about his company\u2019s new home city.\n\u201cWe have decided to move our team to the Blockchain Industrial Park. The government of Hangzhou has promised companies moving into the park subsidies for office and talent recruitment, tax deductions and government funding support. However, the supportive attitude of the government matter[s] more to us than that of subsidies. I believe this active approach from the government will enable Hangzhou to stand out as a fintech city.\u201d \n\nDirection from China\u2019s Banking Industry\nBlockchain technology has the potential to overhaul the banking industry and greatly impacts the current monetary mechanism; therefore, central banks around the world are stepping up efforts to implement blockchain technology. People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) has actually revealed several times through Chinese media that it has completed a successful trial run of its own version of digital currency and is moving closer toward being the first central bank to issue a digital currency. Interestingly enough, the Bank of Hangzhou, as a local commercial bank and China\u2019s A-share listed company, also attended the summit. \nHu Feihua, the head of e-banking at the Bank of Hangzhou, told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cBank of Hangzhou is always trying to keep abreast of the most updated technologies beneficial to banks. For blockchain [technology], not only will we try to support the blockchain industry by providing an easy access of loans to startups, but we ourselves have a special team focusing on the research and development of blockchain [technology]. As a matter of fact, Bank of Hangzhou is one the members of a banking think tank that has contributed to PBOC\u2019s digital currency.\u201d\nRegarding concerns that advancement in blockchain technology could lead to possible layoffs, Hu suggested that Bank of Hangzhou is not particularly concerned about the issue. \u00a0\n\u201cThis is an interesting question. Job cuts seem inevitable when it comes to technology innovation. But for Bank of Hangzhou, we actually expect our staff to update themselves in their thinking and skills so that they can offset the risks of being sacked. On the other hand, banks will still be important and there are always rooms for us to use our workforce to increase our standard of service. Therefore, layoffs will not impede us in developing blockchain technology.\u201d \nChina\u2019s Top-to-Bottom Strategy: Take a Conspicuous Role in Blockchain Technology\nHangzhou now boasts 12 blockchain startups, a number only surpassed by Beijing and Shanghai, according to a report released by the financial office of the Hangzhou government. The willingness of a local government to promote a new and disruptive industry in China is not only a reflection of its own economic development but also of the tone set by China\u2019s central government. The fact that users of China\u2019s big three bitcoin exchanges, Huobi, OKCoin and BTCC, are still not allowed to withdraw bitcoins is merely a reflection of China\u2019s determination that financial and social stability should never fall prey to new market behaviors featuring too much speculation, and has nothing to do with China\u2019s attitude toward the blockchain technology that underpins Bitcoin. \nAccording to China\u2019s Premier Li Keqiang last year, in China\u2019s Information Technology Application of the 13th Five-Year Plan for the social and economic development of China, blockchain technology has been listed as an important direction for Chinese endeavors. The five-year plan is the most important national strategic guideline for China\u2019s social and economic development. The 13th Five-Year Plan sets the tone for China\u2019s development for the period from 2016 to 2020. \nNow China\u2019s top-level strategy is being implemented well down to the local level as shown in Hangzhou\u2019s blockchain summit. It is natural to predict that more capital, in terms of funding, talents and wisdom, will congregate in China. Cities like Hangzhou and even western cities like Chengdu, which will hold another high-level blockchain summit in the middle of June, are drawing attention from around the world the globe by competing with Beijing and Shanghai. Thus, unlike in the third industrial revolution of the 1970s, China as a whole now seems to be poised and ready to seize the opportunities brought by this next technological revolution, which, as many have believed, will become the driving force of the fifth industrial revolution.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 2}

Bitcoin managed to keep its positive momentum after rallying in April to peak at $1,441.39 following the news that Japan has officially recognized bitcoin as a legal payment method and that Russia\u2019s lawmakers are planning to do the same.\nHowever, the tremendous rally in altcoins has also really stood out in the past few weeks. \nEther\nThe second largest digital currency, Ethereum\u2019s ether, has also hit a new all-time high in the past week as it surpassed the $80 mark. Only two months prior, ether was trading at around $15 per token. The wave of positive news surrounding the testing and future adoption of the Ethereum blockchain by commercial industries, combined with a wide range of new crypto projects built on the top of the Ethereum blockchain that have been fundraising through initial coin offerings, have given the currency a massive boost in recent weeks. \nRipple\nLike Ethereum, the Ripple network is experiencing adoption by a large number of financial institutions to process domestic and cross-border payments. This, in turn, has sparked interest in Ripple\u2019s digital currency, which has had an impressive rally in the last two months, increasing from $0.0054 on March 1 to $0.054 on May 1, peaking at $0.0714 on April 2. \u00a0\nLitecoin\nLitecoin, which has traditionally been considered the digital \u201csilver\u201d to bitcoin\u2019s \u201cgold,\u201d has experienced an impressive rally since talks of SegWit implementation started. In the last 30 days, the price of Litecoin increased from $6.74 to surpass the $15 mark on April 25.\nCharlie Lee, the inventor of Litecoin and director of engineering at Coinbase, has been an outspoken supporter of SegWit implementation for \u201chis\u201d altcoin and managed to convince the majority of litecoin miners to follow suit. Litecoin reached the SegWit activation signaling threshold of 75 percent on April 26, and the changes to the network will take effect within the next two weeks. \nAnonymity-Focused Altcoins \nWith new ways of identifying bitcoin users having been made public, and the call for more bitcoin regulation coming out of regions such as the European Union, anonymity-focused digital currencies are seeing a surge in demand. \nLeading these digital currencies, DASH, Monero, Zcash and the relatively new PIVX have all rallied substantially in the last two months. \nFrom March 1 to May 1, DASH rallied from $33 to hit its all-time high of $117.78 on March 18, according to CoinMarketCap. Currently, DASH is trading at around $87. \nMonero (XMR) also gained in value, rallying from around $13 to reach its all-time high of $25.99 on March 17. Now Monero is trading in the $22\u2013$23 range.\nZcash (XEC) also managed to reemerge after a quiet period within its community following its high-profile ICO, rallying from $40 to surpass the $100 mark on May 1. Now Zcash is trading at around $93. \nThe newest member of the privacy-centered digital currency club, PIVX, rallied from $0.045 on March 1 to surpass the $2 mark, peaking at $2.11 on April 16. The new community-focused currency is currently trading at around $1.60, and its market capitalization is coming close to that of Zcash. \n\nLearn more about altcoins in What is an Altcoin?\n\nProceed With Caution\nInterestingly, all of the 15 largest altcoins in terms of market capitalization have rallied in the month of April, indicating strong investor interest in bitcoin\u2019s alternatives. This can also be seen when looking at the drop in bitcoin\u2019s market share of the global digital currency market. \nOn April 30, the Bitcoin Dominance Index dropped below 60 percent for the first time ever, suggesting that investor interest in altcoins is growing and that the size of the altcoin market may soon outgrow the market capitalization of bitcoin. \nThe surge in demand for altcoins and the increase of their market share can be attributed to investors\u2019 desire to earn higher returns by investing in less mature digital currencies, which have the potential to generate better returns than bitcoin, as well as the increase in ICO activities that have been catching the attention of yield-hungry investors. \nWhile the impressive rally in altcoins is drawing more investor attention toward bitcoin\u2019s alternatives, it is important to note that they are also substantially riskier investments than bitcoin \u2014 after all, these altcoins are largely untested and relatively unstable \u2014 \u00a0and that their prices can often drop faster than they rallied. Generally speaking, when an asset class spikes at a very fast pace within a short period of time, a correction is just around the corner. Something to be mindful of when making your next altcoin investment in the current market climate.", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 2}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nBlockstack is a new ecosystem of decentralized applications (dapps), which allow users to store their own data locally and connect with one another in a direct, encrypted manner. On the latest episode of \u201cThe Bitcoin Game,\u201d Blockstack Co-founder Ryan Shea explained how this new ecosystem of dapps works and why it\u2019s important.\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at how the internet has become so consolidated,\u201d said Shea. \u201cWe\u2019re so reliant upon a very small set of companies, and there are so many external dependencies. We essentially are reliant upon Facebook, Google and Amazon just to use the internet. In a sense, they are the internet.\n\u201cThey are the lords, and we are the serfs,\u201d Shea added.\nAccording to Shea, the original vision of the internet was much more decentralized than how it is structured today. Instead of everyone hosting their own servers, merchants sell their products on Amazon and individuals post their social updates to Facebook. According to some polls, many Facebook users don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re using the internet.\nWith so much internet traffic going through a few major portals, Shea said there are a number of concerns related to security, monopoly power and innovation that can arise. In his view, it is important for everyone to control their own safety and freedom on the internet.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, each of us want to be able to control our own experiences, we want to know that we\u2019re safe and in control and free \u2014 whether it\u2019s on the internet or any aspect of our lives,\u201d said Shea.\nBlockstack\u2019s ecosystem of dapps is an attempt to redecentralize the internet and bring it back to its roots.\nThe Concept of Decentralized Applications\nDapps built on top of Blockstack essentially put users in control of their own data and force them to take responsibility for their own security instead of outsourcing it to a third party.\n\u201c[Applications run] locally,\u201d said Shea. \u201cIf you do that, I do that, and we\u2019re friends with each other on this application, then I can send you a message and it will get sent directly to you and won\u2019t require any other third parties for the message to go through.\u201d\nBlockstack uses a new domain name system (DNS) built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain as the basis for these dapps. The DNS allows users to attach information to identities stored on the blockchain. The decentralized DNS allows users to communicate and connect with one another in a direct, secure and encrypted manner.\nThe heavy reliance on this new, decentralized DNS means users will need to be able to protect their own private keys. According to Shea, Blockstack is working on a variety of user-friendly key management solutions involving multifactor authentication and hardware wallets.\nIn addition to storing data locally, Blockstack users can also back up their encrypted application data on any cloud storage provider, from traditional solutions like Dropbox to new alternatives such as Storj.\nSpecifics Examples of Decentralized Applications\nAccording to Shea, developers are building a variety of applications on top of Blockstack right now, including a decentralized alternative to Twitter.\n\u201cA P2P social network can exist, and the key to that is allowing each user to control their experience on their own local device and then helping users connect to one another so they can discover each other\u2019s content,\u201d said Shea.\nShea also had high praise for OpenBazaar, which is a decentralized e-commerce platform that uses Blockstack\u2019s DNS for user names and bitcoin for payments.\n\u201cThey are the future of commerce,\u201d Shea said of OpenBazaar.\nShea is also of the belief that some method of indexing and parsing data on Blockstack\u2019s new, decentralized version of the internet will emerge, which would be similar to what Google has done on the traditional internet.\n\u201cSome decentralized network will grow to compete in some way with Google; that\u2019s my prediction,\u201d said Shea.\nThoughts on Ethereum\nRight now, the dapps that are gaining the most attention are the ones launching initial coin offerings (ICOs) on top of Ethereum rather than building on top of Blockstack.\nShea claimed he is \u201creally intrigued\u201d by Ethereum and thinks \u201cvery interesting things are being built on top of it,\u201d but he\u2019s also concerned with some of the issues they\u2019ll face over the long term. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about remote code execution,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the general philosophy of putting a large amount of logic on the chain, but I think it\u2019s been a great platform where there\u2019s been a lot of prototyping going on.\u201d\nIn contrast to most dapps built on Ethereum, Blockstack dapps only utilize a blockchain for the naming layer. \u201cEverything else is off the blockchain,\u201d said Shea.\n\u201cBlockstack is blockchain agnostic,\u201d Shea clarified. \u201cOur philosophy is to operate on as many blockchains as possible but, whenever we can, rely upon the most secure and stable blockchain platform.

Duchenne added that Mauritius will have free Wi-Fi available across most of the country by the end of the year.\n\u201c[Mauritius] proposes to leverage the aspects of a tropical lifestyle, modern living, innovation and incentives to attract an innovative and practical blockchain culture,\u201d said Duchenne. \u201cThe vision is to focus all aspects of blockchain innovation and commercial applications in a geographical area, then expand the same to other areas of Mauritius and Africa.\u201d\nHow Blockchain Technology Can Help in Africa and Asia\nLike many others who are excited by blockchain-based platforms, Duchenne believes that this new technology will impact virtually every industry. \u201cIn the long-term this means that useful applications are not restricted to geographic locations,\u201d he added.\nAccording to Duchenne, there is a chance that some of the lesser-known regions around the world will be able to leapfrog traditional centers of innovation due to the level playing field created by this new technology.\n\u201cShort-term, however, applications that unlock and advertise the productive potential of the unbanked on global financial markets with adequate protections, [such as identity and Know Your Customer], with little friction or intermediaries are ideal,\u201d said Duchenne in terms of the types of applications that could become popular in Africa and Asia. \u201cOthers are crowdfunding renewable energy projects and microcredit. To achieve this, it is important that local stakeholders acquire an appreciation of the disruptive potential we\u2019re dealing with and how to take advantage of it.\u201d\nPermissioned Ledgers vs. Public Blockchains\nIn terms of whether specific types of blockchains will be preferred over others in the future, Duchenne claimed that permissioned ledgers may have some usefulness, but he added, \u201cWhile we don\u2019t know the future, my guess is that ultimately, public blockchains, much like the internet, will be more valuable than a consortium-type intranet (permissioned ledgers), but that both will coexist.\u201d\nDuchenne claimed that bridges will inevitably be built between the permissioned ledger and public blockchain ecosystems.\nAccording to Duchenne, there are also reasons to remain skeptical at times when it comes to companies touting their use of blockchain technology. \u201cIt is important to separate hype from reality,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, I heard of a company winning a contract because it mentioned the word \u2018blockchain,\u2019 without understanding, truly understanding, [what] that meant!\u201d\nDuchenne is also of the opinion that Ethereum will be the main platform for blockchain-related innovation in the future.\n\u201cEthereum is where I believe most of the growth and explosion of practical innovation will be,\u201d said Duchenne. \u201cThe mindshare and traction that it has (example, ConsenSys) is phenomenal. For this reason, I think that you must have a very good reason to not choose Ethereum as the blockchain for commercial applications today.\u201d\nAlthough Duchenne is bullish on Ethereum, he also referred to Bitcoin as \u201cthe mother of all blockchains\u201d with \u201ca network effect that\u2019s hard to dislodge.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 2}

According to Don Tapscott, noted Canadian blockchain thought leader and the bestselling author of the book \u201cBlockchain Revolution,\u201d Canada\u2019s economic evolution is bolstered by the intersection between the internet and blockchain technology. This assertion is addressed in a recent report he co-produced with his son Alex, The Blockchain Corridor: Building an Innovation Economy in the 2nd Era of the Internet.\nAccording to the Tapscotts, the first internet era was predicated on the availability of information and content anywhere in the world and at any time. Now the second era, fueled by blockchain technology, is ushering in what is known as the Internet of Value, featuring a revolutionary distributed platform poised to reshape and advance the global business environment and world order. \nThis report goes on to suggest that Canada is rapidly emerging as the second era\u2019s global hub or, at the very least, one of a select group of such hubs. Bolstered by Canada\u2019s booming tech corridor located between Toronto and Kitchener-Waterloo in southern Ontario, as well as its world leadership in quantum physics and artificial intelligence, this North American nation is well positioned for the new blockchain economy. \nThen there are the fortunes of Vitalik Buterin, the tech wonderkid who grew up in Canada and was the primary co-founder of Ethereum, viewed by many as one of the most important blockchain projects in the world, with a market cap of nearly $2 billion. \nCurrently a number of ventures are part of a growing diaspora of entrepreneurs and startups in Canada, including the likes of Paycase, Protocol Fund, Tendermint, Nuco, Smartwallet, Jaxx/Decentral and Blockstream. They are situated in major cities like Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal and elsewhere throughout Canada. \nDon Tapscott says that the ultimate purpose of the report, written for the Canadian Federal Government, was to highlight what\u2019s actually feasible for Canada in terms of becoming the global center of blockchain innovation. \u201cWe make a number of pretty radical recommendations to the Canadian government about what they should be doing.\u201d\nHe cites Toronto\u2019s rich trove of schools, good computer science advancements and collaborative financial institutions as a key catalyst of this run on innovation. Continues Tapscott: \u201cWe have a growing number of powerful incubators and accelerators, such as the Ryerson DMZ, which was rated #1 in North America. And the recently established Blockchain Research Institute has garnered significant funding and buy-in from the federal government, Ontario government and the City of Toronto. Even the Toronto Stock Exchange as well as a big hospital network here are in the mix.\u201d\nTapscott mused, \u201cIt\u2019s a weird thing because who would have figured Canada would emerge as the epicenter of the global blockchain movement?\u201d\nUpcoming Conference Signals Continued Advancement\nThe Blockchain Association of Canada has announced its Blockchain Government Forum on June 12\u201313, 2017, at the Innovation Centre at Bayview Yards. It will be held in Ottawa, one of Canada\u2019s leading innovation centers, the nation\u2019s capital and the home of the federal government. \nThis two-day conference will focus on how blockchain technology will impact government services in the near future. 160 participants will gather to discuss topics including digital identity, the future of healthcare, smart cities and digital voting. The event will be a mixture of keynotes, panels, workshops and use case presentations on behalf of blockchain industry companies.\nKyle Kemper, executive director of the Blockchain Association of Canada, says that one of the key areas of focus these days in the blockchain space is tokenization. He cites Ethereum\u2019s ongoing efforts to assist organizations and industries in the creation of blockchain-based tokens as one such project. \u201cWe can see it in the recent ICOs (initial coin offerings) where companies are raising millions of dollars in capital from global pools of token-based capital.\u201d\nHe says that digital identity is another focal point in Canada where blockchain technology is being used to secure the records, proofs and access to identity information. Then there is ConsenSys\u2019s efforts at developing solutions for decentralized voting. Says Kemper: \u201cOne day we will be voting from our cell phones in a general election; this is super exciting and entirely possible (and secure) with blockchain technology.\u201d \nAccording to Kemper, the Canadian government is definitely interested in exploring and supporting blockchain technology. \u201cThe Blockchain Research Institute, founded by Don Tapscott, has secured investment from the government of Ontario. And the Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) has blockchain [technology] all over their radar. So I\u2019m confident that there will be blockchain innovation running within government agencies by the year end.\u201d \u00a0\nKemper highlighted four Canadian factors that are the driving force behind Canada\u2019s emergence as one of the world\u2019s leading blockchain nations:\nRobust access to high-speed internet;High levels of education, both general and technical;High standards of living;A permissive government and regulatory environment in the country.\n\u201cThe internet is quickly entering a second generation and it is feasible that the vast ecosystem for this new era of technology could be based in Canada,\u201d Kemper concluded. \u201cWe are no doubt excited about the prospect of this.\u201d \u00a0", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 3}

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nDespite a recent correction and profit-taking with bitcoin, the top five coins by market capitalization continue showing extremely strong gains. Ether (ETH) has risen over 100% since April 24th and has made new all-time highs (ATH) in market capitalization every day. \n\nHash rate however has slowed slightly, currently sitting near its ATH.\n\nBased on inflation, Ethereum needs a significant infusion of cash per day to keep up with block rewards to remain at its current price. This could be some cause for concern for long-term holders of ETH. \n\nGDAX continues to handedly lead the ETH-USD volume, suggesting on-ramping remains strong. The GDAX price has also begun closing in on the Bitfinex premium, which remains in place due to USD deposit and withdrawal halt on that exchange.\n\nThere is an active and near-complete bullish chart pattern, the Cup and Handle. \n\nThe chart pattern includes a matching descending volume profile for the cup as well as the handle. A resolution of the diagonal resistance should yield a break of the local high on volume. The measured move is ~$129.35 (0.0812) and the Fibonacci extension is ~$119.47 (0.075). The pattern has broken the resistance and is retesting this zone to confirm support. This is not uncommon and is known as a throwback. The stop for this trade would be a candle close on this timeframe below the tip of the handle. \nNon-conservative Fibonacci Extensions from extreme low to previous high yield similar targets. \n\nGenerally, I have mixed feelings trading small timeframes like the 15 minute, but when taking into account a large amount of data, some patterns and entries become more obvious.\n\nUsing the 50/200 EMA, you can see an excellent EMA cross entry based on April 26th, which later recrosses as a close signal on May 1st. Depending on how you play stops, such as price breaking the 200 EMA, this trade would have closed sooner. Then, as the 50/200 EMA cross remains bearish, price builds a triangle which breaks just before the 50/200 EMA cross. I would look for similar conditions for a long exit and re-entry within the next few days, should the 50/200 EMA cross bearish again. \u00a0\nSummary\n\nEthereum continues to make massive gains with no sign of stopping. Technicals continue to show high probability for $100+ Ethereum. Using low timeframes for signals is generally a fool\u2019s errand unless you take into account a large amount of data to better understand price structure.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Despite a number of promising use cases in the financial industry as well as clear application for sectors like healthcare, utilities and transportation, among many others, blockchain\u2019s potential is a long way from being fully realized.\nEY (formerly Ernst & Young), a global leader in assurance, tax, transaction and advisory services believes that the time is ripe for blockchain to move deep into the world of commercialized solutions. In support of this endeavor, it recently announced the launch of EY Ops Chain, a set of applications and services that support efforts on the part of organizations to boost the commercial integration of blockchain technology across diverse industries \u2014 not just finance. \nDeveloped jointly by EY and a host of other industry collaborators, EY Ops works integratively with EY\u2019s broad swath of consulting, tax and audit expertise to bring real world solutions to the enterprise and supply chain management space. \nThrough the use of EY Ops, supply chain systems can be simplified and seamlessly integrated into digital contracts, inventory systems, logistics protocols, pricing, inventory and payments. This can lead to enhanced forecast accuracy and performance outcomes while ensuring a reduction of working capital requirements. Through this new development, EY will begin with offering financial services and supply chain management solutions across a number of different industries, including oil and gas, media and entertainment and automotive, among others. \nAdvancing Blockchain Technology\nAs further indication of EY\u2019s investment in blockchain technology, the organization also recently launched its Blockchain Lab in New York, coalescing financial services work with blockchain solutions in a single locale centered in New York\u2019s Union Square. This lab is the third for EY, joining their two other key blockchain centers in London and Trivandrum, part of EY\u2019s global research ecosystem, EY wavespace\u2122.\nTo fuel the launch of EY Ops Chain, EY is pouring money into research while attracting top talent in areas like cryptography, physics, math and software development \u2014 all with the goal of building momentum around the mature and scalable design of blockchain services. These professionals will be charged with assisting clients in applying blockchain and distributed ledger technology amid a rapidly evolving blockchain environment. \nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Paul Brody, EY\u2019s Global Innovation Leader, said that EY is strongly invested in putting blockchain technology to work in the commercial realm. \u201cWe believe that while most companies are much more focused on being part of large scale ecosystems, their IT capabilities haven't kept up. Using blockchains, EY can give companies visibility to supply chains, billing and payments across their ecosystem in a way that\u2019s far more reliable and accurate than in the past. We think we can have a significant impact on working capital and operating costs as well as time-to-market.\u201d \nMulti-enterprise collaboration, said Brody, is at the heart of EY\u2019s vision for taking blockchains into the enterprise. \u00a0He noted that historically, companies have managed collaboration by sending messages to each other on a one-to-one basis resulting in many islands of information. \u201cBlockchain and supply chain management are an especially good fit because of the distributed and multi-party nature of the business. With blockchain, we can get universal visibility and synchronization of data without having to compromise on security and privacy.\u201d\nPutting the Blockchain to Work\nBrody says that EY is currently working with a manufacturing company that has been struggling to manage its complex procurement process with multiple contract manufacturers and suppliers. At present, he says, the company\u2019s collaborations on everything from pricing to purchase orders is managed on a point-to-point basis using emailed Excel spreadsheets. However, with the new blockchain solution, notes Brody, every supplier and participant in the network will maintain a single integrated view of purchasing, payments and pricing.\n\u201cThe cost savings just from reduced auditing will pay for the entire investment, but the real gains come from [the integration of] suppliers to payments and invoicing and operations. Our client\u00a0will have accurate system-wide visibility to inventory and need significantly less working capital to run the network when this system goes to full production,\u201d said Brody.\nLooking Ahead\n\u201cSupply chain management, procurement and order to cash processes are probably the hottest areas right now outside of finance,\u201d said Brody. \u201cRelated to that, we think there will be a big push around tax, audit and cybersecurity as enterprises embrace the immutable and distributed nature of blockchain technology.\u201d\nEven in the short term, Brody expects that many companies will embrace private blockchains to replace point-to-point EDI and XML systems in the supply chain. In the days ahead, he points to three significant evolutions: \u201cFirst, we believe there will be a move toward operating work involving billing and payments to drive gains in working capital. Second, we see an extension of the private networks in both directions \u2014 further back across multiple tiers of the supply chain and forward to customers. Finally, we believe that companies will gradually migrate from proprietary private blockchains to public networks where they can capture the full network effects of the technology.\u201d\u00a0", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 3}
{"title": "The Lost Records of Shantou: A Case for Blockchain Tokenization", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/lost-records-shantou-case-tokenization/", "birthday": "May 4, 2017  2:23 PM EST", "date": "2017-05-04 19:23:00", "content": "In the Guangdong Province of China, Shantou was once a flourishing port city where European traders had their businesses and homes. In the early 1900s, they built a brand new central district near the river in Shantou with consulate buildings, apartments, bars and restaurants. It was a spectacular mix of Victorian English and classical Chinese styles and soon became a mainstay and provincial destination.\n\nThe Old Central District in Shantou\nOver the years, however, Shantou lost its status as a top commercial hub, as bigger ports emerged in nearby Shenzhen and Guangzhou. As foreign traders left the city, the central district fell into a state of disrepair. Without the once thriving businesses, the local Chinese owners couldn\u2019t maintain their own buildings and, as generations passed, descendants of the owners moved to newer parts of town.\nToday, Shantou\u2019s old central district is a dismal, rundown slum. You can still see the charm in the vintage architecture, but facades are falling to the ground and walls are crumbling. As random tourists stroll the lanes taking photographs, they wonder why the owners haven\u2019t paid for renovations or sold the buildings to new owners who could fix them up.\n \nNow Just an Empty Street of Crumbling Buildings\u00a0\n\n With No Ownership Rights, Nothing Can Be Restored\n\nOnce a Popular Hotel in Old Shantou\nMeanwhile, just north of Shantou, Chaozhou has a newly restored and booming old city, with shops, guesthouses, restaurants and people spending money. In other parts of China, old villages and districts like this one have been restored, drawing business owners, locals and domestic tourists.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nGates To The Restored Old City of Chaozhou, Shantou\u2019s Neighbor to the North\nBecause Chaozhou is a prefecture-level city, the government intervened to restore the streets and buildings. But in Shantou, there have been no renovations because no one in the city knows who owns the hopeless buildings: the deeds to the properties are nowhere to be found. If the deeds still existed, the buildings would be fixed, business owners would move in, and again it would become a busy district of the city. Eventually, just like in Chaozhou, the government will have to intervene with public funds.\nBut today, with the advent of the blockchain, technology can solve this age-old problem in Shantou. With the digitization (or tokenization) of assets, there will never be a need to keep a deed or piece of paper as records can be safely kept forever on the blockchain. \n A Homegrown Solution\nBased in Shanghai, Antshares is a Chinese blockchain led by developer Erik Zhang, who has studied Bitcoin and Ethereum, and believes China needs its own, homegrown blockchain solution. Having built Antshares as an open-source protocol, Zhang hopes that people in his country will soon be building apps and digitizing their assets with his technology. And by tokenizing real-world assets such as stock certificates, cars, homes and even people, Zhang believes he can help prevent what happened in old Shantou from happening again in the future. \nBitcoin Magazine interviewed Mr. Zhang about his plans for the tokenization of assets on the Antshares blockchain to find out how it works and what major changes it will bring to the world around us.\n\nBitcoin Magazine: How will the digitization or tokenization of assets work?\nErik Zhang: We usually divide digital assets into two categories, one for voucher assets and the other for credit assets. Digitizing a voucher asset means that we digitize contracts or licenses, such as the transfer agreement of a company's equity, stock certificates, a real estate license and so on.\nA credit asset refers to the creation of a new digital asset and guaranteeing it as redeemable for a real physical asset in real terms. This can be done with an ounce of gold (or any quantity), a car, a Picasso painting, or as you mentioned, a home. It means creating a digital token that represents ownership of a physical asset, which can be bought, sold, transferred or stored in a secure manner.\nBM: How is a digital token created?\nEZ: Well, the answer is rather technical and perhaps boring for the average reader. But to do so on Antshares, for example, we would:\nCreate a numeric identity on the blockchain which can be implemented through a digital certificate. The digital certificate exists on the blockchain with a public key or address;Use a private key of the digital certificate to register the commitment of the asset;Safeguard the digital certificate and digital signature on the blockchain;Allow other people to verify a digital identity through the digital certificate, and confirm the issuer/owner of the asset.\nOnce an asset is digitized, it can be transferred and traded on the blockchain, and there will be advanced operations that can be performed using smart contracts.\nBM: So, in essence, what does this do? \nEZ: Basically it records and protects data in a way that can\u2019t be altered or transferred without the owner\u2019s explicit consent. Consent, in these cases, will require a digital signature that can be verified on the blockchain. So if you have tokenized your home, for example, then your legal ownership of the home will be recorded by a digital \u201ctoken,\u201d and the fact of your ownership can only be changed or transferred when you have provided your private key (password). \nIn the case of Shantou, or anywhere else for that matter, this will also make it so that lost deeds will never result in such a public dilemma. Records of property ownership will never be lost, destroyed, falsely altered or transferred without consent. \nBM: And what will we do with the tokens?\nEZ: As far as securing our digital assets, advancements are being made in digital wallet technology so that we can safely store our digital assets. When you want to sell your property, then to complete the sale, you can transfer your token to the new owner digitally on the blockchain. \nBM: So, in theory, anything can be tokenized. Do you think that someday we will tokenize ourselves?\nEZ: (Laughs) Sure. I believe we will see birth certificates, marriage certificates, diplomas\u2026 and entire digital identities on the blockchain. In fact, digital identities are necessary for this whole ecosystem to work. Today, we use so many different types of personal identification: passports, ID cards, driver\u2019s licenses, credit scores. With digital ID\u2019s, people can build a single, comprehensive reputation on the blockchain which can be securely protected and used in any digital transaction. Tokenizing ourselves is a very important part of the future of blockchain technology.\nBM: What kind of changes will this bring to the world?\nEZ: Well, that is a big question with many implications. But in the case we see here, it will preserve the integrity of data and prevent the loss of ownership rights, such as we see in the case of Shantou. It will also have an impact on the environment as it will almost entirely eliminate the need for paperwork. But again, the implications of blockchain technology are so far-reaching that no one really knows of all the changes it will bring. We have many exciting ideas about it, but for the answer, we will have to wait and see.\nBM: When will Antshares begin doing this?\nEZ: Over the last year, we have made great progress with our core technology. This can be seen with the recent upgrades to our Antshares core wallet and our code updates on Github. We are a small, dedicated and talented team, and we will be working hard to build a community around our open-source platform. You will be seeing a lot of exciting news from Antshares in the near future.\n\nRead more about other blockchain solutions for land and title registry around the world: \nBitFury Announces Blockchain Land Titling Project With the Republic of Georgia and Economist Hernando De SotoTitle Deed Solution Leverages Ethereum Blockchain to Secure Top Finish in Dubai HackathonSweden Conducts Trials of a Blockchain Smart Contracts Technology for Land Registry \n\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 4}

Despite this, India ranks 97th out of 118 countries on the Global Hunger Index (GHI), according to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). While millions of dollars are spent every year on tackling malnutrition, 3,000 children die every day due to hunger.\nIn a bid to combat this problem, Accenture Labs has teamed up with Akshaya Patra, the world\u2019s largest NGO-run mid-day meal program, to use disruptive technologies such as the blockchain, the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to boost the number of meals served to children in schools in India that are run and aided by the government. \nSince 2000, Akshaya Patra has been working toward reaching more children to provide them with wholesome food every single school day. When it first started it was serving 1,500 schoolchildren in five schools. Now, it reaches more than 1.6 million children from over 13,500 schools across 11 states in India. \nBy teaming up with Accenture Labs, Akshaya Patra aims to feed even more children by expanding its reach through Accenture\u2019s Tech for Good initiative. As the two organizations worked on their \u201cMillion Meals\u201d project over a six-month period in Akshaya Patra\u2019s Bengaluru kitchen, they illustrated how technologies such as the blockchain, IoT and artificial intelligence can be utilized to help address significant challenges in mass meal production and delivery. \nAkshaya Patra employs unskilled workers in its operations and the data is recorded manually; however, as the data needs to be collated on a routine basis, it can have a direct impact on the planning and kitting process. \n\u201cWe realized that having real-time data on the cloud would be beneficial as it will enable traceability and decision making in limited time frames during emergencies,\u201d said Shridhar Venkat, CEO of the Akshaya Patra Foundation, speaking to Bitcoin Magazine. \nBy analyzing the daily demand for meals on an Android phone, the location-aware artificial intelligence system can predict the demand requirement for each school each day by reviewing all the historical transactions, thus enabling quick decision-making on the spot and enhancing efficiency. \nIn Akshaya Patra\u2019s Bengaluru kitchen, cooking is improved by working from more than 15 recipes while IoT-based sensors, which are installed in the cookers, facilitate real-time monitoring of the cooking process. Whenever there is a deviation, workers are prompted to take immediate action. \nOn systematic review of the collected information, it is possible to identify gaps in the system and put in control measures, thereby optimizing the resources, Venkat explained. \n\u201cWhen the production starts, the supervisor updates the sequence of activities for which the time and temperature gets captured from the cloud,\u201d he added. \u201cIn case the requisite temperature is not met, one has to wait to attain the right temperature, which ensures real-time monitoring of time and temperature.\u201d \nA further key component of Akshaya Patra\u2019s operations is its invoicing and audits.

E2E Product using asset-backed Crypto-EURO for payments,\u201d and added that now there is \u201cseamless & affordable Electric Vehicle Charging on Ethereum BlockChain.\u201d \nThe new e-mobility solution allows owners of electric cars to charge their vehicles at any of the new charging stations set up by innogy Innovation Hub\u2019s startup venture Share&Charge, as well as already existing charging points by making digital payments in euros using the Share&Charge app. \nThis app is the world\u2019s first e-mobility community platform that uses blockchain technology. Launched by the Germany-based startup Share&Charge, which will soon operate independently under its new name, \u201cMotionwerk,\u201d the platform creates a new sharing economy service for the e-mobility sector by leveraging the public Ethereum blockchain as a transaction layer. \nShare&Charge uses three different types of smart contracts running on the Ethereum blockchain. It deploys LibManager, which allows contracts to hold references to other contracts so that existing contracts can be updated in case of bugs or required fixes. It also uses MobilityToken, a smart contract to hold balances and enforce the regulatory framework. And, finally, it also utilizes ChargingPoles, a registry of all charging poles, which also on-boards the logic required to process start/stop operations at the charging stations. \nPayments for charging electric vehicles are made using Mobility Tokens, which are euro-backed digital tokens that can be acquired through the Share&Charge app and is available for both Android and iOS smartphone users.\nE-mobility drivers now have a much wider network of charging stations that can easily be found and paid for using the app, thereby reducing the chance of a flat battery. Furthermore, businesses and individuals who own charging stations can now make them available to e-mobility drivers and decide on the rates they want to charge for providing electricity, as well as parking spaces at the charging stations, and thus create an entirely new sharing economy surrounding the e-mobility sector. \nDietrich S\u00fcmmermann, co-founder of Share&Charge, believes that the car of the future will be electric, autonomous and part of the wider sharing economy. His goal is to give individuals and companies the right instruments that will enable them to play a role in the future of private mobility. \n\u201cThe entire market structure of the automotive industry and the associated energy industries is in a period of change. While petrol-driven cars still require filling stations, soon, infrastructure monopolies of this kind will no longer be necessary. Hundreds of plug-in units can undertake this task instead. And they won\u2019t [be] available at a few selected locations, but on a decentralized basis with lots of individual units,\u201d said S\u00fcmmermann in a statement. \nSt\u00f6cker is proud of what innogy and Share&Charge have achieved. \u201cWith the help of blockchain technology, Share&Charge is bringing a sense of democracy to e-charging points. In addition to this, the startup has brought hundreds of innogy charging points to the blockchain and has, therefore, become the first company worldwide to \u201cblockchainify\u201d charging points all over the country,\u201d he said. \nInnogy Innovation Hub chose the Ethereum blockchain over developing its own proprietary blockchain for the project. As St\u00f6cker told Bitcoin Magazine: \u201cWe believe in open blockchain platforms with a strong, diverse and enthusiastic ecosystem. These ecosystems deliver exponential network effects driving innovative technology, business and personal solutions. Therefore, Ethereum is the one and only natural choice for us.\u201d\nThe Future of Private Transport\nThe launch of the new blockchain-powered electric-vehicle charging stations is a step closer to Carsten St\u00f6cker\u2019s and his colleague Thomas Birr\u2019s vision of the future of transport, which they outlined in a publication on the World Economic Forum website. \u00a0\nSt\u00f6cker and Birr envision a future where cities will be filled with fleets of autonomous electric vehicles. Their new app will help someone looking for private transport to discover available vehicles and then agree electronically on the terms and conditions including the rental fee with the vehicle owner. The agreement is then coded into a smart contract that automatically charges the driver and pays the vehicle owner directly upon completion of the journey. \nThis process would create an environmentally friendly, decentralized sharing economy for the private transport sector, which would increase the efficiency of private transport as well as reduce congestion as fewer cars would be populating the cities. \nBitcoin Magazine asked St\u00f6cker when he believes his and Birr\u2019s vision of the future of transport will become a present-day reality. \u201cTesla is laying the foundation for P2P car sharing of autonomous and electric vehicles already now. I expect that this service will be available for level 2\u20133 autonomous driving pretty soon. Maybe next year. First FAVES with level 4 in 2020. At this time blockchain [technology] will be mature enough to power a transaction layer for mobility. This will happen in cities that are aiming for technology leadership.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 5}

The Trust currently has around $262 million assets under management. Shares in the Bitcoin Investment Trust can be traded over-the-counter and can be held in traditional investment accounts, such as IRAs and Roth IRAs. \nBy going public, Grayscale Investments wants to open up its bitcoin investment vehicle to a broader investor base that prefers the comfort of investing in an exchange-traded and fully regulated security. \nOn May 4, 2017, Grayscale Investments LLC submitted an amendment to its IPO filing with the SEC increasing the size of its proposed IPO from $500 million to $1 billion dollars suggesting that the interest in a publicly-tradeable and regulated investment vehicle that tracks the price of bitcoin would see substantial interest from institutional and private investors. \nHowever, given the SEC recent decisions not to approve the long-awaited Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF (COIN) as well as the SolidX Bitcoin Trust, the chances for the Bitcoin Investment Trust\u2019s IPO to gain regulatory approval are not high. \nWhile Alan Friedland, founder and CEO of Compcoin, doesn\u2019t hold much hope for the ETF approval just yet, he agrees that there is enough demand from established institution investors for bitcoin as an alternative asset class to merit the $1 billion IPO increase.\n\u201cDigital coins will be the fastest growing financial market and we are projecting a 1.7 trillion dollar market cap by 2025,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine.\nWhen the SEC announced in March that it would not approve the two proposed bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the regulator stated that a bitcoin ETF would require \"surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated.\" \nSince these conditions are still not met for bitcoin, an approval of the Bitcoin Investment Trust looks rather unlikely. \u00a0\nSpencer Bogart, analyst at Blockchain Capital, thinks that it is \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that this renewed ETF consideration will be approved. \u201cThe SEC disapproved the prior two ETFs not because they took issue with the structure of the fund but because the SEC currently considers the major markets on which bitcoin is traded to be too unregulated,\u201d Bogart told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cGiven that this hasn\u2019t changed since the last disapproval, the SEC is unlikely to offer a different response.\u201d\nBogart is more optimistic about the chances of an ETF approval outside of the United States. \u201cI think mainstream investment products will first be approved by foreign regulatory agencies (to some extent this has already happened). In regards to the approval of a U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETF, I think it\u2019s more likely that the SEC changes its view (e.g. with regime change) than it is that the Bitcoin ecosystem changes such that the majority of activity flows to highly regulated markets.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 5, "day": 8}

The report states that as more people opt for subscriptions to streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, revenues in the sector were pushed to a five-year high last year. Total income generated by the U.K. music industry increased by 5 percent to \u00a3925 million ($11.6 million) in 2016, from \u00a3881 million ($11.1 million).\nYet despite the popularity of the music industry, musicians often find themselves unfairly compensated. \nTo rectify this problem, the Open Music Initiative (OMI) and Ujo Music, among others, are attempting to change outdated modes in the music industry to ensure long-term sustainability, with the intent to use blockchain technology to support the creation of music. \nRead our first article in this series: How the Blockchain Lets Musicians Connect with Fans (and Get Paid)\n\n\nOpen Music Initiative \nLaunched by Berklee College of Music\u2019s Institute for Creative Entrepreneurship (BerkleeICE), in partnership with Context Labs and IDEO, and in collaboration with the MIT Media Lab, the Open Music Initiative (OMI) is a nonprofit initiative that is leading its more than 160 global industry members to develop open-source protocols by using blockchain technology, in a federated music ecosystem. Some of the members include Universal Music, Warner Music, Sony Music, Spotify, Intel, Viacom, Red Bull Media, YouTube and Context Labs, as well as blockchain-related startups such as dotBC, BigchainDB and ConsenSys/Ujo. \nOn an OMI blog, Dan Harple, who is the co-founder of OMI, the founder and CEO of Context Labs, and a trustee of the Berklee College of Music, said that the \u201caccelerated growth of the Internet [has] radically changed the way everyone consumes media.\u201d Imagine then the time and effort it takes for a record company to collect the small transactions from the trillions of times a song has been streamed before any royalties can be distributed to an artist. \n\u201cOMI and many of its members believe that many new technologies, such as distributed ledgers, blockchain, etc., can be applied to radically simplify the way music rights owners are identified and compensated,\u201d he said, speaking to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201c[This results] in sustainable and new business models for artists, entrepreneurs and music businesses alike.\u201d \nThrough its OMI Method, which is considered \u201cunique\u201d and \u201cdifferent by design,\u201d according to Harple, OMI has created an ecosystem that ensures it has the right representation involved as it works closely with music creators, producers, musicians representing organizations, and music creator management companies. \nAn important lesson learned along the way was that for many OMI members, a decentralized, federated ecosystem was the best. \n\u201cDecentralization allows for company-to-company interactions and enables everyone to maintain control and ownership of their respective data, while being able to decide who to engage with and which data to exchange,\u201d Harple said. \nThis culminates in the open-protocol API spec that the OMI is working on, called MVI 1.0, or the Minimum Viable Interoperability. In review with its members, it will enable all music ecosystem players to engage in an open, federated model, achieving many of its goals, including to help assure the correct compensation for all creators, performers and rights holders of music, thereby providing a productive field for the creation of music worldwide. \n\u201cThis federation will then enable interlinking of copyright and licensing between composers, songwriters, PROs and publishers across territories,\u201d said Harple. \nUjo Music \nIn the summer of 2015, blockchain startup platform Ujo Music launched Theproblem.wtf to start a conversation focusing on the problems circulating around the music industry. With an infrastructure dating back to 1914, the \u201cinternal plumbing\u201d that underpins the music industry has remained unchanged; in the meantime, however, digitization and globalization have changed the way we consume and listen to music, says Ujo.\nUjo Music teamed up with Grammy-winning British singer and songwriter Imogen Heap to release her song \u201cTiny Human,\u201d which debuted in October 2015, on the Ethereum blockchain. Through the prototype, users purchased licenses to download, stream, remix and sync the song so that each payment was divided on the blockchain and sent to Heap and her collaborators.\n\u201cAfter releasing the demo to prove what is possible with blockchain [technology], we then spent most of 2016 diving into the problems of the music industry and trying to discern what problems we were actually solving,\u201d Jesse Grushack, product manager at Ujo Music, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nUjo is aiming to shift the power back into the hands of artists with the launch their platform later this year. Ujo wants its platform to empower artists with quick payments, to provide them with a place for their music that is rightfully theirs and to enable them to interact more closely with their fans.\nHowever, while a neutral backbone would be of benefit to the music industry, the adoption of it remains a challenge. Not only that, but the Ethereum blockchain is still in the early stages of its development, with Ujo testing concepts and a technology that haven\u2019t been tested before.\nYet Grushack is confident that Ujo can provide a valuable service for artists by focusing on solving problems of ownership rights. It has already attracted a growing list of artists to be part of its beta.\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t solve ownership of rights, then we have failed our main goal, [and] without solving this issue we wouldn\u2019t be different from any solution currently out on the market.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 20}

In December, the trading card game held its soft launch in Canada and Switzerland.\nNow, 18 months after its BitCrystals ICO, in conjunction with Channel 4, the EverdreamSoft team is launching SoG on a worldwide scale.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge milestone because SoG will be one of the first ICO projects that hit the mainstream market,\u201d said Shaban Shaame, CEO and founder of EverdreamSoft, to Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe trading card game, which has been available for play for a while, is committed to true asset ownership. The electronic-format trading cards, which are SoG\u2019s gaming assets, are tied to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. The colorful trading cards \u2014 with real-world value attached to them \u2014 are recorded on the blockchain as they are traded, bought and sold. Spells of Genesis trading cards are purchased with BitCrystals (BCY).\u00a0\nDuring the BitCrystals Token Sale, the supply of BCY was limited to 100,000,000 units. EverdreamSoft was allocated 30 percent, while 70,000,000 BCY were put toward the token sale. Any that didn\u2019t sell by the end of the ICO were burnt. Since the quantity of BitCrystals issued can\u2019t increase, destroying a portion of them leads to deflation, followed by a fall in market supply before a price rise.\u00a0Players can trade their BCY on the blockchain and exchange them for other digital currencies. They can also use them to purchase Spells of Genesis blockchain-based trading cards.\nTo ensure peer-to-peer trading and true ownership of game assets, EverdreamSoft partnered with Tokyo-based IndieSquare to release the Book of Orbs, a mobile wallet that permits users to create and manage blockchain assets via tokens called ORBs (Ownership Revolution on the Blockchain). The tokens are created via Counterparty, a blockchain protocol that extends Bitcoin\u2019s functionality. \nA major advantage of the ORBs is the fact that they are interoperable among other blockchain-based games, permitting cross-game capability between games and apps such as SoG and Force of Will (FoW), another online trading card game.\n\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Koji Higashi, co-founder of IndieSquare, said that cross-game capability is very important.\n\u201cBefore, many games and game items were isolated in their own world, but blockchain [technology] helps open it up and realize many unique possibilities in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the Book of Orbs expands its user base, the synergy will become even greater.\u201d\nHigashi added that the ORB network has become the go-to blockchain digital asset platform and that having full ownership on the blockchain will increase demand for certain game items, making the games more fun and competitive.\nShaame agrees and thinks that SoG is setting a precedent with true ownership.\n\u201cPeople will better understand how card gaming and the basic needs of exchange between players is available now in the digital world,\u201d he said.\nHe adds that this will help to open the door to the mainstream gaming community as gamers have a natural affinity for new technological services.\n\u201cThey will see a real benefit for them by this true ownership that is the first blockchain consumer service before the unrealized ones from the finance, bank and insurance world.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 20}

The main drivers for this rally have been positive news out of Japan and Russia.\nSince April 1, the price of bitcoin rallied from $1,070 to peak at this month\u2019s high of $1,227 on April 11. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at around $1,218 according to BitcoinAverage. The market value of bitcoin has increased from around $17.5 billion on April 1 to surpass $19.5 billion on April 20, according to data compiled by CoinMarketCap. \nBitcoin Is Big in Japan\nJapan officially recognized bitcoin as a legal payment method on April 1, which gave bitcoin an immediate price boost following the announcement. Not only can bitcoin now be legally used in Japan to make purchases and send remittances, but the digital currency is also exempt from sales tax. \nFurthermore, following the legalization of bitcoin, two major retailers announced their intentions to offer bitcoin as a payment method in their stores. Retail giants Bic Camera and Recruit Lifestyle have both announced that they will trial bitcoin payments in anticipation of a possible increase in the use of bitcoin for consumer purchases. As Recruit Lifestyle uses the point-of-sale app AirREGI, which enables merchants to accept bitcoin payments, there is the potential that over a quarter of a million Japanese retailers may soon accept bitcoin payments before the end of the year. \nGiven that Japan has become a trading hub for bitcoin, the positive news coming out of the country not only boosted local demand but also increased bitcoin buying globally. Traders are likely to be optimistic since its new legitimate status could give the price of bitcoin a substantial boost driven by real demand in the coming months. \nRussia Is Changing Its Stance Toward Bitcoin\nRussia has been a tricky jurisdiction for bitcoin users and startups, as Russia\u2019s central bank, the Bank of Russia, effectively banned the use of digital currencies in 2014 for fear it would undermine the Russian ruble, which was struggling at the time. \nThe bitcoin ban resulted in bitcoin websites being shut down and led to several lawmakers speaking out against the use of digital currencies in Russia, suggesting that they are a vehicle for money laundering and terrorist financing and that they \u201ccannot be used by individuals or legal entities,\u201d according to the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office. \nHowever, at the end of 2016, the sentiment toward bitcoin in Russia started to change. The Russian Federal Tax Service issued a letter in October 2016 that stated that under Russian law digital currencies are not illegal and that there are no prohibitions for citizens or companies when it comes to dealing with them. While this letter was a clear change in sentiment by Russian authorities, it gave no clear indication of how digital currencies will be regulated in Russia. \nLast week, however, Russia\u2019s Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev told Bloomberg in an interview that the Russian central bank and the government are working on a joint position that could see digital currencies such as bitcoin become recognized as a legal payment method as soon as 2018. Meanwhile, his counterpart at the Russian central bank, Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova, stated in February that the authorities intend to decide by mid-2017 whether digital currencies should be considered as cash, an asset or a security. \nRussia\u2019s change in sentiment toward bitcoin has helped to boost the currency\u2019s price and will likely increase its demand in the world\u2019s 11th largest economy, which could potentially push the price of bitcoin to new highs in the months to come.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 20}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nDuring a recent talk at Blockchain Meetup Zurich, Pamela Morgan, who is the CEO of Third Key Solutions and an attorney at Empowered Law PLLC, shared some of her thoughts on Bitcoin, Ethereum and blockchain technology from a legal perspective. While she claimed to often hear that smart contracts are going to replace lawyers, Morgan said she does not believe this will happen; however, she added that lawyers definitely need to pay attention to this space.\n\u201cSmart contracts will not replace lawyers; however, smart contracts will replace lazy lawyers,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cThe real question is: What value is being provided? ... If you\u2019re providing value of filling in a form and you\u2019re using the same form you\u2019ve used for every other client, guess what? Those days are numbered. However, if you\u2019re providing strategy, if you\u2019re understanding the business nuances and the risks, those services are not going to be outsourced \u2014 and certainly not by smart contracts \u2014 anytime soon.\u201d\nAccording to Morgan, Bitcoin and related technologies will affect the practice of law in every possible area. A slide from Morgan\u2019s presentation listed 21 types of law that will be affected by the technology, and one of the specific areas of law she explored in the context of blockchain technology was the use of crypto tokens as an alternative to traditional avenues for public investment.\nWhat Is an Initial Coin Offering?\nThe first area of law explored by Morgan during her talk was initial public offerings (IPOs). An IPO is a type of public offering in which shares of a company are offered to the general public for the first time. There is a large amount of regulation and added costs involved with this process. For example, according to Forbes, underwriters received $51 million when financial data provider Markit Ltd. went public in 2014.\nAn initial coin offering (ICO) is a process by which a percentage of the initial supply in a new digital currency project is offered to the public. It is said that these sorts of offerings require less regulatory hassle because they\u2019re described as software pre-sales rather than public stock offerings, but it\u2019s unclear if this claim is true at this point in time.\nThe Blockchain Doesn\u2019t Shield You From the SEC\n\u201cFor those of you who practice securities law, you are terrified, and you probably should be,\u201d Morgan said about ICOs during her recent talk. \u201cIf anyone is selling these securities to U.S. citizens, you will get in trouble with the SEC for sure. I\u2019m sure there are other jurisdictions that don\u2019t look kindly on this, so this is a developing area of law.\u201d\nEthereum is perhaps the most notable project that was launched via an ICO, of sorts, and it\u2019s unclear whether the SEC will eventually clamp down on this sort of activity. While the Ethereum Foundation contends that ether is a product, rather than a security or investment vehicle, their claim can be open to alternate interpretations.\nMorgan told Bitcoin Magazine that while the ether presale looks less like a security than many of today's ICOs, that doesn\u2019t mean that the SEC will be appeased. \u201cEthereum wouldn't be the first to attempt legal sophistry and semantics to avoid regulation; the SEC takes a dim view of such tactics. If in the eyes of the SEC the Ethereum presale is deemed a security, no disclaimers by the company will deter SEC action.\u201d \n\nConsenSys, which is an incubator of Ethereum projects, has been involved with a number of token offerings on top of the Ethereum platform, and their chief of staff Jeremy Millar recently noted that even they have a fair amount of skepticism of the viability of most of the recently launched ICO projects.\n\u201cThe law cares about how you use these technologies,\u201d Morgan explained during her talk. \u201cIf you use it like a stock, you\u2019re probably going to be regulated as if it\u2019s a stock.\u201d\nDifferentiating Between Scams and Legitimate Projects\nThere have been many scams in the Bitcoin space over the years, and offering some sort of alternative token other than bitcoin is involved with a high percentage of these fraudulent schemes.\nDuring her talk, Morgan explained that many of the bitcoin alternatives on the market have no special value to offer. \u201cSome of them are actually centralized,\u201d she noted. \u201cSome of them are actually pretty close to what I would call a Ponzi scheme. Some of them are offering guaranteed returns. It\u2019s kind of the Wild Wild West out there; it\u2019s kind of a mess.\u201d\nIn Morgan\u2019s view, the best way to tell the difference between a scammy kind of altcoin and one that may offer value is to look at Bitcoin\u2019s and Ethereum\u2019s core characteristics of decentralization, independence, openness and consensus based on proof of work. \u201cThe further you get away from these characteristics, the more you have a chance of being in that dangerous kind of scammy zone,\u201d she added.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 21}

The solution generally shares many of the virtues of hard forks: extension blocks allow for almost any protocol change. But they share one significant benefit with soft forks: extension blocks are backward compatible.\nWell, sort of \u2026\nSoft Forks\nSoft forks are protocol changes that add new rules or tighten up existing ones. \u201cOld nodes\u201d \u2014 as we\u2019ll call them for now \u2014 will consider a soft-forked chain valid because it doesn\u2019t break any \u201cold rules.\u201d This makes soft forks backward compatible: they allow old nodes to coexist on the same network with \u201cnew nodes\u201d that enforce the soft fork.\nWhile soft forks can only add or tighten rules, they can be cleverly used to extend Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities. To do this, soft forks typically utilize special Bitcoin addresses known as \u201canyonecanspend.\u201d (They\u2019re actually \u201coutputs,\u201d not addresses, but for simplicity\u2019s sake ignore that for now.)\nIf these anyonecanspend addresses hold any bitcoins, it means that anyone can spend them; no cryptographic signature or anything else is required \u2026 or so it seems to old nodes.\nBut that\u2019s not what new nodes, enforcing the new rules, see. The new rules prescribe that the bitcoins in these anyonecanspend addresses can only be spent under specific conditions, defined by the soft fork. These new rules can, for example, prescribe that a certain amount of time must have passed (CLTV) or that a signature must be included in a new part of a Bitcoin block (SegWit).\nExtension Blocks\nExtension blocks resemble soft forks, but quite literally take the concept to another level.\nAn extension block itself looks a lot like a normal Bitcoin block, which we\u2019ll call a \u201cbase block.\u201d Like a base block, an extension block mostly includes a bunch of transactions. \nBut there is a difference. A base block is cryptographically linked to the previous base block and to the next base block, chaining all base blocks chronologically to form Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. An extension block, on the other hand, links only to one corresponding base block. Extension blocks \u201cpeg along\u201d base blocks.\nSimilar to most soft forks, extension blocks utilize anyonecanspend addresses. But now, these anyonecanspend addresses act like enter and exit points, to and from the extension blocks.\nWhen a transaction is sent from a base block to an extension block, an old node is tricked. From the perspective of the old node, the coins are sent to a typical anyonecanspend address on the base block. The coins never leave the base block as far as the old node is concerned, and in fact the old node doesn\u2019t even see the extension block.\nBut from the perspective of a new node, the bitcoins are really sent to a whole new address on the extension block \u2014 an \u201cextension address.\u201d This extension address behaves more or less like a normal Bitcoin address.\nInterestingly, these bitcoins can then even start to circulate from extension address to extension address, from one extension block to the next. As such, new nodes see the coins moving around and changing ownership. At the same time, old nodes do not see anything and think the bitcoins are still stuck in the original anyonecanspend address.\nA new node can also send the bitcoins from their extension address back to a normal address on the base block. This is done by tricking old nodes again: from the perspective of the old node, the coins are finally moved from the anyonecanspend address. Only a new node knows where the coins really came from.\nOnce the bitcoins are back in the base block and a normal address, old and new nodes see the same thing.\nAs perhaps the main benefit of extension blocks, they don\u2019t need to adhere to the original Bitcoin protocol in almost any way. This opens up a whole category of new possibilities. The extension blocks can perhaps offer more programmability like Ethereum or Ethereum Classic, or more privacy like Monero, Zcash or Mimblewimble.\nBcoin\u2019s proposal is modest, however: \u201cTo the Moon\u201d extension blocks are mostly just bigger than normal blocks (by a so-far unknown amount), so they can handle more transactions. They also include Segregated Witness, and some added benefits specifically crafted to support the lightning network on top of the extension blocks.\nComplexity\nWhile extension blocks in general, and To the Moon in particular, can work technically, they do present some drawbacks.\nAt the heart of these drawbacks, To the Moon is more technically complex than other scaling solutions proposed so far, including all hard forks as well as a Segregated Witness soft fork. This also makes them more complicated to implement.\nAnd from a user perspective, To the Moon would leave old nodes in the dark more than most soft forks do. While old nodes don\u2019t know how coins on soft-forked anyonecanspend addresses can be spent, with extension blocks, old nodes don\u2019t even know where coins are. This means that old nodes can\u2019t trace the history of a coin and perhaps in some cases temporarily can\u2019t even spend it. (This could be the case if a blockchain reorganization takes place; this can cosmetically change what a transaction from an extension block to an old node looks like.)\nAs such, not everyone loves To the Moon. Johnson Lau, the original proposer of extension blocks, argues that To the Moon \u201cfailed to meet the very important requirement of a softfork: backward compatibility.\u201d He instead still considers extension blocks \u201cmore as an academic topic than something really ready for production use.\u201d Similarly, Bitcoin Core developer and Bitcoin Knots maintainer Luke Dashjr warns that extension blocks \u201care a risk of creating two classes of \u2018full nodes,\u2019\" where non-upgraded nodes are \"left\u00a0insecure like pseudo-SPV (not even real SPV) nodes.\u201d And Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo dismisses the idea that extension blocks should be considered opt-in at all \u2014 instead \u201cthe entire network is forced to trust the extension block,\u201d a \u201cpretty terrible precedent.\u201d\nFor more discussion on To the Moon, see the Bitcoin-development mailing list.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 20}

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nAlthough the scaling and block size debate continues, this week the bigger focus has been on the halting of withdrawals and deposits of USD from various bitcoin exchanges, most notably Bitfinex and OKCoin. Many of the exchanges are still able to process USD, but are having a harder and harder time doing so due to an unfriendly regulatory milieu. Further explanation and breakdown of the restrictions can be found here.\nDespite all of this, the bitcoin price has continued to rise this week with divergences in price among all the USD exchanges. \n\nAt present, there is a $57 differential between Bitfinex and Bitstamp, which is unusually high. Normally, large price differences are smoothed over through arbitraging, when an asset is bought or sold on one exchange and bought or sold on another exchange for profit. When arbitraging does not occur, or is unable to equalize the price, there is likely an artificial supply or demand bottleneck accounting for the differential. \nKnowing that Bitfinex is having trouble processing USD means that in order to leave the exchange, you must first buy a digital currency and move the money off. For most people, this is just easier than dealing with the current USD restrictions. \nAlthough it\u2019s unlikely the bullish move is entirely due to users exiting the exchange, it likely plays a role and may partly explain why Bitfinex\u2019s price is so much higher than the other exchanges. \nThe other unknown is why Bitstamp\u2019s price is running so much lower than all the other exchanges. GDAX, a regulated U.S. bitcoin, ether and litecoin exchange, probably has the fewest USD supply/demand variables because of the ease with which they are able to process USD. If USD held per exchange was viewable, this would help assuage the concerns that exchanges may choose to halt the USD trading pairs entirely, but this metric is likely not available to the public. \nAll of this occurs in a Core vs. Unlimited stalemate. Miner and node support has remained essentially unchanged since last week. Node support for the SegWit user-activated soft fork (UASF) has remained unchanged as well. \n\n\n\nOn higher time frames, the USD exchanges are currently showing a bullish MACD (moving average convergence divergence) cross on the histogram, which has historically been a bullish entry signal in the current trend. \n\nBitfinex\n\nBTC-e\n\nGDAX\n\nBitstamp\nMACD is a momentum oscillator, similar to RSI (relative strength index). The MACD histogram measures the distance between the MACD line (blue) and the signal line (white). Since the trend began in 2015, these lines have essentially stayed above 0 and have crossed and recrossed several times. Prior crosses on Bitfinex have yielded the following from cross to price peak:\n09/25/15 \u2014 +115 percent\n11/14/15 \u2014 +45 percent\n02/02/16 \u2014 0 percent\n04/13/16 \u2014 +12 percent\n05/25/16 \u2014 +76 percent\n09/07/16 \u2014 0 percent\n09/28/16 \u2014 +93 percent\n02/01/17 \u2014 +36 percent\nAverage \u2014 +47 percent\nEven with a high time frame MACD cross, price remains range bound until it is able to break the previous ATH. \n\nThere are two potentially active bullish chart patterns, the cup and handle and the inverted head and shoulders, with measured moves of ~$1,550\u20131,600. \n\n\nThe shapes of both patterns are admittedly far from textbook but follow all the necessary rules of the patterns, mainly a descending volume profile. Expect a large spike in bullish volume once price breaks the horizontal resistance to confirm the breakout for both patterns. \nLastly, like it or not, the price of gold remains a very real resistance target for bitcoin. \n\nSummary\nSeveral Bitcoin exchanges have halted USD deposits and withdrawals but are still processing digital currency as normal. These exchanges also have other avenues to deposit and withdraw in several other currencies. Miner and node support for both SegWit and Bitcoin Unlimited (BTU) has remained largely unchanged since last week.A high time frame momentum oscillator has turned bullish. The average yield for this has been 47 percent since the beginning of the trend in 2015. A confirmation of two bullish chart patterns with a high volume breakout above horizontal resistance will suggest a target of $1,550\u20131,590 in the coming weeks. \n", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 20}

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nEthereum (ETH) continues to easily hold the number-two market capitalization, far and above the next highest altcoins. Its volume traded, however, is quite handily surpassed by Bitcoin, and its only trading volume rival at the moment is Litecoin. \u00a0\n\nMining hash rate continues to push all-time highs almost daily, a strong sign that miners, at least, believe in the short- to medium-term future of Ethereum.\n\nTo tease apart Ethereum\u2019s volume traded a bit further, we must look at both ETH/BTC and ETH/USD. The BTC pair leads the traded volume by far. \n\nETH/BTC is mainly traded on Poloniex, and ETH/USD is split among xBTCe, Bitfinex and GDAX. \n\n\n\nFor the most part, markets generally move based on the exchange where the volume is the highest. For traders, this suggests that ETH/BTC and signals from Poloniex should be weighted the heaviest when making trading decisions. Regarding ETH/USD, it should also be noted that the exchange price essentially hovers around $49, except on Bitfinex, where it sits $3 higher at $52. This higher rate should not suggest that there are more bullish traders on Bitfinex, rather that it is a byproduct of Bitfinex having trouble processing USD deposits and withdrawals. In order to move fiat funds out of the exchange, traders must first buy ETH or another digital currency. This extra step creates artificial demand pressure, thus raising the price slightly compared to other exchanges. \u00a0\nBitfinex\u2019s ETH/BTC pair is currently in line with the other exchanges, which is to be expected considering they are having no problem handling ETH or BTC deposits and withdrawals. \nThe remainder of the article will focus on the Poloniex ETH/BTC pair converted to Bitcoin\u2019s current price ($1,240) in USD. \nThe prevailing chart pattern, with a messy descending volume profile, is the bearish head-and-shoulders reversal. \n\nMore important is the zone between $43.40 and $38.44 (0.035 and 0.031), which has seen strong support since it was broken on March 16. Should price close below this zone, it would suggest a reach for the next support, or $28.14 (0.0227). This would likely occur quickly, not only as part of the measured move of the head-and-shoulders completion, but because there is no immediate market memory of support from the move up. \u00a0\nThe 50/200 EMA cross on the daily time frame remains heavily bullish. For many traders, so long as the price is above the 200-day moving average, the trend is considered bullish. However, a growing distance between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages may suggest overbought market conditions. The probability of pullback or a sideways trend in price is much greater than bullish continuation.\n\nShould price close below the 50 EMA, it\u2019s reasonable to expect it to reach for the 200 EMA, currently sitting at the same key level as the head-and-shoulders target of $28.14 (0.0227). \u00a0\nThe 50/200 EMA cross on the four-hour time frame remains bullish, and has been so since the cross on February 25, 2017. \n\nA 200 EMA over 50 EMA cross would be a strong long-exit signal as well as a sell or short entry signal.\nThe 50/200 EMA on the one-hour chart will cross bearish soon, also a sell or short entry signal. \n\nLastly, on the daily time frame, Heikin-Ashi candlesticks, which measure momentum, are beginning to show bearish movement (red) with size. A break of the head-and-shoulders horizontal support with several large bearish Heikin-Ashi candles should be seen as bearish confluence and give further confidence in a sell or short entry signal. \n\nSummary\n\nETH altcoin dominance continues with no true rivals in market cap or volume traded. The ETH/BTC pair on Poloniex drives most of the Ethereum trading volume, thus the price. A large bearish reversal chart pattern has formed. A break of the key horizontal supports is a strong short-entry signal. The 50/200 EMA crosses on lower time frames are flipping bearish. The 200 EMA at ~$28 should act as support and as the ultimate target for a large down move. ", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 21}

The system would allow for the collection, transfer and storage of trade data and statistics provided by each member country.\nThe Kimberley Process is a certification scheme established in 2003 by a United Nations resolution following a series of reports that first exposed the link between the diamond trade and the financing of conflicts. Currently, 81 countries are members of the Kimberley Process. These members ensure that more than 99 percent of diamonds are from conflict-free sources.\nIn 2016, the UAE led the Kimberley Process and nominated Ahmed Bin Sulayem, the executive chairman of the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), to chair the global initiative.\nAccording to James Bernard, the director of business development for the DMCC, a permissioned blockchain can both revolutionize diamond trading and critically reduce costs across the trading spectrum. \u00a0\u00a0\nBernard, who is also one of the founding members of the GBC as well as the DMCC Blockchain Innovation Group, believes that the technology can help combat, if not eradicate, the illicit practice of using diamonds to finance criminal activities. \nIn a report released in March, Bernard explained: \n\u201cUsing blockchain [technology] means we can centralize and secure the collection of all data. Today, diamond production and trade data is mostly manually transferred to a central website. Blockchain technology can be used to automate this process and to share a ledger across the member network.\u201d \nThe network will be private to the parties concerned and only authorized parties will be allowed to join. It will be secured using cryptographic technology to ensure that participants see only what they are allowed to see. Diamond data will be collected and added by authorized users and immediately visible to everyone across the network. \n\u201cThis establishes trust, accountability and transparency while streamlining the process,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cIt has the potential to vastly reduce the cost and complexity of the processes involved.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nNumerous government departments, regulators and corporations in Dubai are exploring how blockchain technology can align with and help to advance the UAE\u2019s ambitious development agendas.\nIn March, the Smart Dubai Office, a government body responsible for implementing innovative technologies in the UAE, officially launched a citywide implementation of blockchain technology. The bureau selected IBM and blockchain software technology company Consensus Systems (ConsenSys) as partners in the program. \nThe platform, which will be developed in conjunction with the two partners, will underpin Dubai\u2019s Blockchain Strategy, an initiative announced last year that aims to turn Dubai into the \u201cfirst blockchain-powered government in the world by 2020.\u201d\n\u201cCollaborating with IBM and ConsenSys will help expedite this process, attaining Smart Dubai\u2019s overall vision of making everyday experiences more safe, seamless, efficient and impactful for all residents and visitors of the city,\u201d said Aisha Bin Bishr, the general director of the Smart Dubai Office. \u00a0\nAs part of the project, the government will begin to look at a new regulatory framework for blockchain technology. \u201cThis is part of our plan. Certainly, our current regulatory framework does not capture such nascent technologies like blockchain, so we need to work out how to either amend existing regulations, or introduce new ones,\u201d said Bin Bishr. \nSpeaking at the press conference, Wesam Lootah, CEO of the Smart Dubai Government Establishment, stated that the government was \u201ctaking the lead in making Dubai the premiere hub when it comes to blockchain [technology].\u201d \nSmart Dubai will organize workshops on the use of blockchain technology with government, semi-government and private organizations in Dubai. The bureau expects several pilot projects to be launched in the coming months, starting with a project by the Dubai Land Department, Dubai Municipality, Dewa and the Department of Naturalisation and Residency Dubai, Bin Bishr told The National.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 18}

While many may think it\u2019s a long way from mainstream adoption, others are of the opinion that Bitcoin\u2019s distributed ledger could change the world as we know it.\nDelving into how the blockchain ecosystem can shape our future is Swiss-born economist and filmmaker Manuel Stagars, who filmed the recently streamed eight-part documentary \"The Blockchain and Us.\" In conversations with blockchain experts, scientists, entrepreneurs, corporate decision makers, politicians, investors and others from around the world, Stagars takes the viewer on a journey, portraying the technology away from the hype, making it accessible and starting a conversation about its potential.\nStagars, who has published books and scientific articles on startups, marketplace lending, impact investing, data quality and Open Data, opens his film referencing the Wright Brothers and how they invented the airplane in 1903. Nearly 115 years ago, it was hard to imagine that today there would be over 500,000 people traveling by air at any one time to various destinations. Fast-forward to 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin and blockchain technology. For the first time, this inventor made it possible to send and receive money anywhere in the world without the involvement of banks or middlemen.\n\u201cJust like the Wright Brothers, [Satoshi] solved an unsolvable problem,\u201d said Stagars. \u201cDespite its mysterious beginnings, the blockchain might be the aeroplane of our time.\u201d\nIn the first 40 years of the internet we have seen social media, email, online shopping, cloud computing, mobile applications, the Internet of Things, Big Data and Open Data. It\u2019s almost impossible for an individual to get through a day without some form of information technology, and yet while this is the case, the internet still lacks one component: trust. Blockchain technology solves this issue.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Stagars said that he thinks the blockchain is one of those technologies that has the potential to transform industries, governments, and the way we live together in the future, much faster than we can imagine.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the early stages, and there will be some trial and error until we see the real long-term impacts,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is part of this bigger movement of \u2018digital transformation,\u2019 where processes in general become decentralized and democratized with new and unexpected business models emerging.\u201d\nHe added that, while this could be the main challenge, it\u2019s also the main opportunity of the next decades, maybe even of our lives.\nOf course, while blockchain technology is being touted as a game changer, the financial sector doesn\u2019t appear to be as enthusiastic about its potential. A report in March from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) found that only 25 percent of surveyed executives believe that the technology will impact their business models within the next two years.\nHowever, while banks are turning their attention to blockchain technology, Caitlin Long, chairman of the board and president of Symbiont, states in the film that banks aren\u2019t going to rush out and do anything reckless with people\u2019s money with the technology.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to take a long time for [blockchain technology] to weave its way into the system,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, I think within 20 years the financial services will be just software, and the smart contracts technology, in particular, is going to automate a lot of things that institutions and people handle today.\u201d\nHowever, while the financial services industry may have been the first sector to consider blockchain technology, it also has wider applications in other industries and is already helping to change many societies, including the unbanked population.\nAccording to the World Bank, there are two billion unbanked people around the world. Countries such as the U.S. also have a high percentage of unbanked people.\n\u201cIn the U.S., one of the wealthiest countries in the world, about 50 percent of the population doesn\u2019t have access to basic financial services, including bank accounts,\u201d Perianne Boring, founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, said in another interview segment.\nThrough blockchain technology, disenfranchised people are enjoying what so many of us take for granted: money that can be sent from and received in an account.\nEven though the documentary provides no explanation of the technology, the conversations throughout deliver an optimistic and meaningful approach to the future of blockchain technology and how it can improve the lives of everyone.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much innovation that blockchain technology has spurred all throughout the world, and I have no doubt in my mind that this technology is going to affect everybody,\u201d concluded Boring. \u201cI would say in ten, twenty years\u2019 time, there won\u2019t be a human being whose life is not impacted by this technology.\u201d\nImage (c) Manuel Stagars, \"The Blockchain and Us,\" www.blockchain-documentary.com\n", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 21}

He has reported on technology, business, the arts and more for newsrooms around the United States.\nAs Bitcoin is adopted by more users every day, the need to determine how it can integrate into mainstream society becomes even more pressing. One major question continues to be how traditional laws apply to Bitcoin and its use.\nMany of those determinations could have major implications for Bitcoin and its holders, and few will play a bigger role in the United States than property laws, which could ultimately govern ownership over the digital currency.\nA new white paper, \u201cTreatment of Bitcoin Under U.S. Property Law,\u201d seeks to analyze how the worlds of digital currency and property law should intersect. The report was assembled by Perkins Coie, an international law firm that specializes in blockchain technology and digital currency and has been active in the space since 2013. While detailed and clearly well-researched, the paper\u2019s foremost conclusion is straightforward and transparent.\n\u201cWe conclude that property interests should exist in bitcoin under such law, and that multiple sources of persuasive authority provide additional support for that conclusion,\u201d the paper\u2019s authors, J. Dax Hansen and Joshua L. Boehm, wrote.\nThe paper begins with an overview of Bitcoin\u2019s technological attributes and what those mean for how property law can apply to it. Using California state law as a benchmark and Bitcoin transactions as an example, the authors make their case.\n\u201cParties may ... enter into contractual arrangements in which one party entrusts partial or complete control of such private key(s) to a third party while still maintaining formal title to the bitcoin value represented in applicable [unspent transaction outputs],\u201d the paper reads. \u201cThese kinds of contractual arrangements are commonplace in custodial, trust, and escrow settings, which have generated well-developed legal principles that should generally translate to bitcoin custodial contexts.\u201d\nThe paper dissects academic articles from some of the country\u2019s foremost law professors, who also, for the most part, support the idea that intangible property rights should apply to Bitcoin:\n\u201cProperty law scholars who have encountered the bitcoin ownership issues in the context of broader, more theoretical undertakings have reached (or assumed) the same general conclusion ... that is, interests in bitcoin should be protected by property law.\u201d\nThe authors move on to describe how Bitcoin has been treated by other legal divisions, such as commodities and taxation laws, citing the fact that in court opinions and regulatory guidance under these specialties, the digital currency has been treated as property.\n\u201cAlthough the concept of \u2018property\u2019 is fundamentally a matter of state law in the United States, it is also important that bitcoin has been widely treated as (or assumed to be) property for purposes of other state and federal statutory regimes,\u201d reads the paper. \u201cThese treatments and assumptions have already had substantial consequences for the bitcoin sector. They therefore constitute informal but persuasive legal precedent further indicating that bitcoin can be owned as property.\u201d\nIn an acknowledgment that much is still to be determined around how U.S. laws govern Bitcoin, the authors also included a section looking at the challenges to treating the digital currency as legal property. These include the multisignature arrangements, pseudoanonymity and potential lack of traceability associated with the Bitcoin platform. However, the authors remain optimistic that these challenges can be overcome as the technology develops.\n\u201cTo be sure, difficulties in tracing ownership of particular bitcoin units across successive owners could cause some challenges in certain commercial use cases,\u201d they wrote, but \u201cblockchain technology itself has enabled, and will likely continue to enable, solutions to obstacles that do arise.\u201d\nIt does appear that the worlds of Bitcoin and formal legal precedent are rapidly coming to a head. As the turning point approaches, familiarity with relevant legal precedent will be crucial.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 21}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nOver the past couple of years, a Bitcoin-powered mobile application developed by Seattle-based blockchain adtech and payments company CakeCodes has quietly amassed 250,000 active monthly users. The Android app BitMaker incentivizes users to engage with other mobile applications, such as freemium games, in an effort to get the user to download the app. BitMaker users are rewarded for trying out the apps and filling out forms found on traditional survey sites, with payouts made in either bitcoin or ether.\nBitcoin Magazine recently reached out to CakeCodes CEO Simon Yu to get more details on BitMaker\u2019s success, how this Android app works, why they use bitcoin and how they plan to expand their operations in the future.\nHow Does It Work?\nThe point of BitMaker is to get users to try out other mobile applications or fill out forms for free trials of various products or services. It\u2019s sort of a form of advertising where the viewer of the ad also gets paid in the process, which is something Brave is working on with their Bitcoin-enabled browser as well.\nWhen tasks are completed in BitMaker, users are rewarded with in-app tokens known as Blocks. These \u201cBlocks\u201d can then be converted into bitcoin or ether once a certain threshold has been met.\nUsers are able to view an engaging advertisement once every 30 minutes, for which they are paid roughly $0.002 worth of Blocks. One of the advertisements tested by Bitcoin Magazine was more of a quick trial of a mobile game rather than a promotional video that is simply watched.\nIn addition to the simpler advertisements, there are standalone tasks that involve a bit more work, such as downloading a freemium game or signing up for a free trial of Hooked on Phonics. These tasks can pay out more than a couple of dollars\u2019 worth of Blocks each.\n\u201cTraditional advertising methods include pushing unsolicited ads onto people,\u201d said Yu. \u201cWe wanted to combat this by giving consumers the option to opt in and get paid for their time used on trying a new product. With BitMaker, end users get paid, businesses only pay upon engagement, and customer acquisition costs are dramatically decreased. Everyone wins. What we\u2019ve done is create a simple, fun way for consumers to be rewarded for trying cool new products.\u201d\n\u201cWe are able to understand what the customer needs because we\u2019re also the audience: our team is made of app developers and gamers,\u201d said Calvin Hsieh, who is the founder and CTO of CakeCodes. \u201cThat\u2019s why we crafted our app based off the mechanisms behind popular role-playing games, including World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy. While playing, gamers are rewarded for completing a mission for items like digital swords or in-game gold. We made this experience tangible by tying it to the real world; when a user completes a mission on our app, they receive real money. After 700,000 installs, we are proud to state that our business model works.\u201d\nPayouts Made via Bitcoin and Ethereum\nOf course, BitMaker is not the first platform that allows people to get paid for essentially signing up for free trials of products or services. These sorts of survey sites have existed since the early days of the internet.\nThe key difference here is the focus on Bitcoin throughout the application. In fact, BitMaker\u2019s logo really isn\u2019t much different from the classic orange-and-white Bitcoin logo.\n\u201cBitcoin and cryptocurrency are more exciting to attain than a $1 gift card, which you just pick up at the store next door,\u201d said Yu when asked why BitMaker does not use gift cards for payouts, which are a common choice on other similar platforms. \u201cThe exciting part about bitcoin is that it could triple in a month; it\u2019s like owning a piece of stock and there\u2019s a thrill aspect.\u201d\nThe focus on the excitement around the bitcoin price in the app is real. Users will sometimes receive notifications on their phone about the price of bitcoin or ether from the app.\n\u201cFor people not familiar with crypto, there\u2019s generally two ways to acquire bitcoins, which is to mine (too complicated for the average person) or risk your money buying it,\u201d Yu continued. \u201cBut the average person who isn\u2019t familiar oftentimes associates Bitcoin with either Silk Road or exchanges being hacked and don\u2019t want to risk their money. BitMaker allows anyone to try earning their first bitcoin through us, risk free.\u201d\nYu added that the BitMaker business model also wouldn\u2019t work on traditional payment rails. \u201cAs we are a micro-payments business, utilizing blockchain technology enables us to pay almost no fees for sending 15,000+ payments around the world a week,\u201d Yu said. \u201cWith PayPal or a standard medium it\u2019d cost us a $0.30 transaction fee in addition to a percentage point on each transaction. If we did this, we wouldn\u2019t have a business model.\u201d\nAccording to the BitMaker website, the app has paid out over 215 bitcoin and 34 ether up to this point. This amounts to over $275,000 worth of payouts at current exchange rates.\nThere are four total payout options available on BitMaker right now: Bitcoin, Coinbase, Xapo and Ethereum. Due to increased U.S. dollar denominated transaction fees on the Bitcoin network over the past year, Coinbase, Xapo and Ethereum withdrawals can be made at lower thresholds.\nPassing on an ICO for Traditional Equity Crowdfunding\nAccording to Yu, CakeCodes has not closed the door on an ICO yet, but he also pointed out some potential drawbacks associated with that particular model.\n\u201cAlthough ICOs seem to be the more popular way to attain startup capital for blockchain companies, we\u2019ve seen what happened to the companies who didn\u2019t raise enough capital from an unsuccessful ICO,\u201d Yu said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big risk of having our token out there and not being able to raise future rounds if we don\u2019t succeed. Our vision is to disrupt advertising the way Airbnb disrupted hotels; we allow users to be paid for their time spent on viewing ads. We made this decision to put us in a better position for the future.\u201d\nCakeCodes intends to use the money from the Wefunder campaign to increase user growth, fast track development for an iOS app and add new features to the Android app.\nUpdate: On April 28, a CakeCodes representative alerted us to an SEC request to remove the launch date from the Wefunder site. This article has also since removed the link to the campaign.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 21}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nOn the most recent episode of \u201cEpicenter,\u201d co-hosts Brian Fabian Crain and S\u00e9bastien Couture interviewed Thomas Voegtlin, a developer of the bitcoin wallet Electrum. During the interview, Voegtlin shared his thoughts on Bitcoin Unlimited, an alternative to Bitcoin Core that is best known for a feature allowing miners and full nodes to set a locally acceptable block size limit.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [Bitcoin Unlimited] is a good idea,\u201d Voegtlin said during the interview. \u201cIt\u2019s really a big change; it\u2019s a change in the structure of power in Bitcoin. It\u2019s a very risky hard fork.\u201d He went on to suggest that since the recent AsicBoost scandal, \u201ca lot of people have changed their mind on this\u201d and no longer support Bitcoin Unlimited.\nVoegtlin went on to explain his view that Bitcoin Unlimited would give more power to miners and how the software client has diverged greatly from Bitcoin Core. The Electrum developer also touched on the similarities between the Bitcoin and Litecoin codebases.\nMore Power for Bitcoin Miners?\nAlthough Voegtlin claimed Bitcoin Unlimited is not much of a topic of discussion anymore, he also pointed out that a large percentage of the network hashrate (around 39 percent at the time of this writing) is still signaling support for the alternative software client.\n\u201cWe are in a situation where miners have a lot of power, and they seem to want more,\u201d Voegtlin said of the support of Bitcoin Unlimited among miners. \u201cThat\u2019s the point of Bitcoin Unlimited: the miners decide to change the rules whenever they want, and the only requirement is that they are followed by other miners.\u201d\nVoegtlin went on to note that he\u2019s unsure how many of the miners signaling support for Bitcoin Unlimited really want any of the changes implemented in the alternative software client to activate on the Bitcoin network. \u201cThey are signaling their opposition to [Segregated Witness],\u201d Voegtlin said.\nIn regard to miners\u2019 reasoning for rejecting Segregated Witness (SegWit), Voegtlin pointed to the recent AsicBoost revelations involving Bitmain as a theory.\nLater, Voegtlin pointed to miners wanting to see more transactions processed on chain rather than through off-chain channels, such as the lightning network, as another plausible theory. \u201cBut today it\u2019s impossible to put numbers on that,\u201d Voegtlin added. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to quantify this.\u201d\nBitcoin Unlimited Has Completely Diverged from Bitcoin Core\nAnother issue Voegtlin sees with Bitcoin Unlimited is that it has completely diverged from the Bitcoin Core codebase.\n\u201cThe team of developers that are behind Bitcoin Unlimited actually did not create a patch of the project, but they forked it a long time ago,\u201d explained Voegtlin. \u201cThe version of Bitcoin that they maintain is now completely different. They have diverged, which is not a good idea.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good idea to fork the project if you want to replace the developers, if you want to fire them,\u201d Voegtlin added.\nIn Voegtlin\u2019s view, the developers behind Bitcoin Unlimited should have created a simple patch and rebased it on top of the Bitcoin Core codebase after each new release.\nSimilarities Between the Bitcoin and Litecoin Codebases\nNear the end of the interview, Voegtlin pointed out that the Bitcoin and Litecoin codebases are very similar. It is partially for this reason that others, such as Bloq Co-Founder Jeff Garzik and Coinbase Director of Engineering Charlie Lee, have noted that Litecoin could provide a valuable test environment for SegWit and the lightning network.\n\u201cLitecoin is very close to Bitcoin; the changes are very small,\u201d Voegtlin explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Bitcoin Unlimited, who decided to drop the project and discard all of the new developments from the [Bitcoin] Core developers. Litecoin is just a small patch over Bitcoin, so the developments that are made for Litecoin can benefit Bitcoin.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 22}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe Bitcoin Core project, launched by Satoshi Nakamoto eight years ago and today led by Wladimir van der Laan, aims to release a new major release of the software about once every six months. Such a release (0.12.0, 0.13.0, 0.14.0\u2026) includes most of the improvements made since the last major release.\nIn between major releases, the Bitcoin Core project often offers minor releases (0.12.1, 0.13.1, 0.13.2\u2026). These either include soft fork upgrades, which are included in minor releases to make opting out as easy as possible. Or they include bug fixes and other modest improvements. \nThis weekend marks the official release of a new minor release: Bitcoin Core 0.14.1. \nHere\u2019s what the newest iteration of the first most-used Bitcoin implementation has to offer.\nSegWit Signaling\nPerhaps the most noteworthy change in the new release affects miners, and in particular concerns Segregated Witness (SegWit), the protocol upgrade at the heart of Bitcoin Core\u2019s scaling roadmap. \nSegregated Witness is a soft fork, which means that non-upgraded nodes will remain part of the same network as upgraded nodes. This is technically also true for miners; they can continue to mine blocks without including any SegWit transactions if they so choose. (Though, if they do not upgrade at all, they may want to take some precautions to avoid mining on top of invalid blocks.)\nBitcoin Core 0.14.1 now also offers miners the option to exclude any Segregated Witness transactions even if the soft fork activates. They can continue to mine blocks that only include \u201cold style\u201d transactions if they prefer.\nAdditionally, Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 miners that prefer to exclude SegWit transactions will, by default, still signal support for the upgrade regardless. After all, SegWit activation shouldn\u2019t really be a problem for them: With Bitcoin Core 0.14.1, they are technically ready to avoid invalid blocks, and they can themselves create blocks without SegWit transactions all the same.\nMemory Accounting\nFor normal, non-mining users, the biggest change in Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 is probably an improvement in memory use.\nBitcoin nodes keep a buffer of recent changes to the state of the blockchain (the \u201cUTXO-set\u201d) in memory. Recent changes are most likely to change again, and keeping this in memory lets nodes access it as fast as possible. This way, nodes can accept and validate transactions and blocks rapidly, and forward them accordingly, thereby benefiting the whole network. Once in a while, the current state of the UTXO-set is \u201cflushed\u201d: This is when the data is stored on disc more permanently.\nBitcoin Core 0.14.0 showed some problems estimating how much headroom is needed in memory to perform this flush. This could have detrimental effects on low-end systems in particular, like some Raspberry Pi\u2019s, and other computers with limited memory. In Bitcoin Core 0.14.1, memory usage for the UTXO-set is calculated more accurately, which should help well-configured machines run more smoothly.\nAdditionally, Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 includes a number of smaller bug fixes and optimisations.\nThe next major release, Bitcoin Core 0.15.0, is expected around autumn of this year.\nFor more information, see the Bitcoin Core 0.14.1 release notes.

According to Agrello, their solution will allow individuals and businesses to use smart contracts as a substitute for and enhancement to standard paper contracts.\nSpeaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Co-founder and CEO of Agrello Hando Rand described his path from doing early research on what had not yet been termed \u201csmart contracts\u201d at Tallum University of Technology. He was \u201cblown away\u201d when Ethereum was first announced as he realized that blockchain technology could be the means for his work to become reality.\nRand said of the choice to build on Qtum that his team has been \u201csearching for over a year to find a blockchain platform that would fit our needs. Qtum allows us to build a mobile-compatible and scalable smart contract solution, and hence is our technology of choice.\u201d\nQtum Co-Founder and CEO Patrick Das weighed in on the news to Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cQtum aims to build the first POS smart contract platform that is mobile supported; we welcome more and more startups to build applications on Qtum platform in the future.\u201d\nThe professional legal view of smart contract technology and its potential applications in the field trends positive, and several U.S. states have passed regulations confirming smart contract applications over the last year, while formally defining what they deem smart contracts to be. \nIn 2016 the state of Vermont passed a law providing that a blockchain-based digital record will be considered a business record under the Vermont Rules of Evidence; just this April the state of Arizona passed a law confirming that smart contracts managed on the blockchain are considered electronic records. The Arizona law defines smart contracts as an \u201cevent driven program, with state, that runs on a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger that can take custody over and instruct transfer of assets on that ledger.\u201d\nAgrello\u2019s AI smart contract interface corresponds with Qtum\u2019s Smart Contract Lifecycle Management solution, detailed in Qtum\u2019s whitepaper, which proposes a workflow to derive smart contract code from human-readable agreements and manage them in real time.The Qtum project, with management support from PWC, raised $15.6 million this March, and plans for its platform to be ready for public use in Q3 of this year.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 22}

Its goal is to create a trading platform that satisfies customer demands for a more rapid, cost-effective and secure means of purchasing, storing and selling gold. \nIn addition, Blockchain security company BitGo has been collaborating with CME Group in developing the architecture, rules and parameters of the blockchain. The multi-signature wallet technology BitGo currently uses for its current client base will be the foundational security protocol for RMG. This is generally regarded as the safest way to deal with digital assets like gold. Developers, business and research are able to now access the code for evaluation and testing purposes. \nThe release of the open source code ahead of the launch is critical to the effectiveness of this distributed ledger technology. As a permissioned private network, allowances will be made for some of the source code to be enhanced and modified. \nAll of this highlights the value of blockchain technology in revolutionizing the way in which digital transactions are facilitated. From banking to healthcare to land title management, and now to gold, blockchains are poised to boost the efficiency of a broad range of functions. \nSteven J. Ehrlich, associate at Spitzberg Partners LLC, a New York-based consultancy that assists clients in developing and executing market entry and M&A strategies says it\u2019s very exciting to hear that the RMG project is moving forward following the initial announcement last year. \n\u201cTraders and institutional investors have long been frustrated with the high fees, lack of transparency, and counterparty risks that come with trading gold. So key players no doubt will be interested in any technology that is secure and makes their lives easier,\u201d says Ehrlich.\nHe says that from the start of this project, it has been apparent that the implementation has been designed with the intent to quickly, but responsibly, go into production in an effort to validate the applicability of blockchain technology to gold markets. Ehrlich notes that the fact that the project is being run by the Royal Mint adds a degree of control over the project since it will operate on a closed network, issue all RMG tokens, and vault the gold. Additionally, he says, the teams at BitGo, CME Group, and AlphaPoint are reputable brands within the industry, which adds to the legitimacy of the project. \u00a0\nEhrlich is also pleased to see that the participants are open sourcing the code, especially given that it makes sense to run this initial implementation as a closed network. \u00a0This, he says, will not only add to the security of the network, but can also help promote interoperability moving forward. \n\u201cI hope that the companies involved will share some of the key lessons learned during the testing phase and once it goes live, as there is no better way to learn than \u201cby doing.\u201d These insights will prove invaluable to other developers, institutional investors, mints, et cetera, who are interest[ed] in exploring the applicability of blockchain technology to their operations.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 24}

While some have claimed these perceived issues are extremely detrimental to the adoption of Bitcoin in developing countries, Bitwala CEO J\u00f6rg von Minckwitz told Bitcoin Magazine that this is not necessarily true.\nBitwala is a Bitcoin-focused international money transfer startup that also aims to provide blockchain-based banking services that are accessible to anyone on any part of the planet.\nAccording to Minckwitz, the changes in the Bitcoin network over the past year have not had much effect on the particular types of use cases that have become popular on the African continent. Bitwala as a company also likes Bitcoin as it exists today, although they believe off-chain solutions such as the lightning network are the right path forward in terms of future improvements to the network.\nWhat Is Bitcoin Used for in Africa?\nAccording to Minckwitz, North Africa is the most popular region of the continent when it comes to new signups and website visits; however, the Bitcoin startup is also seeing a daily rise in signups and generally increased interest from users in other areas.\nAccording to data recently released by Bitwala, 30 percent of their new signups are coming from a combination of Africa and South East Asia.\n\u201cBitcoin is also becoming very popular in Sub-Saharan and East Africa where it fills the need to serve underbanked communities and where the cryptocurrency steps in place of sometimes absent currencies,\u201d Minckwitz said.\nMinckwitz went on to claim that Bitwala has seen a lot of businesses, especially in Nigeria, that utilize bitcoin to provide bank-like services such as offering loans.\n\u201cBitwala has emerged to fill the gap left by money transfer intermediaries and banks when it comes to cheaper and faster international transfers,\u201d Minckwitz said. \u201cAlthough we cannot tell for sure, judging by the amounts transferred, people in Africa are using Bitwala for sending money to friends and family, but business-like transactions are also on the rise.\u201d\nIn a past interview with CoinJournal, Kenya-based fintech blogger Michael Kimani shared similar statements, noting the use of Bitcoin for filling the gaps between the various online payment systems in the country.\nBitcoin\u2019s Network Congestion Not Causing Problems in Africa\nWhen asked if Bitwala has been negatively affected by higher fees and longer confirmation times on the Bitcoin network, Minckwitz bluntly responded, \u201cTo be honest, no.\n\u201cWe like Bitcoin as it is and we don\u2019t see higher fees as a threat,\u201d Minckwitz continued. \u201cHigher fees make companies [optimize] their payment flows. Many transactions of a day-to-day life don\u2019t need to be settled on chain. With higher fees, the spam (useless transactions) on chain gets reduced, which is in our opinion a good thing. Bitcoin was not meant to be a payment network. It is the value that the payment network should carry.\u201d\nSome in the Bitcoin community would dispute the claim that the P2P digital cash system was never meant to be a payment network. After all, the introduction of the Bitcoin white paper discusses the need for an \u201celectronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.\u201d\nHaving said that, the earliest of adopters, such as cypherpunk Hal Finney, who received the first-ever bitcoin transaction from Satoshi Nakamoto, have also noted the digital commodity\u2019s gold-esque properties, which could signify its importance as a store of value.\nIn Minckwitz\u2019s view, the bigger Bitcoin companies should settle their bitcoin payments in a manner similar to how traditional banks work today, at least for now. \u201cThey calculate their debt or balance during the day and once a day they do one transfer instead of hundreds back and forth all day long,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cI think it all comes down to the perspective,\u201d Minckwitz continued. \u201cWhen you take a look at the current system in Africa, it is way worse than Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees. When you transfer money to Africa with Bitcoin it is just a fraction of the amount you pay for companies that serve Africa at the moment.\u201d\nMinckwitz added that the use of bitcoin as a store of value in Africa should also not be forgotten. \u201cMost countries in Africa have really unstable currencies, so sometimes they lose almost everything overnight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see Bitcoin as the first solution where they are in charge themselves.\u201d\nScaling Bitcoin via Off-Chain Solutions\nFrom Minckwitz\u2019s perspective, the best path forward for scaling Bitcoin is through the use of off-chain solutions. In addition to having users improve the organization of their payment flows and the bank-esque settlement techniques mentioned previously, Minckwitz would like to see this process improved further through the adoption of Segregated Witness and the lightning network.\n\u201cIt enables people [to] do transactions off chain during a certain time period,\u201d Minckwitz said of the lightning network. \u201cIn the end of this period, there is one transaction on chain to rebalance the accounts. That is an infinite scalable solution and proven since it is in a similar way commonly used today in the banking system already, so I think that is the way to go.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 24}

If you want evidence, take a look at\u00a0Laura Shin\u2019s recent article in Forbes. That\u2019s the one where she compared your in-fighting to that of the Democrats and the Republicans.\nAside from terrorist groups like ISIS, it\u2019s hard to imagine any two groups that are more universally vilified than those two right now, at least in the United States.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m a huge fan of Shin. Like all of us who are devoting their lives to this \u201cspace,\u201d she WANTS Bitcoin and the Age of Decentralization to succeed. At the same time, she has a responsibility to tell the truth as a journalist. \u00a0\nHer metaphor is accurate when you consider just what these two largest American political parties known for these days: not getting anything meaningful done, constantly attacking and bickering with each other, defending entrenched ideologies and putting selfish interests above the needs of the greater good. \u00a0\nAnd like Republicans and Democrats who are losing the respect of the country, you developers, miners and other representative stakeholders on both sides of the block size debate, who, like it or not, represent our community, are making us all look bad. The results of this loss of respect can have implications far beyond the philosophical and technical issues.\nThe world is watching and deciding what to make of this Bitcoin-Blockchain-Decentralization experiment.\nWe are one side of\u00a0Geoffrey Moore\u2019s\u00a0adoption curve chasm, known for mapping out how technologies move from early adopters to mainstream usage. The key lesson of Moore\u2019s curve is that the people who are just on the edge of the Early Majority (as opposed to the Innovators like you and the Early Adopters like me) are the ones who are deciding if they will embrace it.\nHowever, if these potential adopters read, \u201cOh, it\u2019s like Democrats and Republicans\u201d when they are considering Bitcoin, they will probably react the way that they do with the real Democrats and Republicans.\n\u201cForget all of them.\u201d\nPerception Is Key\nThis new perception, combined with previous negative press that has accumulated since the days of Mt. Gox and Silk Road and the natural enemies of decentralization, will give additional ammunition to the people who want to keep Satoshi\u2019s fantastic innovation from spreading. And they will use it to instill fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) in the general public.\nPrimavera de Filippi, a research fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University,\u00a0introduced\u00a0me to Schopenhauer\u2019s three stages of technology adoption:\nFirst, innovation is ridiculed.Second, it is violently opposed.Third, it is recognized as inevitable.\nFor many others and for me, Bitcoin reaching stage 3 is indeed inevitable. We just don\u2019t know when. What we do know is that stage 2, violent opposition, can be lengthened or shortened.\nMy fear is that the longer the block size debate continues, the more FUD is created, and the longer that stage 2 lasts.\nThe ongoing drama of the block size debate is not just bad for Bitcoin, it\u2019s bad for everyone who cares about decentralization. It\u2019s bad for the startups who are actively thinking about how to market their projects to more mainstream audiences. (We even have a network just for them.)\nWorse, it\u2019s bad for the people who don\u2019t even know they should care about decentralization and are being harmed daily, like the 2 billion unbanked and immigrants paying exorbitant fees for international remittances.\nBitcoin is the poster child for the decentralization movement, which is why I care so much about putting this block size/scaling debate behind us.\nThe Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning, NY Times columnist Tom Friedman has a new book out called\u00a0Thank You for Being Late.\u00a0In it, he talks about a number of macro-trends all contributing to the \u201cAge of Accelerations.\u201d\nInterestingly, he says, \u201cI am sure I will be writing about blockchain in the paperback edition of this book\u201d (p.146). And on page 275: \u201cIf we want to liberate\u00a0society, we first need to liberate the Internet.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nA thought leader like Friedman, who can push a significant segment of the early majority to action with a single column, doesn\u2019t fully understand the technology yet (I\u2019ve already pinged him and begun that process) but is thus far optimistic. Conversely, we need to recognize that the LAST thing we want for him and others like him to say is, \u201cIt has potential, but it\u2019s not ready for prime-time because they can\u2019t get along and that just puts you at risk.\u201d\nAt the end of the book, Friedman talks about how government is broken and about his upbringing in Minnesota. For many years, according to Friedman, Minnesota had a tremendous legacy of bipartisanship that was a model and inspiration for the nation. Democrats and Republicans worked together. They compromised. They got stuff done.\nOn a larger scale, government used to be about compromise. In the U.S. at least, we need a grand compromise on things like taxes, spending, immigration reform and healthcare, but no one is willing to budge from their rigid positions. Politicians today just dig their heels in. It\u2019s frustrating, angering, and it makes us vulnerable in so many ways.\nSo, if everyone from the outside looks at the \u201ccivil war\u201d between Core and Unlimited and reads in a major publication like Forbes, \u201cWell, it\u2019s like Democrats and Republicans,\u201d it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone saying, \u201cYes, I would love to have MORE of that in my life.\u201d\nI understand the basic technical mechanics of the block size debate. I understand there are philosophical issues (and real money) at stake, and I understand enough to recognize that we have a great thing going here. To make it even greater, we need a whole bunch more people to realize that it is, in fact, better than our current systems of centralization because it has less risk, less friction, greater security and lower costs \u2014 all of which is better for everyone.\nWhat I don\u2019t have is the answer to what the compromise is.\nBut, as a marketer with over 20 years\u2019 experience in disruptive technology, I recognize that the people on the other side of the adoption chasm are not like us. They are much more risk-averse. They\u2019ve been burned by promises of technology panaceas and they aren\u2019t going to read Satoshi\u2019s white paper, try to figure out what SegWit or lightning networks are, or understand what hashrates are all about.\nThey are just going to ask themselves, \u201cIs the risk worth it?\u201d\nWe have a chance to do what the Republicans and Democrats are seemingly unable to do: make a compromise for the sake of the endeavor.\nI can\u2019t tell you what it should be.\u00a0All I would just suggest is that the parties agree to come together with open minds and possibly a world-class mediator. It\u2019s time to be like the leaders of old who were able, when necessary, to put personal feelings and self-interest aside for the benefit of the cause.\nThe longer the scaling debate drags on, the longer the larger cause of decentralization will suffer a setback.\nAs I look around at the state of the world and the challenges that Friedman accurately identifies facing all of humanity, we can\u2019t afford any unnecessary delays.\nI just hope we can resolve it soon.\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Jeremy Epstein.

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pulled an about-face this week and resurrected the rejected Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF COIN. Although the outcome is still binary and will likely be rejected a second time, there is renewed hope the COIN ETF or something similar will eventually pass SEC regulatory scrutiny. This would allow for the opportunity of a massive influx of untapped investors who do not otherwise have access to or confidence in the Bitcoin market. \nThe digital currency space market capitalization as a whole just surpassed $30 billion for the first time. This is certainly an indication of a growing and mature ecosystem and makes for a splashy headline, but overall, I put little stock into market capitalization for many alt coins which have various supply variables including no total cap on number of coins, pre-mines, insta-mines, or a majority of supply held by the development team. \n\nUSD withdrawals continue to be halted on Bitfinex, one of the leading USD exchanges. This essentially means selling BTC for USD on that exchange can only buy more Bitcoin or another digital currency. It\u2019s a bit of a one-way street at the moment so it\u2019s no surprise that there continues to be a $100 premium on Bitfinex. We can fully expect this to continue until USD withdrawals resume, or the buyers get exhausted, and we probably won\u2019t see full resolution until the former happens. Despite some circulating rumors, I don\u2019t see any evidence to suggest that Bitfinex is insolvent; they are handling digital currency withdrawals without issue. Some users have been avoiding Bitfinex entirely. The Bitfinex cold wallet balance has been on a downtrend since the halt of USD withdrawals. \nBitcoin Unlimited blocks broke an all-time high and resumed their collision course for parity with Bitcoin Core blocks. Bitcoin Unlimited miners may opt to fork with as little as 51 percent of hash power support, though it would probably be closer to 70 percent. I fully expect a hard fork attempt to occur but remain unsuccessful.\n\nNode support for Unlimited and Core largely remain unchanged from the previous week.\n\nAll eyes are currently on the inverted head and shoulders, a bullish reversal pattern, which has a neckline at an all-time high. Although traditionally occurring at the bottom of a downtrend with a volume profile, the pattern is convincing.\n\nExpect resolution of the pattern to occur with volume confirmation. The $1700 measured target may seem absurd, especially for some of us who have been watching this space grow over the past four or more years, but based on technicals, it\u2019s the target nonetheless. \nMany exchanges have again surpassed gold parity or are sitting just below parity, but the index is again flirting with the gold price, which historically has acted as heavy resistance.\n\nA convincing break of this arbitrary resistance would be additional bullish confluence coupled with the inverted head and shoulders breakout.\nSummary\nThe SEC is reviewing the rejection of the COIN ETF. Total digital currency market capitalization broker $30 billion for the first time. USD withdrawal on Bitfinex continues to be halted.Bitcoin Unlimited inches closer and closer to hard fork possibilities.A bullish chart pattern continues to project ~$1700 target.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nMajor Bitcoin mining hardware producer Bitmain can remotely shut down almost all active Antminer machines. Dubbed the \u201cAntbleed\u201d backdoor, abuse of the vulnerability could probably knock half of all hash power on the Bitcoin network offline.\n\u201cEven if Bitmain had no bad intent, this is a gaping security hole,\u201d said our source, who discovered the backdoor but asked to remain anonymous.\nThe backdoor code can be seen on Pastebin and on GitHub, and today a\u00a0website has been put up for Antbleed as well.\nHow It Works\nThe Antbleed backdoor is \u201cstupid simple,\u201d as our source described it.\nWhenever an Antminer appears online, and once every one to eleven minutes, it contacts a \u201cport 7000 service\u201d on the domain auth.minerlink.com, which is owned by Bitmain. The domain currently does not connect to any IP-address, and therefore does nothing.\nHowever, the domain could in the (near) future start connecting to a corresponding IP-address. If that happens, it will report the Antminer\u2019s serial number as well as the MAC address and the IP-address to Bitmain.\u00a0\nThis could be enough for the company to link the machine to a specific user.\n\u201cBitmain can use this data to cross check against customer sales and delivery records making it personally identifiable,\u201d our source explained. \u201cAnd Bitcoin mining is a small industry, so it shouldn\u2019t even be hard to connect the machines to specific pools, or blocks.\u201d\nOnce connected, the server the Antminer connects to \u2014 Bitmain\u2019s server \u2014 sends a message back. If that message is \u201ctrue\u201d, the machine will continue mining. But if that message is \u201cfalse\u201d, the code produces a piece of text that reads: \u201cStop mining!!!\u201d\nIt seems obvious that this piece of text would make the machine stop mining, which is indeed confirmed by our source, who tested it on an Antminer machine. Additionally, it can be checked by anyone with an affected miner; antbleed.com explains how.\nThe backdoor\u00a0can be verified, since it is embedded in open source code. In fact, it seems rather strange Bitmain would include such a backdoor \u201cout in the open\u201d, for anyone to see.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd, who was quick to comment to the issue on Twitter and Reddit, suggested:\n\u201cBitmain probably underestimated how much source code actually does get audited \u2014 it's a common myth that code never gets read. Also, if you're going to add a backdoor, you do want plausible deniability in case it does get found. Hiding in plain sight, amongst thousands of lines of undocumented code, helps. Perhaps Bitmain will claim this is actually a feature.\u201d\nWhat It Affects\nThe backdoor probably affects most Antminers in use today: the S9, the T9 the R4, as well as Litecoin\u2019s L3.\nThe commit date indicates the backdoor was introduced in July 2016. This is one month after the first S9 machines were shipped. All machines that shipped since July 2016 should have the backdoor on board, which means they can be shut down by Bitmain. Machines that were shipped before July 2016, but have been updated since, should be vulnerable, too.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say with certainty how much hash power on the Bitcoin network is subject to the vulnerability,\u201d our source said. \u201cBut since Bitmain is by far the market leader for hardware machines, it\u2019s not a stretch to attribute at least half of all hash power to the vulnerable machines. As such, Bitmain could potentially shut down an enormous share of Bitcoin\u2019s hash power with the push of a button. In addition to that, the company can target specific machines or customers.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s not just Bitmain who could shut down the machines. Because the connection is unauthenticated, the code will connect to anything that appears like \"auth.minerlink.com\", which can be spoofed by certain third parties. Apart from Bitmain, it could, for example, be an internet service provider, anti-DoS service CloudFlare (used by Bitmain), or anyone who can hijack DNS records: rogue ICANN employees, hackers, the U.S. government, and more.\n\u201cThe nicest possible explanation is that Bitmain is incompetent at security, putting the whole Bitcoin network at risk,\u201d Todd concluded. \u201cBut given the history we have of miners threatening with attacks, it wouldn't surprise me if this was added as a last resort option for shutting down competitors if they needed to push something through with hashing power.\u201d\n\nUpdate\u00a0\nA representative for Bitmain commented on the issue:\n\"The code running on the machines is open source, everyone can review it so no secret features exist in it. The code that was pointed out is a feature to allow owners of the Antminers to be able to remotely control their miners. It is not a secret and it does not provide any kind of remote control to Bitmain for the Antminers it does not own or operate in its own mining farms.\"\n(Note: The representative provided this comment a bit before publication of the article, but due to a miscommunication this update was added only briefly after publication.)\nUpdate\u00a0\nIt should be noted that if you own an affected machine, a fix is available on antbleed.com as well.\nUpdate\nBitmain has issued an official press release commenting on the issue. In it, the company acknowledges the existence of the feature, stating:\n\"This feature was intended to allow the owners of Antminer to remotely shut down their miners that may have been stolen or hijacked by their hosting service provider, and to also provide law enforcement agencies with more tracking information in such cases. We never intended to use this feature on any Antminer without authorization from its owner.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story will be updated as more news becomes available.\nThe identity of our source is known to us and considered to be reliable.\n\n\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 26}

Malta can be a global trailblazer in this regard,\u201d Muscat stated. \u00a0\n\u201cI understand that regulators are wary of this technology but the fact is that it\u2019s coming,\u201d he added. \u201cWe must be on the frontline in embracing this crucial innovation, and we cannot just wait for others to take action and copy them.

It also provides companies with a central location in Europe and full access to the European Single Market. If Malta actively encourages innovative startups to relocate to the island with tax incentives, a friendly regulator and a supportive government, it would not be surprising to see fintech startups move part or all of their operations to this Mediterranean island.

Without a supply halving, like Bitcoin, there may be a continuous cycle of new highs, influx of hash rate and subsequent selloff.\n\nMiners may or may not immediately sell for a profit or loss, but at the very least they\u2019ll need to cover their costs for overhead, such as electricity, rent, hardware and employees. This hurts smaller mining operations to a greater degree because they are able to mine at a loss for a shorter duration than larger operations, thus consolidating mining power even further.\nWithout a deflationary supply of ETH, there may not be enough to drive the market higher and higher on fundamental developments alone. It is likely too early to tell on the importance or significance of this divergence, but worth watching as ETH gains notoriety.\nGrayscale Investments, the company headed by Barry Silbert, who is responsible for the\u00a0Bitcoin Investment Trust, recently\u00a0released a report\u00a0comparing the economic models of Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Ethereum, identifying this very problem, although it is important to acknowledge that Grayscale is likely to release of an\u00a0ETC Investment Trust\u00a0in the near future.\nThe ETH price has found a horizontal support zone, indicated by previous long candle wicks in the same zone. Should this level fail to support the price, I\u2019d expect a target of the previous bull flag.\n\nThere is also an active bearish reversal chart pattern, the head and shoulders, which has now completed. The pattern can be identified through three successive local tops with a descending volume profile. Currently, it is highly suggestive of bearish continuation. The measured move would take the price to ~$14.25 (or 0.01188 BTC), a complete retrace and likely an overestimation of the move.\n\nWhen a pattern forms and does not continue as expected \u2014 that is, if this bearish head and shoulders does not break down \u2014 expect a retest of local highs.\nA candle close to the 50% retracement \u2014 or a break of this level \u2014 would be another indicator of growing bearish momentum.\nETH price has also failed to hold support above the 200 EMA for the first time since the beginning of the trend. A 50/200 EMA cross would indicate further bearish momentum as well.\n\nLastly, on lower timeframes, there is another bearish head-and-shoulders fractal, with a less convincing descending volume profile. A head-and-shoulders pattern on the bottom of a trend is very rare and often suggests strong bearish continuation. The fractal is contained within a falling wedge as well, normally a bullish reversal pattern. Conflicting chart patterns on a lower timeframe are usually superseded by a higher timeframe pattern.\n\nOverall, it is more likely that the head and shoulders on the four-hour timeframe will continue to complete after a throwback to resistance/support driven by the falling wedge.\nSummary\nMining hash rate continues to pour into ETH despite an economic model without a deflationary supply.A high timeframe bearish head and shoulders and break of the 200 EMA suggest further bearish momentum is likely.The next likely support is between ~$25\u201329.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 10}

Among the Bitcoin companies located there, Luno (formerly BitX) and Bitcoin Indonesia have watched this growth with interest.\nHeadquartered in Singapore, Luno allows customers to buy, sell and store the digital currency. It operates in several countries around the world including the U.K., South Africa and Nigeria. In Southeast Asia, Luno has operations in Malaysia, one of its largest markets, as well as in Indonesia, where activity has been growing consistently.\n\u201cFrom our perspective, Bitcoin is slowly gaining mainstream adoption in Southeast Asia. We see this every day in the numbers we track in terms of signups, transaction volumes, etc,\u201d Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia Pacific at Luno, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe volatility of the price makes it particularly attractive for traders. People who have bought Bitcoin as a store of value have been quite happy with the performance of the asset [as] it has been one of the best performing assets globally over the past year.\u201d\nBut new trends are beginning to emerge as well, he said, noting the growing use of Bitcoin as a payment mechanism. \u201cCross-border e-commerce is one of the most popular use cases here since credit card penetration is quite low in the emerging markets and using bitcoin avoids the whole issue of charge-backs for a merchant,\u201d Ayyar said.\nHe also mentioned that institutional interest has been on the rise, with high-net-worth individuals and private funds now looking to allocate a percentage of their funds to the asset class. He expects to see this trend grow over the coming months and years.\nBali-based Bitcoin Indonesia has also witnessed the public\u2019s growing appetite for the digital currency. The exchange platform has seen its daily transaction volume reach up to $1.48 million (Rp 20 billion). Today, it serves over 200,000 users, up from 80,000 at the end of 2015.\nAccording Suasti Atmastuti Astaman, business development manager at Bitcoin Indonesia, the positive trend is due to the fact that Bitcoin has successfully gained global trust. \u201cAt present, as more and more countries have relaxed their stances on digital currency, including the United States, China and Russia, more and more people are putting their trust in it,\u201d he\u00a0told\u00a0the Jakarta Post in a recent interview.\nUnclear Regulations\nWhile some jurisdictions have moved forward and established clear rulings on digital currencies, regulators in Southeast Asia have remained quiet on the subject.\nAccording to Dante Fuentes, chief compliance officer at Security Bank Corporation in the Philippines, policymakers tend to move prudently because, from their perspective, digital currency is still very new.\n\u201cAt Security Bank, for any virtual currency related companies, we ensure that the account is not used for virtual currency trading activities,\u201d Fuentes\u00a0told\u00a0IQPC Singapore. \u201cIncreasingly, we want to know that companies dealing in virtual currency are performing some kind of KYC to avoid tainted funds, but this has yet to be firmly put in place.\u201d\nBut for Ayyar, unclear regulation is what\u2019s been hampering Bitcoin adoption in the region, often discouraging banks from conducting business with Bitcoin companies. In November last year, Maybank\u00a0closed\u00a0two of Coinbox\u2019s corporate accounts without warning or notice. Kuala Lumpur\u2013based Coinbox operates a bitcoin trading platform.\n\u201cThe issue is that traditional criminal activity that takes place with fiat currency can also be performed with virtual currency. Since the banks are unable to monitor these transactions, it is a new platform for criminals to continue the same money-laundering activities and scams that they were performing before,\u201d Fuentes said.\nLuno, which is aiming to become the largest bitcoin wallet and exchange across Southeast Asia, hopes to see regulators in the region communicate more about their position on digital currencies in the near future. In the meantime, the company is working with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to test its technology for cross-border money transfers.\nAyyar wasn\u2019t able to provide specific details on the matter but said that the tests are going well and that the company has made good progress both in terms of cost and speed.\nLuno\u00a0was selected\u00a0to join the FCA\u2019s regulatory sandbox in November 2016 alongside several other Bitcoin and blockchain startups, including SETL, Epiphyte and Nivaura.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 10}

These data centers tend to be located in places with inexpensive electricity, often where hydroelectricity is plentiful, like Washington State in the U.S. But how much electricity is consumed by these miners? Knowing this helps us to better understand the economics and financial opportunities of Bitcoin mining. Previous estimates have not been very accurate, often making simplistic assumptions. So I decided to conduct the most exhaustive research on this topic that I could. All sources used in this research are listed in my original blog post.\nI started by drawing a chart juxtaposing the Bitcoin hash rate with the market availability of mining ASICs and their energy efficiency. This allows calculating with certainty the lower and upper bounds for the global electricity consumption of miners (which is not wasteful in my opinion.)\n\nI split the timeline in 10 phases representing the releases and discontinuances of mining ASICs. \nI reached out to some Bitcoin ASIC manufacturers when doing this market research. Canaan was very open and transparent (thank you!) and gave me one additional extremely useful data point: They manufactured a total of 191 PH/s of A3218 ASICs.\nDetermining the upper bound for the electricity consumption is then easily done by making two worst-case assumptions. Firstly we assume that 100% of the mining power added during each phase came from the least efficient hardware available at that time that is still mining profitably. Secondly we assume none of this mining power, some of it being barely profitable, was ever upgraded to more efficient hardware.\nHardware that is no longer profitable has obviously been retired. As of February 26, 2017 (difficulty = 441e9, 1 BTC = 1180 USD, and assuming $0.05/kWh \u2014 half the worldwide average electricity cost) an ASIC is profitable if its efficiency is better than 0.56 J/GH:\n1e9*3600 (hashes per hour of 1 GH/s) / (2^32 * 441e9 (difficulty)) * 12.5 (BTC reward per block) * 1180 (USD per BTC) / 0.05 ($/kWh) * 1000 (Wh/kWh) = 0.56 J/GH\nSo 3 ASICs in the chart are no longer profitable: Neptune, RockerBox, and A3222.\nAlso, most of the hardware deployed during phase 0\u2014CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, first-generation ASICs\u2014has not been profitable for a long time, so we make the assumption these miners who deployed during this phase have since then upgraded to the least efficient ASIC available at the end of phase 0 that is still profitable: BM1384.\nFurthermore, despite A3218 being the least efficient in phases 5-8 we can only assume 191 PH/s of it were deployed, and the rest of the hash rate came from the second least efficient ASIC: BM1385 (phase 6), Bitfury 28nm (phase 7), or BF8162C16 (phase 8).\nTo summarize all this, the upper bound estimate leads to the following breakdown of hardware deployments:\nPhase 0: 290 PH/s @ 0.51 J/GH (BM1384)3Phases 1-3: 150 PH/s @ 0.51 J/GH (BM1384)Phase 4: 40 PH/s @ 0.25 J/GH (BM1385)Phase 5: 191 PH/s @ 0.29 J/GH (A3218) + 159 PH/s @ 0.25 J/GH (BM1385)Phase 6: 670 PH/s @ 0.25 J/GH (BM1385)Phase 7: 350 PH/s @ 0.20 J/GH (Bitfury 28nm)Phase 8: 150 PH/s @ 0.13 J/GH (BF8162C16)Phase 9: 1250 PH/s @ 0.15 J/GH (A3212)Average weighted by PH/s: 0.238 J/GH\nTherefore the upper bound electricity consumption of the network at 3250 PH/s assuming the worst-case scenario of miners deploying the least efficient hardware of their time (0.238 J/GH in average) is 774 MW or 6.78 TWh/year.\nNow, what about a lower bound estimate? We start with a few observations about the latest 4 most efficient ASICs:\nBitfury BF8162C16\u2019s efficiency can be as low as 0.06 J/GH. But the clock and voltage configuration can be set to favor speed over energy efficiency. All known third party BF8162C16-based miner designs favor speed at 0.13 J/GH (1, 2). Bitfury\u2019s own private data centers also favor speed with their immersion cooling technology (1, 2, 3). The company once advertised the BlockBox container achieved 0.13 J/GH (2 MW for 16 PH/s), presumably close to the efficiency achieved by their data centers. But we want to calculate a lower bound, so let\u2019s assume the average BF8162C16 deployed in the wild operates at 0.10 J/GH.KnCMiner Solar is exclusively deployed in their private data centers and achieves an efficiency of 0.07 J/GH.Bitmain BM1387\u2019s efficiency is 0.10 J/GH.Canaan A3212\u2019s efficiency is 0.15 J/GH.\nAs to market share, we know KnCMiner declared bankruptcy and was later acquired by GoGreenLight. They currently account for 0.3% of the global hash rate\u2026 a rounding error we can ignore.\nTherefore the lower bound electricity consumption of the network at 3250 PH/s assuming the best-case scenario of 100% of miners currently running one of the latest 3 most efficient ASICs (at best 0.10 J/GH) is 325 MW or 2.85 TWh/year.\nCan we do better than merely calculating lower and upper bounds? I think so, but with the exception of Canaan, other mining hardware manufacturers tend to be secretive about their market share, so anything below are just educated guesses.\nVirtually all of the 1750 PH/s added after June 2016 came from BF8162C16, BM1387, and A3212, with the latter having the smallest market share. So the average efficiency of this added hash rate is likely around 0.11-0.13 J/GH. This represents 190-230 MW.\nI would further venture that out of the 1500 PH/s existing as of June 2016, perhaps half was upgraded to BF8162C16/BM1387/A3212, while the other half remains a mixture of BM1385 and A3218. This represent 750 PH/s at 0.11-0.13 J/GH, and 750 PH/s at 0.26-0.28 J/GH, or a total of 280-310 MW.\nI believe an insignificant proportion of the hash rate (less than 5%?) comes from all other generations of ASICs. Bitfury BF864C55 and 28nm deployments were upgraded to BF8162C16. KnCMiner/GoGreenLight represents 0.3%. BM1384 is close to being unprofitable. RockerBox, A3222, Neptune have long been unprofitable.\nTherefore my best educated guess for the electricity consumption of the network at 3250 PH/s adds up to 470-540 MW or 4.12-4.73 TWh/year.\nEconomics of Mining\nGiven the apparent high energy-efficiency, hence relatively small percentage of mining income that one needs to spend on electricity to cover the operating costs of an ASIC miner, it may seem that mining is an extremely profitable risk-free venture, right?\nNot necessarily. Though mining can be quite profitable, in reality it depends mostly on (1) luck about when BTC gains in value and (2) timing of how early a given model of mining machine is put online (compared to other competing miners deploying the same machines.) I say this as founder of mining ASIC integrator TAV, as an investor who deployed over time $250k+ of GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs, and as someone who once drove 2000+ miles to transport his GPU farm to East Wenatchee, Washington State in 2011 in order to exploit the nation\u2019s cheapest electricity at $0.021/kWh\u2014 Yes, it was worth it!\nTo demonstrate the real-world profitability of a miner, I modeled the income and costs generated by an Antminer S5 batch #1 ($418, 590 W, 1155 GH/s) starting from its release date on 27 December 2014, assuming mined bitcoins are sold on a daily basis at the Coindesk BPI, and assuming $0.05/kWh. See income-antminer-s5.csv\nThe CSV file shows that on its first day an S5 mined 0.01472124 BTC = $4.64, cost $0.71 in electricity, therefore generated $3.93 of income (15% of mining income is spent on electricity.)\nThe income decreased over time. 1 year and 9 months later, on October 8 2016, electricity costs surpassed income for the first time. By that date the total income was $1021. So a miner who had invested $418 into an S5 would have turned it into $1021, a 2.4\u00d7 gain. So yes, mining was quite profitable. (However another investor who on 27 December 2014 bought $418 worth of bitcoins would be worth $818 on 8 October 2016, a 2.0\u00d7 gain. It could be argued that a large reason why mining was profitable came simply from BTC gaining value.)\nSome interesting observations:\nBy 15 January 2016 84% of the lifetime income of the S5 had been generated; at this point 39% of the daily income ($0.71 out of $1.84) was being spent on electricity.By 15 July 2016 99% of the lifetime income of the S5 had been generated; at this point 78% of the daily income ($0.71 out of $0.90) was being spent on electricity, and in total $403 has been spent on electricity which is still slightly less than the cost of the hardware at $418.\nThe S5 started with electricity costs at 15%, generated a good chunk of its income by 39%, and essentially became worthless beyond 78%.\nSummary\nWe can calculate the upper bound for the global electricity consumption of Bitcoin miners by assuming they deploy the least efficient hardware of their time and never upgrade it. As to the lower bound it can be calculated by assuming everyone has upgraded to the most efficient hardware. The table below summarizes the electricity consumption of miners, their energy efficiency, annual electrical costs (assuming $0.05/kWh), and percentage of the world\u2019s energy consumption (9 425 Mtoe, or 109 613 TWh, or 12.51 TW, according to IEA statistics for year 2014,) with all numbers calculated as of February 26, 2017:\n\nThis may sound like a lot of electricity but when we considering the big picture, I believe Bitcoin mining is not wasteful. Also an interesting comparison to make is that according to a 2008 study from the United States Energy Department\u2019s Energy Information Administration (EIA) these figures are comparable to or less than the annual electricity consumption of decorative Christmas lights in the country (6.63 TWh/year.)\nLastly, when modeling the costs and revenues of a miner over its entire life such as the Antminer S5, we find out that the hardware cost is as high as, if not higher than, its lifetime electricity cost. Therefore a miner\u2019s business plan should not look at the electricity costs alone, and cannot trivialize hardware costs when calculating expected profitability.\nThis is a guest post by Marc Bevand.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nOne of the more futuristic ideas for Bitcoin that has been floated around is that it could become the currency for payments between machines on\u00a0some new kind of world computer.\u00a0BitWrk\u00a0is a project that has turned this concept into a reality \u2014 albeit via a bare-bones version without many bells and whistles.\nThe basic idea with BitWrk in its current form is to allow 3D graphic artists to outsource the rendering of their images, which can be a computationally expensive process, to other internet-connected devices. BitWrk establishes a market for these devices to communicate with each other, and users of the 3D-design software\u00a0Blender\u00a0can opt to pay to have their work rendered by devices connected to the BitWrk network rather than their local machines.\nWhile BitWrk is used only for 3D rendering right now, it could be extended to provide a distributed computing layer for many other applications in the future.\nBitcoin Magazine\u00a0recently reached out to BitWrk developer Jonas Eschenburg to learn more about his vision for the project.\nA Simpler Approach to the World Computer\nInstead of trying to build BitWrk directly on top of a blockchain and aiming for a completely decentralized system, Eschenburg created a market for users to buy and sell computing power with bitcoin via a central service running on Google App Engine. After the participants are matched on the central service, they then connect to each other in a P2P fashion.\n\u201cBitWrk uses bitcoin as currency but otherwise doesn\u2019t try [to] be completely decentralized or blockchain-based,\u201d said Eschenburg. \u201cThis makes a lot of things easier and buys time to think about issues such as how to prevent cheating or how to distribute data efficiently.\u201d\nThe idea of a world computer enabled by bitcoin transactions is something that has been discussed by many advocates of the digital currency,\u00a0including 21 CEO Balaji Srinivasan. The basic idea is that devices with cheap hardware could autonomously purchase system resources, such as storage or computer processing power, with bitcoin via some online market.\n21 already has a marketplace\u00a0for bitcoin-payable APIs, such as pinging a website or issuing some real-world data, and Ethereum is a more generalized version of this concept as a blockchain for the execution of Turing-complete smart contracts.\nEschenburg explained why he didn\u2019t build BitWrk on top of the platform. \u201cEthereum was made for trustworthy, not high-performance, computation. It doesn\u2019t provide the bandwidth to manage each and every BitWrk transaction. In order to use Ethereum, you have to use it sparsely.\u00a0The Golem Project\u00a0does it that way, and I wish them much success. It is an interesting project and it also tries to achieve distributed Blender rendering, which is a good thing.\u201d\nBitcoin has inspired a countless number of projects focused on the decentralization of everything from Uber to venture capital financing over the past few years, but\u00a0it\u2019s unclear how many of these projects use decentralization as a tool that actually adds value to their offering.\nIn the case of Bitcoin, there was a clear issue being solved by enabling a decentralized, digital, censorship-resistant store of value and medium of exchange.\nBitWrk\u2019s Proof of Concept\nBitWrk is currently in a proof-of-concept stage where it can be used only for rendering 3D graphics. During this stage of development, Eschenburg plans to work out the kinks, figure out exactly how the system should function, and build a user base.\n\u201cThese days, BitWrk emphasizes the rendering use case a lot,\u201d said Eschenburg. \u201cThat is because, in order to build up a user base, the product has to be well-suited for the specific job. It doesn\u2019t help to have a highly generic product that can do everything but makes everything cumbersome. At least for now, BitWrk needs to become a tool for artists.\u201d\nIn terms of developing specific functions of the network, the prevention of cheating by those who say they will render images for BitWrk users is a concern for Eschenburg. \u201cThis is the most difficult question to answer, and the project will hinge on having a good solution,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI have thought a lot about this issue and I believe the answer lies in making cheating economically unattractive,\u201d Eschenburg continued. \u201cEvery buyer will have the option to rate the seller after each finished transaction, similar to what people do after they buy on eBay. BitWrk will reward positive ratings with lower fees.\u201d\nThe current version of BitWrk also uses a centralized model when it comes to payments. \u201cAs BitWrk needs microtransactions much smaller than what has ever been feasible with Bitcoin, I chose the centralized way, in which participants deposit some bitcoin on their accounts and withdraw later,\u201d Eschenburg explained. \u201cThe whole microtransaction business is taken care of within the system.\n\u201cBitcoin transaction fees on the other hand do play a role when depositing or withdrawing money, so transactions shouldn\u2019t get too small, either,\u201d Eschenburg added.\nEschenburg is hopeful that his project can establish bitcoin as a currency within the 3D artist community.\nBitWrk\u2019s Grander Vision\nOf course, the eventual goal for Eschenburg is to move beyond 3D graphics rendering. \u201cThere is a whole bunch of problems called \u2018embarrassingly parallel,\u2019 which are suited toward distributed computation,\u201d he said. \u201cScientific applications play a big role, [as does] brute-force cryptoanalysis. A very well-known problem of this class is Bitcoin itself, namely its mining process.\u201d\nAccording to Eschenburg, the mechanism behind BitWrk can remain the same whether it\u2019s used for rendering 3D animations or cracking crypto keys.\nIn addition to expanding BitWrk to other use cases, Eschenburg would also like to implement payment channels or the\u00a0lightning network\u00a0at some point in the future. \u201cI see payment channels, and especially the lightning network, as a promising path that could enable smaller (and, even more importantly, quicker) deposits and withdrawals,\u201d he said. \u201cCurrently, this is not a top priority, though.\n\u201cBitWrk wants to be a very cost-effective way of accessing a lot of computer power, so the amounts of money needed aren\u2019t that big,\u201d Eschenburg added.\nBitWrk is an open-source project and\u00a0can be found on GitHub. According to Eschenburg, version 0.6.0 is currently in the works, which will enable better usability and new features such as LAN rendering with Blender.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 10}

At the time, Dunworth claimed Snapcard was the most popular wallet in Brazil, and the company had recently partnered with mobile payments startup PagPop to enable bitcoin payments for 12,000 merchants in the country.\nNow, Snapcard has moved away from consumer payments and rebranded as Wyre with a focus on international money transfers.\n\u201cWe had to look at the writing on the wall,\u201d said Dunworth during the recent podcast. \u201cWe had a lot of competitors at the start \u2014 we were competing directly with BitPay \u2014 and they were very good at what they did. But we just didn\u2019t feel as confident in that market.\u201d\nDunworth added that Snapcard was \u201cdoing very well\u201d according to various adoption metrics; however, in regard to the adoption of bitcoin for consumer payments, Dunworth stated, \u201cWe kind of bet on that, and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\nDunworth went on to explain that the acceptance of bitcoin payments by merchants has more of a \u201cnovelty effect\u201d than anything else, at least when it comes to buying pizza in California. In the past, Dunworth has noted that bitcoin makes more sense for consumer payments in the developing world.\nA Pivot to International Money Transfers\nDunworth claimed, after the pivot to Wyre, that the company is now the \u201clargest money transfer platform built on blockchain technology hands down.\u201d\nAccording to a company press release from December 2016, there was $35 million worth of international money transfers being processed per month at the time, and Wyre accounted for 90 percent of that volume.\n\u201cWe know better than anyone what this value proposition is for in terms of remittances, which obviously is touted as a pretty common use case,\u201d Dunworth said. \u201cFor us, we definitely are seeing a huge amount of value add.\u201d\nBitcoin Vs. Private Blockchains\nWhile there was a lot of hype regarding private, permissioned ledger systems in 2015 and 2016, Dunworth has been consistent with his preference for public, permissionless systems such as Bitcoin. \u201cI don\u2019t believe private blockchains are going to be successful,\u201d he told Draper during the recent interview.\nDunworth also compared private ledger technology to the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and other popular publications pooling their resources and charging a subscription fee for access to their network of instant information rather than having everyone simply connect to the open internet. In Dunworth\u2019s view, the prospect of the New York Times competing with a kid blogging in a small town in Norway is a much more exciting scenario.\n\u201cWe build our [platform] on open ledgers \u2014 like proper, public blockchains,\u201d Dunworth said. \u201cWe don\u2019t do private blockchains because I want to make the blockchain easy to take advantage of, and right now, us as Wyre, we\u2019re doing that for companies, but eventually, we\u2019ll be able to open up to anyone.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 11}

The award ceremony will take place in Stockholm, Sweden on May 15, 2017.\nOver the years de Soto\u2019s work has had a major impact on land and other asset rights worldwide and was the primary inspiration behind the\u00a0World Bank\u2019s Doing Business program. Through his efforts, de Soto has argued that the main problem in many developing nations is not capital per se but a lack of property rights. This point was the central piece in his popular book\u00a0The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else (2000).\nDe Soto says he was flattered by the award. \u201cI was happy to find out that I was awarded although I\u2019ve never met nor have any familiarity with the people involved. I been told that the award process goes through seven boards. The person who called to tell me said, \u2018Did you know that you\u2019ve been a candidate seven times?\u2019 My first thought was, someone submitted my name six times and I was defeated on each of those occasions. Nevertheless I\u2019m flattered because I\u2019ve learned how important recognition becomes the older you get.\u201d\nIn a statement, the Ambassador of Sweden to Peru, Anna Ferry, congratulated de Soto on the good news at his home. \u201cIt is an honor for me to congratulate Mr. Hernando de Soto on winning the prize. His contributions have had a large impact on policy formulation for improving people\u2019s living conditions and livelihoods. I am certain that the current work of Mr. Hernando de Soto and the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD) will continue to make a difference. I am also very happy that the prize goes to a Peruvian national this year.\u201d\nNew Property Rights Through the Blockchain\nDe Soto has long asserted that citizens of poor countries are unable to develop plots of land or utilize them as collateral because they lack clear legal titles. He says that when ownership of assets is difficult to trace and validate amid no legally recognizable set of rules governing them, they become what he calls\u00a0\u201cdead capital,\u201d\u00a0with no real inherent value.\nAs such, de Soto has advocated for blockchain technology as a potential solution for solving these problems. Of note here is his involvement with\u00a0BitFury on a blockchain technology project\u00a0to build a new land registry in the Republic of Georgia.\nIn an interview with\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine, de Soto noted that significant progress has been made in titling about half of his native country of Peru, mainly in the urban sector. He says that the issue of property and contracts has now come up in the hinterlands of Peru as well, due to that area\u2019s recent economic emergence.\n\u201cAs conflicts arise, because some people get richer than others, problems and conflicts that are related to the non-identification of who is entitled to what continue to surface. All sorts of documentation issues exist in terms of how to title and award a property, which we continue to look at.\u201d\nDe Soto notes that the presence of Facebook may serve as an additional tool in these ongoing titling efforts. \u201cWe were somewhat surprised to discover that of 30 million Peruvians, 16 million have Facebook accounts. We were able to reach about 14 million in a recent campaign of ours.\u201d\nIn terms of advancing the intersection between the blockchain and land titling, de Soto explained, \u201cWhat we are essentially talking about here is re-writing something that is already formatted and standardized on paper. So the question becomes \u2018what happens to the five billion or so global citizens who are not tied to traditional property reporting system?\u2019\u201d\nHe added that these five billion people are mainly but not exclusively in developing countries as well as in the former Soviet nations. Those people, he says, hold ledgers that are related not only to land; rather, they are related to all the assets they have.\n\u201cWhen assets were officially recorded back quite a ways in time, they weren\u2019t separated out. This is thus the situations in terms of the ledgers of five billion people in the world.\u201d\nIt\u2019s here where de Soto believes that advanced reporting systems allow for distinctions separating the land, the livestock, the buildings that are on the land, and the water rights to the stream that\u2019s next door. This is where he touts the qualities inherent in the blockchain technology with its hashes and ways of being precise, cheaper, and more secure while preserving privacy and engendering trust.\nHe calls the current period the \u201cPre-Blockchain,\u201d in regard to asset titling. What still needs to be worked out is how digital ledgers that exist today can be brought up to speed with the challenges he has seen and experienced for over thirty years in walking the world and working for different countries.\n\n\u201cEverywhere you go, things are on ledgers and they obey certain basic principles and they seem to have the same deficiency. And so the question then is \u2018how do you make all of those systems of ledgers and paper compatible with the blockchain?\u2019 That\u2019s what we are currently working on.\u201d\nHe says that Bitfury, whom he has collaborated with in the past, has asked him to join their board of advisors \u2014 an opportunity he says will allow him to become further familiarized with what blockchain technology is all about.\n\n\u201cBy being associated to them on the advisory board, I listen and become acquainted with their business by seeing what they do and don\u2019t do. We examine ways of bringing various ledgers together and create a comprehensive information infrastructure. And we ask questions about how to build true reputation and trust through a blockchain system.\u201d\nPhoto of Hernando de Soto by I4LD 1 and Flavia Gandolfi - Institute for Liberty and Democracy, CC BY-SA 3.0\u00a0https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=8062728", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 10}

It takes advantage of what Maxwell described as a \u201cvulnerability\u201d in Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work system by utilizing what the ASICBOOST inventors describe as \u201can ingenious new way to process work items.\u201d With ASICBOOST, specialized ASIC mining chips can be up to thirty percent more efficient.\nMaxwell writes that an ASIC mining device from a \u201cmajor manufacturer\u201d has been reverse engineered, which revealed that it contains undisclosed, covert use of ASICBOOST functionality. This could, Maxwell estimates, lead to as much as $100 million in increased revenue per year for a mining cartel controlling 50 percent of the network hashrate.\nIn addition to leading to enormous profits, the ASICBOOST technique can also have detrimental effects on the bitcoin mining ecosystem as a whole, Maxwell explained:\n\u201cThis could have a phenomenal centralizing effect by pushing mining out of profitability for all other participants, and the income from secretly using this optimization could be abused to significantly distort the Bitcoin ecosystem in order to preserve the advantage.\u201d\nBitmain\nMaxwell did not mention a specific hardware manufacturer in his email himself, but a source has confirmed to\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0that Bitmain is the entity in question. And with only a handful of ASIC producers active on the market today, there really aren\u2019t many candidates.\nBitmain may also hold the patent for ASICBOOST in China, but the details of\u00a0the seemingly related patent\u00a0are not clear at the time of publication.\u00a0According to BitGo CTO Ben Davenport, the patent is related to ASICBOOST.\nPerhaps even more importantly, the incompatibility of the covert use of ASICBOOST with Segregated Witness seems to be a giveaway. According to Maxwell, the covert method of mining with ASICBOOST is no longer possible if Segregated Witness activates on the Bitcoin network. Over the past six months, Bitmain has been\u00a0one of the few staunch opponents\u00a0of Segregated Witness in the Bitcoin ecosystem.As noted by Maxwell:\u201cAn incompatibility would go a long way to explain some of the more inexplicable behavior from some parties in the mining ecosystem so I began looking for supporting evidence.\u201d\nThe use of ASICBOOST could also explain why Bitmain\u2019s main pool, AntPool,\u00a0mined blocks\u00a0roughly 100KB smaller than other mining pools of a comparative size during the month of February.\nAn unnamed source familiar with the matter told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine\u00a0that the technique is easier to pull off when empty or nearly empty blocks are mined.\nAdditionally, Maxwell\u2019s post claims that the best methods of covertly implementing ASICBOOST are \u201csignificantly incompatible with virtually any method of extending Bitcoin\u2019s transaction capabilities,\u201d with extension blocks as a notable exception. Recently, Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu\u00a0tweeted\u00a0support for\u00a0a new scaling proposal\u00a0based on this exact concept.\u00a0Former BTCC COO Samson Mow even\u00a0said\u00a0Bitmain funded the extension blocks proposal, though Wu has\u00a0denied\u00a0that to be the case.\nSolutions\nASICBOOST has been\u00a0discussed\u00a0on the Bitcoin development mailing list before. As patents are state-enforced, some Bitcoin developers, like Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd, are concerned it could skew competition by non-market factors. Others, however, have argued that an optimization in hardware should not be punished by a protocol change, and at that point no consensus over a solution was found.\nNow, in his post to the mailing list, Maxwell proposes two solutions to counter at least the covert use of ASICBOOST. The first is, indeed, activation of Segregated Witness by flag day activation: miners can be \u201cforced\u201d to signal support for Segregated Witness through a\u00a0User Activated Soft Fork\u00a0(UASF) starting at a specific point in time. The second option is described as a WTXID commitment, which simply makes the covert method of ASICBOOST impossible even without activation of Segregated Witness.\nUpdate:\u00a0Bitmain has published a\u00a0press release\u00a0in response to this issue.\nAaron van Wirdum contributed to this article.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 10}

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nSegWit soft fork support continues to rise steadily as a viable option to the blocksize debate. New revelations regarding Jihan Wu and Bitmain\u2019s possible motive to not support SegWit have surfaced, which based on the court of public opinion, have not been favorable for Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) support. Follow the BTU and SegWit proposal signaling breakdown per block here.\n\n\nNodes however, continue to heavily favor Bitcoin Core and Segwit.\n\nBIP148, otherwise known as the User Activated Soft Fork (UASF), continues to have a meteoric rise among nodes. Of the 5783 active core nodes (according to coin.dance), 340 have signalled for UASF. Additional reading behind the motivation and reasoning for a UASF can be found here.\n\nAs an investor and trader, Segwit adoption in this manner would be a significant event, especially if miners who do not support SegWit find ways to circumvent the UASF with a hard fork of their own. Fortunately, the UASF would occur at a specific date and timev which would give the market the ability to price in the new data as part of the efficient market hypothesis, allowing traders to react accordingly. We can expect the market to see a UASF, or SegWit UASF, as a highly favorable solution to the current blocksize ceiling.\nThe price of bitcoin has quickly formed a W bottom after forming an M top. At the outset, this suggests that the price is finding a median, in this case ~$1100, before going higher or lower. \u00a0\n\nWhile there is certainly a bullish leaning bias for the longstanding trend, the current heavy volatility since establishing a new all-time high (ATH) is perhaps to be expected with continuing price discovery. Price has spent the past 15 days above the $1000 four digit psychological level. This is no small feat for an asset that has spent most of its lifetime far below that value; in fact, Bitcoin has only closed a daily candle above $1000 for 67 days lifetime, according to BLX. The immediate targets for a new ATH would be the 1.272 and 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the previous swing high and swing low, or $1400 and $1540 respectively. \nAdditionally, the price is again flirting with gold parity, which always grabs flashy media headlines but is largely meaningless. What is more important is the psychological realization that a digital asset could be worth more than a physical asset relied upon for the past few thousand years.\n\nThe bullish reversal pattern, inverted head and shoulders, continues to play out but a few questions have emerged. The left shoulder of these patterns is often diminutive, but this structure may negate the idea of an inverted head and shoulders entirely.\n\nWith a chart pattern breakout, there is normally a large spike in volume at the resistance or support line signifying definitive resolution of the pattern. That spike in volume has not yet occurred. Furthermore, once a break of the horizontal resistance occurs, there is often a throwback to that horizontal level to confirm support, which may have already happened (green arrow). There is also a growing bearish divergence on the Relative Strength index (RSI), a momentum oscillator. This divergence suggests that price is rising on less momentum and predicts a reversal over continuation. Should this divergence play out, I\u2019d expect a retest of the $1100 support. However, a higher high in price and RSI would negate the divergence. \nSummary\nMiner support continues for BU and user support is growing for the SegWit UASF.A UASF would occur at a specified date and time, allowing for the market to react accordingly in a timely manner, should any reaction occur at all. Expect a new all-time high shortly before or shortly after a UASF as it would signify a large protocol change and improvement to the current block size bottleneck. A bullish reversal chart pattern\u2019s existence and resolution remains an open question. Price continues in an expanded range with targets of $1100 and $1400.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

He has reported on technology, business, the arts and more for newsrooms around the United States.\nOn April 7, attorneys and tech luminaries gathered at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, for \u201cBlockchain and the Law,\u201d a conference dedicated to the future of distributed ledger technology in the legal realm.\nThe event, sponsored by Vanderbilt Law School\u2019s Program on Law and Innovation, along with Frost Brown Todd Attorneys, Bart Durham Injury Law, BTC Media and others, offered a chance for leaders at the fledgling cross-section between the worlds to give brief, TedTalk-esque presentations to a wider audience. The program included opportunities to engage speakers in one-on-one conversations, as well as a \u201cMusic City Legal Hackathon\u201d and blockchain bootcamp following the event.\n\u201cThe conversation today is one that we in the field of law are acting at our peril to ignore,\u201d said Larry Bridgesmith, the coordinator of Vanderbilt\u2019s Law and Innovation Program and an organizer behind the event, during his opening remarks. \u201cThe whole topic of blockchain and how commerce is driven and how professions are called to deliver their legal services is something we all need to pay attention to.\u201d\nProjecting the Future\nBy dedicating the bulk of the day to brief presentations from thought leaders, \u201cBlockchain and the Law\u201d afforded attendees the chance to hear discussions on a range of issues, opportunities and use cases that are emerging around the new technology and to consider how lawyers can make the most of it. One theme that was consistent throughout the presentations was the fact that it is a matter of when, not if, blockchain technology becomes a central part of attorneys\u2019 lives.\nCat Moon, the COO of Legal Alignment, began the series of presentations by describing what that future could look like.\nMoon described a typical, hypothetical lawyer named Jane, who consistently notices blockchain technology popping up in the normal course of her day. Rather than continue to practice as she always has, she decides to embrace this new technology, learn as much as she can about it and utilize that knowledge both for her clients and for her own business.\n\u201cHer epiphany was that blockchain or distributed ledger technology would in fact confer super powers on her,\u201d Moon said. \u201cShe firmly believes in what blockchain technology promised\u2026 She would be able to practice at a much higher level if she really dug in and figured out what this was all about.\u201d\nMoon used her allegorical figure to illustrate what the day-to-day world could look like for a lawyer who embraces blockchain technology. By 2020, Moon said, Jane would manage her own business, with client transactions taking place on a blockchain and payments occurring through a digital wallet. She would regularly rely on her expertise to advise clients in the financial services sector or elsewhere on blockchain-related legal issues.\nUltimately, however, it is not yet possible to paint a fully-detailed picture of Jane\u2019s future.\n\u201cI wish I could tell you more about how Jane spent her day but unfortunately, I can\u2019t,\u201d Moon said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it from 2017 and we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know.\u201d\nDetailing Use Cases\nIn addition to evangelical portraits of the soon-to-be-realized importance of distributed ledger technology for lawyers, the presentations delved into specific use cases to give the audience a sense of exactly how and why the blockchain can be implemented in legal services.\nBennett Collen, the CEO of Cognate, dove into the specifics of how the technology will disrupt the world of trademarks.\nCollen described the proprietor of a makeup store who had spent nine years cultivating business under a specific brand name. When the Kardashian family targeted the name for use with its own brand, she felt they were infringing on her company\u2019s brand. While she was technically the owner of the name \u2014 since a trademark begins as soon as a brand name starts being used \u2014 the original proprietor faced an expensive, uphill battle against the full might of the Kardashian\u2019s legal team in order to prove it.\nThe complications and expense surrounding traditional trademark filing are why 98 percent of trademarks are never registered, said Collen. He went on to point out that trademarks cost owners $275 and only 59 percent are accepted.\nCognate has levered the blockchain to offer a new approach to this legal issue. Utilizing a distributed ledger, it helps clients create an immutable, time-stamped and legally-defensible record of when a trademark was first used. If and when these clients decide to apply for a traditional federal trademark, this record can be leveraged to do so more easily.\n\u201cThe blockchain is the perfect mechanism for achieving these goals,\u201d said Collen. \u201cBy nature, records in a blockchain network are time-stamped, secured and scalable.\u201d\nIt was one of many use-case presentations that put the technological possibilities into a real-world context.\n\u201cThe blockchain is going to significantly alter the practice of law in the near future,\u201d Collen said. \u201cIt creates a new system that is more transparent, more fair and more affordable.\u201d\nDisclaimer: Bitcoin Magazine is a publication of BTC Media.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 11}
{"title": "The Art of Building Bridges to Cross-Border Payments", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/art-building-bridges-cross-border-payments/", "birthday": "Apr 11, 2017  3:41 PM EST", "date": "2017-04-11 20:41:00", "content": "For many, sending money to a family member or business in a different geographical locale is a common practice. These peer-to-peer transfers \u2014 known as remittances or cross-border payments \u2014 are frequently sent by wire, mail or online transfer. Unfortunately, these monetary transfers can take days to complete as well as result in fees and hidden costs that can add up quickly.\nAt present, there are only two primary methods of moving money: the traditional route of transferring from bank account to bank account or through remittance networks such as Western Union. Both of these processes are expensive, as confirmed by a 2016 World Bank report which found that the average cost of sending a remittance just out of the U.S. stood at around 6.01 percent.\nThe top remittance-receiving countries, according to another World Bank study, include Mexico, China, India and the Philippines. The first of these countries continues to capture the bulk of media attention with remittances to Mexico totalling $26.97 billion in 2016, up nearly 9 percent from 2015. This was the highest ever according to figures from the Mexican central bank dating back to 1995.\nA New Solution \nBecause of the high costs and long wait times associated with money transfers, the global remittance space has long been talked about as a target for disruption. Now, a U.S. based startup called bridge21 believes it can create a new strategic advantage in international transfers over banks and money transmitters, beginning with Mexico. \nHeadquartered in Denver, bridge21 is a web- and mobile-based service that allows money to be sent and stored in any currency. It was founded with the objective of fueling a new model of \u00a0\u201cmoney without borders.\u201d \u00a0Utilizing bitcoin as a means of settlement transaction, bridge21 facilitates transfers to FDIC insured bank accounts that are licensed and compliant in other countries. \nThe company originally started as a Bitcoin brokerage service before discovering a larger opportunity around the utilization of Bitcoin for remittance. Today, bridge21 is delivering what they believe will be a high demand service serving as the intersection between the purchase and sale of bitcoin for every transaction, without either the sender or receiver ever engaging with bitcoin. And all without the associated volatility and custodial concerns. \nFor a customer, the prospect of having a faster and safer mechanism for executing bank-to-bank transfers with significantly lower exchange rates is appealing. There is no denying that remittances are expensive, with the poorest people having fewer options and often being charged the highest fees. While other companies will claim their hold on this space, bridge21, which launched in beta in January, is poised to become the first globally to provide an end-to-end, \u201creal-time\u201d tool through the use of Bitcoin.\nFrom a business commerce perspective, while global trade has grown significantly since the 1970s, the cross-border payment model has changed very little. It\u2019s here where businesses hope to capitalize as well through bridge21\u2019s lower payment processing costs, settlement times, and risk exposure leading to lower pre-funding expenses and exchange rate risks. \nThe Use of Bitcoin as a Payment Rail\nIt is well established that Bitcoin can be sent throughout the world without the need for a third-party intermediary such as bridge21. The problem, however, is in how it is accessed by those on the receiving end once it arrives.\nHere\u2019s how it works: bridge21 provides a means for any user possessing a U.S. bank account to send money to a Mexican bank account. Money is withdrawn from the sender\u2019s account and used to purchase bitcoins, which bridge21 references as \u201cdigital cash.\u201d bridge21 then sends the bitcoins to Mexico where they are sold for pesos and then deposited into the recipient\u2019s bank account. \nThe process is fast and occurs after a simple confirmation on the Bitcoin network. And because the use of Bitcoin is not readily apparent to the customer, they view it as they would any other traditional bank-to-bank transaction. \nbridge21 is currently live from the U.S. to Mexico. This week, the team announced a new feature involving a major price reduction for U.S.-to-Mexico transfers, with the ability to send money to Mexico for 2 percent or even 5 percent less than standard pricing from the two countries. This Bridge Rate is tied to the true cost of purchasing and selling bitcoins in two countries, including the network fees.\nThese developments come amid major media attention on Mexico tied to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s anti-Mexican rhetoric and threats to construct a border wall to keep out illegal immigrants. The president has even said that he wants to confiscate a percentage of Mexicans' remittances to pay for his border wall, a move that may be gaining traction. The Mexican government has said it will continue to support the free flow of remittances into the country. \nbridge21 contends that the majority of money movement between the U.S. and Mexico isn\u2019t the $25 billion or so sent from U.S. workers sending money to their families in Mexico; rather it\u2019s roughly $500 billion sent bilaterally among businesses and very wealthy people conducting business trades largely through bank transfers. \nAccording to bridge21, taxing individual remittances will concentrate the cost on just 5 percent of the cross-border money flow, which would include the poorest people who can least afford it. This could have two effects. First, it could drive money transfers toward informal money transfer networks (i.e. the black market). Second, it could lower the already tepid standard of living of the poor. Neither of these reflect a good outcome.\nFounder and CEO Will Madden spent a good portion of his career at Western Union building and running payments and remittance products. He first learned about Bitcoin in late 2010 and began to envision the potential of this technology to transform cross-border payments. \nMadden says that bridge21 is focused on continuing to improve the ease with which individuals and businesses in the U.S. can send funds to Mexico. He notes though that the company has ambitious goals for 2017, including expansion into several additional corridors to fulfill its mission of providing access to money without borders. \n\u201cWe\u2019re not stopping with Mexico,\u201d said Madden, \u201cWe see much potential to expand to additional corridors such as the EU, U.K. and India which see heavy traffic of businesses and individuals sending funds outbound from the U.S.\u201d \u00a0", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 11}
{"title": "Breaking Down Bitcoin's \"AsicBoost Scandal\"", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/breaking-down-bitcoins-asicboost-scandal/", "birthday": "Apr 11, 2017  5:17 PM EST", "date": "2017-04-11 22:17:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThrough a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) draft sent to the Bitcoin development mailing list last week, long-time Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream co-founder and CTO Gregory Maxwell revealed that a Bitcoin mining hardware producer implemented the patented \u201cAsicBoost\u201d technology in its chips. While the specific manufacturer was not named in the email, it was easy to surmise that Maxwell was alluding to the Chinese mining giant Bitmain \u2014 a suspicion confirmed through a press release issued by the company the next day.\nRumors, clues and accusations have dominated social media, news sites, and chatrooms ever since, as a new dimension in Bitcoin\u2019s long-lasting scaling debate kicked tensions into high gear. Instead of the reasons given so far, some now believe that Bitmain and its mining pools have rejected the Segregated Witness soft fork (SegWit) because it is incompatible with the covert use of AsicBoost technology embedded in their chips.\nFor anyone not \u201cin the loop\u201d: here\u2019s an overview of what\u2019s going on\u2026\nAsicBoost\nIn short, AsicBoost is a technology invented by former CoinTerra CTO Timo Hanke and RSK Chief Scientist Sergio Dami\u00e1n Lerner. When implemented in ASIC chips (chips specialized for Bitcoin mining), AsicBoost can take advantage of a quirk in the implementation of Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work mining algorithm. This lets miners take a sort of a \u201cshortcut\u201d to finding a valid block.\nThis shortcut can give miners up to a 30 percent efficiency advantage \u2014 though some 15 to 20 percent seems more likely. Since miners compete on small margins, even small efficiency gains can result in big profits. Maxwell estimated that a large miner can bank up to $100 million extra per year; a claim backed by calculations by the pseudonymous \u201cpraxeology_guy.\u201d Though others, including the founder of now-defunct ASIC manufacturer KnCMiner Sam Cole, downplayed this figure. In the scheme of things \u2014 cost of electricity, ASIC design, and more \u2014 the added profit from AsicBoost alone could be much smaller.\u00a0\nUpdate: Former Spoondoolies-Tech CEO Guy Corem also estimates the added profits from AsicBoost would be significantly smaller; some $2 million extra per year.\nAsicBoost has been subject to some controversy before. Since the technology is patented, and patents are state-enforced, some worry that AsicBoost could skew Bitcoin\u2019s mining competition by non-market factors. This could in a worst-case scenario lead to a centralized and perhaps even regulated mining landscape, providing reason enough for some developers to consider changing the Bitcoin protocol to counter AsicBoost. Others, however, see AsicBoost as an optimization like so many mining optimizations realized over the years, and argue that innovative miners should not be punished by a protocol change.\nIn light of last week\u2019s events, it is important to note that AsicBoost not only can be utilized overtly, in which case it is obvious that a miner is using it, but it can also be employed covertly, which is much harder to detect. And, as it now turns out, covert use of AsicBoost is largely incompatible with the current soft fork implementation of Segregated Witness, the protocol upgrade as proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team.\nThe Admission\nWhile it was up in the air for a day or so, it is no longer a question whether Bitmain indeed implemented AsicBoost technology in its chips.\nIn their press release, the company readily admitted that it did, stating:\n\u201cOur ASIC chips, like those of some other manufacturers, have a circuit design that supports AsicBoost.\u201d\nAdditionally, Bitmain said that it \u201chas tested AsicBoost on [Bitcoin\u2019s] Testnet,\u201d while also explaining that the company can legally use the technology:\n\u201cBitmain holds the AsicBoost patent in China. We can legally use it in our own mining farms in China to profit from it and sell the cloud mining contracts to the public.\u201d\nFurthermore, Bitmain said that AsicBoost wouldn't be bad for the company\u2019s business model, writing:\n\u201cBitcoin mining equipment depreciates rapidly. Bitmain has constantly been introducing newer more efficient miner models for all. As such the statement that the deployment of AsicBoost, which can lead to a 20% difference in power efficiency, is some kind of negative development for Bitmain\u2019s business model is false.\u201d\nAnd on top of that, the ASIC producer rejects that AsicBoost is something detrimental in itself. Instead, it argues that widespread use of the technology would benefit the Bitcoin network:\n\u201cIf all mining equipment could use AsicBoost, it will lower the J/GH cost and the total network hash rate will increase, making the Bitcoin network even stronger. So, the AsicBoost method is not a \u2018covert attack\u2019 on the Bitcoin [proof of work] function. It is an engineering optimization.\u201d\nSo, in summary, Bitmain admits it implemented AsicBoost technology in its chips, acknowledges testing it, explains that using it in China is legal, says that it is not a negative for the company, and also says it's not a negative (an attack) in itself\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but rather something positive: an optimization.\nYet\u2026\nThe Denial\nEven though Bitmain argues that AsicBoost is a positive on all fronts, the company maintains that \u201cthe AsicBoost method has not been used by us on the mainnet.\u201d\nAs well as:\n\u201c[Using AsicBoost], however profitable, is not something we would do for the greater good of Bitcoin.\u201d\nThese claims may be true.\nWhile the denial seems oddly inconsistent with with the statements that there is nothing wrong with AsicBoost, it has so far not been conclusively proven that Bitmain did, in fact, use AsicBoost on Bitcoin\u2019s main net. And this may be hard to prove conclusively, as covert use of AsicBoost can, indeed, be done covertly.\nThat said, covert use of AsicBoost could in some cases be noticeable after all. Specifically, using AsicBoost could result in odd transaction ordering in blocks, or even in the mining of (near) empty blocks. Efforts to further analyze blocks are ongoing.\nSo far, it does appear that Bitmain\u2019s main mining pool, AntPool, has both mined blocks with odd transaction ordering, as well as nearly empty blocks. And while both of these may be explained by spy mining, buggy mining pool software, or perhaps other reasons we don\u2019t yet know of, the timing and structure of some of some of the (near) empty blocks is at least suspicious.\nMoreover, AntPool\u2019s mining of (near) empty blocks has always been notable, since Bitmain\u2019s co-CEO, Jihan Wu, is one of the most prominent proponents of a block size limit increase: If Bitcoin needs to process more transactions, mining empty blocks doesn\u2019t help.\nAnd when asked about the empty blocks last year, no reason was given by Wu at all. In fact, there is little indication Wu had \u201cthe greater good of Bitcoin\u201d in mind at that time:\n\n\n@sysmannet sorry, we will continue mining empty blocks. This is the freedom given by the Bitcoin protocol.\u2014 Jihan Wu (@JihanWu) March 1, 2016\n\n\n\nAnd then, AntPool seems to also have stratum commands for overt use of AsicBoost on their servers. This basically means that all of the infrastructure to utilize AsicBoost is there \u2014 though it\u2019s not clear if this can be used covertly as well. (And Bitmain definitely hasn\u2019t used AsicBoost overtly.)\nAll in all, there is substantial circumstantial evidence that Bitmain (and AntPool) has been using AsicBoost on Bitcoin\u2019s main net. But as per the nature of covert use of the technology, conclusive evidence is hard to find, and may even be impossible to come by.\nOn the other side of the debate, there is one main argument for why Bitmain may not have used AsicBoost on Bitcoin\u2019s main net. If, instead of the $100 million figure, the more conservative estimates are correct, and AsicBoost for example \u201conly\u201d adds a couple of million extra profit per year, perhaps it\u2019s not worth the hassle. Setting up an operation of the size of Bitmain to utilize AsicBoost does require a lot of complex work, and from a cost/benefit-analysis, some suggest it may be better to skip it.\nSegregated Witness\nAs mentioned, using AsicBoost is controversial; doing so covertly, even more so. And if Bitmain sold machines to customers without the technology enabled, while itself taking in the extra AsicBoost profit, it would be worse.\nBut this, in itself, is not really at the heart of the \u201cAsicBoost scandal.\u201d\nRather, the (perceived) scandal is that Bitmain may have been blocking and stalling a widely popular upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol under a false pretence. The incompatibility between (covert use of) AsicBoost and Segregated Witness could explain why Bitmain remains one of the very few companies in the Bitcoin industry to so staunchly oppose the soft fork.\nMoreover, it would explain why the Chinese mining giant has been so persistent in its demand for a hard fork. Covert use of AsicBoost would be compatible with Bitcoin Unlimited, an alternative protocol implementation supported by Wu. Similarly, a recent Segregated Witness hard fork as proposed by Lerner (the same Lerner that patented AsicBoost) could be made compatible with covert use of AsicBoost, too.\nAnd, the incompatibility between (covert use of) AsicBoost and Segregated Witness could explain why Wu was supportive of extension blocks, a recent proposal that appears to have little (if any) benefit over SegWit\u2026 except that extension blocks don\u2019t break covert use of AsicBoost.\nAdditionally, it could explain why this recent proposal was designed to be incompatible with Segregated Witness. While the two solutions do not need to exclude each other in any way, an unnecessary design choice in extension blocks made sure they are.\nAnd if the reason for Bitmain\u2019s rejection of the Segregated Witness soft fork is not AsicBoost, there seems to be only one alternative explanation left. Miner activation of the protocol upgrade could be used as a sort of bargaining chip, where the mining giant is only willing to activate the soft fork if it\u2019s guaranteed to be followed up by a hard fork.\nIndeed, this is what Wu told Bitcoin Magazine last year, and it is what the company maintains in its press release published last week:\u201cSegWit is not running in production because the conditions made clear in the Hong Kong agreement have not been met, in which we foresee a non-witness block size increase coming together with SegWit.\u201d\nFor more (details) on AsicBoost, see this explanation by Jeremy Rubin, or this ELI5 (Explain Like I\u2019m Five) by Jimmy Song, or this blog post on the relation between SegWit and AsicBoost by Lerner, or the original white paper by Hanke.

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nAt the core of Bitcoin\u2019s scaling debate has been the block size limit. For better or worse, the majority of the discussions about scaling in the Bitcoin community have mostly been focused on this one variable.\nAs an oversimplification of the current debate: Some would like to see an increase in block size which would enable more on-chain transactions per second; others would like to see the block size limit remain low in an effort to limit the cost of operating a full node while moving some types of payments above the base Bitcoin protocol to secondary layers such as the Lightning Network and sidechains.\nIn early 2016, a research paper was released in which the relationship between increased on-chain capacity and increased costs of operating a full node were explored. The paper, titled On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains, explained that blocks must not exceed 4 megabytes if the goal is to prevent more than 10 percent of the full nodes on the network from being overwhelmed by the demands of the network. This 4 megabyte metric is often brought up during discussions around the proper block size limit for Bitcoin.\nAccording to Christian Decker, an infrastructure tech engineer at Blockstream and one of the co-authors of the paper, Bitcoin network communication has improved over the past few months which, the paper explained, has affected the tradeoffs.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Decker to gather more information related to what the Bitcoin network can handle today in terms of block sizes.\nClearing Up Misconceptions Around the Study\nDecker first wanted to clarify a common misconception of the research presented in the paper on scaling decentralized blockchains:\n\u201cOur results are not binary, in that they are not showing a threshold up to which nothing happens and going just beyond [which] bad things start to happen,\u201d Decker explained. \u201cWhat we do is show that there is a tradeoff between block size and the guarantees that confirmations give us.\u201d\nAccording to another paper co-authored by Decker, titled Information Propagation on the Bitcoin Network, an increasing block size will also increase the blockchain fork rate, which means confirmations in the current version of the blockchain become less reliable for users.\n\u201cWhat we can compute are upper bounds on block size, after which the system will definitely become unstable, e.g., never converge to a unique ledger state,\u201d Decker continued. \u201cHowever the tradeoff between block size, confirmation guarantees, and centralization pressure is continuous: Even small changes have an effect. We show that the tradeoff exists and that it must be taken into consideration, but the decision about what the sweet spot in this tradeoff is, is a political issue and less a technical one. If network participants are happy to have a less decentralized network in exchange for an incremental transaction rate increase, that's their decision.\u201d\nWhile Decker said he is convinced that a moderate block size increase is possible without incurring too many negative effects, he also noted that the precedent set by such a move needs to be taken into consideration.\n\u201cThere are natural limits to the size that the network can support, namely our worst case thresholds, beyond which we cannot go,\u201d Decker stated. \u201cAn increase today could signal that in case of block space contention we can always just increase the block size, which is definitely not true.\u201d\nImprovements to the Bitcoin Network\nAccording to Decker, the fundamental analysis provided by On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains\u00a0is still relevant, but there have been incremental improvements achieved over the past few months that have had a noticeable effect on the tradeoffs described in the paper. Decker pointed to Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo\u2019s work on the FIBRE relay network and Compact Block Relay as specific contributors to network communication improvements.\nDecker also runs BitcoinStats.com which tracks the efficiency of information propagation around the Bitcoin network. He recently updated the site with new data that, in his view, shows the propagation of blocks around the network is much faster than it was before Corallo\u2019s improvements were implemented.\n\n\nAccording to Decker, a comparison of block propagation times between now and one year ago show that a 3 megabyte block today has an equivalent propagation time of a 1 megabyte block from one year ago. It took a 1 megabyte block 6.5 seconds to reach half of the network a year ago, while it takes roughly 2 seconds today. However, Decker added that size increases have increased longtail propagation time, which means it now takes longer for a block to reach every single node on the network.\n\u201cBoth [FIBRE] and [Compact Block Relay] employ forward error correction to reduce the amount of data to be shipped around the world and recombine blocks from multiple sources instead of relying on a single source,\u201d Decker explained. \u201cThis creates geographically distributed seeds from which the blocks are then forwarded to the remaining peers.\u201d\nIn the past, Corallo and BTC.com\u2019s Kevin Pan have told Bitcoin Magazine that FIBRE and Compact Block Relay have also led to a decline in the number of empty blocks mined on the network.\nWhat Can Bitcoin Handle Today?\nAt this time, further analysis on what impact the implemented network improvements have had on Bitcoin\u2019s ability to handle blocks larger than 4 megabytes has not been made available. \u201cI am continually monitoring the network propagation, and need to aggregate them and re-evaluate our analysis,\u201d Decker said.\n\u201cWhat is safe strongly depends on the requirements of the user, the tradeoff is still valid, it just shifted slightly due to the increased efficiency,\u201d Decker added.\nAccording to Decker, extrapolating a new throughput limit based on the improvements in how efficiently data is shipped around the world may be simplistic. In other words, a threefold improvement in network communication does not necessarily mean the 4 megabytes number in the original paper would be 12 megabytes if it were written today.\n\u201cThese one-time efficiency increases have certainly moved the throughput limit at which bad things definitely happen upwards, but whether it is at 12 megabytes, I'm not sure,\u201d explained Decker. \u201cAs I mentioned, it's not a binary threshold, just an upper limit, and putting a number on it just does not mean that lower values are safe.\u201d\nIn conclusion, Decker added that there are some types of transactions that will never make sense as on-chain transactions due to the intrinsic costs involved. \u201cThere will always be use-cases which are not fit for on-chain payments.\u201d he stated. \u201cThere is also a privacy increase in using off-chain transfers, since they no longer leave a permanent trace in the blockchain.\u201d\nIn Decker\u2019s view, off-chain protocols, such as the Lightning Network or Duplex Micropayment Channels, are desirable for long-term scalability because they evolve much faster and do not rely on consensus from the entire ecosystem to enable.\n\u201cI think Segregated Witness is both a malleability fix, enabling these higher level protocols, and a safe block size increase, which does not set the dangerous precedent of just bumping the block size [limit] when there is block size contention,\u201d Decker stated.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 12}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nAs first revealed by Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream Co-Founder and CTO Gregory Maxwell, and subsequently confirmed by Bitmain through a press release, the major Chinese mining hardware manufacturer has included the AsicBoost technology in its specialized ASIC chips.\nThis is controversial, in large part because AsicBoost is patented and therefore potentially skews Bitcoin\u2019s mining ecosystem by government regulation. Furthermore, covert use of AsicBoost, as it turns out, is largely incompatible with a Segregated Witness soft fork (SegWit), the protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team. \nWhile it is not clear that Bitmain has actually used AsicBoost, and the company denies this is the reason it blocks SegWit, many do believe a response is required.\nHaving broken down the \u201cAsicBoost scandal\u201d in a previous article, what follows here are some options moving forward.\nAsicBoost\nFirst, a quick recap on Bitcoin mining and AsicBoost. (Skip if you already know the details.)\nBitcoin miners construct blocks of data. These blocks include transactions, some random data (a \u201cnonce\u201d) and more. Once constructed, a miner hashes his block, which is a mathematical trick that scrambles and compresses all the data into a short and random string of numbers: a hash. If this hash happens to start with enough zeroes, the block is valid and it can be submitted to the network. If it\u2019s not valid, the miner will have to try again, for example by changing the nonce.\nTo construct and hash a block, miners have to invest a tiny bit of computing power, hence, energy. In effect, this means that any time a miner finds a valid block, he must have statistically invested much more energy for all of the invalid blocks he also constructed. \nA valid hash is therefore quite literally proof that a miner did a specific amount of work, which is why this process is called \u201cproof of work.\u201d This proof of work is what makes Bitcoin relatively immutable. The only way an attacker can rewrite history is to have access to specialized hardware and invest real energy to redo all the work.\nAsicBoost allows miners to take a \u201cshortcut.\u201d Instead of blindly hashing as many variations of a block as possible, AsicBoost lets miners reuse a certain calculation in the hash process across several tries. This saves some 15 to 30 percent of energy.\nAsicBoost can be used in two ways: overtly and covertly. Overt use would be obvious to anyone; it\u2019s easily detected by looking at the blocks a miner produces. Covert use, however, is much harder, if not impossible, to detect. Only covert use is largely incompatible with SegWit.\nBitmain\u2019s chips allow for both overt and covert use, but the company has certainly not used AsicBoost overtly. There are several indications that Bitmain has used AsicBoost covertly, but the company denies that it has, and it is so far unproven.\nOption One: Do Nothing\nThe first option in light of the AsicBoost revelations is, of course, to do nothing at all.\nAssuming Bitmain uses AsicBoost, or will use it in the future, miners (or, more accurately, mining hardware manufacturers) will then have to gain access to the patent as well, or compete on other grounds. Depending on how much added profit AsicBoost actually provides (this is somewhat disputed), this could be viable at least in the short term. Whether it\u2019s viable in the long term, however, is much less certain.\nAlternatively, the patent could be made free to the public.\nOne of the patent holders, Sergio Demian Lerner, suggested this as an option, though he doesn\u2019t appear very keen on doing so without any reward.\nAnd in their press release Bitmain alluded to freeing the patent too, writing:\n\u201cIf all mining equipment could use AsicBoost, it will lower the J/GH cost and the total network hash rate will increase, making the Bitcoin network even stronger. So, the AsicBoost method is not a \u2018covert attack\u2019 on the Bitcoin PoW function. It is an engineering optimization.\u201d\nAnd:\n\u201cWe suggest working with the patent owners so that the patent could be used by the public.\u201d\nWhile this could be a good option, it should be noted that (contrary to Bitmain\u2019s press release) freeing the patent would not really increase Bitcoin\u2019s security in a meaningful way.\nThis is because in a competitive mining landscape, any energy saved by miners would really have to be re-invested to increase the hash rate. But the purpose of proof of work is not, in itself, finding valid hashes. Hashes are just random numbers and don\u2019t provide security in and of themselves.\nRather, the purpose of proof of work is \u2026 proving work.\nIf all miners were to use AsicBoost, the hash rate would go up, but miners would not invest more energy. In other words, if all miners take the same \u201cshortcut,\u201d that shortcut just becomes the \u201cmain route.\u201d\nAs such, reversing a transaction would not be any harder. An attacker would still need access to specialized hardware and would have to invest the same amount of energy.\nThat is not a problem \u2014 but it does not benefit anyone either.\nOption Two: Blocking Covert AsicBoost\nOf course, the main reason Maxwell revealed that Bitmain is implementing AsicBoost in their chips wasn\u2019t so much because of AsicBoost itself; rather, it was because of Segregated Witness. More specifically, since covert use of AsicBoost is largely incompatible with SegWit, it may stop Bitmain from activating the proposed SegWit soft fork.\nIn his draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) sent to the Bitcoin development mailing list, Maxwell therefore proposed to block only the covert version of AsicBoost (or, really, make it significantly more expensive to use). If covert use of AsicBoost is blocked, it would at least take away that reason to block SegWit.\nBitcoin users can block covert use of AsicBoost with a user-activated soft fork (UASF), which effectively forces miners to pick one of two options: miners would have to either activate Segregated Witness, or they would have to include something in their blocks that doesn\u2019t actually do anything \u2014 except block AsicBoost.\nThis would still leave miners with the choice to either activate Segregated Witness or not. And they could still use the overt version of AsicBoost as well.\nAs such (and as opposed to what Bitmain suggested in its press release), the BIP will not result in loss for patent owners. If anything, it would help patent owners: it would ensure that no one covertly breaches the patent. Indeed, Lerner supports blocking covert use of AsicBoost, and he even resubmitted Maxwell\u2019s BIP proposal using different terminology.\nBitmain, however, has not commented on the BIP so far, and it is still unclear whether the company will support it. (Of course, if the company is not covertly using AsicBoost, it would have little reason to oppose the proposal.)\nAlternatively, AsicBoost can be blocked by adopting the latest iteration of Extension Blocks, an alternative scaling solution proposed by the Bcoin development team.\nAs another option, Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song suggested that instead of making covert use of AsicBoost impossible, perhaps overt use should be incentivized. This added incentive could be combined with Segregated Witness, which could give miners one more reason to active the soft fork.\nOption Three: Blocking All of AsicBoost\nFor some, however, blocking the covert version of AsicBoost alone is not enough.\nSince AsicBoost is patented, and patents are state-enforced, the concern is that this could lead to a situation where mining becomes semi-permissioned: mining profitably would effectively require permission from the patent holders and the state(s) that enforces the patents. This could in turn lead to a more centralized, and perhaps even regulated, mining ecosystem.\nBitcoin Core developers Peter Todd and Matt Corallo, for example, have suggested that the Bitcoin protocol should be changed to make AsicBoost irrelevant altogether.\nThis can of course be done with a hard fork; the initial idea was to bundle it with a hard fork that was part of the Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus (better known as the \u201cHong Kong Agreement\u201d). But since the initial hard fork proposals resulting from this agreement have failed to gain consensus so far, this option seems off the table for now. Alternatively, AsicBoost can be soft forked out of the current protocol.\nBut perhaps unsurprisingly, the patent holders dislike these options, while others are afraid that changing the protocol in response to what they consider to be an optimization would disincentivize future innovation. Blocking all of AsicBoost, therefore, still seems like a long shot for now.\nOption Four: Proof of Work Change\nFinally, there\u2019s the \u201cnuclear option.\u201d\nIn an ecosystem where a relatively small group of people has come to control a relatively large chunk of all hash power on the Bitcoin network, and where either AsicBoost-related motives or \u201cpolitical\u201d motives seem to have played a part in blocking Segregated Witness, some \u2014 like the pseudonymous \u201cPraxeology Guy\u201d \u2014 propose that the best way forward is to change the proof of work algorithm entirely. This would render all existing mining hardware useless and would \u201creset\u201d the mining landscape back to where more regular users can participate, while disabling AsicBoost at the same time.\nChanging Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work algorithm is very controversial, however, in large part because it punishes all current miners. And as for any hard fork, it would require everyone to switch to a new protocol. This is no easy task \u2014 especially given its controversial nature.\nThis article has been updated for accuracy.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 14}
{"title": "Innovation Percolates When Coffee Meets the Blockchain", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/innovation-percolates-when-coffee-meets-blockchain/", "birthday": "Apr 17, 2017  1:17 PM EST", "date": "2017-04-17 18:17:00", "content": "Coffee\u2019s global popularity has a long, storied history. Over time, coffee beans have evolved into the world\u2019s second most traded commodity, after petroleum. Further, according to the International Coffee Organization, world coffee exports amounted to 9.13 million bags by October 2016, the last month that this statistic was tabulated.\nSome 125 million people earn a living growing coffee, says the Fairtrade Foundation. The vast majority of them are small-scale farmers and their families who live on less than $2 a day, the World Bank reports. \u00a0\nNow a Denver-based startup called Bext Holdings Inc. wants to make it easier for those producers of this much-in-demand commodity to garner a fair price and get paid instantly for their beans. As a complete logistics solution, the company aims to utilize blockchain technology to better track all elements of the worldwide coffee ecosystem and thereby boost supply-chain productivity.\nThe bext360 system tracks goods from producers to the end consumers.\u00a0The company then delivers digital/mobile payment transactions to the farmers, communities, banks and other stakeholders through the use of the blockchain.\nThis process begins with the use of the company\u2019s API tool, which allows wholesalers and retailers to embed the technology into their own websites, marketing, point-of-sale systems and supply chain management tools. Bext360 has also built a mobile robot akin to a sophisticated scale that allows coffee buyers to quickly assess the quality and weights of a farmer\u2019s product in the field. This provides the information needed to negotiate a fair price through bext360\u2019s mobile app.\nThe app and cloud-based software utilized by bext360 employ blockchain technology from the alternative payment platform Stellar to create a record of where the beans originated from, and who paid what for them.\nTo jump-start their business launch and growth trajectory, bext360 has raised $1.2 million in seed funding monies from SKS Venture Partners, a company that mainly invests in financial technologies.\nDaniel Jones, bext360\u2019s founder and CEO, asserts that coffee drinkers should be able to know, down to the cup, where their coffee originated from and whether farmers were paid a fair rate for it. Jones is a U.S.- and Africa-based entrepreneur with over 17 years of experience living and working in emerging and frontier markets, including China, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and India. He has deep professional roots in technology, applied mathematics, e-commerce and emerging economies. \nJones says that the launch of bext360 was sparked by the nexus of mobile technology and access needs in developing economies. This, he says, created the possibility of deploying machine vision and AI tools directly into all layers of the supply chain. \u00a0\n\u201cBext360 is transforming the coffee supply chain while bringing consumers and farming communities together to improve product quality, community livelihoods and the consumer coffee experience. This mobile access allows bext360 to implement our technology directly into the supply chain for traditional optimization, product payment and the financing of capital equipment necessary to increase the value of commodities in the country of origin, bringing more equity to local businesses and communities in emerging economies.\u201d\nHe says that there are two primary problems that he is seeking to solve in the coffee industry through blockchain technology and Stellar\u2019s application. \nThe first is in ensuring secure and transparent payments directly to the farmers at the instant their products are evaluated and sold. \u201cStellar\u2019s solution allows us to give each farmer, machine owner and the machine itself a digital wallet to pay for goods collected and to pay any loans for the machine,\u201d he says. \nThe second problem addresses the need to track goods from the point of origin all the way to the end consumer through the use of the blockchain. Says Jones: \u201cGroups working on fair trade spend a lot of overhead on tracing materials. They use rudimentary tracing mechanisms. And it\u2019s very imprecise. People in the field can still get exploited.\u201d\nJones said that his goal is to bring complete transparency not only to the coffee supply chain but also to other commodities as well, including cocoa. According to estimates from the Fairtrade Foundation, \u201ccoffee is one of the world\u2019s most popular beverages and 80 percent of it is produced by 25 million smallholders. [Moreover,] around 125 million people worldwide depend on coffee for their livelihoods.\u201d\nJones sees a number of trends emerging around the intersection between blockchain technology and the coffee industry. The big one, he says, is the demand among consumers to be able to understand where their food and beverages come from. Second, he believes that we\u2019ll see greater access to electricity, mobile phones and development in some emerging markets that have been lacking in those areas. And the third? Greater efforts are being made to track all supply chain data (using blockchain technology) to ensure the full traceability of goods. \u00a0\nSays Jones: \u201cMany importers/roasters want the ability to trace and track their coffee. They have a picture of the community on their websites. But they don\u2019t truly have that last-mile connection to the actual origin of where the coffee is harvested and they certainly don\u2019t do this in real-time.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nBext360\u2019s long-term goals are to link consumers directly to the suppliers that provide the products. He says this quest is largely driven by the desire on the part of consumers to have these sorts of relationships, with younger generations most likely to demand this connection. \u201cUltimately we would like to be a technology company that can improve both the quality and traceability for myriad commodities produced in the developing world, such as coffee, cocoa, fish, palm, nuts and minerals.

Our team helped a big bank move quickly in an area of tech that is emerging and often criticized for being theoretical and too complicated.\u201d \nWhile RBC is still working with IBM on an ongoing project with\u00a0SecureKey on identity management (which uses IBM\u2019s blockchain service), they decided to go with a smaller startup to rebuild their rewards program.\nA representative from RBC told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cWe are working with Silicon Valley\u2013based Manifold Technology on a number of exciting new functionalities that could be provided to clients as part of the bank\u2019s loyalty program, RBC Rewards.\n\u201cThis beta release represents one of the earliest blockchain releases in our industry, which will result in our clients enjoying more real-time data about their RBC Rewards account and a better user experience.\u201d \u00a0\nRBC was convinced that the scalability and security of Manifold\u2019s blockchain was ideal for a program like RBC Rewards, and that they could get all the benefits of blockchain technology without changing either the bank\u2019s basic infrastructure or its customer experience.\nUltimately RBC was convinced by Manifold that their blockchain technology was more secure than any database could possibly be.\nEddy Ortiz, RBC Solution Acceleration and Innovation manager, commented:\n\u201cWe connected with Manifold Technology early in our blockchain journey as they had significant blockchain and security expertise that helped us better understand this technology and enable capabilities much faster. Manifold is one platform that we are working on, but we also have significant knowledge about Ethereum and Hyperledger.\u201d\nManifold Technology Creates Its Own Private Blockchain\nAlthough an RBC official told Bitcoin Magazine the technology running the rewards program was \u201cproprietary,\u201d Finan was able to give us some information about their new private blockchain.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed our own platform to achieve the scalability that we knew banks would eventually prioritize. Based on our security experience, we also felt like we needed to build from scratch to architect a platform that would be able to provide the security and resiliency guarantees financial institutions will need,\u201d said Finan.\n\u201cRBC was comfortable with a product approach, which says a lot about their culture in my opinion, and they liked the robustness of our platform.\u201d\nManifold is counting on their private blockchain to become a banking industry standard, although a number of experts have said that private permissioned blockchains defeat most of the purpose of using blockchain technology. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFinan commented: \u201cWe make no qualms about our belief that banks need a platform that is centrally operated with transparent governance to provide the assurance and reliability their customers have come to expect, while offering the highest possible throughput.\u201d\nShapeShift\u2019s Chief Information Security Officer Michael Perklin agrees with Manifold Technology that a properly implemented blockchain with securely managed keys can be significantly more secure than a centralized database.\nPerklin told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cIf RBC is indeed moving their rewards program onto a blockchain, that\u2019s exciting news.\u201d\nHowever, while acknowledging he is not familiar with Manifold\u2019s technology, Perklin had a number of questions about how it would work, including how reward points would be transferred.\nRegarding Manifold Technology\u2019s decistion to use a private blockchain, Perklin commented:\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s possible to make a blockchain closed and proprietary, but then end-users will have difficulty accessing it from the public internet.\n\u201cIn almost all cases that I\u2019ve ever seen, private blockchains make the application more complex, less efficient and more expensive than a centralized database,\u201d he added.\nManifold\u2019s view is that the current scalability problems with Bitcoin along with Ethereum\u2019s vulnerability as shown with the DAO hack leave the field open to a new blockchain solution.\nManifold has patented their private blockchain and says it is currently working with a large Asia-Pacific bank and several healthcare multinationals to develop an application that will offer greater data privacy and security.\n\u201cWe see the real future of this technology as an embedded service within infrastructure, so much of our focus is now building partnerships with cloud service providers and enterprise data management companies to provide our platform in their suite of offerings,\u201d said Finan.\n\u201cWe also believe our patents are going to give us an important advantage as institutions begin to think about longer-term production deployments.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 18}

In a blog post on Blockstream\u2019s website this morning, it was announced that Mow would be joining the blockchain technology startup as the new chief strategy officer.\nDetails related to Mow\u2019s new role at Blockstream, his alignment with the company\u2019s core values, and his ability to continue his support for an open Bitcoin development process were outlined in the Mow-authored blog post and a related press release.\n\u201cWhat I hope to accomplish with the team at Blockstream is to bring great products to market, continue to contribute to the community, and make Bitcoin great again,\u201d Mow told Bitcoin Magazine.\nMow\u2019s New Role at Blockstream\nAccording to comments from Blockstream CEO Adam Back, the company is preparing to accelerate and shift toward the launch and marketing of their enterprise and consumer products. \u201cSamson will be undertaking a number of immediate strategic initiatives [during this process], including the establishment of Blockstream offices in China and Canada,\u201d Back said.\n\"Samson's skills and experience are exceptionally complementary to Blockstream, leveraging both his deep Bitcoin and startup expertise,\" Back added.\n\u201cWe're starting to see a lot of interest in the Elements blockchain platform in Asia, which is very encouraging,\u201d Mow told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cAs such, we'll start spending more time with local partners there and getting developers familiar with building on top of Elements.\u201d\nElements is a project from Blockstream that allows developers to extend Bitcoin\u2019s functionality via sidechains.\nMow also discussed some of the differences and similarities between his new role at Blockstream and his previous position at BTCC. \u201cThere will likely be some similarities, but I expect things to be very different as well since Blockstream's focus is on building platforms, whereas BTCC was purely B2C,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Blockstream, I'll mainly focus on productization and bringing products to market, while building relationships with our partners.\u201d\nAlignment with Blockstream\u2019s Core Values\nMow wrote in the company blog about how he is aligned with Blockstream\u2019s core values. He specifically pointed to \u201cprotecting permissionless innovation, empowering through trustable and secure financial technology, and transforming the trust paradigm for the betterment of society\u201d as examples of these core values.\n\u201cBlockstream is building a platform and systems where those risks can be eliminated, and where the end-users of the system do not need to trust Blockstream or anyone else to verify that the systems built using the technology can be trusted,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition, the Blockstream team prioritizes security, decentralization, and performance when approaching their work, which I find practical and pragmatic.\u201d\nThis is not the first time Blockstream and Mow\u2019s core values have brought them together. During his time at BTCC, Mow was involved with the organization process for the Scaling Bitcoin workshops, of which Blockstream is a key sponsor. \u201cI plan to continue supporting Bitcoin community events and initiatives,\u201d Mow wrote.\nSupporting Bitcoin Development\nAnother reason Mow has joined Blockstream is to continue his support of the Bitcoin development process. He referred to this as Blockstream\u2019s \u201craison d'\u00eatre\u201d in the blog post, explaining his reasons for joining the company.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that Bitcoin development remain decentralized, and that developers are free to act independently and in the best interests of all users,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Blockstream, everyone on the team has an independent voice, and may even disagree with each other publicly or make competing proposals at times.\u201d\nDuring his time at BTCC, the company began contributing financially to some of Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd\u2019s development work.\nFinally, it appears that Mow\u2019s Twitter antics aren\u2019t going anywhere. \u201cOn occasion [I will] find interesting ways to reiterate my beliefs and intentions with those who disagree,\u201d Mow concluded, adding a smiley to the post for extra effect.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 12}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThe percentage of Bitcoin\u2019s network hashrate signaling support for Bitcoin Unlimited has more than doubled from 16 percent to 35 percent over the past month. During this period, various Bitcoin businesses and organizations have become increasingly critical of Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s concept of Emergent Consensus.\nEmergent Consensus is the idea that the hard-coded limit on the size of blocks on the Bitcoin network should be replaced with a configurable variable for miners and full nodes. Users and miners would need to coordinate with each other before changing their block size preferences if the goal is for everyone to remain on the same chain.\nThe general lack of support for Emergent Consensus among Bitcoin companies and organizations has led some to question why some mining pools, such as Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC, are running the Bitcoin Unlimited software client (or at least signaling support for it).\nTo gain a better understanding of various mining pools\u2019 reasons for signaling support for Emergent Consensus, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC, the latter of which recently raised 20 million CNY ($2.91 million) to launch a new, global bitcoin exchange.\nRepresentatives from both pools claimed that support for Segregated Witness (SegWit), which is implemented in Bitcoin Core and not Bitcoin Unlimited, is overstated and that Bitcoin Unlimited is the best option for solving issues related to transaction backlogs and historically high U.S. dollar-denominated transaction fees. \nBitcoin.com and ViaBTC Claim Bitcoin Businesses Don\u2019t \u2018Support\u2019 Segregated Witness\nIn the view of Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC, support for SegWit has been overstated, as there is a difference between technically implementing a proposal and actively supporting it.\n\u201cSegregated Witness is technically supported by wallets and exchanges,\u201d Emil Oldenburg, the CTO at Bitcoin.com, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cSegWit was implemented in these wallets at a time when it looked like SegWit had bigger support [in the community] than it actually had. Just because someone implemented SegWit into their wallet doesn't mean they support it and would vote for it.\u201d\nCoin Dance segregates support for SegWit into two separate categories: those who support it technically in their software and those who advocate for the adoption of the proposal on the network. Currently, SegWit is technically supported by 61 of the tracked companies and is advocated for by 68 of the tracked companies. There are seven companies listed as opposed to SegWit, two of which are bitcoin mining pools.\nOf course, it should be noted that all companies tracked by Coin Dance are not equally relevant. For example the largest bitcoin exchanges and wallet providers have a greater impact on the discussion due to the large amount of economic activity that takes place on their full nodes.\nNo bitcoin exchange or wallet provider is listed as opposed to SegWit on Coin Dance. In fact, many of the most economically relevant Bitcoin companies, from Blockchain.info to Coinbase, BitGo to Xapo, have publicly advocated for the change.\n\u201cThe wallets we talked to said they implemented SegWit in case it will activate, not because they love SegWit or want it activated,\u201d Oldenburg continued. \u201cThis is a marketing trick from Bitcoin Core. Just because someone says they will use SegWit, doesn't mean they want it or politically support it.\u201d\nRepresentatives from Bitcoin.com did not name any specific companies as supporting evidence for the claim that they only implemented SegWit because it may eventually be activated on the network; however, as Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver commented to Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cI\u2019m sure there are lots of them that implemented SegWit because the censorship caused them to mistakenly assume that it was going to be adopted. Now some of them are falling victim to the sunk costs fallacy as well.\u201d\nVer has routinely criticized the moderation policies of certain Bitcoin-related discussion forums, most notably the /r/Bitcoin subreddit. This is the perceived censorship Ver is blaming for the adoption of SegWit by various Bitcoin companies.\n\u201cThe fact that Bitcoin businesses, exchanges, wallets are \u2018ready\u2019 for SegWit activation doesn\u2019t mean they \u2018support\u2019 it,\u2019\u201d Haipo Yang, CEO of ViaBTC, said. \u201cThey are just preparing in advance for what is needed if it happens.\u201d\nDoes Bitcoin Unlimited Have Any Support?\nAccording to Oldenburg, developers who contribute to Bitcoin Core are trying to pitch a narrative that users don\u2019t want Bitcoin Unlimited. Much like Ver, Oldenburg pointed to \u201cextreme censorship\u201d on the most popular discussion platforms as a reason it\u2019s difficult to tell what users want.\nOldenburg also disputed the \u201cnarrative\u201d from Bitcoin Core contributors that only those who run a full node are \u201creal\u201d Bitcoin users. \u201cThe truth is that most Bitcoin users are not Core users,\u201d Oldenburg claimed. \u201cThe most popular wallet in the world is Blockchain.info. They are responsible for more bitcoin transactions than all other wallets combined.\u201d\n\u201cBlockchain.info supports bigger blocks and wants Bitcoin to scale,\u201d Oldenburg continued. \u201cBreadwallet is the most popular wallet for iPhone users and they also support bigger blocks for Bitcoin and a block size increase.\u201d\nIt should be noted that both Blockchain.info and Breadwallet have made no public comments in support of Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s Emergent Consensus proposal. On the contrary, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith tweeted \u201cI don\u2019t think [Bitcoin Unlimited] is ready for prime time,\u201d back in January.\nAs mentioned previously, Smith has also publicly advocated for SegWit on behalf of Blockchain.info.\nRepresentatives from Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC did not share examples of any companies that explicitly support Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s concept of Emergent Consensus (and not an increase in the block size limit more generally). According to Coin Dance, 27 companies advocate for the adoption of Emergent Consensus, eight of which are involved in bitcoin mining. Of those 27 companies, OKCoin is the only exchange or wallet provider.\nWhy Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC Are Running Bitcoin Unlimited\nAccording to Oldenburg and Yang, Bitcoin Unlimited is a solution to the problem of a congested Bitcoin network, which users would like to see solved as soon as possible.\n\u201cWhat all these users want is an uncongested network with faster confirmations and lower fees,\u201d Oldenburg said. \u201cThis can only be achieved by bigger blocks that currently is only supported by Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic.\u201d\n\u201cSegWit is a solution for malleability, but not one for the most urgent block scaling issue,\u201d Yang added. \u201cWe support Bitcoin Unlimited because it focuses on the most dire problem. And a well-planned hard fork can also resolve malleability issues in a simple and safe way.\u201d\nOldenburg also claimed that most people at the meetups he attends across the world are supportive of the removal of Bitcoin\u2019s one megabyte block size limit.\n\u201cAt most meetups we attend, nine out of ten people want bigger blocks and want Bitcoin to scale properly,\u201d Oldenburg said. \u201cWhen we talk to exchanges we also hear that they are worried about the congestion and high fees. It's hurting their business and most exchanges now are busy integrating altcoins. If [there is] one team that [is] not listening to the users, it's the Core developers who have utterly refused to do anything about the block size limit for years.\u201d\nIt should be pointed out that, as evidenced by this 3.7 megabyte block mined on Bitcoin\u2019s testnet, SegWit would enable larger blocks on the Bitcoin network. \u201c[SegWit] is not a block size increase for the type of transactions that everyone on the network is using today,\u201d Ver said when asked about this point. \u201cTo the extent that it is a block size increase, it is nowhere near a big enough one.\u201d\nAccording to Oldenburg, Bitcoin Unlimited is gaining more support and more people are starting to understand it. However, recent public statements from Bitpay, BitGo, Colu, GreenAddress, Armory, BHB Network, economically-relevant Bitcoin nodes in Canada, and others indicate the opposite trend is true. According to Coin Dance, 47 of the companies they track are explicitly against Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s concept of Emergent Consensus.\nOne member of Bitcoin Unlimited, Rhett Creighton, has also left the project in the aftermath of the recent ASICBOOST controversy.\nNote: In addition to ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com, Bitcoin Magazine also reached out to Antpool, Chandler Guo, and GBMiners via email. No responses were received from these additional three entities.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 13}

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nBitcoin miner support for SegWit has continued to rise slowly over the past few days, currently sitting at 30%, but remains far from the needed 95% to activate the proposal. There is also a growing push for Litecoin, an alternative digital currency, to activate SegWit as well, currently sitting at 57% support.\n\nIn either case, a successful soft fork and the subsequent advantages of SegWit activation on scaling and block size should be beneficial for all digital currencies, merely as proof of concept. Sure, the testnet exists and shows validity of the proposal, but until a digital currency protocol with a billion dollar market capitalization is SegWit-functional, it\u2019s harder for miners, nodes, users and traders to truly understand the benefit. Follow the BTU and SegWit proposal signaling breakdown per block here.\nEven after a SegWit soft fork, a hard fork with another derivative of the bitcoin protocol is not out of the question. So long as there is 51-75% miner support, the hard fork may still occur. Whether the benefits of SegWit are enough to keep the hard fork possibility at bay remains to be seen.\nOn the weekly chart, the price of bitcoin appears to have found support and will now range between the local low and all-time high.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index, a measure of momentum, gives the price plenty of room to continue upward past the previous all-time high (ATH). With a bullish fundamental event like SegWit activation, which begins to solve scalability problems, a substantial jump in price could be expected.\nThe next technical resistance appears to be the 1.272 and 1.618 Fibonacci extensions at ~$1600 and ~$2000 respectively. These levels ought to be easily obtainable should scaling become fixed.\nThe logic for this assumption is that, with the current 1MB ceiling, the rate of transactions per block has effectively stagnated. With a marginal increase in block size leading to the ability for future off-chain transactions through the Lightning Network, the network as a whole would become much stronger and more useful to the general public. Price banging on an ATH while banging on the block size ceiling should be seen as no coincidence. \u00a0\nThe most important active pattern at the moment is the building inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. On this daily timeframe chart, you can see how this is a repeating fractal pattern from the downward move in January. This should signal a bullish reversal once the neckline is cleanly broken. The right shoulder does not need to meet the same horizontal support as the left shoulder and is often diminutive, as is seen in the previous pattern.\nSummary\n1. Despite the growing support for SegWit, I still expect a push for a hard fork, allowing Bitcoin Unlimited to compete with SegWit. How this will affect the price of either asset is really an open question, but should Segwit hold up to its promises as a viable scaling solution, BTU will likely not live on for long. The soft fork vs. hard fork timeline and order will be very important for the price in the coming months.\n2. Bitcoin\u2019s price found support on a previous resistance zone. The next resistance zone will be between the previous and current ATH.\u00a0\n3. With block size expansion, expect the probability of a price expansion as well.\u00a0\n4. There is an active chart pattern on a high timeframe calling for bullish reversal. A convincing candle close above the current horizontal resistance should yield a price of ~$1350 within the next month.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

A multi-stakeholder approach will be essential to addressing intellectual property in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\u201cSince formally launching the Blockchain Intellectual Property Council on March 16, we have increased from 40 to more than 70 participants.\u201d\nMarc Kaufman, a patent lawyer with\u00a0Rimon Law\u00a0specializing in intellectual property issues, is one of three co-chairs of the council. Kaufman approached the Chamber after completing a study on patent trolls with\u00a0Questel Inc.\u00a0last year.\n\u201cI prepared a study last year of patents affecting the blockchain ecosystem and discovered that the rate of patent filings was growing in a substantially exponential manner,\u201d said Kaufman in correspondence with\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine.\u00a0\u201cHistory in other spaces, such as semiconductors, advertising and mobile devices, indicates that this sort of activity precedes high patent risk in the space from patent trolls and competitors. I approached Perianne Boring with this information and she agreed that the players should be attempting to manage the risk before it gets out of hand.\u201d\nPricewaterhouseCoopers\u00a0tracks U.S. patent troll cases and\u00a0reported\u00a0in 2014 that \u201cthe annual number of patent actions filed once again establishes a new record high, with close to 6,500 cases filed in 2013. The number of cases has increased at an overall compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% since 1991. However, since 2009, the CAGR of the number of patent cases filed has been 24 percent, or almost three times the growth over the entire period.\u201d\nRPX Corporation, a firm providing patent-litigation risk management,\u00a0reports: \u201cCurrent data shows that patent trolls are thriving \u2014 having added nearly twice as many new defendants to infringement lawsuit campaigns in the first half of 2015 than during the second half of last year \u2014 despite court decisions and reforms thought to be deterrents. The pace of added defendants in the first half of 2015 was greater than in any half-year period dating at least back through 2012.\u201d\nMembers at the inaugural meeting set priorities and discussed possible strategies for best dealing with intellectual property issues on an ongoing, sustainable basis.\nJames Murdock, chief business officer and general counsel at\u00a0Blockstream, and Patrick Murck, special counsel at\u00a0Cooley\u00a0and fellow at\u00a0Berkman Klein Center\u00a0at Harvard, have joined Marc Kaufman to co-chair the council, which is anchored by the Chamber of Digital Commerce.\n\u201cWe were encouraged by the level of participation during the first meeting of the IP Council,\u201d Murdock told\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt bodes well for the future outcomes from this important effort and we look forward to working with the broad range of participants from across the industry.\u201d\nKaufman told the meeting that the risk of patent trolls disrupting innovation in the blockchain space is of primary concern and outlined some of the possible tools that could be used to manage this risk.\n\u201cThe inaugural meeting of the BIPC on March 30, 2017, was largely introductory and informational,\u201d Kaufman said after the meeting. \u201cParticipants indicated specific concerns regarding intellectual property (such as patent troll risk, and the need for interoperability) and the co-chairs outlined some of the tools that could be used by the players to manage this risk.\u201d\nHe added that participants expressed a particular interest in establishing a repository of patent information specifically for the blockchain ecosystem.\n\u201cDeveloping an industry-led defensive patent strategy is paramount to help protect innovation and drive wide adoption of blockchain-enabled technologies,\u201d Amber D. Scott, CEO of\u00a0Outlier Canada, who works with companies on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and compliance strategies, told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cThis has the potential to be a truly beautiful initiative, in particular where it can support innovation and collaboration. In so many cases, a refusal to license technology or a willingness to do so only at exorbitant rates has stifled innovation.\n\u201cWhile a collaborative and open-source mindset existed before Bitcoin, that was the point where many of these discussions became poignant and mainstream (or at least mainstream for techies). There is a real paradigm shift and it\u2019s exciting to see a group coming together to support progress. We all benefit when we can focus on innovating rather than getting bogged down in petty squabbles.\u201d\nJoseph Weinberg, CEO of\u00a0Paycase Financial\u00a0and a blockchain advisor with the\u00a0Ontario Securities Commission, also welcomes this initiative in light of the increasing questions about who owns blockchain applications.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for the Chamber to bring together global regulators for more cross-jurisdictional alignment,\u201d said Weinberg. \u201cWe have a great set of models people orchestrated in Canada, yet we cannot alone bring that to the doorsteps of other countries \u2014 that is what the Chamber is equipped to do, and is doing a fantastic job of: bringing global alignment to regulators so fluid interaction, production education as well as greater transparency [can happen] between industry and regulatory bodies.\u201d\nBoring said that the kickoff meeting \u201cwas met with enthusiastic support from more than 70 companies in participation.

{"title": "Four Key Blockchain Use Cases for Banks: FinTech Network Report", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/four-key-blockchain-use-cases-banks-fintech-network-report/", "birthday": "Apr 3, 2017 12:34 PM EST", "date": "2017-04-03 17:34:00", "content": "The U.K.-based FinTech Network published a whitepaper in cooperation with BNY Mellon and Rabobank, outlining four use cases for blockchain technology in banking. The whitepaper highlights reduction of fraud,Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, trading platforms and payments as four key blockchain use cases for banks.\nBlockchain technology is widely considered to be a disruptive force in the financial services industry as it allows for the secure recording, storing and transferring of data, which makes it an ideal technology to make operational processes safer and more efficient. \nReduction of Fraud\nAccording to Chris Mager, Head of Global Innovation at BNY Mellon Treasury Services, one of the primary issues that the banking sector is facing today is the increase in fraud and cyber-attacks. \nCurrently, the majority of banking systems are built on a centralized database, which makes them more susceptible to cyber-attacks as all information is stored locally in one place. Also, many banking systems are outdated and are, therefore, more vulnerable to new forms of cyber-attacks. \nBy building new banking systems on top of blockchain technology, the chance for fraud and data theft can be reduced substantially as the distributed ledger technology secures records; it stores, encrypts and verifies every single bit of data in a transaction. Therefore, should any data breach or fraudulent activity occur, it would be made immediately obvious to all parties who have permission to access the transaction data on the ledger. \nKYC (Know Your Customer) \nCompliance and KYC procedures have become increasingly important in the banking industry as regulators are keeping a very close eye on who banks are doing business with to avoid potential money laundering or terrorist financing. According to a Thomson Reuters Survey, financial institutions spend on average $60 million on KYC and customer due diligence while some banks spend up to $500 million per year. \nRegulators want better access to banks\u2019 customer client bases and transaction histories, while banks want to comply with the regulator\u2019s wishes to avoid regulatory fines at all costs. \nBy developing compliance platforms and KYC processes on top of blockchain technology, banks can not only reduce operational costs in these departments but also increase the efficiency of compliance processes and develop a closer relationship with the financial regulator. \nChris Huls, Blockchain Specialist at Rabobank, proposes in the whitepaper that the KYC statements can be stored on a distributed ledger. He believes that when a bank has verified a new client, they can put the client\u2019s data on a blockchain that can then also be accessed be other banks and accredited organizations, such as insurers or loan providers, without the need for the KYC process to be started all over again by each individual party. These parties would know that the client\u2019s information has been independently audited and verified so that no further KYC checks are necessary. This, in turn, would substantially reduce administrative costs in compliance departments. \nAccording to a report by investment bank Goldman Sachs, a 10 percent headcount reduction would be achieved with the introduction of blockchain technology in KYC procedures, which would equate to $160 million in annual cost-savings.\nMoreover, as data stored on a blockchain is immutable and irreversible, the risk of duplication or errors would be greatly minimized. \nTrading Platforms\nThe whitepaper further identifies trading platforms are a key use case for blockchain technology. By building securities exchanges on top of distributed ledger technology, there would be no need for a centralized trust or intermediaries as well as no risk of double spending in the securities-trading supply chain. \nThe risks of fraud and operational errors would also be drastically reduced as the blockchain would make the securities-trading process transparent, secure and immutable. This, in turn, would create a clear audit trail of all historical trades, which would provide assurance for the authenticity of all transactions. \nIf each security is digitized by a trusted central authority that authenticates the security, these digital tokens could then be traded and transparently tracked on a blockchain-based exchange. As the digital token would act as a certificate of authenticity, the chance to forge securities becomes much harder than when dealing with paper documents. That would give securities trading a new level of verifiable trust that has not been available so far. \nThere are already several exchanges, including NASDAQ and the Australian Securities Exchange, that are already developing blockchain-based exchange solutions to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in the securities-trading supply chain. \nPayments\nThe payments space is the fourth use case that the whitepaper has identified where blockchain disruption would be highly beneficial for banks, which is one of the most prominent use cases for the blockchain in banking. \nRabobank\u2019s Huls believes that the blockchain could be used as a new way for institutions and their clients to pay each other that does not depend on SWIFT or other payment schemes. \nBNY Mellon\u2019s Mager considers that the blockchain\u2019s potential in payments could lead to an \u201cunprecedented period of change and transformation.\u201d \nBy conducting payments between banks themselves as well as with the customers using blockchain technology, banks would be able to save a substantial amount on costs as well as improve the safety and speed of domestic as well as cross-border payments. \nThe whitepaper cites Ripple\u2019s protocol as an example of blockchain-based payment system for banks: \u201cRipple can be used by banks for an open-source approach to payments to replace many of the common intermediaries in the payments industry, thereby passing on savings to partner institutions, and thus by extension, to their customers. Thus blockchain can be used to make payments in real-time globally, with real-time execution, complete transparency, real-time fraud analysis and prevention and also at a reasonable cost.\u201d\nChallenges for Blockchain Adoption in Banking\nWhile blockchain technology can provide solutions to a number of issues in the banking sector, challenges still lie ahead for the technology to become a fully integrated part of the industry.\nThe primary issues that the FinTech Network\u2019s whitepaper cites are privacy concerns, integration with legacy banking systems, regulatory uncertainty and scalability. \nBlockchains that the industry would use to store, record and transfer data would need to be permissioned blockchains in order to comply with privacy laws and to ensure that customers\u2019 data is safe. Cyber-security concerns would need to be addressed before blockchain technology can be fully deployed in the market. Furthermore, new blockchain-based systems would need to integrate with current banking systems for blockchain adoption to work. \nRegulatory uncertainty is another hindrance to blockchain adoption as there is no clear regulation on this new technology.\nFinally, scalability is also a challenge since banking blockchains would need to be able to hold and process a massive amount of data. Hence, it is paramount for these systems to be constructed so that scalability will not become an issue, as it has with the Bitcoin blockchain, for example. \nWhile blockchain technology would become a huge cost saver for banks in the years to come, challenges for its adoption need to be addressed before blockchains will become a fully-integrated part of the financial services industry.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 3}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitmain, the major Chinese ASIC producer, has launched a third mining pool: ConnectBTC opened to the public today. AntPool and BTC.com already belong to the Bitmain group of mining pools. This new pool is part of Bitmain\u2019s Israeli research and development (R&D) center, Bitmaintech Israel, and as such, is the first mining pool based in the Middle-Eastern country.\n\u201cThere is a very strong tech and cryptocurrency industry in Israel, and we\u2019re proud to now open the first Israeli Bitcoin mining pool,\u201d ConnectBTC manager Gadi Glikberg told Bitcoin Magazine.\nConnectBTC\nGlikberg was previously the vice president of sales for Spondoolies Tech, the Israeli ASIC producer that shut down in mid-2016. Bitmain CEOs Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan decided to set up the R&D center in Tel Aviv shortly after, where Glikberg took on a managing role.\nGlikberg believes the new pool\u2019s main differentiator is that \u00a0ConnectBTC provides detailed real-time information and analytics to connected miners (or \u201chashers\u201d). This should give them a better understanding of their machine\u2019s performance without having to develop custom internal monitoring tools themselves.\n\u201cThink of miners as servers that are working at 100 percent CPU 24/7,\u201d Glikberg explained. \u201cModern data centers use expensive monitoring tools to monitor the status of the servers, so they can respond quickly when a server goes down or doesn't perform as expected. Most miners don't have such external tools and they rely either on the pool or on a proprietary tool such as a script that they build themselves.\u201d\nConnectBTC will instead be providing this to miners as a standard service, Glikberg said:\n\u201cConnectBTC provides a high detailed user interface, specifying real-time detailed information about the status of each miner, so miners can review and quickly identify any potential problem with their unit.\u201d\nConnectBTC has been operating in closed beta since December and has amassed a small amount of hash power since. Glikberg expects that level to grow over the coming months.\nBlock Size and Scaling\nBitmain and its pools have been at the center of Bitcoin\u2019s scaling debate lately. The company\u2019s co-CEO Jihan Wu in particular is a vocal supporter of Bitcoin Unlimited, an alternative protocol implementation designed to let miners and users change their block size settings.\nAntPool is currently the largest mining pool on the Bitcoin network, representing some 15 percent of all hash power, and started signalling support for Bitcoin Unlimited several weeks ago. BTC.com represents an additional three percent, but hasn\u2019t signalled support for Bitcoin Unlimited as of yet. It\u2019s been suggested that Bitmain effectively exerts influence over the hash power of other Bitcoin Unlimited signalling pools as well \u2014 though this is has so far been denied by Bitmain and the pools.\nConnectBTC was fully developed by Bitmaintech Israel, independently of any other pool. Glikberg expects the pool will operate fairly independently for now, similar to BTC.com. This also means the pool won\u2019t signal support for Bitcoin Unlimited for the time being, nor for other scaling solutions such as Bitcoin Core\u2019s proposed Segregated Witness soft fork.\n\u201cFor a lot of us, it seems like the block size debate is the most important topic in the world, but for miners, the most important thing is to keep their machines running with minimal down time,\u201d he said. \u201cMiners have a vast interest in stability, just like most players in the industry. I think that's why we are seeing a lot of hashing power staying on the fence. At the moment, the pool is not voting either way. I think that large part of the miners are still undecided about the best way to go.\u201d\nThough, as for a potential future direction, Glikberg didn\u2019t exclude the possibility that his pool may decide to support a block size limit increase later on.\n\u201cWe are talking to many miners, and we hear more or less the same thing \u2014 miners want to see bigger blocks and at the same time don\u2019t feel comfortable with any proposed solution. I'm sure that once miners feel comfortable enough with any proposed solution, they will signal for it.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 3}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nOn a typical blockchain, all participants check all transactions. This level of transparency can offer much security, as public verification ensures no single participant can cheat any of the others. But it is not great for privacy.\nFor bitcoin (the currency), a potential solution to improve privacy is \u201cConfidential Transactions.\u201d Confidential Transactions hide the amounts of bitcoin that are transacted; they are currently used in\u00a0test environments\u00a0and in\u00a0academia.\nToday, Blockstream \u2014 the well-known tech company founded by\u00a0several\u00a0Bitcoin Core\u00a0developers \u2014\u00a0unveiled\u00a0\u201cConfidential Assets.\u201d Where Confidential Transactions is specifically designed for bitcoin, Confidential Assets brings a similar level of privacy to any type of blockchain asset, like ownership papers, stock or fiat currency IOUs.\n\u201cWith Confidential Assets, we can generate multi-asset transactions where both the amount and the asset type itself are encrypted,\u201d Blockstream Infrastructure Tech Engineer\u00a0Gregory Sanders\u00a0told Bitcoin Magazine.\nConfidential Assets\nConfidential Assets \u2014 in itself\u00a0not an entirely new concept\u00a0\u2014 increases privacy in two ways.\nThe first part of the puzzle is indeed based on Confidential Transactions, which was first proposed by hashcash inventor and current Blockstream CEO Dr. Adam Back. This was further developed by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developers Gregory Maxwell and Dr. Pieter Wuille, and Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra, and then deployed on Blockstream\u2019s\u00a0Alpha\u00a0sidechain.\nWith Confidential Transactions, only the sender and the receiver of a transaction know the amount that is involved in a specific transaction. A public verifier \u2014 that\u2019s the rest of the world \u2014 knows that a transaction was made between the sender and receiver, but cannot tell how much was transacted: the amount is masked.\nWhat\u2019s clever about Confidential Transactions is that the amounts are masked in such a way that public verifiers can still perform certain types of math on them. More specifically, anyone can add up the amounts on the sending end of a transaction, and add up all of the amounts on the receiving end, and see if they cancel out. If they do cancel out, it means no value was created out of thin air. While public verifiers will never know how much was transacted, they do know the system wasn\u2019t cheated; and that\u2019s all they really care about.\nThe second part of the puzzle, which is new, extends a similar type of masking to the assets themselves. Instead of just bitcoins, Confidential Assets can be used for any digital, blockchain-based asset.\n\u201cWhile the sender and receiver would know that, say, a gold certificate was transacted, a public verifier would only know that \u2018some asset\u2019 was transacted \u2014 in \u2018some amount,\u2019\u201d Sanders explained.\n\u201cAnd if multiple assets are transacted at once, the public verifier would see that multiple types of \u2018some assets\u2019 changed hands, and he can verify that no \u2018some assets\u2019 were created out of thin air. But he would still not know what was transacted exactly, or how much of each \u2018some asset.\u2019\u201d\nProjects\nConfidential Assets may be deployed on two different projects relatively quickly.\nFor one, it can be combined with Blockstream\u2019s existing sidechain,\u00a0Liquid. This is a federated blockchain pegged to Bitcoin, where instead of miners, Bitcoin exchanges and other service providers confirm blocks. Compared to proof of work mining, this allows for instant transactions at low cost, without burdening Bitcoin\u2019s main blockchain. Exchanges, in particular, can use this to let customers move bitcoins between accounts at different exchanges without having them wait for blockchain confirmations.\nWith Confidential Assets, this functionality can be extended to the fiat side of the equation, too. Rather than just bitcoins, exchanges and service providers could swap fiat currency instantly and privately, allowing their users to move U.S. dollars, euros or other currencies between accounts as well.\nAnd second, Blockstream established a collaboration with Japanese IT company\u00a0Digital Garage.\n\u201cDigital Garage is working on a loyalty points blockchain,\u201d Sanders explained. \u201cThis means that all types of companies can issue their loyalty points, and customers can use them or trade them atomically for other assets using market makers. [\u2026] Privacy is huge here because you do not want to be showing the whole world how many points are outstanding on your books.\u201d\nMoreover, a Confidential Assets sidechain could realize a trustless, instant and private decentralized exchange.\nAs a simplified example, if Alice has a bitcoin but prefers a gold certificate, while Bob has a gold certificate but prefers a bitcoin, they can create a single\u00a0CoinJoin\u00a0transaction to realize the trade. Alice sends a bitcoin to Bob, while Bob sends a gold certificate to Alice; both only sign their end of the transaction if they agree.\nThis basic setup can be extended to intermediaries that act, themselves, as sort of liquidity providers or peer-to-peer exchanges.\n\u201cFor the Digital Garage demo we have implemented a trustless, blinded swap of multiple assets through peers already. If we can deploy fiat currency on the blockchain, we can make similar arrangements between bitcoin and U.S. dollar, euro or yen,\u201d Sanders said.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 10}

By providing low cost, assured trust in the integrity of data and transactions, blockchains can make it dramatically easier to trust, own, share and sell services from this exploding new sensing and communication infrastructure.\nThis confluence of new technologies could create a sharing economy in space that allows the \u201cother seven billion\u201d residents of Earth who are not employed by large corporations or government to access a \u201cdigital twin\u201d of Earth to create a more humane and just world.\nBut complex technical, legal, political and regulatory challenges stand in the way. So does the need to overcome the suspicions of those who feel left behind by lofty political and technical initiatives proposed by technical \u201celites.\u201d A substantial and active portion of the citizenry will likely look askance at ever more satellites tracking their movements or property and sharing that information in unknown and possibly sinister ways.\nHow governments and business manage questions such as security, privacy and ownership will determine whether a sharing economy in space enables more just, equitable and sustainable societies or fuels ever more paralyzing levels of suspicion, division and resentment.\nThe Democratization of Space\nOver the last 30 years, the explosion in inexpensive computing devices and the creation of the internet created the foundation for today\u2019s digital economy. A similar infrastructure for the sharing economy in space is being created before our eyes.\nThe first and most obvious driver is the dramatic and ongoing reductions in the cost to launch satellites into orbit by\u00a0private start-ups. The most prominent example is SpaceX, which has successfully landed boosters back on earth and completed the\u00a0first-ever launch\u00a0of such reusable boosters in March 2017.\nThe second advance is the development of \u201cnano sats\u201d that are dramatically smaller, lighter, and thus easier and less expensive to launch than those typically used by governments or industry. In February 2017\u00a0India\u2019s space agency\u00a0put a record 104 of such small satellites into orbit from a single rocket, 88 of which weighed only ten pounds and belong to a private firm that sells data to governments and companies.\nThe third advance is the evolution of new services in space such as\u00a0space robotics. Remote controlled or\u00a0self-supervised\u00a0space robots\u00a0for\u00a03D printing, mining, resource supplies or scientific missions are making space cheaper and much more accessible for us.\nAnother new service is\u00a0Quantum Key Distribution\u00a0(QKD), an application built upon Heisenberg\u2019s, Planck\u2019s and Feynman\u2019s principles of quantum physics for secure distribution of very long (shared) encryption keys. This service will make communication between two parties (Alice and Bob) on Earth more secure and even unbreakable for NSA, GCHQ or cryptographic intelligence shops in Moscow, Tehran or Peking.\nChina launched the\u00a0first quantum-enabled satellite\u00a0in 2016 to test the QKD technology that could one day protect privacy on Earth.\nThe QKD technology might give us back our individual freedom \u201cBecause privacy isn\u2019t about something to hide. Privacy is about something to protect. That\u2019s who you are,\u201d\u00a0Edward Snowden says. \u201cPrivacy is baked into our language, our core concepts of government and self in every way. It\u2019s why we call it \u2018private property.\u2019 Without privacy you don\u2019t have anything for yourself.\u201d He believes privacy is in fact the \u201cfountainhead\u201d of rights from which \u201cother freedoms\u201d flow.\nBuilding Space-based Monitoring and Communication Services\nTaking a cue from the PC industry, many of these nanosats are built based on commonly available standards and from commercial off-the-shelf parts, turning satellite manufacturing from a \u201cone-off\u201d craftsman model to a factory model. Some builders cut costs even further by using components designed for very different uses, such as \u201cIMUs [inertial measurement units] from video games, radio components from cell phones, processors meant for automobiles and medical devices, reaction wheels meant for dental tools, cameras intended for professional photography and the movies,\u201d\u00a0says Peter Wegner, former director of engineering at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center.\n\u201cSoftware defined\u201d components in satellites that can be reconfigured remotely, \u201cApp Stores\u201d in space, and the easier development of custom sensors are further reducing the cost and time required to provide new space-based services. The\u00a0increasing intelligence\u00a0of satellites and the communication capabilities available among them will allow them to work in autonomous \u201cswarms,\u201d\u00a0sending work\u00a0to the satellite that can do it most efficiently or compensating for inoperative satellites.\nAll these advances mean more and more sensing (connectivity and physical services) capability in space with continual increases in image resolution and the area satellites can cover at lower cost across a broader electromagnetic spectrum. Much as the Internet and mobile computing paved the way for the global sharing of skills and services, the falling barriers to space access are creating global space-related supply chains and skill sets.\n\nFigure 1: From Satellite Swarms to Mother Earth\u2019s 24x7 HD Digital\u00a0Twin\nNow, Add Blockchain Technology\nMore distributed, intelligent and lower-cost space-based sensing and communications is a potentially powerful combination. But it could generate a flood of chaotic, unreliable data, and be too expensive for individuals or civic groups to access, without a low-cost mechanism to assure the integrity of data and transactions.\nCommunity or civic organizations must know the sensing data they receive is reliable and that their ownership stake in a satellite (or the data or communications it provides) is secure, and they are receiving the proper payment or services in kind. If a hedge fund manager is to make a multi-million dollar bet on future oil prices, they need to be sure the satellite imagery of oil tanker movements on which they\u2019re relying haven\u2019t been tampered with.\nIf an NGO is to mount an effective public campaign for climate change action, disaster relief or against a repressive regime, it must be able to prove the images it displays have not been altered. Such trust is especially important, and lacking, when \u201cfake news\u201d makes it difficult for citizens to even agree on a common set of facts, much less what to do about them.\nThe low-cost, distributed trust provided by the blockchain distributed ledger\u00a0provides these assurances\u00a0by a series of decentral and encryption technologies provided by the\u00a0next generation internet.\nBlockchain-enabled \u201csmart contracts\u201d or formally verified code in \u201cTrusted Execution Environments\u201d can also allow satellites and systems that need their services to autonomously negotiate and complete transactions based on pre-set criteria such as the price a customer is willing to pay for a certain image or data set and how quickly they need it.\nUsers, satellite owners and even the satellites themselves could dynamically generate new services (such as supply chains in space) and even pay for their launching, insurance and other costs by selling those services. The resulting sharing economy in space can be thought of as an orbiting analogy to proposed FAVES (Fleets of Autonomous Vehicles, Electric and Shared) that pay for themselves through the services they offer while providing social benefits ranging from fewer accidents to\u00a0reduced air pollution.\nBut realizing these benefits requires understanding the full implications of, as well as the hurdles to, this new economic and social model.\nA Sharing Economy in Space\nA sharing economy in space means the distributed ownership of space assets and the data and communication services they produce. In this economy, satellites and their \u201cproducts\u201d would not only be owned by for-profit entities and governments, but by non-profit community groups, NGOs and individuals, or even be \u201cself-owned\u201d by the assets themselves.\nThis new economic model could provide much more accessible, faster and lower cost remote sensor data, as well as low-cost universal broadband communications for previously underserved areas and remote machines: A space-based, shared infrastructure connecting physical, digital and biological spheres for the 4th industrial revolution on a truly global scale.\nThe increased amount and variety of remote sensing data could enable the creation of an immutable, trusted \u201cdigital twin\u201d of Earth, a virtual representation of the real-time status of the global economy and ecosystem, accessible by and affordable to almost everyone.[17]\nThese capabilities could be used for everything from increasing business efficiency to reducing pollution and crime and empowering local and non-profit organizations to protect the Earth, or their local communities, with real-time data about environmental or other conditions.\nAlong with protecting the data satellites created and the transactions governing their creation and use, blockchain technology creates the potential for many granular, decentralized markets for the rental, lending and sharing of satellites.\nSuch access to satellite services (and even to specific monitoring times or orbital positions) could be tokenized and offered on a global market, again with some transactions potentially negotiated by the satellites themselves through smart contracts.\nAmong the potential economic and social benefits are:\n\nImproved tracking of transit, weather and traffic conditions that can delay shipments, allowing shippers to more efficiently redirect cargoes and reduce spoilage of perishable goods.More accurate economic tracking, analyzing and forecasting, such as tracking the number of cars at shopping centers as indicators of consumer confidence at any given time, or the location of oil tankers and rail cars (or emissions from factories) compared to using data from biased or incomplete sources.Tracking of water levels, soil and crop conditions, to optimize use of fertilizer and planting times and to determine the best times to buy and sell and what prices to charge for agricultural products.Real time alerts of natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies to more efficiently coordinate rescue and aid efforts.Tracking of and enforcement against illegal logging, fishing, poaching and burning of woodlands.Tracking of and enforcement against illegal migration.Advance notice of production, demand or transportation trends that could allow hedge fund managers to place better bets on coming price changes. In a hyper-local variation on this theme, farmers could use satellite sensor data to hedge local risks such as weather among local business partners.Blockchain combined with space-based broadband access to make it easier for suppliers or remote autonomous machines in geographies with weak banking, communication or legal infrastructures to participate in global markets.Tracking data for better management of infrastructure maintenance.Crowd funded scientific research to advance education, such as\u00a0orbiting telescopes\u00a0on which observing time and resulting data would be available to a wide range of researchers.\n\nEmpowering Underserved Communities\nAcross the developed world, communities that have been left behind by globalization are loudly and effectively resisting economic, social and technological trends they feel undermine local sovereignty, force change from above or rob them of power and choice. It\u2019s easy to see how idealistic visions of a sharing economy in space could spur fears of unseen, multinational institutions and spying on local communities, selling the resulting data to the highest bidder or using it to enforce \u201cone world\u201d government or regulations on unsuspecting populations.\nTo prevent such fears from blocking the benefits of wider access to space-based services, government and business leaders must sincerely and proactively take into account the legitimate fears and concerns of every portion of society. They must also proactively and aggressively identify, develop and promote uses of the sharing economy in space that help everyone regardless of where they live, their social class, political orientation or level of formal education.\n\nThe massive reduction in costs will allow bottom-up or communal models of connectivity and Earth observation that can flourish outside of state or corporate control. Such local groups can run an \u2018Initial Coin Offering\u2019 (ICO) campaign utilizing blockchains to securely raise and manage the funds to launch their own satellite service. This enables, for example, Low-cost, high bandwidth internet access to remote areas to help them compete in a global economy, reducing the gap between them and more \u201celite\u201d urban areas.Faster access to climate, market and pricing trends to allow farmers in even remote areas to\u00a0make better decisions\u00a0about when to plant, when to harvest, and when to sell their goods \u200a\u2014 \u200aand at what prices. Farmers in Australia, for example, must currently wait 24 hours to get the same satellite data as their counterparts in the U.S. Faster access to such data could give them more leverage in negotiations and increase their profit margins.\n\nThose most concerned about the role of central governments, such as the libertarian community, could use the bitcoin or ether digital currency to\u00a0fund a satellite constellation\u00a0providing parallel financial, communication or data services for emerging markets and physical transactions in space including future space colonies.\nEarth, Own Thyself?\nIdeally, this \u201cdigital twin\u201d\u200a \u2014 \u200athe sum total of all real-time data about everything from endangered biospheres to animal migrations and air pollution\u200a \u2014\u200a can be analyzed by artificial intelligence algorithms to identify threats to the integrity of the Earth and trigger countermeasures.\nTaking on a major job like protecting the planet raises the question of who owns the data about the planet and, even more fundamentally, who owns the planet itself. Is it owned by a few rich humans, democratically by all humans, or perhaps \u200a\u2014\u200a facilitated by a space-based sharing economy and security mechanisms such as blockchains \u200a\u2014\u200a might the planet own itself, and exercise its vested interest in protecting all the living organisms on it?\nIn such a model, a self-owned digital twin \u201ccomprising all the real time data about the physical world\u201d or even a decentralized autonomous organization guided by artificial intelligence could sell data about itself and use the proceeds to maintain the space infrastructure and pay for measures to protect the Earth\u2019s environment. New Zealand is already\u00a0experimenting with this concept, giving a former national park the status of a person, allowing (among other things) lawsuits to protect the land without having to show harm to any person.\nChallenges\nWe believe in the transformational potential of the sharing economy in space, and that some version of it will emerge, and perhaps sooner than we think. That does not mean, however, that its success is inevitable or that its benefits will be equitably shared.\nAmong the challenges to be met are protecting the privacy of those who do not want their personal or commercial activities tracked, and to prevent the misuse of that information without their permission. This may require the option of \u201copting out\u201d of (blockchain) databases such as land use registries, using blockchains to assure citizens their records have indeed been purged or not stored in the commonly accessible digital twin. Another is tracking, controlling and decommissioning nanosatellites to prevent their posing a threat to other satellites or those on the ground when they leave orbit and their use for criminal or terrorist purposes.\nStill others are creating practical, workable management and regulation of markets for either services or data, and developing and proving the security capabilities of blockchains. This includes common, agreed standards for its use and for resolution of disputes and recovery of losses in case blockchain security is breached.\nWith these challenges in mind, government and business leaders should begin detailed discussions now about:\n\nHow to regulate this infrastructure to prevent its misuse by governments, businesses, criminals and/or terrorists without stifling innovation.When and how to eliminate current barriers to nanosat deployment such as high license fees and other funding/capital requirements and requiring operator provide indemnity against damages beyond that provided by launch partner.What types of funding (crowd funding, private investment, government subsidies) to allow or encourage for various activities in the sharing economy in space.Who should own the data, and the resulting analyses, and how to balance private ownership of data one group has paid for against its value to the public.How to avoid the \u201cpollution\u201d of space with inoperative or failed satellites.Whether and how this data, services and transactions should be taxed and which tax authority should receive the tax.Whether and how to prevent simple but effective counters to space-based observation, such as tankers loaded with ballast, not oil, riding low in the water and appearing to but not actually offloading oil. What is the balance between legitimate commercial privacy and public good?How to\u00a0hard code rules\u00a0for the \u201cSuper Intelligence\u201d that protects the planet to adhere to ethical standards.\n\nBuilding the Future Now\nThis convergence of technologies and trends, from falling costs for space-based communications and sensor data to\u00a0blockchain-enabled smart contracts, creates an internet-like standard, scalable and\u00a0low-cost platform\u00a0on which innovators can build radically new businesses and social models.\nHowever, spreading the benefits beyond the traditional capitalist stakeholders to the benefit of the wider society will require close attention to complex technical, legal, security, ownership, privacy and equity issues.\nGiven the speed with which these technologies are maturing, government and business leaders should start addressing these issues before the inevitable unexpected consequences delay the potentially game-changing benefits of a shared economy in space.\nReady to engage on Sharing Economy in Space or build a democratic Digital Twin of our planet Earth?\u00a0Get in touch.\nThis guest post by Carsten Stoecker originally appeared on his\u00a0Medium blog.", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 10}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nBitPay\u00a0CEO Stephen Pair has been\u00a0more\u00a0vocal\u00a0about his company\u2019s stance on Bitcoin\u2019s scaling debate over the past few weeks, and his most recent attempt to further clarify the Bitcoin payment processing giant\u2019s view on the matter was on\u00a0episode 325 of Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin!\nDuring his discussion with co-hosts Adam B. Levine and Andreas Antonopoulos, Pair shared his thoughts on the potential of Bitcoin without any further protocol changes, the issues he sees with Bitcoin Unlimited, and user-activated soft forks.\n\u201cOur viewpoint on this issue is nuanced, and it changes,\u201d said Pair when initially asked about the best way to scale Bitcoin to more users in the future.\nWhile BitPay\u2019s thoughts on scaling have evolved over time, the potential for a contentious hard fork by way of Bitcoin Unlimited and rising transaction fees on the network have turned this issue into their main focus.\nBitcoin Doesn\u2019t Need Any Changes to Reshape the Global Payments System\nBefore getting into the details of possible future improvements to Bitcoin, Pair made it clear that he believes Bitcoin, as it is today, would be enough to completely reshape the global payments infrastructure.\n\u201cIf Bitcoin did not change one bit \u2014 even kept the one-megabyte block size limit forever \u2014 we\u2019ve got enough tools at our disposal that we can completely reshape the global payments system,\u201d said Pair. \u201cSometimes we like to remind ourselves of that. We don\u2019t have to change one bit about Bitcoin to make that happen.\u201d\nBitcoin\u2019s block size limit has been a major area of contention on the scalability debate. Some would like to see the limit increased via a\u00a0hard fork, while others see the risks associated with such a move as too costly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not to say we don\u2019t want to see Bitcoin grow and evolve and become better; we absolutely do,\u201d Pair later clarified.\nBitPay Does Not Want a Contentious Hard Fork\nDuring the conversation on Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin!, Pair also shared BitPay\u2019s operational playbook in regard to an attempted contentious hard fork of the Bitcoin network. In such a situation, Pair claimed the cheapest thing for BitPay to do would be to shut down their services and wait until the dust settles after the fork.\nA contentious hard fork has the potential to split the Bitcoin network into two separate digital currencies. Civic CEO and Gyft Co-Founder Vinny Lingham and others\u00a0have argued\u00a0that such a scenario would be disastrous for Bitcoin.\n\u201cTo just say that due to factors beyond our control we\u2019re going to shut everything down and it may be minutes, hours [or] even days before we can bring it back online \u2014 that\u2019s awful,\u201d explained Pair. \u201cSo we don\u2019t like a contentious hard fork, primarily for that reason.\u201d\nPair added that a non-contentious hard fork would be a different situation. In his view, a non-contentious hard fork \u201cshould allow a very smooth transition from one set of\u00a0consensus rules\u00a0to a new set of consensus rules.\u201d\nThe Problem With Bitcoin Unlimited\nAccording to Pair, one of the key areas where BitPay has changed its stance in terms of scaling Bitcoin has to do with the idea of entirely removing the block size limit. While in the past they believed this sort of system could have worked well, they now see the value in having a limit on the size of blocks on the network and allowing a fee market to develop.\nBitcoin\u00a0blocks\u00a0are where new transactions are stored on the blockchain. A new block is created by a bitcoin miner roughly every ten minutes. The block size limit of one megabyte limits the number of transactions that can fit in each block.\n\u201cWe are very concerned about this concept of Emergent Consensus and Bitcoin Unlimited,\u201d said Pair. \u201cMy sense is it\u2019s not a good idea, and I would say it\u2019s definitely not a good experiment to put on the Bitcoin blockchain.\u201d\nBitcoin Unlimited\u2019s concept of Emergent Consensus\u00a0allows miners and users to signal their block size limit preference on the Bitcoin network. If activated, the implementation of Emergent Consensus would remove a hard cap on the size of blocks and have it set by participants on the network in real-time.\nWhile Pair admitted that \u201cemergent consensus\u201d is involved when making changes to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules, he does not believe this process should play out on the blockchain. \u201cOnce consensus is reached, you want to express that in very well-defined rules in the software about what is valid and what is not valid,\u201d he said.\nIn Pair\u2019s view, the problem with allowing people to come to consensus directly on the network rather than through out-of-band channels is that it would increase the incidence and severity of\u00a0blockchain reorganizations\u00a0that could be as much as eight blocks long. \u201cThat materially degrades the operation of the Bitcoin network,\u201d he added.\n\u201cYou start to introduce a whole lot of usability problems when people\u2019s balances in their wallets go from showing one number to a different number as the chain is [reorganized],\u201d Pair continued. \u201cThat is really degrading [to] the Bitcoin network, and we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\nThe Balance of Power in Bitcoin and User-Activated Soft Forks\nOne final area of discussion around Bitcoin scaling that took place during this episode of Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin! had to do with the balance of power between different entities on the network. \u201cI think that the users ultimately have the final say on what they will use; it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said Pair when asked for his view on the matter. \u201cThe users of Bitcoin are going to determine the future of Bitcoin, not the miners [or] anybody else.\u201d\nPair pointed out that users have the power to move to another digital currency, such as Litecoin, or a fork of Bitcoin if they feel as if what they\u2019re using is not meeting their needs.\n\u201cI really like this idea of the user-activated soft fork followed by a miner activation,\u201d added Pair.\nIn Pair\u2019s view, the way to make changes to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules is to build consensus among users and then allow users to express that consensus before miners begin signaling for changes. For this reason, Pair has become more interested in the concept of a\u00a0user-activated soft fork\u00a0rather than the traditional, miner-focused soft-forking mechanism outlined in\u00a0BIP 9.\n\u201cThe miners basically have a very simple economic decision to make, which is: Is it profitable for me to adopt this new set of consensus rules or not?\u201d said Pair in reference to a user-activated soft fork. \u201cAnd if it is profitable, then they\u2019ll enforce it; if it\u2019s not, then they won\u2019t. To me, that\u2019s the right way to go about building consensus.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 4, "day": 10}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin could soon split in two. If Bitcoin Unlimited miners start mining blocks exceeding one megabyte, these would be rejected by full Bitcoin nodes like Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots. This could result in two different and incompatible blockchains and networks, each with their own currency: Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cBTC\u201d and Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s \u201cBTU.\u201d\nWhile full nodes would know which protocol to follow, for many light clients \u2014 like almost all mobile wallets \u2014 things would not be so clear. One type of light client in particular, Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets, often rely on data received from random nodes. These could be Bitcoin nodes or Bitcoin Unlimited nodes. Therefore, users will have no way of knowing whether they\u2019re seeing BTC or BTU in their wallet interface. They could inadvertently accept one currency, while thinking they\u2019re accepting the other.\nBut a recent Bitcoin Improvement Proposal by Bitcoin Knots maintainer and Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr can solve this.\nSimplified Payment Verification\nSimplified Payment Verification was first described by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin white paper. SPV wallets do connect to Bitcoin\u2019s peer-to-peer network directly, but request only a bare minimum of data. They currently check blocks for proof of work to make sure these aren\u2019t created out of thin air. And to calculate their balance, they check if any bitcoins were sent to or from their specific Bitcoin addresses.\nThe problem with SPV wallets is that they can be fooled by miners. For example, a miner could create a block that has a valid proof of work but which spends bitcoins that don\u2019t belong to the miner. The SPV wallet has no idea that these bitcoins don\u2019t belong to the miner, so it would accept the transaction as a valid payment.\nLikewise, an SPV wallet doesn\u2019t check for Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit. So, if a split happens, these wallets will check for proof of work but won\u2019t know that a block is invalid according to the (current) Bitcoin protocol. If Bitcoin Unlimited has the longest chain by proof of work, and an SPV wallet receives data from at least one Bitcoin Unlimited node, it blindly follows the Bitcoin Unlimited chain instead.\nAs an unfortunate consequence, this means that users of SPV wallets could unknowingly accept BTU, when they think they\u2019re accepting BTC. Their wallet can\u2019t tell the difference, and if they are not paying attention to Bitcoin\u2019s scaling debate, they may not even know there was a split. It\u2019s only when they spend their coins, deposit them in a different wallet or send them to an exchange that they\u2019ll find out they don\u2019t own any BTC; they own BTU. Or more accurately: they owned BTU, and now they have to hope that the merchant, the other wallet or the exchange accepts BTU or returns it to them.\nAnd that\u2019s not taking into account that the Bitcoin Unlimited chain may at some point be discarded altogether. If that were to happen, their coins would suddenly disappear from their wallet.\nFraud Proofs\nIn the Bitcoin white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a solution for these attack vectors. If a full node detects an invalid block, Nakamoto suggested, it should send an \u201calert\u201d to SPV nodes. This solution has not been developed, however, and it is unclear whether it really can be.\nThis explains why some Bitcoin developers have always been wary of the current implementation of SPV wallets. And perhaps none more than Luke Dashjr. (Dashjr even refers to these wallets as \u201cpseudo-SPV\u201d or \u201cpSPV\u201d; he believes their lack of security doesn\u2019t warrant the term \u201cSPV\u201d as described in the Bitcoin white paper.)\nNow, Dashjr is proposing a partial fix to the problem, specifically designed for the block size limit. Digging into the weeds of Bitcoin\u2019s hashing algorithm, the Bitcoin developer thinks he has figured out a way to determine whether a block exceeds one megabyte with only the proof of work hash, and a sort of alert first suggested by Nakamoto (now called a \u201cfraud proof\u201d). While an SPV wallet won\u2019t know the exact size, it will know when a block exceeds one megabyte.\nThese fraud proofs will need to be sent from full nodes, like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots. Once at least about a quarter of all Bitcoin nodes on the network have upgraded to provide fraud proofs, SPV nodes that have integrated the solution should connect to at least one of them and be relatively reliable.\nFor some discussion and more information, see the Bitcoin-dev mailing list.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 27}
{"title": "How Blockchain Tech Will Create a Distributed Future for the Energy Sector", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/how-blockchain-tech-will-create-distributed-future-energy-sector/", "birthday": "Mar 27, 2017  1:45 PM EST", "date": "2017-03-27 18:45:00", "content": "April 2016 saw a flurry of media attention around the first ever blockchain-managed energy transaction in Brooklyn, NY. In this groundbreaking milestone, the owner of a roof solar panel sold a few kilowatt-hours of excess energy to a neighbor utilizing an Ethereum blockchain smart contract. Fueling this development via the Brooklyn microgrid was the startup company LO3 Energy. \u00a0\nToday power and utility companies all over the world are now exploring various ways to implement blockchain technology. Doing so could upend existing models of how energy and utility markets function. Applied on a broader scale, it could be the spark that transforms these legacy industries. \nSo what sort of problems is blockchain technology expected to address in this space? For starters, the technology is seen as a means of overcoming some of the entry barriers that restrict the delivery of electricity to more customers. Here the blockchain infrastructure could foster a more open and transparent mechanism for codifying transactions in the energy realm involving both generation and consumption. \nSecond, blockchain technology can provide companies in these industries with a more efficient way to record and process data, potentially leading to a more synchronized global distribution of energy. Customers would also be afforded a more streamlined and accurate experience in terms of managing their bills and access to the activity taking place on their accounts. \nThird, the archaic and costly function of meter reading could effectively be eliminated while at the same time boosting the accuracy of bills. \nFinally, blockchain integration can provide a more effective system for assessing energy sources and determining how that affects the pricing passed on to the consumer. Better technology tools provide more accurate energy utilization and service data, ultimately leading to better outcomes for the end customer. \nThe broader implications of this would include increased industry competition leading to lower prices, streamlined energy distribution, reduced energy waste and better relationships between utility companies and their customers. \nFor a deeper perspective on blockchain technology\u2019s emerging impact on the power, utilities and energy markets, Bitcoin Magazine turned to Thierry Mortier, Global Leader of Technology and Innovation for Power and Utilities at Ernst & Young (EY). \nMortier says that the power sector is in the midst of shifting from a centralized model to a more distributed model. He believes that in the future new digital peer-to-peer platforms will emerge to eliminate the middleman and seamlessly connect energy producers directly with the end power user. \n\u201cBlockchain technology will help facilitate this process by allowing transactions to be recorded between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. It can also be programmed to trigger transactions automatically. The technology promises to radically speed up transactions and cut costs by establishing trust and the transfer of value without the involvement of traditional intermediaries.\u201d \u00a0\n \nMortier goes on to note that, aside from some early demonstrations, the applicability of an energy blockchain is still largely theoretical. He points to how blockchain enthusiasts are drawn in by the growing complex web of transactions, the need to balance the geographical mismatch between supply and demand, and significant security and trust concerns given the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices. \nSays Mortier: \u201cOver 200 blockchain use cases have been identified already. Most pilots are still in early stages across the energy value chain, primarily in the area of peer-to-peer energy trading. EY is working with companies in the power and utilities sector to develop use cases and prototypes.\u201d \n \nIn addition to the aforementioned April 2016 development, where residents in Brooklyn, New York, successfully traded renewable energy using a smart contract on the public Ethereum blockchain platform, he says that in Australia, several pilots are under way, allowing residents in Perth and South Western Australia to buy, sell or swap excess solar energy with anyone connected to the Western Power network. \nFurthermore, he says that Germany, with Berlin as the global hub of the technology, has a strong presence, as does the U.K., building on the early investment of the financial services sector in the technology. \u201cBlockchain maturity seems to be driven by company ambition rather than any national advantage at this stage,\u201d says Mortier. \n \nHe is especially excited about the emergence of pre-programmed \u201csmart contracts\u201d that can trigger transactions automatically. \n\u201cThese smart contracts, for example, can be set to allow prosumers to feed surplus energy into the grid through a blockchain-enabled meter. The flow of electricity is automatically coded into the blockchain, and algorithms match buyers and sellers in real time based on preferences. Smart contracts then execute when electricity is delivered, triggering payment from buyer to seller. Removing financial transactions and the execution of contractual commitments from central control brings a whole new level of decentralization and transparency that the industry has never had before.\u201d\n \nMortier also touts the rapidly growing prominence of energy trading, an area he says appears to be moving toward a commercial solution more quickly than many of the others. \n \nIn conclusion, Mortier says that there has been significant interest in tracking and tracing resource types (green gas, for example) and in the peer-to-peer, prosumer-led trading. But, outside of Bitcoin applications, he laments that there is a lack of proven use cases, with difficulties involving security, scalability and frequency of transactions as factors that need to be overcome. \n\u201cIn three to five years\u2019 time, it is quite possible that blockchain [technology] will radically change the way parts of the power industry operate. To get there, blockchain [technology] must overcome competition from existing solutions and prove its attractiveness to users. Only if its applications have tangible, monetary or timely advantages will blockchain [technology] be able convince enough participants to ditch their legacy systems for this new platform.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 27}

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nOver the past week, the Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Unlimited (BTU) discussion has reached fever pitch on social media. Based on the current trajectory, I expect the BTU hard fork to occur within the next four weeks at most and as early as this week, though others may dispute this.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited miners may opt to fork with as little as 51 percent of hash power support, though it would probably be closer to 70 percent. As such, we may be waiting for the fork for a while yet. Follow the BTU and SegWit proposal signaling breakdown per block here.\nAs a trader, you need to ask yourself, what position do I want to be in before, during or after this event? As a long-term holder, you need to ask yourself, do I want to liquidate my holdings and sit this whole thing out until the situation resolves? I feel most traders will play this short and many holders will liquidate. We are already seeing continued selling pressure since the newly established all-time high.\nAfter the hard fork hits, it will likely take exchanges and on-ramps like Coinbase a week or more to sort through what will likely be an active and fluid situation. This will be more of an ongoing process rather than a singular event. Miners, nodes and users will need to vote with their hash power, blocks and activity to determine the longest or best blockchain. Don\u2019t expect current market capitalization to be supported by both BTC and BTU: it will likely be a zero-sum game with direct inverse correlation. Depending on how on-ramps support BTC or BTU will heavily influence whether a cash infusion can sustain either coin.\nA hard fork contingency plan should include simple horizontal resistance and support zones using a large amount of price data.\n\nLook for a drop to round even numbers that act as psychological support. Also look to previous resistance levels becoming support. The $750\u2013800 zone seems very likely should the hard fork occur.\nAlthough fundamentals are a bit of a mess at the moment, technicals on the daily time frame are shaping up for a reversal back to previous highs. This chart pattern is known as the Inverted Head and Shoulders, which is a set of three attempts down at an established horizontal resistance known as the neckline (red). The pattern can be predicted before completion but should not be traded until after completion. It should also be noted that the neckline may be diagonal resistance and each shoulder does not necessarily need to extend to the previous shoulder\u2019s horizontal level.\n\nWe can look no further than January this year for a previous example of how this may play out. This pattern took 25 days to complete and hit the measured move target 23 days after breaking the neckline. Also, not shown, the pattern should include a descending volume profile, which is echoed by both patterns. The predicted move is measured from the neckline to the head and projected from the neckline upward. A break of the neckline, with volume, is what to look for when taking a long position based on this pattern. Should the current pattern complete similarly to the previous, I\u2019d expect resolution around April 12 with a target of ~$1350 around mid-May. \u00a0\nAdditionally, there are two sets of bullish divergences on the daily time frame, which can be found using an oscillator such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The first (solid green) divergence qualifies as a bullish divergence because price made a lower low on less momentum, or a higher RSI. The second (dotted green) qualifies as a hidden bullish divergence. A higher low was established despite increased bearish momentum, or lower RSI. Both divergences indicate an exhaustion of selling pressure for the moment. These divergences can easily be canceled should price make a much lower low.\nSummary\n1.

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nOver the past week, Ethereum (ETH) made another new all-time high (ATH), increasing its market capitalization to about one-fourth that of Bitcoin.\n\nETH hashrate also continues to show new ATHs almost daily.\nThis suggests that miners who would otherwise currently be mining at a loss believe in the future of the coin enough to continue spending infrastructure dollars adding to the hashrate. Similarly, Bitcoin\u2019s periods of rapidly increasing hashrate also suggest a bullish medium- to long-term future.\n\nHowever, Ethereum technicals tell another story. Despite making a higher high in price, it has done so on less volume and on a decreasing Relative Strength Index (RSI), an oscillator measuring momentum. This suggests that bullish buying pressure is waning and the probability of a pullback is higher than the probability of continuation. In short, buyers are exhausted. \n\nSecond, there is a Rising Wedge forming, a bearish reversal pattern seen at the top of a trend, with confluence of support near the 200 EMA and 50 percent Fibonacci retracement zone, ~$32. The distance from the 200 EMA also suggests price is due for a reset. This could also be interpreted as price being heavily overbought. It has not touched the 200 EMA since January 9.\n\nThe descending volume profile also suggests this is a period of consolidation. Watch for confirmation of a break up or down from the Rising Wedge with a spike in volume. This pattern should break down but it does not mean breaking up is an impossibility. \nLast, a modified candlestick known as Heikin-Ashi is also showing decreased momentum in this price zone.\n\nLarge green bars indicate strong bullish momentum, smaller green bars waning momentum and red bars a flip in momentum. The candles bringing price to the new ATH were not as strong as the previous candles. Again, this can be read as a type of bearish divergence with a higher high in price but with weakening momentum.\nShould a Bitcoin hard fork occur, ETH may be seen as a safe haven asset for the time being. If so, expect price to easily soar to between $65 and $80, according to the Fibonacci extensions of the entire trend.\n\nSummary\n1. ETH hashrate is growing at an explosive pace, indicating miners\u2019 bullish confidence in ETH\u2019s future.\n2. Price made a new ATH on weakening bullish momentum.

Through a decentralized and encrypted network, the healthcare industry can share, store and distribute information easily and transparently, producing a streamlined system that is resistant to fraud. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, in 2016, a Medicare fraud scheme cost around $30 million in losses. A report from U.S. health startup Color Space Post, a privately owned, consumer-led health company that\u2019s leveraging blockchain technology to develop a new healthcare infrastructure, states that \u201cblockchain technology could make a massive impact on both the administration costs and fraud.\u201d\nAnd yet, even though it\u2019s still in its infancy within the healthcare industry, blockchain technology is already helping to transform it.\nHealthcoin: The First Blockchain-Based, Globally Scalable Platform for Rewarding Prevention\nFounded in 2016 by CEO Diego Espinosa and COO Nick Gogerty, Healthcoin, which won the award for best private blockchain at this month\u2019s CoinAgenda in Puerto Rico, utilizes blockchain technology to allow employers, insurers, individuals and governments across the globe to manage people\u2019s lifestyle change and incentivize the prevention of adult onset diabetes. According to the American Diabetes Association, latest figures show that in 2012, approximately 29.1 million Americans, or 9.3 percent of the population, had diabetes.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Espinosa said that Healthcoin originated when he reversed his borderline Type 2 diabetes. Despite living a healthy lifestyle \u2014 a low-fat diet and running 25 miles per week \u2014 he found his A1c kept going up. This is a blood test, also known as hemoglobin A1c or glycohemoglobin test, that provides information on a person\u2019s average levels of blood glucose. A normal A1c level is less than 5.7 percent. Espinosa said that after deciding to experiment with a low carb and no sugar diet, he found his biomarkers went back to normal, which helped plant the seed for Healthcoin.\n\u201cWhen I saw my blood labs, the idea for Healthcoin was born: shifting the focus of prevention to \u2018moving the needle\u2019 on biomarkers as opposed to just measuring steps and other \u2018inputs,\u2019\u201d he said.\nStill in its pre-launch, Healthcoin will work by tokenizing measurable improvements in health. Espinosa says that users will submit their information through their doctor, employer, insurer biometric screening program or even health apps. As it is biomarker-based, Healthcoin takes in information relating to A1c, blood pressure and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which are precursors to Type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\n\u201cWhen a user\u2019s biomarkers improve, the blockchain issues them a token,\u201d said Espinosa. \u201cThis token is equivalent to a \u2018certificate of proven prevention.\u2019\u201d\nBy building a plug-and-play rewards and data analytics layer for prevention, Healthcoin is aiming to create a network that engages every level, from users to doctors and international health organizations to governments. Through blockchain technology, the network trades in a market for rewarding proven prevention readily, verifying when someone has prevented their disease over their lifetime.\nOnce launched, Espinosa says that employers and insurance companies can offer to pay users a pre-set reward for the tokens while the underlying biomarker database can be mined by the pharmaceutical industry to help in drug discovery.\n\u201cHealthcoin will shift the focus of healthcare to generating proven prevention outcomes,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe goal is to have millions of people generating healthcoins across the globe and thus turn the tide on the diabetes epidemic.\u201d\nDeepMind Health: Bitcoin-Style Verifiable Data Audit\nLondon-based DeepMind Health is planning to build out a new technology. Loosely sharing some of the same properties as blockchain technology, it is designing a system to track patients\u2019 records in real-time, allowing clinicians to predict, diagnose and prevent serious illnesses.\nIdentified as the Verifiable Data Audit, the idea is to develop a digital ledger that will record what data has been used with DeepMind, claiming that the hospital remains in control.\nAccording to the NHS Confederation, every 36 hours the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) deals with over one million patients. However, a report from the U.K.\u2019s Daily Mail newspaper states that in 2016, over 205,000 medication errors were made in the prescribing, dispensing or administering of drugs throughout the NHS, and that medication errors are increasing by 6 percent a year.\nDeepMind Health, which is collaborating with the London\u2019s Royal Free Hospital, has created a kidney monitoring app. Called Streams, it is a clinical application that aims to improve care, directing clinicians to patients who are at risk of or have a serious condition of acute kidney injury (AKI).\nIn a blog post, DeepMind Co-Founder Mustafa Suleyman and Head of Security and Transparency Ben Laurie cite an example focusing on the Royal Free Hospital partnership to explain how the Verifiable Data Audit will work each time there has been any interaction with the data.\n\u201cEach time there\u2019s any interaction with data, we\u2019ll begin to add an entry to a special digital ledger. That entry will record the fact that a particular piece of data has been used, and also the reason why \u2014 for example, that blood test data was checked against the NHS national algorithm to detect possible acute kidney injury.\u201d\nThey add that like blockchains the ledger will be append-only so that once a record of data use has been added, it can\u2019t be removed. It will also ensure that third parties can determine whether entries have been tampered with.\nHowever, it also differs from blockchains. According to Suleyman and Laurie, blockchain technology has some wastefulness associated with it, such as that most blockchains require participants to carry out complex calculations that involve high energy costs. Some estimates state that the energy used could be as much as the power consumption of Cyprus.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t necessary when it comes to the health service, because we already have trusted institutions like hospitals or national bodies [that] can be relied on to verify the integrity of ledgers, avoiding some of the wastefulness of blockchain [technology],\u201d they add.\nDeepMind is also changing the \u201cchain\u201d part of blockchain technology and replacing it with a tree-like structure known as a Merkle tree or hash tree. Every time an entry is added to the ledger, it will produce a value known as a cryptographic hash, which recaps all entries made in the audit.\n\u201cNow we have an improved version of the humble audit log: a fully trustworthy, efficient ledger that we know captures all interactions with data, and which can be validated by a reputable third party in the healthcare community.\u201d\nIn the long-term, the team is hoping to expand the system to individual patients or patient groups so that they can view how and where their data is being used.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 30}
{"title": "Op Ed: How Tokenization Is Putting Real-World Assets on Blockchains", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-how-tokenization-putting-real-world-assets-blockchains/", "birthday": "Mar 30, 2017 9:17 AM EST", "date": "2017-03-30 14:17:00", "content": "Tokenization is the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. There is great interest by financial intermediaries and technologists around the world in figuring out how to move real-world assets onto blockchains to gain the advantages of Bitcoin while keeping the characteristics of the asset.\n \nWhy Tokenize \u201cReal World\u201d Assets?\nOur world is full of assets: stocks, real estate, gold, carbon credits, oil, etc. Many of these assets are difficult to physically transfer or subdivide, so buyers and sellers instead trade paper that represents some or all of the asset. But paper and complex legal agreements are cumbersome, difficult to transfer and can be hard to track. One solution would be to switch to a digital system along the lines of Bitcoin but linked to an asset.\n \nCommodity exchanges have largely done away with physical paper by substituting electronic transactions and standardized agreements, but the overhead of these systems is enormous and they generally rely on trusted participants. Startups and major financial companies around the world are now racing to develop systems for the next phase of this evolution: tokenizing assets. But why would someone want a digital token that represents a physical asset and how can that be done?\n \nImagine Jane is a diamond wholesaler who owns $15 million of diamonds. Diamonds are difficult to transfer to buyers because they require security and careful inspection to ensure that a fake isn\u2019t introduced somewhere in the supply chain. Joe would like to invest a few thousand dollars in diamonds but doesn\u2019t want to deal with the hassle of physically receiving them. and in any event, Joe would ideally like to own a small piece of many diamonds to diversify his diamond position, since diamonds come in a variety of grades and cuts, and demand changes over time for each type.\n \nIt\u2019s not worth Jane\u2019s time to find Joe and sell him a couple diamonds; she just wants an easy way to subdivide her diamond stock and sell fractional pieces of it to a variety of people. Joe wants to be able to easily trade his fractional ownership to other people (rather than just with Jane). This ability to make all parties happy in such a scenario is the promise of blockchain tokens that represent real-world assets and an opportunity to democratize ownership of interesting asset classes. \n \nThere are many proposed methods for taking real-world assets and \u201cputting them on a blockchain.\u201d The goal is to achieve the security, speed and ease of transfer of Bitcoin, combined with real-world assets. This is a new form of an old concept: \u201csecuritization\u201d (turning a set of assets into a security), and in some cases the tokenization is of securitized assets. The rest of this article explores the types of assets that can be put on blockchains and some of the models being piloted by startups, financial intermediaries and governments.\nIntangible Assets\nMany assets are what lawyers refer to as \u201cintangible.\u201d They exist only due to the operation of law and there is no physical object. Examples of intangible assets include patents, carbon credits, brand names, copyrights, etc. Intangible assets, lacking a physical form, may be easier to combine with digital blockchain-based systems.\nThe challenge with intangible assets is ensuring that the blockchain system\u2019s model of asset transfer lines up with the real-world legal model of transfer. There may also be jurisdictional differences that can make transfers difficult (although similar, copyright laws differ around the world). That said, intangible assets are often easier to tokenize than physical objects because there are fewer concerns regarding storage and shipment. \nFungible Assets\nLawyers make a distinction between assets that are fungible and those that are not. A fungible item is one that can be replaced by another identical item. Think wheat, gold or water. Fungible assets are much easier to convert to tokens because they can generally be broken down into smaller units (like bitcoin), and a token can stand for a group of objects (e.g., a pile of gold) rather than a set of individual objects (e.g., a warehouse full of unique works of art).\nAssets that aren\u2019t fungible require an abstraction layer in order to tokenize. For example, a company that will group the assets together and offer them as a package. This is the method used for securitizing mortgages, whereby a set of mortgages that have unique characteristics are bundled together into a group of mortgages with approximately similar characteristics. \nFungible assets are typically easier to tokenize because the general set of tokens are linked to a general set of interchangeable asset components (e.g. 10kg of gold). \nTransfers of Ownership vs. Transfer of Limited Rights\nThere are many kinds of transfers of assets and many types of asset rights. Sometimes only limited rights connected to an asset are transferred, such as a lease to use land for a limited time rather than a transfer of land ownership. Thousands of years of property ownership has led to a wide variety of types of ownership and control such as holding property on behalf of another person (\u201cbailment\u201d). The details depend on the jurisdiction, type of law (common law vs. civil law), asset, and the rights intended to be transferred. \nSome intangible assets can be licensed out to millions of people at once, such as music rights. When a customer \u201cbuys\u201d a song from iTunes, they\u2019re not gaining ownership over the song (a change in ownership), they\u2019re purchasing the right, a license, to listen to the music under certain conditions.\n \nBlockchain projects can generally be divided into those that involve tokenizing partial rights, like music licensing, and those that involve tokenizing full ownership, e.g. selling real estate.\nThe Key Legal Issue: Ensuring Token Consistency \nIn a digital system like Bitcoin there is always consistency. Transactions obey the rules of the software and there are no exceptions. In the real world, there are often exceptions. Gold bars are stolen, houses burn down, music samples turn out not to be properly licensed, diamonds fail to be delivered \u2014 humans sometimes don\u2019t obey the rules. Therefore the key challenge for any system that involves tokenizing real-world assets is to ensure that the digital token stays linked to the real-world asset.\nImagine a token that represents a fractional interest in a set of gold bars in a vault. If a gold bar is taken from the vault, how will that be reflected in the digital token? Who will make sure that the token value stays linked to the gold bars that should be in the vault, rather than the gold bars that are in the vault? Who will bear the risk and how? \nIf the buyer of a token can\u2019t be sure that the token is properly linked to the real-world asset, then the value of the token will fall or become zero (if no one has faith in it).\nLegal Models\n1. Licensing \nMusic licensing relies heavily on paperwork and trust. Musicians hope that sales of their music and merchandise are properly calculated and reported to them. As streaming and digital downloads eliminate physical sales of media containing songs, the music would appear to be a great candidate for tokenization. If music ownership was represented on a blockchain, the many participants in creating the music could have their shares set electronically. The dream would be to have every listen of their music require \u201cunlocking\u201d and payment, with payment then being distributed to the appropriate holders. The holders could then transfer their interest in the music (e.g., if the drummer wants to convert their ownership to a down payment on a house) to someone else, who would then receive the payment stream. \nMore accurate reporting would be a benefit to everyone, but there are other changes that tokenization could trigger. Tokenization of music ownership could allow new business models such as investing in music creation by the public. If a new band could sell 20 percent of their new song to fans, what would that do to the creation of music? How would that affect intermediaries?\nAn example of music ownership/licensing tokenization is SingularDTV. \n2. Trading Systems \nImagine a group of companies that want to trade oil with one another. Normally they\u2019d exchange paperwork and keep their own lists of trades. If they could move to a blockchain-based system for trading their oil, they could potentially reduce paperwork and have more robust record-keeping. There are many consortiums sprouting up that aim to replace paper trading systems with blockchain trading systems. They generally don\u2019t aim to tokenize real-world assets directly, but rather to use a blockchain system to enable trading of real-world assets. This is a hybrid of the old paper record approach and the new blockchain approach. The tokens only have value within the context of a contractual system involving all of the past and future participants.\nAn example of this form of tokenization is the IBM-Natixis-Trafigura oil trading project. There are also tokenization schemes that involve limited use of property enforced by digital locks, such as Slock.it. \n3. Redemption \nImagine an art print by a famous artist with 1000 prints. The art prints could be tokenized by having ownership held by a company that has a standing offer to the public to redeem tokens for either a single art print or, if the redeemed tokens are less than a certain threshold, a fraction of the assessed value of the art print. Physical delivery of the prints could be made at a certain location or shipped to a specified address. In this way, buyers could obtain an easy-to-transfer token and third-party markets could transact in fractions of the art prints. This could potentially be a source of financing for the artist and a way for the broader public to participate in the art market. \u00a0\nThe above model relies on the company holding the art to continue to offer redemptions. An obvious risk for token holders is that the company will no longer honor its commitment to exchanging the digital tokens for the real-world goods in its possession. Another issue would be how the company holding the artwork will be compensated for storage costs.\n \nAn example of this model in action for foreign currencies is Tether, although note that section 3 of the terms of service indicates that redemption is not guaranteed. \n4. Vaults & Smart Contracts \nImagine a vault of gold. The gold is owned by \u201cGoldowner Inc.\u201d and the vault is owned by \u201cVault Inc.\u201d Vault Inc. has a sterling reputation and third-party auditors who verify the amount of gold in its vault. \nGoldowner Inc. could offer a digital token to the public that represents ownership of the gold and through a smart contract with Vault Inc. maintain a public off-chain registry that relates fractional interest in the gold with the tokens. For every token sold, Goldowner Inc. transfers ownership to Vault Inc., who holds it on behalf of the token owner. Vault Inc. guarantees redemption of gold by anyone who can prove ownership through a digital signature. \nGoldowner Inc. can take advantage of the fact that Vault Inc. is trusted (and audited). Owners of the tokens rely on Vault Inc.\u2019s representations and not on Goldowner Inc. (even though Goldowner Inc. is the token issuer). \nObviously there are many risks in the above example that wouldn\u2019t exist if the gold was a digital item that could be transferred electronically. Gold has a physical embodiment that requires physical storage (which also costs money). So why tokenize the gold? One advantage would be that buyers of the tokens could know that they are the only person who has received the token, whereas a buyer of a paper certificate has no way of knowing that the same certificate hasn\u2019t been sold to multiple people. \u00a0\nTwo examples of gold tokenization startups are Vaultoro and Orebits. There are also many related projects that seek to use digital tokens to track real-world items moving through supply chains, where the token is used for provenance rather than value. \u00a0\u00a0\nIntersection With Global Securities Laws\nSelling a fractional interest in an asset to the public (without permission from the government) is often prohibited by securities laws. Given the global-by-default nature of blockchains, this can pose a problem for the entities involved in the tokenization, or the operators of marketplaces where these tokens are traded. These issues are particularly complicated because they often involve overlapping jurisdictions (e.g., a Chinese seller and American buyer).\n \nDigital tokens are linked to real-world assets and ultimately involve a real-world entity that has value and can be tracked down by the relevant regulator. This makes it harder to avoid regulation than a platform that is pitched as purely software, or that involves peer-to-peer activities (think BitTorrent vs. a store selling pirated movies). \nSome forward-thinking regulators are contemplating legal changes that will enable asset transfers to be accomplished through digital token transfers. The U.S. State of Delaware has already begun legislative efforts to enable companies to use blockchains for their books and records regarding shareholders. These efforts are part of a move away from the complicated indirect securities ownership scheme in the United States that requires intermediaries. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the largest U.S. intermediary, currently has custody of over $37 trillion worth of shares.\nFor an example of the failings of the current indirect ownership system for shares, see last month\u2019s Delaware Court of Chancery decision: In Re: Dole Foods Company, Inc., C.A. No. 8703-VCL. For an interesting look at the challenges involved in debt markets, see the 2014 New York Times Magazine article \u201cPaper Boys.\u201d\nThe Centralization Issue\nOne of the main advantages to Bitcoin over non-blockchain systems is that it\u2019s decentralized. But real-world assets generally have a single owner, or a small group of owners. \nMany of the models for asset-backed tokens involve an open offer for redemption by a company that holds the real-world asset. The entire token can fail if the central asset holder fails. \nThe challenge for any tokenization scheme is how to connect the single owner of the real-world asset with the many owners of the token. How can the risk of centralization be mitigated? The answer is typically a combination of clever digital token schemes, contracts, insurance, auditing and third-party guarantees. \u00a0\nOne answer to the problem of centralization is to rely on a centralized party that has trust because it is the relevant government authority that decides who owns what. Sweden\u2019s land registry system has been piloting a blockchain-based property transfer system. Britain\u2019s Royal Mint is also pursuing a digital token plan that relies on its status as a trusted central party.\nLegal Changes Needed?\nIt will not be possible to move some types of physical assets onto blockchains until statutory changes enable digital transfers. In some countries there are legal rules in place that require transfers to take place using a certain form or be registered in a certain way with the government authority that is not amenable to a token-based system. For example, secured lending laws may give priority ownership to a person who lends money and registers that interest over someone who possesses a token indicating ownership. \nTokenizing real-world assets is a challenging problem that requires innovative solutions that go beyond technology. In some cases this will require legal reform, and in other cases it will involve clever combinations of existing legal rules, new business structures and new digital token systems.\nThis guest post was contributed by Addison Cameron-Huff.

The proposed pilots include solutions to provide greater efficiency and transparency in aid contributions and cross-border transactions.\n \n\"The main purpose behind these proposals for piloting our platform is to help developing countries move to a blockchain-based e-government application infrastructure,\" said Willenberg. \"We are interested in helping them leapfrog.\"\n \nWith World Vision and the Government of Afghanistan, the two proposed pilots seek to provide transparency regarding aid contribution activities.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nAlthough it is hard to say how big the chance actually is, Bitcoin Unlimited miners may soon start mining bigger blocks. If they do, they will diverge from the current Bitcoin protocol to split off to a new blockchain. This could also result in two separate currencies, by many exchanges referred to as \u201cBTC\u201d and \u201cBTU.\u201d\nHowever, it increasingly seems that not everyone in favor of a Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork wants to settle for a coin-split. Instead, several prominent Bitcoin Unlimited proponents have indicated that it may be better to ensure only their chain survives. This is probably also the only chance it has to be widely considered the \u201creal\u201d Bitcoin rather than a \u201cspinoff altcoin.\u201d\nTo ensure that only one chain survives, they have suggested that the (original) Bitcoin blockchain can be made unusable. That way it would die off and only the Bitcoin Unlimited chain would remain.\nSpecifically, if miners favorable toward Bitcoin Unlimited are able to overpower the remaining Bitcoin miners with a majority of hashrate, it\u2019s been suggested they could launch a 51% attack.\nHere is a brief overview.\nFormer Bitcoin Lead Developer Gavin Andresen\nGavin Andresen is the former lead developer of Bitcoin Core (then called Bitcoin-QT or simply \u201cBitcoin\u201d). He has since contributed to Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic. He now endorses Bitcoin Unlimited \u2014 though he does not contribute to the project nor is he a member.\nAlthough Andresen has in the past argued that a \u201cminority chain\u201d would be unlikely to sustain itself, he now acknowledges such a chain could, in fact, survive. As such, he noted on Twitter last February that \u201cpreventing a minority-hashrate fork from confirming any transactions is a good idea.\u201d\n\n\nPreventing a minority-hashrate fork from confirming any transactions is a good idea. Nakomoto Consensus != unanimity.\u2014 Gavin Andresen (@gavinandresen) February 4, 2017\n\n\n\nMore recently, on Reddit, Andresen elaborated on what the most effective way to attack the original Bitcoin chain would be. The former lead developer wrote:\n\u201cIt would be even more destructive to mine an 11-block-long empty chain, then wait until the slow chain gets 9 blocks until announcing it to the network. Or keep them guessing; choose a chain length at random, from 1 to some secret N, and orphan that many blocks at a time. Allow a couple normal blocks, then do it again.\n\u201cIt would be impossible for exchanges to know how many confirmations were safe for deposits and would be a nightmare for their withdrawal accounting.\u201d\nAdditionally, he said he wasn\u2019t sure whether such an attack would be immoral or not.\n\u201cI\u2019m not even sure this kind of thing should be considered immoral \u2014 majority hashpower acting selfishly for their own economic benefit (both short and long term) is the basic incentive structure that makes Bitcoin work.\u201d\nAnd last weekend, Andresen on Twitter further distanced himself from a moral endorsement of such an attack. Instead, echoing comments he made on Reddit, Andresen claimed to have merely been exercising adversarial thinking.\n\n\nPointing out all the ways majority hashpower might mess with a minority chain is good adversarial thinking; don't shoot the messenger.\u2014 Gavin Andresen (@gavinandresen) March 25, 2017\n\n\n\nThough he did add that an attack is very likely to happen.\n\n\n@h_msln no, not just a thought exercise, it is very likely to happen.Whether is is moral or not is the thought exercise.\u2014 Gavin Andresen (@gavinandresen) March 26, 2017\n\n\nBTC.TOP Pool Operator Jiang Zhuoer\nBTC.TOP is a relatively new Chinese mining pool. Launched in late 2016, the pool currently controls some 5 percent of hash power on the Bitcoin network.\nBTC.TOP is operated by Jiang Zhuoer, a former employee at China Mobile in Shanghai. Much like several other small mining pools that have appeared over the past six months, BTC.TOP has been signaling support for Bitcoin Unlimited.\nIn an interview with Cryptocoins News in March, Zhuoer was the first who explicitly said a 51% attack against the original Bitcoin blockchain, if it were to survive after Bitcoin Unlimited miners split off, is on the table.\n\u201cWe have prepared $100 million USD to kill the small fork of CoreCoin, no matter what [proof-of-work] algorithm, sha256 or scrypt or X11 or any other GPU algorithm,\u201d he said, of course referring to the continuation of the current Bitcoin protocol as \u201cCoreCoin.\u201d\nThe different hash algorithms mentioned by Zhuoer refer to a potential proof-of-work algorithm change Bitcoin users could deploy if the chain is attacked; a \u201cnuclear\u201d defense some Bitcoin Core developers have suggested may be proposed in such a scenario. (Whether this should still be considered \u201cBitcoin\u201d or yet another spinoff altcoin is subject to different debate.)\n\u201cShow me your money,\u201d Zhuoer added. \u201cWe very much welcome a CoreCoin change to [proof of stake].\u201d\n(If no proof-of-work algorithm succeeds in deterring the attack, a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm \u2014 where coin holders rather than miners vote on the longest chain \u2014 may be an alternative solution. But since this is unproven and perhaps insecure, this seems highly unlikely.)\nBitcoin Unlimited Chief Scientist Peter Rizun\nPeter Rizun (better known as \u201cPeter R\u201d) refers to himself as the chief scientist of Bitcoin Unlimited, and has been one of the driving forces as the project\u2019s secretary.\nLast week, Rizun, along with bitcoin.com business developer Jake Smith, visited the offices of Coinbase and BitPay to promote Bitcoin Unlimited. Coming back from these visits, Rizun published a blog post on Medium. The message Rizun said he had gotten from these companies is that a hard fork to larger blocks should be \u201cdecisive and absolute.\u201d\nRizun described three levels of \u201canti-split protection\u201d that could accomplish this. The first is an explanation of how mining would probably be unprofitable on the original Bitcoin chain \u2014 decreasing the odds of the chain surviving in the first place.\nThe second level, however, is a type of 51% attack on a minority of miners. Once a majority of hash power signals support for Bitcoin Unlimited, Rizun wrote, the majority could reject (\u201corphan\u201d) any blocks that do not signal this support.\n\u201cMiners will orphan the blocks of non-compliant miners prior to the first larger block to serve as a reminder to upgrade. Simply due to the possibility of having blocks orphaned, all miners would be motivated to begin signaling for larger blocks once support definitively passes 51%. If some miners hold out (e.g., they may not be paying attention regarding the upgrade), then they will begin to pay attention after losing approximately $15,000 of revenue due to an orphaned block.\u201d\n(It should be noted that this attack can be trivially subverted. Especially now that the attack is known, miners can, and probably will, signal fake support. Indeed, at least one small pool has literally \u201csignaled support\u201d with a poop emoticon.)\nIf the original Bitcoin blockchain survives even after these two levels, Rizun explained that a subset of miners in favor of Bitcoin Unlimited could disrupt this chain by exclusively producing empty blocks on the original chain. This would prevent any and all transactions from confirming as long as the attack is ongoing.\n\u201cTo address the risk of coins being spent on this chain (replay risk), majority miners will deploy hash power as needed to ensure the minority chain includes only empty blocks after the forking point.\u201d\nAnd in line with the strategy described by Gavin Andresen:\n\u201cThis can easily be accomplished if the majority miners maintain a secret chain of empty blocks \u200a\u2014 \u200abuilt off their last empty block \u200a\u2014 \u200apublishing only as much of this chain as necessary to orphan any non-empty blocks produced on the minority chain.\u201d\n(This attack can be waited out until the attacker\u2019s funds run out, and perhaps dismantled altogether. Discussion on potential strategies is ongoing on the Bitcoin-development mailing list. And of course, there is the potential of a proof-of-work algorithm change.)\nWhile noting that he doesn\u2019t necessarily endorse the strategy, Rizun predicted that a coin-split would be avoided in this way: a \u201csafe upgrade procedure,\u201d he later noted on Reddit.\nRizun also submitted his ideas to the Bitcoin-development mailing list. (Where it was, unsurprisingly, forcefully dismissed.)\nBitmain Co-CEO Jihan Wu\nJihan Wu is the co-CEO of Chinese ASIC-hardware producer Bitmain. AntPool is Bitmain\u2019s mining pool, and BTC.com, another mining pool, is a subsidiary of Bitmain.\nWu is a vocal proponent of Bitcoin Unlimited as well, and announced to Bloomberg that he would switch the hash power in his pool to Bitcoin Unlimited in anticipation of a hard fork \u2014 which he has since indeed done. (Though, notably, BTC.com has not.)\nAnd in an interview with Forbes, Wu said he wouldn\u2019t rule out attacking the Bitcoin blockchain, or, \u201cundermining Core\u201d as it is described in the article.\n\u201cIt may not be necessary to attack it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to attack it is always an option.\u201d\nThanks to Libbitcoin lead developer Eric Voskuil for feedback.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 29}

Additionally, Americans want limits set on the amount drug companies can charge for high-cost drugs, such as those to treat cancer. \nPrescription costs for seniors seem to be garnering the most attention. Many on Medicare Part D experience what is known as the \u201cdoughnut hole,\u201d a term that\u2019s used to describe a medication coverage gap. All Part D patients begin each year with a deductible amount, which, once hit, triggers coverage for medications. However, when that coverage amount is exhausted, patients begin paying for their medications at the much higher retail rate \u2014 often 5 to 10 times the covered costs. \nThe continued escalation of costs across all stratas of the U.S. population has been a key discussion point in efforts to revamp the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The prevailing message: drugs don\u2019t work if patients can\u2019t afford them. Even President Trump has chimed in, saying that drug companies are \u201cgetting away with murder.\u201d And in a speech to Congress that garnered bipartisan support, he said that his administration and Congress should \u201cshould work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.\u201d\nBringing Blockchain Technology Into the Conversation\nBrennan Bennett, a pharmacy point-of-care expert and editor of Blockchain Healthcare Review, says one of the biggest issues related to drug costs is the research and development expenses associated with every failed drug formulary. He notes that it can take nearly a decade and several billion dollars to bring a new drug to market, and that\u2019s if the clinical trials and paperwork fall within average timetables. Moreover, formulary patents for those that make it through last 20 years, meaning there are no cost-effective off-brands to counterbalance the premium brand.\nAnother major roadblock according to Bennett is the influence of pharma lobbyists on lawmakers, particularly with prescription issues that might involve some sort of legal stigmas. He cites for example a 2016 congressional action blocking the Veterans Administration from being able to prescribe medical cannabis for vets with injuries and PTSD, versus Oxycontin and Xanax, both of which are both highly addictive and expensive. \nBut in his view the biggest issue in the whole prescription price debate is fraud. Says Bennett: \u201cI heard at the recent Healthcare Blockchain Summit just this month that 1:100 drugs in America are counterfeit. I can\u2019t say as to if that included over-the-counters, but, really, that would be irrelevant given the size and scope of this number.\u201d\nHe believes blockchain technology could play a valuable role in addressing this issue by integrating with Internet of Things (IoT) devices to ensure a tamper-proof model throughout the supply chain. Says Bennett: \u201cTo achieve this entire chain of custody with a blockchain security\u2013enabled system, a big pharma company would need to deploy a permissioned blockchain to handle their own internal chain of custody. At that point, they could share data with other permissioned blockchains run by the organizations that transport and distribute the drugs.\u201d \nBennett believes that the biggest barriers to blockchain adoption in this space are IP security concerns. \u201cNobody wants to adopt just yet because the data governance capability that would allow collaboration among blockchain-enabled pharma systems to share the data needed to drive down costs is still relatively immature. IP security is directly correlated with network security. So an entanglement of permissioned blockchains would need serious security.\u201d\nA Lack of Existing Major Players?\nIn terms of promising blockchain use cases, Bennett remarked that is he not aware of any that are \u201cend-to-end,\u201d meaning molecular modeling to retail shelf. \u201cI will be participating in a panel discussion at the Johns Hopkins campus in June that will specifically be addressing what a major player would need to bring to the table in order to address the enterprise pharmacy space. If any do exist, I hope they\u2019ll consider sharing their knowledge.\u201d \nHe went on to note that there are plenty of applications being developed for specific pharmacy business operations in terms of interaction with other points of patient care, but that pharmacy supply chain management is going to have to integrate with a variety of blockchain applications to secure the whole process, the IoT being the biggest.\nAmid talk about blockchain advancements in the pharmaceutical industry, Bennett had this to say: \n\u201cMore and more of the patients in my pharmacy practice area are obtaining medications from Mexico and Canada. Patients are finding international pharmacies online. There are even organized bus trips across the border for drug purchases. I\u2019ve even gotten reports from my patients of incredible savings on a brand-name product in the same packaging and same manufacturing plant. Why the costs to the American consumer are consistently at such an outrageously inflated rate compared with other countries is not well explained from any source I have found.\u201d \nBennett is hopeful that pharmacy physical supply chain management use cases will evolve rapidly, learning from and mimicking other current supply chain management blockchain examples involving tangible items, such as food. He states that a number of blockchain use cases are popping up that address specific choke points in pharmacy costs like clinical trials. \n\u201cOverall, the conversion of precision science, blockchain platforms, smart contracts on permissioned networks and A.I is where I think we are going to see the next macro evolution in modern science. And frankly I believe there is no better place for pharma to lead the way.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 28}

The company uses smart contract capabilities on the Ethereum blockchain to create crypto assets backed by real estate, allowing holders to gain exposure to real estate and profit from rental income and capital appreciation of underlying properties.\n \n\"We want to [offer] democratized property opportunities, to be accessible by everyone, wherever they are,\" Darvin Kurniawan, founder and CEO of REIDAO, told Bitcoin Magazine.\n \nThe real estate market has plenty of opportunities for making big gains. However, buying and owning real estate remains complicated and is reserved for the few who can afford to enter into real estate investments.\n \nREIDAO seeks to provide solutions to the current issues and limitations and bring new investment opportunities.\n \nKurniawan recalled his earlier days as a new graduate when he was considering investing in Singapore's booming real estate market.\n \n\"I identified a few opportunities, unfortunately I couldn't enter alone \u2014 huge amount of upfront capital was needed to acquire just one property,\" he explained.\n \n\"So back then I and a few friends tried to pool resources together, to acquire just one property. A lot of work, a lot of hassles, and especially a lot of trust. I wanted something simpler, but there just wasn't any.\n \n\"I tried to solve this problem for a long time, and when blockchain technology came along with its trust-less properties, I thought 'this is it!' Now quite literally you can pool resources together with a lot of other people that you don't know to buy a single property. No trust needed among the participants.\"\n \nBlockchain for Real Estate\n \nUsing blockchain technology to digitalize real estate ownership can transform the industry landscape, enabling a greater number of people to access real estate investing, lowering entry barriers and making the market much more liquid.\n \nBlockchains can be used to create and distribute digital tokens that represent ownership of a property. The value of a particular token would be backed with physical real estate, and these tokens would be issued to each participant and owners.\n \nIn the case of REIDAO, every property listed on the platform is assigned a unique Token ID. Every Token ID has its own cap of tokens available, its own valuation based on the property that is backing it, and its own track record.\n \n\"By buying and selling these tokens, people are, in a way, buying and selling fractions of the underlying property. We have created a structure including Public Trust Company to create the link between the tokens and the actual properties,\" said Kurniawan.\n \nIndividuals that hold a certain number of tokens of a particular property are eligible for the income generated by the property. This can be rental incomes or simply capital appreciation.\n \nKuala Lumpur Properties\n \n\u201cREIDAO is set to launch its proof-of-concept in the second half of the year. People interested in the concept will be able to participate in a \u2018crowd-buy\u2019 for the first few properties listed on REIDAO,\u201d Kurniawan said.\n \nThe company will first begin with properties in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia where real estate prices are still relatively affordable. \"We have set up the necessary partnerships in Malaysia to pull this off,\" he indicated.\n \nIn the long-term, Kurniawan envisions a \"Property Tokens Exchange Board,\" which would be similar to a stock exchange, but for property tokens.\n \n\"If anyone has extra money that they want to invest in real estate, this will be a new and simple option for them, especially with the low barrier to entry.\n \n\"If you are feeling adventurous, buy a few property tokens backed by a property in Cambodia. If you are feeling cautious and want something safe, buy a few property tokens for a property in Japan. If you are feeling lucky, you can consider a few property tokens backed by a distressed property in Greece,\" said Kurniawan.\n \nGoing further, he sees some kind of real estate investment trust but \"with tokens as one of the distribution channels.\"\n \n\"To do this, we will need to have key partnerships with established companies that are already in that industry, to extend their capabilities to include the blockchain,\" he said.\n \nNUS Enterprise\n \nREIDAO joined the Lean LaunchPad Program by NUS Enterprise, the entrepreneurship arm of the National University of Singapore, an opportunity for the startup to validate its proposition and turn the concept into a commercially viable product.\n \n\"It is imperative for a [startup like ours] to validate what we are doing and to build something that somebody wants to use,\" said Kurniawan. \"Even more importantly when we are deal with a new technology like blockchain.\"\n \n\"Our target market constitutes mainstream users who might not have heard about Bitcoin, let alone the blockchain. We need to be able to really understand what they are looking for, and how we can get them to want to use the platform without much hassle.\"\n \nREIDAO is working with Digix Global, another Singaporean startup, to allow people to invest in its properties using gold-backed digital tokens. The company will incorporate Digix Global's DGX token as its main medium of exchange.\n \n\"It is easier to tell the mainstream non-technical users that they will be buying properties using gold, and if there is any income they will also be paid in gold, rather than explaining about ether or bitcoin,\" said Kurniawan.\n \nREIDAO is planning an initial coin offering to raise capital to support development. A capital injection would also allow the company to start exploring other markets beyond Malaysia.\n \n\"We have a few jurisdictions in mind that we can expand to, and each one will have its own local rules and regulations which needs to be iron out independently, and the cost to do that really adds up,\" said Kurniawan.\n \n\"Before all that could happen though, we need to be able to pull off the Proof of Concept for the properties in our first jurisdiction \u2014 Malaysia.

The new platform will allow crude oil transactions to be digitized to ensure more transparency and efficiency as well as improved security in the trade finance process. \nThe new platform is built on the Linux Foundation\u2019s Hyperledger Fabric blockchain and will allow all stakeholders in a crude oil transaction to view and share data on the status of the transaction throughout its entire process.\nBy using the new distributed ledger platform, crude oil trade finance industry participants will benefit from improved efficiency through lower overhead costs and few intermediaries, a reduction in cash cycle times, increased transaction transparency to reduce the potential of fraud or tampering with documents, and the ability to audit the entire transaction process through the use of shared processes and record-keeping. \n\u201cWe have chosen the Hyperledger Fabric but we have put on top of it our own platform/application with our industry-specific purpose (with IBM and Natixis developers),\u201d Arnaud Stevens, Natixis\u2019s New York Head of Global Energy & Commodities, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThis prototype has been built in a robust technology environment providing security, confidentiality, auditability, reliability and scalability. And Natixis continues to test and to work on the different distributed ledger technologies (Corda, Ethereum, in addition to Hyperledger Fabric) with its own projects and with other banks (R3).\u201d\nUp until now, commodity trade finance transactions have relied heavily on paper documentation, which often leads to delays and human errors and opens up the potential of fraud and lost documentation. By digitizing all involved documents, including trade documents, shipment updates and delivery and payment status, and enabling them to be stored in a shared ledger, every trade transaction can be executed in a much more efficient and transparent manner. \nThe new distributed ledger platform used by the French bank Natixis and the commodity trading company Trafigura is hosted on IBM\u2019s Bluemix cloud platform, which was delivered by IBM France. \nIn the future, the platform will be expanded to enable all stakeholders in a crude oil trade finance transaction to enter data directly onto the distributed ledger, which will provide real-time status updates to all transaction participants to ensure that the transaction is processing smoothly and without the risk of fraud. \nFurthermore, the new trade finance platform has been designed for large-scale adoption by the entire industry via a shared permissioned ledger that all trading partners have access to. \n\u201cTogether with Natixis and IBM, we have analyzed the workflow of crude oil transactions in the U.S., detailing the different steps of a transaction, our interactions with the financial institutions and the documents exchanged among the various parties,\u201d said Rodney Malcolm, CFO of Trafigura Trading North America. \u201cThe goal is to replace paper-heavy manual processes with blockchain-based workflows to improve transparency and data sharing. With the distributed ledger technology, all transaction participants in the network are updated simultaneously with a record that cannot be altered or tampered with.\u201d\n \nFurthermore, Malcolm told Bitcoin Magazine that Trafigura was brought into the project as Natixis and IBM were already in the process of developing a blockchain solution for the oil trade and were looking for a leader in the U.S. oil trading business to be a participant in the concept trial. \nStevens suggested that it may be at least another year before the technology is ready to go into production mode.\n\u201cWe had begun to discuss the use of blockchain [technology] with Trafigura\u2019s peers in the U.S. as well as other commodity banks, and we see a clear interest in testing the technology,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe would like to get into production mode as soon as possible, but it will not be before 2018. The industry is looking for significant advancements in efficiency, transparency and security. Adoption of blockchain technology could enable faster, permissioned, immutable, transparent and auditable business-to-business interactions between companies and their business partners in the energy and commodity industry.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cBlockchain [technology] is a team sport; it\u2019s about operating a business network, and we would like to invite the key players in the commodity trading space in the U.S. to join this initiative to create an industry-specific platform.

He points out that one of the biggest expenses in addition to brick-and-mortar infrastructure is staff onboarding to review the applications of the clients. A key factor is the extent to which it can be automated and made autonomously intelligent in a blockchain smart contract for things like lending applications. \nSpoke says that he and his team are also looking to establish a footprint with modern energy grids in a way that will bring about new levels of efficiency by autonomously trading electricity amongst all of its users in real time. \nBlockchain as a Tool for Transparency\nSpoke also believes that from a regulatory perspective, blockchain technology will offer better tools for regulators to more effectively do their jobs because of access to real-time information. He also sees it as a way to counter corruption. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to prove that there is a right way to track information and transactions to create immutable records of truth. And once we get there, there won\u2019t be any going backward because a new standard of proof will have been established \u2014 one that will permeate through every digital system moving forward.\u201d \u00a0\nSpoke believes that blockchain technology\u2019s ability to achieve consensus among interacting parties without utilizing a centralized authority model is a particularly big breakthrough, with far-reaching implications in a multitude of domains. \nHe credits his team of advisors, which includes Ethereum mastermind Vitalik Buterin and blockchain thought leader Alex Tapscott, as pivotal to Nuco remaining on track relative to its progression in this space.\n\u201cVitalik of course has led the efforts to shape the Ethereum for Enterprise ecosystem. His knowledge of our product roadmap helps The Ethereum Foundation to collaborate and deliver on enterprise-centric features that will benefit Nuco\u2019s platform and offerings. It also enables us to leverage on Ethereum\u2019s vast user and developer base. \n\u201cAnd Alex, as a globally recognized thought leader on blockchain tech and the co-author of the bestselling book \u2018Blockchain Revolution,\u2019 has been great about raising awareness on blockchain [technology] and Nuco, thus expanding our global exposure.\u201d\nIn terms of emerging trends for the enterprise blockchain space over the next 12 to 18 months, Spoke cited three:\n1. The development of dApps (decentralized applications) on public networks.\n2. Increased investments and implementations within the blockchain space, with many companies building prototypes and proof-of-concepts (POCs) to integrate with existing legacy systems.\n3. The shaping of open standards focused on legal and regulatory compliance.\nSpoke said that while markets are generally in agreement on blockchain technology playing a major enterprise-related role in the years ahead, technology has just come out of its inception stage. \n\u201cWe are starting to witness the first hints of solutions getting closer to production. Seeing some traditional companies convert their status quo business models onto a blockchain system is going to be a step forward. I believe that we\u2019ll see more and more of this as 2017 progresses.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 17}

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nCurrently, there is growing support to split Bitcoin into two different currencies via a hard fork: Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) and Bitcoin Core. BU would remove the 1MB block size ceiling entirely. There is also another proposal, Segregated Witness (SegWit), which would be adopted through a soft fork and raise the block size ceiling to ~4MB and also allow for further protocol improvements like Lightning Network which would reduce the burden on block size even further with off-chain open payment channels.\nFrom a trading perspective, a hard fork creates great uncertainty in the near to medium term future. Ethereum is an example of a digital currency with a large market capitalization, currently at $3.9 billion, which went through a total of four hard forks, one of which split the currency into Ethereum Classic, which continues to be actively mined and traded. Although Ethereum recently made new all-time highs (ATH) in price and market capitalization, 2016 was a bearish year overall for the currency.\nIt is unknown how a hard fork would affect Bitcoin price, a digital currency with $17\u201320 billion market capitalization, but don\u2019t expect traders to welcome the move with open arms. It\u2019s possible that the hard fork reality is already being priced in, but the full ramifications of two different Bitcoins won\u2019t be known until after the hard fork occurs. Uncertainty generally creates bearish price action, and uncertainty regarding the underlying principles of the Bitcoin protocol certainly has many traders and investors concerned.\nAlthough BU could split off at any time, it is more likely that the hard fork would occur between at 51\u201375% miner support. Follow the BU and SegWit proposal signalling breakdown per block here.\nIt is important to have a trading plan for every possibility and, because a hard fork is becoming more and more likely at this point, finding support zones on high time frames is important. Using information from the entire trend so far, beginning in late 2015, we can find these zones.\n\nThe most basic support can be found drawing a simple diagonal line from the extreme lows of the trend. A second mathematical support can be found using a large mathematical average of the previous price. I prefer the 200 period estimated moving average (EMA). Lastly, and perhaps the most important, drawing a fibonacci retracement from the high and low of the entire trend shows very obvious horizontal support and resistance zones. The 0.236 fibonacci level showing horizontal resistance of the 200+ day ascending triangle and horizontal support when the Bitfinex hack became public knowledge on August 2nd. The 0.5 fibonacci level showing horizontal resistance before a return to the previous ATH and showing horizontal support after the first of many People\u2019s Bank of China announcements.\nWith the diagonal trendline, 200EMA, and 0.618 fibonacci level showing a strong confluence of support at ~$690, I would expect this to be the return to mean zone should price fall much further to the 50% retracement level at $758. An example of this would be the rejection wick during the Bitfinex hack on August 2nd. Although price dipped far below the 200EMA, the close for the day occurred above the 200EMA. Unlike the Bitfinex hack, which occurred as a singular event and was over, a hard fork would represent ongoing uncertainty into uncharted territory. This would suggest an immediate return to mean may be less likely.\nFor the immediate term, on the one hour time frame, a few things are beginning to emerge:\n1.\u00a0Rising wedge with resistance confluence at 50% fibonacci retracement\n2. Volume consolidation and divergence\n3.\u00a0Relative strength index (RSI) support trendline\n\nA\u00a0rising wedge is often a reversal pattern which can certainly break upwards but more often than not represents bearish price action upon resolution \u2014 in this case, bearish continuation. The wedge gets tighter and tighter until a decision is made. Wedges like to break when \u00be full or greater, which brings the price to approximately $1100: a round even number representing psychological resistance which is also 50% of the most recent downward move.\nWe also notice a descending volume profile which can be read in one of two ways. Either price is consolidating for a greater move in general, or, this represents a bearish divergence showing a higher highs in price on lower volume, which would suggest weakening bullish momentum. \nLastly, the RSI is showing a support trendline with multiple touches. An hourly candle close with RSI below this trendline would suggest a breakdown in price as well. There is no divergence currently on RSI.\nSummary\n1. The possibility and likelihood of a hard fork creates a substantial opportunity for large bearish price action.\n2.\u00a0A basic trading plan for a large market event includes basic support and resistance zones of any given trend. In this case, a 50% retracement would bring price to ~$760 and a return to mean would bring price to ~$900.\n3. Watch for rising wedge resolution and a retest of the previous local low in the immediate term.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 20}

According to U.K.-based bitcoin trading firm Bittylicious, customers of Santander Bank received official letters of account termination almost immediately after utilizing their bank accounts to purchase or sell bitcoin.\nSince mid-2015, major banks and financial service providers in countries including the U.S. and Australia have singled out customers and businesses involved with bitcoin trading or operations. In September of 2015, Rod Sim, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, opened an investigation into the country\u2019s largest banks, such as the Commonwealth Bank, which were suspected of abruptly terminating user accounts without sending any prior notifications.\nAt the time, Queensland Nationals Senator Matthew Canavan wrote:\n\u201cThe actions by the banks would appear to directly engage competition in the financial services industry as it stands now \u2014 and, by effectively nipping in the bud the growth of potential competitors, is likely to substantially reduce the potential for future competition to the detriment of consumers in the future.\u201d\nThe unexpected closure of bank accounts of bitcoin users and businesses led to local digital currency businesses terminating their services. Businesses refused to provide bitcoin payment and trading services within Australia due to limited methods of facilitating fiat reserves.\nSimilar Case in the U.S.\u00a0\nA similar trend has emerged in Europe, as Santander Bank started to send official bank account termination notices to users suspected of using their accounts to trade in digital currencies such as bitcoin and ether.\nThe letter acquired by Bittylicious emphasized that the bank will not be able to provide any banking services to users and declined to provide explanations for their decision. Several users received identical bank account closure letters from Santander Bank business manager Victoria Wells, who wrote:\n\u201cWe want to let you know that we can\u2019t offer you banking facilities anymore. Under the terms and conditions of the account, we can withdraw banking facilities by giving you notice in writing and, in line with our company policy, we don\u2019t give further information about how we\u2019ve made our decision.\u201d\nSantander Bank\u2019s account-termination message was nearly identical to that of the Australian banks\u2019 letters in October of 2015. During that period, Bitcoin Magazine reported that the Commonwealth Bank, amongst other major Australian banks, refused to provide any additional explanation or clarification on why bitcoin business and user accounts have been terminated.\n\u201cOur members have said the banks have been remarkably unwilling to provide explanations for ceasing to provide services for ADCCA members. Our members, some of whom may end up being partners with or competitors to the banks in the future, are currently at the mercy of established financial institutions,\u201d the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association Chairman Ron Tucker told Bitcoin Magazine at the time.\nThe decision of Santander Bank to close the bank accounts of bitcoin users is more controversial now because of the clear legality of bitcoin in Europe and the U.S. Most bitcoin exchanges are well regulated and strictly compliant with both financial and money transmission regulations. Since exchanges can be suspended when operating without proper Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems, the regulatory aspect of bitcoin shouldn\u2019t be a factor when closing the accounts of bitcoin users.\nCurrently, major banks including Santander Bank are focusing on the development of their own digital currencies and unique financial infrastructure, utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s fundamental blockchain technology. It could be perceived, therefore, that Santander Bank is demonstrating a hostile behavior toward bitcoin users to protect their own interest in blockchain technology.\nIn fact, Santander Bank recently left the R3 consortium to focus on blockchain technology development after the consortium clarified that they will not need blockchain technology in order to provide essential infrastructure to the global financial industry. Santander is also extremely optimistic toward the future of blockchain technology, and according to the bank, the technology will cut operating costs of banks by up to $20 billion by 2022.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 17}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIf a Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork leads to a coin-split, major bitcoin exchanges will list coins on that branch as a new asset: BTU.\nEarlier this week, the world\u2019s largest mining pool, AntPool, announced it would switch all its hash power to Bitcoin Unlimited, a software implementation that is incompatible with the current Bitcoin protocol. With this move from an influential player in the Chinese mining ecosystem, a split in Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is starting to look more likely. If such a coin-split occurs, there could \u2014 for a while \u2014 be two types of \u201cbitcoin,\u201d which many worry could be confusing.\nA group of major exchanges, including Bitfinex, Kraken, Bitstamp, BTCC and others, therefore announced today that coins on the Bitcoin Unlimited branch will be considered a new asset. Coins on the branch that follows the current Bitcoin protocol will be listed under the original ticker.\n\u201c[I]f a contentious hardfork occurs, the Bitcoin Core implementation will continue to be listed as BTC (or XBT) and the new fork as BTU (or XBU),\u201d says the joint letter published today.\nCoin-split\nA hard fork is an incompatible protocol change. These can be risky, because if some Bitcoin users adopt the change, while others do not, the network, blockchain, and currency can split in two.\nThis is what happened to Ethereum last summer, which is why there is now also an \u201cEthereum Classic.\u201d There was relatively little contention over which of the two branches should be called \u201cEthereum\u201d at the time of the fork, in part because the Ethereum Foundation holds the \u201cEthereum\u201d trademark, and its founder, Vitalik Buterin, made a clear choice for the hard-forked chain.\nBut for Bitcoin, no one holds a trademark, and it seems unlikely Satoshi Nakamoto will ever return. (And even if he does return it\u2019s unclear how much authority Bitcoin users would attribute to him.) As such, a coin-split, which may occur if Bitcoin Unlimited hard forks and becomes incompatible with most other Bitcoin implementations, could be more confusing.\nTo avoid as much confusion as possible, and ensure that operations can continue, a group of some of the biggest bitcoin exchanges in the world is now committing to list the coins on the Bitcoin Unlimited branch as a new asset, should the situation arise.\n\u201cSince it appears likely we may see a hardfork initiated by the Bitcoin Unlimited project, we have decided to designate the Bitcoin Unlimited fork as BTU (or XBU),\u201d they state. \u201cThe Bitcoin Core implementation will continue to trade as BTC (or XBT) and all exchanges will process deposits and withdrawals in BTC even if the BTU chain has more hashing power.\u201d\nAmong others, the letter is signed by the biggest exchange in the world by trading volume, Bitfinex, the biggest euro exchange by trading volume, Kraken, and major Chinese exchange BTCC. Other signatories include major USD exchange Bitstamp, Mexico-based exchange Bitso, UK-based exchange Coinfloor, Dutch brokerage and exchange Bitonic/Bl3p, altcoin exchanges Bittrex and ShapeShift, decentralized exchange Bitsquare/bisq and several more.\nReplay Protection\nAdditionally, the exchanges request that the Bitcoin Unlimited team solves another problem before BTU is listed on the exchanges at all: replay attacks.\nWithout special precautions, a coin-split can be messy. When Ethereum split, for example, transactions on both sides of the fork looked exactly the same. As such, spending coins on one end of the chain could accidentally lead to the equivalent coin being spent on the other side of the chain. Instead of paying someone only ether (ETH), a user may unintentionally pay classic ether (ETC) as well \u2014 or vice versa.\nThe current implementation of Bitcoin Unlimited does not include replay protection. Therefore, if Bitcoin Unlimited hard forks and creates a coin-split, similar problems may emerge.\nAs such, the exchanges also ask the Bitcoin Unlimited team to include replay protection.\n\u201cNone of the undersigned can list BTU unless we can run both chains independently without incident. Consequently, we insist that the Bitcoin Unlimited community (or any other consensus breaking implementation) build in strong two-way replay protection. Failure to do so will impede our ability to preserve BTU for customers and will either delay or outright preclude the listing of BTU,\u201d they write.\nRead the complete letter with signatories here.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 17}

That\u2019s why we are pushing our Go-Mobile strategy. Today, everyone and everything is moving, that\u2019s why we can\u2019t have a network that is run by stationary objects.\u201d \nQtum makes this possible through a combination of features of the Ethereum and Bitcoin protocols. Existing smart contract platforms require clients to run a full node and hold a full blockchain copy to run DAPPs, an untenable prospect for smaller devices in a low bandwidth environment. Qtum gets around this requirement by stacking the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on top of Bitcoin\u2019s UTXO architecture, making EVM accessible with lite wallets and the SVP protocol. \nThis innovation allows users to interact with the Bitcoin network and validate their own transactions without having to download and sync with the entire blockchain.\n \n\u201cMaking smart contracts work on smartphones and tablets heralds a new age in the field of decentralized computation,\u201d said Dai. \u201cWith about half of all internet traffic being generated by mobile devices, every real-world use case for decentralized applications would massively benefit from mobile support \u2014 especially if we\u2019re taking the tendencies of developing markets into account.\u201d\nHighlighting Qtum\u2019s goal of being a protocol for commercial applications, Dai also noted that \u201cbringing the blockchain to mobile devices isn\u2019t just about consumers, it\u2019s one of the primary platforms for businesses.\u201d \nFollowing heavy community interest, Qtum decided to bring forward the release of a source code snapshot for public review, illustrating how the platform will work.\u00a0\nIn addition to bringing smart contract and DAPP functionality to mobile and connected devices, Qtum sees its platform as a way for smart contract technology to be utilized to control \u201cnon-smart\u201d hardware, bringing even legacy hardware and devices into a blockchain-secured IoT.\n\u201cRelying on existing Raspberry Pi\u2013like devices already present in most standard appliances, Qtum smart contracts can potentially control any device with an accessible API,\u201d said Jordan Earls, co-founder of the Qtum Project. \u201cThis way the interaction of \u2018things\u2019 in a given business could be programmed and orchestrated with very little investment in specialized hardware.\u201d\n \nWith smart city initiatives aiming to utilize blockchain technology to support connected infrastructure and automated services being announced in the last year for China by the Wanxiang Group and for Singapore by the Singaporean government, the environment may be right for Qtum to roll out the feature-rich protocol they have been building.\nThe Qtum Foundation, having engaged PwC for project management support, will conduct a crowdsale of its Qtum blockchain token starting on March 16. After the crowdsale, further testing of the Qtum blockchain will be conducted before the platform goes live.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 15}

It does not, however, have plans to incorporate digital currencies themselves into the platform just yet.\nOn March 13, BABB announced that it signed a deal with banking and payments solutions provider Contis Group Ltd. to use Contis\u2019s white-label banking license and banking services infrastructure for its upcoming mobile banking app. \nThe partnership will initially cover the integration of BABB\u2019s blockchain banking platform with Contis\u2019s banking services infrastructure and payment solutions, and provide BABB with a full U.K. banking license, which it requires to launch its mobile banking app to the U.K. market. \nPeter J. Cox, Executive Chairman of Contis Group Ltd., stated, \u201cWe are very excited to join forces with BABB to launch this revolutionary app that will bring financial inclusion to the masses. We see BABB\u2019s vision to create a banking platform that can open a bank account with just a selfie and voice as very powerful innovation.\u201d\nThe banking app is scheduled to launch later this year with basic banking, payments and peer-to-peer payment functions.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nSince most altcoins are based on Bitcoin\u2019s codebase, upgrades to Bitcoin are often relatively easy to implement in altcoins. Indeed, as Segregated Witness (SegWit) is slow to activate on Bitcoin, several altcoins are taking a stab at implementing and activating the soft fork first.\nHowever, it seems the very same politics that are holding back the protocol upgrade on Bitcoin are now seeping into several of these altcoins.\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is a stalling tactic from miners,\u201d Viacoin lead developer Romano told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThey know that if SegWit activates on altcoins, it will make blocking it on Bitcoin even less credible.\u201d\nGroestlcoin\nLaunched in 2014, Groestlcoin has a total market cap of some $365,000, earning it the 163th spot on CoinMarketCap at time of publication. This makes it the smallest of the five altcoins aiming for SegWit but also the first to have actually succeeded in activating it. The required 95 percent of hash power signaled support back in January, and the protocol upgrade has been live since.\n\u201cJackie,\u201d who prefers not to reveal his full name, is the project lead for Groestlcoin.\n\u201cAll the FUD [Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt] is false,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cSegWit as a soft fork is about as safe as the CSV soft fork was \u2014 and you don\u2019t hear anyone complain about that.\u201d\nAs a digital currency that isn\u2019t used much yet, Groestlcoin never faced scaling issues like Bitcoin. But Jackie said he considers SegWit a malleability fix first and foremost, which in turn enables features like the lightning network, atomic cross-chain transactions and other innovations.\n\u201cLess useful and elegant versions of lightning [network], TumbleBit and Mimblewimble were possible with the old version of Groestlcoin, but they are greatly enhanced now Segregated Witness is activated on the Groestlcoin network,\u201d Jackie noted.\nThat said, Segregated Witness itself is not very actively used so far. There are no Groestlcoin wallets that support the option, so apart from some specially crafted transactions to test that the new feature worked, most Groestlcoin transactions still use the old, pre-SegWit format.\nThough, Jackie added, \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of updating our Electrum version for Groestlcoin to support SegWit transactions. That should be done before the end of this year. When that is completed anyone should be able to easily send and receive SegWit transactions.\u201d\nVertcoin\nVertcoin may well be the next altcoin to activate Segregated Witness.\nAs a result of an implementation bug, Vertcoin initially suffered a setback from their Segregated Witness integration: the blockchain forked in two. Vertcoin developer and project manager \u201cetang600\u201d emphasized, however, that this had nothing to do with SegWit itself \u2014 only with how they implemented it.\nThe issue has since been resolved and SegWit signaling has started. Requiring 75 percent hash rate support, it is getting relatively close to activation with some 40 percent of hash rate signaling.\nHowever, one mystery miner, most likely a solo miner, controls over 30 percent of all hash rate. It\u2019s this miner that is seemingly holding everyone back.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who this miner is,\u201d etang600 told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe are trying to figure out ways to contact him. But it\u2019s still pretty early; we have only been signaling for two weeks, so we hope they\u2019ll update.\u201d\nLitecoin, SysCoin and Viacoin and the F2Pool Dilemma\nLitecoin ($200 million market cap for #6 spot on CoinMarketCap), SysCoin ($6.9 million market cap for #49 spot on CoinMarketCap) and Viacoin ($1.1 million market cap for #104 spot on CoinMarketCap) are also planning to implement Segregated Witness. \nBut since Viacoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, and SysCoin is merge-mined with Bitcoin, all three coins are facing the same problem: Bitcoin and Litecoin mining pool F2Pool is not signaling support for the soft fork. \nIn addition to benefits offered by a malleability fix, SysCoin will adopt Schnorr signatures: a signature scheme that could make both Bitcoin and SysCoin more efficient. Unsurprisingly, therefore, SysCoin backend developer Jagdeep Sidhu is hopeful F2Pool will start signaling support for the upgrade soon.\n\u201cF2Pool will probably signal support for Segregated Witness on Bitcoin and SysCoin together,\u201d Sidhu told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBut I think they\u2019re still in wait-and-see mode.\u201d\nWhen asked by Bitcoin Magazine last autumn, F2Pool operator Wang Chun said his system could not build C++11 and that\u2019s why he was holding off on SegWit signaling.\nToday, on Twitter, Chun suggested he may be able to finally compile C++11 code when Debian 9 is released.\n\n\nI\u2019ve heard rumors that Debian 9 will come with a C++11-compatible compiler. So let\u2019s prayer for it could be released sooner and sooner. https://t.co/uW0ob1x80H\u2014 Wang Chun (@f2pool_wangchun) March 20, 2017\n\n\n\nBut some are skeptical that an inability to compile C++11 is the real reason Chun isn\u2019t signaling support yet. For one, compiling C++11 should not be that difficult in the first place. And as Sidhu pointed out, the latest version of SysCoin is already coded in C++11. Since SysCoin recently hard forked, older versions of the software are no longer compatible, so any SysCoin miner must be able to compile C++11. That includes F2Pool.\nSegWit signaling will start soon on Viacoin, but Romano is not very optimistic about quick activation either. \u201cIt seems more likely they want to refrain from activating Segregated Witness on altcoins because that would give them even less reason to hold off activation on Bitcoin,\u201d he said.\nRomano went even further. \u201cMaybe F2Pool are under some hidden pressure or coercion, and are trying to make a plausible cover story. It is well known that Jihan Wu of Bitmain controls the supply of about 70 percent of the mining hardware. His mining pool is blocking SegWit on Bitcoin, and he is able to exert pressure on miners and pools by sanctioning new equipment sales should they go against his wishes.\u201d\nF2Pool operator Wang Chun told Bitcoin Magazine that he preferred not to comment at this time. But in response to Romano\u2019s comment, Bitmain\u2019s Jihan Wu said:\n\u201cThey are customers of us, and there is enough competition in the market. (Where is the other so-called \"30%\" coming from?) This theory is not right on the assumption part. Wang Chun of F2Pool is a very mature man, he gives no sh* to any authorities or political pressure.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 20}

The object here is to mitigate scenarios where customer and ad agency relationships become seriously compromised due to these issues.\nIn January, Ethereum-based blockchain technology firm adChain began a partnership with the decentralized application studio ConsenSys to create a key blockchain solution tailored for the online advertising industry.\nThe adChain protocol works across all digital advertising channels, enabling participants across the supply chain, from advertisers to demand-side platforms (DSP), publishers and safety vendors, to create a synchronized, fluid ecosystem free of fraud, bot traffic and malware. \nBuilt on the adChain protocol, MetaX develops blockchain-based protocols and decentralized applications that provide utility and value to the digital advertising industry, serving as the actual bridge to access the adChain protocol. \u00a0\nThe company, based in Los Angeles and founded by advertising industry veterans, allows the digital advertising supply chain process to flow in a trustworthy and secure way using blockchain technology. The MetaX platform is currently in operation with select private beta partners.\nFounding team members include ad tech veterans who\u2019ve been curating and developing, in collaboration with ConsenSys, this working concept for nearly two years. With today\u2019s announcement, they are now bringing it to market.\nTargeting the Advertising Industry\nThis joint effort targets the online advertising industry, which is primed for disruption, particularly with the rampant fraud and inefficiencies in the media supply chain. This move signifies another vertical where an Ethereum-based blockchain is ideally suited to make serious headway with the aforementioned ad-industry issues. \nSays Joseph Lubin, founder of ConsenSys: \u201cThe digital advertising industry is experiencing tremendous growth while increasingly struggling with problems like ad fraud, offering an ideal use case for blockchain technology. The MetaX team are experts in digital advertising. It was a perfect complement to work with us, the largest blockchain startup, in helping the industry solve these problems and become more efficient and transparent. The development of the adChain protocol on the Ethereum platform brings a powerful and unparalleled approach toward reaching these goals.\u201d \u00a0\nThe platform endeavors to resolve fraud and trust issues through the following:\n- End-to-end transparency where a trustworthy, holistic view of all data related to an impression is easily accessible\n- Campaign coordination and auditing that provides advertisers with a comprehensive audit trail for everything related to a campaign (e.g., participants, media and placements)\n- Fraud identification: Being able to identify and blacklist in real-time at a protocol level, routing out and neutralizing it before significant damage can take place\n- Real-time reconciliation and data collection so that advertisers and their vendors can see where other problems arise across the supply chain and take advantage of coordination efficiencies to help track/solve issues\n- Cryptographically secure event processing where through the use of the the MetaX platform, advertisers and publishers can execute massive transaction volume while maintaining integrity and security of their impression data\n- Comprehensive data that complements existing safety vendors and fraud prevention solutions by providing secure and comprehensive data\n- Ad-friendly tracking beacons and basic scripting that allow MetaX and the adChain protocol to seamlessly integrate with the industry\u2019s existing solutions, enabling interoperability and easy adoption by the digital advertising ecosystem\nToday\u2019s announcement comes as the digital advertising innovation age is in rapid acceleration mode, arguably at a pace beyond what standard industry protocols can support. This has led to vulnerabilities in the ad ecosystems, as well as deceptive practices. \nBlockchain Technology Is Right for Digital Advertising\n \nDigital advertising is a massive growth industry with global ad spending reaching $542.55 billion in 2016. Ad fraud is rampant, costing the industry over $7 billion a year. Analysts predict this figure could balloon up to $20 billion by 2020.\nIt\u2019s here where blockchain technology is seen as a viable solution. A blockchain can deliver a detailed audit trail through its immutable ledger \u2014 something that has high appeal in the advertising world. The end result is a highly scalable, trusted solution for tracking and verifying advertising impressions, allowing media buyers a 100-percent transparency window into the supply chain.\nJames Young, chief technology officer at MetaX, spoke highly of ConsenSys as a partner, noting its contributions to blockchain scalability and to permissioned privacy tailored to digital advertising. He called 2016 the year of the digital advertising \u201cmortgage crisis, citing the ongoing scenario of Methbot, which he says has defrauded the digital advertising industry anywhere from $3 million to $5 million a day, underscoring the importance of this collaboration. \nKen Brook, CEO of MetaX, believes the fusion between blockchain and ad tech is just at a beginning stage. He notes the recent announcement of NASDAQ\u2019s new blockchain-based exchange, known as the New York Interactive Ad Exchange (NYIAX), as key to their push toward more transparent and secure media transactions. Brook also believes we will see data management platforms that utilize blockchain technology emerge, possibly allowing the retargeting/tracking services that offer some form of a blockchain ID rather than the inefficient cookie. \u00a0\nConcludes Brook: \u201cGiven the amount of hype around blockchain [technology], I imagine we are going to see several key storylines emerge this year in the digital ad space.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 21}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nNearly every block of transactions on the Bitcoin network has been full for the past couple of weeks, and miners are reaping the benefits of users having to bid for the right to have their transactions confirmed on the blockchain in a timely manner.\nAlthough Bitcoin was often promoted due to its extremely low transaction fees of a couple of pennies or less, the one-megabyte hard cap on the number of transactions that can be processed by the network has forced users to pay $0.50 or more per transaction in recent weeks.\nBecause users are willing to bid against each other for block space, bitcoin-denominated miner transaction fee revenue has increased fivefold over the past year. However, it\u2019s also unclear what effect congestion has on the market price of bitcoin, which directly impacts the value of the miners\u2019 block reward.\nFinding a direct connection between network congestion and price is not a straightforward task, so it\u2019s not entirely clear whether miners are profiting directly from the lack of Segregated Witness (SegWit) activation or a hard-forking increase in the block size limit. In general, the bitcoin price is also up around 300 percent since this time last year.\nThe Numbers Behind Transaction Fees\nAccording to BitInfoCharts, Bitcoin miners were taking in 10 to 15 bitcoins per day from transaction fees for all of 2014 and half of 2015. An increase in fees started around the time Bitcoin\u2019s scaling debate spilled out of the technical forums and into the media in the summer of 2015. Bitcoin miners were collecting around 30 bitcoins per day in fees by the end of 2015 \u2014 a doubling of the previous norm.\nKeep in mind, these transaction fees are collected in addition to the block subsidy, which was halved from 25 bitcoins per block to 12.5 bitcoins per block in the summer of 2016. The block reward is the combination of the block subsidy and the transaction fees.\n\nFees really started to take off in the summer of 2016, when the fees collected by miners per day amounted to 50 to 60 bitcoins. Since then, miner transaction fee revenue has seen meteoric growth to 250 bitcoins per day. As the chart provided by Blockchair.com shows, this is due to the fact that demand for block space has increased.\nMiners now collect 1,800 bitcoins per day via the block subsidy and 250 bitcoins per day via transaction fees. This means the total reward is roughly 2,050 bitcoins, of which roughly 12 percent is made up of transaction fees.\nAnother way of looking at this is that 12 percent of the bitcoin-denominated miner revenue lost due to last summer\u2019s block reward halving has been brought back via transaction fees. Of course, in U.S. dollar terms, bitcoin\u2019s rise in price has more than made up for the revenue lost from the block reward halving.\nScaling Debate Not Affecting Bitcoin Miners\nMany Bitcoin hashers \u2014 the miners that provide their hash power to mining pools \u2014 were initially missing out on the increased transaction fee revenue. This was because mining pools were not sharing the transaction fees with their hashers. Since transaction fees are now around 12 percent of the overall block reward, competition has forced mining pools to share this transaction fee revenue with hashers.\nMany mining pools, even those that routinely complain about the lack of a hard-forking increase to the block size limit, are now pushing marketing campaigns built around this new, growing source of revenue for hashers.\nWhile some users are complaining about higher fees or the fact that they are unable to get a transaction confirmed in a timely manner, miners are earning increased revenue. Although fees have risen quite dramatically from where they were a year or two ago, it\u2019s unclear how much effect this has on the digital gold use case, which some believe provides the largest amount of support for the bitcoin price \u2014 and therefore keeps miners happy, too.\nThe Future of Bitcoin Transaction Fees\nWhat will happen with transaction fees over the near term remains unclear.\nIf adopted, Segregated Witness may offer some relief in terms of an effective doubling of the availability of block space. But some argue that cheaper fees would not last that long due to the possibility of blocks quickly becoming full again (at least partially due to the cheaper fees that come with excess block space) and demand for block space continuing to rise.\nThe same line of thinking applies to a possible hard-forking increase to the block size limit by way of Bitcoin Unlimited or the newly promoted ideas behind BitcoinEC, although it\u2019s less clear if these these particular proposals have the support of the Bitcoin economy.\nRecently, China-based Bitcoin miner Chandler Guo indicated that no one wants to rock the boat while the bitcoin price is still at historical highs. It\u2019s possible that changes in the supply of block space may not be made until stakeholders\u2019 pockets start hurting.\nCivic CEO and Gyft Co-Founder Vinny Lingham shared similar thoughts on the most recent episode of This Week in Bitcoin. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a weird situation because the current high price is really increasing the fees, but that\u2019s also stopping SegWit because you basically have a situation where the miners are making so much in fees that they don\u2019t want to put SegWit in because it will take away their fees,\u201d said Lingham. \u201cNow, if the price was at $200, SegWit would be a no-brainer because they wouldn\u2019t be making any money in fees anyway.\u201d\nThe demand for block space may change if layer-two solutions, such as the lightning network and TumbleBit, rise in popularity. Additionally, miners may eventually have more avenues for earning transaction fees through the use of sidechains.\nThe economics behind changes in the supply of block space require further evaluation. While more block space should lead to lower transaction fees (all things being equal), the specific points at which changes in the supply of block space lead to higher or lower U.S.-dollar-denominated revenues for miners remain unclear.\nFeatured image via Blockchair.com.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 22}

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nAltcoins like Ethereum are often thought as experiment labs for the possibilities of what changes could eventually be brought to Bitcoin. These changes are often done through a hard fork, a non-backward-compatible upgrade that separates a digital currency into two chains, one with the changes and one without. Miners and users decide which is more relevant, simply by using whichever chain they prefer. One chain thrives and the other dies due to lack of network support. Altcoins have also had relatively smaller market capitalization compared to Bitcoin, which means there are fewer consequences for big, risky changes or endeavors.\nFor traders or investors, this uneasy footing is certainly something to avoid on the short-term, but those with a healthy appetite for risk may look for these opportunities. \nThis week, Ethereum (ETH) hit an all-time high (ATH) in USD terms as well as in total market capitalization, ETH/BTC ratio and ETH/USD price. To understand how ETH got here, let\u2019s take a quick look back at the events that took place in 2016. I\u2019ve added a 200-day estimated moving average (EMA) to the chart, which is the fool-proof gold standard for trend determination. Price above the 200 EMA suggests bullish sentiment, and price below suggests bearish sentiment. \n02/29/16 \u2014 Second hard fork to allow for further protocol changes\n03/13/16 \u2014 Technical three drives into ETH/BTC ATH completes\n04/26/16 \u2014 50 percent pullback\n04/30/16 \u2014 Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) begins\n06/12/16 \u2014 DAO hacked\n07/20/16 \u2014 Third hard fork to reverse DAO hack\n10/11/16 \u2014 Price falls below 200 EMA\n11/22/16 \u2014 Fourth hard fork to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks\n03/01/17 \u2014 Price breaks 200 EMA\n03/16/17 \u2014 ETH/BTC makes a new ATH\n\n\nAfter ETH/USD broke the $2 mark in early February 2016, technicals drove price to an ATH with a three-drive pattern.\nAs Bitcoin was making a new ATH in March 2017, ETH followed suit as well after breaking the technical resistance of the 200 EMA. Between the creation of the DAO and several hard forks, it\u2019s likely that many investors stayed out of the coin based on the fear, uncertainty and doubt that multiple hard forks and ongoing DoS attacks bring to a digital currency in its nascent stages. Hard forks, from a trader\u2019s perspective, mean two things:\n1. Events have occurred requiring drastic changes to the network;\n2. Changes can be untested and messy after the hard fork occurs.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean catastrophe will strike, but the mere possibility opens the door for unintended consequences, which isn\u2019t exactly inviting when risking thousands of dollars trading an asset. I mention all of this because only after a period of stability was ETH able to continue its bull run to the current levels. \n\nBased on the market memory principle, ETH/BTC was able to find horizontal support from the previous three drives in early 2016. With the addition of a fiat on-ramp through Coinbase on July 21, 2016, it was perhaps inevitable that, given the chance during a period of network stability and an influx of new users, the ETH/BTC ratio would again break the 200 EMA.\nThe obvious questions now are:\n- Is ETH stable at these prices?\n- Will ETH continue making ATHs?\n- Will ETH pull back?\n- Is this an ETH bubble?\nLet\u2019s try to answer those questions by adding a pitchfork for diagonal support and resistance, which is drawn from extreme highs and lows of a trend, and pivots, which are mathematical support and resistance levels based on previous price.\n\nPrice is currently sitting at the first expected diagonal resistance of the pitchfork, and very near the yearly R2 pivot. This confluence of resistance is confirmed by the pullback currently in the price. This is a large, young pitchfork. Should it continue, the median line (red) becomes a high-probability target for price. A feasible trajectory (blue) with a pullback to the R1 pivot, or previous ATH, a touch of the pitchfork resistance diagonal and then a reach for the median line is certainly not out of the question.\nThe 1.272 and 1.618 Fibonacci extensions also give further support and resistance possibilities. \u00a0\n\nZooming in to the four-hour time frame, it\u2019s possible that price has set up another three-drive pattern, albeit not perfect, similar to the pattern that led to a then-ATH on March 31, 2016, followed by a 50-percent pullback, yielding a target on ~0.303 ETH/BTC. \n\nSummary\n1. After establishing an ATH in 2016 following a three-drive pattern, ETH had a tumultuous year fraught with hard forks, an experiment gone wrong (The DAO) and DoS attacks on the network.\n2.\u00a0Following months of stability and a Bitcoin ATH, ETH was able to break the all-important 200 EMA, creating a technical opportunity for a bullish run.\n3.

According to Pierce, Blockchain Capital is \u201cproviding the investor base across the globe with the opportunity to invest into a leading venture fund via a liquid, tradable, digital token.\u201d\nTraditionally, venture fund investment has been restricted to an elite class of investors, including wealthy university endowments and politically connected unions and pension funds. These typical venture fund investments are also highly illiquid, locking up funds for terms as long as 10 years.\nDuring the initial token offering period, average investors who want to diversify and get exposure to the surging growth in blockchain startups can purchase BCAP tokens representing digital interests in the Blockchain Capital III VC fund, using bitcoin, ether or U.S. dollars. \nUnlike traditional VC fund investments with their 10-year terms, liquidity barriers are overcome since these tokens will soon be able to be bought and sold on secondary markets via established digital currency exchanges. Those exchange partnerships have yet to be announced but are in the works.\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, managing partner Bart Stephens explained that BCAP tokens follow the SEC exemptions for unregulated securities \u2014 the same structure as bonds and high-yield debt \u2014 under Regulation D, allowing them to be sold in the U.S., as well as Regulation S, allowing them to be sold internationally.\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing within existing guidleines,\u201d said Stephens, \u201cbut offering something new.\u201d\nWalking the Blockchain Walk\nLaunched in 2013, Blockchain Capital\u2019s initial fund was the first venture capital fund dedicated to the Bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem. It was also the first fund to accept capital calls in bitcoin. \nThe Argon Group, which is collaborating with Blockchain Capital on this initiative, is a major player in the emerging digital currency and token-based capital markets. \n\u201cWe are pioneering a groundbreaking moment in the history of venture capital by using blockchain technology to provide never-before-seen liquidity and access to investors,\u201d said Stan Miroshnik, CEO of The Argon Group, to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBy investing in venture capital through a digital token, investors get liquidity, transparency, clear view on value and an ability to participate in an asset class previously reserved for elite institutions.\u201d\nBlockchain Capital\u2019s current portfolio is comprised of 43 unique companies from its prior two funds. These include Bitfury, BitGo, BitPesa, BlockCypher, Blockstream, Chain, Coinbase, Gem, GoCoin, itBit, PeerNova, Ripple, Wave and Xapo, among other blockchain technology leaders. \nThis investment focus of the new fund is expected to further Blockchain Capital\u2019s established reputation of identifying outstanding blockchain technology companies led by ambitious management teams and partnering with them to accelerate growth. \n\u201cI\u2019ve never been more excited in my whole career,\u201d said Stephens, an experienced fintech exective, hedge fund manager and venture capitalist. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a great thing for the overall ecosystem. We think it\u2019s a great thing for the hobby industry of venture capital. Venture capitalists like to talk about disruption and innovation but very few of them walk the walk. We are actually using blockchain technology to disrupt ourselves. It\u2019s always a little uncomfortable but I\u2019ve always said if we don\u2019t do it someone else will.\u201d\nFull details of the offering will be disclosed in the offering memorandum, which is expected to be published on April 3, 2017, via vctoken.com.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 21}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nBitPay co-founders Stephen Pair and Tony Gallippi have been around Bitcoin for about as long as anyone else in the industry. The company was founded in 2011, and their actions generally indicate the future direction of the industry.\n\u201cWhen we started in 2011, we would be excited to get five or six transactions through BitPay in a day.\u201d said Pair in a fireside chat with Gallippi, held during the recent Distributed: Markets 2017 conference in Atlanta. \nBitPay would go on to cut deals with the likes of Microsoft, Newegg, Expedia and other major corporate customers to provide payment processing services.\nChallenges for Bitcoin\u2019s Use in Consumer Payments\nWhile many early Bitcoin adopters claimed the P2P digital cash system was going to replace the use of credit cards and completely overthrow the banking system in 2013, things haven\u2019t exactly panned out that way \u2014 at least not yet.\nBitcoin is currently dealing with some issues as a consumer payments platform, mainly because the system is experiencing growth at a rate faster than it can safely scale. \n\u201cWe have seen an increase in customer service inquiries because of transaction confirmation delays for bitcoin purchasers,\u201d Pair told Bitcoin Magazine in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing substantially higher transaction fees on our own settlement transactions.\u201d\nRecently, BitPay decided to stop covering Bitcoin network fees on invoice payments.\n\u201cThis friction is making us get more creative in how we do user experience design for delayed payment states on the BitPay platform,\u201d said Pair. \u201cOften delays are an educational opportunity to explain how the Bitcoin network works and point people to wallets that use dynamic transaction fees. Copay and BitPay wallet users have been largely immune from transaction delays because their wallets calculate transaction fees dynamically.\n\u201cOur designers and engineers are constantly attuned to how we can make using Bitcoin intuitive,\u201d Pair added.\nThe lightning network is a proposed method of dealing with the issues related to transaction delays and higher transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. The transaction caching layer would effectively enable potentially improved versions of many of the features people have associated with Bitcoin in the past, such as instant transactions at nearly no cost.\n\u201cWe\u2019re exploring all possible solutions for scalability,\u201d Pair said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise to us that Bitcoin needs to scale \u2014 scalability is something we\u2019ve been thinking about for years. The only surprise is that while we anticipated short-term bumps in the throughput, we thought that changes for more on-chain throughput would have happened a couple of years ago. This slow movement to increase network throughput is something we did not foresee. At some point we\u2019re going to reach an actual scalability limit that will only be overcome through solutions like these.\u201d\nSome have wondered whether companies like BitPay may turn away from Bitcoin and toward alternative options, such as altcoins or permissioned blockchains, due to the historically high U.S.-dollar-denominated fees and general congestion on the network. \n\u201cWe have carefully studied the most significant alternatives to the Bitcoin blockchain and have concluded that none of them are compelling,\u201d Pair responded.\nBitcoin\u2019s Use in Consumer Payments Is Still Growing\nAlthough Pair admitted Bitcoin has some issues with scaling right now, BitPay is still seeing growth in the use of the technology among consumers.\n\u201cBitcoin is the fastest, most secure and most cost-effective means of doing value transfer on the internet,\u201d said Pair. \u201cWe think of ourselves as a payment innovator, and from a functional perspective, consumer payments and B2B payments are no different on the Bitcoin network and on BitPay\u2019s platform.\u201d\nAt the Distributed: Markets fireside chat, Gallippi claimed that their transaction count has more than doubled over the past year. Much of that growth, he said, has been seen in the areas of digital goods and video games. Specifically, he pointed to digital distribution platform Steam\u2019s acceptance of bitcoin through BitPay as a source of this growth, and pointed out that there is a lot of overlap between the Bitcoin and gamer communities;\nGrowth for Bitcoin Outside of Consumer Payments\nIn addition to continued growth in the area of consumer payments, Pair noted that BitPay is also seeing growth in the use of Bitcoin for B2B money transfers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing significant interest and transaction volume growth from businesses that need to transfer value to other businesses,\u201d said Pair. \u201cBitcoin is a fantastic solution for these business-to-business transfers, especially when it comes to international payments, where bank transfers are still slow and inefficient.\n\u201cThey\u2019re using our platform for billing and settling internationally with a lot of their suppliers,\u201d Pair stated during the fireside chat.\nGallippi added that there has been an uptick in the use of Bitcoin for payment disbursements.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy to pay people on a regular basis to the majority of the world. Eastern Europe, Israel, Africa, India [and] the Middle East \u2014 where a lot of these apps are being [developed] \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to pay them,\u201d said Gallippi, as he explained how app stores pay developers who sell apps on their store.\nGallippi noted that for the app store example or digital marketing companies, BitPay can receive one payment from the business and then disburse payments in bitcoin at all of the endpoints.\n\u201cWe built that product originally because we had our own needs to pay our own employees in bitcoin,\u201d added Pair. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of Fortune 500 companies coming to us now every day asking us to solve these kinds of payments problems.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 22}
{"title": "A Bitcoin Beginner\u2019s Guide to Surviving a Coin-Split", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/beginners-guide-surviving-coin-split/", "birthday": "Mar 22, 2017  5:44 PM EST", "date": "2017-03-22 22:44:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThere is a chance Bitcoin will experience a coin-split soon. If a majority of miners (by hash power) switch to Bitcoin Unlimited and decide to mine blocks bigger than one megabyte, while at least some users stick to the current Bitcoin protocol, the network and blockchain can split in two. In that case, there may be two different types of Bitcoin tokens: \u201cBTC,\u201d which follows the current Bitcoin protocol, and \u201cBTU,\u201d which follows the new Bitcoin Unlimited protocol.\nThe good news is that each bitcoin would effectively be copied onto the Bitcoin Unlimited chain. If you hold bitcoin right now, you will hold both BTC and BTU after a split.\nThe bad news is that a coin-split can be messy and risky. This is mainly because, at first, all BTCs and all BTUs will be stuck together. You will need to separate them somehow; otherwise you can lose your BTC or your BTU.\nThis guide will provide you with the basics to stay safe during a coin-split, and make sure you make it to the \u201cother side\u201d with both your BTC and BTU intact.\nAuthor\u2019s note: If you want to play the BTC/BTU markets as soon as possible and you are fine with taking risks, and/or you really know what you are doing, this article is probably not for you. (Perhaps try this Electrum article instead.)\nIf you mostly just want to make sure not to lose your BTC or BTU, read on \u2026\nBefore the Coin-Split (That\u2019s Now)\nFirst of all, be aware that a coin-split is a high-risk situation. There is a real chance a sort of cyber-battle will break out between the two camps, perhaps even escalating to the point where bitcoin\u2019s exchange rate(s) drops sharply, possibly to zero. Make absolutely sure you are not holding more value in bitcoin than what you are willing to lose.\nIf you do decide to hold on to your bitcoins, the single most important piece of advice is this: control your own private keys.\nIf you are storing your bitcoins on an exchange, in a custodial wallet like Coinbase, Circle or Xapo, or on any other service that holds your private keys for you, you may or may not eventually receive coins on both ends of the chain. Several exchanges have so far suggested you may but have made no guarantees. And at least one exchange, GDAX, has explicitly indicated you may not.\nIf you\u2019re using any of these kinds of services to store your bitcoins, you need to create your own wallet. Send your bitcoins to this new wallet; this wallet now holds your private keys.\nWhat kind of wallet you want to use is up to you. That said, here are some basic solutions:\nIf you don\u2019t care about transacting with either BTC or BTU anytime soon, and really just want to keep both as a long-term investment, printing your private keys on a paper wallet is one option. This option, however, is only really secure if you follow strict security precautions, which you can find here.\nAnother option is to get a hardware wallet. Any of the hardware wallets listed on bitcoin.org will keep your private keys secure. One hardware wallet provider in particular, Trezor, has explicitly acknowledged that users will have access to their coins on both ends of the chain if a coin-split happens.\nRegular wallets are about as secure as your computer (or phone) is. Since most computers and phones are not all that secure, these are not ideal for large amounts. With that in mind, all mobile wallets and desktop wallets listed on bitcoin.org will store your private keys for you. Additionally, a full node like Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots gives you a little extra security during a coin-split, as you\u2019ll see below.\nIn any case: Make sure you make backups of your keys! Most wallets require you to do this when installing; don\u2019t skip this step.\nDuring the Coin-Split\nThe first thing to note is that Bitcoin Unlimited has not set a \"flag date\" to fork. This means that theoretically, a fork could happen at any time. Realistically, however, it will depend on miner coordination, and it will probably be obvious to even casual Bitcoin observers when a fork is close to happening.\nIf Bitcoin Unlimited does fork, things could get messy for anywhere between a couple of hours to a couple of days, or longer.\nUnfortunately, Bitcoin Unlimited currently does not include \u201creplay protection.\u201d This means that post-fork, transactions on both sides of the fork will look identical. If a transaction is picked up by both networks \u2014 for example, because the receiver of a transaction re-transmits the transaction on the other network \u2014 that transaction may be valid on both chains. This is called a \u201creplay attack.\u201d\nAs such, spending coins on one end of the chain could make you accidentally spend the equivalent coin on the other side of the chain. Instead of paying someone only BTC, you may unintentionally send BTU as well \u2014 or vice versa. This is how the BTCs and BTUs are \u201cstuck together.\u201d\nThe best way to prevent replay attacks is simple: do not send any transactions. Not until it is clearer to everyone what the post-fork situation looks like.\nIf you use Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots as a wallet and you want to accept BTC, that should still be fine. (Someone who didn\u2019t read this article may accidentally send you the equivalent in BTU, though. If this happens, you should probably return the funds later on.)\nBitcoin Unlimited, on the other hand, does not include \u201cwipeout protection.\u201d If the amount of mining power on the BTC chain ever overtakes the BTU chain, the entire BTU chain will be discarded (unless users on the BTU chain coordinate fast enough to prevent this in unconventional ways).\nUnless and until it is absolutely clear that Bitcoin Unlimited emerges as a definitive winner forever, accepting any BTU is very risky, and you probably shouldn\u2019t do it at all.\nAfter the Coin-Split\nIf both chains survive, and you control your private keys, you will have coins on both sides of the fork. But as mentioned, it will be tricky to spend coins on one chain without accidentally spending the equivalent on the other side.\nFortunately, there are ways to avoid these replay attacks. The most straightforward solution requires brand-new coins, mined after the split. These new coins are the only coins that do not exist on both chains and cannot, therefore, be spent on both. Combining these new coins with old coins effectively splits the BTC from BTU.\nThis coin-splitting can, and probably will, be a bit complex. But some exchanges will likely set up coin-splitting services and take care of most of the complexity behind the screens. You\u2019d just need to send your bitcoins to an exchange, and the exchange will credit your account with BTC and BTU. (They should even replay the transaction for you, to make sure they indeed receive both your coins and can split them for you.) If you want, you can now also sell your BTU for BTC (or fiat currency), or the other way round.\nThere may also be other solutions to split your coins in the event of a coin-split, perhaps even trustless solutions. But that remains to be seen.\nAfter the split, there will probably be wallets for both coins soon enough. Of course, you may need to upgrade your existing wallet or download a new wallet if and when this happens. This also remains to be seen. (Do not accept any transactions on your wallet before this is clear.)\nFurther specifics on what to do after a coin-split will be announced on Bitcoin Magazine (and most likely on bitcoin.org and other sources of information) if and when a coin-split occurs and we have a better understanding of the post-fork situation.Oh, and when you, years from now, want to use the funds stored on your paper wallet, don\u2019t forget you now own both BTC and BTU! (Wallets like Electrum and Blockchain allow you to upload the private keys, and you\u2019ll probably need to go through the same splitting ceremony.)\nIf only one chain survives, operations should continue at some point. However, it\u2019s not exactly clear what this post-fork landscape will look like. Perhaps you\u2019ll have to upgrade your wallet. This will also be announced on Bitcoin Magazine if and when it comes to it.\nIf neither chain survives, the Bitcoin experiment has failed, and your private keys will probably be worthless.\nSo, to Recap ...\n1. Control your private keys.\n2. To be on the safe side, avoid any transactions shortly after the split. (If you must accept BTC, use Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Knots as a wallet.)\n3. As the dust settles, split your coins. (How, exactly, will depend on Bitcoin\u2019s post-fork landscape.)\nThis article will be updated as the news develops.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 22}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nOne of the key narratives around Bitcoin has always been that it is a math-based, apolitical currency. In other words, the digital cash system was set up in a way that prevents political entities from altering the rules of the network. \u201cThe nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime,\u201d Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto once put it.\nHaving said that, the possibility of making changes to the Bitcoin protocol is a possible vector for political attacks. With enough support from the Bitcoin-using public, a fork could spell trouble for those who wish to continue playing by the original rules of Bitcoin, such as the costs associated with operating a full node (and thus limiting third-party trust at the base layer) or the digital currency\u2019s monetary policy.\nBitcoin miners signaling support for specific protocol changes is sometimes mistaken for a vote on the rules of Bitcoin, but it\u2019s unclear if there is much of a connection between what miners want and how speculators will react once they are able to trade two different digital currencies based off the distribution of bitcoins at a specific block height.\nPolitical Mining Pools\nIn the context of the current scaling debate, a few mining pools in particular have been extremely adamant in their support for specific visions of how the the protocol should evolve in the future. ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com\u2019s support for Bitcoin Unlimited has been the most obvious example of this phenomenon.\nThe idea is that miners who wish to see a hard-forking increase to bitcoin\u2019s block size limit (by way of Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s concept of emergent consensus) implemented into Bitcoin can point their hashrate at these particular mining pools. Supporters of this sort of philosophy have argued that 60 percent of the overall network hashrate may be all that is needed to activate this kind of change in Bitcoin.\nBut Miners Don\u2019t Control Bitcoin\nThe main issue with the concept of mining pools choosing to promote a specific vision for Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules is that these actions have no bearing on what will happen once a new, forked version of Bitcoin is available to trade against the original version of Bitcoin. While miners can indicate their support for a specific proposal, it\u2019s the users who will decide whether a successful hard fork has happened, an altcoin has been created or the new version of Bitcoin has any support at all.\nOn top of that, it is oftentimes difficult to tell the difference between a hard fork and an altcoin at first glance.\nMiners are in the business of Bitcoin to earn block rewards, including transaction fees. When a hard-forking change to Bitcoin is attempted, the end result is two digital currency networks by default (the original network without the rule changes and the new network with the proposed upgrades).\nInstead of enforcing rules on users, miners should respond to profit incentives. If a hard fork is activated and users remain on the original chain (thus assigning more value to the block rewards on that chain), miners will follow the more lucrative block reward and stick with the original chain as well \u2014 or waste money.\nTechnically, miners could decide to act against their own interests and mine the less profitable chain. They could even attempt to force their proposed rule changes on users by attacking the original chain. But from the perspective of users, this would not be much different from any nefarious actor taking control of a large amount of hashpower and attacking the network (usually referred to as a 51% attack). In such a scenario, users can deploy a hard fork to change Bitcoin\u2019s proof-of-work algorithm, which would effectively make the miners\u2019 expensive ASIC mining hardware worthless.\nIn short, the signaling of support for specific protocol changes or political views by mining pools may be useful as nothing more than a marketing tactic. Those who wish to see hard-forking changes implemented in Bitcoin need to talk with Bitcoin users, not miners.\nAre There Better Options for Gauging Support for Changes to Bitcoin?\nMaking any contentious change to Bitcoin via a hard fork or soft fork is difficult, but not impossible. Many soft-forking changes have been made to Bitcoin in the past, but an intentional hard fork for the purpose of changing the rules of the network has arguably never been executed.\nThe difficult aspect of the hard fork as compared to a soft fork is that everyone has to update their software for it to work. With a soft fork, it is said that changes can be implemented on an opt-in basis because they are backward compatible. However, some dispute this declaration as soft forks have the potential to lower the security of nodes that do not upgrade. Blockstream Co-Founder Pieter Wuille disputes this claim.\nGauging support for a hard fork is a difficult task. The developers behind Ethereum thought the hard fork to bail out DAO token holders would be such a no-brainer that they recommended exchanges not to worry about securing coins on the old chain. This led to the loss of vast amounts of customer funds on exchanges, such as BTC-e, once it became clear that the old chain still had support from a segment of the overall Ethereum community.\nThe lack of useful tools for estimating support for hard forks is one of the reasons soft forks are preferred by the current crop of Bitcoin Core contributors. Soft forks as implemented via BIP 9 can motivate users to react with their own hard fork, but the split chain is not the default (as it is with hard forks).\nAt this point, there are coin-voting mechanisms such\u00a0as Bitcoinocracy\u00a0and HODL.voting that show potential, but it\u2019s unclear if either of these options will lead to completely correct predictions. Coin-voting mechanisms were also used as the basis for the false prediction that the Ethereum hard fork related to the DAO would not result in two chains.\n\nIn the past, prediction markets and futures contracts have also been proposed as a method of gauging support for a change to Bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules.\nRight now, the best way to gauge support for a hard-forking change to Bitcoin, such as an increase to the block size limit via Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s model of emergent consensus, may be to execute the fork and see how the market responds.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 23}

Carlson is now the CEO of Giga Watt, a blockchain hosting and servicing center for mining hardware.\nCarlson\u2019s previous bitcoin mining firm, MegaBigPower, was recently acquired by Giga Watt, which Carlson says will essentially take everything MegaBigPower was working on and supercharge it with more capital and a bigger team.\nBitcoin Magazine recently reached out to Carlson in order to get his thoughts on everything from the incentives that persuade miners\u2019 actions on the Bitcoin network to the perceived centralization of bitcoin mining in China.\n\nHow much of Bitcoin\u2019s network hashrate is at your facility? Do you have a notable share of other coins\u2019 hashrate there?\nAt 3.5 Exahash, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of hashing on Bitcoin\u2019s network. If we use all our current available power, we\u2019d achieve only 1 percent.\nI\u2019ve been focusing on diversification in the last year. We now split our available power across about four or five primary blockchains and operate over 1,700 GPUs. That will change as we build out our 30 MW project this year, which will put up a lot of Bitcoin hashrate.\nWhat do you think the role of miners is in the Bitcoin network? Should they be implementing the protocol changes they think would be best for Bitcoin or looking to users, full node and the economy for guidance?\nIf you look at the way Bitcoin\u2019s protocol incentivizes miners, it\u2019s clear that the role of miners is to be focused on deploying as much processing equipment as they can, while focusing on improving the efficiency of the hardware, the facilities and the operations team.\nMiners don\u2019t get incentives to weigh in on political or technical debate. Miners will always seek the best returns. The system is designed this way.\nIt\u2019s more about self-preservation [than] it is about greed. Miners are the ones with the fixed costs they have to cover if they want to continue to operate. For example, as a miner I want to see fees rise. If my perception is that small blocks increase competition for transactions and drive fees higher, then the easiest thing for me to do is make no change at all.\nIf you look at who has the real power to change Bitcoin, it\u2019s the pools. But many of the pools keep transaction fees, so they also benefit from no change. The only people who are worried about it are those who have a deep enough understanding of the protocol to believe that Bitcoin may fail to grow without a change.\nThe answer (and solution) to all this is to look to the community of creative problem solvers for some innovation. If Bitcoin is not scaling in the direction of transactions per second, it will find scale in a different direction, likely as a result of innovation. \u00a0\nAre you still planning an ICO for Giga Watt? If so, will this be a registered security?\nWe\u2019ve been working very hard to come up with a product or service that gives anyone \u2014 not just accredited investors \u2014 access to our blockchain processing facility infrastructure. We didn\u2019t need to do an SEC-registered ICO. Instead, we created a token offering in which people can get access to the electrical infrastructure that powers their miners.\nWhen people place miners with us and own the WaTT tokens for the infrastructure that runs it, they are literally operating their mines with full economic advantage. We are giving people a way to remotely assemble their own mining operation within our facilities, where we have the best design, best team and most advantageous prices. We\u2019ve shown that the best results in mining are achieved by combining highly efficient facilities with extremely cheap electricity cost and now we are giving anyone in the world the opportunity to do it too.\nCan you respond to this blog post on the Bitmain website regarding the alleged unauthorized use of their trademark? They claim the following:\n\u201cWe have never authorized and will not authorize Giga Watt as our official hosting facility or our service center in the USA. We have never supported and will not support Giga Watt\u2019s ICO. We have never authorized and will not authorize Giga Watt to use our BITMAIN trademark in any circumstances. Mr. WU Jihan has never been and will not be a member of Giga Watt team.\u201d\nAs always, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. When the lawyers drop a bomb like this, it\u2019s often a \u201cshoot first, ask questions later\u201d type response. This was a combination of simple misunderstanding, timing and circumstance. Regrettable.\nNote: Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitmain, but the bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer had nothing to share outside what was already written in the blog post.\nDo you think there is a need to get more bitcoin mining happening outside of China? Is Washington the best alternative to China for mining?\nI absolutely do believe China has gotten too dominant on the network. Because of the economics of mining, it\u2019s simply not possible to create [the incentives] to mine just anywhere \u2014 in most places, the cost of power immediately rules out mining profitably.\nWe are fortunate to enjoy extremely cheap hydro power in Washington State, so it\u2019s one of a number of great places. As awareness of the blockchain processing industry begins to awaken, I\u2019m very interested to see how larger businesses (such as power generation owners) begin to find unique ways that blockchain processing can benefit them, thereby beginning a trend toward global decentralization again.\nDo you think miners should be signaling for Segregated Witness (SegWit) with nearly all exchanges and wallets preparing for it or looking forward to it?\nSegWit seems to have the most fundamentals behind it. It\u2019s a non-arbitrary solution, unlike what most other options seem to be. It was written by a brilliant engineer and clearly represents some deep understanding of blockchain [technology] and crypto.\nI also like that it is a soft-fork solution that is less disruptive to the network. The reason it (and all other solutions) [hasn\u2019t] been taken is simple \u2014 miners don\u2019t see how they are going to make more money. If you show miners a way to scale the network that also gives them a financial incentive, you\u2019ll have consensus in no time.\nWhich mining pool does Giga Watt point its hashrate at?\nAt the moment, we allow our customers to control that, so we use many pools. I expect to put up a GigaPool later this year that will provide mining for a regional consortium of mining operator-partners. This work is based off my earlier attempts to start a franchise program.\nWhat do you think of Bitcoin Unlimited?\nBitcoin Unlimited is interesting in that it gives miners (pools, really) the ability to choose block size for themselves and change it over time. I think this is pretty creative, but essentially miners will config for whatever makes the most money.\nIf smaller blocks with larger fees makes them money, we will have consensus, but block sizes will still be small. In the future, it will give the biggest pools and those with the most mining power [the ability] to effectively manipulate fees at will.\nThe more recent threats to hard fork the network [are] terrible for bitcoin\u2019s value. A fork would dilute the brand, confuse newcomers and demonstrate just how dangerous centralization has become. The power represented in these recent actions shows who is holding all the cards. We desperately (and quickly) need a balance of power in the mining space \u2014 for too long, investors didn\u2019t pay attention to this part of ecosystem, leaving the door wide open for someone else to take over control.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 23}
{"title": "Humaniq Aims to Tackle Barriers to Economic Inclusion With Blockchain App", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/humaniq-aims-tackle-barriers-economic-inclusion-blockchain-app/", "birthday": "Mar 23, 2017  11:09 AM EST", "date": "2017-03-23 16:09:00", "content": "According to a 2014 World Economic Forum report, there are two billion unbanked people around the world who have no access to banking services. In Southeast Asia, only 27 percent of the region\u2019s 600 million people have a bank account, while in poor countries such as Cambodia, that number is just 5 percent, according to another report issued in 2016 by KPMG.\nYet, it is in these countries that mobile phone use is often high. In Sub-Saharan Africa, of the 350 million adults who lack a bank account, 155 million are reported to own a mobile phone. Whereas in India, the number of mobile subscribers reached the one-billion milestone last January, according to a report from Forbes, revealing huge opportunities to build on its financial inclusion. With mobile phones often costing no more than $20\u201330 at the low end, mobile banking is becoming a viable option.\nLaunched in 2016, Humaniq is designed for those who don\u2019t possess identification, with the mobile app utilizing a new reputation concept based on facial recognition for identity management. The fourth-generation mobile bank is based on the Ethereum blockchain and is attempting to tackle the global problem of financial exclusion for those who don\u2019t have bank accounts. It is set to launch the first version of its mobile app on iOS and Android. \nInitially, the alpha version of the application is by invitation only to 1,000 people; however, they expect to conduct a global rollout by October.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Alex Fork, founder of Humaniq, said that when he was talking with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin at a conference last year, he was struck by how blockchain technology can be a solution to improve the lives of disadvantaged people. After seeing that the current system doesn\u2019t work, Fork decided to create his own tool.\n\u201cUnbanked people find it difficult to use banks for three main reasons: lack of ID, lack of minimum funds and geographical distance to the nearest branch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re using facial and voice recognition technology for new user sign-up.\u201d\nHow It Works\nUsers need to complete the bio-identification process, which takes around 20 seconds and doesn\u2019t require a passport or email. With the use of a smartphone, they take a photo of themselves, record a video of them smiling and grinning, and pronounce the randomly selected text shown on the screen to record their voices. \nUsing modern face-recognition algorithms for neural networks, Humaniq states that it can identify a user with incredible accuracy.\n\u201cOur user interface is not at all text heavy, but rather it\u2019s focused on using images that provide clear instructions even if the user has low literacy,\u201d Fork said.\nHumaniq is also offering users an initial deposit of Humaniq tokens (HMQ) once they pass the bio-identification process. It will also support bitcoin and ether. The HMQ tokens will be used as a medium of exchange for users on the platform, where they can get paid for tasks by third party services that plug into Humaniq such as insurance, data security, small business loans and pensions. Fork says that HMQ has already been approved for trading on several cryptocurrency exchanges, notably SpaceBTC, and that as this is the first time their target users will be experiencing digital currencies they wanted to provide something that was simpler than bitcoin or ether to get them started.\nUsing HMQ tokens will seed the economy of the financial ecosystem, so that it can grow faster, says Fork. As Humaniq envision that microtransactions are going to be the most common ones, bitcoin is cost prohibitive for seeding a new economy. Furthermore, bitcoin has a problem with transaction processing speed and the fees attached to it, but Fork says he\u2019s not ruling the currency out.\n\u201cHumaniq absolutely allows bitcoin as a payment method between parties on our network, and we foresee it being used as a form of wealth storage for users once they\u2019ve built up enough capital to make it worthwhile.\u201d\nFork states that size of the network will be the primary driver of the tokens value. For the ICO stage, due to take place on April 6, they will be tied to the value of ether as a benchmark, but once the project goes live, the market will determine their value.\n\u201cAfter the ICO, the only way to generate new tokens is for new users to sign up, and we have a cap on the maximum number of tokens, so once the network has disbursed all the coins, their value will go up due to the economics of scarcity,\u201d he adds.\nAs the coins can\u2019t be mined by pools, there is no fear that a handful of organizations will dominate the economy.\nEarning Tokens \nUsers will also have the possibility to earn more tokens by performing simple tasks using the app. This is going to be done through a variety of ways such as verifying information about geographic locations to improve google maps, going through websites and checking to see if the links work or moderating comments and videos on YouTube.\nWith money coming in from companies and individuals requesting work to be done, they offer a task and the currency they want to pay for it in such as HMQ, bitcoin or ether. Users then select the task they want to do, agree on a price with the requestor and once the task has been completed satisfactorily, they get paid.\n\u201cMost of these tasks are very low pay, but they represent a significant opportunity to earn income for people who might be earning less than $1,000 a year in equivalent currency,\u201d said Fork. \u201cAn extra $30-60 a month is huge for them.\u201d\nWith over three billion people living on less than $2.50 per day, and at least 80 percent of humanity living on less than $10 per day, income differentials are widening, wrote Fork in his white paper.\nMetcalfe\u2019s Law\nFork states that when people see that they can earn real money and participate in the worldwide economy, they\u2019re going to show this app to others, getting them to use it too.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Metcalfe\u2019s Law, in that the value of a network grows disproportionately larger as the size of the network grows,\u201d he said.\nFork is keen to stress, though, that Humaniq is not a cute app that\u2019s a solution in search of a problem. After visiting slums in India, he knows that the people there are poor, but not incompetent or unclever.\nHumaniq will start their Initial Coin Offering (ICO) on April 6, when they will be sponsoring a startup competition at BlockShow Europe 2017 in Munich. They have already raised over $110,000 in bitcoin and ether during their pre-ICO crowdfunding in a December campaign, beating their target of $68,000, which went toward the development process of the app and website development and participation in conferences.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 23}
{"title": "Gold on the Blockchain: How Two Blockchain Startups Are Digitizing Gold Investments", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/gold-blockchain-how-two-blockchain-startups-are-digitizing-gold-investments/", "birthday": "Mar 24, 2017  11:59 AM EST", "date": "2017-03-24 16:59:00", "content": "Digitizing traditional securities and physical assets has become a new area of interest for investment-focused fintech startups. Turning physical assets into tradable digital assets creates more liquidity and lowers barriers to entry for private investors in asset classes that are traditionally dominated by institutional investors and high net worth individuals. One of these asset classes is the precious metal gold.\nGold has historically always been a popular store of wealth and is regularly added to investment portfolios for the purpose of diversification. However, it is not easy for private individuals to acquire gold bars and store them in a secure vault. Not only are gold bars usually sold at a premium but there is also a cost associated with storing physical gold. \nThe investment management industry has, therefore, created several gold-related investment products such as gold ETFs (exchange-traded funds), gold certificates and gold funds. These investment vehicles provide investors with indirect exposure to gold as an asset class. \u00a0\nTo provide easier access to gold and at a lower cost, several fintech startups are leveraging blockchain technology to digitize gold to open the gold market up to private investors. Two of these startups include Vaultoro and the newly launched Orebits Corp. \nVaultoro\nLondon-based Vaultoro allows users to invest in physical gold using bitcoin. The startup, which was founded in 2015 by Philip Scigala and Joshua Scigala, offers a real-time exchange platform that uses bitcoin as the base currency to buy gold. Traders can trade in and out of both gold and bitcoin with other members of the marketplace 24 hours a day without the need of a bank account to conduct payments. \nWhen a user purchases gold on the online platform, the gold is deposited in an insured gold bullion vault in Switzerland. Vaultoro uses encryption, multisignature storage and locked payout addresses to secure its vaults. It also maintains a transparent public audit both of bitcoin and gold holdings while preserving its customers\u2019 anonymity. \nVaultoro\u2019s intention is not only to provide a platform for gold investment but also to allow the underbanked population to make and receive digital payments using physical gold as a currency. Gold has stood the test of time as a store of wealth and makes for an excellent means of exchange due to its relatively low volatility. \nVaultoro is currently taking part in the 2017 Techstars Berlin Accelerator program, which has been a very beneficial experience for the startup so far. \nVaultoro Co-founder and CEO Joshua Scigala told Bitcoin Magazine: \u201cI always thought that accelerators were just a way for VCs to filter out the good from the bad while earning some extra equity in the process but I was very wrong. Techstars has proven itself to be invaluable. We moved into their office in February, and things started to move very fast. Their network is so big, and the mentors they set you up with are really helpful. There are so many potholes you can trip over along the road to building a startup, having access to countless successful people that have walked the path before you is fantastic because they have torches to highlight the potholes.\n\u201cWe started raising our seed round four days ago and have already got a quarter of the funding round committed,\u201d he added. \nVaultoro\u2019s mission has changed since joining the Techstars Accelerator, Scigala said. \u201cIt\u2019s still to help as many people in the world to transition to private asset\u2013based money (bitcoin, gold and silver) before their savings disappear through another banking crisis or inflation.\u201d \nVaultoro has a lot in the pipeline, but its next step will be to open the bitcoin and gold market up to fiat currency holders. \u201cThe mainstream finds bitcoin too techy and scary, but they understand gold as a safe haven. We are building the easiest and most cost-effective way to save in physical gold and silver, then spend those savings directly using bitcoin or a gold-backed VISA debit card. We are also working to expand our glass books transparency protocol to insert every trade into the blockchain,\u201d said Scigala. \nOrebits\nThe newest player in the blockchain-based gold investment space is Orebits. Orebits Corp, a provider of digitization services for unrefined commodities, has partnered up with smart contracts platform Symbiont to provide smart certificates called \u201corebits\u201d to give private investors the opportunity to invest in digitized gold at a low cost. \n\u201cOrebits\u201d certificates represent digital holdings of proven unrefined gold reserves that can be traded electronically on a peer-to-peer basis, thereby providing liquidity to a previously illiquid asset class. Orebits believes that this increase in liquidity may enable their smart certificates to be utilized for financing, private transactions, collateral or as a line item on a balance sheet.\nCEO Scott Mehlman told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cThe next steps for the Orebits platform, while we continue to digitize reserves, will be to create a vibrant market for the Orebits product. We are in initial conversations with several interested parties who are looking to either make a market in Orebits or even potentially to have Orebits listed on an exchange.\u201d \nMichael Zimits, President & COO of Orebits, added: \u201cWe [also] have the ability, through our technology provider Symbiont, to offer additional precious metals such as platinum, palladium and silver for digitization. This will depend on customer demand.\u201d\nThe partnership between Orebits and Symbiont came about as both companies\u2019 CEOs have had a longstanding relationship from their days in the FX market. They came to recognize that \u00a0Symbiont\u2019s private, permissioned, enterprise-ready distributed ledgers and their smart contracts and smart certificates solutions were ideal for creating new digitized commodity investment products. \nSymbiont Co-founder and CEO Mark Smith stated, \u201cWe are excited to be working with Orebits Corp. to bring yet another distributed ledger project from prototype into production. Orebits Corp.\u2019s innovation has created a new avenue for investors to gain exposure to gold, starting at the genesis moment for financial instruments that are tied to gold \u2014 namely, when the gold is still in the ground.\u201d\nThanks to blockchain technology, private individuals are now able to have easy, low-cost access to gold as an investment, which has previously been reserved as a store of wealth only for the wealthy. As the digitization of traditional assets continues, we can expect more physical commodities to become investable digital assets that everyone with an internet connection will have access to in the near future.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 24}

Mobi accounts are simply linked to users\u2019 mobile numbers and therefore a smartphone is all that is needed to use the app.\nThe main feature of BTCC\u2019s Mobi app is the BTCC bitcoin debit card, which operates just like a normal bitcoin wallet. Funds in the wallet are pegged to the debit card and balance is automatically deducted when users make payments at retail points of sale (POS) that accept Visa or withdraw cash via bank ATMs.\nIt is BTCC\u2019s first initiative to target a global consumer base and expand its services outside of China. Both the Mobi wallet and the debit card are available in 15 languages and can be utilized in any country across the world.\nBTCC announced:\n\u201cMobi comes with an optional Visa debit card. The debit card is linked to users\u2019 Mobi accounts, and allows them to withdraw cash in any currency at ATMs worldwide or spend their funds at any retail points of sale that support Visa. The debit card automatically deducts funds from customers\u2019 wallet balance.\u201d\nSince the launch of Xapo\u2019s bitcoin Visa debit card in late 2014, the popularity of physical bitcoin cards has continued to rise. As bitcoin companies started to drift away from manufacturing bitcoin ATMs due to high operating costs and manufacturing fees, venture capital\u2013backed companies such as South Korea\u2019s Coinplug and global payments service provider BitPay began to develop unique products to meet the demands and necessities of their consumers.\nEssentially, the launch of the BTCC bitcoin debit card eliminates the necessity of bitcoin ATMs and offers higher liquidity to daily users within China. According to LocalBitcoins, its over-the-counter and peer-to-peer trading volumes have increased exponentially in the last three months due to the intensified Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies in China. \nToday, for instance, it was revealed that Chinese bitcoin exchanges regularly request users to submit relevant information on deposits and withdrawals with detailed explanations on the origins and the outflows of transactions.\nBTCC\u2019s bitcoin debit cards will allow Chinese users to utilize bitcoin with ease, without undergoing strictly regulated channels to make simple purchases and transfers. More important, in regions wherein bitcoin ATMs or services aren\u2019t available, Chinese bitcoin users will simply be able to cash out their funds via bank ATMs.\nIn a Reddit discussion, a BTCC representative explained how Mobi is different from Xapo: \n\u201cWe support 100+ currencies, so for the debit card, if you have money in your USD wallet, the card will deduct funds from the USD wallet for purchases. If you don't have money in your USD wallet, we will automatically convert bitcoin into USD when you use your card.\u201d\nWirex, the largest bitcoin debit company in Asia, recently secured a $27 million investment from Japan\u2019s SBI Investment to focus on the development and expansion of their bitcoin debit cards. Bitcoin companies within the Asian market are particularly focused on improving usability of bitcoin and introducing the digital currency to the mainstream market. \nBTCC\u2019s introduction of bitcoin debit cards to its Chinese user base will position China to compete with Japan, South Korea and the Philippines over the bitcoin ATM and debit card markets.\nWith multi-currency support, BTCC is eyeing a global expansion of their services, including the bitcoin debit card. Although Wirex is focusing on the Japanese market, BTCC will compete with startups including Wirex and Coinplug in the Asian market to obtain a truly international user base.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 24}

Amid global market uncertainty, onerous regulations and a cautious investment climate on the heels of the Trump election, a new technological innovation is rapid emerging.\nKnown as blockchain technology, this distributed ledger advancement promises to create a leaner, more efficient and more profitable financial services world. This technology, which undergirds Bitcoin and many other forms of digital currency, is poised to create a new normal for how money is transacted. By providing a secure and transparent means of digitally tracking asset ownership, it could transform everything from how stock exchanges function to how stock proxies get voted on. Throughout the global stage, banks, investment networks and even governments are pouring money into the curation and testing of blockchains. \nAll of this comes on the heels of the highly anticipated decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on whether or not to approve the first ever bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). \nAnd just last month, the world\u2019s largest banks moved forward with a major advancement on the blockchain though the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which serves as the back end of most Wall Street trading. Here, one of the DTCC databases, the Trade Information Warehouse, will be re-platformed onto distributed ledger technology \u2014 a project led by IBM which has long been a champion of distributed technology. When fully functional, it is believed that this project will positively disrupt the capital markets industry, bringing a level of efficiency to the financial world that has never been witnessed before in post-trade processing. It is anticipated that this project will be ready for business in 2018. \nThe Building Blocks of Alliance\nRon Quaranta, chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance (WSBA), says that the organization he leads serves as a neutral, unbiased steward of education and cooperation between Wall Street firms, with a mission to guide and promote comprehensive adoption of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies across financial markets. \n\u201cWe work to address the myriad of issues that have been and will continue to be part of blockchain adoption. As happens with any innovative technology, we are working with members across multiple fronts including education and training, implementation and integration, regulatory guidance and initiatives, strategic development and more. Our goal is to become the financial industry source for strategic advice, knowledge and resource[s] in a blockchain world.\u201d \nQuaranta notes that the WSBA was formed late in 2015, as he and several colleagues across banking, brokerage, law, trading and fintech realized that the rising interest in blockchain technology across global financial markets would require a nonprofit trade association to develop and guide this new technology going forward. \n\u201cThere is [a] growing library of knowledge regarding blockchain technology, and we are certainly in a more knowledgeable position than we were in 2015,\u201d says Quaranta. \u201cThat said, there is still a large majority of firms and personnel across financial markets that have little to no knowledge of blockchain [technology] or are struggling to understand it in the midst of overwhelming news and sometimes unclear information.\u201d \nQuaranta believes that the industry will continue to advance in small steps for a bit \u2014 a development that is \u201cheartening\u201d to see in terms of level of interest as well as the proliferation of viable use cases. In addition, he notes, major technology providers to financial markets have entered the arena \u2014 a development that will increase the velocity of adoption. \nExisting Barriers to Adoption\nThere are a few barriers to widespread blockchain adoption on Wall Street at present that have garnered the most attention, according to Quaranta. One is the ongoing lack of expertise and resources needed for firms to review use cases and implement basic prototypes. \n\u201cWhile there are certainly large firms and innovative startups dedicating resources to this, many of which are frequently in the financial news media touting relevant and interesting projects, we are not yet at the point of broad-spectrum tool sets being available to wide portions of financial markets,\u201d he says. \nQuaranta also thinks that lack of awareness and understanding of blockchain technology at the executive levels is another hurdle that needs to be overcome. \n\u201cThis needs to be done with an eye toward not just describing cost savings, but also what I call the \u2018ROI of blockchain.\u2019 We need to work as an industry to understand the best benefits of blockchain [technology], understand what use cases make sense, which do not make sense, and ultimately have a deep understanding of how financial markets do what they do, and what parts need to evolve for the future.\u201d \u00a0\nThen there is the compliance factor. The industry is still weighed down by a lack of a cohesive regulatory framework around digital currencies and blockchain technology, with multiple federal and state agencies weighing in with proposed rules and oversight that make it difficult to develop a longer-term strategy. \nQuaranta suggests that the tide is shifting, however, to where regulators are attempting to understand blockchain technology and digital currencies more, and trying to be a part of the innovation versus wanting to suppress it.\nLooking toward the future, Quaranta believes that over the next 12 to 18 months we will see more and more \u201cpilots\u201d or moves into blockchain-based production systems. These, he says, will be incremental moves over time but will fuel a growing awareness of possible use cases for blockchain technology in multiple parts of financial markets, as well as in other industries. \n\u201cI believe we\u2019re going to see a growing body of expertise in blockchain technology, and I would argue we will begin to envision ways that it can be used in conjunction with other technologies, such as VR/AR, artificial intelligence, machine learning and more. I also expect that we will see growing variety of types of financial instruments based upon cryptocurrencies, with availability worldwide \u2014 in fact, the dawn of which new asset classes based on blockchain [technology] and cryptocurrencies will be something I suspect we will see in the future, but time will tell.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 9}

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nBitcoin price pulled back 6.5 percent today, largely on a technical M double top breakdown, but a People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) announcement aided in the drop. Although the announcement was certainly better than previous announcements, Chinese exchanges will remain under strict supervision. An outright bitcoin ban from the PBoC at this point seems very unlikely.\nWith the pending SEC COIN ETF decision expected on (or before) Friday, we can expect increased volatility leading into the weekend. Unlike Forex and other legacy markets, Bitcoin markets are open 24/7, which will allow for trading even at the end of business on Friday, should the decision be announced late in the day. \nAlso on Friday, OKCoin futures contracts will settle at 8AM UTC, which in the past has also called for increased volatility around the closing or opening or weekly, biweekly, or quarterly contracts.\nThe M double top can be easily seen on the thirty minute time frame. An \u201cM\u201d signifies \u201cMurder\u201d or an imminent pullback from a top, whereas a \u201cW\u201d signifies \u201cWinner\u201d or an imminent bounce from a bottom. Although this may seem retrospective, as the second top fails to make a higher high, a short is viable with a tight stop just above the second local high. \nPrice found support in a previous resistance zone and had an automatic rally to the 0.618 fibonacci retracement level. \nOver the next few days, we should expect an Adam & Eve double bottom to form, leading into Friday. This pattern is named for the sharp \u2018V\u2019 formation following a rally from a pullback, and a second pullback at horizontal resistance with a smooth \u2018U\u2019 formation. A break of the horizontal resistance should yield a measured move target of ~$1300.\nOn the daily time frame, it is also apparent that price found support in the $1150-$1200 zone, which previously was resistance. There was also a large bearish divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which is an oscillator that measures momentum in price. A new higher high in price followed by a lower RSI signifies weakening bullish momentum in price action which suggests a pullback.\nLastly, bitcoin price remains above gold parity, coincidence or not. Not until the price of bitcoin stabilizes above the price of gold for a few weeks can we be (somewhat) sure of the significance of this marker, assuming it matters at all.\nSummary\n1. With OKCoin futures settlement early Friday morning and an SEC COIN ETF announcement likely by late Friday, expect increased volatility on Friday leading into the weekend.\n2. Price broke down largely due to a technical pattern including an M double top and bearish divergence on the daily timeframe. This technical resistance was aided by a PBoC announcement which was surprisingly mild compared to previous regulatory decisions recently.\n3. Currently, half of an Adam & Eve double bottom has formed. Should it complete, expect a target of ~$1300.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

In this article, I will show how economics will play an important factor in deciding which scenario occurs.\nMining Basics\nA miner\u2019s revenue comes down to a few factors\u200a: the value of Bitcoin, the transaction fees generated per block, and the miner\u2019s hashpower compared to the difficulty. The miner\u2019s expenses will typically include electricity (a significant part), facilities (rent, taxes, etc\u2026), operations (staff to make sure everything is working, cost of running the IT infrastructure to operate), and depreciation of mining equipment. The equation can be simplified in most cases to having a cost per hash, which does not depend on which chain someone mines, so it can be ignored for analysis.\nMining in a Chain Split\nWhen a chain split occurs, each chain will have a different value, and eventually, differing difficulty. Since a miner\u2019s expenses will typically not differ according to which chain they are mining, profit-motivated miners will seek the maximum revenue. The maximum revenue will depend on two factors\u200a: \u200athe expected reward per block and the difficulty of finding such a block. There are even mining pools that opportunistically will shift which coins they mine based on current market conditions to maximize revenue for their hashers. While some miners may mine ideologically or for strategic reasons, Bitcoin\u2019s economic model tends to assume that hashers will seek profits. Given the low barrier to entry and relative anonymity of hashing, any presence of ideological miners will be negated by profit-seeking miners who mine the opposite chain.\nEvaluating Which Chain to Mine\nWhen evaluating which chain to mine, a miner should use the following equation to calculate expected daily revenue:\n([block reward in unit of account + expected fees in unit of account]) * (# expected blocks/day).\nFor simplicity, we\u2019ll assume that the block reward in coin amount and fees in coin amount are the same, although it\u2019s easy to expand this case later.\nThe expected blocks/day is equal to the mining hashpower divided by the expected network hashpower (based on difficulty). The difficulty reflects the average hashpower of the previous difficulty adjustment period. The rate at which you find blocks is independent of the network\u2019s total *actual* hashpower, only the difficulty matters. For example, if you have 10% of the hashpower average of the previous period, you will mine 14.4 blocks per day on average for the next difficulty period, even if the total hashpower changes on your chain during the next period.\nRevenue mining Chain A: [Price of A] * Block Reward * [My Hashpower / Total Hashpower of last period].\nRevenue of mining Chain B: [Price of B] * Block Reward * [My Hashpower/ Total Hashpower last period].\nWe want to know which chain is more profitable to mine. \nIf [Revenue A] / [Revenue B] > 1, then mine A, otherwise, mine B.\nWe can simplify the equation down to ([Price of A]/[Difficulty A]) > ([Price of B]/[Difficulty B]), meaning you should mine A, otherwise B. Eventually both chains will reach an equilibrium where the difficulty of each chain is proportional to the price.\nImplications for Resolutions of Chain Splits\nIn my previous article, I outlined four types of chain splits. In the case of the Incompatible Hard Fork, both chains will never resolve and no massive reorganization is possible. For the other cases, a chain reorganization is possible. If the amount of total work on the invulnerable chain exceeds the vulnerable chain, the vulnerable chain will be annihilated.\nAbove, we determined that the difficulty of each chain will be proportional to the prices of each. The difficulty reflects the amount of work being added to each chain. Thus, if the difficulty of one chain exceeds the other for long enough, it will eventually contain more work. \nSimplifying based on the previous equations, the chain that maintains the highest value will eventually have the most work. Thus, any chain that is vulnerable to reorganization MUST remain at a higher value than the other chain for eternity in order for it to resist a massive reorganization.\nChris Belcher posted an interesting point on the bitcoin-dev mailing list:\n\"Because the segwit-invalid coins can be annihilated in this way and\u00a0segwit-valid coins cannot, segwit-invalid coins are more risky to hold\u00a0as an asset, all else [being] equal.\n\"A more risky asset has a lower price, all else being equal because investors\u00a0demand higher risk premiums for holding it, while short sellers may\u00a0sell down the price in the hopes of making a profit if its value goes\u00a0to zero.\"\nBased on this idea, it becomes an even bigger challenge for the vulnerable chain to retain a higher value, simply because it might not have a higher value at a later date.\nAdjusting for varying block rewards\nIn the event of varying block rewards (including varying fees), the equation will just need a slight modification. Simply replace the price of each coin with a \u201creward in local currency\u201d factor. Thus coin A with a 50 coin reward and 1 coin average fee and price of $100/coin can be compared to coin B with a 25 coin reward, 2 coin average fee, and price of $150/coin. In this case, both chains will converge to difficulty ratios of (51*$100)/(27*$150). In the event that Coin B should become valued at $188.89 or more, it would actually begin to produce more work than Coin A, and eventually annihilate it.\nConclusion\nStaying on a chain that is vulnerable to reorganization is a risky proposition. As long as there is any reasonable interest in both chains, not only must it maintain the majority of hashpower immediately after the fork, but it has the possibility of being annihilated for some time after. Due to this risk, it will push the price of that chain downward, thus becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy where it drives the value down to the point where the mining majority has economic incentives to switch to the invulnerable chain, thus leading to a single chain with the stricter rules.\nThis guest post by Alphonse Pace was originally published on\u00a0Medium\u00a0and is reproduced here under a\u00a0Creative Commons License.\n\n", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 8}
{"title": "Guest Post: Chain Splits and Resolutions", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/guest-post-chain-splits-and-resolutions/", "birthday": "Mar 7, 2017  4:29 PM EST", "date": "2017-03-07 21:29:00", "content": "Software engineer, Bitcoin user since 2011.\nAn often misunderstood topic is that of chain splits and how they are potentially resolved. With the recent proposal from Shaolinfry discussing User Activated Soft Forks (UASF) getting much attention, these misunderstandings must be clarified to fully understand the implications of chain splits and their potential resolutions.\nTypes of Forks\nMiners can create chain splits through the deliberate orphaning of blocks that appear to be valid to some clients. Users maintain a set of consensus rules that they require of all blocks. When users disagree about the sets of consensus rules to enforce, they will follow a different chain. To simplify discussion, we\u2019ll skip the case where the consensus rules are agreed upon, but miners decide to orphan blocks for other reasons, and cases where there are more than two sets of consensus rules. \nIn the following examples, there are two sets of rules, the Red rules and the Yellow rules. In these examples, the Red rules are original rules being enforced, and the Yellow rules are the modified rules. Orange rules are the combination of both Red and Yellow rules (both rule sets agree that these blocks are valid).\nIncompatible Hard Fork\nAn incompatible is the simplest type of chain split to understand. At a certain block height, some users decide to implement a new ruleset. In this case, the new ruleset is completely independent of the original rules.\n\nIncompatible Hard Fork\n\nA hard fork occurs after some miners decide to mine on the new ruleset, and some continue on the old ruleset. No block produced under the new rules is valid under the old rules, and vice versa. The Ethereum/Ethereum Classic split is an example of this kind of split. In this case, the chains are eternally split with no chance of ever converging, no matter how much work is mined into each chain.\nSemi-Compatible Hard Forks\nA semi-compatible hard fork occurs whenever the rulesets intersect, but there are some blocks that are valid on only one of the chains for each chain.\n\nSemi-Compatible Fork\nIn these cases, miners can prevent a chain split by mining only Orange rule blocks. However, once a miner mines a Red or Yellow block, the chain splits. It is possible for the chains to converge if miners eventually put together an exclusively Orange chain starting from when the users accepted Yellow rules that surpassed the total work of both of the other chains. If they ever did this, both the Red/Orange and Yellow/Orange chains would be orphaned by Red/Yellow clients, and they would see a single chain. There are no major forks of this type that I am aware of. \nThe best bet for miners in this case (depending on the specifics) would typically be to just mine Orange blocks, preventing any chain split. By doing so, miners are effectively turning a Semi-compatible fork into a Soft Fork.\nCompatible Hard Fork\nIn a hard fork, the ruleset expands, to include all of the previous rules, but also allowing other conditions.\n\nHard Fork\nWhen the rules expand, as soon as a miner mines a block with the Yellow rules, the chain splits. This type of split will diverge as long as the Yellow chain contains more work than the Orange chain. One danger in this type of split is that if the Orange chain contains more work, the Yellow chain will be orphaned. Users of the Yellow chain must not only be sure that a vast majority of hashpower will be on this chain initially, but will continue to be on this chain for eternity. Examples of this type of fork include Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited.\nSoft Fork\nA soft fork is when the ruleset is tightened and the Yellow rules are completely covered by the Red rules (thus only Orange and Red rulesets).\n\nThe chain split can occur whenever a miner creates a Red block. Users who use the Red ruleset will follow that chain, and users who use the Yellow ruleset will follow the Orange chain. In this case, if the majority of hashpower ever starts enforcing the Orange rules, the Red chain will become orphaned. This type of fork occurred in Bitcoin\u2019s history numerous times with changes such as BIP66, CSV, CLTV, and is in the proposed SegWit Soft Fork.\nReorganization Risk and Split Risks\nBoth massive reorganizations and chain splits present dangers to users and miners. A massive reorganization can cause previously accepted transactions to disappear, which will guarantee that a large number of people will lose money in the process. \nIn this case, for example, perhaps a year ago you were paid 10BTC for your car, and a year later, that transaction essentially disappears from the ledger and your chain is abandoned. You have no car and no Bitcoins. This type of behavior would cause a great loss of confidence in the currency. Depending on the type of split, a massive reorganization will only affect users of the looser ruleset. Users of the tighter ruleset will never get reorganized.\nA chain split also presents risk. The value of Ethereum took a tumble after it split from Ethereum Classic. It added confusion to the marketplace (Which is really Ethereum? The one with the original rules, or the one with the rules the centralized Ethereum Foundation enforces today?). A chain split affects all users adversely. There are cases where a split may be preferred (say, two groups have vastly different interests and are best served following their own wants, rather than compromising).\nMitigating Risk\nRisk for most of these forks can be mitigated by both miners and users, in most cases.\nFor an incompatible hard fork, no mitigation plan can occur. The chain IS splitting, so long as some miners and some users want it to. There is nothing that can happen. This is the equivalent of getting a divorce decree and parting ways, never to interact again.\nFor a semi-compatible soft fork, miners have the power to prevent both a chain fork and massive reorganization. If the majority of miners choose to mine only Orange blocks, users will remain on one chain and reorganizations will be limited to a small number of blocks.\nFor a compatible hard fork, risk is exclusively on the Yellow rule users. Their best mitigation is to ensure the majority of the economy is on their side. It\u2019s also important to make sure the majority of the miners are also on their side initially, otherwise the chain will not split. Without the majority of the economy, the value of the Orange blocks will be greater, thus pulling miners interested in profit to their side, leading to a massive reorganization. \nExtreme care must be taken in this scenario (something that was not present with Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, nor the proposed Bitcoin Unlimited). The former would activate with a mere 75% of hashpower, and Bitcoin Unlimited has no threshold for activation.\nFor a soft fork, the risk is exclusively on the Red rule users. Their best mitigation strategy is to ensure that they have the economy on their side, and the vast majority of miners following the Red rules OR the vast majority of miners on the Orange rules. \nThis may seem a bit counterintuitive, but if the vast majority of miners are mining the Orange rules, then they will remain in consensus with the Orange users and will not get Orphaned. Miners can mitigate this by only mining blocks in the Orange set and orphaning the Red set.\nMiners have a significant role in mitigating this risk. In every case except the Incompatible Hard Fork, the miners can prevent a chain fork. For the semi-compatible hard fork, they can do this by converting it into a soft fork. For the compatible hard fork, they can only do this by rejecting the hard fork. For the soft fork case, they do this by enforcing the soft fork. However, even without the miners doing this, users have an incentive to protect themselves by enforcing the Orange rules and rejecting anything does not meet them. This means rejecting hard forks and enforcing soft forks.\n\nEpilogue: Escaping a Miner-Imposed Ruleset Change\nMany, including Jeff Garzik, have cast suspicion upon soft forks because they do not give users a choice. The nature of Bitcoin and other Proof-of-Work based blockchains cannot prevent miners from enforcing stricter rules than users agree to. However, users do have power\u200a \u2014\u200a by invoking an incompatible hard fork. \nIn this case, users will force the chain to split by introducing a new ruleset (which may include a proof-of-work change, but does not require one). This ensures users always have an escape from a miner-imposed ruleset that they reject. This way, if the economy and users truly reject a soft fork rule change, they always have the power to break away and reclaim the rules they wish. It may be inconvenient, but the same is true of any attack by the miners on users.\nThis guest post by Alphonse Pace was originally published on Medium\u00a0and is reproduced here under a Creative Commons License.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 7}

Now, using blockchain technology companies are tackling this issue and attempting to improve consumer confidence in the food industry to ensure authenticity in food traceability.\nExposed in mid-January 2013, Irish food inspectors announced that they had found horsemeat in frozen beef burgers made by companies in the Irish Republic and the U.K. after tests discovered horse DNA within them. It was revealed that these had been sold by several U.K. supermarket chains such as Tesco, Iceland, Aldi and Lidl, growing to include European stores including Findus and Nestle.\nUnsurprisingly, the integrity of the food industry has taken a hit. Before the scandal broke, nine in ten people felt confident when purchasing food at the supermarket. Now, though, the number has dropped to seven in ten. A report from the Guardian shows that 38 percent of supermarket foods were found to be mislabeled or fraudulent, which can have long-lasting effects on the retailer\u2019s reputation.\nFurthermore, research from the World Health Organization found that 1 in 10 people in the world suffer from foodborne illnesses, 420,000 of whom die each year, many of them young children.\nWith offices in Edinburgh, Belfast and San Francisco, arc-net was formed following the 2013 horsemeat scandal and the subsequent Elliot government report in 2014.The platform is designed to deliver confidence in a global supply chain where producers have complete control of their brand and business. Through the establishment of stronger relationships with those in the supply chain, organizations can receive the correct information they need, ensuring that food products are 100 percent authentic and traceable.\nAccording to research, following the horsemeat scandal, consumer trust in the food industry dropped by a quarter. Additionally, 30 percent of shoppers are now buying less processed meat, and a further 24 percent are purchasing fewer ready meals with meat in them or are opting for vegetarian dishes instead. \nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Sean Crossey, associate digital marketing analyst at arc-net, said that the scandal and the findings of the report brought into focus the gaps in knowledge relating to the food supply.\n\u201cAs the issue of counterfeit products and fraudulent activity became more and more prevalent in our marketplace, there was a real need to address the gap in information relating to supply chain activity and brand authenticity,\u201d he said.\nA study by PwC and Safe and Secure Approaches in Field Environments (SSAFE) found last January that each year, food fraud is estimated to be a $40 billion problem worldwide. In the U.K., fraud costs the food and drink industry up to \u00a311 billion per year ($13.6 billion), according to research by PFK Littlejohn. However, by tackling fraud, the food and drink industry could boost profits by \u00a34.48 billion ($5.45 billion). \nFurthermore, a campaign from Oceana has found that food fraud is cheating Americans out of up to $25 billion a year. As such, with the food supply chain expanding its global reach, it is becoming increasingly vulnerable to fraud. \nHow It Works\nThrough its immutable data history, the blockchain delivers openness and transparency, from creation through to consumption, for the consumer. \nIn the case of arc-net, analysis of a DNA sample from an animal can provide key markers, such as country of origin. A digital copy of that DNA is attached to every item or product an organization creates, bringing traceability to the item level, rather than to an entire batch, thereby allowing businesses to track each item throughout every stage of the supply chain. \nThat digital marker can then be cross-checked with the blockchain record to ensure the product\u2019s authenticity throughout its lifecycle. The process allows producers to create a \u201cchain of custody.\u201d \nOnce the food lands on a retailer\u2019s shelf, consumers can scan a QR code on the food package with their mobile phones to receive food safety information about the product, including details as to what is in the package and its origination.\n\u201cThis [process] helps organizations prevent fraud while delivering total traceability, cutting the costs of product recalls and reducing process inefficiencies,\u201d said Crossey. \u201cIt ensures that retailers can guarantee the authenticity of the food that reaches their shelves.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 8}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nEthereum Classic is preparing another hard fork. It was announced in statements published last week that the project\u2019s development and mining community is committing to a change in its monetary policy by December of this year. Essentially a move to a new protocol, all current Ethereum Classic users and miners should have upgraded their software by then.\n\nIf everyone does not upgrade their software, the project can split into two incompatible networks, blockchains and currencies. Of course, that is exactly how Ethereum Classic itself broke away from the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s Ethereum last summer. \nAnd, if it\u2019s up to Reddit user \u201cIgnatius_G_Reilly,\u201d history will repeat itself by the end of this year:\n\u201cIf the Ethereum Classic project had any value in the first place, then Ethereum Classic Classic is its true champion.\u201d\nThe Revamped Monetary Policy\nA revamped monetary policy has been high up on Ethereum Classic\u2019s priority list for some time. \nThe project started increasingly differentiating itself from Ethereum since the split. Ethereum Classic is in no rush to move to proof of stake, for example, and it recently diffused the \u201cdifficulty bomb\u201d that would have forced its developers\u2019 hands. Part of the distinguishing effort, some suggested that a change in monetary policy would help investors properly evaluate the classic ether token (ETC).\n\u201cEthereum will adopt a new monetary policy when they move to proof of stake mining,\u201d Ethereum Classic\u2019s pseudonymous project coordinator, \u201carvicco,\u201d told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe won\u2019t switch to proof of stake anytime soon. But in order for a platform token to be viable, the monetary policy could not be \u2018undefined.\u2019\u201d\nThe upcoming monetary policy is formalized in ECIP 1017 (Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposal 1017), drafted by Matthew \u201csnaproll\u201d Mazur. Resembling Bitcoin\u2019s gold-like properties, ECIP 1017 places a hard cap on the total amount of tokens to be issued on the Ethereum Classic blockchain. Specifically, it is \u201ctithing\u201d a 20 percent reward reduction about every two years, meaning the supply will be capped around 210 million ETC. The vast majority of coins should be mined around 2070.\nWhile ECIP 1017 was not the only contender for a monetary policy change, it did take an early lead. And now, it\u2019s the only concrete proposal left, arvicco said:\n\u201cNo competing technical proposals were adopted by any teams, and the key stakeholders in the ecosystem expressed their support for ECIP 1017.\u201d\nHard Forks\nEthereum Classic, of course, originally emerged as a sort of protest movement: a protest against the DAO \u201cbailout,\u201d a protest against the centralized decision-making process by the Ethereum Foundation and, perhaps especially, a protest in favor of immutability. As a guiding rod for the project, the state of the blockchain should not be altered, even if it displeases its users.\nBut that does not mean Ethereum Classic opposes all hard forks. Like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic hard forked in 2016 to counter a type of spam attack. And as mentioned, it also hard forked to dismantle the difficulty bomb. In both cases, the community agrees these protocol changes did not violate the project\u2019s principles of immutability.\nOn the other hand, while Ethereum implemented the \u201cSpurious Dragon\u201d hard fork to rid their blockchain of empty spam accounts, Ethereum Classic did not. Though some Ethereum Classic users considered this hard fork desirable, others believed it to be a violation of immutability. Given this division, the community decided against Spurious Dragon.\nPerhaps, therefore, \u201cimmutability\u201d itself is not the only requirement to adopt a hard fork; it\u2019s not always necessarily clear when \u201cimmutability\u201d is or isn\u2019t violated. Rather, as for any decentralized and blockchain-based currency, an underlying requirement is widespread consensus; in this case, consensus over when \u201cimmutability\u201d is violated \u2014 and when it is not.\nTo build consensus for the upcoming hard fork, the change in monetary policy has been extensively discussed, arvicco said:\n\u201cEveryone had ample opportunity to make their case during the discussions on Slack, conferences and events we held as a community. We don\u2019t have the luxury of a \u2018benevolent dictator,\u2019 so we had to form [our] position through discussion and compromise.\u201d\nAs a result of this process, the different development teams working on Ethereum Classic have now agreed to implement the hard fork, a decision that is backed by Ethereum Classic\u2019s most important mining pools, investors and more.\n\u201cBut when all is said and done, Ethereum Classic users will either support the proposed changes by adopting compatible clients,\u201d arvicco concluded, \u201cor not.\u201d\nEthereum Classic Classic\nAnd now that the announcement to hard fork is made public, it seems maybe not everyone agrees with the change in monetary policy after all. While it so far appears to be a small minority, some Reddit users \u2014 mostly absent when the change was debated \u2014 are criticizing the announcement. \nIndeed, the proposed hard fork may just spark another protest movement: Ethereum Classic Classic was announced last week\nSo far consisting of a GitHub page, a subreddit and a Twitter account, Ignatius_G_Reilly is leading the charge.\n\u201cThis attempt at central planning of the monetary supply is an artificial limitation of the Ethereum Classic inflation rate, providing no other service than suggesting a \u2018rarity\u2019 of the ETC token meant to influence market perception,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIn no way does this arbitrary decision help the continued functioning of the Ethereum Classic chain.\u201d\nLampooning the subreddit sidebar of Ethereum Classic, Ethereum Classic Classic echoes the protest sentiment of the early Ethereum Classic days. \u201cWe believe in a strong separation of concerns, whereby system forks are possible only to correct actual platform bugs or provide functionality upgrades, not to bail out failed smart contracts, associated special interest groups, or aspirant central bankers,\u201d it reads.\nIgnatius_G_Reilly added:\n\u201cThe planned Ethereum Classic hard fork is in no way a \u2018functionality upgrade,\u2019 and certainly constitutes a \u2018bail-out\u2019 of \u2018associated special interest groups.\u2019\u201d\nAnd there seems to be another similarity, too. Perhaps surprisingly, the Ethereum Classic project last summer garnered support from people who never cared for Ethereum itself. This included so-called \u201cBitcoin maximalists\u201d who really just wanted to frustrate Ethereum\u2019s hard fork \u2014 or have some fun with it.\nEthereum Classic Classic, so far, likewise appears to be supported by critics that never really cared about Ethereum Classic in the first place. In much the same way that \u201cBitcoin maximalists\u201d supported Ethereum Classic, some Ethereum proponents are now backing Ethereum Classic Classic.\n\u201cThe humor employed in our communication is not \u2018trolling,\u2019 but [is] really used to underline the absurdity of the Ethereum Classic project itself,\u201d Ignatius_G_Reilly said. \u201cTaking a step back, Ethereum is where the real game is happening.\u201d\nBut therein may also lie a difference. \nEthereum Classic was initiated by a Russian-speaking segment of Ethereum users, and subsequently embraced by other Ethereum users in opposition to the DAO hard fork. While supported by \u201cBitcoin maximalists,\u201d the heart of the project consisted of a group of people who self-identified as members of the Ethereum community.\nEthereum Classic Classic, so far, seems to be supported mainly by Ethereum Classic critics. Whether this alone is enough to sustain a digital currency remains to be seen. With some 60 followers on Twitter, about 30 subreddit subscribers, no known developers, no mining pools and no businesses coming out in support of the project so far, Ethereum Classic Classic has a long way to go.\nIgnatius_G_Reilly, however, seemed hopeful:\n\u201cWe are rallying resources and contributors and will make a further announcement on this subject.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 8}

The prominent Bitcoin entrepreneurs and investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss filed for their bitcoin ETF for the first time back in mid-2013 and have yet to receive a decision from the financial regulator. However, as there is a limited timeline when it comes to securities approvals, the SEC is forced to make a decision by the end of this week. \nThis ETF would allow institutional investors to invest in bitcoin without actually needing to buy or hold the digital currency themselves; it would be held by a custodian, the Winklevoss\u2019 Gemini Trust Company.\nWhat Would a Bitcoin ETF Mean for Bitcoin? \nShould the SEC approve the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF, we can expect there to be an immediate rally in the price of bitcoin as investors would expect large fund inflows into the ETF throughout the year, which would lead to the fund having to purchase underlying bitcoins to meet investor demand. \nFurthermore, should the SEC approve the Winklevoss ETF, it would pave the way for other digital currency ETFs to become publicly listed later this year. The Digital Currency Group\u2019s investment subsidiary, Grayscale Investments, announced in January that it has filed to publicly list a bitcoin ETF, and SolidX Partners filed their bitcoin ETF in July 2016. More publicly traded investment funds would very likely mean more funds flowing into the digital currency, which could see it rally substantially, should large institutional investors add bitcoin exposure to their multibillion-dollar portfolios. \nSpencer Bogart, head of research at Blockchain Capital, said to Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cOn the one hand, the intense focus on the prospects of the Winklevoss ETF is warranted given that it would open the gates of bitcoin to institutional capital (which could significantly impact price) and because it would simultaneously drive a favorable shift in public perception of bitcoin while also decreasing regulatory risk. On the other hand, bitcoin doesn\u2019t need an ETF; adoption will continue growing regardless, and it will be great to return the discussion to bitcoin\u2019s compelling fundamental growth story.\u201d\nThe approval of the ETF would also give bitcoin an official stamp of approval as a legitimate asset class. Given bitcoin\u2019s struggle to fight off its negative image associated with the dark web and drug sales, this would be a big step forward for Bitcoin to establish itself as a viable global payment network. \nCo-Founder of U.K.-based Bitcoin startup Wirex Dmitry Lazarichev told Bitcoin Magazine: \u201cThe approval can take Bitcoin adoption to another level. However, given the lack of fundamental regulation standards describing what Bitcoin and blockchain [technology] are, the decision might be very subjective.\u201d\nDespite Optimism, the Likelihood of SEC Approval Is Rather Low\nAccording to the SEC website, \u201cThe mission of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.\u201d \nGiven bitcoin\u2019s extreme volatility, its large trading volumes outside of the U.S. (most notably in China), the inability to identify large holders and its somewhat-tainted reputation as the new currency of the criminal underworld, many experts think that it is rather unlikely that the SEC will approve the ETF, given its mission statement. \nBlake Estes, a counsel in Alston & Bird\u2019s Financial Services & Products group, echoed these sentiments. \u201cThe future may be bright for bitcoin, but the key question for the SEC is whether or not that asset class is ready now for broad public consumption,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cI think the primary areas of regulatory concern for the SEC with the bitcoin markets, generally, have to do with liquidity and security. In addition, I think the SEC might be reluctant to approve a product that has, historically, been closely tied to illicit uses.\u201d \nEstes estimated the chance of an ETF approval at \u201cless than 50 percent\u201d and cited potential conflict-of-interest concerns. \n\u201cIn addition, during the course of its review of WBT, the SEC has, apparently, raised questions regarding structural conflicts of interest with WBT that could create incentives for the ETF sponsor, as an affiliate of the exchange from which the bitcoin reference price will be determined and the ETF\u2019s custodian, to put its own interests ahead of the interests of the ETF\u2019s future public shareholders.\u201d \nThe Investment Bank Needham & Co, which regularly publishes research reports covering bitcoin\u2019s price development, believes that there is only a sub-25 percent chance of approval for the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF this week, pointing out that the SEC will need to assess whether \u201cthe state of the bitcoin market is sufficiently developed, fair and transparent for an ETF,\u201d among other factors. \n\u201cThere will inevitably be a bitcoin ETF, due to both demand and the asset\u2019s complexity,\u201d said Jeremy Gardner, entrepreneur in residence at Blockchain Capital and chairman of the board of the Blockchain Education Network, to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThus, this one specific ruling has a negligible impact on the industry long-term. However, either outcome will have a considerable immediate price impact and I think that has many Bitcoiners, myself included, on edge.\u201d\nShould the SEC surprise the market by approving the first-ever publicly listed bitcoin ETF, then bitcoin will most likely soon be added to many institutional investors\u2019 portfolios for the purpose of diversification next to other alternative asset classes, such as gold, silver and real estate.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 9}

Steptoe & Johnson will provide legal counsel to the coalition. \nCurrently, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) classifies digital currency holdings as property under Notice 2014-21, which was published in April 2014, but has not provided more detailed guidance on how digital currency and digital asset holdings should be appropriately taxed. \nIt is in response to this lack of clear taxation policies for digital assets that the Digital Asset Tax Policy Coalition, based in Washington, D.C., has been formed. \nPerianne Boring, president and founder of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, said in the press release: \u201cClear tax treatment for digital assets is essential to ensure robust growth of this important sector.\u201d \nJason Weinstein, a Steptoe partner and co-chair of the law firm\u2019s Blockchain and Digital Currency practice, believes that \u201ctax solutions that allow the IRS to do its job without resorting to actions such as a John Doe summons will be of benefit to all.\u201d \nThe John Doe summons that Weinstein is referring to was served by the IRS to the bitcoin wallet provider and digital currency exchange Coinbase Inc. in November 2016 to investigate digital currency transactions by U.S. taxpayers under the suspicion that taxpayers were hiding taxable income from the IRS. \n\nThe Digital Asset Tax Policy Coalition aims to address these types of digital currency taxation issues by proactively engaging with policymakers on issues of mutual concern. The formation of the coalition follows the creation of the Blockchain Alliance, which was also co-founded by the Chamber of Digital Commerce, to help combat criminal activity linked to digital currencies by acting as a resource to law enforcement and by providing an open forum for the private sector, law enforcement and regulators to discuss digital assets. \nWhile early bitcoin adopters, cypherpunks and \u201cbe your own bank\u201d idealists would prefer that the taxman stay out of their business, the reality is that if bitcoin wants to succeed both as a viable transactional currency and as an investment asset class, there needs to be clear guidance from the tax authorities on how digital currencies and digital assets need to be taxed.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nTumbleBit, one of the most promising privacy advancements built on top of Bitcoin, will be implemented in the upcoming Breeze Wallet.\nThe Breeze Wallet is a bitcoin wallet in development by blockchain startup Stratis, scheduled for release in one or two months. It will serve as a typical bitcoin wallet for desktop computers, but with an added tumbling option. Connected through a TumbleBit tumbler, Breeze Wallet users can mix their coins without needing to trust each other or the tumbler with their coins or their privacy.\n\u201cWe are integrating TumbleBit because it\u2019s a trustless and secure solution that works with Bitcoin without any forks,\u201d Stratis Founder and CEO Chris Trew told Bitcoin Magazine. \nStratis\nStratis is a U.K.-based startup that offers end-to-end solutions for development, testing and deployment of blockchain applications. The company will maintain its own blockchain (the Stratis blockchain), which includes a native token (the Stratis token). Additionally, the company builds tools for existing blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and BitShares. Stratis projects include a Bitcoin full node in the programming language C#, a Bitcoin software development kit and, indeed, the Breeze wallet, which will hold both bitcoins and the Stratis tokens.\nTumbleBit was first proposed by academic researchers Ethan Heilman, Leen AlShenibr, Foteini Baldimtsi, Alessandra Scafuro and Sharon Goldberg. Inspired by its potential, \u201cProgramming The Blockchain in C#\u201d author and Stratis team member Nicolas Dorier started working on an implementation of TumbleBit in C#. He was joined by the co-author of his book, Fics\u00f3r \u00c1d\u00e1m, who focused on Tor integration.\nNow, with the help of \u00c1d\u00e1m, Stratis is making the solution available in a convenient and easy-to-use wallet. It is a natural match not only because Stratis\u2019s and Dorier\u2019s implementations of TumbleBit share the same programming language, but also because Stratis has a strong focus on privacy on their own platform, Trew explained.\n\u201cRegulation is one of the main hurdles for blockchain [technology] and Bitcoin adoption among the financial services industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first step of regulatory compliance is privacy of their sensitive financial data. This is one of the reasons for the rise of the private chain and distributed ledger technologies. Our goal is to provide open and public blockchain solutions for the enterprise; to deliver this we must provide transaction privacy on a public blockchain.\u201d\nChallenges\nTo realize the privacy features it promises, Breeze Wallet will also introduce a relatively new type of light client. Based on work by Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli, the wallet will utilize \u201cFull Block Simplified Payment Verification,\u201d or \u201cFull Block SPV.\u201d\nFull nodes download and verify each block on the blockchain, which can be quite resource intensive. Most light clients therefore only download the specific data that\u2019s relevant to them: mostly relating to their Bitcoin addresses. But to do this, they need to share all their addresses with a server or a node on the Bitcoin network. \nThis server or node \u2014 and anyone spying on the communication with this server or node \u2014 learns all addresses that are in the wallet. This makes tumbling coins from one address in a wallet to another address in the same wallet rather pointless.\nInstead, \u00c1d\u00e1m is currently implementing a type of light client that will download full blocks but immediately discard any data it doesn\u2019t need. This requires the wallet to download more data than typical light clients, which is why Breeze Wallet won\u2019t be very suitable for mobile wallets anytime soon. But it will be less resource intensive than running a full node and, therefore, easier to use for regular users.\nLastly, one hurdle remains: someone, somewhere, needs to host the tumbler. While this can be done as a hidden service, the TumbleBit developers have been hesitant to do this themselves so far. Such a service may not exactly please regulators and anti-money laundering agencies.\nStratis is now working through the legal and regulatory issues involved with deploying a solution of this type. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to have a decentralized network of TumbleBit servers. We are working on delivering end-to-end solutions; then we will further develop some of the core components,\u201d Trew said.\nFor more on TumbleBit, read \u201cWith TumbleBit, Bitcoin Mixing May Have Found Its Winning Answer\u201d and \u201cBetter Bitcoin Privacy, Scalability: Developers Making TumbleBit a Reality.\u201d\n", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 10}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nOn day one of the 2017 MIT Bitcoin Expo, Sia Co-Founder David Vorick, who has contributed to Bitcoin Core, gave a presentation on the important role played by full nodes in digital currency networks. In his view, economically relevant full nodes are the ones that have \u201cvoting\u201d power (for lack of a better term) in attempted hard-forking changes to the rules of Bitcoin.\nWhat Is the Role of the Full Node?\nEarly in his talk, Vorick focused on the general role played by full nodes on the network. \u201cFull nodes validate transactions on the Bitcoin network,\u201d he stated. \u201cBitcoin has this longest-chain rule where the chain with the most work in it is the one that everybody follows, except this chain also has to follow all of the rules that the network has. The full nodes are the ones [that] check that the chain follows the rules, and if a chain doesn\u2019t follow the rules, it doesn\u2019t matter how much hashrate is behind it, that chain is ignored.\u201d\nAccording to Vorick, of all the different types of Bitcoin users, full nodes are the only ones that check that the rules are followed. Those who run an SPV node or use some sort of web wallet are putting their trust in others to verify that certain rules are being followed correctly on the most-work chain.\n\u201cThey\u2019re faster,\u201d Vorick said in terms of SPV nodes. \u201cThey download all the headers. They make sure that they are on the chain with the most work, but they don\u2019t actually check that the chain with the most work is legal or is valid.\u201d\nVorick went on to state that SPV nodes are essentially betting that the rest of the network will sufficiently handle the validation process for them.\n\u201cSPV nodes just blindly have faith in the broader network to do this process that makes sure that the longest chain is always valid,\u201d Vorick continued. \u201cThey don\u2019t actually know. They\u2019re just assuming that the broader network is going to keep them safe.\u201d\nWithout full nodes, Vorick says, miners are given the ability to do whatever they want. \u201cIf people can spend each other\u2019s money [or] if miners can [produce] money out of nowhere, you have a useless system,\u201d he added.\nUpgrades in Bitcoin\nVorick also talked about how upgrades are made to the Bitcoin network. When talking about upgrades, he was referring to hard forks specifically. He also referred to soft forks as patches.\n\u201cSoft forks don\u2019t actually change the rules; they just are more creative about how they use the rules,\u201d Vorick explained.\nIn terms of attempted hard forks, Vorick claimed there are three potential outcomes. In one, the hard fork could fail and everyone may decide to ignore the failed chain. Vorick pointed to the recent block larger than 1 million bytes accidentally mined by Bitcoin.com as an example of a failed upgrade.\nAnother possible outcome from an attempted hard fork is that economic activity continues to take place on both chains. Vorick referred to this as a \u201cpartially successful upgrade,\u201d and he used the split between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic as an example of this outcome.\nThe third possible outcome mentioned by Vorick is a successful hard fork with new rules where the new chain becomes the only chain people use and everyone ignores the old chain. Besides the hard fork that resulted in the split between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, the Ethereum chain has also had multiple successful hard forks.\nEconomically Relevant Full Nodes Have the Power\nWhen determining the level of success achieved by an attempted upgrade, Vorick claimed that it ultimately comes down to the desires of the full nodes. \u201cIf you\u2019re not running a full node, sort of your opinion on whether or not you like a hard fork is less relevant because, ultimately, if you\u2019re not validating the rules and someone gives you a transaction following a different rule set, you don\u2019t have a way to detect that,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo you can\u2019t actually weigh in on an attempted hard fork, an attempted upgrade.\u201d\nVorick then compared full nodes to representatives in a democracy; however, he also pointed out that some full nodes are much more economically relevant than others. BitPay, for example, has a bigger say in what happens than a full node sending and receiving one small payment per month.\nAccording to Vorick, users can be dragged along with miners and large businesses if the cost of running a full node is too high. \u201cIf full nodes are expensive to run, only people who are capable of running nodes really have any say in what happens in a contentious upgrade,\u201d he added.\nAs an example, Vorick pointed out that Ethereum Classic may not have ever existed if it cost too much for the original Ethereum chain\u2019s early supporters to run full nodes.\n\u201cI would advocate that, right now, full [Bitcoin] nodes are too expensive,\u201d Vorick concluded.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 9}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe COIN ETF is a no-go.\nAlmost four years in the making, in a highly anticipated verdict published earlier today, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected the the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust exchange traded fund (ETF). \nAn ETF is an investment fund that holds assets like stocks, commodities or bonds, and trades on stock exchanges. This ETF, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust intended to have been listed as COIN, would have let institutional investors invest in bitcoin, without actually needing to buy or hold the digital currency themselves; these would be held by a custodian, Gemini.\nIn its decision, the SEC singled out two major concerns regarding the application. First, the exchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated.\n\u201c[T]he Commission does not find that the proposed rule change is consistent with [\u2026] the Exchange Act\u2014which requires that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed, among other things, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest \u2014 because the Commission believes that the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated and that, therefore, the Exchange has not entered into, and would currently be unable to enter into, the type of surveillance-sharing agreement that helps address concerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices in the market for the Shares.\u201d\nGemini \u2014 the bitcoin exchange operated by the Winklevoss twins and proposed custodian for COIN \u2014 is properly regulated in New York state, but only accounts for relatively low trade volumes. Meanwhile the major bitcoin markets, the SEC notes, are currently located outside of US jurisdiction.\nImmediately following the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped sharply from some $1290 to $970 and is sitting around $1120 at time of publication. \nReactions\nUnsurprisingly, not everyone agrees with the verdict.\n\u201cThis creates a chicken-and-egg problem,\u201d Coin Center\u2019s Jerry Brito commented. \u201cHow do we develop well-capitalized and regulated markets in the U.S. and Europe if financial innovators aren\u2019t allowed to bring products to market that grow domestic demand for digital currencies like Bitcoin?\u201d\nIn spite of disappointment among many bitcoiners at the result, there are plenty in the community who are nonplussed by the news.\u00a0\n\n\nthe ETFs dont add to #bitcoin utility, they give passive investors an easier way to buy the future potential, though lacking bearer property\u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) March 10, 2017\n\n\n\n\nFor some, it was even viewed as an affirmation:\n\n\n\nThe ETF was denied because bitcoin can't be regulated, can't be surveilled. Feature, not bug.\u2014 Andreas (@aantonop) March 10, 2017\n\n\n\n\u201cThe disapproval does not change Bitcoin\u2019s compelling fundamental growth story,\u201d Spencer Bogart, Managing Director and Research Head at Blockchain Capital, said to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe always viewed the potential for the ETF as a low-probability event that would only accelerate and de-risk the trajectory that bitcoin has already been on over the past 8 years.\u201d\n\n\nWe choose to go to the Moon not because some \"authority\" approved the mission, but because they claimed we couldn't do it without them.\u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) March 10, 2017\n\n\n\nFuture Implications\nBesides COIN, two other bitcoin ETFs are still in the running: SolidX Bitcoin Trust and the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), sponsored by Barry Silbert\u2019s Grayscale Investments. SolidX Bitcoin Trust is due to be considered for approval by the SEC by the end of this month \u2014 BIT will take until the end of the year. \nHowever, given the motivation to reject the Winklevoss\u2019 ETF, Bogart considers it unlikely these two will have more luck with the SEC.\n\u201cThe grounds for the disapproval suggest that the other Bitcoin ETFs that are going through the approval process are also unlikely to be approved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was disapproved because the markets on which bitcoin primarily trades are largely unregulated and, as such, the SEC would be unable to enter into \u201csurveillance-sharing\u201d agreements that, among other things, help the Commission stomp out market manipulation.\u201d\nThe SEC itself, meanwhile, ended the order on a more positive note \u2014 at least for the long-term prospects of a Bitcoin ETF.\n\u201cThe Commission notes that bitcoin is still in the relatively early stages of its development and that, over time, regulated bitcoin-related markets of significant size may develop,\u201d the decision states. \u201cShould such markets develop, the Commission could consider whether a bitcoin ETP would, based on the facts and circumstances then presented, be consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 11}

Highlighting this was the blockchain hackathon event that took place in November of 2016 at Dublin City University. It attracted more than 150 technologists and fintech entrepreneurs, collaborating together on the creation of new apps and services using blockchain technology.\nLast year also saw Travacoin, an Irish startup, achieve acclaim for its work on a blockchain-based voucher system that facilitates a refund and compensation system for delayed and canceled flights. \nIn early 2017, global consulting firm Deloitte, which works with 90 percent of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions, launched their new EMEA blockchain lab in Dublin\u2019s \u201cSilicon Docks\u201d district. This fintech and innovation center joins a network of global labs that includes one on Wall Street in New York. Co-located with the likes of Google, Facebook and others, it is fueled by a team of over 40 blockchain developers and designers committed to cutting-edge advancement in the distributed technology space. In its brief existence Deloitte has already engaged in working partnerships with the Bank of Ireland and blockchain software developer ConsenSys.\nA signature project for Deloitte\u2019s blockchain lab involved a collaboration with a group of stakeholders that included Deutsche Bank, Metzler, Northern Trust, Irish Funds and State Street as participants. This use case involving blockchain technology to manage and oversee regulatory reporting resulted in a regulatory \u201cproof of concept\u201d reporting protocol that captures transactions and uses smart contracts capability to manage reporting, resulting in increased transparency and accountability.\nReuben Godfrey is the director of the Blockchain Association of Ireland, an organization headquartered in Dublin that aims to foster and coordinate Ireland\u2019s depth of talent, drive and enthusiasm to position the country globally as a thought leader on blockchain development. The goal is to achieve this through engagement with regulators, policymakers, educators, other not-for-profit organizations and technology entrepreneurs, all with the intent of guiding public dialogue around emerging blockchain trends in the country. \nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Godfrey said that a number of local and multinational companies have been producing good results on a number of collaborative projects. The fact that Deloitte chose Ireland as the landing spot for their EMEA Blockchain Hub, he notes, was was a huge vote of confidence for Ireland in terms of being recognized as a global blockchain player.\nA big issue at the moment in Ireland, said Godfrey, is the race to hire programmers who understand the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming evident that there simply aren\u2019t enough \u2018experts\u2019 to fill these roles. In the coming year to eighteen months, I foresee a growing need for cross-training of existing talent. In the meantime companies in this space will need to fundamentally rethink their current approaches. Those that fail to keep up may see their business model quickly outdated and face serious disruption from new startups.\u201d \u00a0\nGodfrey pointed out that the blockchain community in Ireland remains slightly fragmented. \u201cThere is still no guidance at a national level so it\u2019s up to us and other organizations, universities and the private sector to bring the conversation forward and elicit a stance from policymakers and regulators.\u201d\nIn terms of the long-term future for blockchain technology and bitcoin in Ireland, Godfrey concluded, \u201cI always answer the same way on this, namely, that it\u2019s like the internet was 25 years ago. We could have predicted the web\u2019s impact on, say, print media, but it would have been far harder to predict the social and political impact of the broader social media landscape of Twitter [and] Facebook.

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nContrary to popular media, Bitcoin does not need an ETF to remain relevant or to succeed. An ETF brings a large liquidity pool of money to the digital currency, but Bitcoin was never meant to be confined to rules and regulations. Unsurprisingly, SEC denial of the ETF was a large news event which allowed for easy selling pressure, down 25% on the day in an otherwise overbought market. Even without the ETF, Bitcoin gained large coverage on several news and media outlets that would not have otherwise covered digital currency \u2014 and there\u2019s no such thing as bad press.\nAfter any large price drop or spike, two things tend to happen. First, price attempts to retrace to 50% of the move. This is referred to as Dow Theory. It happens so frequently that many traders, use a buy low and sell at the 50% retracement strategy. Price convincingly broke the 50% retracement level just over 10 hours after the drop.\n\nSecond, depending if the price movement is in the direction of the overall trend, price tries to retrace the entire move. This is referred to as Filling The Gap. This occurs because after a large move, there is little to no immediate support or resistance preventing the price from returning to its previous position. Gap filling occurs more frequently when it is supported by an active trend, as is the case currently with the bullish Bitcoin trend.\n\nThere is also an active chart pattern on low timeframes, the bull flag, which has a probability of continuation over reversal. The predicted move can be measured from the bottom of the pole to the top of the pole, projected upward from the tip of the triangle. This yields a target of ~$1278, thus filling the gap and treating the SEC decision as though it never happened. \n\nRecently, Bitcoin\u2019s large price movements have been driven by things like PBoC announcements, but that certainly isn\u2019t always the case. One can argue whether or not fundamental events move price more than technical indications; however, it can be preferable to focus on the technical aspect because it is more predictable than say, a random PBoC announcement in the middle of the day. \nBitcoin continues to snake through gold parity, which is largely meaningless aside from an ideological standpoint. The gold vs. bitcoin debate will continue to play itself out in due time. \u00a0\n\nEven more interesting than the SEC decision was a price spike earlier Friday morning at 8:30AM EST, which coincided with the U.S. jobs report. In Forex, this is referred to as Nonfarm payroll (NFP). These scheduled news events are almost guaranteed to cause price volatility. During this period, Bitcoin also made a new all-time high of ~$1320 on index and $1350 on Bitstamp, which was overshadowed by the ETF announcement. \n\nBitcoin\u2019s reaction to NFP, which has occurred a few times in the past, gives evidence for Bitcoin being watched by legacy traders and algo bots. Whether Bitcoiners like it or not, the Bitcoin market will slowly begin to be increasingly influenced by external market forces and macro news events.\nSummary\n1. The SEC denial of the bitcoin ETF was a predictably bearish news event which dropped the price 25% in an already overbought market.\n2. Typically, after a large price movement has completed, the next two targets are the 50% and 100% retracement levels.\n3. Bitcoin has shown that even without regulatory oversight, it has begun to be incorporated into the fold of legacy traders and bots with reaction to news events like NFP.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

{"title": "Fusing Blockchain and IoT: An Interview With Filament\u2019s CEO", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/fusing-blockchain-and-iot-interview-filaments-ceo/", "birthday": "Mar 14, 2017  11:00 AM EST", "date": "2017-03-14 16:00:00", "content": "For Allison Clift-Jennings, her interest in blockchain technology was fueled by some research she was engaged in around three disciplines that have long intrigued her \u2014 philosophy, economics and technology. She first began printing out the various research papers and writings of people who were in a similar exploratory mode \u2014 people like David Chaum, Ryan Fugger and Ian Grigg \u2014 back in 2005.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI had this strange drive to try to unify \u2014 in my own head \u2014 these different disciplines and see if there was something that could come from it. I still have the binder of these early explorations, along with my own notes, and it\u2019s fun to revisit from time to time,\u201d said Clift-Jennings in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\n \nWith a degree in computer science from the University of Nevada, Reno, Clift-Jennings says her work over the years has been highly informed by systems theory: \u201cMy interest in this discipline is really a graduation of sorts, from the earlier work being done within the cryptocurrency, cypherpunk, counter-economic and distributed systems fields. Systems theory has served as a resolution to my mind\u2019s drive to unify all these different disciplines.\u201d\n \nNow, as the CEO of Filament, a company firmly entrenched within the Internet of Things (IoT) movement, her efforts focus on fusing and connecting legacy, industrial infrastructure with blockchain technology. She says that 70 percent of the existing machines and infrastructures running in various industrial verticals such as mining, oil and gas, manufacturing, aerospace and the like are all currently disconnected today. \u00a0\n\u201cFilament focuses on this infrastructure, to make it smart and connected. We provide a hardware and software platform that provides this functionality. And we utilize a pretty novel economic stack that allows devices to self-enforce their own contractual agreements between parties.\u201d\nContinues Clift-Jennings: \u201cSome call this an on-device, off-chain smart contract platform. I like that definition \u2014 though it\u2019s important to clarify that these contracts do not run in a blockchain \u2014 they merely verify inputs and outputs via a blockchain. \u00a0This protocol stack is called Blocklet.\u201d\n \nFilament is a platform to deliver the ubiquitous connectivity of Telehash with the economic \u201ctransact-ability\u201d of Blocklet directly to machines in the industrial IoT space. This is where things get interesting.\n \nBlockchain technology is in the early stages of playing a major role in IoT\u2019s advancement by boosting security and allowing myriad types of devices greater utility and ease in management. Tech firm IBM is one of a handful of companies at the forefront of this movement. For example, the IBM Watson IoT blockchain enables IoT devices to participate in transactions. By utilizing the Watson IoT Platform, it is now possible for device information such as that relayed through RFID-based locations, barcode-scan events or data device aggregators to be integrated with the IBM blockchain.\nThe alignment of blockchain technology and IoT is also allowing for advancements in terms of supply chain systems optimization, digital passports for proof of authenticity and origin, and auditable records. The effective curation of this information provides ease of sharing with regulatory agencies and insurers.\n \nBut perhaps the biggest value proposition for blockchain technology in this entire equation is security. \u201cIndeed, security used to be the fourth or fifth question prospective customers would ask us. Now it\u2019s the first or second \u2014 and for good reason,\u201d says Clift-Jennings.\n \nFor Filament, that means security and privacy for IoT devices absolutely must start at the hardware level. Clift-Jennings says that it is inexcusable in 2017 for hardware to be made without secure elements or cryptographic key storage chips in them. \u00a0\u201cThey are cheap, they are relatively secure and tamper-resistant. So there is no excuse not to include them.\u201d\n \nOnce you have a secure method to store keys, and sign and encrypt data, then you can begin to build upon that, she adds.\nFilament\u2019s approach is to start with a secure element on each device \u2014 with a whole host of keys that get burned into a write-once or one-time-programmable (OTP) memory. Then Filament builds contractual agreements based on the JOSE standard \u00a0before binding the capabilities of a device to these contractual parameters. Encrypting Filament\u2019s firmware and on-device system thus ensures privacy and security while data is at rest on the device.\nTelehash, an end-to-end encrypted P2P protocol, is the way the company secures and keeps private data in transit. Here, everything from device accessibility to firmware updating to on-device flash storage to even BLE packet communications and USB serial traffic is all encrypted, from end to end. \n \n\u201c[Telehash] really doesn\u2019t care what network medium one is using,\u201d Clift-Jennings notes. \u201cSo we can easily encrypt data coming off of a USB serial line (for instance, connected to a large manufacturing machine\u2019s diagnostic port) and transport that data \u2014 secure and private \u2014 to an endpoint that might be in the cloud.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nClift-Jennings says that the Telehash protocol is very good at minimizing, and in many situations eliminating, metadata, so that very little leakage of data occurs even when using encryption. This becomes very important, she asserts, for privacy concerns. As Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and CIA, has stated: people are killed based on metadata.\nLooking Ahead\nAccording to Clift-Jennings, these are the four most interesting areas to follow over the coming year or two:\n\"First, digital currency will not be going away. Bitcoin will find its way somehow \u2014 it may be SegWit, it may be Unlimited. But it will likely not be where it is today. This is a good thing.\n\"Second, the first permissioned blockchains \u2014 probably based on Hyperledger \u2014 will begin to deploy within particular industrial verticals. Perhaps the National Mining Association will have one for mining, the National Association of Manufacturing for manufacturing and so on. Why industrial-specific? Because they all have different needs and requirements, and none (to my knowledge at least) are interested in using Bitcoin or Ethereum\u2019s blockchain to distribute their trust.\n\"Third, another DAO will be attempted. This idea, while initially not a resounding success, is the right direction long-term. Giving birth to things is messy!\n\"Fourth, devices via the Internet of Things will become a new smart contract platform. I know this feels self-serving to Filament, but I just can\u2019t imagine that devices will be as ubiquitous and powerful and voluminous as we expect, and we will be requiring all of them to run their contracts in a blockchain in the cloud. That doesn\u2019t scale, it\u2019s not performant and isn\u2019t necessary. Devices only need blockchains to verify, not to execute.\"\nClift-Jennings says she\u2019s also very excited for lightning network\u2019s payment channels, as well as the early work being done to try to bring a fair payment/royalty framework to creative works \u2014 though she laments that it seems like a very, very hard problem to solve. \u201cBut if I were a pessimist, I certainly wouldn\u2019t be in this industry!\n\u201cMy hope for Filament for 2017 is that we will be able to talk about and \u2014 more important \u2014 show examples of our platform doing the things we describe, at scale, for customers. \n\u201cAnd as far as our long-term vision, it\u2019s my hope that Filament\u2019s platform \u2014 and others like it \u2014 will enable entire new ways of building and sustaining industry. So much of it we take for granted today, but if \u2014 through automation and attestation \u2014 we can cut industrial costs down significantly and make them more efficient, we will output less waste, will scale better, and we drive toward a future I think we will all prefer.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 14}
{"title": "Bitcoin is Now Useless for Micropayments, But Solutions are Coming", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-now-useless-micropayments-solutions-are-coming1/", "birthday": "Mar 14, 2017  1:22 PM EST", "date": "2017-03-14 18:22:00", "content": "Kyle Torpey is a freelance writer and researcher who has been following Bitcoin since 2011. His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is basically becoming useless for low-value, instant purchases. Frankly, if you\u2019re ordering a beer at a bar, you\u2019re better off using cash or a credit card at this point.\nBitcoin was once touted as a cheaper alternative to credit cards that was going to revolutionize the payments industry, but the P2P digital cash system has hit a bit of a speed bump in terms of those long-promised \u201cfree\u201d transactions. Let\u2019s take a closer look at Bitcoin\u2019s increased transaction fees and what solutions exist to solve this issue.\nWhat\u2019s Wrong With Small Payments on Bitcoin?\nThe problem with low-value transactions on the Bitcoin network right now is that fees are too high for it to be of any practical use in these situations. 21\u2019s bitcoin fee estimator recommends a fee of 54,240 satoshis at the time of this writing, which equates to roughly $0.69. This cost is roughly double the amount of fees involved in many low-value credit card transactions.\nIn fact, as a user on Reddit pointed out, more than half of the Bitcoin addresses in existence contain a balance lower than the current estimated transaction fee. However, the balances of these addresses amount to roughly 0.00001% of all bitcoins in existence.\nWhile the level of censorship resistance offered by Bitcoin\u2019s permissionless payment network has obvious value, it\u2019s also rather expensive. The system must remain decentralized in order for this resistance to censorship to remain intact. The cost of operating a full node increases as more transactions are processed on the network, and some users already see the costs related to full node operation as too high.\nThe reason that this sort of change has not yet been implemented is that coming to consensus on a proper solution for this sort of issue in a decentralized fashion has proven to be difficult. It is both a positive and a negative that Bitcoin is resistant to these sorts of changes.\nBitcoin payments were much cheaper in the past because demand for block space was much lower. Users are now essentially bidding on the right to have their transactions included in the next block. Large-value transfers and payments that necessitate a certain degree of censorship resistance will tend to outbid lower-value, everyday payments such as the purchase of a cup of coffee.\nHow Could Smaller Payments Work on Bitcoin Right Now?\nFor now, smaller-value payments with bitcoin tend to require a degree of trust in another party, which is ironic because removing that third party was outlined in the original Bitcoin white paper as a reason for Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s creation. If you\u2019re going to avoid an on-chain transaction fee with your bitcoin payments, then you\u2019ll likely be holding your coins in a bitcoin bank, such as Coinbase or Xapo, with the receiver of your payment also having an account at that particular bitcoin bank.\nThe level of trust in the bitcoin bank can already be mitigated a bit by using something like Blockstream\u2019s Liquid or an Open Transactions voting pool. In these sorts of schemes, funds are held in one giant multisignature address by all of the banks involved in the program. An individual bitcoin bank would not be able to steal customer funds, but customers must still trust that a majority of banks (depending on the setup) do not collude to steal funds from the now much-bigger pot.\nSystems like Liquid and voting pools also have the side effect of not requiring an on-chain transaction for the transfer of funds between the participating entities and their customers.\nNo bitcoin bank or exchange has publicly announced that they are using one of these systems at this time.\nAlternatively, bitcoin banks could decide to make agreements with each other to settle transactions between their customers once per day. This would essentially mean that payments between customers at Coinbase, Xapo and any other centralized bitcoin bank or exchange would happen off-chain at little or no cost.\nHow Could These Systems Improve in the Future?\nIn the spirit of Bitcoin, the level of trust required in these centralized entities can also be reduced through further improvements at the base protocol level. Solutions such as the lightning network and TumbleBit drastically reduce the amount of trust required in one of these centralized institutions to the point where it would probably be incorrect to refer to them as banks at all.\nIn TumbleBit, for example, the \u201cbank\u201d is unable to steal customer funds and does not know where user funds are being sent. TumbleBit also provides better privacy and essentially instant quasi-settlement of bitcoin transactions.\nLess useful and elegant versions of the lightning network and TumbleBit are possible with the current version of Bitcoin, but they would be greatly enhanced if Segregated Witness were activated on the Bitcoin network. Content sharing and monetization platform Yours intends to launch with a payment solution similar to the lightning network that acts as more of a hub-and-spoke system rather than a generalized layer for these types of payments.\nIn a situation where these layer-two protocols are implemented and widely used, bitcoin users would essentially have two sets of bitcoins in their wallets that come with different levels of security. The bitcoins that are unconnected to the lightning network or a TumbleBit hub would be like money in a savings account, while the coins \u201ctied up\u201d (for lack of a better term) on these layer-two systems would be similar to money in a checking account.\nThen again, this structure would not be too dissimilar to how things work today. Many bitcoin users already keep their bitcoin savings in some form of cold storage while their spending money is in a mobile wallet. The specifics of how this would play out are somewhat unclear at this time.\nAn increase in the block size limit via a hard fork would also create an increase in the supply of block space, and thus lower the cost of on-chain transactions overall, but it\u2019s unclear how large blocks can become while retaining a sufficient level of decentralization and censorship resistance. A key difference with the aforementioned solutions is that they potentially increase the level of risk involved with a user\u2019s funds on an opt-in basis. With hard-forking changes being made at the protocol level, users are forced to opt into new risks by default.\nThis is not to say that a hard-forking increase to Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit cannot be made; it just needs to be balanced with the tradeoffs made when it comes to the cost of operating a full node. Past research has indicated that an increase from 1 MB to 4 MB may be worth it, but new research in this area would be useful.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 14}
{"title": "Op Ed: A Closer Look Into DASH (Part 1)", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-closer-look-dash-part-1/", "birthday": "Mar 14, 2017  3:17 PM EST", "date": "2017-03-14 20:17:00", "content": "Ace is an experienced investor and analyst for Bitcoin and other digital currencies/assets. Ace has a keen interest in emerging technology and is a firm believer in the positive impact that Bitcoin and other applications of blockchain technology will have on the world. Follow him on Twitter: @AceofWallStreet.\n\n\n\nDigital Cash (DASH) is a proof of work digital currency with self-governance and self-funding capabilities through the use of masternodes (MNs).\nThe main announcement can be found here and the website can be found here.\nDASH has the following block-reward structure:\n\n- 45 percent of block rewards for DASH go to miners- 45 percent goes toward MNs- 10 percent goes toward the Decentralized Governance Budget\n\nIn order to set up a masternode, 1000 DASH is required as collateral. MNs help to secure the DASH network and allow for DASH users to send private transactions through PrivateSend (a form of coin mixing). MNs are also able to vote on how the Decentralized Governance Budget is used.\nThere are currently ~4000 active MNs, which is the equivalent of ~4,000,000 DASH.\n\nTaken from dash.org\nDASH appears to be transitioning away from its initial focus on privacy toward focus on converting users through incentives and a seamless user experience.\n. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nTaken from Dash\n \nPotential Risk Factors\nBefore re-branding to Digital Cash, DASH was launched as XCoin and then shortly later re-branded to Darkcoin (DRK) due to its focus on anonymity.\nDuring the initial launch, the XCoin blockchain got stuck and a relaunch was scheduled. Although Darkcoin was launched with no premine, there was a massive instamine of nearly 2 million DRK within the first day. With a current supply of ~7,100,000 DASH, this means that 28 percent of all DASH currently in existence was mined in a single day.\n\nTaken from Dashdot\nThis presents obvious concerns:\n- High possibility that DASH supply is heavily centralized due to the instamine;\n- Due to MNs earning 45 percent of block rewards, centralization of supply is only more likely to have increased;\n- If MNs are heavily centralized, DASH\u2019s alleged privacy features are at the mercy of whoever is operating the majority of MNs.\n\nExample scenario of increased supply centralization through MNs from user PoS\nThere is no way to verify or guarantee that each masternode is operated by a unique individual, making the DASH masternode system highly susceptible to forms of Sybil attack.\nAfter the instamine, DRK block emission was lowered from 500 DRK to 5 DRK and maximum supply was reduced from 80m to 20m.\nAlthough centralization of supply does present risks, there are some resulting benefits in regard to price. Nearly 4000 MNs are active, which means the majority of the current DASH supply is \u201clocked up,\u201d resulting in lower amounts of DASH being available for exchange. This would allow DASH to have a more \u201cinflated\u201d valuation per coin.\nA sudden decrease in active MNs could signal a possible end to the recent increase in value that DASH has seen.\nInput Output HK has also shared concerns and suggestions regarding DASH.\nThe DASH Evolution Update\nEvolution aims to make digital cash easy to use and accessible for all users, even those who aren\u2019t technologically savvy. Anybody will be able to set up an account on the blockchain, add contacts and pay them by name. Purchases from websites or mobile apps will be simple, requiring only a single click.\nOverall, the DASH development team has done an excellent job at improving DASH\u2019s infrastructure and responsibly using funds. Now DASH is attempting to tackle the problem of user adoption by offering a faster, easier, more secure service with incentives in order to make DASH as consumer and merchant friendly as possible. Although DASH has an efficient governance model and funding model, which Bitcoin lacks, whether DASH will manage to establish a significant user base remains to be seen.\nThis guest post, originally published here, is by Ace.

{"title": "Op Ed: How the Blockchain Will Help Fix the Internet", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-how-blockchain-will-help-fix-internet/", "birthday": "Mar 14, 2017  2:28 PM EST", "date": "2017-03-14 19:28:00", "content": "Taylor Gerring is a Blockchain Consulting Expert and creator of \"Blockchain WTF.\" After working on the Hive digital currency wallet, Taylor served on the Board of Directors for the Ethereum Foundation and is currently an international speaker and educator, focusing on how blockchain can improve governance and society.\nA couple weeks ago, AWS (Amazon Web Services) experienced a failure that impacted a large swath of popular services that we increasingly depend on to manage our digital lives. Consider the online collaboration service Slack; many people belong to several Slacks channels. When Slack promises instant archival and recall of important information, but depends on Amazon for storing these attachments, these expectations are shattered when the fragile underlying infrastructure is compromised.\nAnd while \u201ccloud\u201d services like Amazon, Azure and Google offer fixes to the problems of scaling for millions of users, several other important problems remain unaddressed, especially as we transition to an age where even the lowly web browser is capable of video calls via peer-to-peer technology. \nThis is a concept Skype first introduced to the internet before their eventual purchase by tech giant Microsoft. Today, Skype is much more centralized and thus vulnerable as a target to would-be attackers. The original vision of Skype is not dead; rather, it is no longer restricted to the desktop. Instead, it can exist purely on the web.\nTechnological decentralization is beneficial for a variety of reasons based on resiliency. Beyond simply having more servers to interact with should some go down, having geographical diversity is important for the purposes of free speech. If the future is to be driven by partially connected devices then we should not expect bigger and fatter cellular towers to support these devices, but rather the devices should begin communicating with themselves and sharing information in a spread-out mesh. \nWhat if you traveled to a new country and instead of buying a SIM card, your phone could just ask nearby phones to relay a few KB of data for a fraction of a penny? This would lead to a much more fluid interaction (happening in the background) and lead to a world where everyone is a buyer/seller of data, not just the telecom and internet providers.\nSo far, all signs point to the magic of what we call \u201cblockchain technology.\u201d Problems with the spread of information are directly addressed by the peer-to-peer protocols that underlie Bitcoin, Ethereum and others. Problems with synchronization speak directly to the timestamping that blockchains provide, giving us a shared source of state. And thanks to Satoshi Nakamoto and countless other blockchain developers, we know that virtual tokens empower us each with native value transfer.\nIndeed these technologies have been highlighted in alternative projects like Namecoin and Bitmessage. In the case of the former, the idea of using a blockchain for name resolution was brought to fruition. And while the project lives on, it lacks the user and developer following sufficient to sustain a separate blockchain requiring separate security. Merge-mining the native coin for this blockchain lends some of Bitcoin\u2019s superior security to Namecoin, but then it continues to suffer the problem of portability: Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have any way to take advantage of Namecoin or vice versa. Essentially, a separate overlay protocol or bridge would be necessary to maintain.\nIf this sounds complex and convoluted, it is \u2014 even for technologists like myself. And this is a key reason that platforms like Ethereum have come to life. Borrowing from Bitcoin and other innovations, Ethereum allows for an integrated app-like experience that is as decentralized as its underlying blockchain. Governance of the protocol becomes a separate issue at this stage and appears to be a continually evolving topic of debate. \nKeen eyes have been watching the Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dash communities and drawing informed conclusions as to what the future might hold, given how these different communities govern themselves. But at its core, Ethereum\u2019s target users are developers wanting a more robust framework than Blockchain 1.0.\nThinking back to the early days of digital currencies before \u201capp platform on blockchain\u201d was a prevalent concept, I think it was clear that a series of protocols could be integrated into a digital wallet to allow for basic address book functionality, something common to even the earliest of electronic devices. \nWhat if we took the idea a step further and allowed users to message each other? What if those messages contained an attachment of BTC? Wendell Davis, the visionary behind Hive (an early digital currency wallet), saw these possibilities and set out to build an experience that we could be proud to show Mom and Dad. It was during my time working on this project that I started to understand some of the fundamental UI and UX problems our community has, the fixing of which would be a requisite for global adoption.\nSome of these problems are getting easier to solve due to complementary infrastructure being built up and around Bitcoin. But really, we haven\u2019t even yet begun to scratch the surface of integrating blockchains into the fabric of the internet. Yes, we can use blockchains for money \u2014 that much is clear. But there are many other applications of the state-tracking and information delivery system of blockchain technology that can benefit other critical parts of the internet. \nIt begins with an alternative for the Domain Name System (DNS). Although Namecoin was a great first experiment, the benefits of an integrated system like Ethereum are also becoming more clear. The Ethereum Name Service just launched, which can both replace how DNS works and integrate along with it. This approach \u2014 to be innovative but plug into existing infrastructure \u2014 will be critical to begin baking blockchain technology into the bones of the internet.\nSoon, we can expect to see decentralized apps being deployed in a variety of locations, from the app stores (centralized) to the traditional web (somewhat decentralized) to IPFS or Swarm (more decentralized). Already, at least two Ethereum-based mobile apps are in development: uPort for identity and Status.im as a chat and dapp client. Add to that the handful of games and betting sites on the web, plus browser integrations like Mist and Metamask, and already we see emergent behavior that is likely indicative of the future. \nNeed further proof? The alternative browser Brave already integrates Bitcoin. As these core pieces move into place, better and better dapps will be expected to build upon their predecessors, just as iPhone games today are better than the original crop in 2009. So too will dapps down the road be able to give us an improved version of Skype or Slack, but it will happen natively in our browsers.\nSo what will it take for blockchain technology to help fix the internet? The answer is devilishly simple: Just use it. Download some dapps, get some digital currency and participate in this new economy. Play some games, help organize community projects, or participate in rigorous discussion that will unfold on these new decentralized platforms.\nIf we cease to make use of those old and outdated protocols, and instead opt for open-source technology that encourages free speech and enhances the privacy of its users, half the battle is already won. When we show the world there is not only a demand for decentralized apps, but ones which allow us to maintain control of our own digital identities and rights, we can expect a new wave of developers to flock to \u201cblockchain technology\u201d to cash in on this new app rush.\nWho will the beneficiaries be? Content creators will get a bigger slice of the consumer pie, and consumers will be able to more selectively pay for content or opt out of ads without forking over a large percentage of the funds to a vague publishing entity. If you\u2019re a writer, musician, illustrator, videographer or one else that can produce works digitally, you stand to benefit hugely from a new smart contract economy where rights are tracked and fees instantly remitted. \nPeople who send money to family and friends will have access to faster and cheaper services that operate around the clock, thanks to the resiliency of Bitcoin. And if we don\u2019t screw up too much, just maybe we can begin to integrate this newfangled blockchain technology into the underlying infrastructure of the web.\nThis guest post was contributed by Taylor Gerring.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nFor over a year, attackers have had the ability to crash Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic nodes. Yesterday, someone actually did it. According to websites like Coin Dance, the number of Bitcoin Unlimited nodes fell sharply from almost 800 to less than 250 in a matter of hours. Bitcoin Classic was hit shortly after.\nOne day earlier, the security researcher who found the vulnerability had reached out to Bitcoin Magazine.\n\u201cI am quite beside myself at how a project that aims to power a $20 billion network can make beginner\u2019s mistakes like this.\u201d\nThe Vulnerabilities\nBitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic are forks of Bitcoin Core that intend to increase Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit. Both launched in 2015 and have been maintained by their own development teams since. While Bitcoin Classic was a relatively popular alternative to Bitcoin Core last year, Bitcoin Unlimited has been gaining traction lately. The world\u2019s largest mining pool \u2014 AntPool \u2014 announced it would switch to Bitcoin Unlimited, as have several smaller pools.\nBut not everyone believes that is a good idea.\n\u201cI am rather dismayed at the poor level of code quality in Bitcoin Unlimited and I suspect there [is] a raft of other issues,\u201d a security researcher identifying herself only as \u201cCharlotte Gardner\u201d told Bitcoin Magazine on Monday. \nCommunicating over email, Gardner said she was auditing the software for her own use, but quickly came to the conclusion that it\u2019s highly unsafe: \u201cWhat concerns me is that this software is now being used by a huge portion of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.\u201d\nGardner revealed that she had submitted two vulnerabilities \u2014 \u201ccritical remote crash vulnerabilities\u201d to be exact \u2014 to the Bitcoin Unlimited development team.\nThe first one is known as a \u201cNULL pointer dereference,\u201d the second a \u201creachable assertion.\u201d In both cases, attackers can send especially crafted messages to Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic nodes to make these nodes crash. On an open peer-to-peer network like Bitcoin\u2019s, this means that an attacker can get a list of Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic nodes from publicly available sources, like Bitnodes, and simply knock every single one of them offline.\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised no one has noticed them yet,\u201d Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine one day before the attack took place. \u201cI guess not many people actually use the Bitcoin Unlimited software. But with their \u2018rise,\u2019 attackers may take more interest.\u201d\nThe Disclosure\nWhen contacting Bitcoin Magazine on Monday, Gardner did not immediately want to make the vulnerabilities public. That would have been irresponsible, she explained, as the bugs could still be exploited before the Bitcoin Unlimited development team had the chance to fix it.\nBut she did also submit the vulnerabilities to Mitre\u2019s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. This ensures that Mitre discloses the bugs in one month from now, which pressures the developers to actually fix the problem in time.\nHowever, even following this responsible disclosure, Gardner thought there was a risk that the vulnerabilities would be abused as soon as they were fixed in the Bitcoin Unlimited code repository. After all, at that point the problem isn\u2019t really solved: anyone running the released Bitcoin Unlimited software is still vulnerable until they download and run the new, revised version. This opens a window for attackers.\n\u201cThe problem is, the bugs are so glaringly obvious that when fixing it, it will be easy to notice for anyone watching their development process,\u201d she said.\nIt now appears that is exactly what has happened. While the Bitcoin Unlimited developers did indeed fix the issue shortly after it was pointed out to them, they did so with far too conspicuous a GitHub commit message, Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine once it appeared the bugs seemed fixed and before the attacks began.\n\u201cTheir commit message does ring alarm bells. I\u2019m not sure if anyone will notice, but they probably should have obfuscated the message a bit more. The wording might attract closer scrutiny. But if it went unnoticed for this long, maybe it will go unnoticed.\u201d\nClearly, it did not.\nAs Gardner warned, it didn\u2019t take long for attackers to exploit one of the vulnerabilities: the first attacks happened shortly after the bugs were fixed. A little later, user \u201cshinobimonkey\u201d took the issue to Reddit, Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd tweeted about the bug and social media blew up. \nSomeone then even published exploit code for anyone to use, and before long most Bitcoin Unlimited nodes were down, to be followed by many Bitcoin Classic nodes. \n\u201cThis is exactly why there is supposed to be a \u2018responsible disclosure\u2019 protocol,\u201d Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine after the attacks took place. \u201cBut then it doesn\u2019t help if the software project is not discreet about fixing critical issues like this.\u201d\nCode Quality\nThis is not the first time the code quality of Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic has been scrutinized.\nAs the best-known example, the bitcoin.com mining pool, which runs Bitcoin Unlimited, mined an invalid block caused by a bug last January. All energy invested to produce the block was wasted, while mining pools that spy mined on top of the invalid block wasted some energy as well.\nBefore that, Bitcoin Core developers had already warned about buggy code on several occasions. On the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Matt Corallo said that he had found Bitcoin Classic\u2019s flexible transactions codebase to be \u201criddled with blatant and massive security holes.\u201d On Reddit, Gregory Maxwell pointed out that Bitcoin Unlimited nodes were crashing because the development team removed code that shouldn\u2019t have been removed.\nAddressing Bitcoin Unlimited lead developer Andrew Stone in response to yesterday\u2019s events, Maxwell suggested there are more problems with Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s codebase that have not yet been abused:\n\u201cThere are vulnerabilities in Unlimited which have been privately reported to you in Unlimited by Bitcoin Core folks which you have not acted on, sadly. More severe than this one, in fact.\u201d\nPerhaps the main problem for Bitcoin Unlimited, as pointed out by information security expert Andreas Antonopoulos, is that it lacks a significant development community to perform proper quality analysis. The number of developers working on Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic is relatively small, and the code that included the exploited vulnerability was merged after being reviewed by only one person \u2014 not a lot for security-critical code protecting people\u2019s money.\nGardner agreed with this assessment:\u201cIn this case, the vulnerabilities are so glaringly obvious, it is clear no one has audited their code because these stick out like a sore thumb,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m astounded the mining industry are running this software. But since they are, and a lot of people could get harmed, the best I can do, other than recommending they don\u2019t use Bitcoin Unlimited, is to disclose the issues and hope they are competent enough to fix it.\u201d\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitcoin Unlimited developers Andrew Stone and Andrea Suisani, but received no response at time of publication.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 15}

Ace has a keen interest in emerging technology and is a firm believer in the positive impact that Bitcoin and other applications of blockchain technology will have on the world. Follow him on Twitter: @AceofWallStreet.\n\n\n\nPart one\u00a0of this two-part series covered an introduction to and overview of DASH.\u00a0\nOn March 29, 2014, Evan Duffield posted \u201cthe story of how Darkcoin came about\u201d in hopes of providing clarification after controversy over the initial \u201cinstamine\u201d of Darkcoin \u2026\n\n\nTaken from Dash forums\nThere was an error after initial launch, so a relaunch was announced. It is safe to assume that Duffield was mining without problems from the very start since he was able to offer a significantly large bounty of 5000 coins (with maximum block rewards being 500) for a Windows OS wallet within hours of launch. It is also hard to believe that one would have been unaware of the high emissions while actively mining it. If emissions weren\u2019t high, where were all the coins coming from?\n\nTaken from bitcointalk.org\nIP analysis shows that among the 124 initial \u201cminers\u201d for Darkcoin:\n- 106 were Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure cloud instances\n- 9 were other cloud hosting and dedicated servers\n- 9 were private users\n\nIP analysis by user othe\nIt is important to note that it is very easy for one person to set up multiple Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure cloud instances. It is possible that one to five people could have been responsible for all 106 Amazon and Microsoft instances.\nShortly after the relaunch, people became aware that the emission for Darkcoin was significantly higher than originally stated. Based on Duffield\u2019s belief that a completely fair start is a \u201crequirement to create a healthy ecosystem,\u201d it would be reasonable to consider this a big enough error to relaunch once again.\nHowever, there was no relaunch despite the evident issues resulting from the massive instamine that created almost 2 million Darkcoin on the first day. The only potential benefit of an instamine is enriching whoever managed to partake in it. Although he states that they \u201cdidn\u2019t even have a block explorer yet\u201d it is possible to obtain information about coin supply without a block explorer. \n\nTaken from bitcoin dev. reference\nDuffield wrote: \u201cRight after block 4500 is when I started working on DarkSend. I was trying to create a proof-of-concept and eventually I succeeded, I posted about it and the coin started to become more popular by the day. This is when the coin became a serious project of mine.\u201d\nAlthough Duffield claims that he began working on DarkSend after block 4500 and that Darkcoin became a serious project only after it continued to grow, this email sent on December 29, 2013, before Darkcoin was ever launched (January 2014), seems to indicate otherwise:\n\nTaken from mail-archive\nNotice the phrase \u201chelp with a for-profit startup.\u201d\nGiven the nature of digital currency, the only way you can profit is typically through ownership of the coin (unless you ICO, crowdfund, etc.). This would mean that the only way Duffield and his team could potentially profit through Darkcoin would have been through ownership of it. This is suggestive and motive enough to continuously accumulate and maintain control over supply.\nDuffield also wrote, \u201c[T]he project will be a merge-mined altcoin that will provide a very useful service to the whole crypto-coin ecosystem\u201d and \u201cWe have detailed plans on how to implement it.\u201d\nThese phrases taken from the email further suggest that this project was planned and had a clear sense of direction before the coin was launched.\nWhy Is This a Problem?\nGiven that DASH is supposed to be a decentralized digital currency, there are obvious centralization concerns:\n- Any services provided by masternodes (MNs) may be at risk if masternode ownership is centralized, especially privacy/anonymity features.\n- Is a governance process even necessary if the majority of votes is potentially under the control of one entity?\n- The success of DASH is highly centralized around a very small group of developers.\n- Is DASH truly a decentralized digital currency?\nI have done analysis using the DASH coin emission schedule as reference to show the increasing rate of masternode and supply centralization.\n\nAlthough there are no immediate dangers from the potential centralization concerns, if DASH continues to rise in valuation, these concerns will serve as an Achilles\u2019 heel to DASH.\nFor more information and discussion regarding DASH, it is recommended that you view this video from @ToneVays and @FluffyPonyza\n\nThanks to user dnale0r for compiling much of this information in a very accessible manner and to Tone Vays and Riccardo Spagni for their discussions and helping to raise awareness about DASH\u2019s origins.\nThis guest post, originally published\u00a0here, is by Ace.

The survey shows that German bankers believe that blockchains will play an important role in the financial services industry in the future. However, only a small percentage of banks are currently actively implementing the technology as part of their overall business strategies.\nAccording to the study, a surprising 68% of the surveyed senior banking executives have little to no technical understanding of blockchain technology. Nonetheless, 63% believe that blockchains will impact banking business models within the next ten years. On the other hand, only 25% of the surveyed executives see blockchains having an impact on their business models within the next two years.\nCurrently, at 75%of German banks, blockchain technology is not a part of their strategic outlooks. This is made clear by the fact that 58% of German financial institutions currently do not employ staff that focus on developing solutions using distributed ledger technology, and that 72% of banks currently do not have budgets for developing such solutions. According to the survey, only 2% of German banks are significantly investing in blockchain technology to improve their businesses.\nIT security, data integrity and auditing purposes are areas that the surveyed banking executives consider to be most likely for implementation of distributed ledger technology. In areas such as securities trading and settlements and peer-to-peer payments, German banking executives forecast a lower chance of blockchain implementation in the near future.\nPerhaps the most interesting takeaway from the survey is that the majority of German banking executives do not see the need to implement blockchain technology into their business models in the near term: 39% of banks do not intend to engage in any blockchain projects in 2017, while 27% are still undecided about whether they will start blockchain initiatives this year; 25% stated that they would start to implement blockchain into their business strategy once the majority of other banks have done so; and only 13% of banks intend to be among the first to implement blockchain technology.\nThe survey also highlights that smaller German banks are more keen on blockchain technology implementation than their larger and more established counterparts. Banks with balance sheets under \u20ac1 billion have been spending a year longer on average researching blockchain solutions for their businesses than their competitors with balance sheets larger than \u20ac1 billion. In fact, it is the smaller banks in Germany that are embracing this new technology while larger banks are taking a more wait-and-see approach when it comes to blockchains.\nThe results of this survey are somewhat symptomatic of the fact that the financial industry is regularly discussing blockchain technology and running trials to test its use, but hardly any financial institutions are actually implementing live blockchains into their businesses yet.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 1}

Through the trial, Scotiabank sought to explore and evaluate how the AlphaPoint Distributed Ledger Platform could be leveraged internally across a range of use cases.\n \nWhen asked if AlphaPoint and Scotiabank were planning to further develop this project, Igor Telyatnikov, president and COO of AlphaPoint, told Bitcoin Magazine that he could not comment specifically on the next steps in the Scotiabank\u2013AlphaPoint collaboration. He did however indicate that AlphaPoint is planning to reveal some additional news in the near future.\n \n\u201cWe have two other major announcements that will be announced in the coming month, including a production launch with a systemically important financial institution,\u201d said Telyatnikov. \u201c2017 is shaping up to be an incredible year for the distributed ledger technology industry as a whole and for AlphaPoint as well.\u201d\n \nAs part of the multi-month project, trade reports were submitted upon deployment of the AlphaPoint Distributed Ledger Platform, which ran simultaneously on Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud and AlphaPoint hardware.\n \nIn real-time, the blockchain network converted FIXML messages to smart contracts and created an immutable \u201csingle truth\u201d across the entire network.\n \nThe Financial Information eXchange (FIX) is an industry protocol used for communicating securities information in specific electronic messages. This includes information such as getting quotes, market data and trade orders.\n \nWith trillions of dollars traded annually on the Nasdaq alone, financial services entities are investing heavily in optimizing electronic trading to increase their speed in financial markets and reduce costs.

Jared Polis (D-Colo.) and David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) officially launched the Congressional Blockchain Caucus in early February. First announced in September of 2016, this bipartisan working group will target the policy advancement of blockchain-oriented technologies and digital currencies.\nIn an official statement, Polis expressed his optimism about this next step for the caucus: \n\u201cBlockchain [technology] has the potential to transform the 21st century economy,\u201d Polis said. \u201cLawmakers need to understand that as the world rapidly changes, it\u2019s our responsibility to ensure that we craft policies and adapt laws that match our ingenuity. Blockchain [technology]\u2019s potential to reshape everything from the financial industry, to supply chains, to cybersecurity, to healthcare is something we should embrace. I look forward to the caucus\u2019s upcoming policy briefings and meetings that will educate members of Congress on these innovative technologies.\u201d\nRep. Schweikert furthered those sentiments. \u201cOpen blockchain networks and distributed ledger technologies are still new, but it\u2019s critical for members of Congress to begin comprehending both their current applications and future use cases. It is critically important the United States remain competitive regarding emerging technologies, and distributed ledger technology is the open, secure, efficient technology backbone we\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d \nThe primary aim of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus is to educate, engage and offer research to assist policymakers in pursuing thoughtful regulatory approaches to the issues facing the rapidly growing blockchain network landscape. \nPolis\u2019s cohort Schweikert replaced former Co-Chair of the Blockchain Caucus, Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R\u2013South Carolina), who was successfully confirmed as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s budget director after a tight, heated vote. \nRep. Mulvaney is widely seen as pro-Bitcoin and a major blockchain advocate. There is growing belief that his appointment will fuel the integration of blockchain technology into the U.S. government, even allowing Bitcoin to find a safe legal haven against onerous federal regulations. \nAn Outside-the-Beltway Perspective\nSteven J. Ehrlich, associate at the New York\u2013based Spitzberg Partners LLC, offered his insights to Bitcoin Magazine on the new caucus and the future of blockchain technology in government. Spitzberg Partners is a consultancy that assists clients in development, market entry and M&A strategies for Europe, North America and beyond.\n\u201cI applaud the launch of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus and am happy to see that the issue will continue moving forward following the ascension of former Co-Chair Mick Mulvaney, with Rep. David Schweikert taking his place,\u201d said Ehrlich. \nEhrlich believes that having a formal mechanism to discuss the potential use cases and public policy implications of this technology is critical to achieving more mainstream diffusion of this information. \nHe says that it will become harder to argue that this technology is strictly a law-enforcement issue or is exclusively useful for illicit activities if there is a dedicated group in Washington centered on promoting its use.\n\u201cI think that the U.S. continues to face challenges regulating the industry and the outlook is uncertain. Moreover I believe it\u2019s too early to make any broad assessments on what the impact of President Trump will be, but my initial outlook \u2014 although Mulvaney could temper it \u2014 is somewhat negative. Given his strong focus on security I see it as unlikely that he would give the benefit of the doubt to any technology, including virtual currencies, which has a whiff of impropriety.\u201d\nFrom a policy and regulatory point of view, Ehrlich believes the initial focus will likely center around security and consumer protection. Above all else, he says, it is the responsibility of the government to protect its citizens from all threats, be it a terrorist attack, criminal activity or negligence. So that is the initial threshold that any blockchain application will have to cross. \nBack in September, Rep. Mulvaney said, \u201cBlockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the financial services industry, the U.S. economy and the delivery of government services.\u201d \nEhrlich agreed but with a few qualifiers:\n\u201cFirst, the end state being described here is a long ways out and will necessitate a series of trials and errors combined with a piecemeal approach across different industries. \n\u201cSecond, it is important to remember that we are not building these technology stacks from scratch. There are legacy systems across every industry that must be integrated, updated or replaced, which creates additional complications. \n\u201cThird, we often use the terms blockchain or distributed ledger technologies as if they are monoliths, but they are not.\u201d \nEhrlich contends that there are many different platforms and ecosystems in development and at some point either one will win out or there will have to be a way for multiple blockchains to communicate with one another. \u201cA siloed approach will not work at scale,\u201d he said. \nAccording to Ehrlich, assuming that these hurdles are cleared, blockchain technology offers the potential to add transparency, speed and efficiency to virtually any industry that requires shared records or knowledge. \n\u201cFrom a cybersecurity point of view, being able to have absolute certainty that your systems and records are maintaining their integrity and confidentiality is invaluable. Additionally, through the use of smart contracts and the transparency of blockchains, state and federal governments can more efficiently collect taxes, disburse benefits, track spending, etc.\u201d \nEhrlich cites what\u2019s currently taking place in state governments as just one example, saying that it will be very interesting to follow developments in Delaware over the course of 2017, as they are already working on a live project involving smart contracts and their public archives. \nHe says that the state has even loftier plans, including legally enforceable smart UCC filings, and expects the takeaways from these projects to reverberate throughout Washington and around the country.", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 27}

The collective, which includes Intel, Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, Banco Santander and ConsenSys, will also launch a reference architecture, named EntEth 1.0.\n\u201cThis body is going to work on standardizing the technology for enterprise settings, and that will only help the public Ethereum main net,\u201d Andrew Keys, head of global business development at ConsenSys, one of the founding members, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nEnterprise\nEthereum is a public and permissionless blockchain, which means that anyone can use it for whatever they see fit. While this is useful \u2014 even needed \u2014 for certain types of applications, it is not always suited for others. In particular, financial institutions and enterprise-level organizations tend to fork Ethereum\u2019s codebase, launching their own pilot projects rather than using the Ethereum blockchain itself.\nKeys revealed the launch of the EEA at the Distributed: Markets conference in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\u201cEnterprises are already deploying Ethereum networks. They\u2019re taking the open-source version of the protocol that\u2019s used for the permissionless next-generation of the internet,\u201d Keys told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBut there\u2019s a difference between the permissionless next-generation of the internet, and permissioned private networks. Our position is that these enterprises shouldn\u2019t be playing at the protocol level. They should be building applications on top. And all of this needs to be standardized.\u201d\nThis standardization process will now be led by the EEA, which consists of 30 members at launch. It has a rotating board that includes Accenture, Banco Santander, BlockApps, BNY Mellon, CME Group, ConsenSys, IC3, Intel, J.P. Morgan, Microsoft and Nuco. The additional founding members are AMIS, Andui, BBVA, brainbot technologies, BP, Chronicled, Credit Suisse, Cryptape, Fubon Financial, ING, The Institutes, Monax, String Labs, Telindus, Tendermint, Thomson Reuters, UBS, VidRoll and Wipro.\n\u201cLike many financial institutions, Santander has been actively exploring the use of distributed ledger technology and Ethereum has been one of the platforms-of-choice on which to build proof-of-concepts and prototypes.\u201d said Julio Faura, Head of Research & Development for Innovation at Banco Santander. \u201cWith its large developer community, 1.5 years of testing in a public environment, and multiple implementations, Santander is enthusiastic in its support of the goals of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and its goal of developing a single set of standards for using Ethereum in an enterprise setting.\u201d\nEntEth 1.0\nAt the heart of the EEA is a reference architecture, EntEth 1.0. \nEntEth 1.0 is a standard, not a product, and is designed specifically for the needs of enterprise. Compared to Ethereum itself, EntEth 1.0 will include a stronger focus on privacy, similar to J.P. Morgan\u2019s private Ethereum implementation, Quorum. It will also include more extensive permissioning, allowing a customizable way by which information can be shared, with whom, and to what extent.\nAnd, perhaps most important, EntEth 1.0 will include \u201cpluggable consensus.\u201d\n\u201cIf you have a very strong consensus algorithm, you\u2019re going to have very few transactions per second,\u201d Keys said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re in a permissionless network like Bitcoin or public Ethereum, you need that hard consensus. While if you\u2019re in a private one, you don\u2019t need it. So, depending on the type of transaction you\u2019re in, you\u2019ll be able to change the types of consensus algorithms.\u201d\nAs a unique option, EntEth 1.0 can also be plugged into the main Ethereum network.

With the acquisition, Bloq wants to enhance its suite of analysis tools and position itself to maximize the value of blockchain data sets through AI and machine learning.\nThe Chicago-based company focuses on solving key business issues surrounding security, provenance, authentication and reconciliation. The new acquisition, whose detailed terms haven\u2019t been disclosed, includes Skry\u2019s intellectual property and team, which seems a perfect fit for Bloq\u2019s focus on empowering better visibility and decision-making in a multi-blockchain, multi-network world.\n\u201cFinancial institutions will need a full suite of tools to take blockchain [technology]\u2019s role from high-tech database to business-driver,\u201d Bloq\u2019s Co-Founder and Chairman Matthew Roszak explained to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cSkry\u2019s technology adds a keystone layer of analytics to our current platform, and will open the door for enterprise blockchains to become as smart as they are efficient.\u201d\nBloq\u2019s portfolio includes high-profile projects, such as a partnership with Deloitte to build blockchain software solutions for leading companies worldwide; a partnership with PwC Australia to launch Vulcan Digital Asset Services, a new fintech business platform to accelerate the adoption of digital money and assets; and the \u201cBlockchain Operating System\u201d BloqEnterprise. The company is a member of the Hyperledger Project, a collaborative cross-industry effort to advance blockchain technology, led by the Linux Foundation, to whose Board of Directors Jeff Garzik, co-founder and CEO of Bloq, was appointed in November.\n\u201cBlockchain networks need more than a rudimentary finder or explorer,\u201d said Garzik. \u201cWe\u2019re ensuring that enterprises won\u2019t have to \u2018fly blind\u2019 without a complete understanding of the performance, economics and irregularities of their underlying networks.\u201d\n\u201cBlockchain networks will create the greatest data sets we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d added Roszak. \u201cLeveraging machine learning techniques will enable faster and enhanced decision making, while uncovering insights and massive opportunities along the way.\u201d\nIn fact, the Skry platform leverages the awesome power of modern AI technology. According to the company, AI allows users to extract insights at a speed and scale that no human can on their own. \u201cThrough novel interfaces the Skry platform allows domain experts to supercharge their intuition with the power of machine intelligence,\u201d notes the Skry website. \u201cDeep Learning technologies are combined with behavioral, predictive, graph and descriptive-prescriptive analytics to not only learn from the past, but to anticipate and predict illicit activities, suspicious user behavior, fraud and anomalies.\u201d Deep Learning indicates a subset of AI technology for machine learning.\nFormerly known as Coinalytics, in 2015, it raised $1.1 million in a seed round led by Palo Alto\u2013based incubator The Hive. Skry rebranded in April 2016 and added top AI experts to its team. The announcement noted Skry\u2019s intention to position itself at the forefront of applying AI and machine learning to turn blockchain data into actionable insights, \u201cwhich will have a crucial impact on the future of this technology, beyond Bitcoin.\u201d \n\u201cBloq is one of the few blockchain software companies with a comprehensive vision for what enterprise customers need to launch and manage blockchain networks and applications,\u201d said Fabio Federici, former CEO and co-founder of Skry. \u201cIts team stressed interoperability and painstakingly engineered its technology from day one to be blockchain-agnostic. I\u2019m excited to have Skry be a part of that future.\u201d\nIt seems likely that the acquisition of Skry\u2019s AI intellectual property and team will strengthen Bloq\u2019s position as a leading provider of high-tech blockchain solutions for demanding clients. In fact, with more and more companies and institutions adopting blockchain-based solutions, and more and more complex, potentially critical data stored in distributed ledgers, there\u2019s a growing need for sophisticated analysis methods, which AI technology can provide.", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 28}
{"title": "Delivering a New Blockchain-Based Patient Care Model", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/delivering-new-blockchain-based-patient-care-model/", "birthday": "Mar 1, 2017  5:25 PM EST", "date": "2017-03-01 22:25:00", "content": "With promises on the part of the new Trump administration to reboot Obamacare, the U.S. healthcare system is at a crossroads. Staggering costs, barriers to patient access and quality-of-care concerns underscore the need for innovative solutions to address this key element of America\u2019s future.\nOne company firmly entrenched in efforts to address many of these prevailing issues is Atlanta-based Patientory. It endeavors to deliver population-health management solutions that assist healthcare organizations in boosting clinical outcomes through physician-coordinated care. Through the use of a patient-centered protocol supported by blockchain technology, Patientory is poised to change the way patients securely manage their health histories and interact with their clinical care teams.\nThrough use of the company\u2019s mobile app, Patientory users create an individual profile. Their medical information is then stored on a secure, HIPAA-compliant blockchain platform, allowing them to connect with care providers as well as other patients who have similar health issues or concerns. This allows patients greater control over their overall health across multiple care teams, both inside and outside of the hospital. \nThe company\u2019s genesis is tied to the 2016 inaugural class of the Boomtown Health-Tech Accelerator in Boulder, Colorado. This led to a collaborative exchange with the Denver-based Colorado Permanente Medical Group, part of the Kaiser Permanente consortium, based in Oakland, California. \nDespite its startup status, the company has established a deep footprint in the healthcare landscape. For CEO Chrissa McFarlane, who has over 10 years of experience in the industry, Patientory reflects her personal journey and frustration with patients not having access to a central depository of their own health information and to a supportive community. \nFacilitating Patient-Centered Care\n \nMcFarlane notes that while the Affordable Care Act reflected the Obama government\u2019s effort to create a more unified health system, in the current state of chaos, the solution \u00a0ultimately boils down to the individual having the necessary resources to make informed decisions regarding their health. \n\u201cOur platform is primarily patient focused. We make it easy for patients to connect with their health, which includes their information, caregivers and a peer community of individuals for support. Unfortunately, this has never existed in the U.S. And while other healthcare companies are trying to achieve similar goals, it\u2019s on a very siloed level.\u201d \nFrom a clinical standpoint, the Patientory app makes it easy for a patient care team to interact and share data, including medication and overall health history. Physicians and other care providers can therefore coordinate care over the continuum of a patient\u2019s care journey. \nSimilarly, patients can interact with all of their physicians at once, in real time, fostering greater coordination of care efficiencies and cost savings. This is a valuable feature for patients with chronic conditions who often deal with a host of physicians, specialists and subspecialists who play a role in their care.\nMoreover, the portability of their health records allows a new physician easy access to their health histories, reducing the burdensome take of having to reinvent the wheel whenever a new health provider is contacted. \nSecurity\nIn light of the growing number of data breaches facing the healthcare industry, blockchain technology\u2019s major value proposition within the healthcare sector revolves around its robust security protocol, which makes HIPAA compliance feasible for both patients and providers. \nBuilt on the belief that decentralized hospital records improve information security, Patientory employs data networking and medical information storage in a manner that allows patients to manage their own health data repositories, thereby improving overall patient care and well-being. \nFrom electronic health information confidentiality to security threats identification to disclosure protection, Patientory\u2019s employment of blockchain technology helps the healthcare ecosystem mitigate damaging data breaches.\u00a0Unlike electronic health records, which are vulnerable to hacks, blockchain technology is able to utilize a more secure, permanent record of online information exchange.\u00a0\nGreater Efficiency\nOn a macro level, Patientory\u2019s ability to coordinate care greatly alleviates the occurrence of unnecessary and wasteful services. A care team\u2019s ability to access a patient\u2019s health history decreases the likelihood that they\u2019ll rerun duplicate tests. This can lead to lower costs and greater efficiencies in the overall continuum of care. \n\u201cOur primary health moonshot goal is cost to zero,\u201d says McFarlane. \u201cIn other words the goal is to radically reduce the cost of care by a factor of a million. By offering automated treatments care plans and coordinated care through a health community network, the industry will see an 85 percent decrease in hospital readmissions/penalties along with zero healthcare breaches through decentralized blockchain technology.\u201d \nConcludes McFarlane: \u201cWe\u2019re anxious to see the effects of Patientory\u2019s value in the industry, specifically how it improves the quality of life of those suffering from chronic illnesses. The uncertainty for the future of Obamacare breeds hope for blockchain technology startups like Patientory, which seeks to fill the gaps in our health system, empowering the individual patient to take charge of their own health in a proactive way.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 1}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nSome of the most popular Bitcoin services on the internet may have leaked sensitive user information, including passwords.\nCloudflare is a popular content delivery network that effectively acts as a sort of digital shield, a proxy that offers millions of websites DoS protection and other services. Some of the biggest websites on the internet use Cloudflare, including several well-known Bitcoin companies, like Coinbase, Kraken, LocalBitcoins, Poloniex and more\nAny data sent to and from these websites essentially passes through Cloudflare. This includes passwords, as well as cookies, authentication tokens and other sensitive information.\nLast week, an exploit now known as \u201cCloudbleed\u201d \u2014 a reference to the Heartbleed security bug \u2014 was discovered by Google Project Zero security researcher Tavis Ormandy. A major flaw in Cloudflare\u2019s infrastructure, caused by what is known as a \u201cbuffer overflow,\u201d basically spilled data all across the internet. Whenever anyone requested data from a particular website or mobile app protected by Cloudflare, Cloudflare could randomly send data from completely different websites along with it.\n\u201cWe fetched a few live samples, and we observed encryption keys, cookies, passwords, chunks of POST data and even HTTPS requests for other major Cloudflare-hosted sites from other users,\u201d Ormandy wrote in his blog entry.\nThe vulnerability is significant in scope as well as length. It could have been exploited anytime between September 22 and February 20, while the period of greatest impact was between February 13 and 18. And as a potentially bigger concern, some search engines may have even cached the sensitive data as well, meaning it\u2019s publicly available to anyone.\nThe good news is that the odds of sensitive data falling into the wrong hands so far seems relatively small. \u201cWe have also not discovered any evidence of malicious exploits of the bug or other reports of its existence,\u201d Cloudflare itself wrote in their incident report.\nHowever, the bad news is that there is no way of knowing exactly what data may have leaked. Users of services that may have been impacted, therefore, should assume their data is no longer secure and change their passwords immediately. (This of course also includes passwords on non-Cloudflare websites that have been used across multiple sites.) \nIt seems less likely that accounts protected with two-factor authentication are vulnerable, though it may depend on the specific implementation; resetting it is still advisable. Those that use API keys should be reset too.\nCloudflare has since patched the bug, and some search engines (like Google) are removing any such data from their caches that they can find.\nSee this GitHub page for more websites that may have been affected by Cloudbleed.", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 24}

So far, over $1.4 billion has been injected globally into blockchain ventures, highlighting the craze surrounding the technology.\n \nIn the financial services industry, the blockchain is perceived by many as a revolutionary technology that could help banks save billions in costs, increase efficiency and reduce risk.\n \nAccenture estimates that blockchain technology could allow financial institutions to save between $8 billion and $12 billion in annual infrastructure costs. Capgemini, a French consulting firm, claims that consumers could save up to $16 billion in banking and insurance fees annually through blockchain-based applications.\n \nThere has been plenty of noise, no doubt, but deep down, is there any substance? Where are we currently standing in terms of development and implementation? And what should we be expecting for the year to come?\n \nAccording to Benjamin Jessel, managing principal at Capco and a blockchain expert, 2018 will be the year blockchain technology comes into production. He names lending, CDS swap trade and post-trade lifecycle, trade finance and business-to-business payments as some of the areas that would first benefit from blockchain technology.\n \nJessel has 12 years of experience in managing technology change within large-scale business transformation programs. Over the last two years, he has been focusing on blockchain technology.\n \nIn an exclusive interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Jessel shares his views on the state of blockchain technology and the journey ahead toward widespread adoption.\n \nBitcoin Magazine (BM): Which stage of the innovation cycle are we currently at with blockchain technology?\n \nBenjamin Jessel (B.J.): There has been extensive news flow about blockchain, and fintech more broadly, which is why we saw record investment in this area in 2015.\n \nHowever, despite venture capital investment, for consultancies, the actual flow of work has been muted, which led many earlier in 2016 into Gartner\u2019s \u201ctrough of despair,\u201d which typifies the capitulation of expectations after a year of overhyping.\n \nI see this market as the classic S-curve: periods of little news flow, followed by a significant market-moving announcement, a significant uptick in activity followed by another plateau.\n \nThe key events that significantly heralded that this market was beginning to come of age were the DTCC announcement to move $14 trillion notional of CDS swaps in partnership with Axoni [and IBM and R3], as well as Axoni\u2019s numerous proof of concepts in FX swaps, CDS and equities swaps, and [Digital Asset and] the\u00a0DTCC\u2019s project to create a blockchain repo system.\n \nAlso, the announcement of the state of Delaware to move company documentation onto the blockchain was significant, as well as the various announcements of the \u201cre-platforming\u201d of exchanges onto [the] blockchain of the likes of Australian Securities Exchange and the Japan Exchange Group.\n \nWith these announcements, we have moved from small proof of concepts relatively under-investmented within innovation centers of financial institutions that were not getting leadership attention, to C-level mandated proof of concepts supported by actual business cases and a roadmap into production. This is why we are calling 2018 as the year of production for blockchain [technology].\n \nBM: What should we be expecting in the space this year, and in which areas do you see blockchain technology being implemented first?\n \nB.J: The nature of blockchain [technology] is that there is an element of secrecy because of the first-mover advantage, so there is an element of piecing together some of the clues.\n \nI see leveraged loans as something that could transition into an initial production environment (albeit few parties initially), the major players being Ipreo, Synapse and Credit Suisse, as well as Digital Asset Holdings with JPMorgan. This is a red-hot market that represents $762 billion and which is still being done primarily manually.\n \nAlso, the Chain\u2013Visa deal, which is about implementing a new network for Visa (their first new one [in] 60 years), will result in Visa entering the business-to-business lending space.\n \nWe know that the Australian stock exchange has spent $20 million so far on implementing a blockchain solution to replace its CHESS system, so we may see some additional news flow about this as well.\n \nSettlement is an interesting area. Financial institutions are working on mechanisms to settle vast amounts of money between each other without having to settle in actual currency, which is costly. However, to be really effective, they need central banks to get behind it and either enable financial institutions to treat this digital settlement as if it were as good as cash, or to actually underwrite the digital settlement as if it was fiat currency. The Bank of Canada has been making moves in this area, and the R3 project Jasper was a great example of a proof of concept in this area.\n \nIn terms of consortia, I do see R3 continuing to go from strength to strength. It\u2019s possible that they may have challenges in retaining some members as what happened early this year, but I see that as a natural churn as parties with more capabilities have less to gain from a consortium than other members.\n \nAlso, the recent announcement of a European consortium in blockchain trade finance is noteworthy, so I will be keeping a close eye on that.\n \nBM: Will blockchain technology become a standard in the financial services industry?\n \nB.J: We need to be a little careful about using the word \u201cstandard\u201d with blockchain [technology].\n \nFirst of all, we\u2019re actually now seeing a move away from blockchain [technology], which is about all transactions chained together for everyone to see, and a move toward a distributed ledger, one place for all transactions but only the ones that organizations are contractually able to access.\n \nSecondly, there will not be a single standard. Just as in the handling of data, we moved from flat file in the \u201970s to relational databases in the \u201980s with a whole ecosystem of ways to access and manipulate the data.\n \nSo what we\u2019re going to see are the principles of the technology: provenance of information, immutability of records, single source of truth accessible to those that are permissioned to do so, the ability to build business process logic on top to automate operational functions based on that data.\n \nIn terms of areas I see moving first, I see the first wave being: lending, CDS swap trade and post-trade lifecycle, trade finance, business-to-business payments and reference data.\n \nBM: Besides financial services, what other industries could benefit from blockchain technology? \n \nB.J: The provenance aspect is very powerful when it comes to supply chain. Walmart, for example, is looking into provenance for meat. In Europe, there was a big scandal with horsemeat entering the food chain. Knowing exactly where your food is coming from is something blockchain [technology] could do very well.\n \nSimilarly with any kind of product that has been created using constituent parts. Particularly in electronics, where security of what country manufactured a certain part is becoming more important.\n \nDubai has recently announced an initiative where they are integrating blockchain [technology] into their smart cities and has recently selected an organization we worked closely with, Loyyal, to integrate blockchain-based loyalty into the city.\n", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 3}

Moroz said that through a mix of song performances and storytelling with her talks, she illustrates the benefits of digital currencies to make it more engaging for her audience.\n\u201cI want to enlighten artists and musicians on a transformative technology that allows for true artistic freedom and creates a fair, transparent economy,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, I want to create greater access to and rewards for fans who believe in the work of artists.\u201d\nSince the launch of Tatiana Coin, artists have been very receptive of the technology, said Moroz. In her opinion, musicians have been the \u201cslave class in the industry,\u201d so the time has come for disruption.\u00a0\u00a0In her home base of New York, Moroz wants to spearhead a grassroots effort to engage artists. However, she believes this technology can help streamline and power all aspects of the industry to benefit everyone. \n\u201cI am excited to see this platform begin to connect communities directly with creatives, and keep the middleman services as optional and transparent,\u201d she adds.\nMusicoin\nMusicoin, which was created by Brian Byrne, Isaac Mao and Dan Phifer, is a decentralized system for the publication and consumption of music, combining a cutting-edge digital currency with a peer-to-peer file sharing network, which aims to bring a level of transparency and fairness to the music industry. It does this by allowing musicians to license their content via a \u201ccoded contract\u201d directly to the blockchain. With the contract, they automate the collection and distribution of royalty payments, which remain in the control of the artists themselves. \nEach time an artist\u2019s track is played, the \u201cpay per play\u201d contract is executed by the system, resulting in a payment using the Musicoin currency. This is sent directly from the listener to the musician, who has granted the listener access to a specific piece of work.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Byrne said Musicoin is solving the problem that musicians face by keeping artists connected to their music.\n\u201cThey know that by using Musicoin, without fail or question, that when someone hits play on our platform that payment goes directly to them,\u201d he said. \u201cA real transaction that is transparent with no intermediary.\u201d\nAs someone who has been a recording and touring artist, Byrne said that he understands what it\u2019s like to try and navigate contracts with record labels and managers while watching the misuse of funds and the failed answers to royalty payments.\n\u201cWhen I was first introduced to this idea by Isaac and Dan, I knew without a doubt that this was something I would fight for, to see it come to fruition and let every artist know about it,\u201d he said.\nAccording to Musicoin, over 80 percent of royalty fees are kept by intermediaries, which, prior to the digital age, helped musicians to organize, plan, record, produce and distribute their music. Since then, that role has expanded and it is for that reason musicians can\u2019t make a living.\nHowever, through Musicoin\u2019s theory of the Sharism Model, each playback represents an exchange between the musician and the listener.\nAs a project that is self-funded with no ICO, no pre-allocation to the founders and no pre-mining, Byrne states that their aim is about leveling the playing field, putting the artist first and figuring out the problem.\nByrne says that even though there will be those who don\u2019t think the platform will work, the feedback so far has been positive.\n\u201cEveryone seems to be really thrilled with the idea, how it works, the support in the community and the potential it has,\u201d he said.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 2}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nBlocks on the Bitcoin network have been increasingly full lately, except for some of the ones mined by AntPool, which is the largest mining pool on the network. In the past 24 hours from the time this article was written, every non-empty block mined by someone other than AntPool was practically full of transactions, nearly up to the 1 MB limit.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the details regarding these smaller blocks.\nLeaving Some Transactions Behind\nRecently, AntPool has been mining a number of blocks with sizes of around 99 KB, 369 KB and 860 KB. There were dozens of blocks mined around these specific sizes during the month of February. During the times these blocks were mined, everyone else on the network was filling blocks with transactions up to the 1 MB capacity limit.\nIn addition to the non-full blocks mined by AntPool, the mining pool also created 16 empty blocks in the month of February. The total amount of transaction capacity lost by the network during this time as a result of AntPool\u2019s small blocks is not difficult to estimate. Numbers shared by BitFury\u2019s Alex Petrov show AntPool\u2019s average mined block size in February was around 100 KB less than other mining pools of comparable size.\nThe number of transactions in a block can vary, but at an average transaction size of 500 bytes, 100 KB would amount to roughly 200 transactions. With 768 blocks mined, AntPool essentially included 153,600 less transactions in February than other large mining pools, such as BitFury or F2Pool, which would have mined with a similar share of the network. This is roughly half of the total number of transactions that are mined on the entire Bitcoin network per day.\nAccording to data available on Blockchair.com, AntPool\u2019s 99 KB and 369 KB blocks became more frequent on February 2, while the 860 KB blocks did not become more frequent until February 23.\nThis Is Not the First Time\nThis is not the first time AntPool has mined small blocks with transactions readily available in the mempool. The issue of small blocks also popped up late last year. \n\u201cAntPool is designed to be decentralized, and we have mining nodes distributed around the world, each with its own Bitcoin client, so that when one pool node [finds a] new block, the synchronization of [that] block will [take] a certain time, and we will construct [an] empty block or small block using only the block header,\u201d an AntPool representative told Bitcoin Magazine in an unpublished comment at the time.\n\u201cAnd in order to solve this problem, we developed a new block broadcast system. Blocks can be broadcast to the world in 1 to 3 seconds through this system. The recent system is the final testing, and now there will be some empty or small blocks, but after we finished the test, the probability of empty block[s] appears to [be] a minimum, and we will open source system.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the recent string of small blocks has also been caused by testing mining-related software.\nIn addition to these issues with small blocks, AntPool has a preference for mining empty blocks, presumably because the pool engages in spy mining or other optimization strategies. \u201cSorry, we will continue mining empty blocks,\u201d Bitmain Co-CEO Jihan Wu tweeted a little over a year ago. \u201cThis is the freedom given by the Bitcoin protocol.\u201d\nBitmain is an ASIC mining hardware manufacturer and also runs the AntPool mining pool.\nThe number of empty blocks mined by AntPool and other mining pools has massively declined over the past year or so.\nWhen asked for specifics on why AntPool is not mining full blocks whenever possible, an Antpool representative did not have any comments to share with Bitcoin Magazine.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 3}
{"title": "The Latest Twist to the Block Size Debate Is Called a \u201cUASF\u201d", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/latest-twist-block-size-debate-called-uasf/", "birthday": "Mar 2, 2017  4:22 PM EST", "date": "2017-03-02 21:22:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nJust when Bitcoin\u2019s long-lasting scalability dispute appeared to have reached a deadlock, a pseudonymous mailing-list contributor may have presented a way out.\nSegregated Witness (SegWit), the Bitcoin protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team, would roughly double Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit, while laying the groundwork for further scaling solutions. But this proposal that requires 95 percent of hash power support to activate has been slow to gain miner adoption. And there is little indication this will change anytime soon. \nNow, there may be an alternative route to activation.\n\u201c[T]he signaling methodology is widely misinterpreted to mean the hash power is voting on a proposal and it seems difficult to correct this misunderstanding in the wider community,\u201d a so-far unknown person under the pseudonym \u201cshaolinfry\u201d noted on the Bitcoin-development mailing list and the BitcoinTalk forum last weekend. \nAnd:\u201cThe alternative discussed here is \u2018flag day activation\u2019 where nodes begin enforcement at a predetermined time in the future.\u201d\nThis alternative is called a \u201cuser activated soft fork\u201d or \u201cUASF.\u201d\nHash Power Activated Soft Forks\nSoft forks are changes to the Bitcoin protocol that tighten up the rules. Transactions or blocks that would have been valid under the old rules become invalid under the new rules. \nAn interesting property of soft forks is that some users can upgrade to the new set of rules, while other users do not, or at least, not yet. They would all remain part of the same network, use the same blockchain and transact in the same currency; it\u2019s just that some users may be looking at slightly different data.\n\u201cSoft forks are backwards compatible and opt-in,\u201d shaolinfry argued in a follow-up email. \u201cSo long as they are well written and bug free, users should, at worst, be agnostic towards them because they have a choice whether to safely use the new feature or not, without preventing others\u2019 \u00a0enjoyment of the feature.\u201d\nOver the past couple of years, soft forks were mostly implemented by hash power activation. This utilizes the fact that miners decide which valid transactions they include in blocks anyway. A majority of miners can reject certain types of transactions and blocks from the blockchain if they violate the new soft fork rules, even transactions that \u201cold nodes\u201d would still consider valid.\nSegregated Witness as proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team is a soft fork. But with this soft fork proposal in particular, hash power activation seems to be approached as something akin to an election.\nWhich, shaolinfry argued, it is not:\n\u201c[A] problem with supermajority hash power signaling is it draws unnecessary attention to miners which can become unnecessarily political. Already misunderstood as a vote, miners may feel pressure to \u2018make a decision\u2019 on behalf of the community: who is and isn\u2019t signaling becomes a huge public focus and may put pressures onto miners they are unprepared for.\u201d\nThe alternative, shaolinfry therefore proposed, is to introduce UASFs as an activation method.\nUASF\nThe concept of a UASF is actually even more straightforward than a hash power activated soft fork.\nRather than miners, it\u2019s the Bitcoin economy \u2014 individual users, merchants, exchanges, wallet providers and other economic actors \u2014 that activates the soft fork with the software they run. At a specific point in time, the Bitcoin economy tightens up the rules of the system, activating the soft fork. From that point on, everyone simply rejects transactions and blocks that break the new rules.\nRealistically, the miners would then have to follow the new rules as well, or at least take certain safety precautions to avoid accepting invalid blocks and transactions. If they don\u2019t, they risk producing blocks the economy deems invalid and rejects. The miners would not be able spend the coins they earned in the block reward, deposit them at an exchange nor otherwise use them. For all intents and purposes, they would not have earned bitcoins at all, and instead wasted resources producing a worthless block.\nTo earn a block reward that has actual value, miners will therefore need to do what the economy wants them to do, shaolinfry argued:\n\u201cThe hash powers\u2019 role is to select valid transactions, and to extend the blockchain with valid blocks. Fully validating economic nodes ensure that blocks are valid. Nodes therefore define validity according to the software they run, but miners decide what already valid transactions get included in the [blockchain].\u201d\nLike all soft forks, a UASF would still be an opt-in proposition for regular users, assuming it activates smoothly. If some users don\u2019t like SegWit, for example, they can choose not to upgrade. Meanwhile, other users can enjoy the benefits SegWit offers.\nDrawbacks\nWhile the concept of a UASF is straightforward, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s easy to pull off. Compared to hash power activated soft forks, UASFs introduce two increased risks. And not unlike hard forks, if things go badly, Bitcoin can split into two incompatible networks, blockchains and currencies.\nThe first risk is that coordination can be difficult. Most important, it\u2019s hard to know for sure whether a UASF is really backed, and will be enforced, by the economy. Support from centralized services \u2014 exchanges, wallet providers, payment processors \u2014 can perhaps be gauged, but individual Bitcoin nodes are trivially spoofed. And if only a minority of the economy enforces the new rules and a majority enforces the original rules, Bitcoin would split in two.\nSecond, even if a significant majority of the economy does enforce the soft fork, a determined (or perhaps very lazy) majority of miners can still frustrate the upgrade. If these miners are willing and able to waste energy mining the \u201cold\u201d chain, any non-upgraded user would follow this \u201cminer chain,\u201d rather than the valuable \u201ceconomy chain.\u201d This user would be susceptible to double-spends, at least for as long as these miners are willing and able to waste resources.\nThat said, these risks are bigger with hard forks, and similar problems can occur even with hash power activated soft forks, as the BIP66 blockchain split showed.As noted by shaolinfry:\u201cValidation has always had a strong requirement.\u201d\nThanks to BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp for feedback.

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nGold bugs everywhere lost some luster today when bitcoin broke parity with gold in USD terms. Interestingly, gold, as an element, had many advantages over other possibilities as a use for currency. Arguably, Bitcoin, with its secure network and utility, is a better version of gold for today\u2019s digital age. The psychological resistance of gold price and bitcoin price parity has long been held among many traders, especially those who trade legacy FOREX markets. It is also a metric frequently touted in popular media. Could a digital asset really ever be worth more than a physical one that has withstood the test of time?\nLet\u2019s take a look at a few charts:\n1W BLX vs. XAU-USD\n\nEven before January, bitcoin had made large gains on the price of gold, closing the parity gap very quickly over recent months as gold remained in a sideways range. The index currently shows the price sitting at near parity. Teasing that apart further, we can see two things: BTC-USD has made a clean break above XAU-USD, and BTC-CNY remains below XAU-CNY.\n4h BTC-USD \u2014 Coinbase vs. XAU-USD\n\n4h BTC-CNY \u2014 OKCoin vs. XAU-CNY\n\nIn January, when BTC-CNY broke gold parity, BTC-USD did not. This was largely because of the greater demand in BTC-CNY versus BTC-USD. The exact opposite can be said for current market conditions. Bitcoin\u2019s price is being driven by USD demand, thus BTC-USD has broken gold parity, whereas BTC-CNY has not.\nIn my opinion, gold parity will not truly be broken until the index of both BTC-USD and BTC-CNY are above their respective gold prices. The current dichotomy suggests that, just as BTC-CNY was overbought in January when it broke gold parity, BTC-USD is likely overbought now. \nWith the COIN ETF decision quickly approaching on March 11, USD demand is slowly pricing in an approval decision from the SEC. I\u2019d expect BTC-USD to continue holding above XAU-USD until the ETF decision, when we may see the \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d paradigm, causing the BTC-USD price to break below gold parity again. \nAlthough it is an exciting milestone for Bitcoin, it\u2019s largely an ideological bump in the road and has little meaning for the network or future price itself. Based on utility, ease of access, fungibility, security and storage, bitcoin stands far above gold for today\u2019s world. After all, bitcoin is easily spendable, but it\u2019s rare to find a merchant, online or otherwise, who accepts gold as payment. \u00a0\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Using RC Cloud, Japanese banks were able to make real-time money transfers at a lower cost than before. \nRipple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated: \u201cConsortiums are not hard to come by in this industry, but what makes this significant is that these leading Japanese banks are focused on a clear use case and moving [the] blockchain into production. This is a concrete example that our solution is already transforming how money is sent around the world.\u201d\nThe Ripple payment network is especially beneficial for smaller Japanese banks, which to date have had to rely on their larger counterparts to clear their transactions due to the high annual clearinghouse membership fees. That has left smaller institutions with little control over the fees they are being charged, which affects their profitability in this space. However, by using the blockchain as the underlying technology for Ripple\u2019s payments platform, all financial transactions are recorded securely on an immutable peer-to-peer network, which means there is no need for costly intermediaries or a central clearing counterparty to process payments. \n\u201cExisting infrastructure favor high-volume processors. [They] get the cheapest price. With distributed ledger technology, it doesn\u2019t matter because the little guy can speak to another little guy and it\u2019s just as cheap if they did 10,000 transactions or two,\u201d Dilip Rao, managing director for Asia Pacific at Ripple, told CNBC.\nThe next step will be the commercialization of Ripple\u2019s payments platform in the Japanese banking sector. During the pilot phase, Ripple\u2019s RC Cloud was analyzed and evaluated from all business-relevant angles, including regulatory requirements, operational risks, standardization and its potential integration into banks\u2019 accounting systems. \nSince the pilot was deemed to be successful, the consortium now intends to reach out to international banks to include them in Ripple\u2019s payments network to reduce the costs and improve the efficiency of cross-border money transfers across the globe. \n\u201cDomestic and cross-border payments have been silo processes that are expensive, but RC Cloud allows for a seamless transaction for both types of payments on one platform,\u201d stated SBI Ripple Asia CEO Takashi Okita.\nRipple asserts that through the use of blockchain technology, retail remittance costs can be reduced by 60 percent and corporate cross-border money transfer costs can be reduced by 50 percent. \nGiven Japan\u2019s positive stance toward Bitcoin, blockchain technology and digital currencies in general, it would not be surprising to see the country\u2019s financial industry become the first to commercially implement and use blockchain technology to improve its services.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 3}

Brownworth also explained Circle\u2019s need for state channels and why the company is now building a new platform on top of Ethereum.\nCircle Still Uses Bitcoin\nDuring the opening portion of his presentation, Brownworth made it clear that Circle has by no means stopped using Bitcoin completely. In fact, Bitcoin still plays a key role in the background of the company\u2019s operations.\n\u201cBitcoin very fundamentally informs the way Circle works behind the scenes, and it continues to do so,\u201d stated Brownworth. \u201cWe continue to use it.\u201d\nIn addition to various background operations, Brownworth also noted that Circle has helped fund MIT\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), which funds Bitcoin Core contributor Cory Fields, Bitcoin Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan and lightning network developer Tadge Dryja. In the past, former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Gavin Andresen was also a part of the MIT DCI.\nCircle also operates a trading desk for bitcoin and other digital currencies. \u201cWe actually operate a trading desk for all virtual currencies \u2014 a very active trading desk,\u201d noted Brownworth.\nThe Need for State Channels\nAccording to Brownworth, one of the main things Circle is working on right now is Spark. It\u2019s unclear if this is an attempt by Circle to create the main payment platform of the future to replace the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum as Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said was needed late last year.\nBrownworth described Spark as \u201csmart contract driven,\u201d and the Circle chief evangelist explained the payments company\u2019s need for state channels on any system they build. \u201cWe\u2019ll use state channels to keep the cost of transactions low \u2014 keep the fees low \u2014 and also to add privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cFor us, state channels are very, very important. We need them either formally supported or we need the contract primitives to be available, so we can make time-locked contracts (HTLCs).\u201d\nAn example of state channels is payment channels in Bitcoin where many payments can be made between two parties before eventually being settled on the blockchain. The lightning network is an attempt to create a generalized layer of payment channels where users can send payments to a wide number of other parties via this mechanism.\nAccording to Brownworth, Circle will eventually open-source the Spark platform, and they have no plans to try to compete with other solutions at the platform level. Instead, Circle will focus on building apps on top of the Spark platform.\nWhile Brownworth noted that there were many options for building the Spark platform, Circle\u2019s initial implementation uses Ethereum. Brownworth also described the process of learning what it\u2019s like to build on top of these sorts of smart contracting platforms. \n\u201cWhat became obvious very quickly, very early on is it\u2019s really, really hard to make a smart contract system maintainable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do the sort of Solidity 1.0 basic example and set up your own currency, that\u2019s great and all until tomorrow when you want to add a new feature and you have to delete everybody\u2019s accounts. Or you have to build in a path for all of that information to make its way into the new contract.\u201d\nBrownworth added that their current line of thinking is to create a core, permissioning contract that will tell other contracts when there is a new version of that contract available. He also added that this system will be for IOUs rather than digital bearer assets.\nWhy Build on Ethereum?\nDuring the Q&A portion of his talk, an audience member asked Brownworth to further clarify why Circle was using Ethereum for Spark. \n\u201cWe could have done this a lot of different ways,\u201d responded Brownworth. \u201cWe looked at many different options for technologies to implement this in. Essentially, what it comes down to is, believe it or not, maturity at this point versus all of the others.\u201d\nBrownworth added that Hyperledger and Corda are also interesting, but the maturity of the code available for those platforms does not meet Circle\u2019s needs right now. \u201cWe actually built this in a number of different platforms, and we ended up coming to the realization that the practical way to implement this right now is Ethereum,\u201d he said.\nWhile Spark is being built using Ethereum right now, Brownworth added that Spark is made to be interoperable with other blockchains and platforms via state channels as well.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 6}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nToday marks the official release of Bitcoin Core 0.14.0, the fourteenth generation of Bitcoin\u2019s original software client launched by Satoshi Nakamoto eight years ago. Overseen by Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, this latest major release was developed by nearly 100 contributors over a six-month period.\nBitcoin Core 0.14.0 features a significant list of improvements. Compared to some previous releases, however, most of these concern \u201cinternals\u201d of the software: performance improvements that take place under the hood but may not be very noticeable for everyday users.\nThat said, here are some of the more notable changes.\n\u201cAssumevalid\u201d Blocks\nWhenever a new node bootstraps on the network, it syncs the entire blockchain. It downloads and verifies all blocks that were ever mined, and verifies all transactions in all of these blocks. Unfortunately, this can take quite some time. Even new, high-end laptops often require more than a full day to catch up. For older or lower-grade machines, it takes even longer.\n\u201cAssumevalid\u201d significantly speeds up this process. In essence, Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 nodes assume that all transactions up to a certain block are valid. While a syncing node still verifies the proof of work for all blocks, and records the entire transaction history, it no longer checks signatures and similar data for each individual transaction.\nThe assumption as to which block is valid is configurable. By default, it\u2019s block 453354 for Bitcoin Core 0.14.0. But users who do want to fully verify every single transaction, even those dating years back, still can.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that, as opposed to a checkpointing system that establishes that a specific block must be part of the blockchain, the assumed valid block is not necessarily binding. A Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 node will readily switch to an alternative blockchain without the assumed valid block, if that alternative blockchain is longer.\nImproved Fee Estimation\nAs Bitcoin blocks have been filling up, particularly over the last year, not all transactions sent over the network fit into the very next block. As a result, miners usually prioritize transactions that include the most fees. Transactions that include more fees have a higher chance of being included in the very next block or shortly thereafter. Transactions that include lower fees are outbid and take longer to confirm.\nOf course, not everyone needs their transactions to confirm as quickly. Users who send bitcoins to an exchange because of rapid price movements may be in a rush to have their transactions confirmed. Meanwhile, users who move bitcoins between their own wallets may be more patient. \nSince Bitcoin Core 0.10.0, users have been able to adjust their fees accordingly. They can manually include higher fees if they are in more of a rush, and lower fees if they are not. Bitcoin Core 0.11.0 and 0.12.0 both refined the fee estimation software, and Bitcoin 0.14.0 now includes another set of improvements, which in particular makes the algorithm more robust in edge case situations. Additionally, the default confirmation target was decreased from 25 blocks to 6 blocks; most transactions made from Bitcoin Core should confirm within an hour even if the user doesn\u2019t touch the fee settings.\nOpt-In Replace-by-Fee for Sending\nIn addition to the improved fee estimation, Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 users have another option to speed up their transactions.\nFirst introduced a year ago with the release of Bitcoin Core 0.12.0, Bitcoin transactions can be marked with a \u201creplace-by-fee\u201d flag. Senders of a transaction can replace their initial transaction with a newer transaction that includes a higher fee. This allows them to \u201cskip the line\u201d and have their transaction confirmed faster.\nUp until this point, Bitcoin Core only included opt-in replace-by-fee in the node behavior: it accepted and forwarded transactions with replace-by-fee flags (instead of rejecting them as double-spends). But Bitcoin Core users could not utilize opt-in replace-by-fee to bump their own fees; so far only users of wallets like Electrum or GreenAddress could.\nNow, opt-in replace-by-fee has been added as a remote procedure call (RPC) option in Bitcoin Core 0.14.0. This means that users working from the command line, or on applications built on Bitcoin Core, can utilize replace-by-fee, too.\nManual Pruning\nBitcoin\u2019s blockchain is\u00a0over 100 gigabytes in size and at its current rate is growing about 50 gigabytes each year. All that data needs to be stored, which can present a significant burden for users running a full node.\nThat\u2019s why Bitcoin Core 0.11.0 introduced blockchain pruning. Users can get rid of older blocks once they are verified, so running a full node doesn\u2019t require as much disk space.\nBut up till now, users could only prune starting from a fixed number of blocks. With pruning set at 1000 blocks, for example, Bitcoin Core kept exactly the latest 1000 blocks. Whenever a new block was added, the oldest block was discarded, to keep the total at 1000.\nUnfortunately, this meant that certain applications relying on Bitcoin Core couldn\u2019t really utilize pruning. For example, a payment processing application \u2014 for merchants that want to accept bitcoin but prefer not to rely on external services like BitPay or Coinbase \u2014 may in some cases need to figure out whether a valid payment was made in an older block. If that block is already pruned, the application can\u2019t do its job.\nBitcoin Core 0.14.0 therefore allows for more specific pruning. Instead of keeping a set number of blocks, users can prune the blockchain starting from a specific point in time, a specific block height, and keep all blocks that were created since.\nCombined with another new feature called \u201cimportmulti,\u201d Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 can import and timestamp addresses, for example, from the aforementioned payment processing application. Using the timestamps to establish when a specific address was created, Bitcoin Core knows from which point in time blocks are relevant for the application and won\u2019t prune these blocks.\nBlock Relay Improvements\nWhenever a new block is mined, it is transmitted over Bitcoin\u2019s peer-to-peer network, until each node received it. Unfortunately, latency on this network can benefit pooled mining as well as geographic clusters of miners, incentivizing a more centralized mining topology. \nIncreasing block propagation speed has therefore been a central point of focus for the Bitcoin Core development team for some years now, and Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 includes another batch of improvements.\nPerhaps most important, Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 nodes forward blocks to their peers sooner. Where nodes would previously verify a block in its entirety before sending it to connected nodes, Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 starts the forwarding process as soon as the proof of work checks out.\nWhile many miners today do use alternative relay networks as well, increasing speed on Bitcoin\u2019s peer-to-peer network reduces the reliance on these networks and even benefits these relay networks where they connect to the peer-to-peer network.\nAnd \u2026\nAs mentioned, the improvements listed above are really only the tip of the iceberg. Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 includes a list of additional performance improvements, varying from low-level RPC changes, to changes in the graphical user interface (GUI), and anything in between. For a full overview of all improvements, see the Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 release notes.\nYou can download Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 from bitcoincore.org or bitcoin.org.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 7}

The project, still in its early conceptual development phase, has issued draft versions of its white paper and business plan. Vega developers, led by co-founders William Russell and George Van Hoomissen, are building a software infrastructure for smart contracts, which will run the fund with a large degree of autonomy.\n\u201cOur core focus is to promote the growth of crowdfunding investment opportunities offered by companies, organizations and projects that opt to fund their development through newly issued tokens,\u201d notes the fund\u2019s website, emphasizing the difference from traditional venture capital funds and money management services. \n\u201cWe hope to effectively provide the value that many promising projects are seeking, allowing the potential of the [Ethereum] platform to be explored to its fullest potential.\u201d\nBesides providing a funding platform for specific projects, Vega Fund will be focused on encouraging the growth of the ICO market and platform.\nProjects submitted for funding will be assessed by Vega token holders, who will have voting rights for funding decisions, potentially resulting in optimized decision-making by leveraging the wisdom of the crowd. \nThe concept could have applications beyond crowdfunding: In May 2016 futurist Ralph Merkle \u2014 one of the inventors of public key cryptography, the inventor of cryptographic hashing and the originator of the \u201cMerkle trees\u201d used in blockchain systems including Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 published a paper titled \u201cDAOs, Democracy and Governance,\u201d in which he argued that the design principles of Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) could permit the development of better governance systems.\nAnother Ethereum-based system powered by the wisdom of the crowds, the Augur prediction market, provided the inspiration for Vega Fund. \u201cWe were especially absorbed by Augur\u2019s idea of leveraging the wisdom of the crowd to manifest a reliable indication of the likelihood of real-world events,\u201d said Van Hoomissen. \u201cExpanding on this idea, we wanted to see if it could be applied to other ventures.\u201d\nThe concept of a self-driving venture capital fund running on Ethereum smart contracts seems similar to The DAO, a project that made headlines in 2016 by raising a record $100 million in a few weeks. Shortly after launch, The DAO imploded after malicious parties exploited a system flaw to divert funds, which called attention to design weaknesses in The DAO and Ethereum as a whole. The fall of The DAO led to the decision to create a hard fork, which caused a split in the Ethereum system.\nVega Fund, which defines itself partly in terms of its differences from The DAO, wants to avoid running into similar problems by having all changes and security issues up for vote so that the participants in the fund can solve their own problems, instead of relying on a small development team. \n\u201cThe key difference between Vega and The DAO is how we go about facing platform maintenance and security,\u201d explain the Vega founders. \u201cWe view it as unethical to expose users to the downside of potential platform flaws without providing them an avenue to directly effect a solution. Vega token holders will be responsible for scrutinizing Vega\u2019s contracts, and with the Developer Funding Initiative (DFI) in place, they won\u2019t have to rely on the original devs to fix an issue when they find one.\u201d\nThe DFI will operate like the fund itself, via crowd voting on proposals. Token holders will be able to propose solutions to potential security issues, and developers will be able to submit implementation proposals, which will be assessed by token holders. \n\u201cToo often do otherwise-competent teams mistakenly view security as something binary, as opposed to dynamic and in need of constant refinement,\u201d explained the Vega founders. \u201cThe DAO\u2019s team was warned far prior to the exploit that there was an issue in the code, but they failed to act. With this system, token holders can vote to fund a solution as soon as possible after finding an issue.\nIn a typical open-source project, anyone can propose changes, but it is up to the project managers to decide on acceptance. Here, the code is managed by the same DAO software infrastructure that manages the fund, so a change with enough support from the token-holders will be implemented.\nBeyond Funding the Platform\n\u201cWe no longer plan on having a presale as we\u2019ve received sufficient private funding interest to cover our development needs,\u201d Russell told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe believe this will be the better route to go so that we can launch with a fully developed platform before taking in any community money.\u201d\nRussell explained that any project that seeks to raise money via an ICO (i.e., sale of an Ethereum-based token) could be part of Vega Fund. \u201cThis could be anything from a decentralized social network to a brick-and-mortar clothing store, so long as they seek funding via tokens,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only recently garnered a lot of attention and as such we\u2019ve yet to have people come to us for funding,\u201d continued Russell. \u201cHowever, we\u2019ve been constantly interfacing with enthusiastic members of the community who\u2019ve been interested in this type of platform for a long time. So while we\u2019ve yet to have companies/projects come to us, that\u2019s OK, because we believe the community interest and optimism we\u2019ve received is more important at this early stage while we seek feedback and attempt to refine our core concepts.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 7}

Canada is already ranked third in the world behind the United States and the United Kingdom in its number of blockchain startups.\nIn recognition of the potential economic benefits of promoting blockchain and other innovative technologies, the Canadian Security Administrators (CSA) have launched a \u201cRegulatory Sandbox Initiative\u201d to mentor and work with new startups in a relatively regulation-free environment. The CSA is an umbrella organization for all the provincial and territorial securities regulatory agencies across the country.\n\u201cThe CSA\u2019s initiative is a clear answer to the increasing number of businesses interested in using innovative products, services and applications all across Canada,\u201d Sylvain Th\u00e9berge, a representative from the CSA, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe want to encourage all eligible startups to contact their local securities regulator, which will consider its eligibility and refer it to the CSA regulatory sandbox if it provides genuine technological innovation to contribute to the local and national economy.\u201d\n\u201cThis type of sandbox program is exactly what blockchain and digital currency companies need,\u201d Kyle Kemper, executive director of the advocacy group Blockchain Association of Canada, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe importance of this should not be understated. The regulators understand that they need to work with innovators to understand the technology, the implications, the threats and, more importantly, the opportunities.\u201d\n \nHe noted that compliance regimes and standards are struggling to keep up with the volume of data, which makes it difficult for all parties to operate effectively. \u201cThe sandbox approach is a great way for the regulators to support innovators while also becoming innovators themselves.\u201d\nThe CSA has already received applications from startups that don\u2019t mind working with the government to get the regulatory environment right without tying their hands in a competitive international market.\nJoseph Weinberg, co-founder and CEO of Paycase and a Blockchain Association of Canada board member, told Bitcoin Magazine:\n\u201cThis partnership for us is incredibly important. As financial services companies, we face the realities of having to navigate this financial terrain that is largely based on traditional systems that operate in fundamentally different ways. Our ecosystem has had many challenges, from getting bank accounts to proper payment processing and more.\u201d \n\u201cAny blockchain company that is working on projects that involve KYC, AML and securities compliance should be interested,\u201d added Kemper. \u201cThese could include exchanges, brokers, payment solutions, new blockchains, remittance firms, companies looking to ICO, identity solution providers, MSBs, reg tech providers, to name a few.\u201d \u00a0\n \nAccording to Lise Estelle Brault, CSA senior director of Derivatives Oversight, it is important to establish common standards across the country and to protect investors:\n\u201cRegulators have a key role to play in providing legal certainty around the implementation of any new market practices, some of which may cross jurisdictional borders. In the future, regulators could be tasked with ensuring the soundness of the governance built into code and turning the increased transparency into tangible intelligence on market stability.\u201d\nBrault acknowledged the challenge facing the CSA, which needs the IT infrastructure, appropriately trained staff and the \u201corganizational agility\u201d to successfully work in a rapidly changing technology market.\nThe Regulatory Sandbox Initiative is also open to other new innovative technologies including artificial intelligence and online crowdfunding portals.\n \nOntario Securities Commission\u2019s LaunchPad\nThe Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) was the first provincial agency to create a \u201csafe space\u201d for blockchain startups with its OSC LaunchPad program. It has already met with interested startups to strategize ways to test the marketplace without the usual rules and regulations.\nWeinberg, whose company, Paycase, is a participant in LaunchPad, observed that it is important to keep discussions with the government as a two-way street, educating and fact-checking to ensure that regulators and government organizations have the best information and the right technology solutions. \nThe OSC LaunchPad program recently signed an agreement with the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), allowing both agencies to refer startups to each other and help new firms navigate in each other\u2019s regulatory regimes. \n\u201cThe CSA Regulatory Sandbox is a great example of collaboration among securities regulators to provide a harmonized approach to fintech businesses across Canada,\" said\u00a0Pat Chaukos, chief of the OSC LaunchPad.\u00a0\"The OSC LaunchPad team will work with our CSA colleagues to share our experiences and expertise to react to the unique needs of these innovative business models.\u201d\nWeinberg \u00a0said that he appreciates the efforts of the Canadian government to ensure new innovative technologies are not hamstrung by outdated regulations. \n\u201cThrough initiatives being taken by the blockchain community in Canada, in collaboration with all levels of government, regulators and financial institutions, we have created an environment that is based on collaboration instead of competition, and cooperation instead of collision,\u201d he noted. \u201cOur companies, alliances and bodies of government are paving the way to rapid transformation across all systems of our economy.\n\u201cThe more we can help our regulators and government bodies understand how they (blockchain, cryptocurrencies) work, the faster we can build a more prosperous economy in Canada and create more Canadian companies that compete at the global level.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 7}

It details how Qtum\u2019s blockchain will allow for mobile usability, how it will be able to interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine to enable smart contract execution and how smart contract lifecycle management will be applied to improve security by allowing smart-contract collaboration, negotiation, review, and tracking.\nThe Qtum blockchain will allow lite wallets running on mobile phone devices to interact with DApps and smart contracts. It will support the simple payment verification (SPV) protocol so that transactions can be signed using a mobile device and Internet of Things devices can also be operated and integrated using smart contracts. \nQtum\u2019s Account Abstraction Layer will allow interaction between the Ethereum Virtual Machine and the Qtum\u2019s UXTO-based Blockchain and other potential virtual machines in the future. Also, by using a UTXO platform, smart contracts are given more functionalities, flexibility and traceability, compared to pure Ethereum-based smart contracts. \n\u201cQtum aims to revolutionize business processes and the way that business interact with their customers by making smart contract technology mobile and practical. The SPV protocol allows smart contracts to move from servers and laptops, into IoT and mobile devices,\u201d said Earls.\nThe whitepaper also addresses potential security concerns, which were highlighted due to the Ethereum DAO compromise of last year. Qtum will use Smart-Contract Lifecycle Management which allows for the collaboration, reviewing, negotiation, and the tracking of smart contracts across organizations by all parties to establish trust through active security vetting. \nSupporting a Stable Project Governance Structure\nPwC has also supported Qtum in creating its new project governance structure, which will allow Qtum to become one of the largest open-source distributed ledger projects that can meet the requirements of a broad range of industries, such as financial services, supply chain management, gaming, social media, Internet of Things, and more. \n\u201cPwC has helped the Qtum Foundation setting up our governance model, project management, and risk management,\u201d Qtum co-founder Patrick Dai told Bitcoin Magazine. \n\u201cIn the future we plan on expanding our cooperation with PwC to help Qtum expand our reach and adoption of blockchain technology,\u201d\nCY Cheung, Fintech and Cybersecurity Partner of PwC China stated: \"PwC sees enormous potential for blockchain to revolutionize business practices as we know them, and the firm has made great efforts in developing strategic and technical capabilities to adapt existing products and services for the new technology. We are excited to get involved in the era of innovation and help companies capture the opportunities and benefits brought by the new technology. Working with the Qtum Foundation aligns with our goal.\" \nThe next step for the Qtum project will be conducting an initial coin offering to fund the further development of the platform. After the crowd sale, further testing of the Qtum blockchain will be conducted before the platform will go live. \n\u201cOur crowd sale starts on March 16th, and afterwards the next steps for Qtum will be to complete the testnet from the Qtum test net, receive feedback from the community on testing, and then to launch the mainnet of the Qtum blockchain,\u201d Earls told Bitcoin Magazine.", "year": 2017, "month": 3, "day": 7}

The original Alliance was founded in 2013 by Anthony Di Iorio, who stepped down from his role in 2015.\n\u201cOur mandate is to educate, drive awareness and foster a dialogue between businesses, thought leaders and policy makers to ensure that Canada continues to be a leading nation for blockchain technology innovation,\u201d Kyle Kemper, current executive director of the new Blockchain Association of Canada (BAC), told Bitcoin Magazine. \n\u201cThere is an incredible, thriving scene here that keeps growing,\u201d said BAC board member and Outlier Solutions CEO Amber D.

During the recent board of directors election, Eagar said:\n\u201cThere is still much work to do around merchant adoption, friendlier user experience, regulatory clarification, the opening of bank accounts for BTC startups and trading accounts around the world, closing the gap between innovation and regulatory roadblocks.\u201d\nScott concurred: \u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous that innovative Canadian businesses find themselves unable to access the Canadian banking system.

And yet, while an increasing number of industries are undertaking various experiments to understand the benefits that DLT can provide, a new report from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has warned that new regulations for blockchain technology would be \u201cpremature\u201d at this stage of its development.\nThis new report comes after ESMA issued a discussion paper titled \u201cThe Distributed Ledger Technology Applied to Securities Markets\u201d last June for a public consultation on blockchain technology.\nHowever, while the future of regulations surrounding the technology has been left open, the securities regulator is taking a cautionary approach to the technology in the new report, under the same title.\n\u201cAt this stage, ESMA believes that it is premature to fully appreciate the changes that the technology could bring and the regulatory response that may be needed, given that the technology is still evolving and practical applications are limited both in number and scope,\u201d ESMA said.\n\nIn 2013, the regulator first began considering digital currencies, and in 2015, it started to ascertain whether blockchain technology could enter the financial sector.\nHowever, while ESMA is keen to understand the benefits and risks that blockchain technology may bring to the securities markets and how it maps to existing EU regulation, the regulator notes that any large-scale use of DLT first needs to overcome several challenges before the benefits it could bring can materialize. These challenges include interoperability and the use of common standards, access to central bank money, governance and privacy issues, and scalability.\nThe report states that as DLT is still at an early stage of its development, it remains unclear if the technology will overcome any of these challenges.\nYet, despite the trials facing the technology, ESMA believes that the likely first targets of DLT will focus on enhancing processes under the current market structure. It also thinks that early applications will pay attention to less automated processes in low-volume market segments that have minimum dependency on the existing legal framework.\nOf course, ESMA\u2019s role is to ensure that the regulatory framework provides relevant safeguards to investor protection, financial stability and orderly markets. It\u2019s keen, therefore, to maintain that those in support of the technology and those developing it should be aware of existing rules when designing blockchain solutions.\n\u201cThe presence of DLT does not liberate users from complying with the existing regulatory framework, which provides important safeguards for the well-functioning of financial markets,\u201d ESMA said. \u201cBeyond pure financial regulation, broader legal issues, such as corporate law, contract law, insolvency law or competition law, may impact on the deployment of DLT.\u201d\nDespite the growth of blockchain technology and the potential redundant processes that the technology may produce, the EU regulatory body doesn\u2019t believe that financial market infrastructures such as central securities depositories (CSDs) or central counterparties (CCPs) will cease to exist anytime soon.\nIt did indicate, however, that it may move to create a regulatory framework in the future, asking for active engagement from regulators and coordination at the EU and international levels to work toward addressing the challenges the technology faces.\n\u201cESMA will continue to monitor market developments around DLT to assess whether a regulatory response may be needed.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 9}

Over 200 senior-level financial services and technology decision makers across the U.S., U.K. and Europe were interviewed for this survey. The outcome of the survey suggests that the vast majority of financial institutions believe in the potential of blockchain technology and that it will be in everyday use in the financial industry within the next 10 years.\nOf the surveyed correspondents, 94 percent believe that boards have bought into the idea of developing blockchain technology projects, while 87 percent also believe that they have the budget to implement them. One of the biggest challenges for blockchain adoption in the financial industry that has been identified by the surveyed is the lack of human resources needed to implement large-scale blockchain projects. Of the senior-level financial services professionals surveyed, 70 percent believe that their institutions currently do not have the right talent to properly implement the distributed ledger technology. \nFurthermore, the survey indicates that over two-thirds (67.4 percent) of financial institutions are currently involved in blockchain initiatives while close to one in five (16.7 percent) institutions have already identified use cases for the distributed ledger technology. Know Your Customer (KYC), trade finance and global payments are the most cited areas of implementation. And 15 percent stated that they have already developed blockchain pilot systems, while nearly one in four institutions are part of a working group to find blockchain-based business solutions. \nChallenges for Blockchain Adoption in Financial Services\nThe perceived challenges for widespread blockchain adoption in financial services are focused on two key areas: regulatory requirements and technological limitations. \nAlmost one in four of the surveyed financial services professionals stated that they are waiting for clear regulatory guidance on distributed ledger technology before making business decisions regarding this technology. \nThe issue of interoperability among individual institutions\u2019 blockchains was noted as a chief concern for 29.3 percent of the respondents; 20.9 percent had privacy concerns about using blockchains, and another 20.5 percent highlighted the issue of blockchain scalability as their number-one concern. \n \nSynechron CEO Faisal Husain commented on the survey results, stating: \u201cIt is clear that many financial services firms are either seriously considering how to utilize blockchain [technology] within their organization or are already putting this technology into practice.\u201d \nHe further added: \u201cHowever, with any new technology there are challenges to be overcome. Our survey shows that recruiting the right people is one such challenge, regulation is another and technical considerations related to the technology itself another.\u201d\nSynechron\u2019s survey clearly indicates that the financial industry has accepted that blockchains will play an integral role in its future. However, the survey has also highlighted that the technical challenges of blockchain implementation means that it will take several years before widespread adoption can take place.", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 9}

It is also rapidly emerging as a burgeoning hotbed for blockchain technology, known for its disruptive potential in creating innovative solutions for the world of business and commerce.\nIn recent months, robust activity on the part of Scotland\u2019s blockchain community has ignited a flurry of activity and a bright outlook. In fact, the pace of advancement is moving along at a fast clip, delivering meaningful use cases and promising business solutions to the cause.\nSCOTEX, the blockchain-powered stock exchange expected to launch this year is arguably the biggest example of the momentum taking place in Scotland. Supported by a consortium of \u00a0ex-NASDAQ and Scottish investors seeking to raise over $18.4 million (\u00a315 million) for the project, it could become the first independent exchange in the country since the early seventies.\nBy integrating blockchain technology, SCOTEX will allow for the clearing of all trades instantly, eliminating the need for an often costly clearinghouse. It is expected that stakeholders will receive settlements within 15 minutes of trade execution, a process that in conventional financial exchanges can take anywhere between two to three days.\nThis adoption of blockchain technology on the part of existing stock exchanges is not a new thing. Exchanges such as the Australian Securities Exchange, NASDAQ and others have already created blockchain-based trade-settlement systems that serve as a model to work from. \nWhat\u2019s somewhat unique about SCOTEX, however, is that it will be the first stock exchange to utilize distributed ledger technology from its inception. This will allow it to serve as an interesting test balloon in terms of blockchain technology\u2019s long-term viability and utility in the global financial arena. \nAnother signal of Scotland\u2019s accelerated interest in the blockchain space was the November 2016 ScotChain16 event in Edinburgh. This well-attended event brought together business leaders and entrepreneurially minded blockchain enthusiasts from across the globe. The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), which hosted the event, is among 36 banks globally that are testing blockchain technology\u2019s utility for commercial paper transactions.\nFlocking to Blockchain Technology\nScotland is also seeing fervent startup activity targeting blockchain use cases. One new entrant to this arena is the full-spectrum digital design consultancy known as Flockchain. Founded in May 2016 and based in Glasgow, the firm assists public and private organizations with integrating blockchain technology toward their UX, cybersecurity and strategic goals.\nAccording to CEO and Co-Founder Phil Doyle, Flockchain\u2019s initial focus is centered around technical and market research aimed at identifying strong blockchain use cases across various market sectors. He says that Flockchain hatched in May 2016 after he and Co-Founder David Kidd had discussed the merits of blockchain and distributed ledger technology at length for weeks, reading and watching everything they could get their hands on. Excited by the potential of blockchains, they decided to pursue a strategy for promoting awareness of the technology while raising the industry\u2019s profile.\nSays Doyle: \u201cWe are working to accelerate the adoption of blockchain [technology] through training programs that deliver a pipeline of skilled developers into the industry, engaging with government and business to demonstrate value and stimulate buying. Flockchain is excited to be forging strategic partnerships with key organizations to meet these challenges.\u201d \nDoyle describes the blockchain community as highly active and engaged in exploring new possibilities. \u201cWe ourselves started attending the monthly Scottish Blockchain Meetup in Edinburgh where there are lots of excellent projects and startups being presented to enthusiastic turnouts.\u201d\n \nHe also says that there is a lot of cross-pollination with the U.K. \u201cWe\u2019ve in fact been doing our own research on the landscape of blockchain [technology] in the U.K. and have discovered that there is a lack of skills in the market to drive many blockchain projects forward. There is also a general lack of awareness of what [a] blockchain is and how it can transform business and government.\u201d \nOne bright note about Scotland, Doyle says, is that the government has a progressive policy structure around new technologies. And with the country having a highly developed tech sector with a particular focus on the Internet of Things (IoT) and data science, he says that blockchains fit very nicely within that landscape. \nPaul Forrest, Chairman of Glasgow-based MBN Solutions \u2014 a leading people solutions, recruitment and search enterprise for blockchain and other sectors \u2014 says that the technology is high on the agenda for Scotland\u2019s business and technology communities. He says that this interest is not just limited to use cases and applications in and around the fintech arena. \u201cWe have already seen ab initio ventures from the world of healthcare and the legal sector set out their stalls in Scotland to explore the prospects of exploiting Scotland\u2019s mature and well-staffed technology, data and cryptosecurity expertise.\u201d \nIn 2017 he sees many new ventures capitalizing on Scotland\u2019s strengths around data science and healthcare, and anticipates further progress in and around payments and identity management, based on activities disclosed by the likes of the country\u2019s financial services heavyweights.\nConcludes Forrest: \u201cFor Scotland to succeed as a center of blockchain excellence it is critical that use cases continue to mature and that build capability continues to grow. Bringing these two pillars together will support the creation of a rich skills environment fueled by a genuine appreciation for the art of the possible and thus place Scotland at the heart of the future of blockchain [technology].\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 9}

The vast majority of purchases are illegal drugs, but weapons, stolen credit card details and other illegal goods are traded as well.\u00a0\nSince pioneering darknet market Silk Road was closed down in 2013, and founder Ross Ulbricht sentenced to life in prison, buying and selling of illegal contraband has only increased. \nShipment of the illegal goods is exclusively done by mail. In most cases, at least in the United Stated, this is done with USPS. As a federal agency, USPS is bound by the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution. This prevents the postal service from inspecting packages without a warrant, attaining which in turn requires probable cause. Providing this probable cause is \u2014 presumably \u2014 where the investigative analyst would come in.\nThat said, even now, the mailing system is probably the weakest link in darknet market operations.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nTumbleBit is probably one of the most promising technological advancements built on top of Bitcoin to date. Not only does it offer one of the best \u2014 if not the best \u2014 privacy related innovations so far, it can also provide significant scaling benefits as a payment hub. The solution is also fully compatible with the current Bitcoin protocol and, most important, it is in an advanced stage of development.\n\u201cThe prospect is good that before summer we will have software that regular users can safely use,\u201d one of TumbleBit\u2019s inventors, Ethan Heilman, told Bitcoin Magazine.\nNTumbleBit\nTumbleBit has made a good deal of progress in little time. The idea was first proposed last summer by Heilman, Leen AlShenibr, Foteini Baldimtsi, Alessandra Scafuro and Sharon Goldberg. The group of university researchers also coded up a proof of concept and even made successful test transactions on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. Shortly after, in September, Heilman and AlShenibr presented their proposal at Scaling Bitcoin Milan, where it was very well received: enthusiasts even made two different trailers celebrating the innovation.\nInspired by its potential, author of the book \u201cProgramming The Blockchain in C#\u201d and NBitcoin developer Nicolas Dorier started working on his own implementation of TumbleBit in the C# programming language, called NTumbleBit.\n\u201cHis work is very impressive, so we decided to move over to it, and NTumbleBit is now the official TumbleBit implementation,\u201d Heilman explained. \u201cMuch progress has been made over the past months, and we are now working to ensure that the software is as secure as it can be, and as tested as it can be. We are also building the operational tools necessary for it to be deployed in production.\u201d\nTumbleBit merges several cryptographic tricks to allow for a completely trustless coin mixing service. In \u201cClassic Tumbler mode,\u201d all users connect through a central TumbleBit server and send coins to one another in such a way that everyone receives as much as they sent. Using a series of clever cryptographic tricks, this is done so no one can steal coins and no one knows who\u2019s sending bitcoins to whom, not even the central server. Hundreds of users can participate at the same time, thereby obfuscating blockchain trails and, in turn, vastly improving Bitcoin privacy for everyone involved.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Dorier explained how this is done with his NTumbleBit implementation.\n\u201cUsers will need to use a Bitcoin Core full node as a wallet; pruning mode is fine, so they don\u2019t need to store the entire blockchain,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, the NTumbleBit client slowly drains all the coins from the wallet, and connects to the NTumbleBit server to mix them. Completely different coins are returned to the user, preferably to an HD public key for light wallets, though the Bitcoin Core wallet is an option too. The whole process can take a couple of hours depending on the amount to mix, but then everyone will have a completely different batch of coins.\u201d\nDorier completed a first iteration of the NBitcoin software and has stepped back from active development.\nUsability\nNow, others are picking up where Dorier left off.\nAs an important next step, the co-author of Dorier\u2019s C# Bitcoin book, Fics\u00f3r \u00c1d\u00e1m, traveled to Tokyo \u2014 where Dorier lives \u2014 to help with Tor integration. \nAnonymizing through Tor may be needed to ensure that the NTumbleBit server can operate as a hidden service. Not all regulators will be very happy with the existence of such a coin mixing tool, and it is possible TumbleBit server operators may encounter trouble when providing the service. (This is also one of the reasons Dorier hasn\u2019t tested the implementation on main net himself, and is instead sticking to testnet.)\nBut Tor integration is also very much required for TumbleBit to work as advertised, at least in Classic Tumbler mode, \u00c1d\u00e1m explained.\n\u201cIn Classic Tumbler mode, everyone is effectively sending bitcoins to themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone receives new bitcoins, so it breaks the blockchain links. But if everyone communicates with the TumbleBit server through their own IP addresses, that server can easily re-establish the link: it can simply link the IP addresses of sending and receiving Bitcoin addresses and conclude it\u2019s the same person. That\u2019s solved with Tor.\u201d\nAnd then, of course, TumbleBit must actually be made usable \u2014 and not only usable for command-line techies, but for regular users as well. After all, the greater the number of people who use TumbleBit, the greater the number of Bitcoin addresses that get mixed together. This increases the anonymity set and therefore benefits everyone\u2019s privacy, including that of command-line techies. \nThis step is being realized by Dan Gould. An undergraduate at Boston University, Gould is working on a graphic user interface for NTumbleBit. This user interface should make mixing coins with TumbleBit as easy as clicking a button.\nAll in all, Heilman expects that the first working and usable release of NTumbleBit may be available within months.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say with certainty, but many of the pieces are in place, and there should be even more people working on NTumbleBit in March, including myself and Leen,\u201d he said.\nPayment Hub\nFinally, TumbleBit is capable of more than just increasing privacy. \nTumbleBit in Classic Tumbler mode may be the best mixing solution for Bitcoin so far (ValueShuffle is another candidate). But in \u201cPayment Hub mode,\u201d a TumbleBit server can, indeed, act as a payment hub. Not unlike the lightning network, this allows users to transact with other users \u201coff-chain\u201d for an extended period of time. If both a customer and a merchant are connected to the TumbleBit server, for example, the customer can make a payment in bitcoin, while neither the customer nor the merchant (nor the tumbler) learn anything about each other\u2019s Bitcoin addresses.\n\u201cWhile we have no timelines yet, we are definitely building Payment Hub mode as well,\u201d Heilman acknowledged. \u201cBut our first goal is Classic Tumbler mode; that is 95 percent of the work from a coding perspective.\u201d\nAnd, as with so many of Bitcoin\u2019s tech innovations, TumbleBit could also benefit from Segregated Witness (\u201cSegWit\u201d). The protocol upgrade proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team would solve Bitcoin\u2019s long-standing malleability bug; however, adoption of the proposal currently seems uncertain.\n\u201cSegWit is an across-the-board win for anything doing anything with payment channels,\u201d Heilman said. \u201cThe biggest advantages are for TumbleBit in Payment Hub mode, as it would allow for more flexibility in payments and an overall smoother user experience. If SegWit happens, then some of the research I'm working on now to improve TumbleBit will happen on Bitcoin. If SegWit doesn't happen, TumbleBit will still happen exactly as we planned, but my further research will probably target Litecoin or other coins with malleability fixes.\u201d\nFor more on TumbleBit, read \u201cWith TumbleBit, Bitcoin Mixing May Have Found Its Winning Answer.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 10}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe price collapse of \u201cblack gold\u201d locked Nigerians into their economy. Now, \u201cdigital gold\u201d is providing some Nigerians with a way out.\nOnly three years ago, crude oil cost over $100 a barrel. But that peak came tumbling down. Throughout 2014 and 2015, oil prices took an almost unprecedented plunge to the $30 range, and is currently trading around $50 a barrel. As the lifeblood of Africa\u2019s largest economy, Nigerian income from exports plunged with it.\nFaced with dwindling foreign currency reserves, Nigeria\u2019s central bank was quick to impose capital controls. Whole industries were banned from importing goods; the Nigerian president wanted businesses to buy their products from domestic suppliers. Instead, this policy led to widespread shortages of raw materials, machine parts and supermarket products. Additionally, foreign currency\u2013denominated Nigerian bank cards had strict spending limits imposed, preventing Nigerians from shopping abroad or paying overseas school fees.\nNigeria initially refused to devalue its currency, the naira (NGN), which was pegged to the U.S. dollar. However, that led to black market rates for U.S. dollars, increasing to levels almost double that of the official figures. As of June 2016, the naira exchange rate was finally allowed to float. As a result, the national currency fell by about 40 over the last year, according to official figures.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Bitcoin is gaining ground.\nTim Akinbo is a 35-year-old software developer and Bitcoin enthusiast from Nigeria, and the only person in West Africa running a full node.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been quite some interest in bitcoin use in Nigeria recently,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely growing. The devaluation of the national currency is an obvious reason, as bitcoin serves as a hedge in that respect. But companies have also started to use bitcoin for imports. Either through companies like BitPesa, or individually. And Nigerians in the diaspora also increasingly use bitcoin to send money to their family and friends at home.\u201d\nThis observation is perhaps best reflected in the increase in Nigerian trading volume on LocalBitcoins.com. This has regularly topped 400 million NGN ($1.2 million) per week, more than the entire eurozone combined. Moreover, the bitcoin exchange rate even reached some 500,000 NGN ($1,600) on Nigerian exchanges recently; similar premiums were previously seen in other countries faced with capital controls or monetary woes, like China and India.\nOther figures show similar trends. Of all countries, Nigeria tops the Google trend charts for most \u201cBitcoin\u201d searches. Asked by Bitcoin Magazine, several wallet providers \u2014 including Mycelium, Bitcoin Wallet, Breadwallet and BTC.com \u2014 reported significant relative growth in downloads from the African country: new installs in some cases increased around 2000% since October. And as another indicator of success, Africa-focused Bitcoin startup BitPesa secured a $2.5 million funding round from leading venture capital firms only last week.\nAlejandro De La Torre is the business development manager for Bitcoin wallet provider BTC.com, and speaking to Bitcoin Magazine he confirmed this sentiment.\n\u201cWallet downloads from Nigeria were only topped by the United States and India. For a developing country that\u2019s not known to be very tech savvy, with relative high illiteracy, and that has less inhabitants than countries like China, Indonesia or Brazil, that had us very surprised,\u201d De La Torre told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe\u2019re now in the process of setting up a meetup in Lagos, which already has 130 members signed up in three weeks. I think Bitcoin interest in Nigeria is growing exponentially.\u201d\nThe MMM Ponzi Scheme\nThough, it seems there\u2019s also a significantly more depressing explanation for the Bitcoin surge.\nUnfortunately, a largely illiterate populace hit with an economic downturn proved a fertile breeding ground for large-scale Ponzi schemes. The most famous of these, MMM, swept through several African countries over the past couple of years, including South Africa, Zimbabwe and \u2014 indeed \u2014 Nigeria. Similar, perhaps even bigger schemes, have been \u201csuccessful\u201d in Nigeria, too.\n\u201cPeople were promised incredible returns on their investment if they\u2019d put their money in these pyramid schemes,\u201d Akinbo said. \u201cAnd a couple months ago, some of these schemes introduced the option to fund and receive payments with bitcoin. Unfortunately \u2014 or fortunately depending on how you see it \u2014 a number of these schemes went bust toward the end of the year. A lot of people lost money in these schemes, and the few Ponzis that survived aren\u2019t doing so well.\u201d\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, financial regulators in Nigeria have started to take note as well. In a letter from the Nigerian central bank, addressed at financial institutions and virtual currency operations, bitcoin is listed in one breath with MLM scheme OneCoin. The central bank warned it may \u201caddress the Money Laundering / Terrorism Financing (ML/TF) risks associated with [digital currency] exchanges,\u201d in order to \u201cprotect the integrity of the Nigerian financial system.\u201d\nRegardless, Akinbo remains optimistic.\n\u201cWhile these Ponzi schemes were bad news, they did expose many Nigerians to bitcoin for the first time. Bitcoin took a slight dip in trading volume and price but surprisingly continued to trade even after the demise of a number of the major schemes. I think we will see these Ponzi schemes disappear over time, while bitcoin might just stick around \u2026\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 10}

The company plans to implement a full end-to-end \"execution to custody\" pilot in 2017.\n \nFounded in 2015 by CEO Nicholas Bone, a former banker who has served at the Bank of England, Deutsche Bank, BNY Mellon and most recently Standard Chartered PLC, EquiChain is building a global capital markets infrastructure platform.\n \nBy leveraging blockchain technology, EquiChain\u2019s patent-pending solution enables the direct interaction and exchange of value between incumbent market participants without the current need for multiple touchpoints and the inefficient interaction of different systems. It further creates a verifiable, transparent and immutable flow of information, enabling the streamlining of market processes.\n \n\u201cThe current securities transaction lifecycle is complex, costly, time-consuming and fraught with risk,\u201d Bone said in a statement. \u201cEquiChain will use distributed ledger technology (DLT) to redefine securities transaction flows creating a full \u2018execution to custody\u2019 capability. EquiChain\u2019s core platform is an independent, flexible foundational technology that allows incumbent market participants to redefine their roles in the industry. [It] will catalyze industry collaboration to define a new capital markets operating model.\u201d\n \nAccording to a study by Oliver Wyman, banks' IT and operations expenditure in capital markets totals $100\u2013150 billion a year, with a further $100 billion spent on post-trade and securities servicing fees. Blockchain technology could help reduce the cost of providing securities services by more than 30 percent.\n \nFocus on Emerging Markets\n \nSupported by the Abu Dhabi Global Market, Bahrain Bourse and the Qatar Stock Exchange, EquiChain said it will focus on enhancing the investment viability of emerging and frontier markets, beginning with the Middle East.\n \n\u201cBlockchain [technology] is particularly relevant for emerging and frontier markets, which are often perceived by foreign investors as being higher risk, while typically having less cumbersome existing infrastructure to accommodate,\u201d said Bone, adding that blockchain technology could give these markets the opportunity to leapfrog existing solutions.\n \nMarkus Ruetimann, senior advisor to the EquiChain board and the former group chief operating officer of U.K.-based asset management company Schroders, noted that accessing frontier and emerging markets poses many operational challenges. EquiChain\u2019s solution will make these markets more accessible for investment, whilst reinforcing local infrastructure, he said.\n \nAlongside Ruetimann, EquiChain\u2019s advisory board includes former Standard Chartered bankers Peter Sands and Sonia Rossetti, as well as Eva Micheler, an associate professor of law at the London School of Economics.\n \nTechnology threatens to disrupt the market as a whole and that disruption may be coming sooner than many think. Last year, Deutsche Bank conducted a survey which found that of 200 financial market participants, three-quarters see blockchain technology being widely used within the next three to six years. Over 80 percent expect distributed ledger and blockchain technologies to have a major impact on the market for securities services.\n \nEquiChain has also announced the closing of its initial funding round.

The characteristics, including its inherent distributed nature, trustless consensus mechanisms and reliability, as well as the fact that it makes data publicly available, have made banking institutions around the world eager to change their backend systems to use blockchain technology.\nBlockchain technology\u2019s high efficiency, low costs and high security have been discussed and explored by various industry experts and intellectuals. This globally recognized disruptive new technology is continuously being examined,researched and applied to create new business models and regulatory services with cooperative thinking. Its globally efficient cooperation method has been bringing the cost of verification and trust down to a minimum.\n \nCooperative Trust Service\nCooperation is not a new idea. In agricultural societies, farmers typically ask for the help of their neighbors, whether for advice or manual labor. After working together, the bounty of everyone\u2019s efforts gets distributed. This type of employment relationship is one of the simplest coordination mechanisms, resulting in everybody benefiting and sharing resources. Cooperation solves many fundamental problems regarding productivity, distribution and consensus of a group. At the same time, this collaboration allows us to discover potential benefits of shared work and promotes institutional change.\nIndustrial societies cooperate differently compared to agricultural societies. A factory, for example, does not have to produce all the components. Management can focus on purchasing and delegate complete workflow procedures to a professional company through to final assembly. Throughout these processes, rules and systems are necessary to coordinate and balance developed societies. Together these fundamentals promote efficiency, trust and trade. Coordination and collaboration become structural elements and support forward progress in industries. Working in unison leads to more market strength and adaptability.\nKnowledge is the next paradigm in trust and collaboration. Providing additional verifiable and transparent information leads to greater cooperation and self-discipline. Blockchain technology can be used to solve collaborative problems. A blockchain trust service platform can be utilized instead of older methods involving high-cost intermediary trust providers, and thus lower the costs of goods and services.\nIf the ideas of multiple cooperative organizations can be agreed upon by consensus, many global issues may be solved. \nThe Cost of Trust\nPaul Zak, an economics professor at Claremont University in California, found that trust encourages investment and can reduce transaction fees. In societies where there are low levels of financial and organizational trust, a large proportion of the population will have a lower economic standing. \nLooking at the European economy, various surveys show that more than 70 percent of Germans no longer have trust in the Euro market and a staggering 40 percent of Germans would rather have Marks back in their wallets. However, if they were to switch back to Marks, according to the Swiss Bank Corporation, Germany would lose \u20ac6,000\u20138,000 per person in the first year, which would equal to a GDP decrease of 20\u201325 percent. After the initial downturn, a further \u20ac3,500\u20134,500 loss per person would be expected in the following years. \nSimilarly, if Greece or other weak economically performing countries exited the European Union, they could also expect their residents to sustain losses of \u20ac9,500\u201311,500 per year. During the same time frame, overall GDP would decrease 40\u201350 percent. Since last year, the British Pound has lost over 15 percent of its value compared to the dollar, and an exit from the European Union is still not certain.\nIt is possible that in the next few years, due to ongoing economic instability and eroding trust in the financial sector, that we could see banks and international trading systems crash. The world\u2019s oldest operating bank, Italy's Monte dei Paschi di Siena, was recently bailed out by Italy to prevent its failure. Additionally, sovereign debt and both business and personal bankruptcy-filing increases could potentially lead to losses of \u20ac3,000\u20134,000 per person. Swiss Bank analysts believe that a one-time assistance payment of \u20ac1,000 per person may be a better solution than the current practices being put forward in debt crises.\nFood Trust Crisis\nAfter a tainted milk powder incident in China, the dairy industry encountered an unprecedented loss of consumer confidence, which came at a high cost to the Mengniu Group. Due to this lack of trust in milk products and affiliated companies, the industry has been forced to spend additional funds to improve consumer confidence.\nMengniu sales and distribution costs in 2007 totaled over 3.302 billion yuan and in 2008 topped 4.428 billion yuan. The cost of advertising and promotion grew by 2.1 percent to 9.3 percent. A significant portion of advertising funds went to rebuilding consumer trust. This incident may have happened many years ago; nevertheless, the dairy industry is still having to pay for additional advertising to keep consumer trust. \nAt times, world governments and global markets seem to be operating with two opposing systems. After many years of incompatibilities between markets and governments, we are starting to move out of the industrial age of the \u201cus vs. them\u201d method of thinking and are starting to use a multidimensional approach. This new approach focuses on establishing multiple collaborative relationships between people.\n \nTrusted relationships are already in place and form connections between services on the internet just as they do in real life. However, the older trust-based systems are slow and require manual input. Blockchain technology improves the trust-transfer efficiency and lowers transaction costs. Using blockchains, we can solve the problem of trust verification and increase efficiency so that future transactions are seamless and efficient. \nBlockchain technology has already been proven reliable, and the technology enables parties to provide confidence together in many different operations. Blockchains can keep business support costs low while still achieving the highest efficiency to achieve the ultimate goal.\nBlockchain Technology in the Supply Chain\nOne area where we will continue to see blockchain technology grow in is the supply chain. Supply chains involve multiple stakeholders and industries such as suppliers, manufacturers and consumers, as well as huge multinational shipping and logistics companies, governments and financial institutions. Using blockchain technology to verify the product information and authenticity quickly can bring down the overall costs of trade and increase companies\u2019 turnover rates.\nIn the past, both government and enterprises alike have attempted to solve the problems of product traceability and anti-counterfeiting. While some degree of success may have been achieved, time has proven again and again that counterfeiters and criminals can thwart the current anti-counterfeiting efforts. \nPrevious efforts using intermediary verification agencies have brought on their own problems. An intermediary verification service is limited in the amount of data collected during manufacturing, quality assurance, shipping and at the point of sale. If data is not collected or if it is entered incorrectly at any point of the chain, the entire chain of trust becomes unreliable. \nBlockchain technology, as a distributed shared common database, radically reduces the cost of credibility and increases confidence in transactions. Previously, each step of the way toward the end users could potentially have incorrect information. Being able to verify quickly and without doubt that product quality control standards have been followed while at the same time being able to confirm shipping logistics, customs clearance and warehouse storage, blockchain technology removes many of the current hurdles involved in detailed, accurate record keeping. \n \nAt the same time, there are various complex, objective conditions that few enterprises can incorporate into their system modules. In the vast majority of cases, considering the cost, data security, maturity of upstream and downstream partners, IT systems and other objective conditions make it hard to obtain information from one location. They have to sacrifice efficiency and data consistency to achieve an \u201coperability balance\u201d in supply chain operations. \nBlockchain technology offers the potential to create a universal platform that retains data for every enterprise, allowing information to flow easily and securely. In the traditional business world, a different enterprise system between suppliers and producers can make for huge expenses. It\u2019s not unheard of for a vendor or producer to change their entire system to be compatible. However, a blockchain system like VeChain, for example, is designed to be an open, transparent system to achieve success across all market participants in both upstream and downstream stakeholders in the supply chain.\nInterfaces to relevant data can be tailored to each company\u2019s unique mandate to safeguard goods across all stages of the supply chain. Once the product reaches consumers, they only need to have an internet connection and a smartphone to receive complete, detailed and accurate information about their product, which also includes verification of its authenticity. \nBlockchain technology used in the three elements of the supply chain, starting with logistics, information and even capital, can increase productivity, tracking and information sharing. When developing a platform of trust with the VeChain mechanism, the new system greatly increases productivity all while lowering costs. Blockchain technology can even lead to new business models. \nImagine this fourth industrial revolution; the basis of blockchain technology paired with the Internet of Things (IoT) can make any number of parties able to see the entire production chain from beginning to end. Each party can obtain verifiable and reliable data by taking advantage of the blockchain, which will bring more efficient global workflows and a lower cost for coordination between enterprises. \nThat is the next chapter of blockchain technology.\nThis op-ed is a guest post by DJ Qian.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nSatoshi Nakamoto\u2019s math doesn\u2019t quite add up.\nIn chapter 11 of the Bitcoin white paper, the pseudonymous author explained that an honest mining majority will always outrun a dishonest minority. As a key innovation in digital currency, this ensures transactions are practically irreversible once they have sufficient confirmations, effectively solving the double-spend problem.\nHowever, as first explained by Israeli mathematician Meni Rosenfeld back in 2012, Satoshi made some simplified assumptions. While Bitcoin mining is a random process, Satoshi did not fully take into account that honest miners can be just as lucky or unlucky as dishonest miners can.\nCyril Grunspan, mathematician at \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure d'Ing\u00e9nieurs L\u00e9onard de Vinci, and Ricardo P\u00e9rez-Marco, mathematician at the French National Center for Scientific Research, now have taken this randomness into account. The two Parisians published a new paper, finally correcting Satoshi\u2019s \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\u201cSatoshi wrongly assumed that honest miners use exactly as much time to find a block as they would on average,\u201d Grunspan told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cHowever, this is actually a rough approximation of reality, since the time used by honest miners to mine a block is not deterministic. Therefore, the distribution of the number of blocks mined by the attacker is actually \u2014 what is called \u2014 a \u2018negative binomial distribution.\u2019 Not the assumed \u2018Poisson law.\u2019\u201d\nIn essence, the Bitcoin white paper assumes that two factors are needed to calculate how irreversible a transaction is. Satoshi rightly assumed that the share of total hash power available to the attacker is one factor: as an attacker controls more hash power, more confirmations are needed. And Satoshi rightfully assumed that the number of confirmations is another factor: the more confirmations a transaction has, the more secure it is.\nGrunspan and P\u00e9rez-Marco now show how a third factor comes into play: the deviation from average mining time \u2014 \u201cluck\u201d \u2014 the honest miners have in finding blocks. If they are very lucky, and find blocks faster than the average, their chain will probably be further ahead; the attacker will have had less time to secretly mine an alternative chain. On the other hand, if the honest miners are unlucky and find blocks slower than the average, they will probably be less far ahead: thus, the attacker will have had more time to mine an alternative chain.\nWhat This Means\nThe good news, as now conclusively shown by Grunspan and P\u00e9rez-Marco, is that the basic premise of the white paper still holds up. Bitcoin works as intended.\n\u201cIn this paper, we show that the probability of double spends drops exponentially to zero as the honest mining majority finds more blocks,\u201d Grunspan said. In other words, it becomes increasingly difficult for minority attackers to catch up and overtake the honest majority.\nThat said, the security assumptions as stated in the white paper need to be tweaked a little. Rather than just accounting for the amount of hash power an attacker has and the number of blocks the attacker is behind, this third factor must also be considered. In their paper, Grunspan and P\u00e9rez-Marco have now published exactly how much this matters.\n\u201cThis is interesting information that can be used by merchants to monitor risk,\u201d Grunspan said on the relevancy of their calculations. \u201cLet\u2019s say a merchant always waits for six confirmations before sending his goods to a customer, as that is the level of risk he is comfortable with. That\u2019s 60 minutes on average. But sometimes he\u2019ll have to wait for two hours before six blocks are found. If that happens, the double-spend risk is also higher. So for the same level of security, he\u2019ll actually have to wait for a seventh confirmation. While if the confirmations come in much faster, he should be fine even with five confirmations.\u201d\nAs double-spend protection is arguably at the heart of Bitcoin\u2019s innovation, the mathematical simplification in Satoshi\u2019s work is notable, especially for mathematicians. Grunspan does allow, however, that simplifying assumptions in a white paper is also understandable.\nAnd, perhaps, it reveals another hint about Bitcoin\u2019s origins.\n\u201cSatoshi was a genius,\u201d concluded Grunspan. \u201cBut he was not a mathematician.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 15}

But over the years, the Bitcoin mining system has increasingly centralized into fewer hands and fewer geographical regions. There are several explanations for this trend. But one of them is the emergence of specialized mining hardware: ASIC chips and miners.\nIn an attempt to solve this issue, scientists at the University of Luxembourg\u2019s Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) have developed a mathematical algorithm called \u201cEquihash.\u201d Equihash is the brainchild of Prof. Alex Biryukov, head of SnT research group \u201cCryptoLUX\u201d \u2014 focused on research and technology transfer in cryptology \u2014 and CryptoLUX researcher Dr. Dmitry Khovratovich. The algorithm was first unveiled at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium 2016 in San Diego.\nProbably its most significant success to date, Zcash, the new decentralized and open-source digital currency that aims to set a new standard for privacy and anonymity through the use of groundbreaking cryptography, announced the integration of Equihash in April 2016. In a post titled \u201cWhy Equihash?,\u201d Zcash founder Zooko Wilcox and engineer Jack Grigg noted that Equihash has very efficient verification which could enable light clients on constrained devices and Zcash clients inside Ethereum. But the main reason for the enthusiasm of the Zcash tech is, indeed, Equihash\u2019s resistance to ASIC mining.\n\u201cEquihash is a memory-oriented Proof-of-Work, which means how much mining you can do is mostly determined by how much RAM you have,\u201d said Wilcox and Grigg. \u201cWe think it is unlikely that anyone will be able to build cost-effective custom hardware (ASICs) for mining in the foreseeable future.\u201d Wilcox and Grigg added that it is unlikely that major optimizations of Equihash could give the miners who know the optimization an advantage.\nEquihash is a memory-hard problem, more suited to general-purpose computers with lots of memory than to special hardware chips. \u201cIf 10,000 miners with a single PC were active, in Zcash the investment to compete with them would be 10,000 times the price of a PC, while with Bitcoin, the investment would be significantly smaller,\u201d said Khovratovich. \u201cThe strength of a cryptocurrency comes from the fact that the ledger is globally distributed. Our Equihash algorithm reverses the situation back to this more ideal world.\u201d \nAccording to the CryptoLUX scientists, the algorithm permits avoiding centralization of the mining process in the hands of a few first-class miners with specialized mining hardware, thus contributing to the \u201cdemocratization\u201d of digital currencies based on Equihash.\n\u201cSince Equihash is based on a fundamental computer science problem, advances in Equihash mining algorithms will benefit computer science in general,\u201d added Biryukov. \u201cEquihash is so far unique among all the mining algorithms: it is memory-hard on the one hand and very easy to verify on the other.\u201d\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Equihash inventor Biryukov also emphasized that Equihash is a portable algorithm, not limited to specific digital currencies. \n\u201cWe don't have any formal relation with the Zcash project,\u201d he said. \u201cEquihash is not limited to Zcash, it can be used in any cryptocurrency.\u201d That said, Biryukov did sound cautiously enthusiastic about Zcash. \u201cCompared to many other cryptocurrencies Zcash definitely brings in new features based on state-of-the-art academic crypto. Whether it will scale well or not \u2014 the future will show.\u201d\nGiven the portability of Equihash, it\u2019s interesting to speculate about its possible integration in Bitcoin itself. \u201cI am not aware of such attempts, but it would be technically easy to do,\u201d noted Biryukov.\nFor more details on Equihash, see the research paper \u201cEquihash: asymmetric proof-of-work based on the Generalized Birthday problem.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 16}

The fund, whose limited partners include Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, was first announced in December of 2016, and has also backed MakerDAO and Golem.\nFounded by Arthur Breitman and Kathleen Breitman, Tezos is an independent smart contract platform built as an alternative to Ethereum. It focuses on transparency, security and governance by consensus as fundamental design goals. As such, all code is independently verifiable and includes integrated mechanisms for users to transparently decide on and implement upgrades to the Tezos system itself. When protocol changes need to be made, Tezos implements voting rights with its built-in consensus mechanism. This enables upgrades to be seamlessly integrated into the protocol with complete transparency.\nAccording to Kathleen Breitman, \u201cTezos has developed its own smart contract language, Michelson, which is statically typed, purely functional and designed to facilitate formal verification. Formal verification is a process which mathematically guarantees the correctness of some aspects of computer code. It has notably been used in the aerospace industry where the cost of bugs is particularly high.\u201d\n \n\u201cTezos has a secure language for smart contracts that supports formal verification. This means it is possible to mathematically prove the security of a contract,\u201d said Olaf Carlson-Wee, founder and CEO of Polychain Capital. \u201cIt is also self-amending, which allows it to scale and adapt to user demands through programmatic voting. Tezos is the first blockchain to formalize governance at the protocol level, which we believe is a fascinating experiment and potentially massive breakthrough.\u201d\n\u201cThis backing from Polychain comes at an important moment,\u201d said Arthur Breitman. \u201cIt enables us to move closer to launching a secure, future-proof platform that incorporates good governance, transparency and adaptability from the start. We couldn't be happier to have the support of Olaf and his team, who have been advocating for what we have been doing to a broad range of established stakeholders.\u201d\nA Different Funding Model\nTraditionally, venture capital firms are bound by a charter that guides the types of things they can allocate funds toward. Cryptographic tokens are rarely included in this list; therefore, for VCs who want to make a straight token purchase, this is not a traditional option. \nPolychain Capital\u2019s digital currency fund provides a way for VCs like Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures to participate in the appreciation of these tokens in the marketplace while staying in line with their charters. \n\u201cWe think this is significant because it represents a new business model,\u201d said Kathleen Breitman. \u201cWe created a product that was purchased by VC investors without the traditional equity investment model because of the anticipated appreciation of our token.\u201d \nTezos is planning to launch its test network in Q1 in advance of a crowd sale of its tokens. It will launch the production network shortly after the crowd sale closes.", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 17}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nNot everyone loves the latest draft of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF proposal.\nThe (prospective) Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, also known as \u201cCOIN,\u201d filed new documents to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week. Leading up to the highly anticipated decision by the commission on whether the exchange traded fund (ETF) will be approved next month, the amendment added what is perhaps best described as a \u201chard fork clause.\u201d\nThis hard fork clause has not won over everyone in Bitcoin\u2019s technical community; the amendment was quickly criticized on social media like Reddit and Twitter. Specifically, some worry that the proposed method to pick a \u201cwinning\u201d coin in the event of a coin-split may deprive future COIN investors. And it may, perhaps, even harm Bitcoin itself.\nHard Fork\nThe heart of the problem is a topic that has dominated the Bitcoin community for some time now: hard forks.\nA hard fork is an expansion of Bitcoin\u2019s protocol rules that is incompatible with existing rules. This makes hard forks risky: If not all users switch to the new protocol, Bitcoin can split in two. The result would be one network with the old set of rules and one network with the new set of rules, both with their own blockchain and their own distinct coin: a \u201ccoin-split.\u201d\nIn a best-case scenario coin-split, users on one or on both sides of the chain rebrand. For example, when Ethereum experienced a coin-split due to a hard fork last summer, users that stuck to the existing protocol rebranded that chain as \u201cEthereum Classic.\u201d\nBut in a worst-case scenario, users on both sides of the chain claim their chain to be the real thing. If that were to occur in Bitcoin, with no central foundation to hold a trademark, nor even an inventor active in the project, a dispute may not be that easy to resolve.\n\u201cHard forks are protocol replacements,\u201d Ciphrex CEO and Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo said, summarizing the issue. \u201cIn the event of a coin-split, I believe the fair approach is that the chain that changes the rules has the burden of proving that stakeholders, and not just miners, are overwhelmingly behind it. However, there is no universally agreed-upon convention regarding which chain should continue to be listed under the same symbol.\u201d\nNebulous CEO David Vorick \u2014 who had earlier commented on the ETF amendment on Reddit \u2014 agreed:\n\u201cThe side of the chain that wins the title \u2018Bitcoin\u2019 is the side people start referring to as \u2018Bitcoin.\u2019 If not everyone agrees, you may just get a giant cultural war.\u201d\nJudging by the amendment, COIN could inadvertently establish itself as a central player in this potential \u201ccultural war.\u201d\nCOIN ETF\nAn ETF is an investment fund that holds assets like stocks, commodities or bonds, and trades on stock exchanges. \nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss \u2014 the twins of \u201cThe Social Network\u201d fame \u2014 have been on a mission to create a bitcoin ETF for years. This ETF, COIN, would let institutional investors invest in bitcoin, without actually needing to buy or hold the digital currency themselves; these would be held by a custodian, Gemini.\nThe amendment to the COIN ETF filing submitted last week addresses the risk of hard forks. If the network splits, the amendment reads, the custodian will pick the side of the fork that has \u201cthe greatest cumulative computational difficulty for the forty-eight (48) hour period following a given hard fork.\u201d\nOr:\n\u201cIf the Custodian, in consultation with the Sponsor, is unable to make a conclusive determination about which Bitcoin Network has the greatest cumulative computational difficulty after forty-eight (48) hours, or determines in good faith that this is not a reasonable criterion upon which to make a determination, the Custodian will support the Bitcoin Network which it deems in good faith is most likely to be supported by a greater number of users and miners.\u201d\nIn other words: the \u201creal\u201d Bitcoin, for the ETF, will be the coin on the side of the chain that is backed by the most hash power after two days \u2014 unless the custodian decides otherwise.\nBest Case\nPerhaps a Bitcoin hard fork will be successful, with all hash power devoted to the new chain: hence, no coin-split.\nBut if there is a coin-split, it could get messy. Even in a best-case scenario, where one or both ends of the chain rebrand, ETF investors may be worse off than all other bitcoin holders. \nNormally, all bitcoin holders will in that case have coins on both sides of the chain: they are tied to the same private keys. Similarly, anyone who held ether on the Ethereum blockchain before the split owned both ether (ETH) and classic ether (ETC) after the split.\nThe \u201chard fork clause\u201d in the ETF amendment makes no mention of a potential minority chain at all, however.\n\u201cThat will be a problem if the unchosen fork has value,\u201d Bitcoin XT maintainer Tom Harding said. \u201cETFs have a net asset value that represents whatever underlies the ETF. In case of a coin-split, the value could be divided over two coins, not just one \u2018winning\u2019 coin, as the ETF amendment suggests.\u201d\nIndeed, in its current form, it seems the COIN ETF could lead to losses for investors.\nWorst Case\nAnd it gets worse if the split is not peaceful.\nContrary to a common misconception, hash power alone does not determine validity of a blockchain. Or, at the very least, not everyone agrees that it does. (On a conceptual level, the Bitcoin white paper contradicts itself on this issue in the first paragraph of chapter 11 and in the conclusion. On a technical level, hash power that does not conform to Bitcoin\u2019s protocol rules is simply ignored by nodes enforcing these rules, as it is considered to be \u201cnot Bitcoin.\u201d)\nIn contrast, the new ETF amendment does \u2014 at least in principle \u2014 establish hash power as a defining factor. This introduces significant risks.\nIf, for example, a majority of miners (by hash power) hard forks the protocol, and keeps this new chain running for 48 hours, they can impose any new rule they want. It would even allow them to create bitcoins out of thin air or attribute themselves bitcoins that never belonged to them.\nUnsurprisingly, the idea that miners have the power to redefine Bitcoin is rejected by many within Bitcoin\u2019s technical community.\n\u201cThe existing statement that they will \u2018support the fork with majority hash power after 48 hours\u2019 is too mechanical and too reckless,\u201d BitGo CTO Ben Davenport \u2014 who had earlier criticized the amendment on Twitter \u2014 told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cIt could actually lead to gaming of the ETF by miners.\u201d\nOf course, the hard fork clause does itself offer an alternative as well. If the custodian \u2014 Gemini \u2014 determines in good faith that hash power majority is not a reasonable criterion, it can itself pick a \u201cwinning\u201d side of the fork.\nBut this criterion hasn\u2019t won over the critics either.\nBlockstream CEO Dr. Adam Back had commented on the issue on Reddit before. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he explained:\n\u201cI suppose the discretion clause might deter a hedge fund from gaming the system in an egregious way; it\u2019s a sort of \u2018get out\u2019 clause in case someone does something crazy to game the hash rate. However, ideally discretion should be used only as a last resort. The realistic need to fall back on discretion in predictable circumstances may indicate a poor choice of rule.\u201d\nMoreover, just because the COIN ETF defines Bitcoin in a certain way doesn\u2019t mean the rest of the world will. As such, by its own definition, it becomes questionable whether the COIN is even really a bitcoin ETF.\n\u201cThe new terms as proposed by COIN basically say the ETF does not necessarily hold bitcoins,\u201d said Luke Dashjr, the Bitcoin Knots lead developer and Bitcoin Core contributor who had criticized the amendment on Reddit as well. \n\u201cInstead, it holds whatever cryptocurrency has the most SHA2 proof of work within a short period after splitting off from Bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cAs such, this ETF amendment is essentially mandating by law that a large chunk of formerly Bitcoin funds must choose to participate exclusively in an altcoin.\u201dNot generally known for holding back on his opinions, Dashjr concluded:\n\u201cAs these rules are being enforced by the State, this ETF \u2014 if approved \u2014 is nothing short of a State actor attacking Bitcoin.\u201d\nSolutions\nThe new amendment has therefore dampened excitement of the prospected ETF, at least for some.\n\u201cI have had friends and family asking, and periodically re-asking, for ways to buy bitcoin via a broker for several years, as a gold-like asset class \u2014 I think there is no doubt the demand is there,\u201d said Back. \u201cHowever, this late-breaking amendment looks quite troubling, and maybe more than offsets the ETF benefit.\u201d\nComing up with a solution to the problem, however, is not self-evident. While \u201cBitcoin\u201d may need to be defined for an ETF to stand any chance of being approved, and some have tried to define it, not everyone agrees with this definition. Furthermore, no one has the authority to define it.\n\u201cMy general sense is that trying to formalize a definition of a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency in a legal contract is extremely difficult,\u201d Lombrozo said. \u201cPeer-to-peer cryptocurrencies specifically attempt to sidestep jurisdictional issues by relying on the network incentives to maintain the proper checks and balances. Without the need for the intervention of courts.\u201d\nAlternatively, therefore, some suggested that the ETF may need to let go of its own strict definition of a \u201cbitcoin ETF.\u201d Instead, it could be a slightly more general ETF that is a bit more flexible.\nProposing a potential solution, Davenport said,\u00a0\u201cHere\u2019s the basic rule I\u2019d like to ensure is followed: for an investor, holding the ETF should be economically identical to holding bitcoin, minus fees. So if there is a fork, the investors must receive economic value for both sides of the fork. That could happen either through a dividend, through a split of the ETF itself, or through the ETF continuing to hold both sides of the fork in a 1:1 ratio.\u201d\nIn any case, several critics of the current proposal agreed that the ETF shouldn\u2019t be rushed if these issues aren\u2019t resolved. While the SEC has a self-imposed deadline for their decision on the COIN ETF for March 11, that shouldn\u2019t be reason to accept questionable clauses.\n\u201cBitcoin will grow into these kinds of setups,\u201d Vorick concluded. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s not ready for it this year, then maybe in two or three years, when people understand this stuff better. But it would be terrible if it got approved and then something bad happens. That would be worse than waiting.\u201d\nBack agreed:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m excited that ETFs appear to be making progress, but I\u2019m really hoping structural problems like this are rectified in time before approvals happen.\u201d\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to several people close to or involved with COIN, but has received no response at time of publication.", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 20}

While most Wall Street analysts are lambasted by bitcoin believers due to their misunderstandings of the digital asset, Bogart\u2019s knowledge of the technology has won him general praise from much of the community.\n\u201cWe are excited to hire Spencer Bogart as managing director and head of research at Blockchain Capital,\u201d Bart Stephens, a managing partner at the venture capital firm, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cSpencer is the most respected and widely followed Wall Street research analyst to cover blockchain technology and Bitcoin. His industry research report on the blockchain, as a technology, was a seminal piece of research and is a reference point for hedge fund managers, other venture capitalists and sophisticated investors around the globe.\u201d\nIn addition to his report on blockchain technology, Bogart has also released notes and reports on the future price of bitcoin and the prospects of approval for a potential bitcoin ETF.\nBogart\u2019s New Role at Blockchain Capital\nAccording to Stephens, Bogart will continue to release public reports and other writings as part of his role at Blockchain Capital.\n\u201cSpencer has a talent for deep due diligence in a nascent industry \u2014 blockchain technology,\u201d said Stephens. \u201cHe has excellent company contacts and will be a valuable member of the Blockchain Capital investment team.

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nTiming the market is difficult. If it were easy, everyone would do it. That\u2019s why many traders turn to technical analysis for an edge.\nAll any trader has is the left side of the chart (past) to try and determine the right side of the chart (future). Fortunately, all markets are essentially comprised of human behavior; therefore, markets have memory. It\u2019s this memory that comprises a basis for support and resistance zones. For example, large candle wicks (pricing trends representing the psychology of participating traders) can reflect emotional, exuberant and irrational human behavior which is exhibited either by buying beyond the sustainable market price, or by selling far below fair market value.\n\nNewer traders, including me back in 2013, often buy the parabolic, emotional, FEAR OF MISSING OUT highs, and then sell the lows, again out of fear. This is obviously the exact opposite of trying to \u201cbuy low and sell high.\u201d\nLet\u2019s paint some support (green) and resistance (red) on the current weekly chart. I\u2019m using Brave New Coin\u2019s $BLX index, which aggregates all bitcoin markets globally. Bitcoin is in a current state of upheaval because of fluctuations in the rankings of countries and exchanges with the highest trading volumes, the most liquidity, the optimal signals to follow and the highest probabilities of where price may go in the future. Aggregating all the data between the currencies and exchanges in one index means better signals and more realistic, fair-market prices. \n\n\nI\u2019ve added zones of resistance (red) at the All-Time High (ATH) candle wicks from 2013. This is where one might expect selling, based on prior price history. Price is currently in this large zone of heavy resistance, so one would EXPECT large amounts of volatility and repeated attempts to, with steadily increasing momentum, break the previous ATH. This zone represents previous irrational exuberance where some buyers were inevitably trapped in a position. If those buyers have not already sold, many will be looking to sell bitcoin at break even.\nThe trend is your friend, right until the end. Luckily, bitcoin is currently in a multi-year bull trend as exhibited by this weekly chart. Don\u2019t fight the trend! Meaning, you\u2019ll make more money going long or buying than you will going short, or selling. Investors, those with a longer timeline, look for growth opportunities like this, ideally at the bottom of the trend; whereas traders, who are often in and out of a trade within hours, days or weeks, can find a way to make money in any market. \u00a0\nYou\u2019ll also notice a zone of support, which had previously been resistance, represented by the large candle wick in April 2013. Once this resistance broke convincingly in October 2013, bitcoin entered price discovery mode, searching for a new ATH in parabolic fashion. Once established, support was rechecked months later, which held, paving the way for the beginning of a new bull trend.\nThere is also a yellow line representing 50 percent of the entire distance between established support and resistance. This is a key zone which helps determine whether or not support or resistance will be tested. If price holds above or breaks 50 percent of the resistance and support zone, there is often a test of the resistance zone. If price holds below or breaks 50 percent of the resistance and support zone, there is often a test of the support zone. This is known as Dow Theory, which essentially states that any large price move will retrace 50 percent of the move and make a decision from there. \nHere are those same principles applied within the macro trend on the daily timeframe. \n\n\nWe can convincingly see that with each test of support, price has bounced higher and proceeded to break the previous local top, or resistance. This is exactly what to look for in an established trend. You\u2019ll also notice that the 50 percent zone often gets rechecked as support. If previous resistance, turned support, fails to hold as support, then the entire trend is in jeopardy. Additionally, my revised Dow Theory holds true except in the case of January 2016 when support was not tested again for the second time.\nCurrently, price is attempting to reach for a previous local high, which also represents price near ATH. If/when ATH does break, the market reenters price discovery mode, which may or may not occur in a parabolic fashion, similar to 2013, albeit unlikely. Without getting too technical, there is confluence of resistance at ~$1800, which would be a definite take profit target as a trader. This can be determined by adding 50 percent above the current zone of resistance at ~$1200.\nEach move upward in the current trend has yielded a 50 percent move or greater.\n1. November 2015 - 57 percent move from previous resistance;\n2. June 2016 - 58 percent move from previous resistance;\n3. January 2017 - 51 percent move from previous resistance.\nAn interesting point of psychological resistance has been the USD price of gold, relative to bitcoin. In 2013, during the parabolic price discovery phase, the established high was ultimately slightly lower than the current price of gold ($XAUUSD) at the time. \n\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/f672tulF/\n\n\nThis may have been just a coincidence until it happened a second time in January 2017. Whether or not bitcoin can truly become \u201cdigital gold\u201d from a price perspective remains to be seen. \nCurrently, on the four-hour timeframe, there is no immediate resistance until the previous local top at $1173.\n\nWe can also predict that previous resistance of ~$1077 is now support, until proven otherwise. So should price pull back, this would be the immediate target.\nSummary\n1.\u00a0All markets have memory and because of this, traders can use the past history of support and resistance to predict future support and resistance with a high probability.\n2. Bitcoin price is an ongoing multi-year bull trend. Price is leaning heavily bullish in the near, medium and far term with a realistic target of $1800 within the coming months and definitely within the next twelve months.\n3. The psychological barrier of the previous ATH, as well as gold parity, are two of the closest checkpoints before \u201cprice discovery\u201d mode beyond previous ATH.\n4. If/When ATH does break, expect wild volatility. A large candle wick with high volume on the daily chart will signify the end of the near term trend. This is known as a \u201cblow-off top.\u201d\n5. After the blow-off top, expect a retest of previous resistance of ATH at $1176, which would then be support. \u00a0", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 22}

The results were announced February 14, 2017. The Synechron team of five employees set out to solve the problem: How can existing title deeds for land registry be handled in Dubai using blockchain technology?\nSynechron is a New York\u2013based financial services consulting firm whose clients include global investment banks, intermediaries, hedge funds and wealth managers. For the first time, it is working with a number of companies on blockchain use case and application development initiatives. \nThe World Government Summit is a UAE-based international organization that serves as a platform for global dialogue to \u201crevolutionize\u201d how governments operate and how government policies are made. \nSponsored by Microsoft, IBM, ConsenSys and BlockApps, the Blockchain Virtual GovHack is aimed at students and startups from around the world that experiment with new technologies to produce outstanding applications. The winning team took home $100,000, the runner-up $30,000 and the second runner-up $20,000. \nThe competition is reportedly the world\u2019s largest virtual blockchain hackathon with 1,011 participants across 41 nationalities working on 131 projects. Winners were selected by a panel of judges that included blockchain experts from IBM, Microsoft and ConsenSys, along with Dubai government officials.\nThe United States submitted 40 projects, India had 29 entries, Canada and Australia had 13 each, and the UAE 9 projects, while Spain and Germany had 7 and 6 entries respectively.\nSome of the participating projects aimed to increase the security of smart city systems, facilitate patient data management through digital medical records, detect online fraud cases, improve paper printing and find innovative personal ID solutions.\nThe international panel of judges, including many high-profile names in the blockchain space, awarded points in the following four categories:\nExecution: How well put together was the project and the demo that was shown? Does it solve a genuine consumer problem? (5 Points)\nImpact: Is the solution commercially viable? Does it have the potential to scale? (5 Points)\nCreativity: How out of the box was the solution? (5 Points)\nDesign: How well designed, including UX, UI and user flow, was the solution? (5 Points)\nSynechron Managing Director of Innovation David Horton said:\n\u201cTeam Land Registry was made up of a group of five Synechron employees from its 50-person blockchain team across geographies and business areas. We had financial services specialists, technologists and digital experts on the team that allowed us to develop an end-to-end solution. The team accomplished this by mapping the existing process and re-imagining how those decentralized parties would need to change their workflows to submit that information by using blockchain [technology].\u201d\nTheir solution was built in three weeks using the Ethereum blockchain that leverages IPFS for document management, a Web 3.0 accelerator library built using Node.js, HTML5 and Angular.\n\nAbove is the final document submitted to the judges by the Synechron hackathon team showing all the elements needed to build a land title registry program on the Ethereum platform.\nThe platform included four nodes, one each for the land department, the property owner and buyer, the banks and mortgage lenders, and the property insurance company. The UI was built with user experience in mind, integrated with the UAE\u2019s Makani API to provide GPS coordinates and a blockchain activity log and viewer.\nThe public node for property buyers allows buyers to easily initiate a title transfer request and easy document photo submission.\nHorton told Bitcoin Magazine that they chose to use the Ethereum blockchain because the team felt that it was the best for this use case:\n\u201cEthereum is a public blockchain that is permissionless, so currently it has made the most progress with the issue of scalability, whether it is by bringing identity to the entire human population or in data from IoT devices.\u201d\nHorton added:\n\u201cThere are a number of blockchain platforms available today. Currently, we\u2019re seeing three leaders pull ahead from the others \u2013 Ethereum, Hyperledger and Ripple. Each has its own strengths, and before selecting a platform, companies need to do a thorough business analysis of the problem they\u2019re looking to solve and which platform best suits the use case.\u201d\nAccording to Horton, what enabled Synechron to create a winning model is its \u201cpower of three\u201d: a deep technical understanding of blockchain technology, the consulting expertise to understand and explain how business operations can benefit from distributed ledger technology, and the design expertise to be able to create user interfaces that allow people to easily conceptualize the potential of the technology.\n\u201cWithin a few days of the award at the World Government Summit, we have already seen serious interest in our land title deeds solution by government entities in Sweden, Cyprus and Qatar,\u201d Horton added.\nProject Oaken, a blockchain and IoT design firm put a Tesla on the Ethereum blockchain as a piece of a smart city toll road infrastructure solution to win the hackathon.\nIn second place was a computer science and electronics technology company Maroon Studios with their entry HealthBlocks.", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 22}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin was never really anonymous, and it seems the Danish police have caught on to that fact. According to reports by Danish newspaper Berlingske, law enforcement in the Scandinavian country has figured out how to apply blockchain analysis to hunt down and prosecute darknet market vendors.\n\u201cThe perspective is groundbreaking,\u201d Kim Aarenstrup, head of the National Cyber Crime Centre (NC3) of the Danish National Police, told Berlingske. \u201cWhere the investigation previously hit a dead end, we can now proceed.\u201d\nBlockchain Analysis\nBitcoin has been presented as an anonymous digital currency for a long time. But this is not really accurate. While payments are not made to real-world identities, they are made to Bitcoin addresses that are publicly available on the blockchain. If such an address can be tied to a real-world identity, all anonymity is lost. That\u2019s why some refer to Bitcoin as \u201cpseudonymous\u201d rather than anonymous.\nBy applying blockchain analysis and combining this with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies by bitcoin exchanges, Danish police are able to track down darknet market users.\n\u201cWe are pretty much unique in the world at this point because no one else has managed to use these tracks as evidence,\u201d Aarenstrup told Berlingske. \u201cEveryone is looking toward Denmark in this field, and we are in close dialogue with a number of other countries right now so we can further develop methods and teach them how we do it here.\u201d\nMore specifically, it seems the Danish police are using blockchain analysis to close a sort of legal loophole utilized by users of darknet markets like AlphaBay and Silk Road. Contraband \u2014 often illegal drugs \u2014 are typically shipped to the home addresses of darknet customers. But if the package is intercepted by the police, the buyer can simply deny having ordered anything.\nNow, NC3 claims to have developed special software that applies blockchain analysis to prove that the delivery address matches a specific Bitcoin transaction. This has led to two convictions over the past few months.\nCybercrime\nIn part due to its perceived anonymity, Bitcoin has grown to be a wildly popular payment method for cybercriminals. In a report published last year, Europol \u2014 the law enforcement agency of the European Union \u2014 said more than 40 percent of online transactions for illegal ends are made with bitcoin.\nSpeaking to Berlingske, Aarenstrup acknowledged that the ease of use of bitcoin is a growing concern:\n\u201cBitcoin \u2014 and virtual currency in general \u2014 is widely used in the trafficking of weapons and drugs, and in ransomware and extortion cases. It is used a lot by criminals.\u201d \nUnsurprisingly, Bitcoin is increasingly becoming a central point of focus for cybercrime units worldwide. Only last month, a joint initiative of Europol, Interpol (the intergovernmental organization facilitating international police cooperation) and the Basel Institute on Governance (an independent not-for-profit competence center specializing in financial crime) indicated that they would up the efforts to counter bitcoin money laundering.\nAnd Danish authorities have been paying attention to the digital currency for some time now as well. A 2015 strategic analysis report by the Danish National Police mentioned bitcoin as a key focal point to counter cybercrime.\nThe success of the new Danish tracking method appears to have already been embraced by international organizations: both the FBI and Europol are already using the system, according to Berlingske.\n\u201cI would just say to those out there in the criminal community that they need to be careful because we can follow them. They should not think they can hide from the police anymore,\u201d Aarenstrup concluded.", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 23}

After being exposed to and learning as many technical indicators as possible, he became an expert on the Ichimoku cloud.\nAt any given time, all markets consist of buyers and sellers. When there are more sellers than buyers, prices go down, and when there are more buyers than sellers, prices go up. Right now, more people are buying bitcoin than selling it. It\u2019s that simple and as much as everyone will try to find reasons for the phenomenon, there does not need to be one. The most obvious reason for the rising price is being attributed to the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, COIN, which is due for a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision by March 11, but may occur at any time before that date.\nSeveral USD exchanges made new all-time highs (ATHs) in price today. Bitfinex, Bitstamp, BTC-e and Coinbase, exchanges that established their previous ATHs in 2013, all made new highs. Brave New Coin\u2019s index, BLX, also made a new ATH, while GDAX, Coinbase\u2019s asset exchange, broke its previously established high of $1,175 on January 2, as well. \nGemini, an exchange owned by the Winklevoss twins, also broke their ATH. GBTC, a bitcoin investment trust that once held a large premium, which has been shrinking in recent months, has not yet made a new ATH and is now trading below spot price. \u00a0\nThe Chinese exchanges OKCoin and BTCC have not made ATHs at the time of writing this article. This suggests that demand and price action are largely driven by USD buyers. The previous OKCoin high was 8888 CNY. As per regulatory request of the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC), bitcoin withdrawals are currently halted on these Chinese exchanges as well. \nBecause there is no actual resistance remaining on the chart, traders must use mathematical methods to attempt to predict a price target. It is always possible that these targets become meaningless with price entering a large parabolic leg upward until no buyers remain.\nPivot points are calculated from previous support and resistance levels. For yearly pivots, the horizontal support (S) and resistance (R) levels are calculated on January 1 of each year and do not change until the next year. Currently, price is sitting just below the R1 pivot. A clean break of the R1 would suggest a reach and test of the R2 pivot at $1,400.\n\nYou can see how accurate these levels have been the prior year as well. \nFibonacci extensions are another way of calculating support and resistance levels based on previous price, in this case an extreme high and an extreme low.\n\nThe 1.618 extension yields a target of $1,445 as a potential resistance zone. \nPsychological resistance can also manifest, where traders subconsciously tend to focus on factors such as:\n1. Round, even numbers like 1,000 or 1,050;\n2. Culturally relevant numbers like 666. The number four is bad luck in China, whereas the number eight is good luck;\n3. Comparing markets to other assets. Should digital gold, bitcoin, be worth more than actual gold per ounce?\n4. The now defunct exchange, Mt. Gox, had an established ATH of $1,242, which may act as a type of psychological resistance as well because bitcoin price has never been higher than this in USD terms.\nSummary\n1.\u00a0USD exchanges and demand have driven bitcoin prices higher while Chinese exchanges have taken a backseat.\n2. Although no resistance remains beyond the ATH, there are mathematical methods to calculate the next resistance zones, such as pivots and Fibonacci extensions, which yield targets of $1,400 and $1,445 respectively.\n3. Bitcoin has never traded above $1,242, a Mt. Gox ATH, or above the USD price of gold per ounce.\n\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Almost as soon as the new three-year high was hit, it was announced that the Chinese central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC), was meeting with China\u2019s largest bitcoin exchanges Huobi, BTCC and OKCoin to discuss future regulations and issued a public warning against the risks of trading bitcoin. This was followed by on-site inspections at the three bitcoin exchanges to investigate for potential money laundering, market manipulation and unauthorized financing. This sent the price of bitcoin plummeting down back to $761 on January 12. \nBitcoin Is Maturing as an Asset Class\nDespite the similarity in price movements to November 2013, bitcoin is now showing signs of becoming a more mature asset class. After the initial price drop, the price of bitcoin quickly recovered to trade back in the $900s for the remainder of January and surpassed the $1,000 mark again in February, despite new regulations affecting Chinese bitcoin trading volumes. \nChinese exchanges have had to stop their margin trading offerings, and all three exchanges introduced a 0.2 percent trading fee to combat overtrading, as their zero-trading fee model has been one of the key drivers of the large bitcoin trading volumes on Chinese shores. \nFurthermore, on February 9, both Huobi and OKCoin announced that they have halted withdrawals after the Chinese regulator threatened to close exchanges that are not complying with currency regulations as they are upgrading their KYC/AML procedures. After this announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped to $956 but recovered again to trade above the $1,000 mark two days later, showing clearly that Chinese influence on the price of bitcoin is weakening. \nNot only are the previously inflated trading volumes on Chinese exchanges dropping, but volatility has also reduced, due to the overall reduction in bitcoin margin trading as Chinese regulators have halted this practice on Chinese shores. \nNew All-Time High in Anticipation of Winklevoss ETF\nAs Chinese bitcoin influence is lessening and the price of bitcoin is becoming more stable, bitcoin reached a new all-time high on February 23, surpassing the $1,200 mark for the first time since bitcoin\u2019s inception in 2009. \nWhile a range of drivers can be highlighted for the current price surge, such as increased bitcoin demand from emerging markets countries, bitcoin-positive news in mainstream media, high price predictions for bitcoin by market experts and a maturing bitcoin ecosystem, the most prominent reason for the current price surge is the anticipation of the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC\u2019s) decision on the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF. \nShould the SEC approve the public listing of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF with the proposed ticker COIN on March 11, this could potentially give bitcoin a massive boost in price if institutional investors choose to buy the ETF for portfolio diversification. If the Winklevoss ETF receives approval then it is likely that other bitcoin ETFs, such as the Bitcoin Investment Trust and SolidX, will also be approved. If institutional investors end up pouring money into these ETFs, the funds will need to purchase bitcoins underlying the fund boosting its price. \nDespite that the chances of a bitcoin ETF receiving SEC approval are perceived as being rather slim, the upside potential for bitcoin, should an ETF be approved, is substantial. According to boutique investment bank Needham & Company, if the Winklevoss ETF receives approval and amasses $2 billion assets under management, the price of bitcoin is estimated to reach around $3,200 per coin. \nGiven the huge upside price potential of a Bitcoin ETF approval and limited downside as the price of bitcoin has been stabilizing, it is not surprising that more traders are buying bitcoin and, thereby, pushing up the price as bitcoin\u2019s current risk/return ratio is positively skewed toward the upside.", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 24}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nSegregated Witness (SegWit) is a proposed soft-forking change to the Bitcoin protocol that, among other things, increases capacity of the network. In addition to an estimated doubling of the block size limit, SegWit is also viewed as a key improvement for layer-two solutions such as the lightning network and TumbleBit.\nOne of the key criticisms of SegWit up to this point has been the fact that the increased capacity enabled by this upgrade is not implemented as soon as the change is activated; however, it\u2019s now looking much more likely that SegWit could offer a nice bump in capacity shortly after activation.\nIt should be noted that this critique of SegWit\u2019s increase in the block size limit looks at Bitcoin only from a bird\u2019s-eye view. On an individual user basis, the benefits of increased capacity are seen as soon as the user upgrades. In other words, it\u2019s unclear if the \u201cslow\u201d nature of SegWit\u2019s increase to the block size limit on a macro level even matters.\nWhy Segregated Witness Is Not an Instant Block Size Limit Increase\nThe reason that it was originally thought that Segregated Witness would not offer much in terms of increased capacity right out of the gate is that wallets, exchanges and other creators of transactions must also complete their own upgrades before the benefits of SegWit could be seen on the network. \nSince each user must effectively opt in to the increased capacity offered by SegWit, the growth in capacity would be seen when users start using SegWit transactions rather than when the protocol change is initially activated.\nIt should be noted that some Bitcoin Core contributors have downplayed the amount of time it would take for service providers to implement SegWit-related changes into their own software.\nAnother common argument against the capacity increase offered by SegWit has been that none of the in-progress lightning networks are ready for production use. While there aren\u2019t any bitcoin wallet providers that have implemented lightning payments in their own software, Lightning Labs did recently release an alpha version of their lightning network daemon.\nWork is also progressing on an implementation of TumbleBit.\nMajor Wallet Providers Are Ready for Segregated Witness\nSince the issue of SegWit\u2019s slow block size limit increase was first raised over a year ago, many different companies and projects in the Bitcoin ecosystem have become SegWit-ready or are at least prepared to implement the change if and when it is nearing activation. Perhaps most notably, Blockchain.info has implemented the necessary changes to allow their users to make SegWit transactions once the change is activated.\n\n\n.@kyletorpey inch up to activation & all can push blocksize to ~2MB. silver lining to drama/delay: more segwit ready, more scale out of gate\u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) February 18, 2017\n\n\n\nAccording to BitGo CTO Ben Davenport, their customers would find the movement to SegWit outputs to be a rather straightforward process. He told Bitcoin Magazine that once BitGo has has rolled out new SegWit addresses for their wallets, customers would be able to update their software development kits. At that point, it would just be a matter of their customers spending through the existing non-SegWit UTXOs in their wallets.\n\u201cCustomers have every incentive to upgrade as it cuts their fees in half,\u201d added Davenport. \u201cAnd our customers\u2019 wallets are very active, so old outputs would be quickly spent. I estimate BitGo alone could free up about 60 KB more block space.\u201d\nWith a 1 MB block size limit, 60 KB basically amounts to 6 percent of the maximum potential block size. The effective increase in block space availability would be greater than Davenport\u2019s 6 percent estimate if SegWit transactions were used in that newly freed-up space.\nAlthough BitGo is not yet SegWit ready, Davenport claims the bitcoin wallet provider could make the necessary changes in a matter of weeks. \u201cWe haven\u2019t prioritized it, as we see little chance of it activating soon,\u201d he explained.\nWhile Blockchain.info\u2019s impact on SegWit adoption as a creator of a large chunk of total bitcoin transactions is obvious, there\u2019s an added bonus to BitGo\u2019s adoption of the improvement. Due to the way the upgrade works, SegWit\u2019s impact on capacity is increased as more people use multisignature transactions. This is relevant because multisig is essentially BitGo\u2019s bread and butter.\n\"Although Davenport claims BitGo accounts for roughly 6 to 7 percent of all daily transactions on the Bitcoin network, he estimates that the company also accounts for greater than 80 percent of all multisig transactions.\"\nSegregated Witness Is Still Awaiting Activation\nOf course, SegWit\u2019s activation on the Bitcoin network is far from a done deal. Miner support for the proposed improvement has stagnated at roughly 25 percent, and the current implementation calls for support from 95 percent of the network hashrate.\nIn recent months, nearly every bitcoin exchange and wallet provider of note has at least stated their intention to implement the necessary changes to prepare for the activation of SegWit, but many mining pool operators have yet to signal support for this change.\nNote: This article has been updated to correct BitGo's share of daily transactions on the Bitcoin network.", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 24}

But now, amid the throes of global economic and political unrest, new questions have emerged as to whether \u201ccash is still king\u201d in both developed and developing nations.\nThe root of this discourse is being played out with great significance worldwide. India, one of the world\u2019s fastest growing nations, is struggling with the effects of a demonetization crisis that threatens to cripple its promising economic advancements. In China, currency speculators are facing a weakening yuan. Venezuelans are under siege due to a government cash crisis and soaring inflation. And in Mexico, the peso has declined precipitously on the heels of the U.S. election of President Donald Trump.\nThis assault on fiat is impacted by unsound policy decisions on the part of governments across the world. Cash is an open form of exchange, widely accepted and codified by central authorities. It also freely flows into the hands of nefarious actors, which, due to terrorist and other concerns, makes governments uneasy. \nAs economic disruption continues to have a chilling effect on cash economies, digital currencies, which enable secure, peer-to-peer payments without the interference of central governments or banks, are gaining increased attention. Bitcoin, the oldest and most recognized digital currency, had a major rise in value in 2016. Some attribute this rise to increasing demand in countries most affected by currency volatility and economic uncertainty. \nIn an exclusive interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Steven J. Ehrlich, associate at the New York\u2013based Spitzberg Partners LLC, weighed in on changes taking place within the prevailing global order and cash economy. Spitzberg Partners is a consultancy firm that helps\u00a0clients to develop and execute market entry and M&A strategies for Europe, North America, and beyond.\nFor starters, Ehrlich says that he is hesitant to characterize these developments as a \u201cwar on cash,\u201d as some media outlets have suggested, since that, he says, would imply \u201ca concerted and coordinated effort.\u201d At the same time, he states that our global economy is in the middle of a tenuous recovery; thus, growth is not evenly distributed. \nCorruption still exists, Ehrlich laments, saying that at times, \u201cmonetary policy in a given country is primarily intended to support the political aims of a government rather than the economy as a whole.\u201d \u00a0\nSays Ehrlich: \u201cPeople want to feel in control of their holdings to the greatest extent possible, and at the very least would like stability and clear headings within their respective political climates. The peso moving up and down with every tweet sent by then-candidate and now-President Trump is the quintessential example of how that is not always the case.\u201d \n\nWill Bitcoin Emerge? \u00a0\n\nEhrlich says that given shifting global dynamics, it\u2019s no secret that bitcoin is being increasingly seen by many as a safe harbor or even a hedge for users in distressed economies (Venezuela, Argentina) as well as those with very strict currency controls (China). \n\nNevertheless, he is still skeptical of bitcoin\u2019s potential as an alternative form of currency for a couple of reasons. First, the pain point, he says, for the majority of people wanting to use cash or credit cards is not deep enough to force them to change their habits. \u201cIf we use Geoffrey Moore\u2019s \u2018Crossing the Chasm\u2019 example, I find it difficult to see how bitcoin moves from innovators and early adopters to an early majority of users.\u201d \u00a0\n\nContinues Ehrlich: \u201cIf it is ever to become a widely used currency, the [bitcoin] fungibility issue would still need to be solved. I believe that every bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) would have to be indistinguishable from any other, or else people may be hesitant to accept those coins as remuneration. It could also lead to different prices for different bitcoins depending on their past.\u201d \n\nHe does admit that it\u2019s impossible to ignore bitcoin\u2019s performance over the course of 2016, and that its current positioning as a largely uncorrelated asset is very enticing. \n\nCautionary Tales \n\nFor Ehrlich, the first point of caution is government regulation: \n\n\u201cChinese officials have outsize influence on the market, but right now they largely aim to maintain \u2018strategic ambiguity\u2019 as it relates to regulating the market. While they themselves cannot shut down Bitcoin, if they moved aggressively against the infrastructure there, it would be very damaging to the ecosystem. Additionally, in my opinion, Bitcoin regulations throughout other parts of the world \u2014 particularly as they pertain to commerce \u2014 have still been relatively light due to its comparatively small market capitalization. But should there be an uptick in use, I\u2019d expect governments to become much more engaged.\u201d \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA second potential hurdle that Ehrlich notes is the possibility of another major hack of a central player, though the industry has been able to weather Mt. Gox, Bitfinex and Bitstamp so far. And he concedes that if it is ever proven that Bitcoin was used to facilitate a terrorist attack, he would expect governments to move very hard and swiftly against exchanges and money service businesses. \n\nAdditionally, he suggests that a damaging \u201cHigh Impact/Low Probability\u201d event such as a potential DAO/hard fork incident with Bitcoin could occur. \u201cWhile I do not expect this to happen, especially in the near future, \u00a0scalability and governance issues will likely not go away even if today\u2019s hurdles are cleared. There also may come an issue or time when participants decide to create or even accidentally fall into competing Bitcoin networks. This is one issue that gold hasn\u2019t had to deal with.\u201d \u00a0\n\nWhen asked for his prognostication regarding the future of cash, Ehrlich responded: \n\n\u201cI do feel like cash is becoming a bit of an antiquated institution. I carry no more than a couple of dollars on me at any given time. The real question is whether or not our virtual currency future will be decentralized. In either circumstance, I would still hope that the currency would be fungible because on privacy grounds alone people would be hesitant to accept anything to the contrary. Governments could still benefit from ensuring that money does not simply disappear into thin air, which will assist with AML/KYC investigations and tax collection.\u201d \u00a0\n\nConcludes Ehrlich: \u201cIn my opinion the likeliest scenario is one where central banks issue digital versions of their currencies, as the prosecution of monetary policy remains a core government function and is not something that they want to cede.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 26}

And they weren\u2019t really sure what that was, so they contacted us.\u201d\nSingh noted that Bitpay has helped facilitate these sorts of transactions several times over the past few years. \u201cWe walked him through how it works and the process,\u201d said Singh.\nThe purchase price of the home in question was roughly $4 million.\nAccidentally Making $1 Million\nSingh went on to explain that the bitcoin price was at $750 when the transaction to purchase the house was initiated.

The company expects LH to also become, with time, \u201can inflation-proof asset that will be attractive to long-term investors and traders wanting to park funds overnight.\u201d\n\u201cWe believe that the most valuable thing in this world is time; therefore, we are basing a currency on it,\u201d said Sergienko. \u201cPeople\u2019s work time and skills are abundant enough to be accessible to anyone, yet scarce enough to be valuable.\u201d\nChronoBank has now integrated the Changelly app within its main wallet software. Changelly, developed by the MinerGate team, is an instant exchange app that aggregates rates from external exchanges and offers the best rate to the user, who is then able to easily and quickly exchange digital currencies without technical hassles. At this moment, Changelly permits trading in bitcoin, ether, Zcash and several other altcoins.\n\u201cThe ability to trade these LH tokens quickly, easily and without slippage against other national and virtual currencies is vital to the smooth operation of ChronoBank and confidence in our platform,\u201d said Sergienko. \u201cThat is why we are working to ensure they are listed on a wide range of exchanges. Moreover, we are implementing Changelly right within the core ChronoBank wallet. That will make it incredibly easy for users to exchange LH for bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies with practically zero delay.\u201d\nIn a statement, Sergienko explained that Changelly is well established and trusted in the crypto world. \u201cIt is a clean, reliable interface that we will integrate directly into the ChronoWallet to give our users another choice for trading\u200a \u2014 \u200ain this case, one that\u2019s all about speed and convenience,\u201d he said. The integration of Changelly will allow anyone to buy LH tokens quickly using a variety of payment options, including bitcoin and MasterCard/Visa credit cards. They can then use the tokens to buy services on ChronoBank\u2019s exchange.\nThe concept of using skilled work time as currency is not new. For example, Ithaca HOURS, a local currency used in Ithaca, New York, since 1991, is the oldest and largest local currency system operating in the U.S. at this time. One Ithaca HOUR, valued at $10, is recommended to be used as payment for one hour's work, although the rate is negotiable. Ithaca HOURS are printed tokens meant for local use, and there is no standard mechanism to convert Ithaca HOURS to dollars. Therefore, the usage of Ithaca HOURS has been declining in the last few years, and the concept doesn\u2019t seem easily extensible to current trends toward digital, global \u201cgig economies,\u201d of which Uber is the best-known example.\nThe ChronoBank concept seems to improve upon Ithaca HOURS on several fronts: a digital token that can be converted to digital or fiat currencies, delocalization, decentralization and app-based ease of use. Therefore, it\u2019s worth keeping ChronoBank under close observation and watching its next moves. The ChronoBank Initial Coin Offering (ICO), which has raised more than $3 million to date, is ongoing until February 14.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 31}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nCryptosteel is a device that allows bitcoin holders to back up their private keys in a fireproof, waterproof and shockproof manner. The idea is that the Cryptosteel will be able to act as a backup for any type of Bitcoin address for long periods of time, and many people see it as a useful companion to a hardware wallet.\nCryptosteel recently sent me one of their devices, and I opened it up to see how the whole process works.\nSetting Up a Cryptosteel\nIt\u2019s easy to get started with the Cryptosteel MNEMONIC in a matter of minutes. The packaging is nice enough, and the artwork by contributing artist Rafael Akahira gives it a special, unique appearance.\n\nOnce the actual Cryptosteel device is out of the packaging, the product\u2019s usefulness is immediately apparent. Although the Cryptosteel\u2019s size is somewhere between that of a credit card and an old iPhone, it feels sturdier than a brick; a good bit of weight is packed into its small stature.\nAfter twisting the product open like some kind of Swiss Army knife, the frame where the stainless steel numbers, letters and other characters should be placed can be seen.\nThe steel characters that come with the device are separated into different sections, so it\u2019s easy to find the ones you need. There\u2019s even a chart similar to what you would find in a box of chocolates that tells you where each character can be found. Each piece of steel has a letter, number or other symbol on both the front and the back.\n\nTo begin placing characters into the device, a small lock must be turned counterclockwise and a safety pawl must be bent open (not at the same time). I used a butter knife to complete both of these steps.\nThere is a small gate that needs to be opened before placing the steel piecesletters into the frame. Although it seemed difficult to get the characters into the frame at first, I soon realized that the gate can also act as a hammer to knock them into place.\n\nI didn\u2019t take the time to put in a 24-word mnemonic phrase, but I got a handle on how the Cryptosteel works by putting my name into the frame before closing it back up. This took a few minutes to complete. I imagine a full 24-word phrase could be completed in less than 30 minutes.\nHow Cryptosteel Could Be Improved\nUsing the Cryptosteel was a rather straightforward process, but I do have a few suggestions.\nThe first one isn\u2019t much of a complaint, but it would be nice if there was a YouTube video that showed the user exactly how to set up and use his or her Cryptosteel. There are a few videos on the Cryptosteel YouTube page, but they appear to be based on old prototypes. Something like this is likely already in the works, but in the future, a message on the packaging that tells the user to go to a specific website to watch a setup video may be a good idea.\nThe only real issue I see with the Cryptosteel is the packaging of the steel character pieces with the characters on them. They are separated into different pockets in the packaging, but each section could be sealed off better. Having the characters get mixed together during the shipping process didn\u2019t seem to be a serious issue, but it\u2019s unclear what a user is supposed to do with the set of characters after they\u2019re done using them.\nMost people will likely put all of the letters in a bag and put them to the side, but this will dramatically increase the amount of time it takes to enter a new series of characters into the frame of the Cryptosteel in the future. This is an unlikely scenario given that the point of the Cryptosteel is to use it once, but it\u2019s worth mentioning. Someone could also run into this issue if they decide to stop entering characters into the frame and need to finish the process later.\nCreating more separation between the sets of characters for long-term storage would be a nice improvement.\nWhen to Use a Cryptosteel\nThis is an awesome device. I can\u2019t imagine using anything else to back up private keys to a Bitcoin address.\nTrezor Architect Marek \u201cSlush\u201d Palatinus has said it\u2019s the perfect way to back up the seed of a Trezor hardware wallet. It would obviously work well as a backup for a hardware device from Ledger or KeepKey as well.\nFor added security, multiple Cryptosteel devices could be placed in different locations as a backup for a multisig address. Alternatively, a user could separate his or her savings into multiple Cryptosteel devices to weaken the impact of one of them being lost or stolen. Some combination of these two options is also worth considering.\nThe Cryptosteel is basically a paper wallet on steroids. It\u2019s one of the best available options for long-term storage of Bitcoin private keys.\nDisclosure: The author of this article was provided a free Cryptosteel MNEMONIC for the purposes of this review.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 26}

According to cnLedger, the exchange plans to implement trading fees at an as-of-yet undetermined time in the future.\nBTCC, Huobi, OKCoin and YUNBI Implement Trading Fees\nEarlier this week, four of China\u2019s largest bitcoin exchanges added trading fees to their platforms following reviews from regulators at the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC). According to statements released by bitcoin exchanges BTCC, Huobi, OKCoin and YUNBI, the move is an attempt to limit market manipulation and exchange-rate volatility.\nAccording to Reuters, the addition of trading fees was not a direct order from the PBOC. Instead, it was an attempt by the exchanges to help align with the PBOC\u2019s desire to see the bitcoin market cool down.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the no-fee trading policy on China-based bitcoin exchanges had been attractive for those who developed bots to do their trading for them.\nCHBTC Still Has a No-Fee Policy \u2014 For Now\nFor the time being, CHBTC has decided to continue with their current fee policy until a new fee policy is decided on and implemented. For this reason, the volume at the exchange has not experienced the massive declines seen at the big three exchanges in China.\nCHBTC is now doing about as much CNY-based bitcoin trading in volume as BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin combined.\nIn addition to CHBTC, London-based exchange Coinfloor also offers no-fee bitcoin trading. Ironically, Coinfloor implemented the no-fee trading policy last week.\nCHBTC charges fees on withdrawals, and the fee for a withdrawal is based on a user\u2019s trading volume. In other words, users are incentivized to trade more and inflate the total trading volume of the exchange before a withdrawal is made.\nAlthough CHBTC does not charge any fees on bitcoin trades, the exchange does charge a 0.05 percent fee on ether classic trades.\nChina\u2019s Role in Bitcoin Trading Not as Big as Previously Thought\nSevere declines in bitcoin trading volume have been seen on the China-based bitcoin exchanges that have recently added fees to the trading process. For example, bitcoin trading volume on BTCC has declined more than 90 percent over the past few days.\nIt\u2019s likely that CHBTC will see a similar decline in trading volume when they follow the lead of the other China-based bitcoin exchanges and implement trading fees.\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, China still has the three largest bitcoin exchanges by volume among exchanges that charge fees on trades.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 26}

He is actively involved in multiple blockchain initiatives and is fascinated by the potential that this technology has to improve our world.\nCanada\u2019s energy sector is facing a challenging economic environment. As in past commodity price cycles, innovation holds the promise of renewal. \nSharply lower energy commodity prices have dramatically compressed levels of upstream activity, employment and capital investment. Fundamental changes in commodity supply dynamics, climate change policy initiatives and pipeline constraints have contributed to a highly uncertain definition of \u201cprice\u201d recovery.\n \nWorld-leading innovation has always been a hallmark of our energy sector. Drilling technologies, seismic analysis, enhanced recovery and bitumen exploitation are some headline areas where our sector has revolutionized industry practices. The new economic challenges have sharpened the sector\u2019s focus on driving operating efficiencies and cost reduction through innovation. Everything from new remote sensing to edge computing and from enhanced data analytics to cloud solutions are being evaluated and implemented to retool and re-cost the sector\u2019s operating model. We\u2019re seeing a lot of movement in the mining and energy sector demonstrating blockchain technology\u2019s enormous potential to contribute to this retooling. This post aims to summarize these movements and demonstrate how blockchains can impact upstream and downstream operations.\n \nSince its origin as the platform for Bitcoin, blockchain technology has emerged a potential disruptor for global financial services. With a projected industry savings of up to $20 billion by 2022 achieved through disintermediation and infrastructure efficiency, it is no surprise that 80 percent of the world\u2019s largest banks will have initiated blockchain projects by the end of 2017. In capital markets alone, blockchain initiatives will have received as much as $1 billion in investment in 2016. The World Economic Forum has predicted that by 2027, 10 percent of global GDP will be transacted on a blockchain-based system. The financial services industry is taking this technology very seriously, and other industrial sectors are taking notice. Recent use cases for blockchain technology also show revolutionary promise in the area of supply chain management.\n \nIn the mining sector, the world\u2019s largest mining firm by market value, BHP Billiton, announced in September 2016 that it plans to use blockchain technology to record movements of wellbore rock and fluid samples and to further secure the data that is transmitted during delivery. Mining companies coordinate with numerous vendors at nearly each step in the mining process. The effective coordination of these vendors is essential to drive key business decisions. At the Blockchain Summit in Shanghai, Tyler Smith, blockchain project manager at BHP, explained that with blockchain technology, data can be shared between the extraction rig, analysts, engineers and laboratories, creating accountability and a constant understanding of where a sample is; therefore replacing the current system in which samples worth up to $100 million are inefficiently tracked through email and spreadsheets. BHP plans to begin requiring vendors to use this technology to collect live data by the end of 2016.\n \nAs we move into automating the supply chain, one innovator in particular has focused on pairing blockchain technology with another emerging technology \u2014 the Internet of Things (IoT). Filament, a wireless network startup, is building what they believe is the next generation of industrial network technology. By pairing leading edge sensors with a decentralized network, powered with autonomous smart contracts, Filament is creating an industrial network where devices can securely communicate, exchange value and automatically execute actions.\nUpon sensing that it requires a new key piece of machinery, based on predefined conditions, a remote drilling rig outfitted with Filament's \u201cTap\u201d sensors could automatically ping an autonomous drone to deliver the replacement part to the remote location. As the number of connected devices exchanging value among themselves increases exponentially, this network with its consensus-driven ledger will become more powerful and more secure, enabling it to create the next generation of commerce.\n \nAnother innovator, Skuchain, based out of California, is seeking to upgrade the entire supply chain network by utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate document transfers and payments, while using smart contracts to automatically execute these functions. In essence, Skuchain envisions an interconnected supply chain where all parties transact on a shared ledger that can automatically execute functions based on predetermined conditions (for example, automatically sending funds upon the signal that goods have been received at their destination and have met the predetermined criteria).\n \nWe\u2019ve discussed different ways parties in the supply chain can use blockchain technology; however, the front-end usability that connects the blockchain to the user is also crucial. For example, Factom, a blockchain startup focused on record management, has created a scalable layer on top of the Bitcoin blockchain to create \u201cproof of existence\u201d for all records placed on the network. Factom has partnered with financial institutions, legal firms and governments to explore the potential of immutable records management. This solution could be used for land registries, birth certificates, mortgages and invoices. \nTo illustrate the front-end simplicity of a document management blockchain solution, Deloitte Netherlands created a prototype that places warranties onto the blockchain. To enhance usability of such records management applications, a front end enables users to simply scan a QR code on the product warranty slip from within the Messenger app, using a chatbot to upload it onto the blockchain. Users can then interact with the chatbot to receive details about the warranty, find retailers to fix the product or transfer the warranty to a buyer. Imagine this simple, mobile user experience in place at each step in the supply chain, with each party uploading their data, documents and records into an immutable ledger.\n \nAs we move downstream, we see peer-to-peer markets popping up. For instance, a joint venture by ConsenSys and LO3 Energy dubbed the TransActive Grid illustrates blockchain technology\u2019s potential for revolutionizing energy distribution grids. This grid platform enables homeowners with solar panels to sell surplus power on a local \u201cTransactive Microgrid\u201d peer-to-peer market. This market is built on existing utility infrastructure and future smart meters but introduces an integration with the Ethereum network. By using smart contracts run on Ethereum to tokenize surplus power, individual solar producers can sell surplus renewable energy directly to their neighbor, bypassing the markups and fees charged by their utility providers.\nProof of concepts (\u201cPOCs\u201d) developed in partnership with international banks, multinational companies, governments and startups that are focused on solving supply chain inefficiencies are gaining traction and interest across the energy sector. These partnerships are essential to create value-driven prototyping efforts that can be effectively scaled into production.\n \nBorrowing the lessons learned from the financial services industry\u2019s foray into blockchain experimentation, in order to successfully identify initial high-value use cases and coordinate activities across multiple partners and intermediaries, blockchain education is an essential first step. Due to its nascent stage of development and technical complexity, the basic understanding of the applicability of blockchain technology is not yet mainstream.\n \nIf history can serve as an example, educational sessions with energy sector executives, supply chain leaders and industry associations to establish a common knowledge base of blockchain fundamentals will enable the discovery of well-defined use cases that address real business needs. \nThe next step in the innovation cycle is to develop a POC; through rapid development, iterations and failures, a robust prototype can be built to evaluate its effectiveness and feasibility as a solution. These POCs should be focused on solving problems that align with blockchain technology\u2019s value proposition, and which can be built and tested rigorously in a low-risk environment, with the ultimate goal of moving from experimentation to meaningful pilots and eventual deployment in production environments.\n \nFor decades the Canadian energy sector has embraced technological innovation to improve cost structure, enhance extraction of reserves and increase corporate resilience. Blockchain technology has the potential to become the fundamental innovation that streamlines supply chain processes, executes contractual agreements, optimizes trade finance and powers autonomous commerce in the energy industry of the future.\nThis guest post was written with contributions from\u00a0 Iliana Oris Valiente (CPA, CA, CBP).

{"title": "How Bitcoin Unlimited Users May End Up on Different Blockchains", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/how-bitcoin-unlimited-users-may-end-different-blockchains/", "birthday": "Jan 27, 2017  10:53 AM EST", "date": "2017-01-27 15:53:00", "content": "Aaron van Wirdum is interested in decentralized consensus, FOSS, privacy in the digital age, censorship resistant payments, and more of that stereotypical Bitcoin stuff. Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin Unlimited, one of the Bitcoin Core software forks introduced in late 2015, garnered much attention in recent months. The project gained hash power support from several new Bitcoin mining pools, including ViaBTC, GBMiners and BTC.TOP, while node adoption appears to be on the rise as well.\nThe central idea behind Bitcoin Unlimited \u2014 specified in \u201cBitcoin Unlimited Improvement Proposal 001\u201d (BUIP001) \u2014 is to hand control of Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit to users and miners. Or perhaps, more accurately, to make this control more explicit and easier to handle.\nHowever, this control does come at the expense of Bitcoin\u2019s strong and automated consensus mechanism. With BUIP001, there is a number of scenarios in which different users end up on different chains \u2014 either temporarily or permanently.\nHere\u2019s a (probably incomplete) overview.\n(Note: If you are not sure how Bitcoin Unlimited works, do make sure to first read \u201cA Closer Look at Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s Configurable Block Size Proposal.\u201d)\nIf Not Everyone Switches to Bitcoin Unlimited\nThe first example is also the most obvious one.\nIt currently seems very unlikely that different Bitcoin implementations \u2014 like Bitcoin Core, Libbitcoin, BTCD or Bcoin \u2014 will adopt BUIP001, or something compatible. This is especially true because the Bitcoin Unlimited team has not submitted BUIP001 to the cross-implementation Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process; most implementations therefore don\u2019t even have the proposal under consideration.\nBut if not all significant Bitcoin implementations adopt BUIP001 or a compatible solution, the blockchain cannot converge in the way Bitcoin Unlimited proponents envisage. Instead, if a majority of miners (by hash power) increases Maximum Generation Size (MG) and Excessive Block Size (EB) to produce blocks bigger than one megabyte, Bitcoin would split into two incompatible networks and currencies, not unlike Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\nHowever, because this split would not be coordinated or include safety precautions, the consequences could be much worse than the split between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\nOne megabyte users would experience inconveniences, and even more so if their hash power initially represents a smaller minority. This would include (much) slower block confirmations, perhaps even to the point where their chain becomes almost unusable (at least temporarily). Additionally, they are at risk of replay attacks if they want to use the \u201cBitcoin Unlimited chain\u201d as well.\nBitcoin Unlimited users would suffer similar inconveniences, though their initial block confirmations wouldn\u2019t be as slow, as they\u2019d have support from the hash-power majority. \nTo counter that, however, Bitcoin Unlimited users would be unsure as to whether \u201ctheir\u201d chain would continue to exist at all. If the one megabyte chain should ever overtake the \u201cBitcoin Unlimited chain\u201d in length (really: total proof of work), Bitcoin Unlimited nodes would automatically switch back to the one megabyte chain. Accordingly, they would dispose of (\u201corphan\u201d) the entire \u201cBitcoin Unlimited chain\u201d since the split, even if that chain is thousands of blocks deep. All \u201ctheir\u201d transactions would be forgotten, perhaps costing lots of people lots of money.\nIf a group of hardcore one-megabyte supporters and speculators can make this scenario seem even slightly plausible, self-fulfilling prophecy dynamics can pose an existential threat to the \u201cBitcoin Unlimited chain\u201d: no one wants to hold value on the chain that may be discarded.\nIf Everyone Does Switch to Bitcoin Unlimited\nBut let\u2019s assume the switch to BUIP001 goes smoothly. All significant Bitcoin implementations adopt the new configurable options, and all users and miners update their software accordingly.\nOnce again \u2014 even in this scenario \u2014 there is no technical reason that all users will converge on a single chain in a meaningful way. Different users can configure their nodes to remain out of consensus for the rest of their lives.\nAs a simple example, a minority of miners can configure both MG and EB to one megabyte, while they set Excessive Acceptance Depth (AD) to 10,000,000. In other words, these nodes will mimic the current one-megabyte block size limit for about two centuries \u2014 regardless of what the rest of the network does.\nMeanwhile, a majority of miners can set MG and EB to create and accept blocks up to two megabytes. \nNow, as soon as one miner mines a two-megabyte block, the majority of miners will build on this block and extend this chain. The minority of miners, however, ignores this chain practically forever: exactly as described in the previous section of this article. \nAnd it would include the same risks as previously described as well. If the one-megabyte chain ever overtakes the two-megabyte chain in length, the two-megabyte chain is completely discarded. Even after thousands of blocks.\nIf Everyone Limits AD to Four Confirmations\nBitcoin Unlimited users can have a stronger degree of convergence on a single chain by technical means, if they keep their AD setting relatively low. The default setting in Bitcoin Unlimited is four: An excessive block requires four blocks mined on top of it to be considered valid.\nBut this presents problems as well.\nThe first problem is that even with this low default, any transaction with less than five confirmations is much less secure than it is now. Say a transaction shows three confirmations in a user\u2019s wallet. That user has no way of knowing whether an alternative blockchain is being mined with a competing (double-spent) transaction, that already has four confirmations. This could happen at any time.\nIf that alternative chain reaches its fifth confirmation first, the user\u2019s chain is discarded, and his incoming transaction lost \u2014 even though it had three confirmations.\nOf course, \u201corphaned blocks\u201d do already exist, and users that require more security should wait for more confirmations.\nBut barring exotic and expensive types of malicious attacks, three orphaned blocks can currently really only result from freak coincidence. Different groups of miners must coincidentally find three blocks at almost exactly the same time, three separate and subsequent coincidences, in order for the network to experience that many orphans.\nBitcoin Unlimited, on the other hand, throws a new factor into the mix, adding a reason for the network to experience three orphaned blocks. Miners not only race to extend the longest valid chain, but also vote on protocol rules between chains. This process would also be visible and quite predictable for attackers, and therefore easily exploitable.\nThe second problem is that having to keep AD at the default of four confirmations for security reasons essentially defeats the purpose of BUIP001. While Bitcoin Unlimited is supposed to hand control of the block size limit over to both users and (all) miners, low AD levels ensure that even the slightest majority of miners can always overrule local block size settings by simply mining a series of bigger blocks. This makes MG and EB meaningless for everyone else: \u201cplacebo controls.\u201d\nIndeed, AD proposes an odd choice: Either nodes and miners set a high AD for relative autonomy, but risk splitting the network with potentially harmful consequences; or these nodes and miners pick a low AD to improve the level of convergence \u2014 but only because they effectively give up control to a majority of miners. (And if the intention is to give up control to a majority of miners, there are more straightforward solutions available.)\nUnder Adversarial Conditions\nThings get worse under adversarial conditions. \nIf not everyone wants what\u2019s best for Bitcoin, and instead some entities \u2014 for whatever reason \u2014 would rather see Bitcoin fail, the security assumptions of BUIP001 degrade further. And the more funds an adversary has at its disposal to cause turmoil, the worse Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s convergence mechanism would perform.\nFirst off, node signaling is trivially spoofed. Anyone with the resources to spin up \u201cfake\u201d (economically irrelevant) nodes could pretend that there is widespread user support for a certain block size limit level, while in reality there is not. If miners go by these signals, they may fork the chain with less user support than expected.\nAdditionally, a malicious miner can often split the network. Such a miner could monitor the EB levels signaled by other miners (which is not as easily spoofed), and intentionally mine a block that falls right in between what these miners will accept. If some 50 percent of hash power accepts blocks up to two megabytes, and the other 50 percent supports bigger blocks, a 2.01 megabyte block would be ignored by the first 50 percent, and accepted by the other 50 percent.\nAssuming the default AD of four is maintained, the chain could split for more than an hour. As explained in the previous section, the Bitcoin network(s) would be very unreliable during this period, as the chain on either side of the split may be discarded. \nAn adversary controlling only 0.7 percent of global hash power could cause this level of turmoil about once every day. And unless the overwhelming majority of miners already agree on their EB anyways, that sweet spot to abuse the network should always exist.\nFurthermore, as a result of this attack, half of all miners would reach their AD thresholds, opening their \u201csticky gates.\" This may allow for a second wave of attacks. Now, the malicious miner has about 24 hours to mine an even larger block, that \u2014 ironically \u2014 only the initially smaller-block side of the chain would accept because their sticky gates are open, and the initially larger-block side of the chain would reject. This would create another split.\nLast, if and when this new \"sticky gate chain\" reaches the AD thresholds of the remaining nodes, all sticky gates are open, and there is no block size limit at all. An adversary can now mine blocks that are so big they may fragment the chain as not all nodes can keep up \u2014 perhaps due to bandwidth constraints, latency or other machine limits.\u00a0\nEmergent Consensus\nWhile Bitcoin Unlimited arguably offers more personal autonomy to users, it does not ensure technical blockchain convergence. But this is not new. To some extent, it is even touched on in Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s FAQ.\nYet, Bitcoin Unlimited proponents do expect users to converge on a single blockchain. This is explained by what is perhaps best considered Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s underlying philosophy: \u201cEmergent Consensus.\u201d \nRather than a purely technical mechanism, Emergent Consensus is a conviction that all participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem have a strong enough (economic) incentive to find consensus on a single blockchain, even if their software does not do this\u00a0automatically.\nThe next article will take a closer look at this Emergent Consensus philosophy.\nAuthor\u2019s note: This article is not a complete overview of all the problems that could result from BUIP001. Most importantly, it ignores trade-offs and weaknesses that derive from an oversized (or floating) block size limit itself, like node centralization, miner centralization, or fee economics, to instead focus on (a lack of) blockchain convergence.\n\u201cJonny1000\u201d contributed to this article.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 27}

The German multinational corporation, which is one of the world\u2019s leading automotive groups, intends to launch its own electronic payment services provider under the \u201cMercedes pay\u201d brand name.\nDaimler Financial Services, which provides financing, leasing, insurance, fleet management, insurance services, banking and credit/debit cards services in more than 40 countries, recently expanded its portfolio to offer mobility services under the brands car2Go (a leading car-sharing service), mytaxi, Mercedes-Benz Rent and moovel. \u201cMercedes pay\u201d will be integrated into Daimler Mobility Services, a subsidiary of Daimler Financial Services, with a number of different mobility services. The company plans to use the new payment system to facilitate car financing and related transactions.\n\u201cWe invest in the future of mobility and are a pioneer in the realm of innovative mobility services,\u201d notes the mobility services website. \u201cWith smartphone based mobility concepts, we optimize the use of existing transportation infrastructure and develop flexible and ecofriendly mobility solutions of the future.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Mercedes pay\u2019 is a fundamental component of our mobility and digitization strategy,\u201d said Bodo Uebber, member of the Daimler Board of Management. \u201cDaimler\u2019s new payment system underscores our ambition, as a leading provider of digital mobility services, to make the products and services we offer even more appealing.\u201d \n\u201cOur philosophy is to provide mobility at your fingertips,\u201d added Klaus Entenmann, chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler Financial Services. \u201c\u2018Mercedes pay\u2019 allows our customers to easily and securely pay for our mobility offerings and services using their smartphones. \u2018Mercedes pay\u2019 will mainly benefit customers who, in the future, will only need to provide their payment details one time, in order to be able to use a range of Daimler\u2019s services. This is made possible by the eWallet function, a virtual source of payment.\u201d\nPayCash Europe, founded in 2012 and headquartered in Luxembourg, offers a digital payment platform for mobile payments, e-money, voucher and loyalty solutions, and digital currencies. The company has an e-money license, issued by the Luxembourg financial supervisory body CSSF (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier), which allows it to operate as a one-stop payment partner.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that digital currencies, including bitcoin, are prominently featured in the service portfolio of PayCash. \u201cGet your business ready for virtual currencies,\u201d says the company. \u201cWhether you are operating a bitcoin exchange or a merchant business that wants to offer its customers bitcoins as a payment solution, our backend solution provides the technical and legal platform to implement the virtual currency into the existing payment infrastructure and enables payments to be processed in all major fiat currencies.\u201d\nThe PayCash platform enables bitcoin exchanges to run fiat currency accounts in the most traded currencies, managed through connections to the banking system. \u201cWe are able to offer your business a merchant account for the exchange and a dedicated E-wallet for your customers and exchange users,\u201d claims the company. \u201cFinally, to make our platform the best fit for your business, PayCash offers a Full KYC (Know Your Customer) service.\u201d\nSince digital currency solutions are but one component of PayCash service offerings, the acquisition does not necessarily imply that bitcoin will be part of \u201cMercedes pay\u201d or other Daimler mobility services. However, the Daimler press release explicitly mentions that PayCash \u201coffers solutions for cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and eWallet systems, in addition to mobile payment services.\u201d Digital currencies are now part of Daimler\u2019s infrastructure, and the company has in-house industry-standard and KYC/AML-compliant means to offer digital currency options to its customers.

Aside from the ethical and practical issues of building the border wall, the issue of how it will be financed was also raised by opponents during his campaign. Trump\u2019s proposed solution to funding the wall is either to heavily tax U.S.\u2013Mexico remittances or to fully prohibit them altogether, so that the funds needed to build the wall will stay in the U.S.\nAccording to the World Bank, U.S.\u2013based Mexican immigrants send around $26 billion annually to their families back home in Mexico. Trump\u2019s proposed legislation would hit Mexican families that rely on remittances from their U.S.\u2013based relatives hard. The Mexican economy would also suffer as the multibillion-dollar remittance inflow to Mexico adds substantially to the country\u2019s domestic spending. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn light of Trump\u2019s proposed policies to fund the border wall, remittances from the U.S. to Mexico jumped to a ten-year high after Trump\u2019s election win in November in anticipation of possible legislation restricting cross-border money transfers to Mexico. Remittances in the month of November jumped by almost 25 percent compared to the same month the prior year, according to data collated by the Mexican central bank. \nWill Bitcoin Be the Answer if New Legislation Is Imposed?\nIf U.S.\u2013Mexico remittances using traditional channels such as banks or large money transfer operators (MTOs), such as Western Union or MoneyGram, are to be heavily taxed or severely restricted, then bitcoin remittances could offer a solution. \nBitcoin allows users to send and receive money from and to anywhere in the world at a very low cost using online or mobile wallets to make the transfer. Furthermore, legal restrictions on money transfers could easily be circumvented using the digital currency, as no paperwork needs to be filed when sending money abroad. That way, both documented and undocumented Mexican immigrants would still be able to send money back home without any restrictions, should the new laws be put in place. \u00a0\u00a0\nAlternatively to bitcoin, anonymous digital currencies such as DASH, Monero or Zcash could also be used to make cross-border money transfers, should Trump decide to go through with his legislation and attempt to crack down on bitcoin remittances. \nBitcoin in Mexico\nThe main reason bitcoin hasn\u2019t taken any notable market share of the $500 billion global remittance market is the challenge of transferring fiat currency into bitcoin and then bitcoin back into fiat currency without having to pay too much in bid/offer spread costs. Illiquid local exchanges in developing countries can easily hike up the cost of the remittance to the extent that it would make more sense to use traditional money transfer solutions. \nFortunately, for Mexican bitcoin users, there are several exchanges to choose from when needing to convert bitcoin into pesos or vice versa. Mexico\u2019s main bitcoin exchanges include Bitso, Volabit and LocalBitcoins. \nGiven the liquidity of both U.S-based, Mexico-based and international exchanges that residents of the two nations have access to, the costs of converting bitcoin to and from fiat currency are reasonable low, making bitcoin remittances from the U.S. to Mexico a viable solution should Trump\u2019s remittance restrictions be enforced. Furthermore, there are bitcoin remittance companies such as Abra and Cashaa that aim to make cashing out bitcoins in local fiat currency easier. \u00a0\nIn terms of bitcoin regulation, Mexico has taken a stance similar to many of its international peers. In April 2014, Mexico\u2019s National Commission for the Protection and Defense of Users of Financial Services issued a warning on the risks of using bitcoin stating that it is not legal tender and not regulated by the Mexican authorities. Therefore, the commission warned, \u201cany individual or business that uses or accepts virtual currencies as a means of payment does so at their own risk and on their own responsibility because the use of this type of asset entails high volatility and potential monetary losses.\u201d In other words, bitcoin is not illegal but the commission warns against its use due to the risks involved in dealing in the digital currency. \nNot surprisingly, following Trump\u2019s election win in November, bitcoin trading volumes in Mexico on global peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitcoins and on the country\u2019s leading bitcoin exchange, Bitso, increased substantially as Mexican bitcoin users moved funds away from the weakening peso and into a better-performing currency. \nShould Trump succeed in imposing strict remittance restrictions from the U.S. to Mexico, this could become the first case study of bitcoin remittance succeeding and actually become a viable means to make cross-border payments. \u00a0", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 31}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin Unlimited, one of the Bitcoin Core software forks introduced in late 2015, garnered much attention in recent months. The project gained hash power support from several new Bitcoin mining pools, including ViaBTC, GBMiners and BTC.TOP, while node adoption appears to be on the rise as well.\nThe central idea behind Bitcoin Unlimited \u2014 specified in \u201cBitcoin Unlimited Improvement Proposal 001\u201d (BUIP001) \u2014 is to hand control of Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit to users and miners. Or perhaps more accurately: to make this control more explicit and easier to handle.\nBut as explained in \u201cHow Bitcoin Unlimited Users May End Up on Different Blockchains,\u201d BUIP001 does not include a technical consensus mechanism as reliable as in Bitcoin\u2019s current consensus rules.\nInstead, Bitcoin Unlimited relies on a philosophy often referred to as \u201cEmergent Consensus.\u201d\n(Note: If you are not sure how Bitcoin Unlimited works, or what the technical weaknesses of BUIP001 are, make sure to first read \u201cA Closer Look at Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s Configurable Block Size Proposal\u201d and \u201cHow Bitcoin Unlimited Users May End Up on Different Blockchains.\u201d)\n\u201cEmergent Consensus\u201d\nBUIP001 does not ensure machine consensus; users can configure their nodes to split into different blockchains, either intentionally or unintentionally. Instead, Bitcoin Unlimited relies on \u201cEmergent Consensus.\u201d This is a conviction that participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem have a strong enough economic incentive to converge on a single blockchain, such that they will converge on a single blockchain. If their software does not automatically realize this, users are expected to configure their settings to make it happen. After all, it benefits everyone to be on the same blockchain and to be able to transact with one another.\nHow this Emergent Consensus should form is not really documented, however. While some have made analogies \u2014 with flocks of birds, for example \u2014 it\u2019s not clear how these apply to Bitcoin, exactly.\nThat said, it is possible to draw out a scenario that many Bitcoin Unlimited proponents roughly envisage. As a first step, users should signal what size of blocks they will accept with the Excessive Block Size (EB) setting. Then, miners \u2014 incentivized to satisfy market demand \u2014 should increase (or decrease) the block size limit accordingly. Finally, if these new blocks exceed some users\u2019 EB, these users are expected to follow regardless, either because their Excessive Acceptance Depth (AD) setting is triggered, or maybe because they\u2019ll reconfigure their nodes manually.\nAs explained in \u201cHow Bitcoin Unlimited Users May End Up on Different Blockchains,\u201d this scenario does present some problems. For one, if a user\u2019s EB signaling is trivially spoofed by an adversary, miners can be tricked into thinking a block size limit increase has more support than it does \u2014 or perhaps malicious miners can themselves trick users. \nAnd for the (remaining) users, this scenario presents an odd choice: Either they set their AD settings low to remain in consensus, but essentially give up much of their autonomy to miners; or they set their AD settings high to protect their autonomy, but risk splitting the network.\nOff-Chain Coordination\nTo counter some of the problems described, Emergent Consensus can also be established through debate on forums, blog posts, chat rooms and other media. Realistically, it may even require this kind of off-chain coordination, to some extent.\nFor example, while mining pool ViaBTC wants to hard fork to a two-megabyte block size limit, that is not what the pool is currently signaling with its EB settings. If it did, that could be abused to split the network. Instead, ViaBTC signals support for one megabyte and in their \u201cminer guide\u201d proposes to hard fork to two megabytes once at least 75 percent of hash power acknowledges support.\nHowever, this kind of off-chain coordination is not unique. Groups of people have coordinated and achieved consensus through discourse for a long time. But such systems often either have a leader or tend to break down and split into factions once the number of participants reaches a certain size. Other popular open-source projects, for example, sometimes consist of hundreds of incompatible forks.\nAnd this is probably even more true under adversarial conditions. If the people in these groups don\u2019t really know or trust one another, they have no way of knowing whether the other people are telling the truth or lying. Even a single adversary can pretend to be many users and communicate many false preferences. This makes coordination and reaching consensus a very difficult problem to solve.\nIn fact, this is the Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem. That is exactly the problem Satoshi Nakamoto attempted to address.\nWith a track record of about eight years, Bitcoin\u2019s main technological achievement is a math-based protocol that realizes strong, fast, scalable and automated machine consensus for large groups of people who do not necessarily know or trust one another. Bitcoin is reasonably \u201cByzantine Fault tolerant.\u201d\nBitcoin Unlimited proponents believe that Bitcoin\u2019s economic incentives \u2014 the incentive for users to all remain part of the same Bitcoin blockchain \u2014 is in itself sufficiently Byzantine Fault tolerant. But that is, so far, largely unproven. No altcoin relies on similar assumptions, nor is there a publicly available testnet where the BUIP001 configurations are actively used.\nWhat Bitcoin Unlimited Changes\nThat said, part of the same Bitcoin Unlimited philosophy is that Bitcoin relies on a sort of Emergent Consensus anyway.\nRather than merely relying on math, code or protocol, many really see Bitcoin as a consensus between people first and foremost. People choose to partake in the system, people give it value, and sometimes \u2014 like during the August 2010 and March 2013 blockchain forks \u2014 people have to coordinate \u201coff-chain\u201d to determine which chain is valid.\n\nAs such, BUIP001 doesn\u2019t fundamentally change anything. Users choose to run Bitcoin Unlimited. Node software can already be (re-)compiled. And a social consensus may have to form \u201coff-chain\u201d either way.\nBut by making this control more explicit and easier to handle, and assuming users actually use these options, Bitcoin Unlimited does rely on the human consensus aspect to a much larger extent. Rather than opting into a protocol once and relying on machine consensus from then on, users need to take on a much more proactive role. As one Bitcoin Unlimited proponent noted, shortly after miners had to reconfigure their nodes in response to a bug that briefly forked the network earlier this week: \u201cThis IS part of how Bitcoin works. It\u2019s not meant for people sleeping at the wheel.\u201d \nIt is true that BUIP001 doesn\u2019t introduce anything that wasn\u2019t possible before. As an open-source project, users and miners could always recompile their Bitcoin software to do anything that Bitcoin Unlimited allows. But of course, that in itself is not an argument in favor of BUIP001. Just because users could, that does not mean they should.\nSo far, Bitcoin has had several forks that lasted for several blocks, caused by technical failures. The August 2010 blockchain fork was needed to revert the creation of billions of bitcoins out of thin air, which required orphaning an hour-long chain. The only reason that the event wasn\u2019t catastrophic is that bitcoin was hardly used as money back then. During the March 2013 blockchain fork, however, the network was unreliable for real users, and at least one person was double-spent, while several miners wasted valuable resources mining an orphaned chain. The same is true for the July 2015 blockchain fork, where miners were urged to switch to fully validating mining pools, and many have learned from that mistake.\nIndeed, developers, miners and the rest of the Bitcoin community have generally tried to avoid these types of crisis events as much as they possibly can.\nIn contrast, Bitcoin Unlimited seems to embrace them as an upgrade mechanism. \n\u201cJonny1000\u201d contributed to this article.\nAuthor's note: An earlier version of this article suggested there is no testnet for BUIP001 at all. Since publication, it was pointed out there actually is such a testnet, dubbed \"nolnet\". This testnet is not really publicly available, however, and seems to be used only by a small group of developers close to the Bitcoin Unlimited project. And of course, by definition a testnet does\u00a0not\u00a0test economic incentives either way, so these remain unproven.", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 1}

At the time, he found he agreed with the company\u2019s approach to business. \n\u201cShapeShift\u2019s non-custodial model takes full advantage of a blockchain\u2019s capabilities to allow disparate parties to transact with each other with little-to-no knowledge,\u201d Perklin told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cTheir lack of collecting user information further highlights the power that blockchains bring to the world. We don\u2019t need to know who each other are to be able to swap one digital asset for another, and ShapeShift\u2019s innovation in this space was a large reason behind my move.\n\u201cShapeShift\u2019s power is in its simplicity \u2014 send a token, receive another. No accounts, no passports, no utility bills.\u201d\n\u201cIt has been an absolute honor and privilege to work with Michael,\u201d Erik Voorhees, CEO of ShapeShift, told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cand having him on board with us full-time now is a dream come true for a blockchain startup.\u201d \nAn expert in cyber investigations, digital forensic examinations and security breach post-mortems, Perklin founded Canada\u2019s first blockchain security consulting firm, Bitcoinsultants, and is the co-author of the first CryptoCurrency Security Standard. Perklin will continue in his role as president of C4, a nonprofit standards organization dedicated to developing and maintaining standards and personnel certification to help companies more effectively use blockchain technology. \n\u201cMichael Perklin has pioneered the standardization of security-related best practices in the industry. He\u2019s a talented individual of immense character, and happens to be one of the world\u2019s foremost blockchain security experts,\u201d said Voorhees.\n\u201cAs a ShapeShift integration partner, I think it\u2019s great to see someone of Michael\u2019s capabilities join their team,\u201d Anthony Di Iorio, CEO of Decentral and Jaxx Blockchain Interface, concurred. \u201cI've known Michael for a number of years and he\u2019s always been at the forefront of blockchain forensics and security. Directing his skills and experience full-time to ShapeShift is a huge win for their company.\u201d\n\u201c2017 Is the Year of Blockchains\u201d\nAs a long-time Bitcoin advocate, Perklin has testified about blockchains at the Canadian Senate\u2019s Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce and has been qualified as an expert witness in the courts of Canada and other nations around the globe. \n\u201cBlockchains definitely are a game-changing technology, just like databases changed things back in the \u201960s. I do think 2017 is the year of blockchains simply because of all of the work people are doing around the world to integrate this new computer science concept with existing business processes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like how companies traded their filing cabinets for computers and envelopes for fax machines. When new technologies change our environment, we integrate them into our daily lives and adjust. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that blockchains will change society more quickly and more drastically than the internet did in the \u201990s and 2000s.\u201d\nUnlike those who doubt that bitcoin can survive as a digital currency, Perklin sees a natural progression toward widespread use and acceptance.\n\u201cBitcoin and blockchain technologies are quite different from everything that existed before them, so it\u2019s no surprise that some media outlets misunderstand it and jump to conclusions. Bitcoin has been called untraceable (false), anonymous (false) and has been declared dead by misinformed people more times than I can count.\n\u201cBy comparison, the internet was seen as something that was only useful for computer geeks. However, once people understand a new technology, they begin to use it in their everyday lives. I think Bitcoin and blockchains will be no different.\u201d\nOn Ethereum\nPerklin is also enthusiastic about the future of Ethereum, despite some recent doom and gloom predictions.\n\u201cEther is an interesting token with a different use case than bitcoin. It\u2019s such a new technology that there are bound to be growing pains \u2014 it\u2019s the first of its kind, just like Bitcoin was the first of its kind, too,\u201d says Perklin. \u201cMany people forget that Bitcoin went through many \u2018hard forks\u2019 in its first two years, just as Ethereum is doing now. As each bug is fixed, the system becomes more resilient to problems. I have a bright view for Ethereum\u2019s future. \n\u201cThere are now so many digital assets \u2014 each with their own unique differences \u2014 that people around the world will undoubtedly need to swap amongst them regularly.\u201d\nBefore joining ShapeShift, \u00a0Perklin was Head of Security and Investigative Services with LedgerLabs, a Canadian blockchain services firm that offers advice on strategy, development, security and training to companies working with or hoping to work with blockchain technology.\nThe LedgerLabs team is comprised of experts in Ethereum, permissioned blockchains, smart contracts and blockchain forensics, including Vitalik Buterin, Peter Todd, Jeff Coleman, Hai Nguyen, Richard Moore and Vlad Zamfir.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 27}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nAs the Dutch proverb goes: \u201cThe soup is not eaten as hot as it is served.\u201d Meaning: The threat is often not carried through as thoroughly as initially presented.\nBitcoin Magazine recently reported that the investigative arm of the Dutch tax authority \u2014 the FIOD \u2014 wants to lower the bar for prosecution of unlicensed bitcoin traders. As part of that effort, the FIOD aims to have mixing services recognized as money-laundering indicators. Users of mixing services would be assumed guilty, Dutch financial newspaper Financieele Dagblad (FD) wrote, unless they could prove otherwise.\nThe FIOD has now nuanced these reports. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, the press officer for the tax authority explained that recognizing something as a money laundering indicator does not mean it will be illegal in and of itself. \n\u201cBut it does mean it indicates money laundering,\u201d he added.\nExpanding on this reasoning, the press officer explained that the tax agency established a money-laundering typology that includes several factors.\nThese include, for example, the location where a transaction is made; a public space like a McDonald\u2019s is more suspect than a regular office. \u201cSimilarly, whether or not the exchanger keeps an administration, what kind of compensation he charges, how the customer is verified, whether physical cash is used, the amounts involved, visibility of the exchanger on public websites or official government records, and whether communication happened in encrypted form,\u201d the press officer said.\nAnd soon, perhaps, also the use of bitcoin mixers.\nDarknet Markets\nBitcoin can be used relatively anonymously. This has made the digital currency a popular means of exchange on darknet markets like AlphaBay and Silk Road, and is also increasingly used for other cybercrimes, such as ransomware. In a report published last year, Europol \u2014 the law enforcement agency of the European Union \u2014 said more than 40 percent of online transactions for illegal ends is made with bitcoin.\nDarknet market merchants typically do exchange their earned bitcoins for fiat currencies. While trading bitcoin for fiat is itself not illegal in The Netherlands, most exchanges apply strict Anti\u2013Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) standards. This is usually required by the banks they work with. \nDarknet merchants, therefore, often prefer to exchange their bitcoins at what the FIOD refers to as \u201cbitcoincashers\u201d: exchanges and dealers that do not comply with such rules. They often offer their services via largely unregulated websites like LocalBitcoins.com, and typically meet up in person to trade bitcoins for cash fiat currency. These bitcoincashers then sell the bitcoins at a regular exchange or brokerage.\nThat\u2019s where some bitcoincashers are caught. If they deposit large amounts and tick too many boxes in the above-mentioned money-laundering typology, an investigation can be started against them. And since all bitcoin transactions are traceable on the blockchain, in some cases, this investigation also leads to the original criminals and their crime.\nThat\u2019s why bitcoincashers as well as the darknet merchants and cybercriminals increasingly make use of bitcoin mixers. On hosted sites, like bitmixer.io, these mixers exchange bitcoins for different bitcoins, to cut all links on the blockchain.\nIf these mixers themselves become a money-laundering indicator, using them would no longer shield the bitcoincashers as effectively.\nPrivacy\nWithin the Bitcoin community itself, many are concerned with the lack of privacy offered by Bitcoin. Not all bitcoin users want the world to know where they spend their money, what they earn or how much they own \u2014 even if they\u2019re not breaking any laws.\nAs such, a series of new mixing instruments have been developed and designed over the past few years. These include JoinMarket, ValueShuffle and TumbleBit, while alternative digital currencies offering increased privacy, like Monero and Zcash, have gained in popularity too.\nWhen asked by Bitcoin Magazine, the FIOD spokesperson did acknowledge that bitcoin mixing can also be done for perfectly valid, privacy-related reasons.\nHe noted, however, \u201cWe believe these use cases do not represent a majority. Compare it to the 500 euro note. This is legal tender (for now). However, when someone pays you with a 500 euro bill you are going to find that suspicious. We believe the same is true for mixing bitcoins.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 2}
{"title": "Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology: The Future of Philanthropy", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-and-blockchain-technology-future-philanthropy/", "birthday": "Feb 3, 2017  4:00 AM EST", "date": "2017-02-03 09:00:00", "content": "Charities supporting children\u2019s causes, victims of humanitarian disasters, the environment, scientific research or the arts raise millions of dollars in donations each year. Yet, while generous contributions continue to be made around the world, public trust and confidence in charities has been reported at its lowest recorded level.\nAccording to a 2016 report from UK Fundraising, a survey of over 1,000 people found that trust in charities has fallen from 6.7 out of 10 in 2014 to 5.7 in 2016. The main reasons for this decline are distrust in how charities spend their donations, a lack of knowledge among the public about where their donations go and media coverage critical of charity practices. \nFurthermore, a 2013 Guardian report suggests that people in the U.K. would donate an extra \u00a3665 million a year to charity if organizations provided additional information about the things they care about, such as evidence of how their donations are impacting a cause and how their money is spent.\nSo how exactly can this issue be rectified for the benefit of charities and those who want to donate to a worthy cause? Enter bitcoin and blockchain technology.\nAlice.si: A Blockchain Philanthropy Platform\nAccording to Rapha\u00ebl Mazet, CEO of Alice.si, a U.K.-based blockchain philanthropy platform, charities are well documented with trust issues, particularly in the U.K. He believes, though, that blockchain technology is useful in addressing these issues.\n\u201c[As] donations can be made conditional to impact, and because everything is recorded immutably and transparently, anyone can verify what charities have achieved,\u201d he said, speaking to Bitcoin Magazine.\nAlice.si is built on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain; its name is an homage to \u201cAlice,\u201d who anecdotally always seems to be sending money to Bob. The \u201c.si\u201d stands for \u201csocial impact.\u201d Using Alice, charities can raise donations based on the transparency of their impact. Once a donation appeal has been launched on Alice, the charity commits to delivering specific outcomes and receives payment only when those outcomes are verified and validated by an independent third party.\nAs part of the Nominet Trust\u2019s Social Tech Seed grant-making program, Alice received just over \u00a345,000 in up-front funding to get the startup off the ground, thus allowing the company to build a track record of trust. \nWhile Mazet states that the use of blockchain technology in charity cases can help to humanize the technology and introduce it to the general public, the company\u2019s main message to donors focuses on how they can track the impact of their donations.\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re trying to reach a mainstream audience, we won\u2019t necessarily put the tech front and center,\u201d he said.\nAs such, Alice\u2019s first pilot with St. Mungo\u2019s, a forward-thinking U.K.-based homeless charity, due to be launched in Q1 of 2017, will be measuring its impact and working on a payment-by-results basis. \nThe platform will not accept donations in digital currencies just yet, however. Mazet explained that Alice is working with Tramonex Labs, which is registered within the sandbox framework of the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, to issue electronic tokens that represent the donations on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\u201cThat means they\u2019ll collateralize and tokenize donations made in fiat on the Alice website so we can use them in our smart contracts,\u201d he said. \u201cIn time, as people become more familiar with the technology, our plan is to empower them to interact with the smart contracts directly, and start donating with cryptocurrencies if they want to.\u201d\nMazet says that Alice will be launching pilots in the first half of 2017 so they can test different use cases with different partners. After that, the idea is to open up to more charities, launching programs outside the U.K., such as in the U.S. and South Africa.\n\u201cThe end game is really to make sure donors can trust the charities they\u2019re funding, and see if we can help tackle some of the world\u2019s really big issues in a demonstrable way.\u201d\nBitGive: Facilitating Bitcoin Donations\nSince the establishment of the BitGive Foundation in 2013, the nonprofit organization has been revolutionizing the way in which people donate to charity; in fact, it is the first 501(c)(3) registered nonprofit in the Bitcoin space.\nConnie Gallippi, founder of BitGive, said to Bitcoin Magazine that the number of donations largely trends with the price of bitcoin; when the price is up, the organization sees more donations.\n\u201cEarly on, it was a novel and interesting way to give, so there was more attention on it in the media,\u201d she said.\nFor BitGive\u2019s projects specifically, it also correlates to the amount of time and effort they have put into a charity or campaign and how much their mission and projects interest potential donors, Gallippi added.\nIn December, BitGive announced the beta launch of GiveTrack, a blockchain-based multidimensional donation platform that provides the ability to transfer, track and provide a permanent record of financial transactions across the globe from beginning to end.\nBy leveraging blockchain technology, GiveTrack enables a high level of confidence in donors, who can see exactly where their donation is going and how the funds are being used. By implementing the technology with charities, Gallippi believes it connects people with the technology.\n\u201cOffering them an explanation as to how this technology can improve the work of charities, and ultimately drive more impact toward causes they care about, makes the technology more approachable and more relevant to a mainstream audience,\u201d she said.\nDespite working with large organizations such as Save the Children, who now accepts bitcoin directly, Gallippi noted that it is BitGive\u2019s role in supporting a new water well built at the Shisango Girls School in Kenya that she is most proud of.\n\u201cThe well has changed so many young lives and will continue to lift up that community for many years to come.\u201d\nGallippi added, though, that while charities will continue to receive cash donations, she believes that Bitcoin and blockchain technology will eventually become more of the norm for giving. Through a cost-effective approach where less fraud and faster transaction times are guaranteed with donor tracking, she said that these organizations will be at the forefront, leading the way to the future of philanthropy.\nHelperbit: A Blockchain Natural Disaster Management Platform\nAccording to the U.N., every year, the total number of people affected by natural disasters reaches approaches 200 million, while 100,000 of those victims die. While the Helperbit website states that 325 million people could be affected by poverty and vulnerable to natural hazards and climate extremes by 2030.\n\u201cBy 2030, there could be 325 million people trapped in poverty and exposed to the full range of natural hazards and climate extremes.\u201d\nUnfortunately, the charity sector has a history of lack of transparency, inefficiency and unfair redistribution of funds, but Helperbit is offering transparency in humanitarian aid through blockchain technology.\nIn December, Legambiente, a nonprofit organization in Italy, teamed up with Helperbit to adopt Bitcoin and blockchain technology. The funds raised will be donated to the \u201cRebirth Has a Young Heart campaign,\u201d which is dedicated to youth entrepreneurs, such as young farmers, in the areas affected by the August and October earthquakes in the region.\nGuido Baroncini Turricchia, CEO and co-founder of Helperbit, told Bitcoin Magazine that since the company\u2019s collaboration with Legambiente, the Swiss Re Foundation and the Swiss Re Centre for Global Dialogue have also created a multisig wallet in Helperbit and donated more than 5 bitcoins. Add that to the other donations the Legambiente charity campaign has received, and they have 6.22 bitcoins in total.\nEven though it\u2019s too early to measure the impact the donations are providing, Turricchia believes that in time they can highlight the advantages of using digital currencies.\n\u201cIn the long-term, more people will buy bitcoins with the purpose of donating them,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment we are mainly shaking the social sensibility of people in Italy, but with greater resources we will be able to increase our efforts worldwide.\u201d\nThrough the Helperbit platform it is possible to analyze the total donations received as well as checking how the funds will be spent. This gives donors the assurance they need that their donations reach their destination, where they can monitor the impact resulting from the economic aid.\nEven though Bitcoin and blockchain technology have often been negatively portrayed and debated for years, Turricchia is of the opinion that this initiative is the best way to show that it is only a tool and, as such, can be used positively.\n\u201cWe are confident that an improvement of the interface for every kind of person merged with the increased social awareness of the worldwide community will bring a widespread adoption because the outcomes will be the best drivers,\u201d he said.\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely to happen straightaway, Turricchia adds that the penetration of the Bitcoin ecosystem in everyday life will also be reflected in the growth of digital currency donations.", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 3}

To extend the mandatory hold on those funds before the hacker could cash out, on June 24, the Ethereum Foundation incented miners to soft fork by releasing Geth version 1.4.8, code-named \u201cDAO Wars.\u201d However, the soft fork was abandoned because of the risk of a denial-of-service attack.\n \nThe Foundation then began work on a hard fork to reverse the DOA transactions. Unlike a soft fork, a hard fork is a radical change in the protocol that all stakeholders in a blockchain need to agree upon to implement.\n \nNot everyone agreed with reversing the DAO funds. Many vehemently opposed it. Yet, as events unfolded, it became clear that Ethereum had no structure in place for settling these differences \u2014 no official forum for discussing the events, and no official voting mechanism. Instead, decisions were being made on the fly.\nAs a result, the broader Ethereum community was awakening to the reality that the Ethereum Foundation and its core developers were the ones holding the cards. And there were clear conflicts of interest: the DAO was founded by former Ethereum developers, and several people in the Ethereum Foundation owned DAO tokens. \u00a0\nStakeholders Not Fully Involved\nTo get the vote needed to push through a hard fork, on July 15, the Ethereum Foundation turned to Carbonvote, an ad hoc polling tool created after the DAO hack. Ether holders were given one vote per ether they held. \u00a0\nBut many questions arose regarding how the vote was handled: whether voters had enough time to vote (the voting window closed in less than 24 hours), who knew about the vote (outside of a blog post, it was only publicized on Twitter and Reddit) and whether enough people even participated to make it legitimate. Only a small percentage of ether holders ever voted. Additionally, questions arose about whether Carbonvote was even an appropriate voting tool. (Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin had previously referred to it as an informal signaling tool to see \u201cwhich way the wind is blowing.\u201d)\n\n\n(Screenshots of https://twitter.com/ethereumproject/status/753877284155777024)\nThe Ethereum Foundation and core developers ignored the interests of the stakeholders to push forward their own agenda for the fork.\n \nThere\u2019s no suggestion that the Ethereum Foundation acted out of anything other than good faith. The problem is the system depends on that good faith \u2014 and the broader Ethereum community now knows it.\nA Fractured Network\nWhen a hard fork goes through, the hope is that everyone switches over to the new protocol and that the old, deprecated chain simply dies off. But in the case of the post-DAO hard fork, that didn\u2019t happen. Several miners, developers and stakeholders remained on the old blockchain, now called Ethereum Classic.\nNow we have two Ethereums. This has divided the once-unified Ethereum community and may dilute its overall influence.\n \nAdditionally, forks create security problems. The fewer nodes a network has (when validators leave the system), the less secure it is from takeover attempts. Forks can also create opportunities for replay attacks, where a valid transaction on one fork can be repeated on the other, wreaking havoc in the system.\nFor maximal security, and the sake of the community, hard forks need to happen in a way that reduces friction and convinces everyone to join the new fork. The fact that this didn\u2019t happen with Ethereum shows that the process lacks consensus.\nHard Forks Are Not Effective for Evolutionary Change\nA few months after the DAO fork, both Ethereum and Ethereum Classic came under a sustained denial-of-service attack. Both currencies followed up with subsequent forks to fix the security problems. Additionally, Ethereum planned three upgrade forks: Homestead (which launched in March 2016), Metropolis and Serenity.\n \nSoft forks and hard forks are becoming an accepted way of life for blockchains, and that is dangerous. Any fork has the potential to become controversial, and those controversies can weaken a network and stall future growth, just as with the post-DAO fork in Ethereum and the seemingly endless Bitcoin block size debate. \u00a0\n \nThe process of evolving the Ethereum protocol needs to happen in an agreed-upon manner, so stakeholders (and core developers) don\u2019t get hit by surprises. All parties have a right to know beforehand how issues will be resolved.\nFuture blockchains need built-in governance systems. Whenever possible, decisions should happen on chain, not on Reddit or Twitter or some off-site polling tool. And, as part of that governance system, blockchains also need a testnet, so stakeholders can review protocol changes before implementing them.\nBut whether upgrades happen on the blockchain or off, the decision-making process needs to be clear, accountable and decentralized. The fact that the post-DAO fork was none of these is what will cost Ethereum in the long run.\nThis guest post is by Kathleen Breitman, COO of Tezos (tezos.com), a new blockchain platform currently in development.

Furthermore, the blockchain strategy also aims to facilitate company incorporations for Emiratis, expats and foreign investors by creating a blockchain-based incorporation system. \nAs the UAE aims to become a leader in blockchain technology, it would be extremely surprising if its regulators would then stunt innovation in this area by restricting or prohibiting the use of digital currencies. Hence, any future bitcoin regulations in the UAE will most likely favor blockchain startups and the bitcoin economy.", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 6}

They not only invest time and financial support, but also provide a robust network for startups to connect to as they navigate the pitfalls common among early-stage businesses.\nVaultoro currently has over 4,000 clients from 92 countries that hold more than 1.8 million euros\u2019 worth of bitcoin and gold through the platform. By joining Techstars, says Vaultoro CEO Joshua Scigala, the company is putting their plan to integrate the euro on the fast track, and to provide a physical gold-backed VISA card and a sleek new app that allows bank independence while maintaining online shopping and bill paying functionality. \n\u201cTechstars has a massive network of mentors and connections. If we need a warm contact to almost anyone they will be able to make it happen. Our goal at Vaultoro is to enable as many people as possible to be able to easily exit debt-based fiat and jump into securing and spending physical allocated gold and bitcoin.\u201d \nIn the short amount of time that he\u2019s been involved with Berlin Techstars, Scigala says that he\u2019s already garnered a vast amount of experience, noting that it\u2019s \u201clike being put into a pressure cooker of influence and ideas.\u201d \n\u201cThe great thing about Techstars is that they\u2019re all about getting companies to be as successful as possible in the shortest time possible. Having Techstars invest in Vaultoro will help us reach the mass market, which ultimately helps us in promoting private asset-based money like bitcoin and physical allocated gold to the mainstream.\u201d \nGlass Books and the Value of Transparency\nAnd in another move, Vaultoro is seeding the development of a \u201cglass books\u201d system, a transparent protocol based on blockchain technology that fosters financial institution transparency while maintaining client data privacy. \nAs one of the victims of MtGox, Scigala says that this crucial move toward greater transparency will help prove that Vaultoro is at full reserves all the time. \u201cIf MtGox had what we had, then red flags would have popped up all over the place and people would have left the exchange way before it got so bad.\u201d \nScigala says that this level of transparency is critically important because if exchanges in the bitcoin industry do not self-regulate, as Vaultoro intends to do, then another MtGox-type event could likely happen somewhere in the world. This sort of catastrophic event, he says, could be the ideal fuel that the legacy banking system needs to force governments around the world to push draconian regulations onto Bitcoin startups that will cause them to drown under massive regulatory burdens.\n\u201cI really want other exchanges in the Bitcoin industry to follow our lead as being the most transparent exchange in the industry. I also want users to choose exchanges that have a solid transparency protocol in place and walk away from ones that don\u2019t.\u201d \nVaultoro and the Global Markets\nGlobal monetary uncertainty in countries like Venezuela, India and China has had an impact on Vaultoro\u2019s growth, says Scigala. \u201cWe have many clients from these countries. When the Greek banking crisis happened we received a massive uptick in signups from Greek IP addresses. About three months after it happened a lot more people from Greece started to hold allocated gold in the Pro Aurum Swiss Vaults that we connect to.\u201d \nThe reason the Greeks like Vaultoro, he says, is because it is allocated gold. \u201cWe cannot gamble with their savings like banks do, and are obviously not in a position to do bailouts or bail-ins. They know their savings are just sitting safely in a top-tier vaulting facility, audited and insured. And even if we go broke it doesn't matter because our clients\u2019 gold is off our balance sheet.\u201d\n \nWhile Scigala recognizes the growing buzz around blockchain technology, for him it is bitcoin, the token, that is most exciting.\n\u201cI mean it\u2019s money being disrupted that we are talking about! Something we all use every day. There is no need to put gold as a token on the blockchain because it makes it unallocated and opens a massive regulatory can of worms. Bitcoin is so fast we don't need to tokenize gold. In the end it\u2019s about jumping in and out of it on Vaultoro when you need to. That\u2019s why Satoshi invented bitcoin in the first place. We\u2019ll look to Techstars Berlin to help us with this proposition.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 8}

Now, Bitfury and NAPR have signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to expand the blockchain solutions developed by the project to other government departments.\n\u201cThere is a great deal of unrest around the world due to broken and friction-filled systems, and governments, institutions and businesses are looking for better solutions that can serve the people and help make systems more secure and work better overall,\u201d Jamie Smith, global chief communications and marketing officer at the Bitfury Group, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cSolutions like the Bitcoin Blockchain Land-Titling Project in the Republic of Georgia, created in collaboration with the Bitfury Group and the Blockchain Trust Accelerator, will address these challenges head-on and deliver real results \u2014 these are very exciting times.\u201d\nThe Bitfury Group, a full-service blockchain technology company infrastructure provider, develops and delivers blockchain-based software and hardware solutions for businesses, governments, organizations and individuals. In partnership with New America and the National Democratic Institute, Bitfury runs the Blockchain Trust Accelerator to develop blockchain-based solutions for social impact and governance challenges. The company has raised $90 million in funding, including a recent $30 million investment by Credit China Fintech Holdings.\nThe Bitfury Group and NAPR implemented a custom-designed blockchain system that is now integrated into the digital records system of NAPR. This private, permissioned blockchain is anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain through a distributed digital timestamping service. Distributed digital timestamping allows NAPR to verify and sign a document containing a citizen\u2019s essential information and proof of ownership of property.\nThe importance and disruptive potential of the project lies in its ability to make land titles \u2014 and, in general, property rights \u2014 available to billions of people who are currently unable to legally register their property. Blockchain technology also permits significant time and cost savings in the registration process. Therefore, the blockchain land-titling project could have a big global impact beyond Georgia.\n\u201cA secure property registry built on the Blockchain can secure billions of dollars in assets and make a significant social and economic impact globally by addressing the rapidly growing demand need for transparency and accountability,\u201d said Bitfury in a statement. \n\u201cI have dedicated my life to improving access to capital, and our work in the Republic of Georgia is the first in a series of many important steps to bringing corruption-proof digital systems to all,\u201d added Hernando de Soto, president of the Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD), known for his work on the informal economy and on the importance of business and property rights.\nNAPR is \u201cvery pleased with the technical progress and looks forward to continuing [their] fruitful collaboration,\u201d said NAPR Chairman Papuna Ugrekhelidze. \u201cBlockchain technology is the solution for the 21st century, and is its most secure and innovative system.\u201d\nForbes notes that Georgia is fertile ground for blockchain-based innovation in public services, because the country has a solid software infrastructure already in place. \u201cWe will be able to work with blockchain technology from this summer [to] place real estate extracts in a totally safe and innovative system,\u201d said Georgia\u2019s Minister of Justice Tea Tsulukiani, adding that the Ministry of Justice of Georgia is \u201cthe leading ministry in the field of new technologies in terms of e-government, together with two other colleague ministries.\u201d\n\u201cIf you think about this happening at a time when a lot of people are struggling to separate what\u2019s real from what\u2019s fake, this is a powerful tool to prove what\u2019s real,\u201d said Tomicah Tillemann, co-founder of the Blockchain Trust Accelerator and the director of the Bretton Woods II program at New America, as reported by Forbes. \u201cEspecially when you\u2019re dealing with something as fundamental as your home or property, it\u2019s important to have that added layer of security that\u2019s provided by blockchain validation.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 8}
{"title": "Book Review: Reinventing Remittances with Bitcoin", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/book-review-reinventing-remittances-bitcoin/", "birthday": "Feb 7, 2017  3:02 PM EST", "date": "2017-02-07 20:02:00", "content": "News about immigrants, refugees and guest workers has received a massive amount of media attention of late. Amid this political clamor, questions are being increasingly raised about the future of cross-border remittances and monetary exchange. With this, a new book entitled \u201cReinventing Remittances With Bitcoin\u201d aims to usher in the next new normal of cross-border financial transactions.\nWith a message directed toward Bitcoin enthusiasts, entrepreneurs and industry veterans, this compact 47-page read offers a deep dive into the emerging frontier of Bitcoin-powered remittance. \nThis book is chock-full of stories documenting innovative startups that have had a disruptive impact on this space since 2013. Replete with poignant use cases and data-rich insights, it offers a fresh look at an economic landscape that\u2019s destined for an exponential growth spurt in coming years. \nWith the advent of Bitcoin in 2009 came its most obvious use case, namely, making the global transfer of money as simple as sending an email. The success of this has now informed the world of remittance, a billion-dollar market with profound implication for migrants and their families. \nAccording to a recent World Bank research report, the potential benefits are enormous for the 250 million global citizens that send $601 billion in remittances back home every year. But as the book \u201cReinventing Remittances With Bitcoin\u201d suggests, there is still much ground that needs to be explored in terms of blockchain technology\u2019s vast potential in this equation.\nThe book\u2019s author, Luis Buenaventura, is a Filipino entrepreneur who has been building internet startups for over 10 years. Based in Manila, he has specialized in digital currencies, with a specific focus on the bitcoin remittance space since 2014. Over the years, he has presented on related topics at a number of conferences, including Inside Bitcoins, BlockFin Asia, the International Money Transfer Conference and the Brookings Blum Roundtable. \nWith his current startup BloomSolutions, Buenaventura helps money transfer businesses improve their processes through Bitcoin and the blockchain. He says he initially discovered Bitcoin back in 2014 in an attempt to identify a solution to low credit card usage rates in the Philippines (around 5 percent at the time) \u2014 an issue that had made it challenging to build an e-commerce business. He says that while Bitcoin wasn\u2019t a great fit for ecommerce payments, it was a superior mechanism for cross-border value transfer. This, he says, is how he got started on the road of bitcoin remittances. \nHis new book is informed by remittance developments occurring in the Philippines, his home country. The number of Filipinos working abroad (the seventh largest among nationality groups of migrant workers around the world) registers at slightly more than 6 million (based on 2013 data). Remittances to families back in the Philippines were estimated at $29.79 billion, the third highest in the world. \nIn the opening chapter of the book, Buenaventura asserts that it\u2019s simply not possible for a small Bitcoin startup to singlehandedly overthrow Western Union, MoneyGram or other major remittance industry players at this stage. He does, however, suggest the possibility of delivering a very compelling alternative to a small subsection of their customers. \u201cNarrow your focus to the smallest possible problem you can solve, as the oft quoted startup saying goes,\u201d he notes in the book. \nHe admits that while Bitcoin has a ways to go as a currency, it is extremely good at instant settlement. The book cites Bitspark in Hong Kong and Align Commerce as examples of companies that are currently facilitating the acceptance of fiat currency and converting that cash into bitcoin on the back end prior to transferring the funds to off-ramps in countries like the Philippines and Indonesia.\nIn breaking down this process, he explains the First Mile and Last Mile challenges and solutions; the former reflecting the remittance transaction origination point, and the latter the end point destination for the settlement process. \nCase studies on companies like BitPesa, Bitspark and Abra are widely interspersed throughout the book, along with topical coverage of themes such as \u201cDoes the Bitcoin Price Matter?,\u201d \u201cBitcoin Regulation Around the World\u201d and \u201cAbra: The Uber of Remittances?\u201d among others. \nHe brings the book to a close with a section entitled \u201cWhy Doesn\u2019t Western Union Use Bitcoin?\u201d Here, Buenaventura states that Western Union doesn\u2019t need Bitcoin in its infancy stage, noting that the current unregulated status of digital currencies makes it a risky proposition for a publicly traded company. \n\u201cI felt like we\u2019ve gotten so caught up in how Bitcoin is performing as a speculative investment, that we've forgotten its usefulness in other regards,\u201d Buenaventura said to Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cThe community has largely moved on from the initial excitement in 2014 around using Bitcoin as a remittance vehicle, and I wanted this book to reaffirm that it\u2019s still happening, and it\u2019s actually working successfully. The fact that 20 percent of the personal remittances flowing between South Korea and the Philippines is now powered by Bitcoin is a big deal, and it deserves to be recognized.\u201d\n \nOn the ongoing crisis involving refugees and immigrants worldwide, particularly the terse climate between the U.S. and Mexico,and its potential effect on remittance markets, Buenaventura said:\n\u201cWhile my familiarity is limited to what I read on the feeds, I will say that any time you attempt to restrict cash flow between countries, people will get creative. Maybe that will bring more people into the Bitcoin fold, or maybe it will cause them to stuff cash envelopes into their shoes when they travel. Maybe it\u2019ll be a little of both.\u201d\nHe laments that there are a lot of components involved when building a bitcoin remittance corridor between countries, which he says is the reason you can\u2019t just throw up new corridors every other week. He cites as an example the difficulty in building a corridor between Malaysia and Nepal because there are no bitcoin exchanges that will allow you to convert your BTC into local currency on the receiving side. And he says that building such corridors in Papua New Guinea, Myanmar or dozens of other countries is even more challenging because the banking infrastructure isn\u2019t homogeneous and doesn\u2019t lend itself toward automation.\nNevertheless he remains optimistic about the potential of Bitcoin as a conduit for advancing the remittance movement worldwide. \u201cThe book is meant to act like a general guide for the whole business process. I\u2019m hoping that it will awaken entrepreneurs in these disparate locales to try to solve these problems in their own backyards, and then hook up to the global bitcoin remittance network when they\u2019re ready. The only way to get the whole world connected is if you have hundreds of startups all working on their own piece of the puzzle, because the challenges are deep and varied. Call it the decentralized remittance revolution.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 7}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIt appears that the Venezuelan authorities have had enough of Bitcoin. Over the past two weeks, police in the Latin American country arrested eight Bitcoin miners in three different cities. While some of them were accused of cybercrime and stealing energy, others were merely selling ASIC hardware. In addition to that, the country\u2019s main exchange \u2014 Surbitcoin \u2014 had to halt operations, as the company\u2019s bank closed their account.\nWhile the country\u2019s economy is in a state of turmoil, and the national currency \u2014 the bolivar \u2014 has been in hyperinflationary free fall for some time, the socialist regime in the Latin American country subsidizes electricity to the point where it\u2019s almost free. As covered in a popular article published on reason.com last November, this has made Bitcoin mining popular among some tech-savvy Venezuelans. Even yields from older, secondhand hardware can provide a lifeline to order food products and medicines from outside of the country. \nThere is no official law against Bitcoin mining in Venezuela, and using the digital currency is legal too: travel agency Destinia even decided to ditch the bolivar and exclusively accept bitcoin. Regardless, as the country has been plagued by scarce electricity and regular blackouts, it appears that (ab)using the cheap energy for the purpose of Bitcoin mining does not go down well with local authorities.\nIn what was the biggest bust of the past couple weeks, the Polic\u00eda Nacional Bolivariana (PNB) raided a warehouse in Valencia, the third-largest city in Venezuela. As reported by reason.com, the building hosted 11,000 ASIC miners, which allegedly consumed enough energy for an entire village. The arrested duo has been accused of stealing electricity, but also of cybercrime, financing terrorism and exchange fraud.\nIn a separate case that same week, four people operating over 300 ASIC machines were arrested by agents from the Cuerpo de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, Penales y Criminal\u00edsticas (CICPC) in the relatively small town of Charallave. Somewhat similarly, these four suspects were charged with electricity theft and internet fraud, Spanish-language Bitcoin news site CriptoNoticias reported. According to the director of the CICPC, the miners had affected \u201cthe consumption and the stability\u201d of electricity service in Charallave, reported reason.com.\nAnd, perhaps the most notable case, the PNB also arrested two men from Caracas. As opposed to the other suspects, these men were not themselves mining Bitcoin. Rather, they attempted to sell mining equipment through MercadoLibre, an online marketplace. It is currently not clear what these men were arrested for exactly.\nAnd to top it off, Venezuela\u2019s biggest bitcoin exchange, Surbitcoin, had to halt operations as well. According to Surbitcoin, the exchange received a notice from their bank Banesco on February 2 that their bank account would be closed the next day. The exchange says it is establishing a new commercial structure to prevent situations like this one in the future, and in the meantime recommends customers use LocalBitcoins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, trading volume on LocalBitcoins broke records last week, with 1.12 billion bolivars\u2019 (approximately $337,000) worth of bitcoin exchanged.\nWhile it seems that Venezuelan authorities have increased the pressure these past two weeks, it is not the first time Bitcoin miners were arrested in the country. About a year ago, a Bitcoin miner was arrested and jailed for three months on charges of electricity theft. Unsurprisingly, most Venezuelan miners therefore keep their operations relatively small and hidden from authorities.", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 7}

The current 15 members of B3i include Achmea, Aegon, Ageas, Allianz, Generali, Hannover Re, Liberty Mutual, Munich Re, RGA, SCOR, Swiss Re, Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance, Tokio Marine Holdings, XL Catlin and Zurich Insurance Group.\n\u201cWe are excited to join this new initiative and look forward to playing an active part in it,\u201d said Steve Hales, head of Connected Insurance at Generali Group. \u201cIt represents another milestone that confirms our commitment to creating value for our customers by embracing new technology which in turn can be used to mitigate risk and improve efficiency. The blockchain initiative is particularly important in insurance where the secure and efficient exchange of information can benefit from disruptive technology that could eventually lead to game-changing applications.\u201d\nGenerali, a multinational group with a global presence founded in Italy in 1831, is the largest insurer in Italy and one of the largest in the world.\n\u201cWe believe that B3i is a key initiative in the insurance ecosystem that could further modernize our industry and pave the way to unexplored opportunities,\u201d added Paolo Ribotta, head of Global Corporate & Commercial at Generali Group. \u201cWe have invested in the transformation of our corporate and commercial business, especially in multinational programs, where the digitalization is crucial to ensure the highest level of service to our international customers. Our customers in all industries are exploring and investing in distributed ledgers and smart contract technology to achieve end to end synergies, integration and efficiency. We want to continue to speak their language, helping them to drive their business adding value beyond the policy in a simpler and smarter way.\u201d\nB3i will explore ways to leverage distributed ledger technologies to streamline the exchange of data between reinsurance and insurance companies, starting with a proof-of-concept pilot project about transacting reinsurance contracts amongst each other. \u201cIf blockchain technology proves to be a viable tool, it could transform the insurance industry through a shared, transparent record of contract-related information,\u201d Generali said in a statement.\nMajor life and health reinsurance firm Reinsurance Group of America (RGA) also announced that it has joined B3i. Reinsurance indicates the practice, common in the insurance industry, to swap insurance contracts as a means of risk management and tax mitigation. RGA, one of the largest global life and health reinsurance companies, is the only global reinsurance company to focus primarily on life- and health-related reinsurance solutions. Founded in 1973, the company now numbers among the leading global providers of life and health reinsurance and financial solutions.\nThe forthcoming blockchain technology project of RGA will be channeled through RGAx, a wholly owned subsidiary of RGA established in 2015 as an \u201cinnovation accelerator\u201d for the life insurance industry.\n\u201cBlockchain technology has the potential to link insurance entities in a powerful data-sharing framework, and the B3i consortium and pilot project can demonstrate and accelerate this innovation,\u201d said RGAx VP Farron Blanc. \u201cAt RGA, we are always excited to partner with those who are trying to achieve similar goals of efficiently deploying capital and knowledge to provide financial protection to society at large.\u201d\nBlack told Bitcoin Magazine: \u201cEssentially B3i is a consortium of some of the world\u2019s largest insurers and reinsurers who realize the collective value and importance that distributed ledger technology can play in terms of business to business contracts, such as a primary insurer-to-reinsurer treaty.\u201d\n\u201cThe minimum viable product will focus on natural catastrophe contracts. Successful applications [of blockchain technology] in the reinsurance sector will involve streamlining the process between all the intermediaries (brokers, insurers, reinsurers), and could dramatically improve the ability of all of the various functions that touch these large treaties (e.g., technical accounting, claims, underwriting, IT, finance and valuation),\u201d explained Blanc.\nThe potential killer apps of blockchain technology in the insurance sector at large are, according to Blanc, more difficult to predict. \u201cWe\u2019ve been sponsors of a few public blockchain hackathons; and a lot of the cases that get demoed involve distributed marketplaces for regular consumers to transfer/protect their risk,\u201d concluded Blanc. \u201cI\u2019m less bullish on those types of applications, because of the various asymmetric incentives and information problems that can crop up. I am excited about what blockchains could do with respect to upgrading the invisible infrastructure (e.g., the millions of data sources that are called every time someone submits a claim, or applies for new coverage).\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 2, "day": 8}

The company is currently in talks with clients in Switzerland, two cantons and a national government body, as well as two other countries for potential pilot programs, Daniel Gasteiger, founder of Procivis, told Bitcoin Magazine.\n \nA former UBS banker, Gasteiger is the co-founder of nexussquared, a Zurich-based fintech platform focusing on blockchain technology that provides business coaching services and consulting, and operates an acceleration program called nexuslab.\n \nHis latest venture, Procivis, is focusing on applying blockchain technology to the public sector and governance.\n \nThe company is developing a blockchain-powered platform designed to run a government-curated \u201capp store\u201d offering the full range of public administrative services, including tax filings, land registry and commercial registry. Procivis is working closely with Estonian e-government experts to develop its \u201ce-government as a service\u201d solution. \nKaspar Korjus, the managing director of Estonia\u2019s e-Residency program, is one of Procivis\u2019s strategic advisers. \n\u201cLearning about the level of digitization of the public sector in Estonia left me deeply impressed, especially when looking at the state of digitization in Western Europe, including Switzerland,\u201d said Gasteiger. \u201cBy bringing Estonia\u2019s leading e-government experts on board and adding our blockchain experience, our aim is to create a platform that can serve as the future electronic backbone of democracies across the globe.\u201d\n \nAfter regaining independence in 1991, Estonia embarked on a period of modernization that established the foundation needed to bring the country into the digital age.\n \nEstonia\u2019s use of modern information and communication technologies in the public sector has placed the country at the forefront of states that are seeking to modernize their public sector and provide transparent governance.\n \nThe e-Estonia movement, which focuses on facilitating citizen interactions with the state through the use of electronic solutions, nurtured the development of several e-services and programs, including i-Voting, e-Tax Board, e-Business, e-Banking, e-School and most notably e-Residency, a program that offers electronic residency to people from outside the country.\n \nSwitzerland and Beyond\n \nProcivis will be targeted at the Swiss market primarily but will also seek to serve other markets as well. More specifically, Gasteiger noted that the platform could help countries that are falling behind in their e-government effort to leapfrog their counterparts.\n \n\u201cGiven Switzerland\u2019s relatively poor position in international e-governance rankings, and of course the fact that Switzerland is our home base, we are naturally targeting Switzerland as a whole, along with its 26 sovereign states (cantons) for our e-government platform,\u201d said Gasteiger. \u201cBut we also strongly believe that we can have a powerful impact in countries with slightly less advanced e-government services (few or no \u2018legacy\u2019 systems) or in \u2018younger\u2019 democracies, more keen to invest in e-governance \u20182.0\u2019 and thus bypassing the \u2018trial and error phase\u2019 of other countries\u2019 implementation programs for such services, along with the obsolete technologies that come with it.\u201d\n \nHe added: \u201cWe are very much looking to work with such countries to help them deliver e-services to their citizens based on secure digital identities similar to what India has been doing with their Adhaar program, for instance.\u201d\n \nProcivis is now looking to raise 1 million CHF ($1 million) in seed capital to secure key managerial positions, finance research and development, and fuel growth in foreign markets.

This is a joint initiative of Europol, the law enforcement agency of the European Union; Interpol, an intergovernmental organization facilitating international police cooperation; and the Basel Institute on Governance, an independent not-for-profit competence center specializing in financial crime.\nAccording to the Basel Institute on Governance, the conference \u201caimed to provide law enforcement agencies and the private sector with the tools and understanding necessary to detect, counter and investigate criminal uses of virtual currencies.\u201d\nAs a concrete result, attendees agreed on a list of shared recommendations.\nCracking Down on Bitcoin\nSeveral of the recommendations specifically refer to Bitcoin and digital currencies, while others concern money laundering in general. If the recommendations are followed, they would significantly increase regulation of the digital currency space worldwide and make anonymous use of the digital currency much more difficult.\nPerhaps most importantly, the recommendations suggest that bitcoin exchanges and wallet providers should be regulated in much the same way as the financial sector. While the digital currency space is still not officially regulated in many countries, background and identity checks through Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation could become mandatory for anyone who wants to buy, sell or store bitcoin.\nAdditionally, bitcoin mixing services \u2014 which exchange bitcoins for different bitcoins to break the path to any particular piece of currency \u2014 are subject to several recommendations.\n\u201cAll countries are advised to take action against Digital Currencies Mixers/Tumblers,\u201d per a release from the Basel Institute on Governance. \u201cSuch services are designed exclusively to anonymize transactions and to make it impossible for Law Enforcement Agencies to detect and trace suspicious transactions. The existence of such companies should not continue to be tolerated.\u201d\nThe recommendations also suggest that law enforcement agencies should cooperate across borders in identifying \u201csuspicious Bitcoin addresses that threaten economic stability\u201d and even that \u201cunexplained wealth\u201d should be considered a crime.\nConnection to Cybercrime\nThe Working Group on Virtual Currencies was established in September of last year, in response to the popularity of digital currencies like bitcoin for illegal purposes.\nIn a 2015 report, Europol wrote that bitcoin was becoming the \u201ccommon currency\u201d for cybercriminals, accounting for over 40 percent of all identified criminal-to-criminal payments.\n\u201cBitcoin is no longer used preferentially within Darknet marketplaces but is increasingly being adopted for other types of cybercrime as well,\u201d the agency noted.\nExamples include cryptoware like CryptoLocker and Curve-Tor-Bitcoin (malware that locks computers and demands a ransom to unlock it), DDoS extortion, commercial distribution of child abuse, credit card fraud and more.\nSee the full list of recommendations from the Working Group on Virtual Currencies here.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 26}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIn the quest for a reliable proof of stake algorithm, IOHK CEO and Ethereum Classic developer Charles Hoskinson believes his company has made a breakthrough.\nCharles Hoskinson was one of the original founders and the initial CEO of Ethereum, but left the project before Ethereum's official launch in 2015. Along with another Ethereum veteran, Jeremy Wood, Hoskinson went on to Input/Output, or IOHK, a research and development company dedicated to cryptographic research and the architecture of digital currencies. \nSince Ethereum Classic split from Ethereum, Hoskinson became involved with the former. He recently announced \u201cthe Grothendieck Team,\u201d a new development team dedicated to the digital currency and smart platform project.\nMeanwhile, IOHK, collaborating closely with university academics, has been working on a proof of stake algorithm dubbed \u201cOuroboros.\u201d Whereas most digital currencies \u2014 including bitcoin \u2014 rely on proof of work by miners to reach consensus over the state of the ledger, proof of stake systems reach a consensus voted on by coin holders.\nProof of stake has been considered and experimented on for several years now, as some believe it may be superior to proof of work.\n\u201cThe obvious benefit of proof of stake over proof of work is that it doesn\u2019t require miners to burn energy, which makes it much more efficient,\u201d Hoskinson told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBut there are more advantages to it. It also allows for next-generation governance systems, for example, allowing stakeholders to indicate their preference on hard or soft forks.\u201d\nOuroboros\nOuroboros was developed by professors Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russel and Roman Olynykov, as well as Bernardo David.\nIn Ouroboros, new blocks are produced by randomly selected coin holders, based on a probability proportional to their stake. This is realized through a sort of lottery, which places the coin holders in dedicated timeslots that indicate their turn to produce a new block to update the blockchain. If a coin holder does not produce a block within their designated timeslot, their turn is simply skipped.\nThe main challenge of any proof of stake system is know as the \u201cnothing at stake problem.\u201d If the blockchain forks to two or more competing chains, the optimal strategy for any coin holder is to extend every fork. That way, it gets its block reward no matter which fork wins or multiple block rewards if several chains continue to exist. \nBut this is also at odds with a central design goal of blockchains: the incentive for everyone to converge onto a single chain.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Kiayias said this is to a large extent solved by a novel solution to achieve randomness for the lotteries. This should make the probability of stakeholders successfully forking the chain negligible.\n\u201cImagine that you have an initial \u00a0population of stakeholders,\u201d Kiayias said, explaining how this randomness is achieved. \u201cShortly prior to the system initialization, an initial lottery is conducted to choose a committee. All of this information becomes part of the genesis block and the protocol starts. The initial committee is responsible for advancing the blockchain the first time around and running a secure multiparty computation protocol that realizes a publicly observable \u2018beacon.\u2019 It\u2019s this beacon that generates the randomness for the lottery.\u201d\nOnce this lottery has selected an initial round of winners, and the blockchain is in motion, this process is repeated. This is called a new \u201cepoch.\u201d\n\u201cAt the end of the first epoch, the seed for the second epoch is computed and a new \u2018genesis\u2019 information is calculated,\u201d Kiayias said. \u201cThis includes the multi-party computation protocol computed seed, and a stakeholder distribution reflecting stake shifts from the initial stakeholder set. The protocol continues in the same fashion moving from epoch to epoch.\u201d\nWhile noting that Ouroboros is provably secure \u2014 a mathematical method of proving a protocol works as intended \u2014 Hoskinson did add that this does not mean all challenges pertaining proof of stake are completely solved. \nScaling Ouroboros to a global user base will require additional research and engineering, he said, while it's also not always possible to drop out of the consensus process to securely rejoin later.\nEthereum Classic\nEthereum has always planned to switch to proof of stake at some point in the future, using a yet-to-be-finalized protocol dubbed \u201cCasper.\u201d\nAlthough the initial plan for Ethereum Classic was to copy Ethereum in every step of the development process, it soon became clear that many in the community preferred for the project to take on its own path. The preferred consensus algorithm, whether it be proof of stake or proof of work, has always been a central topic in that debate.\nFor now, it seems the Ethereum Classic community is generally in favor of proof of work, and will most likely stick to that proven and tested consensus algorithm for the foreseeable future. The project recently even hard forked to diffuse the so-called \u201cdifficulty bomb,\u201d which ensured sticking to a proof of work consensus algorithm remains an option.\nDespite Hoskinson\u2019s involvement with Ethereum Classic, it seems unlikely the project will adopt IOHK\u2019s Ouroboros.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s fine. We shouldn\u2019t fall in love with one idea,\u201d Hoskinson said. \u201cWhile I do think Ethereum Classic\u2019s consensus algorithm, \u2018Ghost,\u2019 needs to be removed or improved, sticking to proof of work will help us differentiate from Ethereum, so the two projects can complement each other instead of competing. This could also help Ethereum, as miners will have a place to go when they make the switch, which should make their transition easier.\u201d\nFor more information on Ouroboros, visit the IOHK website and white paper and its GitHub page.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 25}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIf the split between\u00a0Ethereum and\u00a0Ethereum Classic wasn\u2019t definitive before, it is now.\nEthereum Classic, the project born out of\u00a0rejection of Ethereum\u2019s reversal of\u00a0The DAO, hard forked today. With that, Ethereum Classic has implemented the biggest protocol change yet, and\u00a0further differentiated itself from the Ethereum project.\nMost importantly, the hard fork \u2014 dubbed \u201cDie Hard\u201d \u2014 diffused the difficulty bomb, which was set to freeze the protocol later this year. Additionally, Ethereum Classic implemented replay protection, to ensure Ethereum transactions are no longer valid on the Ethereum Classic chain and vice versa. It also adjusted technical parameters to increase the cost of certain spam attacks.\n\u201cThis protocol upgrade demonstrated growing maturity of Ethereum Classic, as it's starting to blaze its own path not only in terms of ideology, but also technical choices,\u201d Ethereum Classic\u2019s project coordinator, \u201cArvicco\u201d told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cSuch as a commitment to staying on proof-of-work consensus for a prolonged period.\u201d\nThe Difficulty Bomb\nThe original Ethereum protocol, as implemented by the\u00a0Ethereum Foundation, included a so-called \u201cdifficulty bomb.\u201d Baked into the software, Ethereum\u2019s mining difficulty is programmed to increase exponentially over time. This has been unnoticeable up till now, but by around April or May of this year, it is set to increase so rapidly that mining will necessarily become unprofitable. As a result, no more blocks will be found at all, and the protocol will effectively freeze, creating an \u201cIce Age.\u201d\nThe Ethereum Foundation implemented this difficulty bomb to force its own hand \u2014 and that of the broader Ethereum community. As outlined in its\u00a0release documents, the Ethereum Foundation planned to roll out the Ethereum project in several stages, each one requiring a hard fork. The difficulty bomb was implemented to ensure that developers and the community would have to switch to a new protocol this year; eventually working toward a proof-of-stake mining algorithm known as \u201cCasper.\u201d\nAs a continuation of the original Ethereum protocol, Ethereum Classic also included that difficulty bomb. The Ethereum Classic community, however, has decided it will not follow the Ethereum Foundation road map, most notably regarding Casper. As such, there is little need for Ethereum Classic to keep the difficulty bomb, and it was removed with the Die Hard hard fork.\nThis gives the project more time to work on further protocol development, Arvicco said.\n\u201cNow that the most critical technical issues such as difficulty bomb and replay protection are resolved, ETC dev team will start focusing more on longer-term changes, such as monetary policy and improved platform stability and security.\u201d\nThe Split\nWith every hard fork, there exists a risk of not everyone switching to the new protocol, in effect creating two different networks and currencies. This is how the Ethereum Classic project itself started, of course, and could happen again.\nSo far, however, Die Hard seems to have gone through with few holdouts. While it is too early to tell with full certainty whether the ecosystem has fully switched to the new protocol, there didn\u2019t appear to be much opposition beforehand. A vast majority of hash power has also made the switch \u2014 though at time of writing a small number of miners hadn\u2019t yet.\n\u201cEven though we campaigned for two weeks for everyone to upgrade, about 0.5 percent of hash power kept mining on the old chain for a while,\u201d Arvicco said. \u201cThat was to be expected, though; with our last fork in October that was about 3 to 5 percent. So, there is \u00a0progress.\u201d\nAnd the odds of these holdouts bootstrapping their own currency seems unlikely, Arvicco believes.\n\u201cNot unless there is a community ready to support it both in terms of participation and real money. And the prospects of such community is not good with the bomb blowing up pretty soon.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 13}

For example, you choose to trade bitcoin using a 10:1 margin and decide to put down an initial margin of $100 for the trade. That means with your $100 you are gaining exposure to $1,000 worth of bitcoins. Hence, if the price increases by 5 percent, you will generate a return of $50 instead of only $5 if you had put on the trade without leverage. \nFor this reason, margin trading is very popular with traders who want to capitalize on bitcoin\u2019s short-term price increases. However, when you are trading using margins and the trade moves against you, you can also lose more than you initially invested. For this reason, regulators consider margin trading to be very risky for investors, especially in an already volatile asset class such as bitcoin. \nMargin Trading Continues But With Limitations\nMargin trading across the three exchanges has since been reactivated but with limitations on the amount of leverage that users are able to trade with. \nBitcoin exchange Huobi has reactivated margin trading but has limited the amount traders can borrow to 100,000 CNY (around $14,450), down from 10 million CNY ($1.45 million) previously. OKCoin, on the other hand, has limited its margin trading offering to 3x margin for bitcoin and 20x margin for bitcoin futures on its international version, only for non-Chinese residents. Its on-shore exchange has stopped offering margin trading. BTCC, on the other hand, has not reinstated its margin trading offering. \u00a0\nReduced Margin Trading Should Lead to Lower Price Volatility\nWhile it is unclear whether exchanges were ordered by the PBOC to reduce margin trading or whether it was a move to appease the Chinese central bank, the initial reaction to this announcement was negative for the price of bitcoin, dipping below the $800 mark to the mid $700s on Friday. \nHowever, the reality is that reduced margin trading at the three largest bitcoin exchanges in the world could actually turn out to be very bitcoin-positive, as reduced margin trading will likely reduce bitcoin volatility. \nMargin trading increases price volatility, especially to the downside, because when margin traders make losses during smaller movements, they tend to panic sell so that their losses are not exacerbated. This, in turn, fuels downward price movements further. A reduction in margin trading activities would, therefore, calm bitcoin volatility, which should be seen as bitcoin-positive in the long run both from an investment point of view, as it makes the asset less risky, and also for bitcoin as a transactional currency.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 16}

At this event, Don will become the first author to digitally authenticate and sign copies of a book: his new bestseller \u201cBlockchain Revolution.\u201d \nThe World Economic Forum has adopted the Fourth Industrial Revolution as its theme, based on a book by the same title authored by Klaus Schwab, WEF\u2019s founder and executive chairman. \u00a0\n\u201cThe First Revolution was steam where we mechanized things like shovels; the Second was electricity which enabled an economy of mass production; the Third was the computer which led to information technology and the internet and social media,\u201d said Tapscott in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, just hours before his flight to Davos.\n\u201cAccording to author Klaus Schwab, the foundational technology for the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the blockchain, insofar as it is a distributed ledger system now needed to manage wealth, value and prosperity creation in the world.

Unlike the internet\u2019s robust governance ecosystem with dozens of organizations and networks involved in ensuring that there are standards, advocacy, and knowledge, the blockchain Internet of Value proposition currently lacks these. I fear if we don\u2019t get our act together quickly in this area, some very bad things could go wrong and, worst-case scenario, it could implode.\u201d \u00a0\nPost-Davos, Tapscott says that he and his son Alex are in the early stages of curating a multimillion-dollar research program known as Blockchain Research Institute dedicated to furthering the depth and breadth of knowledge around the developing blockchain ecosystem.

Given that the price of bitcoin has been known to drop by 25 percent in a matter of days on the back of negative headlines, such as potential regulatory changes in China or the hacking of bitcoin exchanges, it is unlikely the SEC will consider a Bitcoin ETF a smart investment for retail investors.\n \nFurthermore, the fact that China is the largest market for the digital currency will not be looked upon favorably by the SEC. Reportedly over 90 percent of bitcoin trading activities occur on Chinese shores, which means they are taking place on exchanges that have a regulatory framework different from those in the U.S. Moreover, the SEC will be very wary of approving a new financial product whose price is indirectly controlled by China,\u00a0as we were able to witness at the beginning of January. Then, the price of bitcoin collapsed after the Yuan strengthened and the People\u2019s Bank of China issued a warning about the riskiness of investing in the digital currency, followed by on-site inspections on China\u2019s three largest exchanges.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 25}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nWhen a random person on the street in the United States is asked about bitcoin, he or she will usually respond that it is some sort of internet currency used to buy drugs online \u2014 if they\u2019ve heard of it at all. While bitcoin is far from anonymous and private in its current form, the desire for enhanced privacy features is not just about buying drugs from AlphaBay.\nIn a recent presentation at the Coinbase headquarters in San Francisco, California, Monero developer Riccardo \u201cFluffyPony\u201d Spagni described a variety of situations where financial privacy is desirable outside of breaking the law. \u201cThe thing that a lot of people misunderstand when we\u2019re talking about privacy is that it\u2019s not just about buying drugs,\u201d noted Spagni at the beginning of his presentation.\nFinancial Privacy Problems for Businesses and Individuals\nAlthough many individuals don\u2019t care about their online privacy at all \u2014 even in a post-Snowden era \u2014 Spagni was able to point out a few issues people will face when not protecting their financial privacy online.\nThe first item on Spagni\u2019s list, targeted advertising based on spending habits, may not be seen as a negative by everyone. After all, if someone is going to have advertisements thrown in their face on a daily basis, it would make sense for those advertisements to be related to their likes or interests. Of course, the downside here is that multiple other parties get to know about the individual\u2019s spending habits, which some would prefer to be left private.\nIn addition to drugs, Spagni pointed out that there are also perfectly legal purchases that users may wish to keep private. Pornography is an obvious example here.\nFor the wealthy, financial privacy is even more important. If someone is able to see an individual\u2019s entire balance when transacting with them, then it\u2019s much easier to know whether that individual may be a worthy target for theft or worse.\nIn addition to being targeted by others, low levels of financial privacy can also cause individuals to be unwittingly complicit in criminal acts. \u201cThis is something that could happen, for example, if you\u2019re using a tumbler and you end up with dirty coins,\u201d explained Spagni during his talk. \u201cAnd [the] next minute you deposit them into Coinbase and Coinbase closes your account.\u201d\nSpagni then sarcastically claimed that this is something that surely never happens with Coinbase accounts.\nFinancial privacy is also of the utmost importance for any business that wants to maintain a competitive advantage over their rivals. A lack of privacy in business transactions can lead to everything from revealing sensitive business relationships to leaking information related to salaries, profit margins and revenues.\nDevelopers of various blockchains have been somewhat surprised at the sorts of people who have been demanding privacy improvements for these systems. For example, Zcash CEO Zooko Wilcox-O\u2019Hearn has noted the financial industry\u2019s assistance in helping blockchains become more private.\nTransaction Censorship by Miners\nOne final point made by Spagni during this portion of his presentation is that a lack of financial privacy on a blockchain can lead to censorship by miners, who are the ones who decide which transactions get confirmed into each block. If a group of miners decided they did not want to process transactions signed by a specific Bitcoin address, then such a policy could be implemented today.\nOf course, the effect of such a policy would be that the targeted Bitcoin address would have their transactions delayed rather than stopped. This is due to the fact that each mining pool decides which transactions to include in the next block. The censorship of specific types of transactions would require a majority of miners to effect a 51-percent attack on the network.\nSuch an action could lead to a change in the proof-of-work algorithm used by the network, which means any ASIC hardware devices would be rendered useless.\nWith better privacy features, it becomes difficult for miners to target specific users or types of transactions because they are unable to distinguish one transaction from another.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 18}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nDutch public prosecutors and the tax inspection agency are ramping up their fight against bitcoin money laundering this year.\nAccording to research conducted by Dutch financial newspaper Het Financieel Dagblad (FD), at least three criminal cases pertaining to money laundering with bitcoin are scheduled for 2017. Additionally, the FIOD \u2014 the investigative arm of the Dutch tax authority \u2014 wants to lower the bar for prosecution of unlicensed bitcoin traders. The FIOD will also try to have mixing services recognized as money-laundering operations.\nThe Challenge of Anonymity\nBitcoin\u2019s relative anonymity (sometimes referred to as pseudonymity) and censorship resistance have made the digital currency a popular means of exchange on darknet markets like Alphabay and Silk Road. Europol believes that more than 40 percent of online transactions for illegal ends is done with bitcoin.\nDarknet market merchants typically do exchange their earned bitcoins for fiat currencies. While trading bitcoin for fiat is in and of itself not illegal, most exchanges apply strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) standards. This is usually requested from the financial institutions and banks that they work with. Darknet merchants, therefore, often prefer to exchange their bitcoins at what FD refers to as \u201cbitcoincashers\u201d: exchanges and dealers that do not comply with such rules.\nThe FIOD is now attempting to make prosecution of these bitcoincashers much easier. The tax authority wants the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to recognize illegal bitcoin trade as a type of money laundering. That would allow detectives to start an investigation without first needing to prove reasonable cause. A spokesperson for the FIOD told FD that it expects such recognition to be granted later this year.\nAdditionally, FD reports that the FIOD wants to have bitcoin mixers recognized as money laundering indicators as well, though it\u2019s unclear how far this regulation would reach. It would presumably apply to centralized mixers like bitmixer.io, which exchange bitcoins for different bitcoins to break the path to any particular piece of currency. But users of trustless mixing services, like\u00a0ValueShuffle or TumbleBit servers, may become a target, too.\nPending Cases Before the Courts\nAt least six bitcoincashers will appear before Dutch courts this year, divided over three different cases. The first of these are two men accused of drug dealing, money laundering and partaking in a criminal organization. Public prosecutors suspect these dealings involved about $2.6 million [\u20ac2.4 million] worth of proceeds from illegal activities. The second case concerns four individuals suspected of running an illegal bitcoin exchange that guaranteed anonymity to its users. The third case is part of a larger international investigation on money laundering. \nBitcoin Magazine reached out to The FIOD for further clarification but received no response at time of publication.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 20}

A sidechain can implement more powerful scripting features or more watertight privacy. Increased throughput is another key improvement over Bitcoin that can be implemented in a sidechain.\nIn 2015,\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine covered Blockstream\u2019s plans for the first commercial Bitcoin sidechain, code-named \u201cLiquid,\u201d able to provide instant transactions with a fast settlement layer for bitcoin exchanges, brokerages and other industry members. \u201cAs its main advantage, Liquid provides instant and secure transactions among all users of the sidechain,\u201d claims Blockstream. \u201cWhile Bitcoin transactions can typically take up to an hour to be sufficiently secured by the blockchain, Liquid offers a similar level of security within seconds.\u201d\nNow Blockstream has released another white paper, titled \u201cStrong Federations: An Interoperable Blockchain Solution to Centralized Third Party Risks.\u201d The new white paper introduces improvements over the federated peg mechanism mentioned in the first white paper. In particular, the consensus mechanism and trust model have been updated; mechanisms that allow settlement back to a parent chain in case of failure have also been introduced.\nIn essence, Strong Federations are cleverly constructed multisig addresses, where bitcoins are \u201clocked in.\u201d These bitcoins can be unlocked only if enough key holders agree the payment is valid. This setup can make for publicly verifiable, Byzantine-robust transaction networks that facilitate movement of any asset among disparate markets, without requiring centralized trust in any single party. It can also provide commercial privacy, with support for transactions where asset types and amounts are opaque while preserving the public verifiability inherent to Bitcoin.\nThe new white paper consolidates and expands the initial concept of Liquid, which is now presented as a first implementation of a Strong Federation. \u201cThe first working implementation of a Strong Federation is Liquid \u2014 a Bitcoin exchange and brokerage multi-signature sidechain that bypasses Bitcoin\u2019s inherent limitations while leveraging its security properties,\u201d note the authors. In Liquid, \u201cconsensus history is a blockchain where every block is signed by the majority of a deterministic, globally-distributed set of functionaries running on hardened platforms, a methodology that directly aligns incentives for the participants.\u201d\nAccording to Blockstream, Strong Federations will be useful in many general-purpose industries, especially those that need secure and private exchange of digital assets, without a single party that controls the custodianship, execution and settling of transactions. \n\u201cThis new construction establishes a security profile inherently superior to existing methods of rapid transfer and settlement among exchanges and brokerages, and is directly applicable to other problems within existing financial institutions,\u201d note Blockstream experts Johnny Dilley, Jonathan Wilkins and Marta Piekarska, co-authors of the white paper.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, contrary to the current trend toward sanitized, \u201cpermissioned\u201d non-Bitcoin blockchains that deliberately disown the libertarian attitude of early Bitcoin adopters, the Blockstream approach remains anchored to the public Bitcoin blockchain and informed by a commitment to privacy and liberty. \n\u201cOur efforts focus on developing systems that protect individual liberty through cryptographic mechanisms as the right to privacy is one of the essential components of a free society,\u201d the authors of the white paper state. \u201cLiquid and Strong Federations attempt to improve upon the privacy guarantees offered by Bitcoin, whose open-by-default model often results in users inadvertently leaking personally-identifying information.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 19}

MonetaGo, based in New York, provides tools for financial institutions to get started with intra- and interbank payments on private permissioned blockchains that are owned and operated by the participants, and interoperable with existing real-time payments and settlement systems and core banking systems.\nAccording to MonetaGo CEO Jesse Chenard, the project is the first ever, end-to-end test of blockchain technology using existing banking protocols, including regulators, banks, financial institutions and clearinghouses. \u201cMost bank experiments to date have been either with single institutions or with only a couple of parties to a transaction,\u201d said Chenard. \u201cAnd then again, those have been in closed sandbox environments that were deployed simply for testing purposes.\u201d \nChenard added that interoperability with existing banking systems, processes and settlement mechanisms is an important concern. He also emphasized that the deployment of blockchain-based fintech solutions needs robust standards in place, and that\u2019s why MonetaGo keenly participates in the Hyperledger Project led by the Linux Foundation. \nChenard noted that, while today\u2019s regulatory approach to blockchain technology is still \u201cunfriendly\u201d and driven by a perception of blockchain technology as an enabler of illegal activities, regulators should embrace the blockchain as a useful tool able to provide greater visibility and transparency in real time into the actual transaction records than was previously possible. \u201cThis innovation has the potential to bring about additional financial stability and market efficiency, which is why many regulators are taking a cautionary but optimistic approach,\u201d said Chenard.\nThe IDRBT published a white paper titled \u201cApplications of Blockchain Technology to Banking and Financial Sector in India,\u201d also included in a MonetaGo news release titled \u201cMonetaGo Successfully Demonstrates the Effectiveness of Blockchain Technology in Collaboration with Indian Banking Authorities and Major Banks.\u201d The white paper was developed with the participation of a working group that, besides RBI and MonetaGo, included the State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, Infosys, IBM Research, Deloitte and other partners.\nThe white paper includes a proposed roadmap for the gradual adoption of blockchain technology in the Indian banking and financial sector. The roadmap recommends that banks should run internal experiments and pilot projects first, and then move to interbank applications such as centralized KYC (Know Your Customer), cross-border payments, syndication of loans, trade finance, capital markets, supply chain finance, bill discounting, monitoring of consortium accounts and servicing of securities.\nThe central bank itself, following other central banks including those of Canada, England, Sweden and the Netherlands, should start exploring the idea of using blockchain technology to digitize the national currency, which would facilitate the transition to a cashless society. \u201cFrom a technological perspective, we feel that BCT [(blockchain technology)] has matured enough and there is sufficient awareness among the stakeholders which makes this an appropriate time for initiating suitable efforts towards digitizing the Indian Rupee through BCT,\u201d the white paper reports.\n\u201cIDRBT has taken the initiative of exploring the applicability of BCT to the Indian Banking and Financial Industry by conducting a workshop involving all the stakeholders such as the academicians, bankers, regulators and technology partners,\u201d said R.

The alliance will specifically address various regulatory conflicts and work with its 11 regional commodity exchanges to establish a nationwide standard for the implementation of distributed ledger technology (DLT).\nChinaLedger is focusing its resources on the development of a shared base platform. It aims to establish an ecosystem wherein businesses and industry leaders can build applications on top of a standard distributed ledger protocol modeled after the base platform of the alliance. Other consortiums such as R3CEV tend to focus on blockchain technology joint projects revolving around the interoperability of its members. \nThe ChinaLedger official white paper reads:\n\u201cChinaLedger is more of an alliance that aims to maintain a shared base platform with common features together while constructing their applications on respective implementations of the base platform. In this regard, ChinaLedger is an alliance with a resource sharing model.\u201d\nIn order to establish an industry standard protocol for the usage of distributed ledger technology, ChinaLedger will work with the Internet Securities Commission of the Securities Association of China (SAC), an industrial self-regulatory body supervised by the China Securities Regulatory Commission that also functions as an advisory to the alliance. These oversight bodies will help to ensure businesses and organizations can avoid running into conflict with existing regulatory frameworks on both financial and non-financial applications.\n\u201cSince the establishment of ChinaLeger, the alliance has gathered systematic discussions among the members regarding the legal and regulatory environment of the Chinese capital market, the functional requirements of typical business scenarios and the progress to promote the applications of DLT,\u201d the white paper reports.\nEmphasis on the Vast Applicability of Distributed Ledger Technology\nThroughout its white paper, ChinaLedger continues to place an emphasis on the vast applicability of distributed ledger technology. The alliance is actively looking into the development of distributed ledgers outside the traditional realm of finance.\nIt has identified three major categories wherein the base platform of ChinaLedger will be utilized: capital side, asset side and non-financial side.\nCapital side refers to the application of distributed ledger technology as a currency and as a method of transferring stores of value in a flexible and scalable network. An example of a capital-side application of blockchain technology is bitcoin, which is recognized as a global store of value and is used by individuals around the world.\nWhile distributed ledger and blockchain technologies are currently being explored by banks and financial institutions as means of payment, ChinaLedger outlines the applicability of DLT in several industries and markets that oversee trillions of dollars worth of assets and non-monetary properties. These include marketable securities, bulk assets, rights and interests, and credits of loyalty programs.\nThe alliance will focus on these four assets and properties with its shared base platform to maximize the potential of DLT to settle, store or process stocks, bonds, futures, funds, options, lands, commodities and other physical assets.\nInterestingly, within the base protocol of ChinaLedger, there exist two methods of data settlement that businesses or organizations can choose from. The first option is to manage funds and assets in different structures, managing funds off-chain and assets on-chain. In this ecosystem, funds are moved by a \u201cpayment gateway\u201d among its members.\nThe second option is to manage both funds and assets on-chain, allowing the transfer of funds and the settlement of assets simultaneously. This is beneficial to businesses or platforms that have to complete the trading of assets and processing of funds at the same time.\nApart from the application of DLT in asset trading and settlement of funds, ChinaLedger will actively investigate and develop unique DLT-based platforms and technologies that can be applicable to other industries in China. \nIn the beginning, ChinaLedger aims to engage itself in the capital market by introducing a \u201csettlement coin\u201d pegged to fiat currency. Over time, it hopes to detach itself from fiat and work independently, processing 100,000 transactions in one second and demonstrating a large daily volume of 80,000,000 data points or transactions.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 17}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nEmpty blocks have turned into a controversial topic in the Bitcoin community over the past few months. This renewed attention on the topic has been sparked by the number of nearly-empty blocks mined by Antpool recently.\nAn empty block is one that only contains a coinbase transaction. This may seem counterproductive, but there are incentives in place that make mining empty blocks a practical endeavor from the perspective of a miner.\nWhy Do Miners Mine Empty Blocks?\nAccording to Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo, there are three main reasons as to why empty blocks have been mined in the past.\nThe first issue had to do with a mining pool letting the network know that a new block had been found. This was especially problematic when a miner in China was trying to let nodes on the other side of the Great Firewall know about a newly mined block. Other nodes would essentially be notified of a new block\u2019s existence but would still need to download the entire block over a slow connection.\nBlock relay time between peers was also a problem in the past, but Corallo\u2019s FIBRE network has mostly negated this issue. FIBRE is a protocol used to relay blocks around a network of nodes with essentially no delay.\nLastly, it takes time for a miner to figure out which transactions are in a block and validate them. The process of validating the previous block\u2019s transactions and removing them from the mempool is the main culprit behind the majority of the empty blocks that are still being mined on the network.\nThe Decline of Empty Blocks\nIn 2015 and early 2016, empty blocks were quite common on the network. According to data from Bitfury, a total of 264 empty blocks were mined in November 2015. At an average of 1,994 transactions per block (the average transaction count in completely full blocks up to this point), that\u2019s the equivalent of over 525,000 transactions worth of unused block space. That is many more transactions than the entire network has processed on any single day of its existence.\n\nDecember 2016, the most recent month for which data is available, only 34 empty blocks were mined. So what happened?\nFor one, the issue of empty blocks was brought up at the inaugural Bitcoin Roundtable meeting between the Bitcoin mining community and a few Bitcoin Core contributors. \n\u201cEveryone was saying more capacity was needed, so that was something we could address in the very short term.\u201d BTCC COO Samson Mow told Bitcoin Magazine.\nAccording to Mow, BTCC\u2019s mining pool was able to reduce the number of empty blocks they produced through various architecture improvements involving bandwidth reduction and data broadcast improvements.\nAntpool has also made improvements to its own systems. \n\u201cWe developed a new block broadcast system,\u201d an Antpool representative told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cBlocks can be broadcast to the world in one to three seconds through this system, the recent system is the final testing, and now there will be some empty or small blocks, but after we finished the test, the probability of [an] empty block appears to be minimum, and we will open source system.\u201d\nIn the view of BTC.com\u2019s Kevin Pan, the decline of empty blocks has occurred in large part because of compact blocks, which is an improvement that was implemented in Bitcoin Core 0.13 and FIBRE.\nViaBTC\u2019s own improvements allowed it to become the largest mining pool that does SPV mining to not mine an empty block over the course of last month.\nBitFury, on the other hand, has never mined an empty block. \n\u201cBitfury started to use special techniques to avoid empty blocks because it is against the community,\u201d Bitfury CIO Alex Petrov told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe support more transaction processing, and the easiest way to do that is just avoiding empty blocks mining.\u201d\nPetrov says he has offered to help other mining pools avoid empty blocks since 2014, but many pools only became interested in avoiding empty blocks in late 2015 as Bitcoin had to deal with full blocks for the first time.\nBesides being the driving force behind FIBRE, Corallo implemented compact blocks in Bitcoin Core. In his view, a variety of different factors have led to the decline in empty blocks mined on the Bitcoin network. \u201cIt's a question of which things have improved block propagation where, and I think there are a lot of things,\u201d he told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cFIBRE has made a difference, certainly, but also individual pools optimizing their own stacks makes a big difference.\u201d\nEmpty Blocks Will Continue to Decline\nOf course, there are still more relay improvements on the way, so there is no reason to think the number of empty blocks mined on a monthly basis won\u2019t continue to decline in 2017.\n\u201cWe're making massive strides in relay in Bitcoin Core in 0.13 [and] 0.14, and were miners to upgrade to some of the last-minute improvements going into 0.14 and use FIBRE, we'd see [empty blocks] once a month purely because the time between when one pool finds a block and when the rest have validated it is so short,\u201d said Corallo.\nCorallo is currently working with others on a system similar to weak blocks that is point-to-point rather than across the whole network.\nFor some pools, it takes less than 500 milliseconds to validate a newly mined block. To this point, Corallo stated, \u201cI'm working on decreasing that 500 milliseconds for everyone so even those who do mine empty blocks only do them for shorter periods of time.\u201d\nOne final point worth mentioning is that the incentive to mine empty blocks declines as transaction fees take over the block reward as the main source of revenue for miners. A miner will only want to mine a block with transactions in it if the fees associated with those transactions are the source of revenue.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 23}

The network\u2019s total estimated hash rate has essentially doubled since the middle of October. A large chunk of this increase has taken place over the past month, where the hash rate has increased by more than 50 percent.\nThe network hash rate is the total amount of computing power pointed at the Bitcoin network.\nPools That Saw Their Share of Total Hashing Power Increase\nIt\u2019s difficult to know where exactly this new hashing power is being deployed, but it is possible to see the differences in mining pools\u2019 shares of the overall hash rate.\nWhen comparing the most recently completed difficulty period with a run of 2016 blocks from the middle of October, GBMiners is the pool that saw the largest amount of growth. GBMiners enjoyed an increase of 62 blocks compared to the total set of 2016 blocks from October. Recently, it was found that GBMiners is connected to a Ponzi scheme disguised as a bitcoin cloud mining operation in India.\nSince October, BTC.TOP has grown from nothing to roughly 3 percent of the network hash rate. Batpool also emerged during this period of time to grab a little over 1 percent of the network. Not much is known about either of these China-based pools, other than the fact that ltc1btc.com Founder and CEO Jiang Zhuo\u2019er is behind BTC.TOP and does not much care for Bitcoin Core\u2019s Segregated Witness improvement.\nBoth GBMiners and BTC.TOP signal support for Bitcoin Unlimited as opposed to Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Unlimited is software that intends to replace Bitcoin\u2019s 1 MB block size limit with the concept of emergent consensus. At this time, it is unclear if this new digital currency network would be a new version of Bitcoin or an altcoin.\nIn terms of pools signaling for Bitcoin Core\u2019s Segregated Witness improvement, Bitfury saw the largest amount of growth. The mining pool saw an increase of just under 3 percent between the middle of October and the most recently completed difficulty period.\nPools That Saw Their Share of Total Hashing Power Decrease\nIf the above mining pools are mining more blocks, then that means someone else must be mining fewer blocks.\nNo miner saw a bigger drop in their share of the network since October than BTCC. BTCC now mines about 35 percent less blocks than they did in October.\nNo other pool came close to BTCC in terms of a loss in their share of the network hash rate, but ViaBTC and Slush Pool also saw notable declines. These two pools are mining about 25 percent less than the number of blocks they were mining in October.\nThe two largest mining pools on the network, Antpool and F2Pool, mined roughly 5 percent fewer blocks when their numbers were combined.\nAlthough never the largest pools on the network, Bitcoin.com, GoGreenLight and Kano CKPool all saw sizable declines.\nHash Rate Continuing to Increase\nAlthough the last difficulty period saw a rather massive increase of 16.6 percent, it appears that hash rate is continuing to be added to the network. At 118 blocks into the current difficulty period, there has already been another estimated 15.25 percent increase in the network hash rate.\nJudging from the rapidly increasing hash rate, it appears multiple mining pools are receiving shipments of new hardware. While some predicted Bitcoin could crash and burn as a result of the halving event over the summer, the mining pools were correct in predicting a more positive outcome.\nAs Bitcoin\u2019s total hash rate increases, it becomes more difficult for a motivated adversary to pull off an effective attack on the network.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 23}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin Unlimited, one of the Bitcoin Core software forks introduced in late 2015, garnered much attention in recent months. The project gained hash power support from several new Bitcoin mining pools, including ViaBTC, GBMiners and BTC.TOP, while node adoption appears to be on the rise as well.\nThe central idea behind Bitcoin Unlimited \u2014 specified in \u201cBitcoin Unlimited Improvement Proposal 001\u201d (BUIP001) \u2014 is to hand control of Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit to users and miners. Or perhaps more accurately: to make this control more explicit and easier to handle.\nHere\u2019s how.\nThe Proposal\nThe Bitcoin protocol, as enforced by economically relevant nodes, currently includes a one-megabyte block size limit. If a miner were to create a block larger than one megabyte, that block would be considered invalid. It would not become part of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, and the miner that mined it would have wasted its resources producing it.\nBUIP001 \u2014 drafted by Bitcoin Unlimited lead developer Andrew Stone \u2014 disposes of the one-megabyte block size limit protocol rule entirely, and replaces it with three configurable options. Two of these are configurable by all node operators, which include regular users as well as miners. And a third option is only for miners.\nThese configurations are signaled to the Bitcoin network. Regular users broadcast their preferences to other nodes, and miners embed their preferences in the blocks they mine.\nOption 1: Maximum Generation Size, or \u201cMG\u201d\nFirst, there is the Maximum Generation Size, also referred to as \u201cMG.\u201d This option is for miners only and is fairly straightforward: it lets miners set the size of blocks they produce. The default setting is one megabyte: It doesn\u2019t automatically diverge from the current Bitcoin protocol. But if a miner wants to create a two-megabyte block, it\u2019s as simple as \u201cflipping a switch\u201d in Bitcoin Unlimited\u2019s user interface. If a miner wants to produce an eight-megabyte block, it\u2019s the same switch.\n(The only limits left are limits on message length, which Bitcoin Unlimited set at 160 megabytes. And eventually data type limits or machine resource limits.)\nMG gives miners full control over the size of blocks they produce. But of course, as explained above, a two-megabyte block would be rejected by the network right now.\nThat\u2019s where the second configurable option comes in.\nOption 2: Excessive Block Size, or \u201cEB\u201d\nThe Excessive Block Size, typically referred to as \u201cEB,\u201d determines the size of blocks that nodes and miners accept. If a miner produces a two-megabyte block, that block will be accepted by all nodes and miners that set EB to at least two megabytes.\nEB is set at sixteen megabytes by default and is configurable by both normal users and miners. But it is an especially important configuration for miners: miners only mine on top of blocks they accept. A miner that maintains Bitcoin\u2019s current one-megabyte block size limit will reject a two-megabyte block, to instead keep mining on the last one-megabyte block. A miner that sets EB to two megabytes, however, will immediately mine on top of that same two-megabyte block, regardless of what the rest of the network does.\nOf course, this also presents a problem.\nIf a minority of miners sets EB to one megabyte, and a majority of miners sets EB to, say, two megabytes, the network could split in two. As soon as anyone mines a two-megabyte block, a minority of miners will ignore it, and instead continue to extend the one-megabyte chain. The majority of miners, however, will accept the chain with the two-megabyte block, and extend that chain.\nDifferent groups of miners would consider different chains valid, and mine on top of their \u201cown\u201d chain while ignoring the other chain. This split could technically last forever without the two chains ever converging, in effect splitting Bitcoin into two different networks and currencies. \nIn an attempt to resolve this, Bitcoin Unlimited introduces the third configurable option.\nOption 3: Excessive Acceptance Depth, or \u201cAD\u201d\nExcessive Acceptance Depth, or \u201cAD,\u201d essentially overrules EB. More specifically, AD determines the number of added confirmations a block requires, before nodes and miners accept it regardless of that block\u2019s size. The default is four.\nSo, let\u2019s say a node sets EB to two megabytes, and AD to four added confirmations. If that node receives a three-megabyte block, it will initially ignore that block since it exceeds its two-megabyte EB. But if a majority of miners does not ignore that block, and mines four new blocks on top of it, the node\u2019s two-megabyte EB is overruled by its four AD confirmations. The three-megabyte block is retroactively accepted as valid.\nAs such, different miners (and nodes) should \u2014 eventually \u2014 converge on a single valid chain, even if they have different MG and EB settings.\nLast, it\u2019s worth briefly mentioning the \u201csticky gate.\u201d If a node\u2019s AD is hit, that node will accept subsequent blocks of any size for about 24 hours (144 blocks). This sticky gate ensures that miners immediately build on the chain with the newly accepted bigger blocks, and not continuously lag behind on the rest of the network, while waiting for each block to reach sufficient AD.\nThe next article will take a closer look at some of the weaknesses of BUIP001.\n\u201cJonny1000\u201d contributed to this article.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 25}

In 2016, the top five largest Bitcoin and blockchain rounds accounted for $264 million in funding, representing over 60 percent of all funding to companies in the space over the period. These include Digital Asset Holdings\u2019 $67 million funding round, Circle Internet Financial\u2019s $60 million Series C and Blockstream\u2019s $55 million Series A.\n \n\u201cIt's time to challenge if these investments actually improve the ecosystem and generate real value to banks, corporates and market participants overall,\u201d said Naushad.\n \nBased in Edison, New Jersey, PayCommerce is a cross-border payments network that leverages distributed ledger technology to provide instant cross-border transactions in the business-to-business payments space. In the last 12 months, the company has processed $400 million worth of transactions and cleared 250 million transactions on the network. It leads a banking consortium counting more than 100 members in 83 countries.\n \n\u201cWe are planning to grow our network 20 percent year-over-year,\u201d Naushad said, adding that his company plans to expand in growth markets including the United Arab Emirates and Asia-Pacific.\n \n\u201cWe are trying to become the premier global heterogeneous network \u2014 a portfolio of banks can connect to PayCommerce\u2019s network and fully leverage the full capabilities of our products and services.\u201d\n \nWhile there has been a lot of discussion around how distributed ledger technology is disrupting capital markets, little has been said of its use in facilitating cross-border payments. \n \nCross-border payments represent 20 percent of total transaction volumes in the payments industry worldwide, according to the 2015 McKinsey Global Payments Map. In 2014, cross-border payment flows totaled $160 trillion, generating over $300 billion in revenue from services provided to payers and payees.\n \n\u201cIt would be nice to see a payment-focused consortium come together,\u201d said Naushad. \u201cIt is the year of cross-border instant payments. We hope that those with a solid, trusted, proven network will lead the way forward. It\u2019s the year where the hype around blockchain [technology] in 2016 must be put to use.\u201d\n \nIn this age of digital innovation, banks are paying a lot of attention to new, emerging technologies that promise greater efficiency, especially distributed ledger solutions.\n \nBlockchain technology, a buzzword in the financial services industry, promises to revolutionize the way firms manage and share data, and has the potential to reduce banks\u2019 infrastructure costs by 30 percent, according to Accenture.\n \nBlockchain solutions connect banks directly across the world, allowing them to bypass existing infrastructure while providing alternative sources of settlement.

Specifically, FinCEN determined that Western Union failed to (1) implement and maintain effective AML compliance oversight of certain agents and sub-agents; and, (2) failed to file suspicious activity reports (SARs) in a timely manner.\nThere are several takeaways from the experience of this legacy organization for money transfers that their counterparts in the Bitcoin space would be wise to note. In an exclusive interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Joe Ciccolo, Founder of the U.S.-based BitAML, agreed to explore the findings and offer his thoughts on the potential implications for Bitcoin money transmitters. BitAML provides regulatory compliance solutions for digital currency startups. \nFor starters, Ciccolo who has an extensive background in bank regulatory compliance, said that FinCEN made the determination that Western Union failed to adequately perform due diligence on several of its agents and sub-agents, thereby preventing the monitoring of these agents and any subsequent corrective actions. \nDue diligence, he says, is a vital component of onboarding company agents. Routine background checks, the collection of agent information, and onsite visits are instrumental to the vetting process. In addition to the obvious AML compliance benefits, these actions, he notes, are just good business practices. \nSays Ciccolo: \u201cMoney transmitters should strive to build and maintain a strong class of agents to properly and ethically represent their brand. This is especially true for Bitcoin money transmitters whose relatively small size \u2014 coupled with larger, more rapid growth potential \u2014 may increase the likelihood of overlooking prudent and proper agent due diligence. AML programs, policies and procedures should ideally be designed to scale along with the money transmitter, whether legacy or Bitcoin.\u201d \n\u00a0Ciccolo also noted that as a principal money transmitter, Western Union is responsible for understanding and appropriately accounting for the risks associated with its agents. He asserted that this should be of no surprise to anyone in the industry. In fact, FinCEN just recently reminded principal money transmitters of their responsibilities when it reiterated existing agent monitoring compliance obligations in March 2016.\nReturning to the settlement agreement, FinCEN went on to state that the failure to perform adequate due diligence prevented Western Union from ensuring agents were compliant with recordkeeping and reporting requirements. What\u2019s more, FinCEN determined that Western Union failed to take sufficient corrective action when it suspected certain agents were involved in fraud and money laundering activities.\nSays Ciccolo: \u201cThe cumulative impact of ineffective agent monitoring policies and procedures is clear. Bitcoin money transmitters with principal-agent arrangements are advised to establish and constantly review and update, as necessary, comprehensive agent onboarding and monitoring policies and procedures.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSecondly, according to Ciccolo, FinCEN determined that Western Union failed to develop and implement policies and procedures that could detect and lead to the reporting of suspicious activity.\n\u201cWhile Bitcoin money transmitters are familiar with their obligation to report suspicious or unusual customer activity to FinCEN via Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR), many may be unaware that this obligation extends to \u201cinsiders,\u201d such as employees or agents.\u201d \nFinCEN, says Ciccolo, found that Western Union rarely filed SARs on agents found to be complicit in business practices of concern. Further, in many cases, Western Union took over 90 days to file a SAR, well-north of the statutory requirement of 30 days. \u201cIt\u2019s important that Bitcoin money transmitters establish policies and procedures for thoroughly completing SARs, and filing them in a timely manner.\u201d \nFinCEN Deputy Director Jamal El-Hindi remarked that the settlement agreement reflects \u201crecognition of past shortcomings and the damage that can be done when there\u2019s a failure of a culture of compliance.\u201d \nMaking it clear that AML obligations and enforcement actions are not just for the large multinational financial services providers, El-Hindi concluded by remarking that \u201cmoney transmitters, large and small, play a critical role in the movement of legitimate funds around that world, and they also are of vital assistance to FinCEN and law enforcement in thwarting illicit activity.\u201d\nIn a press release, Western Union was quick to note that the settlement was mainly related to activity occurring prior to 2012, and that the company has since increased compliance funding by 200 percent over the last five years. \n\u201cWhile this is admirable and suggests a commitment to reform,\u201d said Ciccolo, \u201cI\u2019m not sure the budgets of most Bitcoin money transmitters could afford such an increase, to say nothing of the monetary fine and the reputational risks of an enforcement action.\u201d \u00a0", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 24}

Near the end of their discussion, Antonopoulos made the point that Bitcoin is stronger than ever and all of the drama in the community needs to be ignored.\nThe Technology Is the Most Important Thing in Bitcoin\nThere has been plenty of Bitcoin-related drama on social media lately, especially when it comes to issues involving scalability (and the block size limit). Some Bitcoin enthusiasts now prefer the /r/BTC subreddit due to disagreements with the moderation policies of /r/Bitcoin. There is a stark contrast between the two subreddits when it comes to each group\u2019s vision for how Bitcoin should scale over the long-term.\nMany of the disagreements between the two sects of the Bitcoin community have turned ugly, and Antonopoulos believes it\u2019s best to get back to the technology\u2019s roots.\n\u201cI think the most important thing is to try to objectively look at what\u2019s really important in the Bitcoin space, which is the technology,\u201d said Antonopoulos. \u201cTry to not be discouraged by a lot of the extraneous drama that\u2019s going on. In my mind, a lot of the drama is distracting from the real progress that\u2019s being made.\u201d\nAntonopoulos went on to point out that, by many metrics, Bitcoin is stronger than ever. In his view, Bitcoin has never been as diverse or distributed as it is today. The \u201cMastering Bitcoin\u201d author is also impressed with the large amount of technological innovation that has taken place in the space.\nTo Antonopoulos\u2019s point on innovation, there are a few enhancements to Bitcoin that are on the horizon. To many, TumbleBit, lightning networks, Segregated Witness, Mimblewimble and RSK are some of the most exciting technological advancements the Bitcoin community has seen up to this point.\nBitcoin also recently achieved an all-time high for confirmed transactions in a single day on January 5, and despite the recent drop, the bitcoin price has nearly doubled since early 2016.\nSome of the Drama Is Manufactured to Be Divisive\nWith such a large amount of drama going on in the Bitcoin community, Antonopoulos is convinced that at least some of it is coming from nefarious actors. \u201cAll too often people can get caught up in the drama, and I do believe that a certain percentage of that drama is manufactured to be divisive [and] distracting,\u201d he said.\nAntonopoulos went on to note that every grassroots movement and disruptive organization in history has had infiltrators and provocateurs who are paid to cause turmoil. \u201cIt would be naive to assume that Bitcoin is the first one where that isn\u2019t happening,\u201d he added.\nWhile there is a lot of infighting among the core Bitcoin community, it\u2019s unclear if most users are even aware of it. Many end users may be more concerned with whether or not the technology works. \u201cThere are billions of people that are still unbanked, and they don\u2019t care about the petty squabbles of who insulted who and called the other person the wrong name,\u201d said Antonopoulos.\nAntonopoulos\u2019s advice to the Bitcoin community was simply to keep innovating on the technology if they want to see it succeed over the long-term.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 13}

Amid burgeoning interest in new frontiers of Bitcoin and blockchain innovation, this year\u2019s conference promises to offer new insights into the future trajectory of these technologies.\nThe conference features a series of educational offerings and exhibits highlighting emerging ideas and trends in the field. Guest speakers at this year\u2019s event include Intellisys CTO and Bitcoin evangelist Charlie Shrem, Veritaseum founder Reggie Middleton, Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik, OpenBazaar founder Brian Hoffman, Breadwallet CEO Aaron Voisine, Bitfury founder Valery Vavilov and many more. Exhibitors include the likes of Unsung, Genesis Mining and the Blockchain Education Network.\nOn the eve of this year\u2019s conference, we had a chance to talk with conference organizer Moe Levin about the history of TNABC, hot topics of interest and his biggest hopes for the 2017 event. Here\u2019s what he had to say.\nThe Beginnings of TNABC\n\u201cTNABC began in 2012, drawing 100 delegates. In 2014, the event welcomed more than 2,000 visitors from 40 nations, while 2015 and 2016 boasted over 6,000 visitors from 120 nations. I attribute this growth to our efforts at meticulously selecting speakers who share with our attendees the strategies, technologies and innovations they\u2019ve developed and mastered.\n\u201cThe North American Bitcoin Conference was created to draw [the] community together \u2014 a group ranging from enthusiasts to financial institutions that provide an open and hard-hitting forum for moving the conversation forward. Having been a part of the Bitcoin universe for several years, I\u2019m truly excited about where these developments are going to take us in the coming years.\u201d\nAnticipated Topics of Interest \n\u201cThis conference intends to cut through the noise in order to focus on actionable innovations and technologies that attendees can apply right away. We want guests to discuss strategies they\u2019ve developed and mastered, and share them with others so that we can all apply and build upon them. With this in mind, we hope guests come ready to tackle complex concerns we face today, [and] leave armed with solutions that harness the power of blockchain technology.\n\u201cThe first [topic] is obviously the huge price increase and Chinese demand. This in itself will mean that the conference will be crowded and electric.\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s recent price surge has invigorated investors and entrepreneurs in the industry. Post-election, we\u2019ve seen bitcoin prices steadily rise and more and more people become interested in alternative currencies as not only a viable but potentially necessary investment. All of this, I\u2019m sure, will fuel some very interesting discussions around just what role bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will play in the future landscape of banking and fintech.\n\u201cThe second topic is the block-size debate, and how it will be resolved. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion in the past, and not a lot of movement. I\u2019m hoping this conference will be able to move the conversation further.\n\u201cRight now is a critical moment for Bitcoin as it is entering a crucial phase in its development and adoption. In the past few months it has seen a dramatic increase in visibility, experiencing both the good and bad sides of the limelight \u2014 like rising interest among corporations and investors, alongside more regulatory scrutiny, and uncertainty. More than ever before, we need the global community to help us ensure a prosperous and well-balanced future for the technology.\u201d\nTNABC and the Future of Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology\n\u201cBitcoin and Bitcoin technology is fast emerging as a key area of innovation, and is generating huge interest in the world today. In recent times, government entities and financial market regulatory bodies have come forward to express their keen desire to adopt this sophisticated technology to enhance the efficiency of their transactions. Not surprisingly, today the world is witnessing significant increase in digital transactions. While most easily identified with virtual currency, the software underlying bitcoin has demonstrated a range of business applications beyond finances, offering immense potential in several other areas for a variety of sectors and industries.\n\u201cThe North American Bitcoin Conference offers a unique opportunity to explore these trends and understand the impact of this technology in various areas as well as look at its regulatory aspects. We also offer a broad platform to work together on possibilities of developing new relationships to encourage further innovation in this technology.\n\u201cThose who are not well schooled in bitcoin and its underlying technology are not alone. Most executives in fact don\u2019t understand the repercussions of this new disruptive tech. The North American Bitcoin Conference [helps] to get up to speed on the applications, ramifications and nuances of Bitcoin and the blockchain, allowing one to profit from this new technology.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 13}

Monero is built on the core principles of privacy, decentralization, open development, scalability and fungibility.\u201d\nThe announcement comes shortly before Monero\u2019s scheduled hard fork, estimated for January 9 or 10. During a few hours after the fork, Monero users will not be able to make XMR deposits in exchanges.\nMonero v0.10.1 \u201cWolfram Warptangent\u201d is considered to be a vital upgrade to the Monero protocol, as it provides major RingCT performance improvements. The RingCT technology, an invention of the Monero development team, is an essential tool that allows Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell\u2019s Confidential Transactions to work with Monero\u2019s ring signatures. The correlation between the two technologies ultimately anonymizes user transactions, hiding amounts in Monero transactions.\nMonero\nMonero launched in 2014. As opposed to many altcoins, Monero is not based on Bitcoin\u2019s codebase but instead on the CryptoNote reference implementation, an altcoin that was itself designed from scratch.\nThe altcoin was created by the pseudonymous developer \u201cthankful for today,\u201d but he was quickly \u201cfired\u201d by the community, as the project was forked away from him. It has since been led by a core team of seven developers, including Riccardo \u201cfluffypony\u201d Spagni and Francisco \u201cArticMine\u201d Caba\u00f1as.\nAsked by Bitcoin Magazine  about Kraken\u2019s decision to add Monero, Spagni said:\n\"Monero wants to enable people to own and spend their wealth as privately as possible, and so the addition of more fiat gateways, like Kraken, will help users to get on board and use a cryptocurrency that does its utmost to defend their privacy. What is pretty cool is that companies like Kraken are enabling Monero without the need for an upfront payment, promises of volume or even much in the way of interaction from Monero contributors.\"\nA Positive Start to the New Year\nThe integration of XMR by Kraken and major improvements in RingCT mark a positive start to 2017 for Monero users and investors, following a year of advancements.\nThe privacy-focused currency also surpassed the value of Litecoin and Ripple for a brief period of time at\u00a0$230 million U.S. market cap, hinting at the rising demand for Monero.\nXMR is also one of the few digital currencies that has an actual user base in the darknet, in comparison to other digital assets and currencies in the market that haven\u2019t seen major commercial success or progress in their user base.\nMonero users can also expect to see more, improved ease-of-use as tools for Monero, including the GUI wallet the Monero team is working on. It is already available via Bitsquare and Shapeshift, and Jaxx will be adding Monero to its suite of wallets in the near future.\n\u201cWe're very excited to be adding support for XMR into Jaxx,\u201d said Jaxx CEO and founder Anthony Di Iorio. \u201cThe integration has been a challenge due to the unique nature of the Monero code; however, it\u2019s almost complete and Monero users will soon have the option to manage and send their XMR from multiple devices and platforms.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 3}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nNeedham & Company has put together a report on the prospects of the Winklevoss twins\u2019 proposed bitcoin ETF, and it comes with both positive and negative news for the digital bearer asset. Spencer Bogart, a research analyst at Needham & Company, put together the report in response to the questions the company had been receiving from their clients regarding a possible bitcoin ETF.\nAccording to the report, the positive effect that a bitcoin ETF would have on the price of bitcoin is vastly underappreciated, and the probability of approval is drastically overestimated within the industry.\nAn ETF\u2019s Effect on the Bitcoin Price\nNeedham\u2019s report describes two reasons as to why an ETF would have a profoundly positive impact on the bitcoin price.\nFor one, the report estimates the listing of a bitcoin ETF on the Bats exchange would see $300 million worth of assets flow into it within the first week, an estimate Needham claims to be conservative.\n\u201cWhile bitcoin liquidity has improved dramatically in recent years \u2014 and average daily trading volume now resembles that of the average security in the S&P midcap 400 \u2014 it would be hard for the ETF\u2019s authorized participants to acquire $300M worth of bitcoin without significantly pushing price up,\u201d notes the report.\nNeedham also believes the approval of a bitcoin ETF would change the overall perception of the regulatory risk surrounding the asset. \u201cIn terms of perception, the SEC approving a bitcoin ETF would add legitimacy to bitcoin in the eyes of investors \u2014 this alone is no small matter considering that many still associate bitcoin strictly with illicit activities,\u201d says the report.\nIn addition to the improved perception of bitcoin that comes with the SEC\u2019s stamp of approval, Needham also believes a mainstream investment vehicle for bitcoin would increase the percentage of bitcoin holders in the total population. In their view, this weakens the political appetite for enacting onerous regulation.\nThe report states a belief that the technical constraints of sourcing the bitcoin to meet the demands of an ETF and the improved perception of bitcoin would have roughly equal impacts on the price.\nBut What About the Prospects of Approval?\nAccording to their report, Needham puts the chances of a bitcoin ETF approval in 2017 at below 25 percent. The report states that this is in contrast to the beliefs held by many people whom Needham has spoken to in the Bitcoin industry.\n\u201cIn terms of incentives, the SEC is tasked with protecting consumers and, in this regard, we don\u2019t see much upside to approval for the individuals tasked with making this decision \u2014 even if the ETF is a huge success (we think it would be),\u201d the report explains. \u201cIn contrast, if a bitcoin ETF were approved and something went very wrong it would likely reflect poorly on the SEC.\u201d\nDue to the nascent nature of the technology as well as the fear, uncertainty and doubt surrounding it, Needham thinks approval of the bitcoin ETF will be too risky a proposition for individuals working at the SEC at this time.\nOne caveat to Needham\u2019s read on the situation is that the ETF will be approved if the SEC takes no action. In their view, this may be a more politically acceptable approach from the perspective of the individuals responsible for making this decision.\n\u201cThat said, we understand it is extremely rare for a proposed rule change to make it to this stage \u2014 typically either the Commission makes a decision prior to the deadline or the original sponsors of the rule change withdraw the request,\u201d the report adds.\nUpdated note: The research analyst and research associate who wrote the report covered in this article received compensation via Needham & Company's revenues,\u00a0including investment banking revenues for Bitcoin Investment Trust, which is a competitor to the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 12}

Of course other countries, notably including China, have similarly well-funded plans.\nA supercomputer is usually thought of as a big machine that fills a whole warehouse and consumes as much power as a small town. There is much truth in the perception of supercomputers as expensive toys that only major governments and global corporations can afford, but the emerging paradigm of distributed supercomputing could make ultrahigh-performance computing pervasive and affordable. The idea of pay-as-you-go, massively distributed cloud supercomputing, once a science-fictional trope (see for example Greg Egan\u2019s cult novel \u201cPermutation City\u201d), is gaining ground \u2014 and the blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin could have an important role to play.\nMassively distributed supercomputing is suitable for those demanding computing problems that are amenable to massive parallelization \u2014 splitting a large problem into many smaller tasks that can be farmed out to a distributed network. But there are ways to \u201cparallelize\u201d many computing tasks that, at a first glance, don\u2019t seem suitable for massively parallel computing.\nOne of the first successful examples of massively distributed supercomputing was SETI@home, a crowdsourced citizen science project started in 1999 to find candidate signals from alien intelligences. The SETI@home system sends millions of chunks of data (\u201cwork units\u201d) to the participants, to be analyzed by their home computers. The SETI@home software processes the data on the participants\u2019 computers in the idle times used by screensavers, and sends the analysis results back. Initially powered by custom software, SETI@home was later ported to the BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) platform, which powers other similar projects including the vLHC@home citizen science project for particle physics, managed by CERN.\nVolunteer citizen scientists contribute their own computing resources to BOINC projects for karma points and the satisfaction of contributing to important causes. But it seems likely that the new crowdsourced supercomputing paradigm can achieve critical mass only once viable ways to financially reward the participants are introduced.\nEnter blockchain technology. It\u2019s worth noting that Bitcoin provided a spectacular demonstration that the general masses will flock to the weirdest ideas proposed by scientists and social activists if they can make money in the process.\nTechCrunch ran a story on the potential of distributed ledger technology to usher in a new era of massively distributed computing with next-generation platforms that enable participants to lend and borrow computing resources \u2014 and make money in the process.\nThe story mentions several innovative blockchain companies, including Golem, a Polish company that is developing an \u201cAirbnb for computers\u201d able to \u201creduce costs and increase speed in domains such as scientific research, machine learning and graphics rendering, while making it possible for anyone with an average or better computer to share resources and make a side income,\u201d with an Ethereum-based transaction system to clear payments between buyers, providers and software developers. Golem\u2019s plans have found favor among investors, resulting in the third-largest platform ICO (Initial Coin Offering) ever, which raised $8.6 million in minutes.\nBesides processing payments to computing power providers, distributed ledgers can allocate work units based on criteria that include not only price, but also reputation, geographical location and special requirements that can be encapsulated in smart contracts.\n\u201cA distributed network of computers managed by blockchain and smart contracts can create a shared economy where anyone with a computer can borrow idle computing power and make a side income,\u201d notes TechCrunch columnist Ben Dickson. \u201cThe peer-to-peer nature of the blockchain and distributed ledgers will also help move computation closer to where the data is being generated, and avoid bottleneck round-trips to cloud servers.\u201d\nThe latter consideration seems especially important. \u201cThe biggest problem for computation overall is that the devices generating data are not located close-by to the data centers that perform the analytics,\u201d said David S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8, co-founder of IOTA, a distributed ledger for Internet of Things (IoT) applications.\n\u201cBecause the blockchain allows for a decentralized infrastructure, it can bring the data closer to their producers and consumers,\u201d added Gilles Fedak, co-founder of iEx.ec, a distributed cloud computing platform, \u201cwhereas with centralized cloud computing, data-centers tend to be located in remote areas.\u201d\nIn fact, while contributors of computing power are unlikely to make more than pocket change by offering their spare computing power, blockchain-based massively distributed cloud supercomputing could create interesting opportunities for operators based close to the data sources \u2014 for example, close to where IoT devices collect data for, say, environmental analysis \u2014 and able to make an initial investment.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 3}

We are already seeing all-time new highs in terms of market cap. All-time new highs in terms of price per bitcoin are likely just around the corner as well. Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come, and clearly the separation of money and state is happening right before our eyes. And with the former CEO of Barclays bank being appointed to the board of\u00a0Blockchain.info, I think 2017 will be the year we see traditional banks becoming deeply involved in Bitcoin, too.\u201d\nEric Lombrozo, Bitcoin Core Developer and Co-CEO of\u00a0Ciphrex\n\u201c2017 will continue to see further modularization and layering of network architectures. We will also see tremendous breakthroughs in privacy-enhancing crypto, practical demonstrations of trustless \u2014 or minimal trust \u2014 off-chain protocols with the promise of economically viable instant microtransactions, and general improvements to bootstrapping mechanisms for extending blockchain networks with less social friction.\u201d\nKathleen Breitman, CEO of\u00a0Tezos\n\u201cI think one of the most remarkable things about the space to date is how receptive regulators have been to learning about use cases for both private and public blockchains. With respect to public blockchains, I think we will see regulators continue their \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach, putting emphasis on financial control at the exchanges but keeping a light touch on the technology itself.\u201d\nAlejandro De La Torre, Business Development at\u00a0BTC.com\n\u201cIf the demonetization as we\u2019ve seen in countries like India and Venezuela continues, I expect to see a blossoming of Bitcoin interest. Another trend I see emerging is Bitcoin security. Many users are realizing that their bitcoins are not safe in exchanges and are switching to wallets that have beefier security or using cold storage.\u201d\nStephen Pair, Co-Founder, President and CEO of\u00a0BitPay\n\u201cI believe we'll see a renewed focus on the Bitcoin blockchain. We'll see a few new applications of the Bitcoin blockchain that do surprisingly simple, yet very powerful, things. People will begin to see Bitcoin in an entirely new light.\u201d\nAaron Voisine, Co-Founder and CEO of\u00a0Breadwallet\n\u201cI predict that 2017 will see bitcoin become recognized as a legitimate \u2018uncorrelated asset\u2019 for a large number of money managers and financial advisors. Holding a diversified portfolio of assets is of course what any prudent financial advisor will recommend. This however doesn\u2019t do you much good if those assets\u2019 value all move in the same direction at the same time. In order to achieve diversification, you need to hold some assets that increase in value when the others go down. Bitcoin is a perfect example of an asset that has shown to increase in value in times of fear and economic turmoil, and one that I think many money managers will begin to see as a prudent addition to their portfolios.\u201d\nAnthony Di Iorio, CEO and Founder of Decentral and Jaxx\n\"I'm predicting new well-led projects emerging that provide improvements and enhancements on Bitcoin and Ethereum infrastructures. Two projects I have my eye on in 2017 are Rootstock out of Argentina and Qtum out of China. I'm also quite optimistic about Zcash, Monero, and Dash.\"\nManfred Karrer, Developer and Founder of\u00a0Bitsquare\n\u201cI expect three things. One, regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges will come. Two, the war on cash, gold and cryptocurrencies will accelerate. And three, privacy-protecting technologies like Monero and Zcash will elevate in importance.\u201d\nSusanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, Founder of\u00a0BitNation\n\u201cI find smart contracts applied in the dispute-resolution realm most exciting, because it holds the promise to decentralize some of the most important parts of society: Governance, Law and Security. In an era when only 3% of Americans feel that they can always trust their elected officials, according to a Pew Research Centre report, this development is timely. Several initiatives are already emerging, including DAMN, Decentralized Court, Crowdjury and, of course, BitNation\u2019s Pangea platform.\u201d\nMax Kordek, CEO of\u00a0Lisk\n\u201cI believe that VCs will discover the value of cryptocurrencies or so-called \u2018App Coins,\u2019 and will begin to massively invest in this area of the industry. Secondly, projects like Lisk and Ethereum will be ready to let developers dive into blockchain development, which will become a \u2018trend\u2019 just as iOS development became a trend and a vast industry. Lastly, user experience will become a much more important focus point for blockchain projects. Their respective leaders will realize that creating elegant user experience is a necessity to gather mainstream adoption.\u201d\nTrace Mayer, Host of the\u00a0Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s network effects will get further entrenched during 2017. One trend I think we\u2019ll see will be in scalability via Segregated Witness, which will lay the foundation for millions of daily users. Also, many current and new use cases and financialization will appear with ETFs, which I believe will pave the way for massive amounts of investment capital to come into the industry.\u201d\nJoey Krug, Co-Founder of\u00a0Augur\n\u201cI think the biggest trend in 2017 will be the first wave of decentralized applications going live on Ethereum. Bitcoin allows us to send money around trustlessly, but Ethereum allows us to do things with the money trustlessly, like controlling when and when it cannot be sent programmatically, to a finer degree than Bitcoin\u2019s script allows for. This is a big deal because it means we\u2019ll finally start seeing some fun and practical consumer-focused applications of Blockchain tech. Think decentralized prediction markets, decentralized poker and more.\u201d\nAlex Tapscott, Co-Author of the Book\u00a0\u201cBlockchain Revolution\u201d\n\u201cOne, a major central bank will live test a digital fiat currency and it will work very well, leading to broader adoption. Additionally, large banks will begin shifting large amounts of OTC [over-the-counter] transactions to real-time settlement on private distributed ledgers. Look for JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Santander to lead the charge. And companies large and small and in every industry will begin developing a blockchain strategy, hiring key IT talent and launching pilots. I\u2019m talking insurers, healthcare providers, music labels, defense contractors, you name it. And finally, bitcoin will hit $2000!\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 3}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin, digital currency and blockchain technology experienced another explosive year in 2016. While bitcoin breached the all-time high in USD market cap, several new digital currencies claimed a place in the spotlights as well, while the blockchain buzz arguably peaked it all.\nOf course, Bitcoin Magazine kept up with all of it. Looking back on 2016, we compiled three top 6 lists, with our best-read topics in technology, business and news.\nThese were 2016\u2019s six top news stories, by popularity.\n6. IRS Orders Coinbase to Hand Over Customer Data\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) took the Bitcoin community by surprise late November.\nThe US tax agency\u00a0ordered major exchange and defacto wallet service Coinbase to hand over customer data for all users that bought bitcoin between 2013 and 2015. An extraordinary request, as the targets of the investigation are not specified, but instead referred to as a group of \u201cJohn Does\u201d. The request may also be a sign that the IRS is taking a more pro-active stance toward digital currency users and businesses in the U.S.\nShortly after the request was issued, Coinbase denounced the IRS' move, announcing it plans to challenge the order in court. About two weeks ago, a Los Angeles attorney also asked a federal judge to halt the IRS probe. And only yesterday, the IRS asked the court to dismiss the motions.\nIndeed, the story is still developing; but it already secured a #6 spot in our top news stories for 2016.\n5: The Rise and Fall of The DAO\nThe DAO made\u00a0headlines in 2016. As a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), The DAO was a code-based investment company built on top of Ethereum, in which shareholders were the decision makers of the project. By May of this year, The DAO had collected more than\u00a0$150 million worth of ether, shattering previous crowdfunding records.\nAnd then it got gutted.\nDue to a\u00a0bug in the code (or as the perpetrator\u00a0may argue: a feature), someone was able to withdraw millions of dollars worth of ether from The DAO in June. Even before the \u201ccompany\u201d had made any investment, the project was drained for about a third of all its funds.\nWhat followed was a cat-and-mouse game between the developers behind The DAO and Ethereum, and the hacker; an engaging saga for Bitcoin Magazine readers, securing a fifth spot in our top 6 news stories for 2016.\n4: Bitcoin Cloud Services Uncovered as Cloud Mining Ponzi Scheme\nWith an\u00a0exclusive story published in June, Bitcoin Magazine uncovered the supposed cloud mining service \u201cBitcoin Cloud Services\u201d (BCS) as what appeared to be a blunt Ponzi scheme.\nPictures as well as videos of the hardware facility turned out to be photoshopped, fooling and defrauding an estimated 4,300 customers. Rather than paying out profits from mining, the company most likely paid old users in money invested by newer users, while keeping some of it. Indeed, a straightforward scam.\nUnsurprisingly, BCS is no longer active; it seems its operators ran off with an estimated loot of up to 2,500 bitcoins, worth well over $500,000 at the time.\n3: Craig Wright\u2019s \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d Saga\nAnother year, another Satoshi Nakamoto.\nIn May, Australian computer scientist and businessman Craig Wright \u201crevealed himself\u201d to be the man behind the moniker of Satoshi Nakamoto, inventor of Bitcoin. Major media outlets including the BBC and the Economist reported on the news, while the claim was also backed by several prominent figures in the Bitcoin community. Most notably former Bitcoin Core lead developer Gavin Andresen \u2014 but also New Liberty Dollar issuer\u00a0Joseph VaughnPerling and others.\nWhen it came to providing cryptographic proof of his claimed second identity, however, Wright\u00a0failed. While Wright did publish a signature made with a private key only Satoshi Nakamoto should control, it turned out to be a publicly available signature, found in Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.\nWright followed up with an odd apology, claiming he could not prove he was who he said he was. And while some still hold on to their belief that Wright really is the inventor of the pioneering digital currency, most have dismissed the possibility by now.\n2: The Halvening\nWhen Bitcoin first launched, miners earned 50 bitcoins for each block they mined. But this number is halved every four years, or more specifically: every 210,000 blocks. This ensures that Bitcoin\u2019s block reward eventually decreases to zero, limiting the total amount of bitcoins that will ever be in circulation to 21 million.\n2016 marked the year of the second block reward halving. Dubbed \u201cthe halvening,\u201d July 9 was the day that Bitcoin\u2019s block reward decreased from 25 new bitcoins to 12.5 \u2014 not counting fees. It represented a key moment in Bitcoin\u2019s history, reflected in the popularity of the topic on Bitcoin Magazine, and secured a second-place spot in our top 6 news stories for 2016.\n1: \u201cThe\u201d Ethereum Hard Fork and the Birth of Ethereum Classic\nThe rise and fall of The DAO was one of the biggest news stories of 2016. But its aftermath was even more significant.\nTo reimburse investors of The DAO, the Ethereum Foundation eventually opted to hard fork the Ethereum blockchain. It was a\u00a0controversial decision, as it questioned both the \u201ccode is law\u201d mantra and claims of \u201camorality\u201d long perpetuated by creators of The DAO as well as developers behind the Ethereum project itself. Furthermore, not all users agreed with the hard fork. While polls and other data suggested that a majority within the Ethereum community supported the radical solution, a sizable minority\u00a0did not.\nSome of these users objected to the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s decision so strongly, that they\u00a0refused to make the switch to the new version of Ethereum when the hard fork happened in July, and continued to use the \u201coriginal\u201d Ethereum blockchain. As a consequence, the Ethereum\u2019s network and currency split in two. Rather than one Ethereum, there were multiple: \u201cEthereum\u201d and \u201cEthereum Classic.\u201d\nBoth Ethereum and Ethereum Classic continue to chug along to this day. And while the combined market cap of the two has fallen sharply since Ethereum\u2019s heights, both digital currencies claim a top-ten spot by market cap.\nAnd, a number-one spot in our top 6 news stories for 2016.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 3}

While only compatible with Bitcoin\u2019s testnet so far, the software is relatively feature-complete and operational.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now looking for the wider community to test the software,\u201d Joseph Poon, Lightning Labs developer and co-author of the lightning network\u00a0white paper, told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cTo get it ready for widespread use, but also to explore new use cases this enables.\u201d\nThe Lightning Network\nThe lightning network is a highly anticipated second-layer protocol to be rolled out on top of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. Cleverly utilizing Bitcoin\u2019s programmable elements (like multisignature and time-locks), lightning users should be able to make a virtually unlimited number of off-chain transactions with instant confirmations and at low cost. This should boost Bitcoin\u2019s micropayment-ability, overall scalability and even\u00a0privacy.\nThe release of LND v0.1-alpha, written in the\u00a0Go programming language, signifies that development of the protocol is on track. The implementation developed by Lightning Labs, but also BitFury and others, can open and close channels with counterparties to transact, route payments over the network, forward transactions from other users and more.\n\u201cThings are progressing very well,\u201d Poon acknowledged. \u201cWe now mainly need to finalize the specification, work on cross-compatibility with other implementations and improve various components like payment receipts and multi-hop payments. Additionally, we\u2019ll focus on optimizing performance over the next couple of months.\u201d\nThat said, the lightning daemon is not very user-friendly yet, as it\u2019s mostly intended for developers and experimentation. It doesn\u2019t include a user interface \u2014 though that will soon change, the team noted \u2014 and is so far only compatible with Bitcoin\u2019s testnet.\nLightning Labs will also publish a walk-through post soon, and open a channel faucet for anyone to get their hands on some testnet coins in lightning channels.\nTimeframe\nThe big question, of course, is when everyday users will be able to send and receive lightning transactions on Bitcoin\u2019s main net.\nEarlier estimates suggested that the lightning network could be operational\u00a0this winter, which from a technical perspective doesn\u2019t seem far off now. Different lightning teams met in Milan after the Scaling Bitcoin workshops in October of 2016, where they agreed on shared specifications now known as \u201cBOLT.\u201d \u00a0At least two other companies, Blockchain (Thunder) and Blockstream (Lightningd), have released early iterations of lightning software as well, while ACINQ, Amiko Pay and MIT\u2019s DCI are also working on implementations.\nWith the exception of Thunder, most lightning software cannot yet be used on Bitcoin\u2019s main net, however, as it is built with Segregated Witness in mind. The soft fork protocol change proposed by the\u00a0Bitcoin Core development team requires 95 percent hash power support from miners to activate \u2014 but has so far remained stagnant around\u00a025 or 30 percent.\nWhile Segregated Witness is not strictly necessary for the lightning network to work, Lightning Labs pointed out it would significantly benefit the protocol.\n\u201cIt would allow users to outsource channel monitoring, which means they won\u2019t have to constantly keep an eye on the Bitcoin blockchain. Meanwhile channels could be kept open longer and closed quicker. It would offer a better user experience overall,\u201d Lightning Labs developer Laolu Osuntokun said.\nLightning Labs Co-Founder Elizabeth Stark added: \u201cOne of the reasons why we wanted to put our software release and blog out there is to show how much better all of this could work with Segregated Witness activated.\u201d\nIf the Segregated Witness soft fork does activate, the LND alpha software could immediately be tested on Bitcoin\u2019s main net. Though for security reasons, as the team pointed out, preferably only with tiny amounts at first.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 13}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nIn the quest for privacy and fungibility in Bitcoin, two researchers (from Saarland University in Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany and Indiana\u2019s Purdue University) presented a promising privacy enhancement proposal last week.\u00a0ValueShuffle, as the protocol is called, describes a method to mix bitcoins and at the same time hide the amounts involved in the mixing process.\nIt\u2019s a potent combination, as Tim Ruffing, one of the researchers, explained:\n\u201cThe combination of these two privacy-enhancing technologies, while not requiring any trusted third party, is what makes ValueShuffle unique.\u201d\nCoinJoin and CoinShuffle\nRuffing wrote the ValueShuffle draft white paper with Pedro Moreno-Sanchez; these are the same two researchers who previously proposed the\u00a0CoinShuffle protocols, along with their PhD advisor, Aniket Kate, then at Saarland University.\nLeveraging\u00a0CoinJoin, first proposed by\u00a0Bitcoin Core and\u00a0Blockstream developer, Gregory Maxwell, CoinShuffle is a method to merge several transactions into one, with no need for a trusted party. As such, a single Bitcoin transaction can send bitcoins from many people to many people. This potentially obfuscates the trail of coins, as it\u2019s no longer clear exactly who paid whom.\nThe obfuscation is only potential, however, because the amount of coins involved in a transaction can be a giveaway. If one transaction sends five bitcoins from address to address, and another transaction sends seven bitcoins from address to address, merging these into one transaction would not obfuscate much. Simply matching the amounts reveals who sent bitcoins to whom.\n\u201cWith our initial CoinShuffle proposals, this can be solved if everyone uses the same amounts,\u201d Ruffing explained. \u201cIf everyone involved in the mix sends exactly one bitcoin, the sending and receiving addresses can no longer be matched. But this is also quite a limiting factor. Any remaining coins must go to some change address without being anonymized, which is cumbersome, and may even break privacy if not used properly. And for technical reasons it also means you cannot use CoinShuffle to make a payment directly; you can only send bitcoins back to yourself.\u201d\nConfidential Transactions\nWith ValueShuffle, the problem of matching amounts is solved by hiding the amounts involved in a transaction.\nThis is accomplished using another proposal designed to increase privacy in Bitcoin:\u00a0Confidential Transactions. Developed by Blockstream, Confidential Transactions is currently implemented in Blockstream\u2019s\u00a0Elements Alpha sidechain, which is active on Bitcoin\u2019s testnet.\nUsing clever cryptography, Confidential Transactions ensures that no one can see how many bitcoins are involved in a transaction, nor how many were sent from which address to which address. Nodes can, however, verify that the total number of bitcoins sent matches the total number of bitcoins received. As such, they can be sure no bitcoins were created out of thin air.\nThe combination of CoinJoin and Confidential Transactions has long been considered a powerful solution. As CoinJoin obfuscates which addresses sent bitcoins to which addresses, Confidential Transactions obfuscates the amounts, to break all links. With ValueShuffle, all this can be done without requiring a trusted party to merge the different transactions into one.\n\u201cPlus, it allows users to make payments directly through ValueShuffle, rather than having to send themselves mixed bitcoins first,\u201d Ruffing said.\nSegregated Witness\nThus far, however, the Confidential Transactions building block is not part of the Bitcoin protocol.\n\u201cBut it may be in the future,\u201d Ruffing said. \u201cIt can be rolled out with a backward compatible soft fork, which would be even easier if Segregated Witness is activated first. On top of that, ValueShuffle could benefit from Segregated Witness in other ways. Since Confidential Transactions are relatively expensive compared to normal transactions, the witness \u201cdiscount\u201d will help. And if Schnorr signature aggregation is deployed through Segregated Witness as well, that would be another boon for efficiency.\u201d\nIf Confidential Transactions does become part of the Bitcoin protocol \u2014 either through Segregated Witness or as an independent soft or hard fork \u2014 not much stands in the way of ValueShuffle. The solution would not require additional protocol changes; it would just require wallets to implement the solution. And, ideally, a server to host the mixing protocol.\n\u201cTechnically, it can be done without a central server, but it wouldn\u2019t be very practical. And keep in mind that a central server wouldn\u2019t need to be trusted with users\u2019 private keys or privacy, and they\u2019re easily replaced if something goes wrong.\u201d Ruffing said. \u201cAs for wallets, Mycelium has already implemented a version of CoinShuffle. And ValueShuffle is even easier to implement, because it\u2019s based on the simpler and more efficient CoinShuffle++ protocol.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 4}

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nBitcoin does not sleep, nor do its markets. Most exchanges run 24/7, day and night, even on weekends and holidays.\nThis is one reason some day traders \u2014 the people who trade on the price swings per hour or even per minute \u2014 use trading bots. These software programs can be plugged directly into exchanges, to apply trading strategies even when their operators are away from their computer, or busy doing something else.\nIndeed, if there is such a thing as \u201cmoney making machines,\u201d trading bots are it.\nOr are they?\nStrategies\nBots that are available on the market include Haasbot,\u00a0Tradewave and\u00a0Cryptotrader, the latter of which is cloud-based.\nEach of these trading bots react to market behavior on a specific exchange (or on several exchanges), and place buy and sell offers accordingly.\nThe offers they place are nothing out of the ordinary, and could be placed manually as well. However, by programming a sequence of orders, which is called \u201cpre-ordering,\u201d traders can apply a trading strategy without needing to monitor the markets continuously.\nStephan de Haas is Founder of\u00a0Haas Online and creator of Haasbot. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, he outlined a basic example of a pre-ordering strategy:\n\u201cLet\u2019s say I bought 10 bitcoins, and I want to sell them if the price reaches $1200. This can be done at exchanges already, of course. But using the bot, I can set it up to sell at $1200, buy back at $1000 and sell it all again at $1100. So I am building up a sequence of ordering events that must take place, and I define the exact target prices on it.\u201d\nDe Haas is a solid believer that these trading bots can make money consistently. By utilizing Technical Analysis (TA) tools provided by the bot, users should be able to gain an edge on other traders, especially those that don't use trading bots.\nAdditionally, bots typically offer \u201cinsurance\u201d options. Perhaps most importantly, these include \u201cstop loss\u201d orders that sell bitcoins if a predetermined low point is reached \u2014 for example, $950. This way, traders are sure they won\u2019t lose more than, say, five percent of their holdings, if the market crashes while they are away.\nMoney Making Machines? Not Guaranteed\nSome are more more skeptical about the value of trading bots, however.\nJacob Eliosoff runs a small digital currency investment firm whose strategies include algorithmic market making. Speaking to Bitcoin Magazine, Eliosoff agreed that bots can help traders \u2014 but noted that traders still make the decisions.\n\u201cIt can be handy to have a bot that adjusts your orders based on market conditions,\u201d said Eliosoff. \u201cHowever, where a bot would guarantee a return on investment, the traditional question is: Why are the creators of these bots selling it to you rather than running it themselves? If the bot doesn't decide which trades to do, but just helps you execute your own strategy better \u2014 fair enough. Keep in mind there are no free lunches.\u201d\nIndeed, these kinds of trading bots serve as a tool, not as solutions themselves. And whether these tools are useful also depends on the individual trader: Some full-time traders are profitable without using any bots at all.\nThe person known as \u201cKazonomics,\u201d who runs a trading group from his website\u00a0kazonomics.com, is not a fan of bots. Asked by Bitcoin Magazine, he did agree bots can be helpful for some people \u2014 but also doesn\u2019t believe any golden formula would guarantee an income.\n\u201cHaving the right formula to do what you want, and be profitable in the market is not the same thing,\u201d he noted. \u201cAnd TA in itself will not guarantee you profits either. There is no TA that would have, one year ago, called the correct low of oil, for example.\u201d\nInefficiencies\nAside from pre-ordering, bots can also be used to take advantage of market inefficiencies.\nTwo well-known strategies to benefit from market inefficiencies include arbitrage trading and market making. The former takes advantage of the price difference between different exchanges, for example to buy bitcoins for $1020 on Bitstamp and sell them for $1030 on Kraken. The latter places orders on otherwise low-volume exchanges, at slightly increased prices when compared to other exchanges, again to apply arbitrage.\nTypically, trading strategies benefit from market inefficiencies. Perhaps this is where trading bots can be particularly useful, Eliosoff noted. \u201cBots can do well if they allow for more efficient \u2014 cheaper or faster \u2014 execution of large orders, or electronic market making,\u201d he said.De Haas, too, thinks bots can take advantage of market inefficiencies.\u00a0\n\u201cThe flashcrash bot is one of our best bots,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cA flashcrash is when prices on an exchange change very rapidly, and the bot exploits this by buying up cheap coins and selling when the price returns to normal levels. This bot can do between 5 and 15 percent a day, on average. Exchanges love this bot, too: It makes their order books more liquid.\u201d\nKazonomics agreed that profiting from inefficiencies is probably the biggest advantage a trading bot can offer. \u201cModels built around arbitrage and other mean\u00a0reverting strategies, if done right, can work by exploiting market inefficiencies,\u201d he said. Though, noting: \u201cBut I don't know anyone with a working model who will sell it.\u201d\nThe problem with these strategies, Eliosoff\u00a0said, is that they are, frankly, too easy to apply. If anyone can make money by simply turning on a machine that benefits from inefficiencies, many will; as a result, the inefficiencies will disappear over time. A trader profiting from inefficiencies will either need to keep finding new inefficiencies, or simply compete with everyone else.\nThis is also why Eliosoff\u2019s trading fund primarily engages in algorithmic market making, a more complex strategy that smooths out large orders on a single exchange. \u201cI specifically avoided cross-exchange arbitrage because I see it as too easy and thus too prone to competition,\u201d he said.\nSo while Eliosoff believes profit can be made from inefficiencies, he concurred that it's not necessarily easy.\n\u201cSaying there are lots of ways to profit from arbitrage, market making and these types of strategies, is far from saying profits are guaranteed. Bots are like startups: obviously some succeed; also obviously, most don't. All in all, it's hard, and gets harder. The easier the strategy, the faster others are to jump in too,\u201d Eliosoff said.\nMagic\nA surefire strategy that will make you money forever seems unlikely, therefore. And while some will argue otherwise, it\u2019s virtually impossible to do so with a publicly available strategy. These will just be copied into oblivion.\n\u201cValue requires scarcity plus utility...so nothing of value is widely available,\u201d Kazonomics explained. \u201cThat includes trading bots. Once these are disbursed widely into the market, they become unprofitable pretty quickly.\u201d\nAnd as day traders are playing the markets \u2014 or perhaps more accurately, playing each other \u2014 only the best and most dedicated will have a shot at making money long-term. Even if bots are a useful tool for some, \u201cthe most dangerous fallacy about bots is the idea that there's some off-the-shelf magic gizmo you can buy that will produce a little stream of free money,\u201d Eliosoff said. \u201cTo make steady money, you need to build something yourself.\u201d\nDe Haas, however, remains optimistic his bot can help traders: \u201c100 percent sure.\u201d", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 4}

However, through Qtum\u2019s \u201cGo Mobile\u201d strategy, Qtum will push DAPPs to the masses.\nThe Qtum community has already launched two community projects: SpringEmail and Qloha. SpringEmail hopes to combine blockchain technology with the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), allowing users to use the mailbox to send and receive small amounts of digital currency.\nQloha, which utilizes WeChat\u2019s new \u201cmini programs\u201d platform, enables users to send Qtum tokens and chat with bots to order products or services via WeChat. Qloha hopes to extend this feature to other messaging platforms such as iMessage, Telegram and Facebook Messenger to improve the usability of blockchain technology.\nQtum plans to have a crowdsale to cover the development costs of the project on March 1, 2017, through their website and exchanges.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 11}

This two-year research agreement will allow IBM and the FDA to explore ways of exchanging patient-level data from a number of different sources, including electronic medical records, clinical trials and genomic tests, as well as information trails from mobile devices and wearables. This process is currently limited by concerns about data integrity, security and breaches that persist with the existing system.\nThe initial area of focus for this project will target oncology-related data, with IBM Watson Health and the FDA planning to share their initial findings later in 2017.\nThe key element fueling this push is the IBM Watson Health platform. Launched in April of 2015 as the first commercially available cognitive computing system delivered through the cloud, this system will play a key role in analyzing high volumes of data, sorting through complex questions and proposing evidence-based answers.\nDr. Shahram Ebadollahi, Vice President of Innovations and Chief Science Officer of IBM Watson Health's business unit, told Bitcoin Magazine that the FDA partnership will be aimed at leveraging blockchain technology using IBM\u2019s deep domain expertise in healthcare combined with efforts ensuing from its partnership with the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger project.\n\u201cWe plan to examine how this technology may offer a framework that could one day result in a secure patient/consumer exchange of health data for various purposes. Achieving this will require us to address a number of issues like privacy, interoperability and the issue of trust. That\u2019s no small task.\u201d\nThe ultimate intent of these efforts is to provide patients with a mechanism for securely sharing their health data for research purposes across the healthcare spectrum while creating opportunities for broader improvement to the existing, much-maligned healthcare delivery model. \u00a0\nIn a recent IBM Institute for Business Value paper \u201cHealthcare Rallies for Blockchain,\u201d the result of a survey of about 200 healthcare executives, more than seven in ten industry leaders believe that the highest return on investment for blockchain technology involves the management of clinical trial records, medical/health information and regulatory compliance.

It\u2019s here, he says, that the blockchain\u2019s distributed ledger capabilities can play an important role in facilitating the audit trail of information, thereby freeing it for greater utilization.\n\u201cThe underlying proposition we\u2019re seeking to address is how to place the health data in the hands of the consumer for use with their consent. Given the volume and variety of data we are dealing with here, we believe that blockchain [technology] can potentially make a meaningful impact without the need for a middleman or central clearinghouse.\u201d \u00a0\nIn terms of his long-term hope for this project, Ebadollahi said, \u201cAs growing numbers of potential applications become evident, IBM hopes to refine technological approaches toward building a scalable and decentralized infrastructure for more widespread use.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nDigital Currency Group (DCG) is perhaps the most important company in the Bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem when it comes to early-stage investments. DCG has made over 70 investments in the digital currency and blockchain space thus far, and those investments involve startups from 25 different countries around the world.\nAlthough DCG has invested in many companies building on top of Bitcoin, they\u2019ve found it difficult to find the right Ethereum companies to back so far. Having said that, DCG is now ready to announce their first investment in an Ethereum-related startup, Etherscan, which is an Ethereum block explorer.\nIn addition to their interest in the Ethereum blockchain, DCG has invested in RSK Labs, which is the team behind Rootstock (often referred to as an Ethereum-esque sidechain for Bitcoin). DCG Founder and CEO Barry Silbert is also notorious for making bullish tweets regarding ETC, which is the underlying token on the Ethereum Classic platform. Ethereum Classic is the original Ethereum blockchain that did not implement the hard-forking bailout of The DAO.\nBitcoin Magazine recently spoke with Barry Silbert to gain a deeper understanding of DCG\u2019s outlook on Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and Rootstock.\nDon\u2019t Decentralize for the Sake of Decentralization\nAt Consensus 2016, Silbert indicated that many of the projects building on Ethereum right now aren\u2019t all that practical. He noted that he was unsure of what problems would be solved by a decentralized, autonomous version of Uber.\nDuring his conversation with Bitcoin Magazine, Silbert indicated that his general view on Ethereum\u2019s decentralized applications has not changed. \u201cOur view is decentralizing a company or an idea for the fact of decentralization does not necessarily solve a real problem,\u201d said Silbert. \u201cAlthough, we haven\u2019t seen everything, so maybe there is a decentralized project out there with merit.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve essentially looked at every Ethereum company looking to raise capital in a traditional way, and we\u2019ve passed on all of them,\u201d added Silbert.\nOf course, that changed to a degree with DCG\u2019s investment in Etherscan. \u201cWe are excited to make our first Ethereum investment in Etherscan, alongside a great group of other industry investors,\u201d said Silbert. \u201cThe Ethereum blockchain contains a vast amount of rich data on native smart contracts, AppCoins and DAOs, but is difficult for a nontechnical user to navigate. We believe Etherscan will be a useful service for entrepreneurs and enterprises building on top of the Ethereum blockchain, and are eager to see more infrastructure developing around the budding Ethereum application ecosystem.\u201d\nDCG\u2019s Take on Ethereum Classic\nSilbert was one of the first well-known bitcoin investors to purchase and publicly support ETC once the token was made available for trade on Poloniex in the aftermath of the Ethereum hard fork that split the Ethereum network in two. The DCG CEO is so drawn to Ethereum Classic that he may be interested in building a publicly traded ETF for the alternative digital currency. Such a move would make sense for DCG as they\u2019re also behind the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which now has over $150 million worth of assets under management.\nIn the past, Silbert noted that Ethereum Classic needs to get rid of the difficulty bomb, make a decision on whether to stick with proof of work and finalize a long-term monetary policy before an Ethereum Classic investment fund could be considered. Finalizing a monetary policy is the only task left on that to-do list.\nAlthough Silbert is bullish on the ETC token, he isn\u2019t currently interested in many of the applications that have been pitched for the platform. \u201cA lot [of] ideas on the Ethereum Classic side suffer from some of the same issues as Ethereum \u2014 as in why decentralize or use Ethereum?\u201d he said.\nFrom DCG\u2019s perspective, ETC is a useful diversification tool for a digital currency portfolio. According to Silbert, bitcoin is the only asset that should take up the rest of that portfolio. DCG also sees value in Ethereum Classic as a smart-contract platform for the Internet of Things and as a micropayments layer.\nDCG currently holds ETC in its portfolio, and they\u2019re also exploring the possibility of getting involved in the mining of ETC.\nInvesting in the RSK Labs Team\nIn addition to the ETC token, DCG is also invested in RSK Labs, which is the company working on Rootstock. According to Silbert, the investment in RSK Labs was mainly about the team more than anything else. This is part of DCG\u2019s overall strategy when investing in startups \u2014 it considers the team first, then the market opportunity, and finally the product.\nIn addition to RSK Labs, DCG has also invested in companies that allow users to trade ETH and ETC. Some of the companies DCG has invested in also use private, permissioned versions of the Ethereum blockchain.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 9}

And Bob has 1 bitcoin, but prefers 200 litecoins. So Alice and Bob agree to trade. But neither Alice nor Bob trust each other, so neither wants to be the first to send over the coins. The other may not return the favor.\nThat\u2019s why Alice and Bob set up an atomic swap.\nAtomic swaps utilize a clever trick known as a hash time-locked contract, which in turn leverages the potential of multisignature addresses and time-locks. All this is enabled by the basic scripting language found in Bitcoin and most altcoins, including Litecoin.\nIn short, Alice and Bob submit transactions to both blockchains: one on Bitcoin and one on Litecoin. The Bitcoin transaction sends 1 bitcoin from Bob to Alice, but Alice can only claim this bitcoin if she reveals a secret number only she knows. The Litecoin transaction sends 200 litecoins from Alice to Bob, but requires the same secret number on both chains.\nWhen Alice claims her bitcoin, she reveals her secret number on the Bitcoin blockchain. And with that same secret number, Bob can, in turn, claim his 200 litecoins.\nEven though the transactions are on completely different blockchains, they are effectively linked. Bob just needs to monitor the Bitcoin blockchain to see if Alice claimed her bitcoin so that he can claim his litecoins.\nAll this works today. But it is a bit of a hassle. Alice and Bob need to find each other to set up the atomic swap, which then requires several transactions on multiple blockchains.\nThis can be improved.\n(Note: there are some extra steps to ensure that Alice actually does claim her bitcoin within a limited amount of time so that Bob can also claim his litecoins in a timely manner. The specifics are beyond the scope of this article; however, for details on how hash time-locked contracts work, see\u00a0Understanding the Lightning Network, Part 2: Creating the Network.)\nLightning Network(s)\nThe lightning network is specifically designed for Bitcoin. But altcoins that are forked from Bitcoin\u2019s codebase \u2014 like Litecoin, Dogecoin or Zcash \u2014 are typically capable of hosting lightning networks as well. Other altcoins, as long as they include similar or more extensive scripting capabilities (like Ethereum or Ethereum Classic), enable similar solutions.\nLike atomic swaps, the lightning network utilizes hash time-locked contracts. Where atomic swaps effectively link blockchains, the lightning network links payment channels. This way, if both Alice and Bob have a payment channel open with Carol, they can transact through Carol, without needing to trust Carol.\nAnd exactly because the underlying mechanics are the same, it\u2019s no stretch to merge the lightning network with atomic swaps. This process makes different lightning networks interoperable across blockchains.\nThis means that a peer that opens channels on both blockchains could serve as a payment processor, an altcoin exchange and more.\nLet\u2019s say, for example, that Alice wants to buy a computer from Bob, for which Bob charges 1 bitcoin, but Alice only owns litecoins. Luckily, Carol has a Litecoin channel open with Alice, and a Bitcoin channel open with Bob. So Alice can now send 200 litecoins to Carol, for Carol to send 1 bitcoin to Bob. Since this is all linked with hash time-locked contracts, Carol effectively acts as a trustless payment processor.\nAnd if Alice and Bob both have a Bitcoin payment channel as well as a Litecoin channel with Carol, they can also swap funds. Alice can send 200 litecoins to Carol, which Carol forwards to Bob. Bob then sends 1 bitcoin to Carol in exchange, which Carol now forwards to Alice. And again, all this is still linked with hash time-locked contracts, so now Carol effectively acts as a trustless altcoin exchange.\nLastly, alternative lightning networks may even improve Bitcoin\u2019s lightning network in some ways. For example, a bitcoin-to-bitcoin payment could be routed through Litecoin peers, if that happens to be the cheapest route. Or, users operating on multiple coins could rebalance their channels. If Alice has 400 litecoins but no bitcoins in her channel with Bob, she may want to exchange 200 litecoins to fund her Bitcoin channel.\nChallenges\nSome challenges do remain in order to realize most of this scenario.\nOne is denial of service (DoS) protection. While the mechanics of the lightning network ensure that no peers can steal funds, intermediaries can block or stall the payment process. To solve this, channels with non-cooperating peers must be closed. This form of punishment should make DoS attacks expensive, as non-cooperating peers need to keep opening channels.\nBut to verify that the channel was closed and the attacker punished, each peer along a payment chain must be able to monitor all participants. Even if only two peers along a chain of six use Litecoin, all six peers should be able to recognize a Litecoin transaction in case the channel is closed.\nAnd of course, lightning networks must first be rolled out. This, in most cases, requires a malleability fix, at least for optimal performance. Segregated Witness \u2014 the malleability fix proposed by the Bitcoin Core development team \u2014 currently awaits activation on both the Bitcoin network and on several altcoins, including Litecoin.\nBut Segregated Witness has not activated yet, and whether it ever will depends on miners \u2014 both on Bitcoin as well as on altcoins.\nThanks to Amiko Pay developer Corn\u00e9 Plooy and Litecoin inventor Charlie Lee for input. Lee also wrote about the potential of linking Bitcoin and Litecoin lightning networks here.\nFor specifics on how the lightning network works, see Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s three-part series.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 11}

PBOC representatives in Beijing met with OKCoin and Huobi while PBOC representatives in Shanghai met with BTCC.\nOn the evening of Friday, January 6 in China, the PBOC offices in Beijing and Shanghai both issued statements on the meetings, noting that the \u201crecent bitcoin price is highly volatile\u201d and that the bank encourages the exchanges to \u201coperate strictly in accordance with the laws and regulations of China and to conduct self-examination based on related laws and correct any possible irregularities.\u201d\nThe statements also urged citizens to \u201cinvest with rationale in bitcoin and thus bear the possible risks on their own.\u201d\nThe PBOC\u2019s full statements can be found below.\nHuobi, OKCoin and BTCC account for 90 percent of Bitcoin\u2019s global trading volume and saw prices near historical highs in the past 36 hours before they fell dramatically.\nZhu Jiawei, COO of Huobi, confirmed with Bitcoin Magazine that the exchange met with the PBOC and gave the following statement:\n\n\u201cHuobi will conduct strict self inspection according to requirements from PBOC and other authorities, and laws and regulations. Huobi also plans to establish an industry association with other companies to promote self discipline, and the formation of industry standards.\u201d\n\nJiawei added the warning that \u201cinvestors should control the risk because bitcoin is an investment product with high risk, traded 24/7 and without limitation on the value fluctuation.\u201d\nBTCC also confirmed meeting with the PBOC and issued the following statement:\n\n\u201cBTCC regularly meets with the PBOC and we work closely with them to ensure that we are operating in accordance with the laws and regulations of China. As the longest running exchange in the world, we have always adhered to strict AML/KYC policies and continue to be compliant with all current regulations in China. The press release put forth from the PBOC today outlines that there is significant volatility in bitcoin trading, and also quoted from a notice released in 2013 saying that bitcoin is a virtual good and doesn\u2019t have legal tender status. All of our users should be aware of the current policies on virtual goods as well as the risks involved in trading in volatile markets.\u201d\n\nOKCoin has not yet responded to requests for comment from Bitcoin Magazine.\nThe PBOC has been meeting with exchanges on a semi-regular basis in recent months. However, the timing of these meetings and the nature of the statements suggest that they were a direct result of recent dramatic price movement.\nChina\u2019s financial markets have a long history of government involvement and intervention. The fact that the PBOC is making public statements about bitcoin and reaffirming its own commitment to ensuring the operational integrity of exchanges in the country could be interpreted as a recognition of bitcoin\u2019s increasing viability.\nFrom the trading perspective of bitcoin\u2019s price movement and the PBOC\u2019s statement, BitMex\u2019s Arthur Hayes commented, \u201cThe PBOC didn't say anything new. They crushed CNH shorts and BTC longs this year. The trade is clear: short CNH or CNY and buy bitcoin.\u201d\nInterestingly, the price of bitcoin cratered just as it reached 8,888 CNY. Eight is regarded as the luckiest number in Chinese culture and appears to have been a profit-taking point for many investors.\n\nStatement from BPOC Shanghai:\n\n\nThe recent bitcoin price is highly volatile. To prevent risks and uphold financial stability, PBOC Shanghai and Financial Office of Shanghai have jointly met the major heads of BTCC to know the current status of Bitcoin trading. \u201cWe have reminded BTCC of the possible risks and require it to operate strictly in accordance with the laws and regulations of China.

His surprise announcement caused chaos in the country as citizens scrambled to adjust to a new monetary norm that banned about 85 percent of cash in circulation.\nThis move was meant to bring billions of dollars worth of unaccounted money back into India\u2019s economy. The Indian economy has thus far run primarily on cash transactions. This, in turn, has left a substantial proportion of India\u2019s national income unaccounted for, as it doesn\u2019t fall into the tax net. According to a research note by Ambit Capital Research, the size of India\u2019s untaxed black market economy is worth $460 billion. In a \u201ccashless\u201d India, financial transactions will be more easily traceable, and previously unaccounted transactions will not fall through the net of the tax authorities.\nThe demonetization of the two highest-denomination notes in India has led to an increase in the use of electronic payment services and is a big step toward a cashless society. This, in turn, has two key benefactors: e-money payment companies and bitcoin.\nE-Money Stocks Are Rallying\nAs reported by\u00a0Bloomberg, e-money stocks have soared since Prime Minister Modi announced that he wants India to become a cashless society. India\u2019s publicly listed electronic cash companies\u2019 stock prices have surged in the wake of the currency reform in November. They are expected to continue to outperform since the government has introduced a range of discounts for making digital instead of cash payments.\nOf the 23 e-payment solutions companies listed on India\u2019s National Stock Exchange, 5 have been key outperformers since the new currency reform.\nThe stock prices of e-commerce software developers Intense Technologies Ltd. and Vedavaag Systems Ltd. increased by over 50 percent, while e-payment service provider RS Software India Ltd., technology solutions provider Aurionpro Solutions Ltd. and telecom solutions provider Tanla Solutions Ltd. have all rallied by over 20 percent.\nOn the day after the announcement, Credit Suisse Singapore made a strategic investment in Vakrangee Ltd., which provides digital financial services to governments and lenders, by buying 3.83 million shares in the firm and thereby signaling that it is prepared to bet on the profitable future of this sector in India.\nA. K. Prabhakar, Head of Research at\u00a0IDBI Capital in Mumbai, told Bloomberg that his team expects \u201cdouble-digit revenues growth for e-governance firms over the next 3 to 4 years if the government systematically encourages cashless transactions\u201d and that \u201cgrowth in digital modes of payments will continue to be strong if the safety is increased and charges are reduced.\u201d\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of India, digital payments have increased by almost 50 percent from November to December, which shows that the shift toward a cashless economy is happening despite initial chaos in the country. This development will bode well for e-payment solutions providers and mobile money services.\nBitcoin Is Booming in India\nIndia\u2019s aggressive move toward becoming a cashless society, however, is not only benefiting e-money companies. It has also created a boom for bitcoin in the world\u2019s seventh largest economy.\nAccording to data compiled by\u00a0Coin Dance, trading volumes at peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins has spiked aggressively in India since November 9, while leading Indian bitcoin exchanges\u00a0Zebpay, Unocoin and Coinsecure are witnessing a surge of new users coming onto their platform to exchange rupees for bitcoins.\nAccording to Zebpay Co-Founder Saurabh Agarwal, Zebpay\u2019s trade volumes have increased by 25 percent from October to November; they have had 50,000 new users sign up to their exchange in the month of November alone, well above the usual 20,000 new-user increases they have experienced in previous months.\nCoinsecure experienced a 300 percent increase in user sign-ups in November, while Unocoin had their user base increase threefold in the wake of India\u2019s currency reform. \u00a0\nWhile bitcoin merchant adoption is still next to none in India, the new currency reform and the subsequent push toward digital payments will give bitcoin a boost as a means of making online payments. More merchant adoption will also lead to more individuals adopting the digital currency, which, in turn, will help bitcoin flourish in India\u2019s future cashless society. \u00a0", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 11}

As a minor release, the latest version of the Bitcoin Core software features bug fixes and performance improvements.\nThe most notable update is a change to wallet handling of mempool rejection. This enables more graceful recovery from specific edge cases where transactions depend on other unconfirmed transactions. In other words, it prevents transactions from getting stuck in the wallet and ensures that the Bitcoin Core software doesn\u2019t need to be restarted to fix the issue.\nTo be specific, Bitcoin Core developer and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo explained during an interview with Bitcoin Magazine that the \u201csendtoaddress\u201d and \u201csendmany\u201d RPC calls merge several operations, which may make proper error handling difficult.\n\u201cIn the Ciphrex application development stack, we use multiple calls to send transactions: Create, Sign, Send. Bitcoin Core also does this for the lower-level raw transaction processing calls,\" Lombrozo told Bitcoin Magazine.\n\"I still think the send RPC calls combine too many operations into a single call, which makes it hard to do proper error handling as an application developer. But this change at least allows for more graceful recovery from a specific edge case,\u201d Lombrozo added.\nAdoption Rate and SegWit\nFor normal, everyday users, the change from Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 will probably not be a big one. Like Bitcoin Core 0.13.1, Bitcoin Core 0.13.2 includes code for the Segregated Witness soft fork \u2014 but activation of course depends on miners. Users are not required to upgrade to Bitcoin Core 0.13.2 in order to remain part of the Bitcoin network, though it is advised.\nWithin a week since the release of Bitcoin Core 0.13.2, over 12 percent of reachable Bitcoin nodes as stated by Bitnodes have already upgraded to the new release.\nThe release of 0.13.2 also marks the first minor upgrade of the Bitcoin software in 2017. Bitcoin experts, including Andreas Antonopoulos and Bitcoin Core developer Jonas Schnelli, unanimously agreed that 2016 was an important year in Bitcoin development and innovation.\nSchnelli revealed that 517 Github contributors played an active role in the development of Bitcoin, and nearly 4.5 commits were made on a daily basis throughout the year.

Hodls BTC. (tip address / tippin.me / PayNym)\nThe decentralized bitcoin and altcoin exchange\u00a0Bitsquare has decided that it must rebrand or face a costly legal battle.\nLaunched\u00a0last year, Bitsquare is the first decentralized bitcoin and altcoin exchange of its kind. Instead of trading bitcoin through a central intermediary as a typical exchange would, Bitsquare users connect through a peer-to-peer protocol and exchange money directly. To keep everyone honest, traders put up security deposits, while an arbitration system serves as a fallback.\nThe open-source project led by Manfred Karrer recently ran into a setback, however, as the team tried to register the Bitsquare trademark. Payment processor\u00a0Square contends that the name Bitsquare is too close to their registered trademark and opposes the registration.\nRather than fighting to keep the name Bitsquare, the team behind the decentralized exchange decided it will pick a new name.\n\u201cWe would have preferred to keep using the name Bitsquare, but we sought professional legal advice from two independent lawyers, and it appears the odds are stacked against us. Given that fact, we\u2019ll focus our limited resources on improving the platform, rather than on a lengthy and expensive legal process,\u201d Karrer told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick a new name.\u201d\nThe Bitsquare team is currently asking the community for input on a new name on the Bitsquare forum. Karrer will personally award the person who comes up with the winning name \u2014 to be decided by the Bitsquare team \u2014 with 0.5 bitcoin.\nDespite the slight setback, Bitsquare itself has been doing well, Karrer said. After a slow start in April of last year, volume on the decentralized exchange has increased organically over time. The number of successful trades on Bitsquare grows each month, with monero, \u00a0the euro and the US dollar ranking as the most traded currencies. (All trades on Bitsquare happen against bitcoin.)\n\u201cWe saw the biggest increase of users in times where centralized solutions were conspicuously failing,\u201d Karrer explained. \u201cMost notably, the Bitfinex hack seemed to be a clear signal to many people that their funds are not safe on centralized exchanges. Similarly, we saw an uptick around the The DAO debacle and the subsequent Ethereum hard fork, where centralized exchanges attempted to impose what the real Ethereum chain was on their users.\u201d\nThough, as Karrer noted, Bitsquare itself is still a work in progress as well. Volume on the decentralized exchange is still low compared to alternatives. And while rare, there have been some failed trades where arbitrators had to step in to reimburse funds, especially in the volatile altcoin markets. Future versions of Bitsquare will therefore include a more flexible deposit system, while the software will also be extended with APIs that can be linked, for example, to Bitcoin ATMs. For added security, integration with the Trezor hardware wallet is also in the works.\nAs an even more ambitious step in the development process, Karrer plans to turn Bitsquare into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) later this year. It is a tainted term since the Ethereum debacle carrying the same name, Karrer acknowledged, but he believes it to be a crucial step to ensure long-term sustainability of the project.\n\u201cMuch like Bitcoin itself, it is important that Bitsquare has no single point of failure. Of course, the code is already open source, and the protocol peer-to-peer, but ideally management of the project would further decentralize over time as well,\u201d he said.\nFor now, however, Bitsquare first needs a new name.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 12}

His work has been featured in VICE Motherboard, Business Insider, NASDAQ, New York Post,The Next Web, American Banker, and other media outlets. You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nFor the past two years, the main topic of conversation in the Bitcoin community has been the scalability debate. While the peer-to-peer digital currency system processes more than 300,000 on-blockchain transactions per day and recently reached an $18 billion market cap for the first time, the path toward scaling this system to a global economy over the long-term is sometimes seen as unclear.\nAfter years of debate over Bitcoin\u2019s effective transaction capacity limit, the plan for capacity increases that has gained the highest level of support from current Bitcoin Core contributors, bitcoin wallet providers and bitcoin miners was put forth by Blockstream CTO and Bitcoin Core contributor Gregory Maxwell in December of 2015.\nMaxwell\u2019s plan includes a variety of changes to the protocol to improve the usefulness of various second-layer approaches to scaling Bitcoin, such as the lightning network. The most recent improvement released as part of this scaling roadmap is called Segregated Witness, and it includes an effective doubling of Bitcoin\u2019s block-size limit.\nThere were a number of other proposals made for scaling Bitcoin over the years, and at least one developer, Mike Hearn, left the project entirely after his preferred solution was not implemented by the Bitcoin community. In a widely circulated blog post published roughly one year ago, Hearn claimed that the Bitcoin experiment had failed.\nIn the time since Hearn\u2019s departure, which BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen referred to as a \u201cwhiny ragequit,\u201d the bitcoin price has nearly doubled.\nBitcoin Price Rises Despite Network Congestion Concerns\nOne of the main reasons Hearn referred to Bitcoin as a failed experiment had to do with network congestion. The effective limit on the number of transactions that the Bitcoin network can process has not been raised, and blocks were effectively full with a backlog of pending transactions on more than one occasion this past year.\nSome in the Bitcoin community believed this network congestion would effectively block new people from entering the Bitcoin ecosystem or at least turn off new users via higher fees and longer payment confirmation times.\nIt\u2019s likely true that at least a few potential new users decided not to use Bitcoin in 2016 because of the perceived issues associated with full blocks. The reason the bitcoin price continued to rise in 2016 despite this network congestion may have to do with the fact that those who are using bitcoin primarily as a store of value aren\u2019t much affected by network congestion.\nAfter all, in order to use bitcoin as a store of value, users technically only need to complete two transactions, potentially years apart: one for buying the bitcoins and one for selling the bitcoins. Those who decide to take $1 million and put it into bitcoin are the ones who have the greatest effect on the price. Those who are simply transacting via the Bitcoin network as a payment rails will have a buy and sell order on both sides of their transactions, which therefore has a marginal effect on the overall price.\nThose Who Need Bitcoin Are Willing to Pay Higher Fees\nOutside of use for philosophical reasons, there still aren\u2019t many use cases for Bitcoin. Having said that, the use cases that do exist usually involve situations where there is simply no other solution on the market. For these use cases, demand for Bitcoin tends to be inelastic. This isn\u2019t to say there aren\u2019t some transactional use cases of Bitcoin that are being priced out by higher fees.\nFor example, someone who has been victimized by a hacker by way of ransomware has no option other than Bitcoin to make that ransom payment. If the ransomware victim feels he or she has to make the ransom payment in order to regain access to their files, then they aren\u2019t too concerned with what type of fee will need to be attached to their payment (within practical limits).\nThose who view bitcoin as a store of value also fall under this category as there is no competition with bitcoin in the \u201cdigital gold\u201d market. Yes, alternative digital currencies exist, but they have roughly zero non-speculative use cases and they\u2019re often viewed as nothing more than testnets for Bitcoin. For this reason, Bloq Economist Paul Sztorc refers to them as \u201ctestnet scams.\u201d Anyone who wants to use an algorithmically controlled store of value will need to pay the necessary fees to gain access to the bitcoin tokens.\nBitcoin Still Needs to Scale for Payments\nAlthough clear, reliable Bitcoin user statistics can be difficult to analyze, there are indications that most people use bitcoin as a store of value. Having said that, it still makes sense to make improvements to make sure bitcoin also works well as a medium of exchange. Although bitcoin could do quite well as a store of value that is somewhat difficult to move around, a large amount of value can be added by helping the technology fulfill its original, overstated promise of free, instant and anonymous online transactions.\nThere is a variety of potential solutions in the works when it comes to fulfilling these key aspects of bitcoin as a digital bearer asset, and many of them were on display at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in October. The most helpful advancements may be the ones that are able to improve scalability and user privacy at the same time, such as lightning networks or TumbleBit.\nAdding new features to Bitcoin can be extremely difficult when it is supposed to be an apolitical, algorithmic store of value. For this reason, privacy and scalability improvements are rolled out in a backward-compatible manner in a process known as a soft fork.\nHard forks, or changes that are incompatible with Bitcoin\u2019s current consensus rules, may also be possible, but some investors, such as Needham & Company, are concerned with the potential negative effects a split of the network into two separate assets could have on the perception of bitcoin as a digital gold.\nThis is an op-ed by Kyle Torpey.

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nA few weeks ago, the relatively new India-based bitcoin mining pool GBMiners decided to switch their software from Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin Unlimited. Bitcoin Unlimited is software that creates an alternative protocol and network based on Bitcoin, if a majority of miners decide to implement a new method for increasing Bitcoin\u2019s current block size limit.\nWhether Bitcoin Unlimited would initiate a Bitcoin hard fork or effectively constitute the creation of an altcoin depends on what people decide to refer to as Bitcoin after the new chain is activated.\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to GBMiners to learn more about why they decided to make the switch to Bitcoin Unlimited. GBMiners Founder Amit Bhardwaj responded on behalf of the mining pool.\nSegregated Witness Is Not the Right Solution\nLike many others who would like to see transaction capacity increased on the Bitcoin network via a hard fork, Bhardwaj displayed urgency in his reasoning for switching to Bitcoin Unlimited. \u201cIt is high time when bitcoin needs to scale,\u201d he said. \u201cThe transaction fees are going higher and higher, and [the] real essence of bitcoin lies in its use [as an] affordable currency.\u201d\nBhardwaj referred to Segregated Witness (SegWit), a proposed soft-forking (backward compatible) change to Bitcoin that includes an increase in the effective block size limit to more than 2 MB (after users upgrade to SegWit-enabled wallets), as a \u201csmall to medium level increase in the network capacity.\u201d In his view, Bitcoin Unlimited offers the best long-term scaling solution without altering how Bitcoin has worked in the past.\nAlthough some would consider the increase to the block size limit enabled by Segregated Witness as modest, one of the main points of this protocol change is to enable a more efficient version of lightning networks. To this point, Bhardwaj argued, \u201cIt might work for things like micropayments, but if we consider bitcoin becoming a mainstream currency and people getting their salaries in bitcoin, then even post-SegWit we would need a block size increase.\u201d\nWhen asked for further details on why Segregated Witness is not an acceptable improvement for Bitcoin, Bhardwaj pointed to a Medium post from a pseudonymous author that talks about the change as an ineffective and irresponsible protocol upgrade.\n\u201cThe technical debt that the update adds to the network is the biggest concern,\u201d said Bhardwaj. \u201cWe are not able to predict the impact of such a big change to the underlying operation of the bitcoin transactions. SegWit comes with its own complexities \u2014 the downsides of which are completely unknown to us.\u201d\nIn Bhardwaj\u2019s view, a block size increase is needed as soon as possible via a hard fork, which he believes would come with less code complexity and no unforeseen bugs. \u201cIt is a simple change where the active community of miners, wallets and exchanges just have to coordinate and upgrade,\u201d said Bhardwaj. \u201cIt makes all the sense in the world to first do the thing with less uncertainty and low probability of failure. Also, we are not fundamentally against SegWit. It just is not the best solution for the biggest and the most important problem at hand, which is scaling.\u201d\nAlthough Bhardwaj is against Segregated Witness as a solution to Bitcoin\u2019s scaling concerns, he does see value in other features enabled by the improvement proposal.\nHow to Hard Fork Safely With Bitcoin Unlimited\nWhile Bhardwaj claims increasing the block size limit via a hard fork is not a complex alteration in terms of code changes, the controversial aspect of such a change is that it requires a hard fork (and thus all users moving over to a new network), which can be difficult to coordinate\u2014unless the proposed change is itself uncontroversial.\nWhen asked how a hard fork could be pulled off in a safe manner, Bhardwaj pointed to another Medium post, which was published by the ViaBTC bitcoin mining pool. The post is essentially a safety guide for miners who wish to run Bitcoin Unlimited instead of Bitcoin Core.\nIn the post from ViaBTC, it is recommended that miners wait for at least 75 percent of blocks to be mined by mining pools that are signaling for Bitcoin Unlimited for three straight difficulty periods (roughly six weeks). Having said that, Bhardwaj believes a hard fork initiated by miners running Bitcoin Unlimited only needs more than 60 percent support from the network hashrate to be considered safe.\nOne of the main concerns with any hard fork is the potential for the fork to result in two competing blockchains, essentially splitting the Bitcoin network in half. This is what happened on the Ethereum network when the hard-forking bailout of DAO token holders led to two competing chains: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\n\u201cWe believe if the hard fork is executed as per the Bitcoin Unlimited plan, we would be able to prevent splitting or at least make the new Bitcoin [the] primary one,\u201d said Bhardwaj when asked about the potential for a network split.\nIn a scenario where there is indeed a split of Bitcoin into two separate networks, Bhardwaj claimed such a scenario would be a \u201cminor set back in the large vision of Bitcoin.\u201d\nThoughts on Bitcoin Core Developers\nIn addition to his support for Bitcoin Unlimited, Bhardwaj also feels that the various contributors who work on Bitcoin Core are incapable of handling further development of the Bitcoin protocol on behalf of its users.\n\u201cThe scaling problem [has been] actively discussed for the past three years now, and yet, the community has not been able to come to a consensus,\u201d said Bhardwaj. \u201cIt is extremely clear that the people we are banking on to take care of the development of the protocol are probably not able to do justice to the expectations of its users despite their best intentions. The present stalemate is a clear example; the transaction fees on the system [are at an] all-time high, and SegWit adoption has stagnated.\u201d\nWhen asked if he has ever communicated with any of the Bitcoin Core contributors, Bhardwaj first responded that the ideas of Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Core need to be merged to produce the best possible version of Bitcoin. When pushed further, Bhardwaj responded, \u201cNo, we [have] not connected to any Bitcoin Core Developer yet.\u201d\nAccording to one Bitcoin Core contributor, multiple attempts have been made at opening a dialogue with GBMiners.\nIn his final comments, Bhardwaj clarified that GBMiners has nothing against the group of Bitcoin Core contributors currently working on the project. \u201cWe have immense love and respect for their efforts so far, but our love for making bitcoin a currency for the masses is fundamentally greater,\u201d he said.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 12}

This rally has put bitcoin back into the public light, with global media reporting on bitcoin and once again asking questions about regulation, bitcoin as an investment, and the possible future of bitcoin and digital currencies.\nWelcome Back, Volatility!\nWithin 48 hours of bitcoin reaching its three-year high, the price of bitcoin dropped by 28 percent, from around $1,150 to a low of $830, giving investors a stern reminder that digital currencies are an extremely volatile asset class.\nThroughout last week, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) had meetings with leading Chinese bitcoin exchanges OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC to remind them \u201cto conduct self-examination based on related laws and correct any possible irregularities\u201d and to \u201coperate strictly in accordance with the laws and regulations of China.\u201d The PBOC then went on to issue a warning to the general public, highlighting the risks involved in investing in bitcoin and other digital currencies and stating that Chinese citizens \u201cshould invest with rationale in bitcoin.\u201d\nThe initial drop from its three-year high was most likely driven by profit-taking from larger investors and a strengthening Yuan. As the price of bitcoin had already dropped before the PBOC\u2019s statement was issued, the word that exchanges were called in by the Chinese central bank to discuss bitcoin\u2019s price development and volatility may have gotten out and led the price to drop further. Following the meetings, the PBOC\u2019s latest comments regarding the digital currency gave it a final push lower before it recovered again around the $900 mark.\nWhile the price of bitcoin reacted negatively to the PBOC\u2019s statement, the reality is that it should actually be viewed as bitcoin-positive. The Chinese regulator meeting with leading exchanges to discuss better regulation and stricter operational controls is sending a clear signal that bitcoin is being accepted as an investable virtual asset.\nThe price of bitcoin, however, took another dive on January 11th when it was made public that the Chinese central bank made on-site inspections at the three leading bitcoin exchanges to investigate potential market manipulation, unauthorized financing and money laundering. This news sent the price of bitcoin plummeting from around $917 to a low of $761 in the 24 hours to follow.\nWhile bitcoin is not considered legal tender, according to the PBOC, it is recognized as a virtual asset and there are no regulatory or legal restrictions when it comes to investing in bitcoin in China.\n2013 All Over Again\nInterestingly, in the last few weeks, we were able to witness almost the same bitcoin bull market as in late 2013, when bitcoin hit its all-time high of $1,216.73 on the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.\nThroughout the second half of 2016, the price of bitcoin rallied due to a genuine increase in demand from China, India and other emerging markets. Then the mass media took notice, fuelling the rally further to give it a bubble-like feeling, and then, as happens in bull markets, newer, less-experienced investors entered the market to get their share of the \u201cgold rush.\u201d Then the PBOC issued a warning to the public about the riskiness of bitcoin investing, and the rally came to an abrupt halt.\nBack in 2013, bitcoin\u2019s impressive rally from $133 in September to $1,216 in mid-November was also put to a halt by the Chinese authorities when the PBOC issued a joint statement with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and other financial regulators, warning Chinese banks and payment companies away from dealing with bitcoin. This action subsequently led to a steep drop in bitcoin\u2019s price from over $1,000 to $450 within six months.\nGiven that over 90 percent of bitcoin trading activity occurs on Chinese exchanges, the People\u2019s Republic and its authorities\u2019 statements and actions will always be a key bitcoin price driver that digital currency investors need to keep a close eye on. \u00a0\nThe price drop was further exacerbated by the Mt. Gox hack in February 2014, which led to the bankruptcy of the exchange and the loss of $460 million worth of bitcoins. The Japanese exchange was one of the largest exchanges in the world at that time. Following the announcement of the size of the hack, many bitcoin investors sold their holdings in anticipation of the hacker flooding the market with coins to turn his or her stolen coins back into fiat currency. This led to the price of bitcoin moving another leg lower in the months to follow. Perhaps even more damaging were the security concerns surrounding bitcoin trading; the negative fallout left a dark shadow on the digital currency for many months to come.\nThus far, however, there is no reason to believe that another Mt. Gox\u2013like disaster will befall bitcoin in the wake of this most recent price rise and fall.\nBitcoin\u2019s Fair Value\nThe real challenge as a bitcoin investor is to determine bitcoin\u2019s fair value. In the traditional financial industry, there are financial models and ratios that are used to assess the fair value of a financial asset. In the digital currency space, such models also exist. However, these models use inputs based on vague assumptions that make them unreliable to the extent that there is not much point in basing your investment decisions on them. \u00a0\nFor example, the model used to assess the value of bitcoin back in 2013 by\u00a0investment bank Merrill Lynch suggested that bitcoin\u2019s fair value should be $1,300 and its market capitalization should be around at $15 billion. While this prediction doesn\u2019t actually seem too far off today, the underlying input assumptions for this model included that bitcoin will be used for 10 percent of global online shopping transactions, which would account for a market cap of around $5 billion. Furthermore, it made the assumption that bitcoin would take a substantial market share from leading money transfer operators Western Union and MoneyGram and, therefore, increase its market share roughly to the market capitalization of these companies, which lay at around $4.5 billion at the time of the report. The model further assumed that the velocity of money globally will be at the same level as the U.S. 10-year average from 2003 to 2013, 0.04, and that bitcoin will eventually reach the same recognition as a store of value as silver, which added another $5 billion of market cap. This is how the $15 billion market capitalization was calculated and the value of $1,300 determined.\nAs we know today, these assumptions were incorrect as bitcoin is nowhere near being used for 10 percent of online transactions, nor is it in any real way a competitor to the large money transfer operators. Nonetheless, its market capitalization has surpassed that suggested by Merrill Lynch, and it is looking more likely that the price of bitcoin will greatly surpass their price target.\nOther models look at bitcoin\u2019s monetary base, which is driven by reservation demand and transactional demand for the currency. Reservation demand refers to the amount of bitcoins being saved or held for investment proposes, while transactional demand refers to the amount of bitcoin being used to pay for goods and services.\nAn example of this type of bitcoin fair price model would be the\u00a0model created by Joseph C. Wang that aims to derive bitcoin\u2019s value from the economic equation of exchange. Wang argues that the value of bitcoin \u201cwill be almost solely determined by the willingness of bitcoin holders to pull bitcoin out of circulation\u201d as opposed to its increase in circulation as a spending currency. However, Wang cautions about the correctness of his model, as it will need to be proven by \u201cfuture empirical observations in the bitcoin market,\u201d and thereby he reiterates the difficulty of determining the fair value of bitcoin with any level of accuracy.\nSo Is Now a Good Time to Buy or Not?\nThe best way to approach bitcoin from an investment point of view is to consider it like any other high-risk investment since it is effectively impossible to determine its fair value. Hence, only invest as much as you can afford to lose. The reality is that despite bitcoin\u2019s recent rally, it can also lose half its value within a matter of months, as we witnessed back in 2014.\nMany argue that things are different now as the bitcoin economy is much bigger, the ecosystem surrounding bitcoin is much more stable and regulators have taken a more positive stance toward bitcoin than they did originally. While these are all valid points, the reality is that no one really knows what the fair value of bitcoin should be and whether the price increase is driven by actual demand for a transactional currency or purely by speculators looking to take advantage of short- to medium-term price jumps.\nBitcoin is still in its infancy and its future is still uncertain. Both these factors are reflected in its price and its regular clusters of aggressive volatility. If you are a risk-loving investor and believe in the long-term potential of bitcoin, then it doesn\u2019t make much of a difference whether you buy today or tomorrow, as the future price of bitcoin could be a multiple of today\u2019s price \u2014 or not.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 12}

You can view all his work at\u00a0kyletorpey.com\u00a0or sign up for his personal newsletter.\nBitcoin, digital currency and blockchain technology experienced another explosive year in 2016. While bitcoin breached the all-time high in USD market cap, several new digital currencies claimed a place in the spotlights as well, while the blockchain buzz arguably peaked it all.\nOf course, Bitcoin Magazine kept up with all of it. Looking back on 2016, we compiled three top 6 lists, with our best-read topics in technology, business and news.\nThese were 2016\u2019s six top developments in business, by popularity.\n6: Circle Continues Its Move Away From Bitcoin\nIn a move that should not have come as a surprise, payments application Circle continued their pivot away from Bitcoin and toward more general, blockchain-based solutions in 2016. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire even went so far as to claim that it\u2019s highly unlikely anyone will be using Bitcoin in five or ten years.\nShortly thereafter, Circle announced that they would no longer allow users to buy and sell bitcoin on their platform. The company still uses Bitcoin in the background for settlement purposes, although they\u2019ve now also integrated other blockchain solutions. Circle users can also still use the platform as an effective bitcoin bank where the payments company stores bitcoins for them.\nAllaire has noted his frustration with what he perceives as the slow speed of development in Bitcoin on multiple occasions. Circle\u2019s move away from Bitcoin is a story that could continue to develop further in 2017.\nFor now, it secured a top 6 spot in our list for 2016.\n5: Santander Uses Blockchain Technology for International Payments\nWhile the debate between Bitcoin and blockchain technology has raged for a couple of years now, 2016 saw the rollout of an actual consumer application from a big bank based on blockchain technology. In June, Santander U.K. announced the introduction of a pilot application that allows users to make international payments by way of blockchain technology.\nIn their announcement of the application, Santander\u2019s Sigga Sigurdardottir claimed that blockchain technology will play a transformational role in the way the bank achieves their goals in the coming years.\nThe technology used by Santander in their payments application was developed by Ripple, a company in which the fintech venture capital wing of Santander Group has invested.\n4: Alphabay Integrates Monero\nSome may not think of AlphaBay when trying to come up with some of the most important businesses in the blockchain industry, but the darknet\u2019s largest market was able to put its own stamp on the digital currency space in 2016. Privacy-conscious altcoins are often a topic of conversation when it comes to the darknet markets, and AlphaBay brought this topic to the forefront again with their integration of Monero.\nAlphaBay was the second darknet market to implement Monero in 2016, although the other market, Oasis, appears to have run off with their users\u2019 money. In recent comments to Bitcoin Magazine, an AlphaBay support representative claimed Monero currently accounts for 2 percent of the market\u2019s business. The support representative also claimed that Zcash (another privacy-focused altcoin) integration could make sense in the future.\nAlthough some blockchain enthusiasts are not fans of the darknet markets, the reality is that they still play a large enough role in the development of this technology to merit the number-four most widely read business story on Bitcoin Magazine this year, for a top 4 spot on our list.\n3: Deutsche Bank Understands Blockchain Technology\u2019s Disruptive Potential\nThe year 2016 is when banks became more serious than ever about blockchain technology, and a statement from Deutsche Bank illustrated this sentiment early in the year. In a statement from February, the bank was quoted as saying, \u201cBanks must partner with fintech and digital currency businesses or risk disappearing altogether.\u201d\nDeutsche Bank is one of the members of the R3 consortium that has been researching blockchain technology on behalf of the member banks. 2016 also saw the release of Corda, which is a distributed ledger created by the R3 consortium.\nAlthough Deutsche Bank mentioned digital currencies in their statement, the bank\u2019s focus with financial technology has been on creating more convenient banking and payment solutions for their customers.\nDeutsche Bank has been working on partnerships with various fintech startups over the course of 2016 in an effort to keep up with disruptive financial technologies.\n2: Gem Launches Health Network With Philips Blockchain Lab\nIn April, Gem announced the launch of Gem Health, which is a network for developing healthcare applications powered by the Ethereum blockchain. Philips was the first major healthcare operator to join the Gem Health network.\nAccording to the Gem website, the Gem Health network allows for the creation of global healthcare data standards that do not compromise on privacy and security. Identity schemes and smart contract applications are executed against a shared data infrastructure on the platform. Earlier this year, Gem CEO Micah Winkelspecht told Bitcoin Magazine, \u201cA lot of companies were suffering from these same pain points \u2014 working with siloed data that we could bridge together.\u201d\nGem also announced a $7.1 million Series A funding round in the early days of 2016.\nWith that, the startup places second in our most popular business developments of the year.\n1: PwC Report Describes\u00a0Blockchain's Disruptive Impact\u00a0on Fintech\nThe top business story on Bitcoin Magazine in 2016 was a PwC report that found blockchain technology may disrupt traditional fintech startups. The report was based on a survey of 544 executives and top management personnel at various financial services companies around the world.\nAlthough the report also discussed the fintech industry more generally, blockchain technology was specifically mentioned on multiple occasions. The report found that \u201cblockchain technology may result in a radically different competitive future in the [financial services] industry.\u201d The potential value of smart contracts was also discussed in the report.\nThe report identified 700 blockchain companies, 150 of which they deemed worthy of being tracked. Only 83 percent of the respondents in the survey considered themselves at least moderately familiar with blockchain technology, which led PwC to conclude that a lack of understanding of this technology may lead to market participants underestimating the impact of the blockchain on their activities.", "year": 2017, "month": 1, "day": 2}
{"title": "Op Ed: The New Age of Blockchain Entrepreneurship", "url": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-the-new-age-of-blockchain-entrepreneurship-1483295661/", "birthday": "Jan 1, 2017  1:34 PM EST", "date": "2017-01-01 18:34:00", "content": "@AugurProject\n@BlockchainEDU\n@BlockchainCap as an EIR/Associate\nAs the new year approaches, many aspiring entrepreneurs may consider taking a leap into the world of Bitcoin, blockchains and distributed ledger technologies. Allow this to serve as a note of caution and advice. \u00a0\nMost important: This technology is growing up. (Not-so)-crazy ideas have become tangible proof-of-concepts with major institutions across a variety of industries. Some of these have shaped into live trials and, at the very end of the spectrum, are becoming full-blown product offerings. An example of this evolution was recently demonstrated by Visa and Chain\u2019s B2B Connect keynote announcement at Money20/20 in November.\nAs a consequence of such developments in this nascent industry, entrepreneurs seeking to be taken seriously and raise money are now being held to a much higher standard than they were, say, two or three years ago, when the venture capital investment cycle began in earnest. There is a much greater comprehension of businesses that work and those that don\u2019t. As a general rule of thumb, attempting to build wallet software or a digital currency exchange would be misguided. First, wallets, of which there are already many, generally don\u2019t make money. And, while exchanges may be a lucrative business, it is important not to underestimate the power of incumbency.\nAlthough the history of financed distributed ledger\u2013related companies is only a few years old, anyone who has been around that long will agree that four years in \u201cblockchain time\u201d is the equivalent of decades in many other industries. Entrepreneurs who believe they can usurp Coinbase or Blockchain.info due to having \u201cbetter technology\u201d will be forced to confront the reality of this business faster than they can say \u201cdisintermediation\u201d (whether or not their tech is, in fact, superior).\nTo create a viable startup in this fast-moving, exhilarating industry, differentiation is key. Blockchain technology has moved far beyond the initial hype of bitcoin, payments and financial infrastructure. New enterprises abound in sectors ranging from real estate to healthcare, to entertainment and energy. As more large institutions, think tanks and consultancies contemplate the ramifications of distributed ledgers, smart contracts and beyond, use cases will continue to emerge out of the woodwork. Decentralization, however, has its limitations. The first wave of entrepreneurs in the Bitcoin space shouting \u201cdecentralize all the things\u201d came to recognize this quite quickly. Decentralization should always be a means to an end, not the end itself.\nBut even for the most viable, brilliant business ideas, the standard for investment is a high threshold to meet. Today, the teams receiving investments have pedigrees eons beyond what many early entrepreneurs in the ecosystem could ever have boasted of, for better or for worse. With Wall Street veterans piling into the industry\u2019s top financial firms (see Digital Asset Holdings or Ripple), creating viable competition can be near impossible. Elsewhere, most new startups are led by experienced executives in the respective fields they seek to disrupt (see Stem, Wave, or Abra). While that is not to say scrappy young entrepreneurs and hackers can\u2019t build viable enterprises \u2014 it\u2019s just all the harder to do so. Teaming up with expert co-founders, advisors and investors becomes increasingly more essential as this industry matures. Finding a strong niche and testing business hypotheses with such knowledgeable individuals are key to successful financings and businesses. \u00a0\nAt the moment, macroeconomic factors, both in this industry and the global economy at large, bode well for entrepreneurs. However, winds can shift at a moment\u2019s notice, and general venture capital sentiment is far from its bullish peak in 2015 (regarding any industry, save for maybe artificial intelligence). Those who successfully raise a seed round will indubitably experience the Series A crunch that will be both corrective for misaligned startups in the industry and extraordinarily painful for many. Beyond the first couple of stages of financing, it appears companies such as Ripple, Gem or Coinbase, as examples, are faring quite well and finding their mojo. But only time will determine their fates. It is important to note that there has yet to be a single venture-backed exit with meaningful (i.e., more than 1.5x) returns in this industry.\nHopefully, this does not discourage aspiring entrepreneurs from diving deep into blockchain tech. Rather, it should serve as a stern note of caution to those seeking to build a company around or upon this exciting new technological marvel. \u201cBlockchain\u201d may be a sexy buzzword, but it is a fundamentally unsexy technology \u2014 it is merely a distributed database. Keep that in mind before throwing it into a pitch deck, as investors are wary of the hype cycle.\nAnd, to those who turn to token sales, or the cringe-inducing \u201cICO,\u201d as a means to raise capital: such financing methods are nothing short of regulatory Russian Roulette. Just because regulatory action has not yet been taken doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be. Be diligent and follow best practices. This financing method shouldn\u2019t be forsaken, but it should be approached with the utmost caution (that I will dive into in a later op-ed). Notably, all advice and warnings laid out above still apply to ICOs.\nThis op-ed is a guest post by Jeremy Gardner.
