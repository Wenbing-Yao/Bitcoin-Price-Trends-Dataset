Consumers are looking for access to [improved] financial services, and Bitcoin offers them exactly that. Putting users in full control of their finances is the way this world should work. But what about the status of Bitcoin in Thailand, as there seems to be some confusion regarding that matter. Also read: Bank of America files patents for blockchain system Despite what the Wikipedia article might want people to believe, Bitcoin is not illegal in Thailand. Up until this point, many people assumed the popular digital currency has effectively been outlawed by the local government. However, those rumours have never been confirmed by an official party, leaving Bitcoin\u2019s status in Thailand in the \u201cgrey zone\u201d, so to speak. While Thailand is trying to figure out whether or not they want to regulate Bitcoin, the digital currency is thriving in the country. In fact, Thailand has two fully licensed Bitcoin exchanges in operation this very day, which says a lot about the leniency towards digital currency right now.Entering the financial market in Asia is not an easy feat, especially when the business model revolves around a currency not issued nor controlled by the local government. At the same time, not every Bitcoin company is successful in obtaining regulatory approval in Thailand either. Bitcoin Co. Ltd applied for a regulatory stamp of approval but was denied that label by Thai authorities. Back then, the Bank of Thailand deemed buying and selling of Bitcoin illegal, but only in the sense of \u201cwe don\u2019t have regulation or legislation covering it, therefore, do it at your own risk\u201d. It is important to distinguish between such a statement and effectively banning Bitcoin in Thailand. There is no point in attempting to ban a decentralized currency. At most, government officials and the Bank of Thailand can send a message to third-party payment processors to discourage them from working with Bitcoin-related companies. But that didn\u2019t happen either, as there are two regulatory-compliant Bitcoin exchanges active in the country right now. That being said, there are multiple Bitcoin exchange opportunities in Thailand. Not only is there Coins.co.th \u2013 which has been dubbed to be Thailand\u2019s leading Bitcoin wallet \u2013 but there is also bitcoin.co.th , Bx.in.th, and, of course, LocalBitcoins. Plenty of opportunities for consumers and businesses to buy and sell Bitcoin without too much hassle. Another option worth exploring is attending the Bitcoin Meetup in Bangkok, which takes place every Monday under the Bangkok Satoshi Square name. With close to 300 members and 119 Meetups under their belt already, this is one of the most active Bitcoin meetup groups in the world today.

Up until this point, most people and companies have been sparingly using QR codes to host additional information about events or movies. In the Bitcoin world, QR codes have been the norm for payments for quite some time now. The Dutch Payment Association Is looking into developing iDeal payments through QR codes. Also read: Bitcoin A Viable Option For Arcade City NYE Responsible Drivers Program Unlike what most companies in the FinTech sector are looking into, the Dutch Payment Association is taking a different approach to creating new ways of paying. No fancy new technology is needed to make payments more convenient, and QR codes present an interesting case for an experiment. iDeal Is one of the largest payment networks in The Netherlands, as it can be used for online purchases. However, consumers have been looking to use iDeal at brick-and-mortar locations, and the Dutch Payment Association wants to offer that functionality. Merchants will be able to generate QR codes during checkout, which consumers can then scan with a mobile device to complete the payment. The main goal of this integration is to make iDeal payments more convenient for customers using smartphones. Paying through QR codes seems to the future direction of iDeal as a company, and if all things go according to plan, the integration will be become a reality as early as next year. Most people will recognize the QR code because of its square shape filled with smaller cubes. Scanning such a QR code can be done through the built-in camera found in most mobile devices these days. Some users may need to install a separate barcode scanner application to get the process started, though. Embedded within every QR code is a dedicated payment URL for the consumer to visit once they have scanned the code itself. So far, it is unknown as to how many merchants have shown a genuine interest in this iDeal implementation, and when the exact launch will take place. . The introduction of QR codes in the payment industry is nothing new under the sun, although the trend is only now starting to catch on in Europe. Bitcoin users have been scanning QR codes for years, both for online and in-store purchases. Regardless of whether they are in the world, Bitcoin users can always scan one of these codes to complete a payment. It will be interesting to see when iDeal plans to launch their QR code integration for mass adoption, and whether or not consumers will take a liking to this approach. That being said it is positive to see the integration of QR codes for mainstream usage. Once consumers get used to this system, they might start to look at alternative payments offering the same functionality, such as Bitcoin.

One thing consumers can appreciate is an experience that does not involve too much hassle. At the same time, the faster they can buy and sell Bitcoin, the better. Whether or not Uphold will provide that service, remains to be seen, but the company has launched in China and will be accepted UnionPay for all purchases. Also read: Converting Bitcoin To Paypal Does Not Work Well For Obvious Reasons From a financial technology standpoint, any platform or service that can launch in China is a good thing. The country is well-known for being on the border of paranoid when it comes to financial services that are not originating from China itself. Uphold has a leg up over its competition in this regard, as they are among the first US FinTech companies to offer services in both Hong Kong and China. But that is not all, as Uphold also announced they will accept UnionPay as a payment method. For those among our readers who have no idea what UnionPay is, suffice it to say this is a US$7 trillion bank card market. Being able to tap into this market could open up a lot of opportunities for Uphold and the instant and free financial services and transactions they plan to offer to businesses and consumers alike. Considering how China is a booming market as far as online transactions are concerned, combined with the sheer number of mobile devices being used on an active basis, there is a huge financial market waiting to be explored. Uphold users can now use their Chinese UnionPay card to load funds into their wallets, and use it on the exchange platforms without any hassle. The most interesting part this launch has to do with Uphold Connect, an open API provided by the company to charities, individuals, and businesses. By using this API, new financial solutions and products can be created for customers all over the world. Plus, all of Uphold\u2019s accepted payment methods \u2013 including SEPA, Faster Payments and ACH \u2013 can be integrated into these new services as well. Uphold is an exchange platform where users can buy and sell a variety of assets, including precious metals, foreign currencies, and Bitcoin. Thanks to the integration of UnionPay, Chinese citizens can now quickly and conveniently buy and sell Bitcoin in exchange for one of the country\u2019s most commonly used payment methods. This will bring some interesting competition to the established Chinese Bitcoin exchanges as they have been dominating the trading volume for quite some time now. It will be interesting to see how much Bitcoin trading volume Uphold can generate over the coming months. Their launch in China and Hong Kong is definitely a step in the right direction.

Over the course of the past six years, Bitcoin has moved on from being a niche product to something that will change the world of finance forever. However, changing the public perception will be quite difficult, and take time to boot. Also read: ChangeTip kick-starts the Social Giving Challenge Even though more and more companies and individual start to see the benefits of Bitcoin and digital currency, there are still some key issues that need to be addressed in the near future. Despite the amazing technology powering the Bitcoin network, certain limitations may prevent the network from growing. Seven transactions per second, combined with half an hour of verification time to get some confirmations on every transaction, can be seen as major drawbacks in the eye of the public. Even though Bitcoin payment processors will work with zero-confirmation acceptance most of the time, speeding up network confirmations would give the digital currency a more legitimate appeal. Addressing the transaction limit is currently being done through the Bitcoin block size debate. Depending on which solution ends up being implemented by the Bitcoin developers, more transactions can take place per second, effectively competing with larger payment networks such as Visa and MasterCard. Bitcoin\u2019s colored past is not helping matters much either as far as public perception is concerned. Many people still associate Bitcoin with Mt. Gox, Silk Road, and other shady platforms that all played a role in the history of this digital currency. The fact that mainstream media likes to overdramatize these events, and hammer on them at every possible turn, is not helping matters much either. These problems transcend the consumer space, though, as businesses are hesitant to accept Bitcoin as well. Without a proper PR image, growth in the digital currency space will be difficult. Any service or product associated with the term Bitcoin is met with lukewarm reception business people and consumers right now. One notable trend to emerge throughout the year 2015 is how people have suddenly started to take a liking to the term blockchain. Keeping in mind how the blockchain is the foundation for every type of digital currency, it seems to be a preferable starting point when it comes to striking up a conversation about cryptocurrency in general. Fixing Bitcoin\u2019s public perception may very well come down to the usage of the term blockchain, rather than Bitcoin itself. Blockchain is the buzzword right now, which might eventually lead to people coming around to using the term Bitcoin as well. Only time will tell, but for now, blockchain is the proper terminology.

Especially in the mobile department, there seems to be a lot of competition going on to bring over as many consumers as possible to the world of Bitcoin. However, not all of these solutions are viable options, even though they might still be listed in the App Store. Hive Wallet, a once popular Bitcoin wallet, has not been maintained for over a year now. Also read: Converting Bitcoin To Paypal Does Not Work Well For Obvious Reasons Novice Bitcoin users on iOS do not have that many bitcoin wallet solutions at their disposal for the time being. This might come as quite a surprise, considering the ioS ecosystem is much easier regarding development, compared to Android. However, most consumers use an Android device, so it makes sense for developers and engineers to focus their attention on that market first. However, iOS users have to be careful as to which Bitcoin wallet they download. The two most obvious options are Hive Wallet and Breadwallet, both of which have received pretty good reviews so far. Unfortunately, the Hive Wallet Bitcoin wallet project is no longer being maintained by the developer, as it was abandoned over a year ago. Despite all of that, the software can still be downloaded from the App Store, which is causing a fair bit of confusion and controversy among Bitcoin community projects. A project that is no longer actively maintained should have been removed some time ago, yet for some reason, Hive Wallet can still be downloaded. Users who were to install this Bitcoin wallet software are at risk of losing their coins, which is not something anyone is looking forward to. Similar to how most hobby projects turn out for developers, funding can throw a monkey wrench into any future plans. In the case of Hive Wallet, the funding simply dried up after a while, and it was no longer financially viable to support the project any longer. Earlier this year, Hive Wallet founder Wendell Davis stated how operating capital was gone, and no one had maintained the project\u2019s source code for over a year. It is rather unfortunate to hear stories like these, but it\u2019s even more disconcerting to see Hive Wallet still listed in the Apple App Store. Surely someone has contacted Apple Support by now to let them know this project is no longer being maintained? Either way, iOS Bitcoin users are advised to look for alternatives, and Breadwallet seems to be a fan favorite for the time being.

An interesting observation about this weeks markets is the fact that 200k+ bitcoins were traded at the OKCoin exchange earlier today. OKCoin .cn has no trading fees, unlike the .com variant which has a 0.2% Taker Fee, for a list of bitcoin exchanges and comparison of fees check out this chart. Because of no trading fees, bots are able to trade with themselves causing spikes of volume.

Using this chart from XE, we can see today\u2019s CNY/USD crash Because most of the Bitcoin traders are in China, as the Yuan depreciates in value, many diversify their portfolio and invest in Bitcoins, as a result Bitcoin is feeling the bullish momentum of the investors. Hans from Tradingview suggests a Long position based on a technical indicator called a cup and handle. The cup and handle term is used to describe a stock which after rebounding and reaching old highs where many people bought, experiences selling pressure by the same investors. As a result, the stock tends to trade sideways for a few weeks. Here is a picture provided by Hans which shows the pattern: On another note, check out this chart as provided by austeritysucks.com regarding OKCoin futures and the fact that the biweekly contracts are trading at a discount: This graph and table shows the difference between the market price of OKCoin\u2019s three futures contracts: weekly, biweekly, and quarterlies. Currently the weekly and biweekly contracts are trading at a discount to the index price which it settles on. This is indicative of a bearish sentiment in the market, because a discount offers a pure arbitrage to individuals who can buy the futures at a discount and then sell at spot immediately. Bitcoin futures have a natural state of \u201cContango\u201d (http://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/contango_backwardation.asp) where the premiums on the contracts tend to be higher in the longer horizons. Thus many market participants perceive a discount to be bearish for sentiment, indicating that price may fall further. To see a historical view of how futures premiums are related to price action in the spot market see this chart from tradingview: When comparing quarterly premiums to price, as the premium starts to trend in a certain direction, the market may steer price toward a similar bullish or bearish sentiment on the longer timeframes. quarterlies premiums are now trending in a downward direction, coupled with a potential adam and eve double top.

Companies like Uber have set an interesting precedent for creating a new type of worker who can do their job based on an on-demand schedule. With New Year\u2019s Eve almost upon us, on-demand drivers would be of great value to society, considering how many people will get intoxicated over the next 36 hours. But not everyone sees it that way, especially not where Arcade City is concerned. Also read: Fixing The Public Perception of Bitcoin With The Blockchain Buzzword One thing that no one can deny about human nature is how so many people enjoy alcoholic beverages. Not that there is anything wrong with consuming alcohol, but when those same people might attempt to drive home themselves, chaos will ensue at some point. Some combinations have been tried and test, and they just don\u2019t work out, regardless of precautions or limited alcohol consumption. Luckily for all of us, there is a solution. Several people take it upon themselves every year to offer partygoers a free ride home, ensuring they arrive safely and do not cause any accidents while driving under the influence. At its core, solutions like these need to be applauded, as they address a key problem present in our society today. In this day and age, however, services like Uber have created an interesting paradigm. Anyone with a vehicle can offer rides to people and get paid a small amount to do so, without requiring an official cab license. Such an on-demand hailing service is something consumers all over the world enjoy, yet government officials are scratching their head as to how they should control the growth of these companies. In Portsmouth, New Hampshire, local officials are not too amused by the concept of offering an on-demand ride service, regardless of whether consumers pay for it or not. Christopher David, a Free State Project activist, living in Portsmouth, NH, wants to offer a tip-only ride service, which will be dubbed \u201cArcade City\u201d. It is important to note this service will only run throughout New Year\u2019s Eve. Considering how Mr. David is not explicitly charging customers for this service, he does not need official government permission [in his opinion]. However, local officials think otherwise, because accepting donations will be subject to a US$500 fine. It goes without saying the public safety of residents should the of the utmost priority, rather than whether or not they want to tip their driver. Unlike fiat currency, Bitcoin is not labelled as \u201cmoney\u201d in the state of New Hampshire. This means all of the drivers participating in Arcade City would \u2013 technically speaking \u2013 be allowed to accept Bitcoin donations for their trouble without facing any repercussions. Doing so could still result in a fine, however, as there is a public trade of the payment on the blockchain. At the same time, Bitcoin offers an interesting option for these on-demand services, as the digital currency is not controlled by legislators, government officials, or banks. Plus, transfers between two users take place in mere seconds, which would suit this \u201cbusiness model\u201d just fine. Government officials have known about Bitcoin for over six years now, and legislation is still playing catch-up.

Over the course of 2015, Bitcoin has been making some positive headlines all over the world, and with the number of monthly transactions still rising, now is an opportune time to get involved with digital currency payments. But what would it take to start accepting Bitcoin payments in a convenient way? Also read: ChangeTip kick-starts the Social Giving Challenge Convenience plays a major role when it comes to accepting Bitcoin payments for goods and services. One of the most common misconceptions regarding digital currency payments is how they can only be used online, which is not true. Peer-to-peer transfers of Bitcoin in person work just as well, assuming both parties are adequately prepared for the task at hand. Rather than setting up an account with a Bitcoin payment processor, businesses who deal with clients in person are better off setting up wallet application on their computer or smart device. Either solution will let the retailer generate Bitcoin \u201cinvoices\u201d and present them in the form of a QR code to their client. While there is a certain merit to having a Bitcoin payment processor account for generating invoices, it\u2019s not always the best solution when it comes to accepting payments in person. Granted, as long as there is a decent Internet connection present, using a payment processor is a valid option, but do keep in mind they will charge a small fee for converting Bitcoin to fiat currency [if that\u2019s your preference], One of the major selling points of Bitcoin is how the digital currency can work on a global scale, without any need for currency conversion within the Bitcoin ecosystem itself. This makes transferring money from one side of the world to the other a matter of mere minutes, rather than days or weeks. But this also creates an interesting opportunity for those among the Bitcoin community who frequently travel abroad. Bitcoin, as a currency, works in exactly the same way anywhere in the world. For retailers and businesses, this means that anyone in the world who owns Bitcoin can become a potential customer. Accepting payments through physical contact with potential customers plays an important role in that process, and the more convenient your solution is, the better for all parties involved. In the end, it all comes down to the point of whether or not a business needs to convert Bitcoin transactions to fiat currency on the fly. If Bitcoin transactions are less than five percent of your monthly revenue, there is no direct need to convert it into fiat currency by any means. However, the option will always be there when needed. Assuming Bitcoin transactions are a majority of monthly revenue, the scenario is quite different. Paying suppliers and other business partners in Bitcoin will \u2013 in most cases \u2013 not be possible, as they only accept fiat currency. For these businesses, immediately converting Bitcoin to fiat might be the better solution, making a payment processor account all but mandatory.

While any type of investment always carries a certain risk, Bitcoin presents some interesting arguments that one would not find in other investment opportunities. Also read: Community Efforts To Boost Bitcoin Education Investing in Bitcoin has everything to do with gambling on how the BTC price will evolve in the near and distant future. Volatility is an interesting creature, as it can lead to massive gains and losses based on it\u2019s actions. Bitcoin is one of the most volatile investments one can make, which opens up a lot of opportunities for interested parties. Over the past few months, there has been a major increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price. For those who invested in Bitcoin before that date, have probably made a very nice profit on their original deposit. At the same time, those who invested in Bitcoin during one of its peaks are impatiently waiting to break even or at the very least make a small profit. In a way, Bitcoin is far more exciting compared to stocks or other types of assets, as the market can be followed in real-time on a 24/7 basis. Furthermore, if one is not sastisfied with Bitcoin\u2019s volatility as is and wants to take it up a notch, check out this chart for a list of exchanges that support margin trading. You can set your leverage so that a very slight price movement is reflected as 3x 5x or even 10x the amount. Part of this volatility can be attributed to Bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. In yesterday\u2019s article, we mentioned how some people feel inflation in Bitcoin would be a good thing. But in truth, there is no need for inflation, as that wouldn\u2019t make Bitcoin any better than fiat currency or central banks. 21 Million BTC creates plenty of chances for investing in Bitcoin. The hype surrounding Bitcoin has not gone by unnoticed, as more and more merchants are starting to accept digital currency payments. Booking flights and hotels, buying video games, or getting a new Windows license, can all be paid in Bitcoin these days. Those who began investing in Bitcoin in the early days are paying all of these expenses with profits they made throughout the years. One interesting factor to keep in mind is how governments all over the world are slowly warming up to Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology. During the early days of digital currency, governments rejected the idea of Bitcoin altogether, but now that regulatory frameworks are being created, the overall tone seems cautiously positive in most cases. Last but not least, Bitcoin gives investors an excellent opportunity to diversify their portfolio, without running into any bank restrictions. Investing in Bitcoin means the end user is in full control of their funds at any given time, rather than trusting a third party to keep it safe. This is something entirely different compared to what investors are used to, and most of them have taken a liking to it.

This is a clear example as to how some people don\u2019t get the concept of Bitcoin to begin with, as digital currency is non-refundable, whereas PayPal is subject to fraud and chargebacks. Plus, PayPal\u2019s Terms of Service does not cover the sale of digital goods, which is \u2013 technically speaking \u2013 illegal. Also read: Ledger Nano Hardware Wallet Review and Unboxing In a way, it makes sense for consumers to convert Bitcoin to and from convenient online payment methods, such as PayPal. The reason for this demand is simple: far more merchants and retailers accept PayPal payments, whereas Bitcoin adoption is still in its very early stages. However, it is important to note that PayPal and Bitcoin operate on two entirely different protocols. PayPal, while very convenient, uses traditional payment methods to let consumers send money all over the world by just using an email address. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not use credit cards or bank accounts to move money around the world, as Bitcoin is its own currency. Third-party services providers such as PayPal are in a completely different league compared to Bitcoin. In fact, Bitcoin and PayPal can\u2019t even be compared to one another, as they are vastly different in nearly every aspect. As a result, converting one to the other can be a pain in the rear as there is a good reason for that. Plenty of users have been converting Bitcoin to PayPal funds in the past, and nearly every single transaction has lead to a chargeback by the PayPal, account owner. This is what happens when using credit cards or bank accounts, combined with a third-party service that does not offer any seller protection on digital items. Whenever somebody issues a PayPal chargeback after buying Bitcoin, they will be given the money back within a certain period of time. As a Bitcoin seller, this puts one in a very awkward position, as they have lost the BTC \u2013 which are non-refundable \u2013 as well as that fiat currency due to the chargeback. Hence, hardly anyone wants to use PayPal in conjunction with Bitcoin, for obvious reasons. That being said, there are some options to convert Bitcoin to PayPal, if that is the only option for you. BitWala recently launched a service to convert BTC to PP funds, although they will take a small cut for doing so.

Currently bitcoin is trading at $422, after breaking the $420 resistance line and turning it into a support zone. After this past weekend\u2019s panic it seems that once again volume has died down, traders are cautiously waiting on the sidelines for the next whale to dump some btc or the next investor to buy up some coin. Don\u2019t get too exited yet, while it may seem like we have tested the $420 support, the volume has been so low that the next move will really determine whether we head north or south. Fanatik_ from tradingview suggests to play safe with a short positiong and watch for the $425 support. On the upside, BenoitMilnerGroup from tradingview suggests to play a long position. If you look at the 4 month long chart you can see a clear bullish trend. Furthermore, it is no secret that Bitfinex continuously has more open long vs short order. Using BTC_Markets\u2019 comment history we compiled a chart showing this past week\u2019s long vs short order distribution for bitfinex: Using basic technical analysis indicators BenoitMilnerGroup provided the following chart: He provided 3 reasons as to why Bitcoin\u2019s price will exhibit the above movement. Firstly, because btc continuously has had more long positions, it is an indicator that the bullish momentum is present. The second reason is because of Boxing Day which was celebrated on Saturday, December 26th. It is a holiday where employees receive gifts called \u201cChristmas Box\u201d from their bosses. BenoitMilnerGroup suggested that due to Christmas and Boxing day bitcoin saw a decrease of transactions, signaling \u201clack of use\u201d. Furthermore, many traders closed their positions in order to reenter next year, China lead the dumps as CNY markets dropped lower than USD. Last but not least, Bitcoin is booming in Africa and Asia and is considered a safe haven as an alternative investment, BenoitMilnerGroup writes: An interesting observation about the latest price is how closely the main exchanges are synced. BTC-E and Bitstamp never agree on the price as BTC-E\u2019s price is always considerably lower than the other major exchanges. Since China led the Boxing Day dumps, we can conclude that Bitstamp and Bitfinex felt the dumps as they have a much higher Chinese trading population and because they are easier to arbitrage. On the other hand, BTC-E\u2019s market didn\u2019t feel the Chinese dumps as much and stayed above water.

Either type of effort will heavily rely on community participation as we can\u2019t expect industry experts to do all of the hard work. It is positive to see bitcoin community members take it upon themselves to engage others in meaningful discussions regarding digital currency. Also read: Bitcoin Expectations For 2016 \u2013 Price, Education, And Awareness Educating the masses on Bitcoin and digital currency is not a task that should be taken lightly. There are many consumers around the world who have no [clear] understanding of what bitcoin is, or how it is being used by others. Negative media attention on Bitcoin is not helping matters much either, unfortunately. Enabling people to ask you any and all questions about Bitcoin is a major step in the right direction. Some people might argue that all of the Bitcoin information can be accessed online, and that is certainly true. But at the same time, digital currency is all about peer-to-peer interaction, and human interaction is a key element. Rest assured, one will be answering the same types of questions on a regular basis. Explaining the why and how of Bitcoin will take up most of an evangelist\u2019s time, as there are a lot of questions that need to be answered properly. However, there is no standard answer to these questions as every consumer has their needs and preferences to take into account. This is why it is important to engage in an open conversation with others as part of Bitcoin education efforts and get to know them a bit. Based on that information, the explanation on Bitcoin and other digital currencies will change from person to person. Sharing knowledge is a patient process, and standardized answers have no place when it comes to Bitcoin. Becoming a mentor or evangelist in the Bitcoin education sector can be done in a variety of ways. Running a website with a contact form, engaging in Reddit conversations, or even approaching people on your own accord, are all valid options. Find what works best for you, and try to spread the word on Bitcoin to as many people as people. There is no denying most people will have heard of Bitcoin due to its colored past. Silk Road is something nearly everyone in the world has heard of by now, and its association with Bitcoin puts the digital currency in a negative spotlight. However, this was also an important part of Bitcoin history, as things have come a long way ever since. Going on the defensive when educating people on Bitcoin is not the best practice. There is no need to shy away from events that transpired over the past six years of Bitcoin history, as we all learned valuable lessons along the way. Be patient, answer questions, and engage in meaningful conversations with your audience.

There are quite a few different Bitcoin Core contributors, but the overall decision-making seems to revolve around ideas by the same few individuals. Ever since Bitcoin XT started rearing its head, the community has been divided into a few camps. Also read: Credit Card Payment Protocol Unsafe \u2013 Bitcoin is A Global Solution Some people fail to realize there is no mandatory choice when it comes to running Bitcoin software on one\u2019s devices. Regardless of whether you run Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin XT, Armory, or any other wallet available to you, you will always be a part of the Bitcoin network itself. After all, the Bitcoin source code is publicly available for anyone to see and play around with. That being said, when it comes to making effective changes to Bitcoin as a protocol, the options become more limited. Right now, the main development takes places under the Bitcoin Core banner, although depending on how the block size debate will turn out, Bitcoin XT could be a worthy contender. It is funny that people flock to Bitcoin because they have choices, alternatives, and open source tools at their disposal, yet it is not seen as decentralization. There are many facets to decentralizing a currency like Bitcoin, and the software wallets are just the tip of the iceberg. Different solutions provide different ideas, which can only lead to further innovation. Decentralizing Bitcoin development is already here, and it has been for quite some time now. Developers from all over the world can contribute to the future of the Bitcoin protocol, and make their suggestions publicly available on GitHub. It doesn\u2019t get more decentralized than that in the world of software, that much is certain. However, Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin XT developers have to put in certain safeguards as well. The recent Bitcoin block size debate pointed out a very critical issue in the Bitcoin infrastructure: scalability. True to its decentralized nature, various proposals and ideas were brought to the table and it is now up to the community to decide which solution will work best. Different options create different trains of thoughts and projections for the future. Some people are pro-Bitcoin Core, others are pro-Bitcoin XT, and yet others don\u2019t like either solution all that much. It is impossible to please everyone, and every possible solution raises questions that need to be answered promptly. Other than the block size debate, there are some other issues that will need to be addressed by Bitcoin developers in the near future. A lot of community members are wondering where the allegiance of Bitcoin Core developers lies exactly as rumors about creating a centralized enforced fee structure keep rearing their ugly heads. Additionally, there is the discussion of Bitcoin XT becoming an altcoin instead of a different set of features compared to Bitcoin Core. Granted, Bitcoin XT would require a hard fork of the blockchain, which technically makes it a different digital currency. Reaching a consensus on the block size debate needs to happen very soon, or the Bitcoin community will continue to destroy itself from within.

Depending on who you ask, that questions will be answered with either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201chell no\u201d. In the case of Forbes, a nice top ten list has been published as to why one should not invest in Bitcoin. When people need to tell you why you shouldn\u2019t invest in something in more than five words, the question becomes whether or not you should believe them. Also read: The State of Decentralization In The Bitcoin Space One of the main criticisms people have against Bitcoin is the fixed supply cap. While 21 million BTC is plenty to go around \u2013 because it is divisible to eight points after the decimal \u2013 there have been rumours regarding possibly increasing the cap at some point. There is no need to create inflation in the Bitcoin world, as there are plenty of coins for everyone in the world. No one ever said every person in the world should own one full bitcoin to begin with. A strange theory suggests that introducing inflation into the Bitcoin ecosystem could possibly make sense once mining digital currency becomes so expensive compared to the reward that miners will stop supporting the network altogether. Technically speaking, this could happen once all of the bitcoins are mined, which will take a few more decades. Or, if the Bitcoin price falls dramatically, some miners might rethink their position as well. Regardless of whether one agrees with regulation or not, the lack of guidelines around the world can be seen as a hamper on Bitcoin growth. As long as digital currency remains in a \u201cgrey area\u201d it will be difficult to gain the trust of consumers and merchants in most of the countries. Proper guidelines could give Bitcoin a more legitimate appeal in the long run, but only if those guidelines do not constrict growth like BitLicense is doing. But the biggest reason Bitcoin might not be a good investment is because some people will buy Bitcoin, and see the price decline shortly after. Consumers have to keep in mind that obtaining Bitcoin from an investment point of view is a certain risk, just like trading assets, bonds, or anything else issued by the government or bank is. The only difference is that Bitcoin is far more transparent as to which countries are buying and selling Bitcoin, and peer-to-peer trades are among the possibility. Once someone gets burned by a less fortunate Bitcoin investment, word of mouth spreads the message faster than anything else. Then again, that is a personal risk somebody took, and Bitcoin is not at fault for that. In the end, it all comes down to this: do you really need someone to hold your hand every step along the way when it comes to making an investment? Then, by all means, invest in something the bank suggests to you, and see how that turns out in the end. Don\u2019t blame the product or service you invest in, as no one is telling you to invest in the first place. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable to invest in Bitcoin, then please don\u2019t even start. Any type of investment carries a risk, and Bitcoin is no exception to that. In fact, Bitcoin is never a guaranteed profit, less, or return. Never invest any money you can\u2019t afford to lose. But if you don\u2019t make an investment, don\u2019t come crying afterwards about the money you missed out on either.

Also read: Shorter Bitcoin Block Time Due To Hashrate Spike Is No Reason For Concern Depending on how one looks at Bitcoin, having expectations in the world of digital currency might not be the best option to choose from. Bitcoin is very unpredictable as an industry, as well as in the price per BTC. Even companies active in this space can throw a curveball to customers every now and then. But there are some certainties in the Bitcoin world as well. Blockchain technology will keep attracting new startups and established financial institutions for many years to come. One does not expect blockchain technology to change the world overnight, as this process will take a few years at last. Additionally, VC funds will keep flowing to Bitcoin and blockchain companies for the foreseeable future, although the numbers might be different compared to 2015. After setting a record year regarding funding and investment, 2016 will be a \u201cput up or shut up\u201d year for a fair few companies. Depending on how that scenario plays out, there will be more, less, or nearly the same of money flowing to digital currencies in 2016. Regarding the Bitcoin price, the block halving \u2013 which takes place around April of 2016 \u2013 is a moment of great importance to enthusiasts and investors. Many people feel this halving will lead to a major Bitcoin price boost although it remains to be seen whether or not that will be the case. Good things won\u2019t come to the Bitcoin world unless the community members make things happen. Sitting back idly and watching how the situation unfolds will not lead to any increase in Bitcoin adoption, neither by merchants or consumers.

Especially where credit cards are concerned, there is still a lot of work to be done to even create an illusion of security. German researchers recently exposed a major flaw in the concept of the plastic card payment protocol, allowing hackers to steal any information. Also read: Bitcoin HYIP Ponzi Scheme Alert \u2013 CoinDouble Credit cards themselves are not that secure either, but the recent introduction of EMV chips is making it a lot harder for assailants to get any useful information from the user. But by the look of things, the real threat is not the plastic card itself, but rather the protocol used to process those payments. Based on the recent findings by two German code-breakers, the real threat comes from the payment protocol itself. While most of these security flaws can be fixed with a software update, deep-rooted issues are a different story altogether. Assailants are, on paper, capable of stealing all of the information attached to the card itself. Addressing security flaws at the protocol level is not as easy as releasing software fix, unfortunately. To put these issues to bed, the entire card payment protocol would have to be overhauled. As a direct result, the use of payment terminals would become impossible all over the world, bringing card transactions to a complete stop on a global scale. German Code-breaker Karsten Nohl stated: In a worst case scenario, the protocol flaws can be used against shops and retailers as well. Assailants could charge their accounts for refunds that never even took place, which would put many companies out of business pretty fast. For the consumer, card information can be cloned, making it easy to empty one\u2019s account as assailants would even have access to the PIN code itself. Many consumers all over the world have been complaining about their credit card details being stolen. Now that we know the payment protocol is as insecure as it can be, the question becomes whether or not people wills tart looking for alternative payment methods such as Bitcoin. Unlike traditional payment protocols, the Bitcoin network is far more secure and protected from financial harm. All transactions have to be signed with a private key, which is solely owned by the end user. At the same time, all of the transaction details are publicly available, yet contain no personal information.

Ever since that website shut down, multiple other HYIP and other investment schemes have popped up, all in an effort to defraud unsuspecting customers. CoinDouble is the latest Ponzi to join this growing list, and they use the same theme and style as CryptoDouble did: Also read: ROKOS Is A Free Raspberry Pi Operating System To Launch A Bitcoin Node Whenever a new form of payment comes up, it is only a matter of time until people with less than honest intentions check it out. In the world of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, Ponzi and HYIP schemes seem to be the weapon of attack for the time being, as they lure in unsuspecting users with impossible promises. As the name CoinDouble suggests, the goal of this Ponzi scheme is fairly simple: users deposit a certain amount of Bitcoin, and the site operator will double your money within the next 100 hours. Every hour, a transaction worth 2% of the original investment will be sent to the investor\u2019s Bitcoin address, which means one can break even after fifty hours. Don\u2019t be mistaken in thinking this website is making any form of money through investments or trading coins on behalf of the investors. A Ponzi scheme such as CoinDouble remains in operation as long as deposits from other users keep coming in. Once this fund starts to dry up, no further payouts will take place although they will still be listed on the website. Even though the CoinDouble main page will display a lot of new deposits and payouts being made to certain Bitcoin addresses, rest assured a lot of these transactions are fake. There is no way to verify whether or not a certain Bitcoin transaction on the network was sent to or from the Coindouble owner, as there are no transaction messages included. Looking up any of the transactions listed on the CoinDouble main page will clearly show these are just random transactions pulled from the blockchain. Even addresses who should have received multiple payouts already will show no more than a handful of transactions that vaguely resemble payout amounts coming from CoinDouble. Another factor indicating how illegitimate this platform is, comes in the form of no information about the site owner or company behind CoinDouble. All of the registrar information is protected by WHOISGUARD, which is usually not a positive sign. After all, if this were a legitimate business, contact information would be accessible to everyone. Ponzi schemes will not go away anytime soon, and Bitcoin users need to steer clear from sites like CoinDouble at all costs.

For those who are not yet aware, full bitcoin nodes enforce the rules of the bitcoin network. They do this by serving full copies of the blockchain, but also by validating transactions and blocks. Unfortunately, in the last couple of months, these have been declining, thus leading the bitcoin network towards centralisation. In fact, the network has seen a large decrease of around 19% in viable bitcoin nodes last year. The main reason why nodes may be disappearing is that while bitcoin miners are rewarded with bitcoin for generating countless transaction confirmations, those running nodes are not given anything in return, regardless of hosting the entire blockchain database and relaying all transactions. BTCC\u2019s Samson Mow made a press statement, saying that the company decided to deploy these nodes so that it would fulfil its role in maintaining the bitcoin. He also mentioned that \u201cAs a proponent and believer in bitcoin, we see both supporting core development and well as the bitcoin network itself as our duty. The nodes we deployed today will help to preserve the network as the number of full bitcoin nodes continues to decrease.\u201d Together with this, it\u2019s also worth pointing out that the bitcoin exchange has deployed a total of 10 powerful DNS seed nodes, coming with unrestricted network access. Based on this, anyone who would like to host their own bitcoin core nodes can also use these, as they\u2019re publicly available. Most of the nodes deployed by BTCC are in China (21%), Germany (19%) and Singapore (19%). However, most of the firm\u2019s reachable full bitcoin nodes are in the US, with the rest donated in countries ranking low on the full bitcoin node geographic distribution chart. The company is also currently encouraging other major bitcoin companies to join them in contributing to the bitcoin system, which can easily be done by sponsoring a couple of powerful, full nodes.Do keep in mind that when companies pick up the slack, the phenomenon leads to centralization, which is why more individuals should also consider sponsoring nodes.

Part of this growth can be attributed to the new BitFury data center in Georgia, which makes use of the country\u2019s cheaper energy solutions to bring additional mining hardware online. Some people are worried about the number of network blocks being generated right now, but there is no real reason to worry just yet. Also read: Bitcoin HYIP Ponzi Scheme Alert \u2013 CoinDouble When hardware mining manufacturers deploy their own machines on a large scale a major upwards bump regarding overall Bitcoin hash power is to be expected. That being said, a near 50% hashpower increase in just a few days is not something that happens every day and it has some community members worried. According to a Reddit post, the new BitFury mining chip is the culprit in this scenario, due to its increased efficiency and overall mining power. If push would come to shove, BitFury, might be in line for a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network, assuming they use their own centralized mining pool to do all of the hard work. One thing people tend to forget is mining hardware manufacturers are well aware of these potential issues, and will do everything they can to prevent a 51% attack. However, there is one worrying statistic, which puts the current Bitcoin block time at slightly over five minutes on average. In a normal scenario, blocks are found roughly every ten minutes, but now, things are happening at an accelerated pace. Granted, the Bitcoin difficulty will need to adjust, which only happens once every 2,160 blocks. So far, there does not seem to be a reason to panic just yet, as there are questions regarding how the total hashrate on the Bitcoin network is generated. Statistics on Blockchain.info show a spike getting close to 975 Petahash while the current network speed sits at roughly 765 Petahash. Even though this latter number is still fairly high, it\u2019s not as dramatic as the statistics indicate. Additionally, the same mining pools as before are founding the Bitcoin blocks, even though this is taking place at an accelerated pace. There is no mystery pool popping up \u201cstealing\u201d all of the blocks from other Bitcoin miners, making the 51% attack threat non-existent. O the other hand, these types of warnings are a positive trend, as they will let the entire bitcoin community know something big is happening. Once the Bitcoin mining difficulty adjusts again \u2013 which will take place somewhere in the next 96 hours \u2013 the true effect of this increased hashpower on the network will become visible. Miners should brace themselves for a major difficulty increase, though, as finding Bitcoins on the network will become even more difficult than it was before.

Depending on the amount of money one wants to convert, there might be some identity verification in place, such as scanning one\u2019s ID or driver\u2019s license. But one Bitcoin ATM in Australia is not behaving properly, as it recently swallowed a user\u2019s fiat currency without paying out bitcoins. Also read: Bitcoin Would Have Prevented Hyatt Hotels Credit Card Information Theft Having so many Bitcoin ATMs installed all over the world should be cause for celebration, but in some cases, unforeseen events may transpire. The Bitcoin ATM located next to the Pitt Street Mall in Sydney, Australia, should be avoided at all costs for the time being, as the device is not operating properly. A report has surfaced on Reddit from a user who tried to exchange AUD$100 for bitcoins through the ATM, which never paid out digital currency. Said user mentions how a brief error message appeared on the Bitcoin ATM screen, which then disappeared. All of this took place after the user had inserted the fiat currency into the designated slot. Software issues can happen at any given time, and the user tried to contact the operator of the Bitcoin ATM, which was believed to be BitRocket. However, as it turns out, this machine is not operated by BitRocket, but by ABA, an Australian company specializing in Bitcoin ATMs. At the time of publication, it remained unclear as to what had exactly happened with the Bitcoin ATM. The user who tried to convert fiat had not received a response from ABA yet, although rectifying the issue should not be much of a problem. With the holiday season in full effect, it might take a while until this matter is resolved, though. When events like these transpire, there is very little the end user can do about the issue. Most Bitcoin ATM operators have their contact information listed somewhere near the device itself, making it easy to get in touch with them. Or that should be the case at last as very few of these companies invest in customer support. Getting in touch with the Bitcoin ATM operator is the only way forward to resolving these types of issues. Playing the waiting game is never fun, especially not when there is money involved. We can only hope ABA gets the issue sorted as soon as possible, returns the customer\u2019s money \u2013 either in fiat or BTC \u2013 and get the ATM operational again.

More and more consumers have access to mobile devices, and it only makes sense to use this medium as a way to buy and sell things. Twitter partnered with Lookup to let Indian consumers buy items in 140 characters or less. Also read: Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology Can Be Beneficial To Apple PayM-Commerce To Take Off Through Twitter? Developing countries, such as India, are gambling on m-commerce. The reason for that is quite simple: hardly anyone has access to their own computer, yet smartphones are widespread and easily accessible for just about anyone. In fact, most Indians use their smartphone for anything productivity or shopping related already. Local retailers have taken notice of this trend and are developing mobile applications to provide an optimal user experience. At the same time, there are some retailers who offer special discounts when placing orders on a mobile device, only adding to the m-commerce trend in the country. That level of success has not gone by unnoticed, as none other than Twitter wants to get their piece of the pie. By partnering with Lookup, a chat application connecting retailers with consumers, Indians can now make mobile purchases by using social media. Even retailers who are not invested in an online presence just yet can make use of Lookup to accept mobile orders. It is important to keep in mind Twitter will only act as a communication tool, and orders and payments are not handled by them at any time. However, the company\u2019s API makes it easier for Lookup to connect retailers and consumers. Plus, Twitter has various monitoring options to find new partners who want to make use of the services provided by Lookup. For Twitter itself, this move could give the company some much-needed exposure in the India market. At the time of publication, less than one in five social network users in India uses Twitter, which is quite a surprise. Projecting this number across the entire country\u2019s population, and less than two percent of the people are using Twitter. Even though Twitter is a major partner for Lookup, the Indian company is well aware this partnership might not be the most successful one in the long run. Lookup CEO Deepak Ravindran stated how the company is keeping all other options open as well, which could hint at alternative payment methods down the line. Considering the lack of financial services for most people in India, Bitcoin acceptance could be an interesting avenue to explore for Lookup. As Bitcoin is cheap, accessible, and not controlled by central banks, a lot of people started using the digital currency in recent years. For emerging markets, such as India, Bitcoin and m-commerce could be a golden combination.

In that article, Daniel Masters, co-founder of Jersey-based Global Advisors\u2019 multi-million dollar bitcoin hedge fund compared Bitcoin\u2019s reward halving to an oil company announcing that oil production is going to be cut in half in a few months. The oil market would react with a substantial price hike, Masters further suggests that the halving hasn\u2019t yet been counted into the bitcoin price because the market is in it\u2019s infancy. That suggests that Bitcoin may see new highs in 2016. If Bitcoin does indeed reach new highs then that would mean that the so called bubble of 2014 wasn\u2019t really a bubble and that is when Bitcoin may see the moon with prices soaring in the thousands. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $455, after testing support at $440 the market is ready to retest $460. Looking on tradingview, it seems that most traders are bearish. Cryptogamblr from tradingview showed a support and resistance band and pointed out that a 2 year S&R band is hard to break, further suggesting that $460 is going to serve as resistance once more before the anticipated bubble around Spring of 2016. source: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/B1vO45Yh-BTC-1W-view-of-massive-S-R-band/ On the upside, afbitcoins from tradingview mapped a modified schiff fork \u2013 a technical indicator that uses three parallel trendlines to identify possible levels of support and resistance \u2013 to show that the support and resistance levels seem to be obeying these lines very well. afbitcoins writes: Greencheckmark on r/BitcoinMarkets pointed out that because of a 8,000 BTC increase in shorts on bitfinex, the price is destined to do something within 24 hours.

It should come as no surprise this warning had an adverse effect, as Bitcoin adoption is growing in the country. When it comes to cheap international money transfers to and from Kenya, there is no better option than using Bitcoin. Also read: Will Kenya Be The Next Bitcoin Hub? Even though the Central Bank of Kenya might not like Bitcoin or any other digital currency, there is very little they can do about the growing rate of its adoption in the country. Tight capital controls make it hard for Kenyans to move money to and from the country unless they use expensive remittance solutions. To make matters even more interesting, the Central Bank of Kenya deemed Bitcoin not to be legal tender in the country, technically making it illegal to use. However, at the same time, there is no official ban on the usage of digital currencies, leaving Bitcoin in a grey zone. With no government or bank guarantee to protect Bitcoin from financial harm, consumers are well warned about the risks digital currency holds. These warnings are not swaying the minds of Kenyan citizens, though, as they flock to Bitcoin like never before. According to statistics mentioned by Fulton News, roughly 10,000 people in Kenya are using Bitcoin right now, and that number will keep on growing for quite some time. As far as the reasoning goes behind these numbers, Bitcoin is a far cheaper and convenient way to send and receive remittance transfers. With low costs, and transactions clearing within seconds, transferring wealth from one place to the next is a breeze. Additionally, all a user needs is a mobile device to receive Bitcoin payments, of which there are plenty in developing countries like Kenya. Furthermore, Kenyans have easy access to Bitcoin, thanks to services like M-Pesa and BitPesa. Even though the former business is currently blocked by Kenya\u2019s largest mobile network operator, it is only a matter of time until they will be servicing customers once again. Even though the Central Bank of Kenya might not like Bitcoin all that much, the underlying blockchain technology could be of great value to them. In fact, quite a few major banks around the world have shown an interest in blockchain technology to help revitalize their infrastructure. Not embracing this revolutionary technology would be a major mistake on the Central Bank of Kenya\u2019s part. Faster and cheaper money transfers within the country itself are beneficial to all parties involved, and could help attract new investors from abroad. Regardless of their decision, Bitcoin and blockchain technology are not going anywhere anytime soon.

The most recent malware infection was found on payment terminals owned by Hyatt Hotels, and visitors are advised to keep a close eye on their credit card statements over the next few months. Bitcoin easily could have prevented all this, but some people will only learn this lesson the hard way. Also read: Bitcoin Could Be The Golden Ticket To Make M-Commerce Take Off Being a major player in the hotel industry is all the more reason to ensure all of your payment security is up-to-date. Hyatt Hotels will be keeping a close eye on their payment terminals from now on, even though the damage has already been done. No information has been released as to how much data has been stolen due to this malware infection. Payment terminals are an easy target for malware attacks, as it would be the last place anyone would look. To most people, including hotel staff, a payment terminal is a stand=alone device that poses no real threat unless somebody decided to skim credit cards. Nothing could be further from the truth, unfortunately, as these terminals operate on software, and are connected to the Internet [or a computer that is connected to the Internet]. Once such a payment terminal becomes infected with malware, all hell breaks loose. For Hyatt Hotels customers, this means credit card details have most likely been stolen, including the number, verification code, and expiry date. In some cases, the four-digit PIN code may have been breached as well, allowing hackers to empty customer\u2019s cards by cloning the plastic payment method. Hyatt Hotels recently discovered the malware installed on computers managing the payment terminals. According to a recent Reuters article, the malware had been detected on November 30, but no details were given as to how long the payment terminals had been infected for, nor how many customers have been possibly affected. It is not the first time major hotel chains report issued with stolen credit card information due to malware attacks. Earlier this year, Hilton, Trump, and Starwood issued similar warnings, all of which were a direct result of payment terminals being affected. All of these chains have to start taking payment security more seriously or switch to alternate payment options like Bitcoin. Unlike credit cards, Bitcoin is not subject to malware attacks or user details being stolen. As a payment protocol, Bitcoin is far more secure than credit cards will ever be, as the end user is in full control of the vital piece of information that allows funds to be spent: their private key. With credit cards, all of the details are on the card itself, making it easier to steal details. It only makes sense for retailers and brands to start accepting Bitcoin payments sooner or later. Bitcoin is a global currency, meaning anyone in the world can freely use it without worrying about exchange rates. Plus, the transaction costs are far lower, making it quite beneficial to the recipient as well.

Up until now, the only options were to either use a [previous] computer or laptop, or buy one of the pre-configured \u2013 but rather expensive \u2013 Bitcoin Node solutions running on a Raspberry Pi. ROKOS v4 might be the solution some people have been looking for, as it will turn any Raspberry Pi into a Bitcoin or altcoin node. Also read: One Australian Bitcoin ATM Is Not Dispensing BTC Properly Note from the Author: Neither the Author nor TheMerkle.com is responsible for any harm coming to your device or wallet balances as a result of installing this software. Always install new types of software at your own risk. Most Bitcoin community members feel the current plug-and-play Bitcoin Node solutions are far too expensive. Keeping in mind how nearly all of these devices use a cheap Raspberry Pi and some additional storage, the question becomes why these solutions need to cost more than US$100. Surely there must be some alternative solutions available for more tech-savvy people who want to use their Raspberry Pi for the greater good of the Bitcoin network? Various developers and engineers have been thinking along the same lines, and ROKOS v4 is an interesting candidate. The operating system itself is based on Raspbian \u2013 a popular Linux version for Raspberry Pi users \u2013 and comes pre-packaged with integrated Bitcoin OK clients and Node software ready to be used. It is no secret the Raspberry Pi is a quite powerful device, despite it small form factor. For regular desktop applications, the first generation of devices might be a bit lackluster in performance, but the second generation packs an even bigger punch. ROKOS v4 specifically aimed at Raspberry Pi 2 owners, although it may work with the first generation of devices as well. The two main supported applications of ROKOS v4 are either running a full Bitcoin Node or using it as an OKCash staking device. For those of you who are unfamiliar with OKCash, this is an alternative digital currency based on the Bitcoin source code, but with a few twists and turns. Make sure to check out the OKCash thread on Bitcointalk for more information. What makes this free solution so interesting is how it comes pre-loaded with Bitcoin and OKCash clients, which should create a smoother out-of-the-box experience for users. Some synchronization for both clients might be needed during the initial startup, so make sure your Raspberry Pi has some external storage on board more than 50GB. This will not be the final version of the ROKOS operating system, though, as the developers have listed some improvements that will be introduced in future versions. Support for additional digital currencies, blockchain updates, and security updates are just a few of the things that will be coming to ROKOS v5 and beyond.

There are different wallets for different platforms and each have their strengths and weaknesses. The charts below highlight the most popular bitcoin wallets available on the market. We compare their features such as platforms supported, whether it is open source, where are the private keys stored, and the type of wallet that it is. Up first is the Electrum Bitcoin Wallet for your desktop. It comes in first because it is the most versatile desktop wallet available. It has a developers console which enables full control over your coins. You are able to generate custom transactions from files, and able to create watch only addresses to keep your cold storage funds safe. Not only that, but Electrum provides an easy to use interface for funding wallets. Breadwallet is our highest ranked iOS wallet available. If you are an iPhone user and need your bitcoins on the go, you can\u2019t go wrong with Breadwallet. The keys are stored on your phone and upon the first installation you are provided with a recovery seed which you can use to recover your bitcoins in case the phone gets stolen or accidentally erased. Furthermore, Breadwallet is a HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) Wallet meaning that with the seed you are able to recover all of your addresses and labels. Checkout this full breadwallet bitcoin wallet review. Airbitz is a relatively new Bitcoin wallet launched in 2015, it\u2019s unique architecture along with an exceptional user experience distinguishes it from it\u2019s competitors. Airbitz does not require any personal information to start using the app and automated backups ensure your funds remain safe. While only available to Android and iOS users, Airbitz is both open source and has recently released an SDK which means anybody can port the wallet to a platform of their choice. Make sure to give the Airbitz app a try either on Android or iOS as there are many more features which have gone unmentioned, checkout the full Airbitz bitcoin wallet review here. Multibit HD is another great light desktop wallet. It offers almost identical features that Electrum provides. However, Multibit does not support multisig wallets. On the other hand, Multibit also offers seamless support with Trezor, a bitcoin hardware wallet. The GUI on electrum and multibit is a bit different. If you need more complex features like being able to rebroadcast a transaction, exporting private keys of certain addresses then Electrum is the way to go. But for a personal user, Multibit is a great alternative. In fifth place the Mycelium Android Wallet is a great wallet available for Android users. Just like Breadwallet the keys are stored on your phone meaning there are no servers to hack. It features a robust marketplace where you can find local bitcoin buyers and sellers and check out their prices. Furthermore, Mycelium awards extra security with the implementation of watch only addresses. Checkout this full mycelium wallet review for a more in detail overview. In sixth place comes the Blockchain Bitcoin Wallet, it has both an android and an iOS app with the addition of a website. Unfortunately the keys are stored online meaning that if the site goes down access to the coins is lost. On the bright side, blockchain allows you to export the private keys of any of your addresses meaning that you can have access to the coins even if the site goes down. The cross platform compatibility and the ability to gain full control over your bitcoins ranks Blockchain as the top online wallet. Checkout the full blockchain.info review here. In seventh place we have Jaxx wallet. It is a relatively new wallet launch last year, but it is one of the most popular multi currency wallets out there. As you might have figured by now, what sets Jaxx wallet apart is the fact that they support more than just Bitcoin. Ethereum, Dash, and Litecoin are just a few examples of supported cryptocurrencies. While the Jaxx website does list the source code for the wallet, since we couldn\u2019t find a complete github of the wallet we do not consider it open source. Jaxx claims that they do not store user information and one isn\u2019t required to provide any info in order to start using the wallet. If you are an avid cryptocurrency trader needing to keep track of multiple cryptocurrencies, Jaxx wallet is the perfect solution for you. Checkout the full Jaxx review here. In eigth place comes Green Address. This wallet was quite innovative with it\u2019s features because it was one of the first to integrate features like Hierarchical Deterministic wallets and Multisig, 2FA, and nLockTime transactions. However, thing went downhill when the site\u2019s uptime seemed to be an issue and users complained of having a hard time of logging into their wallets. However, Green Address gives you the option to backup your private keys so in case the servers go down you still have a way to recover your coins. Checkout this article for a full review of the Green Address Bitcoin Wallet. // <![CDATA[ (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); // ]]&gt; Up first is the Trezor Hardware Bitcoin Wallet. Trezor is a reputable hardware wallet launched in 2014. It allows multisig and has seamless integration with the multibit desktop wallet. Trezor is the safest way to store your bitcoins. Being a hardware wallet it is much harder to hack, if you control a significant amount of bitcoins $189 is a cheap price to pay for such a high level of security. Checkout the full Trezor Wallet Review here. The Ledger Nano wallet is the cheapest hardware wallet out of the 3 priced at $50. Just like the Trezor and the KeepKey it stores your private keys offline preventing any malware on your infected machine to compromise your wallet. Furthermore, the Ledger Nano wallet includes a security card, which acts as a 2FA featue when authorizing transaction. This physical security measure is what brings this wallet to second place. Checkout the full Ledger Nano Review here. Up next is the KeepKey Hardware Bitcoin Wallet, it comes in at a higher price point of $239 but offers a sleek design and an easy user interface for authorizing transactions. KeepKey is also an HD wallet just like Trezor and allows for secure offline storage of funds with cold storage. Launched in September of 2015 it is only 3 months old and so far has received positive feedback in the bitcoin community. Checkout the full keepkey review here.

Price plunged below $442 and the trend line was officially broken. The pivot zone at $442 \u2013 which provided support between the 14th and 15th of December \u2013 has now turned into resistance. Although the higher time frame charts are very bearish, the 30-minute chart is showing a Head & Shoulders formation.

The proposal made by Gregory Maxwell earlier this month is getting a lot of support from Bitcoin contributors, and now that the roadmap has been released, things make a lot more sense. Some interesting features are on the roadmap, which will be beneficial to the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole. Also read: Will Flywheel Be The First E-Hailing App To Accept Bitcoin Payments? As soon as the topic was raised to increase the Bitcoin block size, the digital currency community split into several camps. On the one side, there are those who want to increase the block size by quite a margin, although it is not really needed to go to extreme lengths just yet. A more scalable solution is what most people are after, but it is hard to come to a consensus on different proposals. Segregated Witness, as the proposal by Gregory Maxwell is called, seems to be the solution that will be implemented eventually. Although this concept sounds very complex on paper, the main thing to keep in mind is how this solution will gradually increase the Bitcoin block size over time. Additionally, there is no need to prepare the ecosystem regarding compatibility, as Segwit can be deployed incrementally. But there is more, as the segregated witness solution does not require existing applications to change their code either unless they want to take advantage of new features. Last but not least, transaction fees will be lowered, and support for multi-stage smart contracts and bi-directional payment channels will be made available, while not bloating the Bitcoin blockchain. The only parties involved who are advised to upgrade as soon as possible are the Bitcoin miners and wallet providers. Although this latter category does not need to upgrade if they don\u2019t want to, as segregated witness will not break backwards compatibility. All in all, this solution seems to please all parties. During the month of December 2015, the segregated witness testnet will be deployed. It is important to note this is not part of the regular Bitcoin testnet. This deployment gives Bitcoin Core contributors a chance to play around with segwit, and for wallet creators to make necessary preparations to upgrade their services. One of the most interesting features \u2013 other than the incremental block size increase \u2013 is the Libsecp256k1 verification. To put this into layman\u2019s terms: there will be a major speed boost on x86_64 hardware when verifying full nodes to join the network, as well as lighten the burden on the existing Bitcoin nodes. More nodes mean a stronger and more decentralized Bitcoin network, and anything to make that process smoother is more than welcome. April 2016 will be the time when segregated witness is fully deployed on the Bitcoin network. Block sizes will be subject to a direct capacity upgrade of up to 400%. Furthermore, this deployment puts an end to third-party malleability hurting smart contract deployment. Do keep in mind this is a tentative schedule, as all of the code has to be well reviewed before deployment.

Services such as Western Union and MoneyGram have a tight hold on this market and get away with charging outrageous fees to customers. However, an opportunity is presenting itself in Argentina, where continuing devaluing of the Argentine Peso has led to a remittance limit through traditional means. Also read: Blockchain Technology Brings Loyalty Programs To Mobile Payment Merchants While most people are accustomed to using fiat currency for remittance purposes, that solution might not be viable much longer in Argentina. Ever since the Argentine Peso exchange rate is no longer kept afloat artificially, the currency has been devaluing at a stellar pace. It goes without saying this creates a lot of financial strain on the country\u2019s economy. So much even that companies like Western Union are unable to operate under normal circumstances. Sending money abroad from Argentina has become subject to a monthly transfer limit of US$150, which is next to nothing. The reason for this is simple: the value of one Argentine Peso is declining so fast, it is next to impossible to sell the currency to exchanges at a proper value. A maximum limit of US$150 per month to move funds out of the country will not help the average citizen all that much. Keeping in mind how the previous limit was set at US$2,000 per month, there are very few options to liquidate Argentine Pesos at a proper rate. Selling the currency back to the government will never be beneficial to citizens as the government maintains different rates compared to the black market.. This creates a huge opportunity for Bitcoin in Argentina, which are [sometimes] cheaper to obtain due to these same capital controls enforced upon Western Union. But there is an interesting twist to how Bitcoin works in Argentina, as it is the only way for remittance recipients to get more value compared to what the sender paid in Argentina, according to a post on Reddit. Whether or not this financial crisis in Argentina is creating the Bitcoin killer app so many people have been waiting for, remains to be seen. One thing\u2019s for sure, though: the volatile Argentina Peso is helping Bitcoin in ways that would not be possible otherwise right now.

Obtaining partnerships with banks and other financial institutions has been a challenge for the technology giant, and alternative payment technologies could be a powerful ally. Apple Pay combined with blockchain technology, or even Bitcoin payments, is not an unlikely scenario. Also read: Bitcoin Block Size Debate \u2013 Segregated Witness Roadmap Despite being around for over a full year now, Apple Pay still hasn\u2019t made a meaningful impact on the lives of everyday consumers and shoppers. In fact, the number of users has been dwindling ever since the service launched, and it remains to be seen how and when that situation will change. But at the same time, Apple Pay is leading the charge to bring alternative forms of payment to consumers and retailers around the world in a convenient manner. The only downside to this approach is having to rely on bank partnerships, and getting payment terminals upgraded all over the world. Needless to say, neither of those downsides are being resolved anytime soon. Upgrading payment terminals is up to individual retailers, as it means an additional fee for them. Banks, on the other hand, are never keen on new partnerships, not even if that partner is a tech giant such as Apple itself. Alternative payment options and technologies are of great interest to Apple and their mobile solution. Reducing fees for retailers would be a major step in the right direction to push Apple Pay adoption to new heights. At the same time, a way to bypass the bank partnership part would solve the biggest problem right away. Luckily, such a solution already exists, in the form of blockchain technology. The currency sitting on top of that technology is known as Bitcoin, which removes high transaction fees, and clears transfers of value within seconds anywhere in the world. In a way, this solution would bring alternative options to consumers, other than credit cards. Embracing blockchain technology would give Apple multiple advantages that extend well beyond just payment processing itself. In fact, the technology giant could issue their own token on the blockchain to offer discounts, rebates, and pass on the savings directly to customers. Regardless of how one wants to look at it, the credit card was never designed to be used on such a large scale for payments. Fraud and chargebacks are more rule than exception these days, which is hurting both retailers and consumers. Bitcoin and the blockchain solve all of these issues, but market penetration is key. Apple Pay could be a valuable ally in the long run. Source: Huffington Post Images credit 1,2,3", "date": "2015-12-23T12:53:55+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 23}

Or to be more precise, Flywheel will bring its \u201cTaxiOS\u201d technology to cab owners, allowing to revamp the whole cab riding experience. Gone are the advertising systems and credit card readers, as well as their navigation systems. Similar to how Uber works, TaxiOS will only require the cab driver to possess a smartphone with Internet-connectivity. Fares for every cab ride can be split between passengers, to promote carpooling. In addition, payments can be made from within the app itself, either when the passenger books their ride, or once the driver is ready to drop them off. By revamping the cab ride experience, California hopes to bring the fight to competitors Uber and Lyft. Both of those companies have been making a name for themselves simply because they did not rely on outdated agreements and hardware requirements to let people use the service. It is important to note that, even though Flywheel can be used legally for the time being, the company has only been approved to operate for one full year. That being said, full type certification is pending, and the outcome will be decided by the end of next year. Considering how the Flywheel field trial was a great success, obtaining full type certification shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem. As enticing and exciting as the e-hail app market is in the United States, Bitcoin users are waiting anxiously to find out which company will be the first to pull the trigger on accepting digital currency payments. Accepting Bitcoin through these e-hail apps would not only be beneficial to the digital currency community, but it would alleviate a lot of the stress associated with traditional payment methods. Credit cards are still subject to high transaction fees, which take a cut out of the driver\u2019s earnings. Bitcoin payments, on the other hand, are subject to a transaction fee paid by the sender, not the recipient. It would only make sense for companies such as Flywheel to accept Bitcoin payments sooner rather than later before any of its competitors does so.

Especially where African countries are concerned, Bitcoin could do a lot of good for everyday citizens. Up until this point, Bitcoin adoption has been fairly low, but a new debate has been sparked in Kenya that might make the country the next digital currency hub. Also read: Is BIP 202 The Bitcoin Block Size Solution Everyone Can Agree On? As you would come to expect from any debate regarding Bitcoin and digital currency, the lack of regulation and oversight is a thorn in the side of government officials. However, it\u2019s not just the government that remains wary of Bitcoin, citizens in Kenya are not too keen on digital currency either, despite its lower transaction costs. Bitcoin has been around for nearly seven years now, and it has taken regulators and legislators this long to finally realize digital currency is here to stay. These people are stuck in a traditional way of thinking that doesn\u2019t account for innovations such as cryptocurrency. However, Bitcoin regulation is being worked on in various countries around the world. Additionally, there is the overall concern regarding Bitcoin being used by criminals for nefarious activity. At the same time, government officials should be more concerned with the anonymity of fiat currency, which has been funding terrorist attacks for decades. Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin is not as anonymous as fiat currency. Bitcoin does offer a great deal of pseudonymity but once the link is made between a bitcoin address and it\u2019s owner, all anonymity flies out the window. Bitpesa co-founder Elizabeth Rossiello stated: Bitpesa is one of the companies striving to bring Bitcoin to a mainstream audience in Kenya. Despite only being around for two years, Bitpesa has over 4,000 registered users [at the time of publication], showing a genuine interest in using Bitcoin for legitimate financial purposes. That being said, there remains one major downside to using Bitcoin, and that is the digital currency\u2019s volatile nature. Most Bitpesa users are forced to convert Bitcoin transfers to fiat currency immediately, as they don\u2019t want to risk on losing money by holding onto their bitcoins. This issue has been rectifying itself over the past year, though, as the Bitcoin price has remained nearly flat for an extended period of time. Regardless of how one feels about Bitcoin, there is no denying that traditional financial services are far too expensive. Sending a bank transfer to Africa is subject to fees as high as 12%, whereas sending the same amount through Bitpesa has a fee of 3%. Even for smaller amounts, this different fee structure is well worth considering. To put these fees into perspective, the World Bank pays US$110m in fees every year when it comes to remittance transfers sent to Kenya. Considering how a total of US$1.3bn is transferred to Kenya on a yearly basis, nearly 12% of that money is wasted on fees paid out to banks and other financial institutions. Not only are Bitcoin transaction fees a fraction of the current fees that banks charge for wire transfers, but bitcoin offers financial services which are impossible to achieve with traditional currency. Services such as trustless escrow, multisig, OP_HODL, and much more are not possible with government issues currency.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/is-renewable-energy-the-future-of-bitcoin-mining/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Is Renewable Energy The Future of Bitcoin Mining?", "content": "Bitcoin mining is often criticized for consuming far too much electricity, especially considering how high current prices are in most parts of the world. For many people, the electricity costs far outweigh any possible earnings from Bitcoin mining, unless they have access to cheaper electricity. The time has come for Bitcoin miners to take a closer look at renewable energy sources, as this seems to be the way forward as far as generating electricity is concerned. Also read: P2Pool Bitcoin Mining Is Far Less Popular Compared to Traditional Mining On paper, the idea of using renewable energy for Bitcoin mining seems a bit farfetched. But in reality, there are very few options remaining for people interested in mining digital currency, unless they want to move to either Georgia or Iceland, where electricity is fairly cheap. Both of those countries have heavily invested in creating renewable energy sources over the past few years. There are solutions available to Bitcoin miners all over the world, in the form of solar equipment to lower the electricity bill. What makes this concept even more interesting is how the necessary hardware can be bought with Bitcoin as well, thanks to companies such as Bimblesolar. Note from the author: The author and TheMerkle are NOT endorsing the aforementioned website. Any orders placed are the sole responsibility of the consumer. It goes without saying that renewable energy sources are drastically cheaper compared to traditional electricity. As a result, recovering the investment of the solar equipment shouldn\u2019t take all that long. Once that investment has been recuperated, miners can start lowering their electricity bill one step at a time. From an environmental perspective, renewable energy for Bitcoin mining makes a lot of sense as well. Other than the electricity required to power all of this hardware, there is a carbon footprint to take into account as well. Helping out the environment, as well as saving on electricity costs, seems to be the golden combination. When deciding to venture into the world of renewable energy for Bitcoin mining purposes, there are a few factors to take into consideration. First of all, one has to decide how they want to power their miner, by either getting an On Grid system or a Hybrid system. Both options have their advantages, although there is no cookie-cutter solution for every Bitcoin miner out there. Technically speaking, anyone in the world can access renewable energy, but that doesn\u2019t make it the best solution for every Bitcoin miner. Some parts of the world will not be eligible for shipping solar power energy solutions, making this a less than a favorable solution for those regions. Additionally, there are a lot of people who will be facing a hard time making any sort of profit from mining Bitcoin, even when using renewable energy sources. The overall investment cost for obtaining Bitcoin hardware, getting it delivered, and , maintaining it at stable speeds is not worth the hassle for a lot of people. Instead, those users will opt for other solutions such as cloud mining. But even in this sector, a lot of companies could benefit from looking into renewable energy sources. Granted, it requires a huge cash flow to get the ball rolling, but there is no reason not to contemplate the possibilities in this day and age.

While that might not be something out of the ordinary, Coinbase ended up closing the user\u2019s account after his help. Even though he was paid a small bug bounty for his findings \u2013 and never used Coinbase for buying or selling BTC \u2013 the company effectively banned the user for an unknown reason. Also read: SaruTobi Players Can Now Obtain Counterparty Tokens Based on the detailed report found on Reddit, Coinbase was \u2013 at one time \u2013 facing a severe exploit that could have bankrupted the company. The company\u2019s \u201cVault\u201d service, which is used by many people to store bitcoins in a safe and secure manner, has not always been without flaws or vulnerabilities The Reddit user, who goes by the name of David Jones mentioned how he was able to withdraw infinite amounts of Bitcoin from CoinBase Vault, even if he did not own those coins to begin with. No user should be able to create a negative balance on the platform, yet a screenshot shows how this was possible at one point. It goes without saying that public knowledge of this exploit could have cost Coinbase several millions of dollars. Instead of using this exploit for nefarious purposes, Mr. Jones reported the incident to Coinbase as part of the company\u2019s bug bounty program. After a thorough step-by-step explanation of how this vulnerability could be exploited, Coinbase managed to fix the problem and rewarded the user with a US$5,000 bounty. Some people might say the reward should have been substantially higher, though. It didn\u2019t take long for things to take a turn for the worst, as Coinbase then proceeded to lock David\u2019s account without any warning or responding to support tickets. As a result, the user could no longer withdraw any funds from Coinbase. Not exactly the attitude one would come to expect from a company that could have lost millions, but was fortunate enough to have one user report the issue. But that isn\u2019t the worst part, as a very similar exploit to the first one was discovered shortly afterwards by the same user! Coinbase marked this second exploit as \u201cinformative\u201d. According to David: When the user asked for an explanation as to why his account was banned, he received the following response: Mr. Jones explains that he believes the reason Coinbase banned him was because they didn\u2019t want to pay out the second bounty. In response, Charlie Lee, Director of Engineering at Coinbase said that the account ban wasn\u2019t due to the user\u2019s bug reporting. He also summarized the exploit as follows: All in all the exploit did not cause any actual losses and the user was never able to withdraw more bitcoins than he had. So, in the eyes of Charlie Lee a $5000 reward seemed like a more than reasonable amount for essentially a front end bug. Over the past six years, various Bitcoin companies and platforms have become the target of exploits and hacking attempts. In a few cases, user funds have been stolen, and bug bounty programs could have prevented most of those issues. The attitude shown by Coinbase is, even though this is an unconfirmed and one-sided report, anything but professional. Without users identifying and reporting bugs, there will always be a chance for user funds to be stolen by assailants. This is not beneficial to the Bitcoin ecosystem, as users are taking the full responsibility for their financial wealth at any given time. We can only hope more companies show their true appreciation when users identify key problems that could turn out to be very costly.

However, there seems to be good news, as a new GitHub proposal has been made by Jeff Garzik to incrementally increase the Bitcoin block size over time. BIP 202 is not overly complicated, and could end up being the solution everybody has been waiting for. Also Read: Can Companies Simplify The Conversion From Bitcoin To Fiat Currency? Even though very few Bitcoin blocks come remotely close to the artificial block size limit of 1MB, there have been various proposals to increase this maximum size for quite some time now. As Bitcoin gains more popularity, the number of network transactions will increase, which could lead to confirmation delays if the block size is kept at 1 MB. Coming to a consensus on how this block size should be increased, has proven to be quite a struggle. Many people want to swing for the fences and increase the block size by quite a margin when the next block reward halving takes place. However, there are some serious drawbacks to that solution. First of all, the Chinese mining pools \u2013 which represent the majority of the Bitcoin network hashrate \u2013 are not in favor of very big blocks, as the local Internet infrastructure is unable to cope with the demand of large data chunks. Secondly, the blockchain is already huge in size as it is right now, and adding blocks five times the current size to that chain will only make things even worse. Last but not least, there has to be a majority consensus before things can change, and with the current proposals, that has proven to be nearly impossible. Bitcoin Core developer Jeff Garzik came up with an alternative solution that, on paper, seems to please all parties involved. BIP 202, as this solution is called, will double the block size to 2 MB, as well as small further increases over time. This proposal would be acceptable for Chinese mining pools as 2 MB blocks are not that huge of a difference. Additionally, the Chinese Internet infrastructure will \u2013 hopefully \u2013 be upgraded sooner or later to cope with more data consumption. Smaller incremental block size increases leave plenty of time for this infrastructure to take place, or find other solutions in the meantime. At the time of publication, it remained to be seen whether or not anyone wants to support BIP 202. Jeff Garzik\u2019s idea holds a lot of merit that can be beneficial to all parties involved. The question remains whether or not the majority of the Bitcoin network \u2013 including mining pools and payment processors \u2013 will come to a decision sooner rather than later.

But that isn\u2019t keeping people from giving it a try anyway, as there is some good money to be made. One of the lingering questions is why so very few people use P2Pool mining, rather than centralized mining pools. Also read: SaruTobi Players Can Now Obtain Counterparty Tokens From a convenience point of view, traditional mining pools make a lot more sense to Bitcoin miners. All they have to do is register a new account, set up their mining software to point to the mining pool, and earnings will start trickling in after a few hours. Plus, most regular Bitcoin mining pools offer a somewhat decent user interface, making them more approachable for novice users. However, there is nothing wrong with P2Pool mining in general either. While the layout is far less pleasing on the eyes in most cases, the process remains virtually the same. One of the major differences is how users will not have to register an account to start P2Pool Bitcoin mining, which some might see as an advantage. On paper, there should be no reason either solution is far more popular compared to the other> But in reality, it is clear that P2Pool mining is not as popular as it could \u2013 or perhaps should \u2013 be. Human nature can be partially blamed for that, as our society has grown accustomed to using centralized solutions and platforms. At its core, P2Pool mining is true to core bitcoin values, as this is the only way to decentralize the mining process. However, there are some vast differences as well, a mining share difficulty is much higher where P2Pool mining is concerned, resulting in fewer shares being submitted and validated. To some users, this creates the illusion of something being wrong with the mining process, although this is not the case. One of the main things to take into consideration when getting involved in the Bitcoin mining scene is whether or not the earnings are maximized at any given time. Both traditional and P2Pool mining optimize user earnings in a different way, although they should produce similar results over an extended period of time. Regardless of which option one chooses, it is important to keep in mind one is competing against the rest of the Bitcoin network to earn money. At the time of publication, the number of Bitcoin P2Pool mining options was fairly limited. Setting up the software itself is a bit of a challenge for mining pool operators, whereas centralized mining pools take less effort in the beginning. Additionally, P2Pool mining requires more CPU power and memory for both miner and pool operator to optimize mining efficiency. Last but not least, P2Pool miners are paid part of the transaction fees generated by the Bitcoin network, This is something a lot of people tend to overlook, and the amounts might not add up to high values, but it\u2019s still worth mentioning. More awareness regarding decentralized Bitcoin mining needs to be raised to reduce the number of centralized mining pools.

While it may seem only normal for people to mix up their Bitcoin transaction history at some point, there is also the pressing question of which services can be trusted. The short answer to that question is absolutely none, as coin mixers are third-party centralized service providers. Also read: Bitcoin Exchanges Comparison On paper, there is absolutely nothing wrong with mixing your Bitcoins through one of the many coin mixing services available in the world today. One thing to keep in mind when using such a service is how users are entrusting their funds to a random third-party anonymous stranger, in the hopes of getting their coins back from a different Bitcoin wallet address. Some people might be wondering why anyone would want to anonymize their Bitcoin balance in the first place, as the underlying blockchain technology acts as a transparent public ledger. Most people see the upside of this level of transparency, as it creates a complete public overview of the funds in circulation, as well as the transactions being broadcasted to the network in real-time. At the same time, there are people who want to see Bitcoin as a way to anonymously generate and maintain funds, If mainstream media outlets had a say in the matter, Bitcoin has always been used for nefarious activity due to its anonymity. So why keep associating digital currency with anonymity and illegal activities? Anonymity on the Internet is far more important when it comes to financial matters. Bitcoin offers pseudonymity at its core, which is an important first step towards user privacy. But for certain users, this isn\u2019t enough, as they want to keep their identity secret, as well as the true origin of their coins. Coin mixers are a powerful tool to achieve the goal of truly anonymous sources of Bitcoin. However, every coin mixer is an independently operated third-party service, and users might never see their coins back. Keeping in mind how Bitcoin transactions are not refundable, it is important to keep in mind that losing funds by using a mixing service is one\u2019s own fault. There is a new type of mixing service called JoinMarket which unlike other coin mixers does not rely on entrusting your funds to a third party. Not only can you anonymize your bitcoins with that service, but you can also earn some satoshis while helping others. According to their bitcointalk thread, JoinMarket is for people who 1. Want to use coinjoin to improve the privacy of their bitcoin transactions or reduce the miner fees they pay. 2. Want to earn an income from their investment bitcoins You can find out more about Join Market / Coin Join by visiting their github repository According to a recent Reddit post, using a Bitcoin exchange to anonymize transactions would be a more viable alternative. While it is true that coins can be anonymized in a certain way when using a cryptocurrency exchange, users are still relying on third party service providers to return money to them. In the end, this renders the entire concept of financial control by the end user completely useless. Unlike fiat currency, Bitcoin provides unprecedented transparency for everyone in the world to see. That core principle is both a blessing and a curse. The only viable option right now is to use Join Market to anonymize your bitcoins without relying on a third party to take care of your funds. Bringing the profit back to the consumer is what Blockchain technology is all about. Trustless escrow, smart contracts, multisig, etc. are all next generation services which beat the archaic centralized models of most services today.

Depending on which exchange one uses, deposits and withdrawals in certain local currency might not be possible for whatever reason. A simpler and more convenient solution has to be found sooner or later. Also read: Joomla Websites Vulnerable To Critical Exploit Converting Bitcoin into fiat currency through a Bitcoin exchange can be quite a challenge unless one deals in any of the three major currencies (USD, EUR, and CNY). Depending on the Bitcoin exchange itself, they might not always accept withdrawals denominated in a certain currency, even though making deposits with the same currency is not a problem. This is one of the major problems the arises when being forced to rely on traditional financial tools such as bank accounts and debit cards. International transactions for returning funds to customers are subject to different legislative and regulatory requirements compared to receiving deposits. In fact, this is one of the issues Bitcoin has been addressing since day one, as the popular digital currency does not discriminate based on location or local currency. Instead, one Bitcoin in the US works the same in Asia, Europe, or even Oceania. Regular financial services operate in a completely different way, and communication across continents requires multiple intermediary parties. Unfortunately for everybody involved in the Bitcoin ecosystem, withdrawing funds from an exchange means either using a bank account or debit card. If the exchange of your choice does not accept billing details from your country, issues arise. Additionally, international wire transfers to get funds out can prove to be quite costly, depending on one\u2019s location. A possible option is selling Bitcoin through the LocalBitcoins platform, where sellers can set their own payment methods for receiving funds. The interesting part about LocalBitcoins is how the platform is tailored to accommodate local market trends, such as supporting local bank accounts, PayPal, or other popular payment options. The main problem is how everyday consumers are forced to convert Bitcoin back to local fiat currency to pay bills and whatnot. In Europe, there is a service that lets you pay bills with Bitcoin for a small fee. The only downside to this service is how it\u2019s not available to customers using local currencies other than EUR [right now]. This begs the question whether or not here is a growing demand for more Bitcoin-to-fiat conversion options, or if there is a big need for service that let us pay bills in BTC. Very few companies accept Bitcoin for bill payments, and intermediary solutions have to take local legislation and regulatory requirements into account.

Several companies have tried to come up with a way for citizens in these countries to preserve their wealth. With the US Dollar tearing up the charts in recent weeks, it seems to be the most logical choice as far as fiat currencies are concerned. But there is more to AirTM than just preserving wealth, as the platform offers a few different options as well. One of the most obvious use cases for AirTM is how users can make or receive US Dollar payments through the platform. Also, there is an option for users to move local currency from their bank account into the AirTM cloud, and make payments in any other currency. The conversion between currencies will take place through Uphold, an exchange platform that also lists popular digital currency Bitcoin. What makes AirTM most appealing is how everyone can use the platform to become a cashier, which will allow users to make a decent amount of money by completing deposits and withdrawals. It is important to note the service is only open to the public in Argentina and Venezuela, whereas the invitation-only beta status is maintained in Mexico, the US, and China. At the time of publication, over 856 customers have been using AirTM to send, receive, and store US Dollar in the cloud. Furthermore, the company announced how so many use cases have been discovered in this service, including paying for studies abroad and entrepreneurs looking to operate more efficiently. Depending on how one might want to look at things, AirTM could be seen as a fierce competitor for Bitcoin adoption in certain regions. At the same time, the platform allows users to make payments from the cloud, and Uphold has Bitcoin listed on their exchange platform as one of the supported currencies. Bitcoin does not need third-party services to impact the financial status of its users around the world. Instead, one can transfer Bitcoin to and from anyone in the world in a matter of seconds, by using a computer or mobile device.

We decided to create a chart and compare some of the top exchanges in the market. The exchanges are ranked based on a combination of a few key factors: liquidity, trading volume, information required to start trading, fees, and exchange features. Bitfinex Bitfinex is one of the most popular Bitcoin Exchanges on the market. Launched at the end of 2013 Bitfinex is a reputable exchange based in China, with its advanced trading features and leverage trading it takes the crown as the top rated exchange on our list. The leverage is limited to 3:3:1 but that is more than enough for such a volatile market. Bitfinex allows limit, market, stop, trailing stop, and fill/kill orders. If you are interested use the following code s2bJ8O2sqA to get a 10% discount off of your trading and swap fees for the first month following registration Compared to other exchanges, Bitfinex has much more freedom/room to play around as a trader, it evens allows for borrowing or lending. The main pro about Bitfinex is that it allows you to short BTC, something which you cannot do on most exchanges, checkout this Full Bitfinex Review. Coinbase The Coinbase Exchange is a relatively new exchange launched at the beginning of 2015 by Coinbase \u2013 a Bitcoin Bank based in the United States. The exchange is fully compliant with an active KYC/AML program, furthermore the service may ask additional information regarding source of income and/or your use case for bitcoins. It comes in as second on our list because it lacks some features which Bitfinex has, on the other hand, Coinbase is fully compliant, has terrific customer service, and a great reputation in the bitcoin community. The exchange itself has a beautiful layout with a sleek design, it has basic trading features such as buy / sell orders and limit orders. The interface is intuitive and placing orders is easy, checkout this Full Coinbase Exchange Review. BTC-E BTC-E is the longest standing exchange in this list, launch back in 2011 it still stands strong today. It comes in as third on our list because of its long history of operation and the fact that you are not required to hand the exchange sensitive information about your identity. The lack of a proper KYC/AML program makes the exchange so controversial, however, it is the only exchange while allows for a truly free market where anyone from any country can trade bitcoins. BtcXindia BTCXIndia is the number one Bitcoin exchange for Indian residents. It\u2019s headquarters are in Hyderabad and they are fully compliant with KYC/AML policies in their country. At present, BTCXIndia does not charge any deposit / withdrawal fees but they do have a live orderbook with Buy / Sell options for which they charge a 1% fee for every trade. According to David Marshall from the BTCXIndia marketing team, only Indian citizens are allowed to trade on the exchange. To become verified for trading they must pass Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) checks and submit a \u2018Know Your Customer\u2019 (KYC) form. This form requests key details including the applicant\u2019s name and contact details as well as bank account information, a passport photo, a copy of official ID, proof of address and a signature. This level of customer disclosure is in line with the processes used by leading financial institutions and keeps our exchange secure for users.

In countries where very tight capital controls reign supreme, obtaining BTC and a virtual Bitcoin debit card could be the way forward for starting a brand new small business. Also read: Five Reasons Why Apple Pay is Not A Success It is no secret that finding a regular job can prove to be quite a hassle in this day and age. Either one does not have the \u201crelevant\u201d work experience, or they don\u2019t have the correct degree to do a certain job. Even with proper degrees, chances on the job market are not increasing, as those employees come with a far higher price tag. Furthermore, not everyone in the world has access to financial tools like the Western world. In a lot of places obtaining a bank account, or even a credit card, is next to impossible. That doesn\u2019t mean these people should be \u201cslaves\u201d of capital controls, but there are very few options at their disposal to do anything about it. Bitcoin presents a way out in multiple forms. Not only is Bitcoin not controlled by banks or governments, but its technology can also bring financial services to the unbanked and underbanked people of this planet. One particular example is the introduction of Bitcoin debit cards, or to be more precise, the virtual variety of these cards. While capital controls can still play a factor in obtaining Bitcoin through exchanges, most people will manage to convert a small portion of fiat currency to digital currency relatively easy. Once that step has been completed, the Bitcoin world is one\u2019s oyster, so to speak, as there is a variety of options at anyone\u2019s disposal. Obtaining a virtual Bitcoin debit card is the next logical step, as it allows people to spend Bitcoin wherever credit cards and debit cards are accepted. Online marketplaces such as eBay, Alibaba, and nearly every other e-commerce platform in the world accept these virtual cards. Also, popular payment processors like Skrill and PayPal accept virtual Bitcoin debit cards without too many problems. Various companies offer these virtual Bitcoin debit cards, such as Advcash, E-Coin, Spectrocoin, and others. Once a user purchases their virtual debit card, it will be activated in a matter of minutes, after which the balance can be topped up with Bitcoin. All in all, the entire process takes a few hours at most. Obtaining access to such powerful e-commerce platforms then opens up business opportunities all over the world. Buying cheap items with a virtual Bitcoin debit card, and re-selling those items in local markets for a [minor] profit is a perfect example of how digital currency can create jobs. None of this would have been possible by relying on the traditional financial system. Have you ever used a [virtual] Bitcoin debit card? What has your experience been like so far?

The $442 area is now a fairly established pivot zone; acting twice as resistance and another two times as support. There is another major pivot zone that can be observed on the 30-minute chart, which just happens to be preventing the market from breaking higher. Of course I am referring to $461.50. This level gave the market some pause on the 15th, and is now acting as resistance once again. Despite the two large sell-offs, the trend line has not been broken just yet. The 2-hour chart is showing that the market is getting into a tighter trading range. A triangle formation can also be made out quite clearly. Litecoin \u2013 which closely correlates with Bitcoin \u2013 is also showing a similar pattern. It is very clear that pressure is building up and that a violent break is imminent. If price breaks lower towards the pivot at $442, then the trend line will be violated, and that could be the trigger that breaks the current bull market.

Financial institutions across Europe and the US are looking to secure their .bank top-level domain. Whether or not this solution will be a successful one, remains to be seen. Perhaps we will see a .bitcoin domain name in the future as well? Also read: Prizerebel Now Pays Out In Bitcoin Through SNAPCARD Rather than stepping up overall platform security, financial institutions are looking for alternative solutions to keep customers safe from harm. Over 300 European banks and other institutions have registered an application to obtain their own .bank top-level domain name, rather than to rely on .com or .net domain extensions. Additionally, over 4,000 .bank domain name applications have been registered in the United States as well. The main goal of using this exclusive .bank domain name is to prevent phishing websites from being mistaken as the real deal. Such an attempt to steal user information can be quite successful, despite consumers being warned about banks never asking for personal information via email or through a website. Obtaining a .bank domain name is not easy, as there is a rigorous process involved. Doing so would prevent just about anyone from applying for this domain extension, as it is only intended for banks, insurance companies, and respectable trade associations. Furthermore, this initiative is made possible thanks to the fTLD Registry Services, a private company founded and endorsed by various major financial players. During the application process, institutions will have to go through over 30 enhanced security requirements, all of which are specifically designed to create a trusted, verified, and more secure location for online banking business. Considering the one-time fee for a .bank domain name is US$1,500; it is clearly designed for traditional financial institutions only. CentralNic CEO Ben Crawford stated: While phishing attempts are common in the traditional financial world, they seem to be far less effective where Bitcoin and digital currency are concerned. This can be attributed to the fact that the average Bitcoin user is far more tech-savvy and less likely to fall for a phishing attempt. Additionally, there is no way to recover stolen Bitcoin funds, making people far more cautious when they receive a suspicious email. A .bitcoin or .btc domain name could be introduced at a later stage, although it remains to be seen whether or not Bitcoin companies will decide to register such a premium top level domain. Bitcoin companies have stepped up their security game from a consumer point of view quite some time ago, and fancy domain names are not a proper solution. Note from the Author: The .bit domain name already exists, but it is far from popular so far.

Popular referral/conga website Prizerebel is now paying out its users in Bitcoin, rather than relying on just gift cards or Paypal payments. Doing so creates an easy way for novice users to get their hands on Bitcoin, without having to go through an exchange\u2019s verification process. Also read: Bitcoin Exchange Digatrade Shows How Verification Procedures Need To Change The concept of \u201cget-paid-to\u201d websites is nothing new under the sun, and websites like Prizerebel have been very popular for quite some time now. Users will have to complete tasks that are either free or cost a small amount of money, for which they will be rewarded with points on the Prizerebel website. Once a user reaches a certain point threshold, they can exchange these earnings for either a gift card or a PayPal payment worth a certain amount of money. Accepting such a PayPal payment could lead to one\u2019s account being flagged for suspicious activity, which creates more hassle than it\u2019s worth for most people. Prizerebel is taking a different approach to converting these points to something users can spend, by offering an option to receive Bitcoin payments. To be more precise, Prizerebel offers the option to convert a points balance to a Bitcoin SNAPCARD, which can be used by anyone in the world. Similar to how their other payout options work, don\u2019t expect to get rich overnight by getting involved in Prizerebel. It takes 500 points to receive a US$5 payout in Bitcoin or 1,000 points for a US$10 payment, and so on. That being said, this does create an alternative way for people to get their hands on Bitcoin without going through a verification process. The integration with SNAPCARD is quite interesting, as it is one of the \u201clesser known\u201d Bitcoin wallet solutions in existence today.

According to a recent post on Reddit, Canadian Bitcoin exchange Digatrade is taking its sweet time for completing the verification process. Also Read: Blockchain Technology Is The Answer To Invisible Credit Rating Marks When it comes to verifying one\u2019s identity for either buying or selling Bitcoin, the process shouldn\u2019t take all that long. Most Bitcoin exchanges can offer a verification process that won\u2019t take longer than 24 hours, although some companies are exploring the boundaries of semi-instant processes as well. But there are certain exceptions to this unwritten rule, as Canadian Bitcoin exchange Digatrade is taking much longer than is generally accepted these days. A post on Reddit describes how one user, in particular, has been waiting three weeks \u2013 not days, weeks \u2013 to get the verification process completed. This begs the question as to what could2 be taking so long. Apparently, Digatrade sends a verification code by mail \u2013 or in this case; it has been sent twice already \u2013 yet never arrived. There doesn\u2019t seem to way to bypass this code through any other means, If such a code doesn\u2019t arrive the first time, nor the second time, consumers will start to get very frustrated. What makes matters even worse for this Digatrade customer is how all customer support staff is based in Hong Kong, rather than Canada. Due to the time zone difference, there are huge delays in getting support tickets answered, and live communication is pretty much out of the question entirely. After getting fed up with the situation, the Reddit user signed up with \u201ccompetitor\u201d Bitcoin exchange QuadrigaCX and got the account verified within the hour. The main difference is how QuadrigaCX offers voice verification by a real person, rather than sending a code via mail that can get lost quite easily. Digatrade will need to step up their verification process, as well as customer support service if they want to keep attracting new users. These types of delays are not acceptable, and the lack of support will turn novice users away from Bitcoin in general.Competitors have far more appealing verification procedures, so there is no reason to stick to the current mind boggling model. The diversity of Bitcoin exchanges can be both a good and a bad thing at the same time. Consumers want quick and easy access to platforms to buy and sell Bitcoin, and having to wait for verification codes via mail is not the way to go anymore. WhIle this option offers more security in a way, a personal verification phone call can go a long way to making customers feel more appreciated.

Microsoft is the most recent company to announce their project, although they have taken a page out of Apple\u2019s book and opted to go with carrier billing for now. Users will be able to make purchases by adding the charges to their monthly phone bill. Also read: European Interest in Contactless Payments Creates Bitcoin Adoption Opportunities It is rather strange to see Microsoft enter this space, as they are not exactly one of the major players in the mobile device world right now. That being said, tons of consumers around the world use portable devices running Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system, and their new smartphone lines are gaining momentum all over the world. Carrier billing is an interesting spin on the mobile payment ecosystem as we know it today. Rather than linking existing financial tools to a new application, carrier billing lets consumers buy things, and adds the charges to their monthly phone bill. Apple users in Russia and Germany can use this method to make iTunes purchases from their mobile devices. For Microsoft, the plan is to offer a similar service, and enabling pay-with-your-phone-number purchases in the Windows Store. For example, any Windows 10 user will be able to make purchases on any of their devices running the OS, by simply entering their mobile phone number during the checkout process. Don\u2019t expect to purchase any expensive items just yet, as the offerings are limited to movies, games, apps, and music. The United States will be the first ones to test this new mobile payment scheme by Microsoft, and other carriers and countries will be coming soon. According to Boku, Switzerland will be the next country on the roll-out list. There is quite some potential for carrier billing to become one of the hottest mobile payment trends in the world, especially as far as developing countries are concerned. Banking infrastructure is not available all over the world, yet most people have access to a mobile phone number. Harnessing this existing infrastructure will bring financial services to the unbanked and underbanked. Carrier billing is not the only interesting market Microsoft is focusing their attention on. In recent months, the company has openly expressed their interest in blockchain technology, by adding Ethereum as-a-service to their Azure platform. Furthermore, Microsoft is accepting Bitcoin payments themselves, so it\u2019s not unlikely they will start mixing mobile payments and Bitcoin at some point. Similar to how carrier billing works, Bitcoin is available to everyone on this planet who has a mobile device or computer. The main difference is how there are no agreements with mobile providers required to use Bitcoin as a payment method, as the digital currency works, in the same way, regardless of location.

Russia has gotten fed up with being rated by Western credit rating agencies, so they have created a new agency altogether. Whether or not this will be beneficial to the Russian economy, remains to be seen. Also read: Bitwage Further Enhances User Privacy It goes without saying that not just anyone can start their own credit rating agency. Or at least, that is what most people always assumed, although Russia is proving them wrong in that regard. The Russian central bank started this initiative as a way to fight back against the dominance of Western agencies and hopefully improve the country\u2019s economic outlook. Agencies like Moody\u2019s, Fitch, and Standard & Poor\u2019s have become household names when it comes to credit ratings for countries and economies around the world. However, all of these credit rating agencies have one thing in common: they are all located in the Western world. Russia, on the other hand, is more of an Eastern world country, and the friction between both sides still exists to this very day. Protecting Russia\u2019s economy from\u201d geopolitical risks\u201d is the official reason for creating Analytical Credit Rating Agency. However, there are those who feel this ploy is just a way of showing how any country in the world ca file the necessary paperwork and create a brand new credit rating agency out of thin air. Furthermore, this move could alienate the Russian economy from the rest of the world even more. Over the course of recent years, a divide has been created between Russia and most other countries in the world. Recent Western sanctions over Ukraine, combined with the falling oil prices, have not helped out the economy in the country at all. When a country can \u201cjudge\u201d its own economic health, nothing good will ever come from this scenario. It wouldn\u2019t be that far of a stretch to think Bitcoin will be gaining a lot of popularity in Russia over the coming years, despite stark warnings from government officials not to get involved in digital currency. That being said, Bitcoin offers far more transparency and public accountability than the Russian economy ever well. Creating the Analytical Credit Rating Agency is only obfuscating things, even more, which is the last thing Russia needs right now.

Andreas M. Antonopoulos is one of the most prominent members of the Bitcoin ecosystem today, and he has a project on GitHub allowing users to pay their Wifi minutes with Bitcoin. What is really interesting is how the project uses the 21 Inc Bitcoin Computer as the authentication server for any OpenWRT router running Wifiportal21. Also read: Microsoft Enables Carrier Billing For Windows Store \u2013 Bitcoin Integration Soon? Slowly but surely, more and more people are starting to unlock the true potential of the 21 Inc. Bitcoin Computer. Other than the embedded mining chip, this device offers a powerful tool for aspiring developers to create all types of interesting projects along the way. Wifiportal21, created by Andreas M. Antonopoulos, is just one example of how the Bitcoin Computer can be used. It is important to keep in mind that, even though this project is publicly available on GitHub, the latest build is still in its experimental stage. Wifiportal21 is an authentication portal that will allow users to buy Wifi minutes with Bitcoin. There are two prerequisites to using Wifiportal21 though: the router needs to be running on OpenWRT, and have Wifidog installed. Full installation instructions can be found here. Installing the Wifiportal21 authentication server is quite easy, as users simply have to download the file to a directory on their 21 Inc Bitcoin Computer. Once that is done the config.py file will need to be edited, and the values for xpub and billing rate will have to be replaced. Then it\u2019s just a matter of installing the package and running the authentication server itself. Paying for Wifi minutes in Bitcoin is a versatile way to show off Bitcoin\u2019s strengths as far as microtransactions are concerned. Rather than using traditional payment methods, which involve high fees, Bitcoin is more suited for smaller transactions. Plus, Bitcoin is a global payment method, so users wouldn\u2019t have to worry about exchange rates when paying for Wifi connectivity. What makes Wifiportal21, even more, appealing is how the service requires no login, authentication, or personal identification to be used. As a result, no personal user information will be collected, and user privacy will be respected. A payment QR code will be presented to the customer, and once paid, Internet access will be made available automatically.

Also read: Russia Launches Own Credit Rating Agency \u2013 Door Is Wide Open For Bitcoin Finding quality employees is not an easy task these days, despite there being so many bright minds looking for a new job. Even for companies like Coinbase, it has turned out to be more lucrative for them to keep engineers moving abroad onboard as remote workers, rather than replacing them altogether. There are many advantages to hiring remote engineers, as it opens up the pool of potential employees for companies around the world. Coinbase has seen the value of remote workers \u2013 partially through their own initiative to keep certain people on board \u2013 and decided to open up this opportunity to applications all over the world. Keeping employees motivated while they are \u201cslaving away\u201d at local headquarters is difficult enough, but when remote workers are involved, it\u2019s harder to keep a close eye on things. That being said, Coinbase has identified several key factors that keep remote engineers happy and focused. It has become increasingly easy for companies to gamble big on hiring remote engineers, thanks to the availability of high-speed Internet connectivity all over the world. This allows remote workers to use the same type of ad-hoc communication used at the company headquarters, which in turns boosts productivity. A lot of the success associated with working remotely depends on the employee in question. Some people work far better at their own home when being left alone with clear instructions to follow, whereas others prefer to be part of the \u201chive mind\u201d at company HQ. Remote engineers will need to possess strong intrinsic motivation. Additionally, Coinbase will fly in remote workers every quarter for a short period, giving them a chance to spend quality time with the team in-person. This will also help remote workers to understand the inner working of Coinbase and its employees, which will pave the way for new successes. It will be interesting to see how this hiring process for Coinbase will turn out.

Cash transactions prove to be quite a hassle at times, and consumers want to spend as little tile as possible on making payments. Contactless payments are an answer to this solution, and this form of payment is gaining a lot of momentum across all of Europe. In the long run, this could benefit Bitcoin adoption as well. Also read: Microsoft Experimenting with Ripple on Azure Blockchain Developer Environment Research from RBR shows that, at the end of 2014, 15% of all payment cards across Europe had contactless payment capabilities. That is quite a significant number, considering how major card issuers Visa and Mastercard have not even begun the major rollout of their new cards and payment terminals in Europe yet. But that is not the only interesting trend, as the number of contactless transactions has grown exponentially as well. A total of 1.4 billion contactless payments, worth \u20ac15 billion, had been made in Europe by the end of 2014.Compared to 2013, those numbers increased by 155\u00a3 and 190% respectively, showing a growing interest in the contactless payment option by European. Despite these very promising numbers, there is still a lot of work to be done before contactless payments can be deemed a \u201c mainstream success\u201d. Compared to the total amount of card transactions and their respective values, contactless payments only represent 2\u00a3 of all transactions and 0.5% of the total card payment value for 2014. But there is some positive news too, as the number of cards equipped for contactless payments will treble by 2020, increasing its market share to nearly 40% of all European payment cards. Just increasing the number of contactless payment cards on its own is not sufficient, though, as payment terminals will need to be upgraded as well. This is where Visa and Mastercard will start a more aggressive campaign, by increasing the number of terminals to accept contactless payments come early 2016. Eventually, all of the existing terminals will be upgraded by early 2020, which evens the playing field for both contactless and regular card payments. As more and more payment terminals across Europe will be equipped with NFC capabilities, there is a major opportunity for Bitcoin adoption as well. Retailers and consumers are not yet used to making contactless payments, yet once they do, using Bitcoin will become much easier as it is very similar to this new system they learned to use. Bitcoin payments have had contactless payment capabilities for quite some time now, yet user adoption has always been on the low end. Piggybacking on the efforts by Visa and MasterCard \u2013 albeit indirectly \u2013 doesn\u2019t have to be a negative thing. As long as consumers have multiple payment options at their disposal, Bitcoin adoption will thrive sooner or later.

During the meeting, the board also discussed about ways of increasing their income, by raising more money from the DevCore workshops, and partnering up with various organizations. The meeting was then wrapped up with an interesting request made by Pierce. He proceeded to pledge a donation of $10,000, in case the rest of the board would be committed to carry out the same exercise. \u201cWe are the Foundation, we have no resources, this is us, if you don\u2019t like the foundation as it stands, you don\u2019t like yourself \u2026 each board member should be prepared to do the work themselves, to keep the Foundation going.\u201d Based on everything that has been outlined so far, do you think that the Bitcoin Foundation will end up running out of money?

There are always two sides to a medallion, and the concept of hacking is no different in that regard. On the one hand, there are the criminal internet hackers, but there are also those who hack for the greater good. Not every hacking attempt is bad, as it will provide companies with valuable insights as to how their security is holding up. Also read: No Bitcoins Were Stolen Before Dorkbot Botnet Was Shut Down Regardless of which side of the hacker camp you are on, there is one major parallel between both parties: they both take matters into their own hands. The \u201cgood\u201d hackers will be on the lookout for any platform or service that might pose a security risk, and attempt to take it down. One example of such a platform would be taking down forums where child pornography is publicly advertised. People are capable of doing some very dangerous and horrible things to one another, and law enforcement can only do so much as long as there is no imminent threat. In some cases, hacktivists \u2013 or even white hat hackers \u2013 will look for any site vulnerability they can exploit and shut down the service. As one hacker stated in an interview with CNN Money, everyone is capable of doing something for the greater good. Some people use hacking to achieve that goal, whereas others are benefactors for charitable causes. Every individual on this planet has a particular set of skills, and they should embrace that skillset, rather than ignore it As you would come to expect, most hackers are former \u2013 or current \u2013 security researchers. Getting involved in the world of IT, infrastructure, and software security can produce some of the greatest innovations in the world. But at the same time, these innovations need to be protected, and standard means are only doing so much. Another option worth exploring for white hat hackers and hacktivists is how they can monetize their particular set of skills. Getting hired to shut down a forum or service is not as common as most people think. Instead, they will rather sell information about exploits they have found or created. However, most of them will never sell that information to the government or any of its affiliates. But this \u201cglamorous\u201d lifestyle comes at a heavy price as well. Hackers and hacktivists are unable to get a regular job and earn a normal income. Their mindset is so different from everyday people that it is hard for them to function in the traditional business world. Plus, there is always the adrenaline rush of getting your hands on something that, technically speaking, you shouldn\u2019t even be able to access. Hacking for whatever purpose has become part of everyday life in the world of technology. Even Bitcoin companies see a certain value in paying white hat hackers a bug bounty for every vulnerability or exploit they can find on the platform. Ensuring security measures are up to standard is a 24/7 job, and any help is more than welcome. A variety of Bitcoin platforms have been hacked over the past few years, but it looks like that scenario is coming to an end. Companies are stepping up their security game by actively engaging with security researchers and pen testers. Internal security audits are a good thing, but they are not always sufficient. Plus, because Bitcoin is a global currency, it\u2019s much easier to pay bug bounty rewards to people from all over the world. What are your thoughts on hacking and hacktivists? Are they beneficial to the Bitcoin ecosystem? Let us know in the comments below! Source: CNN Money Images credit 1,2,3", "date": "2015-12-07T08:45:50+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 12, "day": 7}

Unfortunately for the end consumer, this is such a fractured landscape, and it will take a while until a platform comes along most people can use for everyday purchases. Whether or not that solution will be Walmart Pay, remains to be seen. All this competition does is showcase Bitcoin\u2019s strengths as a universal payment method. Also read: European Interest in Contactless Payments Creates Bitcoin Adoption Opportunities Not too long ago, Walmart made it very clear that they were working on their very own mobile payment solution, rather than relying on other popular concepts. Walmart Pay, as this mobile payment tool will be called, is a proprietary system that can only be used within the chain\u2019s stores itself. The initial rollout of Walmart Pay will be very localised as Arkansas customers will be the first to get their hands on this new solution. Owners of either Android or iOS devices will be able to install and use Walmart Pay from day one, and a lot of major debit and credit cards will be supported at launch. One of the major downsides of most mobile payment solutions is how they only work with a few devices. Walmart Pay will not suffer from that drawback, as the application has been designed specifically to be compatible with nearly any smartphone in existence. But that is not all, as Walmart Pay leaves the door open for future integration with other mobile wallets in the future. It is important to keep in mind that Walmart is still working with a consortium of retailers backing the CurrentC project. Merchant Customer Exchange \u2013 or MCX \u2013 is the overarching body of this mobile payment solution, which aims to create a unified mobile payment solution for major retailers, including Target, Walmart, and Lowe\u2019s. While it is still too early to tell whether or not Walmart Pay will turn out to be a major success, remains to be seen. That being said, the concept of possible integration with another mobile wallet opens up interesting possibilities, even for Bitcoin users. Unlike any other mobile payment solution linked to traditional financial tools, Bitcoin can be used on nearly any device without requiring a plastic card or bank account. Additionally, Bitcoin integration could prove to be quite beneficial to tourists and foreign visitors shopping at Walmart during their stay. Rather than using cash, or their international plastic card, they could just use Bitcoin, which effectively acts as a global currency. Plus, there would be far fewer transaction costs involved for both Walmart and the customer.

As I mentioned in my last Bitcoin technical analysis article: the price band between $385-$390 is one giant resistance zone. The $385 area has been used several times as support/resistance in the past three days, so this level might provide some support in the event of another break down.

But that was never the intended goal to begin with. Integrating such a powerful and energy-efficient mining chip into a device as small as the Bitcoin Miner provides interesting opportunities. This is a clear example of how Bitcoin mining chips can, in theory, be embedded into any type of device in the future, no matter how big or small they are. Additionally, this will help get Bitcoin in the hands of everyday consumers without verification processed to wade through. Bitcoin Computer owners provide consumers with a way to generate Bitcoin while spending very little on maintenance costs when running the device itself. That being said, many people still see the US$399 price tag as a major hurdle to overcome. This all depends on how one looks at the device, as they will never earn the investment back from mining alone. In fact, the 21 Inc Bitcoin Computer is not even a consumer device, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be used by novice users. Consumers looking to experiment in the world of technology and development might find what they are looking for in the Bitcoin Computer.

However, in order to achieve such a feat of strength, proper guidelines will have to be drafted and the economy needs to be relatively stable. Finland seems to have all of their ducks in a row, as the idea of giving every citizen 800 EUR per month is starting to take shape. Also read: No Bitcoins Were Stolen Before Dorkbot Botnet Was Shut Down It is important to note this new tax-free income would replace any and all additional benefits programs running in Finland. However, there is a major interesting twist to this proposal, as the sum of 800 euro would be paid to all adults, regardless of whether they have any other income. This means that even employed people will receive the bonus every month, with no questions asked. This decision comes at a time during which unemployment numbers in Finland are through the roof. However, by creating this new basic income in a tax-free fashion, more people should be stimulated to go back to work, as they will continue to receive the additional money. Plus, surviving on 800 EUR per month in Finland is next to impossible. The current state of unemployment benefits in Finland is so strange that unemployed people would earn less money by working a temporary job. Even though that situation is not just present in Finland, it is a worrying trend that needs to be rectified sooner or later. Introducing a tax-free basic income for every adult seems to be the right way forward. Unemployment numbers are currently qt 10% of Finland\u2019s total population, and especially younger workers are hit hard in the job sector. According to statistics provided by Telegraph UK, 22.7% of the younger generation is sitting at home unemployed, which is absolutely unacceptable. However, introducing a tax-free basic income can not happen if the country\u2019s population does not agree. this is where things get really interesting, as 6 in 10 fins seem to be in favor of this idea. As you would come to expect, there are always people who think this incentive undermines the whole concept of finding a job altogether. Then again, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time such a project turns out to be a major success. However, there is never a perfect solution that will be able to achieve all of the predetermined goals. In addition, this project would cost the country 46.7 billion EUR on a yearly basis, which would a somewhat competitive number compared to how much unemployment benefits are costing right now. Things would get really interesting if any country in the world decided to pay out a basic income in Bitcoin. Whether or not that country will be Finland, remains to be seen, although the chances are fairly slim. However, it would create an interesting scenario, as Bitcoin doesn\u2019t have a fixed value, and it would be more of an investment for the country in question. Bitcoin offers accountability like no other currency in the world today, and it can prove to be a valuable ally when it comes to using basic incomes in any country. Additionally,, the Bitcoin model could be adopted in any country, as the digital currency is universal and not restricted by banks or country borders.

Even in the Bitcoin world, there are programs at your disposal to help you with the accounting part of finance. In fact, there are more options available than most people know of. Also read: CoinJar Adds POLi Deposit Option for Bitcoin Purchases Some people in the Bitcoin community live on Bitcoin wages, and try to steer away from fiat currency as far as possible. From a taxation and accounting perspective, this can prove to be quite a hassle, as looking up every individual transaction is a pain in the rear. Luckily for all of us, there are certain software-based solutions to aid in the process. Libratax is properly the most well-known accounting software in the world of Bitcoin today. At the time of publication, the Libratax website was down due to a database error, and there was no word as to when the page would be accessible once again. However, the demo website is online, What makes Libratax so appealing is how it connects directly to the Bitcoin and looks at every single transaction made to and from your Bitcoin address. Reports are created in a spreadsheet format, covering balance tracking, gains and losses per transaction, and much more. Last but not least, Libratax supports tax form support [for US customers]. Intuit/QuickBooks is another solution to make Bitcoin accounting easier and more accessible to novice users. Not only can this tool generate invoices for potential customers \u2013 in Bitcoin \u2013 assuming the customer is a Quickbooks Online service user. As this tool automatically generates the necessary invoices, it becomes much easier to track incoming Bitcoin payments. The final option \u2013 at this time \u2013 is Coinbase integration with Mint.com. By integrating Mint with Coinbase, users gain valuable insights into how their financial situation is and has been in the past. Additionally, tracking all Bitcoins in your possession \u2013 when using a Coinbase wallet at least \u2013 will be done automatically. Budgetary tools like Mint.com will become more and more important as Bitcoin adoption thrives around the world. Similar to how regular finance works, consumers need to be able to set up a weekly or monthly budget. Plus, some businesses need convenient tools to pay their staff in Bitcoin, which is where Mint.com can play a major role. For the time being, the number of Bitcoin accounting tools is still fairly limited. Quickbooks seems to be the most logical solution, together with Libratax. Bitcoin users who do not own a Coinbase account cannot use the Mint.com integration, greatly reducing their choice as far as accounting goes. More competition in this segment wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing at all. Consumers want and deserve multiple options at their disposal, and as the Bitcoin ecosystem grows, more competition will be needed. With pending regulatory measures for Bitcoin all over the world, taxation could become a major trend, and proper accounting tools will become mandatory.

But to make bitcoin more convenient for the everyday user, a lot has to happen. Creating an option for users to split the bill when going out for food, or drinks, is an important step towards making Bitcoin more appealing. Also read: The World Needs More Bitcoin Accounting Solutions There are several payment systems in existence that already allow users to split a bill in a convenient way. Venmo is one of those services that only requires a name \u2013 through a Facebook contact, for example \u2013 to send money to someone else. There is no email address, phone number, or even address linked to the recipient. For privacy centric people, Venmo seems to make a lot of sense, as a name alone doesn\u2019t tell one much about somebody\u2019s identity. Papa John\u2019s has seen the value in payment systems like Venmo, and introduced a concept of their own, called PayShare. As the name suggests, anyone can pitch in on the pizza. Customers can come in as a group \u2013 small or large \u2013 and place their order at the Papa John\u2019s restaurant of their choice. Once the order is placed, and the payment page comes up, there will be an option called \u201cPayShare\u201d. This is where users can then split the bill, either by letting everyone pay their share, or just dividing the total amount into equal values. The person paying the order in full is responsible for selecting the friends they want to split the bill with, and will still have to pay the full amount upfront. However, that person\u2019s friends will be notified immediately about the payment, and be sent a notice containing the amount they owe the person who paid for the pizza. All the friends have to do is hit \u201cAccept\u201d, and the funds will be deducted from their account. Venmo offers a wide variety of payment methods, including bank accounts, debit cards, and credit cards. As receiving funds through Venmo is completely free of charge, it has become quite a popular payment solution among millennials. Plus, creating an account is quick, as all it takes is a username and password, as well as some personal info to receive payments. The world of Bitcoin and digital currencies could do with a bill-sharing solution such as Venmo-powered PayShare. While it is quite easy for individual Bitcoin users to quickly generate QR codes for a certain amount of money on their mobile devices, it\u2019s not user-friendly when one is a novice user. Consumers want convenient payment methods, and letting other people scan a QR code to make their individual payments is not all that convenient. Receiving a notification regarding how much they are due, which will then open their Bitcoin wallet to send the funds, would be a more favorable solution.

A typical botnet will comprise of a few ten thousand computers, but in some cases, they are much larger. Take the Dorkbot botnet, for example, which consisted of over 100,000 computers spread over 190 countries. Luckily for all of us, Dorkbot has been taken down by law enforcement and Microsoft. Also read: The World Needs More Bitcoin Accounting Solutions Taking down a huge botnet is not an easy task, as it involves quite a bit of manpower. In the case of Dorkbot, law enforcement teamed up with Microsoft and the FBI to take down the humongous botnet. Keeping in mind the botnet was spread out over 190 countries, and ranks had swelled to over 100,000 computers being used for illegal purposes, it was about time Dorkbot came to an end. There is no limit as to what a decent-sized botnet can achieve. Examples range from sending out spam emails to executing denial-of-service attacks against websites, or even stealing sensitive personal information. As you would come to expect from such a wide variety of nefarious activities, stealing financial information was one of the top priorities. It should come as no surprise to find out Dorkbot was targeting sites like Netflix, PayPal, Twitter, and Facebook in particular. While not every country in the world has financial information linked to these services, the platforms in questions have very large user bases, making them a prime target for hackers. In fact, the Dorkbot botnet has been around for quite some time, as law enforcement has been trying to shut down the network since April of 2011. After four and a half years, the deal has finally been sealed, and Dorkbot is no more. But that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t other botnets waiting to take its place. Windows computers remain the most vulnerable to malware attacks, turning computers into part of the \u201cbotnet crew\u201d. The reason for this is quite simple: Windows is the most popular operating system in the world. Thanks to a helping hand from Microsoft\u2019s engineers, these infections can be removed in due course. At the time of publication, no information was revealed as to how much -or how little \u2013 financial information was exposed as part of the Dorkbot botnet. What we do know is how the botnet infected over one million Windows computers over the past 12 months alone, so chances are real at last some information was leaked along the way. Bitcoin users are not safe from botnets like Dorkbot either unless they have encrypted their wallet. Every Bitcoin wallet has a specific data file containing the address and private keys, which can be imported into any Bitcoin wallet on any computer. But if password encryption is enabled, importing the file becomes useless, unless the password is cracked. Have you ever been infected by a botnet? Let us know in the comments below!

Deposits of up to AU$500 will be processed instantly, whereas higher amounts will still take 1-2 business days to clear. POLi makes it more convenient for novice users to buy their digital currency, as most of them will do so in smaller quantities. POLi is an online payment option that is specifically tailored to facilitating internet banking payments to a merchant.

As part of the payment process, users will be able to log into their online banking account, and complete the payment. Depending on the amount they are planning to spend, it will either be instant or take 1-2 business days. The best part about POLi is how there are no additional fees associated with the process. Without online banking, it would take up to a week \u2013 or longer \u2013 for Bitcoin purchase deposits to clear. In this regard, modern banking services, such as POLi or SOFORT, are quite beneficial to the world of Bitcoin.

Also read: Goldman Sachs develops its own cryptocurrency, for stock trading When stories like these break, it is important to take some things into consideration. Based on all of Earth\u2019s economies, there are huge gaps between the value of certain countries, compared to others. For example, Costa Rica\u2019s value is currently quite low, so it makes them prone to being overshadowed by a giant company like Uber. That being said, Costa Rica isn\u2019t the only economy that is being overshadowed by the current valuation of Uber. According to the latest reports, the car sharing company\u2019s value will surpass the US$62.5 billion mark soon, making it more valuable than over 60 percent of the world\u2019s nations. To put this into some numbers everyone can understand, 120 out of a total 194 countries tracked by the World Bank\u2019s data on GDP are valuated below Uber\u2019s threshold. Oddly enough, Uber only just outranks Kenya, albeit that is a country housing more than 45 million people. Considering how Uber was founded only six years ago, it is safe to say the company has seen an astonishing growth. Especially considering no one gave the concept of car sharing any chance of success. However, Uber has become part of everyday life in hundreds of cities around the world and is active in over 50 countries around the world at the time of publication. Do keep in mind the US$62.5 billion valuation is just a rumour and not an official confirmation at this time. In the end, Uber\u2019s valuation could be much lower, or even higher than currently anticipated. Compared to an electronics giant like Apple, Uber isn\u2019t even worth 10% of that company\u2019s value. While Uber is disrupting the world of car ownership as we know it, the battle for dominance in the financial sector is still in full swing. There are multiple players involved, although most of them rely on existing traditional financial infrastructure. Bitcoin, on the other hand, offers something else entirely. When it comes to using a global currency, there is no option but Bitcoin to transfer value around the world in mere seconds without filling in tons of paperwork. It will be interesting to see how the future of finance will play, but one can rest assured Bitcoin will be part of it, in some shape or form.

However, that process has turned out to be quite difficult in some cases, especially when it comes to getting novice users to buy their first Bitcoin amount. Exchanges require document verification and ATMs are sparsely located. Is there a good way to convert people to Bitcoin? Also read: Restricted WeChat Pay Expansion Shows Off Bitcoin\u2019s Strengths Buying Bitcoin from a digital currency exchange platform sounds easy on paper, but the process can turn out to be more complicated than most people bargained for. Creating an account is the easy part, but when it comes to verifying one\u2019s identity, things become vastly different and increasingly difficult. Depending on which Bitcoin exchange is being used, they might offer an instant verification procedure. To complete this process, a user will have to scan their government-issued ID or driver\u2019s license with their webcam. Unfortunately, it has proven to be quite the hassle to get a clear image of that ID when using a webcam in most cases. Despite the advancements made in the field of technology, capturing clear images of sensitive information through a webcam can still prove to be very difficult. Some people might see this as a positive thing as it will eliminate the possibility of personal information being stolen by hackers accessing one\u2019s webcam. On the other hand, this also causes a lot of frustration for novice users looking to venture into the world of Bitcoin and digital currency. In fact, according to one Reddit post earlier today, people are more likely to give up once this process fails. Even when incentives are offered, there is only so much frustration a person can take. Something has to change in this regard, as the verification procedure will need to be simplified if we want to grow the Bitcoin ecosystem. Instant verification procedures are a major step forward in making the process more accessible for novice users, but there are still bottlenecks for less tech-savvy users. This is why projects working on implementing blockchain technology as a way to authenticate and verify a user\u2019s identity are so important. That being said, it will probably take a few more years until this platforms come to fruition and can be used by mainstream consumers. One other thing to take into consideration is whether or not everyday consumers want to obtain Bitcoin in the first place. Putting people through a frustrating verification process when they are not sure as to whether or not they want to buy Bitcoin is not the best approach. Granted, it is important to grow the community, but there is no need to \u201cpush\u201d people over the edge. Perhaps the easiest way to \u201cguide\u201d people in the right direction is by handing them a paper wallet with a tiny amount of Bitcoin. No one is saying you have to give away a half a Bitcoin to random people on the street. Start with your friends, family, and loved ones.

As our society slowly embraces the digital lifestyle, there will be a huge demand for people with some coding skills. But even those among us who have no idea where to begin, can find a helping hand. Applop allows just about anyone to make an application in a few minutes and get it launched within 12 hours. Also read: CoinJar Adds POLi Deposit Option for Bitcoin Purchases Having services like Applop at our disposal is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it will cost far less time and effort to get a mobile app created, which can be quite beneficial to retailers and various companies. On the other hand, there is the topic of app security to keep in mind, as you never know what type of backdoors might be part of the application. According to the Applop Google Play Store page, this tool is specifically tailored to those looking to target a market that loves to stay connected, Whether you are a retailer, startup, educational institute, or even organizer, Applop might be an interesting solution to suit your needs. So far, nine user reviews have been received, of which two rate it at one star [without further explanation as to why]. But there is more positive news, as Applop has become a part of the GHV business accelerator for the coming 12 months. Also, the startup will receive US$100,000 in funding; as part of GHV\u2019s plan to add ten startups to their portfolio by March of next year. Whether or not the world needs even more fractured mobile applications, is a different matter, though. \u201cWhat the dotcom was to the PC era, apps will be for today\u2019s smartphone era. Herein lies the potential of Applop. Applop is in fact the logical next step after the internet boom, given the exponential \u2018need\u2019 of apps owing to better smartphone and internet penetration.\u201d \u2013 GHV Chief Mentor Vikram Upadhyaya stated. There is one thing that makes Applop quite appealing, even to experienced app developers. Rather than maintaining the app code for other clients, Applop gives all of their users the ability to maintain everything themselves. In fact, Applop users can start their mobile commerce store through the app and integrate various gateways. Depending on how limited access to maintaining the mobile application itself, Bitcoin companies and entrepreneurs might take an interest in the service provider by Applop. Building applications for the Bitcoin ecosystem is important, although it\u2019s uncertain as to whether or not Applop will be a suitable solution. Price-wise, the Applop solution is incredibly cost-effective, compared to developing something in-house; Unless the business owner is a developer, it will be mandatory to hire an additional coder, and they usually don\u2019t come cheap. By using Applop\u2019s solution, business owners will pay US$14 per month for development and maintenance of their mobile application. What are your thoughts on Applop?

Unfortunately, there is a high fee associated with Bitcoin ATM transactions, which can be as high as 7% or more. But even regular bank ATMs are suffering from high fees and a solution has to be found to reduce these charges. Also read: Buy Bitcoin From 13,000 Retail Locations With LibertyX There is one major difference between Bitcoin ATMs and regular bank ATMs. The former is completely transparent regarding fees, as well as how much value for their money customers will get at that exact time. The latter, on the other hand, are known for charging hidden fees, which will only be visible on a bank statement at the end of the month. But there are also parallels between both types of ATMs, as it will heavily depend on which machine one uses to find lower fees. Bitcoin ATMs owned and operated by manufacturers are \u2013 in some cases \u2013 subject to lower exchange fees, compared to machines operated by a third party. Depending on where the ATMs are located, there can be a fee discrepancy of 2% or more. Bank ATMs suffer from the same issue, though, as proprietary ATMs will either charge no fees or a lower fee compared to machines belonging to other operators. That being said, national ATMs \u2013 which are linked to networks such as Cirrus, for example \u2013 will usually charge the highest fees per transaction. In some cases, these fees can amount to double the regular charge. A little-known fact is how various banks around the world are adding their own type of charge on top of the regular ATM transaction fee. Especially where foreign transactions are concerned \u2013 which are costly enough as it is \u2013 these fees can amount to quite a lot of money if these devices are frequently used. Luckily for everybody involved, there are ways to reduce ATM fees as well. Doing research on which [Bitcoin] ATM charges the lowest fees at any given time, and use that device, even if it\u2019s further away. While this may not be the most convenient solution, it will save you money in the end. Secondly, try to make large transactions rather than completing multiple small transactions. This is especially true for Bitcoin ATMs, as a fee of 5% or more can add up quickly when it has to be paid several times. Besides ATM fees are changing on a regular basis, both for bank and Bitcoin ATMs. At the time of publication, the average Bitcoin ATM fee sits at 6.46% per transaction. Do keep in mind this number is calculated based on 489 Bitcoin ATMs around the world. Individual ATM fees may be lower or higher in your region, and are dependant on whether you\u2019re buying or sell BTC.

While various Bitcoin companies are trying to gain a foothold in the market, BlackBerry will be bringing the BMM Mobile payments to Nigeria. Also read: You Can Lower Your Bitcoin ATM Fees The lack of financial services in Nigeria and other African countries make them perfect for disruption, especially as far as mobile payments are concerned. BlackBerry is determined to play a role of importance in this segment as far as Nigeria is concerned by allowing users to transfer funds using the BBM messaging service. In fact, BlackBerry is \u2013 allegedly \u2013 seeing quite a positive response and growth in Africa. This is in stark contrast to the company\u2019s struggles in the Western World, where both iOS and Android are dominating. According to the information we have received, there are over 22 million registered BBM users in all of Africa and they combine for a total of 380 million messages on a daily basis. One thing African citizens have no shortage of is mobile devices. Most people on the continent own at least one mobile device, making the continent a prime market for mobile payments. Due to the lack of financial services, countries like Nigeria might transition from cash into mobile payments and skip the \u201ctraditional financing\u201d step altogether. BlackBerry has partnered with local payment processor Interswitch to allow users to transfer funds by using the BBM messaging service. In addition, they can use the same platform to transfer airtime to other users. By making mobile payments as easy as sending a photo to another user, BlackBerry is on the right track to becoming a major player in the market. But that is not all, as an addition has been made to the BBM Shop payment option. Firstmonie, the mobile wallet of First Bank of Nigeria, has partnered with BlackBerry to make this venture a success. Furthermore, BlackBerry is already working on a deal to expand the service to South Africa as well. Bitcoin payments could become a major factor in the African mobile payment ecosystem as well. Facing competition from BlackBerry is both good and bad at the same time. On the one hand, it will help boost mobile payments on the continent in general, from which Bitcoin can benefit as well in the long run. On the other hand, it may draw some of the attention away from Bitcoin, which would be less beneficial. However, the mobile market ecosystem is heating up in Africa, and will only be a matter of time until people start to see the value Bitcoin can offer them in a convenient and frictionless manner.

Despite all signs pointing to an upcoming crash post the black friday hype, the honey badger didn\u2019t sleep However, today the honey badger finally fell asleep as the unwinding of the week long rally up to a high of $383 came to an end. Earlier this month, after the bull run to $500, bitcoin settled at $380 for a week. A painful drop came next which brought the price down over 20%. As if the traders didn\u2019t have enough action, a few bull traps came along. Finally, a stable rally began on November 25th, which as expected, exhibited the most trading volume on black friday. It all came to an end today as waves after waves of sells dominated the market. Currently the price is looking to stabilize at a new area which looks like its going to be in the $355 range. Because we had some major volume right at the $350 area previously, we can deduce that it can serve as a good support zone for the possibly upcoming Christmas / New Years shopping hype. Many agree that the long term market is bullish and as the halving is approaching in march the price should slowly climb.

While most of the Bitcoin\u2019s are either bought in a peer-to-peer fashion or from an exchange, alternatives are slowly making a name for themselves. LibertyX is one of those alternative options, through which buying Bitcoin in-store becomes an appealing option. Also read: SEC Files Charges Against Joshua Garza, GAW Miners and ZenMiner The process of buying Bitcoin through LibertyX is vastly different from regular offerings in the world today. Rather than buying Bitcoin from a Bitcoin exchange \u2013 and going through a lengthy verification procedure \u2013 consumers can buy Bitcoin directly from retail stores. Some of those stores allow the purchase of any amount, whereas others offer only PIN denominations. Making Bitcoin more accessible to consumers has to be achieved in such a way that fraud becomes a non-issue. In the case of LibertyX, this means there are no other payment options available other than cash. Various customers have been inquiring about credit and debit card payments, but due to their high fees and high fraud rates, this type of payment is not [yet] possible. There is one major factor to keep in mind when purchasing Bitcoin from LibertyX \u2013 either a PIN-denominated amount or otherwise \u2013 and that is how customers only have 24 hours to provide a Bitcoin address. Failure to do so will result in an expired payment for Bitcoin, and a new order will have to be placed through the mobile app. Once customers provide their designated Bitcoin wallet address, LibertyX will immediately send the amount in BTC. This can easily be tracked on the Bitcoin blockchain, and transactions should be visible shortly after making the cash payment. Using the mobile-friendly website or designed applications \u2013 for both iOS and Android \u2013 will help keep track of incoming Bitcoin transactions. As you may have guessed by now, one can not simply buy unlimited amounts of Bitcoin from LibertyX. Depending on the verification level for each user, their daily purchase limit ranges from US$100 to US$1,000. Furthermore, the number of PINs to redeem within 24 hours is limited to four. LibertyX is currently looking into ways to increase the limits. Unfortunately for international customers, the service offered by LibertyX is only available in the United States and Guernsey for now. At the time of publication, the LibertyX service was available across 38 US states. However, this service might expand to an area near you. In fact, according to a recent Twitter post by LibertyX, they have added 6,000 additional locations to purchase Bitcoin with cash. This is a positive trend for Bitcoin adoption in general, as more consumers will have easier access to purchasing digital currency without too much hassle.

As mentioned in one of our articles yesterday, ATM fees can be determining factor as to whether or not use a specific machine compared to others. Overall, the users seemed to enjoy the experience quite a bit, despite paying a hefty premium price for Bitcoin. Also read: Can Bitcoin Benefit From BlackBerry\u2019s Mobile Payment Success In Nigeria? As is the case with most Bitcoin ATMs, the location of the device is a key element to attract potential customers. The Naperville Red Leaf Bitcoin ATM is a two-way machine, which lets users buy and sell Bitcoin in exchange for fiat currency. Completing this process can be done seven days a week, between 7:30 AM and 12:00 AM. Considering how the Bitcoin ATM is located inside an office building, the location seems to be aptly chosen. Offices always draw a large crowd during the day and not having the machine in the open will reduce the chances of it being stolen or damaged. Accessing the machine requires customers to pass through the \u201cVan Buren Place\u201d lobby. The Reddit user agreed this location is aptly chosen for a Red Leaf Bitcoin ATM, seeing as though the spot is in a busy suburban downtown location. Additionally, there is free parking nearby, which is a major bonus. Traffic congestion could be a small negative aspect, but that is just the way of life in cities like Naperville these days. This brings us to perhaps the most important aspect of the Red Leaf Bitcoin ATM and that is the price for purchasing digital currency. According to the Reddit post, the user bought Bitcoin at an exchange rate that was US$37 per BTC higher compared to the average price across major exchanges at that time. This comes down to a whopping 10% premium price per Bitcoin purchased, which is quite a high fee. In the ATM fee article yesterday, we mentioned how it is possible to lower fees when conducting transactions. Especially when it comes to these types of fees of 10% and more, it is pertinent to make as few transactions as possible. That is exactly what the Reddit user did, as he purchased the equivalent of just under US$1,000 in BTC in one go. Every Bitcoin ATM has its own verification procedure when purchasing larger amounts of digital currency. For the Red Leaf Bitcoin ATM in Naperville, two-factor authentication through a mobile phone number, combined with a scan of a government-issued ID is sufficient when purchasing less than US$1,000. The only major downside to this Red Leaf Bitcoin ATM \u2013 other than the incredibly high fees \u2013 is how the feeder compartment of the device is rather confusing. There are various slots above and below the feeder itself, and dropping bills into those would not result in anything other than losing money. This small design flaw will be addressed sooner or later hopefully.

The area also acted as support yesterday, so this level is of technical significance. Seeing as the market is now approaching this area from underneath, it seem likely that this level may now act as resistance again. If the market uses $369 as resistance and continues to drop over the next few days, the $353 pivot area may come into play again. The $369 area has acted as support about four times in the past few days, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the market respects this pivot area again.

Things have gotten so much out of hand that we can call the current ecosystem \u201capp-fatigued\u201d. Every little action or service requires its own proprietary application and consumers are getting tired of cumbersome solutions. Most smartphone users would prefer to stick to one application that can fit all of their needs.

One should not think of this concept as a way to replace mobile apps, but more as a logical evolution of technology and the Internet of things. Consumers will keep using smartphones and tablets for a long time to come, and applications will always be available. However, for developers, the game will be changing, as they can start creating a single-codebase web portal through which apps and smart agents can gather information and communicate with the user. It\u2019s difficult to gauge the impact of virtual agents on the Bitcoin ecosystem. Up until this point, most Bitcoin users are relying on websites or individual applications to find the information they need at that time. Creating a consolidated platform through which all of this information can flow freely could make Bitcoin more approachable by mainstream consumers. Artificial intelligence and virtual agents will make everyday life a whole lot more interesting to say the least. Even though most consumers are steering away from human interaction wherever possible, a smart agent would provide a similar experience without the human element. Whether or not that will impact Bitcoin in a positive or negative manner remains to be seen. Images credit 1,2,3", "date": "2015-11-29T20:47:00+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 29}

More and more consumers \u2013 as well as merchants and retailers \u2013 want to steer away from using cash to pay for goods and services. WeChat is on the right track, as the popular Chinese messaging application extended their cashless payment option overseas. More cashless payment options open up opportunities for Bitcoin payments as well. Also read: BlackBerry Exits Pakistan Over Privacy Demands \u2013 Blockchain Technology Can Help China\u2019s popular messaging application WeChat has become so much more than just a platform to communicate with other people. In recent months, WeChat has ventured into the mobile payment system by launching WeChat Pay. This system can be compared to competitors like Apple Pay and the upcoming LG Pay. The main goal of WeChat Pay is to allow for financial transactions without making the user experience too cumbersome. Especially when it comes to sending money overseas, traditional remittance solutions are quite a hassle, and expensive to boot. WeChat Pay makes it easy to send funds to friends and family, although there is much more to the service than just that. Up until this point, WeChat Pay was exclusively available to Chinese residents, who can use contactless payments in hundreds of stores across the country. But Tencent, the parent company of WeChat, is not satisfied with becoming a major player in China, as they want to offer the same functionality all over the world. Achieving that goal is easier said than done, as every individual country has its own restrictions and regulations as far as mobile payments are concerned. This is why WeChat Pay will support nine currencies in the future \u2013 ranging from the USD to Euro and Korean Won to Australian Dollar \u2013 although payments will be restricted to China-issued bank and credit cards for the time being. One benefit from this decision is how Chinese tourists will be able to pay wherever contactless payments are accepted, without having to leave the trusted WeChat ecosystem. Any overseas expenses paid through WeChat Pay will be converted to and paid for in Chinese renminbi. At this time, there was no official statement regarding support for international bank and credit cards. Last but not least, it remains up to the overseas retailer to enable WeChat Pay for foreign customers. It is hard to judge the impact of this news on the market, even though there are 650 million active users on the WeChat platform. Getting those premium tourist locations on board will be critical to making this mobile payment solution an overseas success. Any player active in the mobile payments market will have to come up with creative ways to make their app appealing to consumers all over the world. Bitcoin is the only currency that can be used on a global level, without agreements from banks or third-party services. In fact, Bitcoin is a much cheaper solution for both consumer and retailers alike. Accepting contactless payments requires the retailer to set up additional infrastructure, which can be quite expensive if the transaction volume is insufficient.Bitcoin payments, on the other hand, require an internet connection and a device with a screen, which can even be a computer. More importantly, Bitcoin transactions clear within seconds, whereas card and contactless payments take 30 days to be credited to a bank account.

In fact, recent reports indicate that hackers have attacked three Greek banks for the third time, in a total of five days. According to Greek police and the Greek Central Bank, it seems like the ransom demanded from each bank was of 20,000 bitcoin, which translates to roughly $7.2 million. The group, which refers to itself by the name of Armada Collective, staged their first attacks last Thursday. At that moment in time, they warned the institutions that a full collapse of Greek bank websites would be imminent if the ransoms weren\u2019t paid up. Based on this, the initial attacks were structured in the form of DDOS hits, thus flooding the websites with too many requests, hence brining the websites down. When they did this, they managed to disrupt electronic transactions for all three banks for a period of time, but no customer information has been affected. As the three banks refused to pay up, the hackers went ahead and attacked once again. Only this time, the banks had strengthened their defence, so thanks to this, no actual disruptions of service took place. The banks have gotten in touch with the authorities, which are now investigating the case, and trying to find the hackers responsible for this. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, what do you personally think about the recent spark in bitcoin ransom attacks? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below.

In the current traditional financial world, sending money across country borders is proving to be quite a challenge. The European Payments Council showcased their proposal for a pan-European instant credit transfer scheme for the SEPA zone. Also read: Interview with Alex Sunnarborg founder of Lawnmower.io Despite best efforts by the European Union to create the illusion of forming a united front, things are vastly different when it comes to financial matters. On the one hand, there is the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) where users can send bank transfers to each other in a matter of mere minutes. From a convenience point of view, this is a major improvement compared to waiting for a handful of days for funds to clear. But at the same time, the SEPA zone only represents a fraction of Europe and a lot of countries do not have access to this instant bank transfer scheme. In the United Kingdom, for example, there is a separate project called Faster Payments, which promises to clear payments immediately between parties. Even though the United Kingdom is \u201cattached\u201d to the European Union, they do not use the Euro, nor do they have access to the SEPA scheme. This creates a very fractured financial ecosystem where various payment methods are competing with each other instead of communicating to create an improved user experience. The proposals by the European Payments Council would alleviate some of these worries, as it would create a credit transfer payment instrument \u2013 denominated in Euro \u2013 for the 34 SEPA countries. But there are several issues that still need to be addressed, as the transfers are not as fast as they could be in their current form. But that is not the only concern, as the third-party clearing and settlement agencies will need to approve this proposal as well. Faster transfers would mean more work for those parties while having less opportunity to scalp some interest from holding on to the funds. If everything goes according to plan, a result can be expected by November 2016. While the efforts made by the European Payments Council can only be deemed commendable, it is not addressing any of the main issues plaguing the global financial ecosystem. There is no simple payment solution across continents unless consumers are comfortable with paying exchange rate fees for every small transaction. Bitcoin, despite not being embraced by a mainstream audience just yet, does not suffer from any of these issues. Unlike traditional payment options, Bitcoin is a universal, borderless and frictionless payment method with instant transactions at minimal costs. Additionally, Bitcoin can be converted to nearly any local currency in the world without too much effort. There are many advantages to Bitcoin compared to the proposal outlined by the European Payments Council. With no need to rely on third parties to settle and clear transactions, and being available throughout the entire world, Bitcoin is clearly a superior payment system. It is only a matter of time until the general population recognizes that fact. Source: Finextra Images credit 1,2,3", "date": "2015-11-30T08:51:28+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 11, "day": 30}

As more and more everyday consumers are transitioning into the Digital Age, more and more aspects of life will become digitized as well. But Metro Bank is playing a bit too aggressive, as they refused one customer\u2019s savings account application because he doesn\u2019t want to disclose his mobile phone number. Also read: ATM Skimming Worries SEPA Zone \u2013 Time For Bitcoin? A lot of people on this planet were more than happy to embrace online banking when it was first announced. After all, visiting a local bank branch office to wire funds from your account to a different account was getting a bit silly. Ever since that point, bank customers have been able to wire funds around the world from the comfort of their own home. Despite promises from both bigger and smaller banks to offer their services to anyone with a valid application, that scenario no longer seems to be the case. Especially in the case of Metro Bank, who tout themselves as \u201cBritain\u2019s first new high street bank in over 100 years\u201d. That is, assuming the applicant wants to disclose their mobile phone number. In this day and age, showing a great desire to open a savings account with Metro bank isn\u2019t enough, not even if you are planning to put some money into their own bonds. Applications for a Metro Bank savings account can be done online, and that is exactly what 66-year old Mike Mace did. However, during the application process, he did not fill in a mobile phone number \u2013 despite owning one \u2013 for privacy reasons. Entering a dummy phone number bypassed the \u201csecurity check\u201d on the application form, and eventually, the Metro Bank savings account was opened without a hitch. Unfortunately, that success was not long-lived, as the account was blocked by Metro Bank shortly afterwards. The reason for this is simple: Metro Bank sent a security code to the mobile phone number provided during the online application, and without entering the code, the account would remain locked. The matter got sorted after weeks, and Metro Bank gave Mr. Mace \u00a375 in compensation for all of the trouble he went through. This is another clear example of how aggressive banks are acting these days, even though they will need every customer they can get if they want to stay in business a few decades from now. Unlike traditional financial institutions, Bitcoin provides financial services to anyone in the world, regardless of how much personal information they want to disclose. This is one of the main selling points for Bitcoin and digital currency, as it allows users to be pseudonymous, while ensuring all financial activity is publicly visible on the blockchain. Bitcoin can be used on computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and even minicomputers like a Raspberry Pi. Financial services belong to every citizen on this planet, and not just to those who are forced to play by the banks\u2019 rules. There is no better time than now to get involved with Bitcoin and digital currency.

Mining Bitcoin requires a certain base value of BTC for most miners, and even those who can keep mining costs low in general, need to find alternative solutions. Renewable energy can play an important role in the Bitcoin mining business over the next few years. Also read: Bitcoin Can Help ChargeBee Make E-Commerce Payments Easier It is no secret how the generation of electricity is slowly starting to drain the planet\u2019s resources. Renewable energy sources are becoming more and more popular, although setting up the wind- and water-based energy solutions is still a costly manner. But a recent report by Stanford researcher Mark Jacobson might change the way we think about renewable energy. Turning the entire United States into a 100% renewable energy grid \u2013 without relying on batteries- would not be an easy feat. Using wind turbines sounds like a valid idea on paper, yet the amount of machines needed would make hurricanes look like a minor breeze stroking your hair. Messing with Mother Earth\u2019s ecosystem is not always a good thing, but that doesn\u2019t mean there are no solutions. One of the main things to take into consideration is creating a stable grid to ensure all of the intermittent generators are up and running at optimal capacity on a 24/7 basis. Instead of looking at traditional solutions like fossil fuel or nuclear solutions, a combination of heat storage and hydrogen production would be sufficient to pull off this effort. Unlike what most people would assume, the generation of heat is quite important for electrical storage, and \u201cbanking\u201d additional energy resources is of great value to our society for the generations to come. Also, hydropower would act as an additional form of stored power, rather than just being a baseline power source. As utopian as these ideas sound, they are quite feasible in the long run, assuming things start to change sooner rather than later. Especially the concept of long-distance transmissions of electricity would have to be improved. On top of that, there would be a ton of new jobs waiting to be created in the build-out of renewable power sources. All of this can be achieved by 2050, and the fully renewable grid would become a superior economic model compared to the system being used today. However, analysts strongly feel the whole idea is not realistic by any means. At the same time, there are still a lot of interesting bits of information to keep in mind from this analysis. One of the many worrying things about Bitcoin mining is how the machines used to perform this task can generate quite a bit of heat. While some people use this heat to warm their houses in the winter, most of the energy generated is going to waste.Finding a way to harness that heat could be beneficial to the future of our planet, while putting Bitcoin mining a positive spotlight. But the biggest downside of Bitcoin mining is the sheer amount of electricity it requires. Mining at home has become all but impossible, except for residents of a handful of countries. Cheaper electricity solutions are beneficial to all of us, including Bitcoin miners. If the heat generated by this process could be given back to society for additional renewable energy, an interesting vicious circle could be created.

When the market encountered the $353 pivot for a third time on the 26th, it briefly traded above it for a few hours, but then quickly dropped back under $353. Although there wasn\u2019t enough buying momentum to really smash though this major pivot zone, price has slowly made its way above $353 over the last two days. This can be observed very clearly on the 1-hour chart, which shows that the market has now used $353 as support on three occasions in the past 24h. If price makes it back under $353 again, I think it is very likely that this level will turn into resistance, and price will most likely head south. Disclaimer: This is not trading/investment advice!

Regardless of how Bitcoin is perceived by mainstream media, there is no denying digital currency offers major advantages for online commerce. Also read: Bank of England Launches Blockchain Idea Prize Program As you might come to expect, the general consumer residing in the Middle East is fairly skeptical of Bitcoin and digital currency as a whole. However, there is a noticeable uptrend regarding people using Bitcoin in the region, with user numbers floating around 20,000. One of the main hurdles to overcome is convincing merchants to start accepting Bitcoin payments, though. Similar to how most people see Bitcoin, people living in the Middle East mainly use the popular digital currency as an investment vehicle for the future. There are several regular Bitcoin transactions taking place in the region as well, although most of those revolve around making payments to freelancers. The biggest market for Bitcoin as a usable currency in the Middle East comes in the form of using as a tool to bypass current remittance fees and restrictions in the region. Rather than relying on traditional payment methods for remittance purposes, Bitcoin is a far cheaper and faster alternative to transfer wealth around the world. Even though there is a handful of startups accepting Bitcoin payments in the Middle East, there is a huge potential waiting to be unlocked. Despite several warnings regarding the usage of digital currency, and several negative associations with underground marketplaces, Bitcoin has proven to be quite resistant. One of the companies actively working on Bitcoin adoption in the Middle East is Yellow; who operate as a Bitcoin payment processor. Up until this point, ten companies have been using the services offered by Yellow so far. While that number may seem low, there is a 300% growth compared to January of this year. Not unlike other countries, it is still rather difficult to access Bitcoin in the Middle East. Obtaining the digital currency is usually done through foreign exchanges, although BitOasis has been making a name for itself in Kuwait, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Qatar. It will be interesting to see how the Bitcoin situation will evolve in the Middle East To help put Bitcoin on the map, more educational efforts are needed/ In the Middle East, merchants need to be educated on why it is important for their business to accept Bitcoin payments, and how it can help them reach a global audience. Stressing the low transaction fees would be well worth mentioning too. Additionally, it is good to see Bitcoin is being used as an investment vehicle, although that only adds to the hoarding problem plaguing the digital currency.

Staying competitive can be achieved in multiple ways, including accepting new forms of payments. London black cab drivers may soon start to accept plastic cards and contactless payments to make the user experience more convenient. Also read: American Airlines No Longer Accepts Argentine Peso \u2013 Opportunity for Bitcoin Up until this point, paying the black cab driver in London had to be done in cash. It goes without saying that cash payments are not only quite annoying when people are in a hurry, but it also creates a security risk for both the customer and driver. Also, in this day and age, less and less people are using cash to begin with, and it was only a matter of time until alternative payment options were supported. Thanks to a deal between credit card companies and Transport for London, customers can now pay for a black cab ride with plastic cards and contactless payments. In fact, this decision follows on the heels of a public consultation regarding these payment methods, which saw an overwhelmingly positive response from consumers looking to ditch the cash payment method. As a result of this new deal, the payment processing fees for card payments made to cab drivers have been lowered. In the past, a card transaction would be subject to a fee equal to as much as 10% of the amount paid to the driver. That fee could be reduced drastically, although the price per black cab ride will increase by 20 pence, regardless of how they decide to pay. It will take some time until the new fares will go into effect, however, as the proposal has to be approved by the Transport for London Board in February of 2016. Assuming this motion will be approved, the fare change will take place as of April 2016. Paying with plastic cards and contactless payment options will be possible from October 2016. Another interesting result of this decision \u2013 assuming it gets approved next year \u2013 is how Bitcoin users will be able to pay for black cab rides in London. As the cabbies will be able to accept card payments, Bitcoin debit cards will be accepted as well, creating a very valuable use case scenario for the popular digital currency. One of the most often heard complaints is how Bitcoin can\u2019t be used for everyday purposes. Having the option to pay black cab rides in Bitcoin \u2013 albeit indirectly \u2013 would be a major feather in the cap for digital currency as a whole.

One of the most recent \u2013 and worrying \u2013 trends is the increase in skimming attacks on ATMs. Bitcoin ATMs, on the other hand, are not subject to these attacks, as there are no physical cards involved in the process. Also read: American Airlines No Longer Accepts Argentine Peso \u2013 Opportunity for Bitcoin The act of skimming ATMs is quite difficult to pull off, as it involves installing a separate card reader within the ATM itself. However, it looks like this type of attack has been evolving in recent months, as one European country reported the successful usage of a stereo-skimming device, which is a first for the SEPA zone. The recently released European Fraud Update for 2015 also mentions how a total of seventeen different countries reported acts of card skimming at ATMs. It goes without saying this is a very worrying trend, although card issuers are doing everything they can to reduce the chances of making an unauthorized payment after obtaining someone\u2019s card details. To make matters even worse, a total of 53 countries outside Single Euro Payments Area, as well as ten countries within the SEPA zone, reported losses due to skimming occurring outside of EMV chip liability. The United States reported the biggest losses, followed closely by The Philippines and Indonesia. But skimming attempts are not just targeting ATMs, as this type of attack is being made against other terminal types as well. A total of nine countries reported these incidents. One report even went as far as tracing the skimming attempts back to a terminal linked to docking stations for hiring bicycles. One trend that does seem to be going down is the malware attack against ATM devices. According to the latest report, only two countries reported this type of incident, but no word was given on how successful the attempts have been. Both countries making notice of malware attacks mentioned how the attempts were labeled as \u201ccash-out\u201d attacks. Reports like these clearly show how insecure card transactions still are to this very day, despite measures being taken by card issuers. There is very little that can be done to prevent card skimming, other than moving to a completely digital form of payments altogether. Various mobile payment solutions have been working on making card payments digital. However, that growth is hindered due to regulations, getting approval from banks, and gaining a critical user base. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is in a prime position to take over as the leading digital payment option in the world. Unlike plastic cards, Bitcoin can not be skimmed, as there is no physical payment method involved. Bitcoin payments are made in a digital form, and can be sent from any type of device to anyone in the world. Every transaction takes a few seconds to complete, and low transaction fees make Bitcoin far more superior compared to traditional payments.

For those who can not read between the lines: American Airlines is having issues when trying to convert Argentine Peso to US Dollar. Due to this decision, it is impossible to book any flight with Argentine Peso for the time being. However, American Airlines still accepts purchasing made by Argentinians using foreign credit cards denominated in a different fiat currency; It is no secret how the Argentine peso has been losing a lot of its value over the past years, and it looks like there is no improvement in sight anytime soon. Truth be told, this issue is not entirely American Airlines\u2019 fault either. The company is falling victim to several things going in Argentina itself, which is limiting any business manoeuvrability. With Argentina\u2019s central bank reducing the daily amount of money foreign companies can bring back to the US, there is very little room for major businesses to operate as normal. To make matters even worse, there are major changes coming to Argentina\u2019s currency. Now that a new President has been elected, major economic reforms have been announced. Among those reforms is ending the government\u2019s currency controls, which can turn out to be either positive or negative. Regardless of how the situation with the Argentine Peso plays out in the near future, this decision by American Airlines creates a major opportunity for Bitcoin. Accepting this disruptive digital currency would allow Argentinians to still book flights with American Airlines, regardless of whether they owned a foreign credit card or not. Obtaining such a credit card is quite a struggle in Argentina, as there are strong verification requirements before being granted this benefit. Additionally, most citizens in the country don\u2019t even have access to regular financial services, let alone obtaining foreign-based tools.

Kraken, a bitcoin exchange based in San Francisco, was under heavy DDoS attack yesterday, which rendered the exchange inaccessible for a short duration. An extortion letter was also sent to the exchange, demanding an undisclosed bitcoin ransom payment. Staff at Kraken have refused to comply with the demands. This is not the first time Kraken has been on the receiving end of these types of attacks. The exchange was under heavy DDoS attack at the end October as well. CryptoCoinsNews, a digital currency news publication, was targeted in an identical DDoS extortion attempt. The perpetrators demanded a 2 BTC payment within 24h, or else the ransom payment would be increased to 3 BTC and a bigger attack would follow. Bitcoin-related business are not the only ones being targeted. ProtonMail, an anonymous email provided based in Switzerland, was extorted out of 15 BTC earlier this month. The company paid the ransom in the hope that the sustained DDoS attacks would cease, but instead the attacks continued, and the data centers of their ISP were forced offline.

As many people are well aware of, the futures market are a great tool for speculation and Bitcoin price manipulation, making it one of the most successful services offered by any exchange. The question is: has this decision anything to do with US regulations, or is something else going on? Also read: Japanese Regulators Hold Meeting on Bitcoin Legislation Bitcoin exchanges from all over the world are very wary and careful when it comes to offering services and products to customers in the United States. Unlike most other countries in the world, the US is actively working on Bitcoin regulation, and the landscape can change at any given time. Should a drastic change occur, it will affect any and all Bitcoin exchange operators servicing US customers. Many companies feel it is not worth taking any risks over, and appropriate action needs to be taken. In the case of OKCoin, restricting Bitcoin futures trading for US customers seems to be what is going on right now. However, the way the company has gone about doing so is not sitting well with most customers, as the futures market has been locked out completely. US customers who attempt to access this part of the OKCoin platform are greeting with a prompt message stating: \u201cSorry, this function is not available to you due to regulation\u201d. OKCoin is not the first exchange to stop offering this type of functionality to US customers, as Bitmex is facing a similar struggle. Leveraged Bitcoin trading is -officially speaking \u2013 off-limits to US customers, although there are ways to circumvent this problem, according to the Reddit post. The decision made by OKCoin forced US Bitcoin traders to look for alternative options, of which there aren\u2019t too many available right now. 1Broker is the only platform that comes close to offering such a service, although the service is still in an experimental state. More of these platforms are needed for US traders sooner rather than later. Don\u2019t be mistaken in thinking the decision by OKCoin will have a major impact on the Bitcoin price anytime soon. Most of the trading volume is still originating from China, and they can dictate the price for quite some time to come. However, as US traders are left with little to no options to influence the price by themselves, a new paradigm could be created. It will be interesting to see how the ability to trade Bitcoin futures will evolve over the next few years. Regulatory efforts can help Bitcoin to gain a more legitimate appeal, but it also causes a fair bit of confusion and hassle for companies active in the space. Only time will tell where this market is headed. What are your thoughts on the decision made by OKCoin? Let us know in the comments below!

Most of the issues in this space can be attributed to reaching a global audience, and having to deal with different payment methods requiring currency conversions. Companies like ChargeBee are removing quite a few headaches in this regard, as they offer various tools to manage online subscriptions and recurring billings. Also read: Bitcoin Businesses Targeted in Wave of DDoS Extortion Attacks When looking at traditional payment options, such as card payments and bank transfers, there is no universal form of currency to boost e-commerce adoption on a worldwide scale. Every individual country has its own payment methods that may \u2013 or may not \u2013 work internationally. On top of that, when dealing with international customers, there are currency exchange rates to take into account. This is where companies like ChargeBee come in, as their goal is to make managing online subscriptions a lot easier for companies. Such a service is of great value to startups, as they are facing enough worries in the early stages. But what truly makes this company stand out is its ability to process international payments in a convenient manner. Due to the partnership between ChargeBee and Worldpay, integrated payment solutions have been made available to companies working with subscription billing. Customers can pay in their local currency, and ChargeBee will take care of the rest as they will process payments between different currencies without involving a bank. Venturing into the world of subscription billing is not a straightforward move for any startup these days. Even ChargeBee started out with a completely different business model; as their bread-and-butter used to be software-as-a-service. But it didn\u2019t take long to build something creative, and once ideas started falling into place, this new business model spawned from it. At the time of publication, ChargeBee staffs 52 employees, and more growth is expected over the next few years. One thing that could help the company reach an even bigger audience is if they were able to venture into the world of Bitcoin and digital currency. Unlike all of the different fiat currencies in existence, Bitcoin is the only global currency in the world that can be used to quickly transfer value across borders. Additionally, one Bitcoin in Africa is the same as one Bitcoin in Europe or the US, making it a perfect payment method for retailers and consumers all over the world.

However, as it turns out, the custom encryption and authentication layer was not as secure as originally assumed. A potential weakness has been identified in a code library protecting AWS, despite passing three different external penetration tests. Also read: 21 Bitcoin Computer Review Amazon\u2019s TLS implementation was originally designed to be a more secure and less complex form of encrypting and authenticating Web sessions. This implementation, called s2n, is based on the vast OpenSSL library while containing less than 10% of the number of code lines in the library itself. While this was originally touted as a key security feature, it turns out it could be the downfall of AWS; It took security researchers all of five days to discover the vulnerability in AWS\u2019 s2n, and a report was presented to Amazon engineers. As it turns out, a TLS attack unveiled back in 2013 \u2013 called \u201cLucky 13\u201d \u2013 can pose a serious threat to the cryptographic security layer protecting AWS. If an assailant were to pull off this Lucky 13 attack against AWS, they would be able to recover encrypted browser cookies used to access restricted parts of a website. Luckily for all parties involved, Amazon engineers were on the ball to address the situation, and the vulnerability was patched rather quickly. Even though this vulnerability is no longer a threat to this day, this story just goes to show how difficult it is to provide proper security layers. Even a company like Amazon, who can hire the best engineers and security experts in the world, can face major vulnerabilities when developing their security standard. There is nothing wrong with attempting to create a new implementation of an existing cryptographic security standard. Ensuring the entire layer is safe by conducting third-party audits and pen testing is the best approach to this concept. However, even those tests can fail to unveil a security threat. Even though most modern browsers and platforms are immune to Lucky 13 attacks to begin with, there is still a small portion of legacy systems that could pose a risk. Knowing that even companies like Amazon can turn out to be vulnerable to these types of attack poses a serious question for Bitcoin companies. As these platforms are involved in protecting customer details and funds, it is of the utmost important to ensure the platforms are as secure as they possibly can be. Most of the Bitcoin companies active today rely on cryptographic security, and this would be a good time to ensure their implementations are all working correctly and without flaws. Third-party audits are a good way to ensure security is working as intended, and we can only hope Bitcoin companies do everything they can to keep customer data and funds safe. What are your thoughts on the story about AWS being vulnerable to such an outdated attack? Are you worried about Bitcoin companies not doing enough to provide optimum security?

Today, the UK based company released the Raspberry Pi Zero, a brand new model priced at only $5. It includes a 1Ghz processor along with a Micro SD slot, USB outputs, HDMI output, and a few other components which are included in the other Raspberry Pi models. Surprisingly, the tiny board is 40% faster than the original Raspberry Pi 1. At such a low price, you can setup a bitcoin node for about $15, factoring in shipping and the micro SD card costs. The Raspberry Pi Zero comes preinstalled with full Raspbian, along with an installation of Minecraft. The Pi Zero shows just how cheap computers are becoming, which is leading us into the next revolution \u2013 IOT. IOT or Internet of Things is a phrase used to describe a network connected with physical objects such as microwaves, toasters, garage doors, house alarms, etc. Soon, computer chips will become so cheap to manufacture that your toaster will come preembedded with a wifi adapter and a processor. As a result, much more functionality can be added to simple physical things like a toaster and the network of physical things will evolve. Soon, it is going to be a norm for garage doors to communicate to a car\u2019s GPS via wifi and open when it detects the car nearby. If you are a Bitcoin user and would like to support the Bitcoin network then consider investing in setting up a bitcoin node. With the release of the Raspberry Pi Zero you have no excuse for inaction. Some incentives in running a full node include the ability to rebroadcast your own transactions, the ability to launch bitcoin services and products, and most importantly running a full node gives you somewhat of a voice when it comes to the block size debate. As we know, there have been many BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) which try to propose the next best algorithm for increasing the block size. As a node operator, you have the ability to choose which version of the bitcoin protocol your node will run. If you agree with a certain BIP more so than another you can run your node with the included BIP and other miners will see that. While its true that the real voters when it comes to the blocksize debate are miners, if the miners see significant support for a certain BIP then they might switch part of the pool\u2019s hashrate to the new version of bitcoin which shows more support. If you are a bitcoin developer or simply a bitcoin enthusiast that wants to support the network and not hurt your wallet then consider purchasing the new Raspberry Pi Zero and setting up a node.

Unfortunately, there is a small truth to that story, as there are various people looking to scam unknowing Bitcoin users. A new thread has surfaced on Reddit, explaining how various platform users have \u2013 allegedly \u2013 been scammed for thousands of dollars. Also read: Malware Attack Against Point-of-sale System Displays Need for Bitcoin Adoption It is important to keep in mind these are allegations made by another Reddit user, and everything should be taken with a grain of salt. Naming and shaming on the Reddit platform are nothing new, and not all of these claims are founded. However, there seem to be several pieces of evidence corroborating this story. Hiring someone on the Internet to complete a job or task is always risky business, as you never know whether or not the other person is legitimate. Building a reputation in the online world is a critical element to attract additional business opportunities, and Reddit user Irishfight had some positive testimonials to his name. As you might expect in this day and age, the person being hired will more often than not require a down payment to be made before starting the work. After all, anyone can claim they have the funds to hire someone, and never pay in the end. Taking this approach ensures both the \u201cemployer\u201d is legit, which establishes a certain level of trust. Unfortunately, there is a downside to this approach as well, as Bitcoin payments are non-refundable. Once the coins have been transferred to a different wallet, there is no way of getting them back, even if the deal goes sour. Irishfight decided to bank on that strategy, as work for the project never started. In addition, he made up excuses such as a broken down computer. In the end, all communication between both parties ceased. As it turns out, this was not the first time the name Irishfight appeared on scam allegations, as he is \u2013 allegedly \u2013 the owner of the MoneyPakforBitcoins.com website. Needless to say, this service will not exchange MoneyPak for Bitcoin by any means, and it looks to be a site luring unsuspecting people in. But there is more, as the website MoneyPakForBitcoins.com has been the subject of multiple scam allegations on Reddit and Google. Unfortunately, it\u2019s rather easy to get away with these things in the Bitcoin world, as the currency is not controlled \u2013 nor protected- by any authority in the world. Creating a reputation is a difficult hurdle to overcome, let alone to build any trust relationship in the world of Bitcoin and digital currency. This is where blockchain technology-based platforms will have to step up their game, as smart contracts provide an excellent opportunity to remove any trust factor from the equation. Additionally, smart contracts ensure employer funds are kept safe until the hired person completes the agreed upon job. Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is perfectly tailored to create these smart contracts, and it will only be a matter of time until smart contracts become the new norm in the way we do business all around the world.

Truth be told, Apple is a major name in the world of mobile devices, and the company is known to create and deliver quality products and services. But that does not necessarily Apple Pay will ever become a success, even though the service could launch in China as soon as February 2016. Also read: Digitizing PINs for Cards Resembles Bitcoin Payment Approach There seems to be an unwritten saying in the world of finance: \u201conce your company or service launches in China, it is destined for greatness\u201d. Some people feel this statement is true, whereas other, more realistic experts know that China is a double-edged blade. Apple is planning to launch its mobile payment solution in the country early next year, but whether or not this goes off without a hitch, remains to be seen. One thing to note is how Apple Pay will be facing stiff competition in China, as the mobile payment ecosystem is quite crowded in this country. Not only is there Alibaba\u2019s Alipay to take into account, but WeChat has been making a lot of headlines over the past 12 months as well. Especially this latter competitor could be of great concern to Apple as the WeChat has recently partnered with Western Union. But that is not all, as China\u2019s UnionPay service is keeping a tight control of bank cards. One could even go as far as saying UnionPay has a near-monopoly on bank-issued payment cards for the time being, and it will be a difficult task for Apple Pay to gain a foothold in this country. In fairness, China remains one of the most promising markets for Apple as a whole, as long as the local demand for iPhones remains as high as it is right now. This also creates an interesting incentive for Apple, as they will need to ensure all of their NFC-capable device need to be able to use Apple Pay as soon as possible. According to the information posted by WSJ, Apple managed to strike a deal with the four main state-run banks in China so far. If all things go according to plan \u2013 and they rarely do \u2013 Apple Pay will become available in China from February 8 forward. However, there is still the matter of regulatory concerns to take into consideration. While there is a strong demand for Apple devices in China, it remains to be seen whether or not Apple Pay will be of any relevance in the country anytime soon. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has become somewhat of a fan-favorite in China, even though the People\u2019s Bank of China has issued several warnings against usage of this digital currency. Additionally, all third-party payment providers are discouraged from venturing into the world of Bitcoin and digital currencies. However, that situation could change at any time as Bitcoin trading volume remains high across all Chinese exchanges. Only time will tell which payment method will prevail, but for once, Bitcoin and Apple might be facing a similar uphill battle. What are your thoughts in the potential launch of Apple Pay in China?

While cardholder information is stored on the chip embedded in these devices \u2013 or in the magnetic strip on the back \u2013 it\u2019s not all that difficult to copy the details. When using the card at an ATM or payment terminal, users will need to enter a PIN. But what if that PIN can be digitized soon? Also read: Malware Attack Against Point-of-sale System Displays Need for Bitcoin Adoption The final barrier of protecting customer financial data comes in the form of PIN authentication when making card transactions. Some experts view this \u201cforced PIN entry\u201d as a two-factor authentication method, protecting the consumer from funds being stolen. However, relying on just a PIN isn\u2019t sufficient and the technology has to keep evolving. MyPINpad has come up with a solution to digitize these PIN numbers and plans to offer the functionality to both online and mobile shoppers. To be more precise, this digitized form of PIN authentication would be made available to consumers using a mobile device and desktop computers. What makes the service offered by MyPINpad so interesting is how it will not disrupt the existing bank protocols when making a card payment. In most cases, any form of additional security would cause inconvenience for users, but that does not appear to be the case here. Furthermore, the digitized PIN authentication method can co-exist with a traditional manual entry of the code. VocaLink has inked a five-year agreement with MyPINpad to make this project a success. At the time of publication, there have been talks between both parties and major UK banks, merchants, and PSP\u2019s. As you would come to expect, this new service will need to be tested thoroughly before it becomes available for mass adoption. The best part of the solution by MyPINpad and VocaLink is how it will give consumers a sense of familiarity when digital authorizing their PIN. If there is one thing the everyday consumer does not like, it is when things change, even if that change provides additional security. Using digital PIN authentication is nothing new in the world of Bitcoin and digital currency. Bitcoin users have been able to authenticate with a digital PIN for multiple years now. This authentication is required not only when accessing a Bitcoin wallet, but also for making a transaction. In a way, digital PIN authentication is a convenient way to verify ownership of the payment method. By giving this authentication procedure a digital aspect, it will effectively serve as \u201cone-and-a-half-factor authentication\u201d, as users will need to own the card, and provide a way to digitally authenticate this PIN.

On reddit, some users have claimed that the 21 Bitcoin computer is overpriced and the same features can be replicated using a simple $35 Raspberry Pi. However, many features such as Bittransfers between 21 users would not work along with any new updates which will be deployed by 21. Here is a statement from the CEO: Since the 21 Bitcoin computer is simply a Raspberry Pi 2.0 with an ASIC chip, an interesting argument arises. If no special hardware is really needed in order to run the 21 software, should the company have sold the software package instead?

Most of these currencies are all dependent on how the US Dollar performs, as this is the world\u2019s global currency for the time being. However, if the current trends keep up, the US Dollar will be worth as much as the Euro. What effect will this have on Bitcoin, though? Also read: Kamcord Launches Mobile Game Streaming App \u2013 Bitcoin Support Imminent? Depending on who you might pose the question to, fiat currencies with the same value are quite confusing. The main reason there are different fiat currencies is because individual countries want to have some form of control over the amount of money in circulation. For instance, you can\u2019t pay with US Dollar in Europe, although you can in Hong Kong. Assuming the US Dollar would become worth as much as the Euro in the near future, the question becomes why one would be better than the other. There are quite a few EU residents who would like nothing more than to get rid of the Euro, and use a global currency instead. Furthermore, Mario Draghi \u2013 President of the European Central Bank \u2013 issued a statement indicating he will create more money for the economy in Europe. Do keep in mind that by saying he will \u201ccreate more money\u201d, he means there will be more bills and coins in circulation, why do not increase the overall value of the Euro. In fact, such a move would have the opposite effect as it would decrease the value of the current monetary supply. Europe\u2019s economy is in a lull right now, as the economy is subject to a nearly nonexistent inflation. There are a few options to counter this problem, such as deepening the negative interest rates even further, or extending the money-printing program. However, the Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates in the US, creating an interesting paradigm where both currencies are moving in opposite directions. Parity between two major fiat currencies is not something that happens all that often. However, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time the US Dollar and Euro reach a state of parity, as the same thing happened 13 years ago. But one thing\u2019s for sure: global currencies are the future, and neither USD or EUR falls into that category. Unlike these fiat currencies, Bitcoin is the only form of value that offers a universal appeal. One Bitcoin is the same in Kenya as it is in Texas or Singapore. The value of that Bitcoin is slightly different everywhere, yet it can be exchanged into nearly every local currency is existence today. However, there is one major drawback to Bitcoin as well, as it operates completely outside of the control of central authorities or banks. Additionally, Bitcoin is not accepted as globally as fiat currency, and it will take some time until this happens. That being said, central banks can only do so much until the ship sinks completely.

Anyone who has stayed in a hotel managed by Starwood Hotels and Resorts may want to keep an eye on their financial statements. As it turns out, more than 50 hotels have been affected by a malware attack targeting the point-of-sale systems, putting customers\u2019 financial information at risk. Also read: Coinbase Launches Bitcoin VISA Debit Card Attacking a point-of-sale system with malware is not something that occurs all that often, albeit it can cause a lot of havoc and damage. According to the information we have received, this malware has been infecting various point-of-sale systems throughout the United States and Canada. Consumers who have used a credit or debit card at a hotel restaurant or gift shop may be victim to hackers stealing financial data. The list of affected locations includes Westin and Sheraton hotels throughout the US and Canada, as well as other locations managed by Starwood Hotels and Resorts. All of the malware has been removed from the point-of-sale terminals and additional security measures have been implemented, according to a statement issued by the company. Though credit card information may have been exposed as a result of this malware attack, card PIN numbers were not affected. For most consumers, this means their cards can not be emptied at an ATM, but that doesn\u2019t make the malware attack less worrying. In the end, sensitive consumer details have leaked due to improper security precautions. What is even more concerning is how high-profile locations, such as the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel and the Westin Los Angeles Airport, have been affected by this malware attack. Prominent locations, especially when managed by an overarching group, should always provide top-notch security measures. As is usually these case with these types of reports, the malware attacks have been occurring for quite some time now. The report indicates how the earliest incidents was reported back in November of 2014, and the most recent theft took place in March of 2015. For the time being, no new incidents were announced since the end of Q1 2015. When accepting traditional payment methods, such as credit and debit cards, there are only so many layers of security that can be added over time. The biggest issue really concerns how these payment methods were never intended to be used on such a global scale. Also, this malware attack targeted the payment terminals being used, and not the cards themselves. For merchants and retailers, there are very few payment methods that offer additional security at their disposal. Bitcoin is a payment method that removes chargebacks and fraud from the equation, at lower transaction fees. Furthermore, Bitcoin is a global currency, which can be used and accepted by anyone in the world within minutes. What are your thoughts on this malware attack targeting point-of-sale terminals?

Earlier this week the market had a mini $14 bull run which brought bitcoin to the pre November bubble range of $330. In my last bitcoin technical analysis I discussed how the price drop on the 15th was nothing but a bull trap. Whether the current drop will prove to be yet another bull trap is up for debate. Volume died down after the 17th and as mentioned earlier, traders were waiting on the sidelines watching out for the next wave. The wave sure came today in the form of a quick faith test as the price dipped over $20 and touched $310. Part of the reason for the crash seems to be the emergency meeting that the EU is holding on friday regarding regulation of virtual currencies, gold, and precious metals, as a response to the recent terrorist attack. However, in light of recent news, bitcoin and encryption did not play a role in the paris attack because the Paris police found a cellphone with an unencrypted SMS saying \u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019re starting\u201d. bytevc from r/BitcoinMarkets summarized the current state of the market and remains bullish: On the other hand, users on tradingview share a bearish vibe and FxWirePro claims that the price is going to further decline as EU looks to regulate BItcoin further and advises to sell on rallies. A few hours ago, the Washington Times released an article claiming the EU is going to potentially ban bitcoin during the meeting on friday. However, the article simply quotes the original reuters article which is linked earlier in this post. Such articles may scare weak hands and more sells may follow if the media keeps sensationalizing ideas to ban bitcoin. Currently bitcoin is trading at $320 on a rebound rally from the earlier drop.

Also read: Blockchain A Valuable Ally for DOJ In Fight Against Deceptive Dietary Supplements Bringing mobile payment solutions to the general public is not an easy task, even for technology giants like LG. Although the mobile payment market is on the verge of becoming overcrowded, the company feels their LG Pay service has potential to be superior to other similar services available to customers right now. However, there are some caveats to this story, as LG partnered with two South Korean credit card issuers hardly anyone will have ever heard of. Granted, Shinhan Card and KB Kookmin Card are major names in South Korea, but they have no reach whatsoever outside of the country. On the other hand, this decision should not come as too big of a surprise, as LG is a South Korean company. It only makes sense that the consumer electronics giant wants to offer this new service in its home country first before expanding LG Pay to other countries around the world. Furthermore, there are not too many details regarding the rollout of LG Pay, though it seems fair to assume a release in the US or Europe will not happen anytime soon. In this regard, LG Pay is not all that different from similar solutions such as Samsung Pay and Apple Pay, both of which are available in very few countries right now. Last but not least, very few details have been revealed regarding the technical side of LG Pay. It remains to be seen whether or not this mobile payment service will use Bluetooth, NFC, or any other form of communication to complete payments. Additionally, whether or not the versions of the Android OS will be compatible with LG pay is also yet to be disclosed. More details are expected to be announced over the coming weeks. Many industry experts worry how the mobile payment ecosystem is becoming more and more fractured as time progresses. There are so many different options available and having a choice is always positive for the consumer. However, none of these solutions can offer a complete package just yet, as they all rely on traditional financial infrastructure. Unlike all of these mobile payment solutions \u2013 including LG Pay \u2013 Bitcoin is an option well worth considering for merchants. There is no additional infrastructure cost for the retailer, transaction fees are low, and payments are completed within mere seconds. More importantly, Bitcoin payments do not require third-party approval from financial institutions. It will be interesting to see who comes out on top of this battle for mobile payment supremacy. Any payment method relying on credit cards or bank accounts sounds convenient on paper, yet they are faced with limited availability.

Even though platforms such as Twitch and Youtube Gaming are attracting a lot of interest from people who enjoy PC or console gaming, the mobile market is left out more often than not. Kamcord, a new streaming service launching in Korea and Japan later today, allows gamers to stream their favorite iOS and Android Apps. The future of game streaming is shaping up nicely, that much is certain. Also read: LG Pay Wants To Compete With Bitcoin and Apple Pay More and more consumers are gaming on their mobile devices, and it was only a matter of time until this type of gameplay could be live streamed as well. Major streaming platforms like Twitch and Youtube Gaming are not focusing that much on mobile gamers just yet, but the launch of Kamcord might make them change their mind. Promoting a new service like Kamcord will be an interesting challenge although the company is well prepared for taking on this task. By bringing in some Korean and Japanese mobile gaming Youtube stars \u2013 yes, they do exist \u2013 the launch of Kamcord will be interesting to keep an eye on. Some people may have heard the name Kamcord before, as the company was founded in 2012 and originally started out as an SDK for mobile game developers to add gameplay recording to iOS games. Part of the success of mobile game playthrough streaming can be attributed to this SDK, and support for Android followed in 2013. Thanks to a helping hand from various investors, Kamcord has put itself in prime position to conquer the mobile gaming streaming market in Japan, China, the US, and Korea. An aggressive international expansion is planned for the near future, as the company feels there is a dire need for such a move in the mobile live streaming space. That being said, Twitch offers mobile game streaming as well, and the brand name carries a lot more clout compared to Kamcord. But there are other competitors as well, including Mirrativ \u2013 for Android \u2013 and Mobcrush. But more competition can only be beneficial to the mobile game streaming industry, and it will be interesting to see how this market will evolve over the next few years. It is possible for mobile gamers to make live-streaming their full-time job if they are willing to pursue that opportunity. However, people are always limited to the number of payment methods they can use, all of which have certain risks of fraud and chargebacks associated with them. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a perfectly scalable mobile payment application that eliminates these risks and is subject to far lower transaction fees. It could be a wise move for Kamcord \u2013 or any of the other players active in this space \u2013 to take a closer look at integrating Bitcoin payments for donations and subscriptions. After all, the digital currency is quite popular in the same markets being targeted by Kamcord, and it could serve as an interesting experiment to say the least. What are your thoughts on Kamcord?

The reason for its success is quite simple, retailers enable discounts on their products and services, incentivizing consumers to spend money left, right, and center. However, is Black Friday all it claims to be, or are consumers starting to spend less? There are always two sides to a story, and the success of Black Friday is no different in that regard. In fact, the \u201csuccess\u201d of this semi-holiday is not as grand as most people envision it. For the consumer, huge discounts are always a blessing, and it incentivizes people to buy things they may or may not need, simply because of the lower price. However, these discounts have to be paid by someone, and commonly retailers are taking a small loss on each item sold. Some of the items offered at discounted prices allow vendors to break even, or at least still make a tiny profit, but in most cases the costs far outweigh the benefits. Success during Black Friday largely depends on which items are being put up for sale. While most consumers are looking for bargains in the luxury and electronics sections, back to school items are popular all year round. That being said, even those items are no guarantee of success in the long run. One thing most analysts and experts seem to overlook is how the world is still in a recession to this very day. Economies have been growing slowly \u2013 assuming they did so to begin with \u2013 and purchasing power is only decreasing over time. Consumers are becoming self-conscious about their spending behavior, and although Black Friday is appealing, more and more people will decide to buy less, or nothing at all. Additionally, there is always a large part of the consumer base who deliberately misses out on Black Friday sales to begin with. Buying items they don\u2019t need at discounted prices is not doing anyone any favors. Such an outlook is gloomy for the retailers, but a solution might be just around the corner. Keeping a business afloat in this day and age of high transaction costs is all but impossible unless you are part of a large brand. For small and medium-sized businesses, there are only so many aspects where overhead costs can be cut. Adopting alternative payment systems that do not require additional infrastructure to set up, are an option well worth exploring. Bitcoin presents an interesting case in this regard, as retailers can save money on transaction costs alone. Additionally, merchants can receive the fiat currency value of Bitcoin transactions within 1-2 business days, rather than waiting 30 days for a settlements to clear. Even though Bitcoin is not adopted by mainstream consumers just yet, its power and value should not be underestimated. What are your thoughts on this year\u2019s Black Friday? Will you be buying more, less, or the same as previous years? Let us know in the comments below!

F-Secure product manager Janne Pirttilahti strongly feels that consumers should be more concerned about using public WiFi-hotspot connectivity, and even suggest the usage of 2FA and a VPN to encrypt traffic. Especially for Bitcoin users, public WiFi-hotspots pose a serious risk. Also read: London Stock Exchange and CME Interested in Blockchain Technology It doesn\u2019t take much for an assailant to \u201creplace\u201d a regular public WiFi hotspot with a rogue network. For the end user, everything would seem normal, but on the back end, things are vastly different. In the worst case scenario, assailants will not only monitor all traffic but use it to infect devices with malware and keyloggers. The topic of WiFi hotspot security has been kicked around for many years now, and there is still no proper solution to this problem. Or to be more precise, there are solutions available, but these requires participation by the end user. Using a VPN, or even two-factor authentication for all platforms accessed online, is not very convenient for most consumers, although additional layers of security are never a bad thing. To demonstrate how easy it is to set up a rogue access point: all an assailant would need is a laptop and a WiFi-dongle. There are no requirements regarding whether or not more expensive materials work better, as even the cheapest of devices can be used to pull off this trick. By using these two tools, an assailant can then broadcast a signal to the existing WiFi hotspot, and order it to disconnect all users. A little-known fact about access points is how their signal strength is not the greatest, and it is quite easy to broadcast a stronger signal to overpower an existing network. As a result, previously connected devices will attempt to connect to a network with the highest signal strength. Once this occurs, all hell can break loose, and the assailant can snoop on internet traffic and intercept various types of data, ranging from images to passwords. VPN connections can solve this problem although they are not very user-friendly. Many industry experts feel that enabling VPN connectivity should be as easy as pressing a button. Also, most consumers do not trust third-party VPN providers, as these companies lack transparency. The ongoing issues with public WiFi hotspot connectivity pose a serious threat to Bitcoin users as well. Even though it is not possible to steal a wallet data file without much more effort than just creating a rogue WiFi access point, this attack could be used to install malware. Once a device is infected with malware, anything could happen to it. Bitcoin users should lead by example, by ensuring their Internet traffic is encrypted at all times when accessing public WiFi hotspots. Whether that is through a VPN, 2FA, or other tools, is of less importance. Any financial service used while connecting to a public WiFi hotspot is subject to attack by someone, and taking the necessary precautions should be the new norm.

This is one of the many reasons why looking up Google search trends can be quite fun and insightful. As far as the monetary aspect of our society goes, fiat currencies such as Dollar, Yen, Pound, and Yuan, are some of the more common searches on Google and other engines. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has never been overly popular. Until now, that is, as it turns out people are Googling \u201cBitcoin\u201d more often than \u201cYuan\u201d.

However, phoning Dell support to address this issue is not an ideal option, as their representatives apparently still have no clue what Bitcoin is.

The user report mentions how, once the payment page has loaded and the \u201cPay with Bitcoin\u201d button has been clicked, there is no redirection to the Coinbase website.

The $336 zone is an important pivot point, it served as resistance a few times this past week accompanied by major trading volume. With positive news such as the Bitcoin symbol being added to the Unicode Standard and the acceptance of blockchain technology by banks and institutional exchanges, Bitcoin is holding strong at the current level. However, some major sell pressure is coming it\u2019s way. Since black friday is coming up next week, many customers will use bitcoin to buy goods and electronics. As a result, when the merchants start cashing out their bitcoins and converting to USD, sell pressure will build on major exchanges causing the price to drop. We can only speculate as to when or if the price drop will happen, but traders should be aware of the upcoming event and plan their trading strategy accordingly. On another note, according to koinster from r/BitcoinMarkets it is currently a good time to buy, as bitcoin finally broke through the $300 resistance zone around March and July.

Since MMM Global is a classic ponzi scheme we need to understand how these schemes work. They start with a hook promising high returns with little to no risk, much like a pyramid scheme. However, unlike pyramid schemes one does not need to recruit others in order to earn a commission. Funds from new participants are used to pay existing participants higher up on the ladder. The final stage of a pyramid scheme is it\u2019s collapse, surprisingly the collapse of ponzi schemes is slow and painful as existing investors often reinvest back into the dying system, thus prolonging the inevitable. In order to figure out what stage MMM Global is, we need to look at some data. Looking up mmmglobal.org on alexa gives us a pretty clear picture that the site traffic is increasing. Using further research I found that MMMGlobal.org used to receive around three thousand unique viewers a day three weeks ago. Today, MMMGlobal receives more than seven thousand unique users. In other words, they more than doubled their traffic in the past 3 weeks. Further research on youtube reveals more than 50 new videos uploaded in the past 24 hours all urging new users to join MMM Global and showing off payments received. It is obvious that MMM Global is still in it\u2019s growth stage, the question is, when is it going to crumble? It took authorities three years to take down the original MMM scheme in 1989. If we assume that the police have more resources and are better educated about ponzi schemes, and taking into account the whole Paycoin/ Paybase / GAW Miners fiasco with Josh Garza who still a year later is a free man, I give MMM at least a year before it crashes. Another important detail to notice is even though MMM Global was supposedly established in 2011, MMM China was just recently launched in April of this year. Since the Chinese are known to lead bitcoin markets, lets take a look at recent bitcoin volume starting April 2015 (charts taken from bitcoinwisdom): Here we can see a clear increase in trading volume around mid June. It may be a coincidence that MMM China launched 3 months earlier and now bitcoin trade volume is surging, but if the increased trading volume continues and MMM China grows, then we could speculate on a relationship. If bitcoin price is really in a linear relationship with MMM China\u2019s growth then what will happen to the price once MMM China goes bust? Since a Ponzi scheme\u2019s death is slow, we might see a powerful yet long bear market as investors try to liquidate their bitcoins. On the other hand, bitcoin might have outgrown ponzi schemes like MMM Global and MMM China and what we are seeing is merely a coincidence, one that Mavrodi is using to his advantage. Tell us whether you think that bitcoin\u2019s price is related to Mavrodi\u2019s ponzi scheme, or whether its all a big coincidence.

It is a next generation exchange aimed at institutional clientele. As a result, the exchange lacks liquidity in the market allowing for a buyer with enough fiat and a fat finger to completely buy out the order book and send the price skyrocketing. Earlier today, as pointed out first by the user vevue from r/Bitcoin bitcoin price on the Gemini exchange skyrocketed to $2200. The direct cause for the spike is yet unconfirmed but it is strongly suggested that the cause is due to human error. Simply misplacing a period or forgetting a zero when creating a bid or an ask can shift a value a whole magnitude causing unforeseeable losses. This isn\u2019t the first time that such an event transpired, in fact last year a trading bot on btc-e malfunctioned and started executing trades against itself causing the price to momentarily plummet. A similar event happened on poloniex last month where someone forgot an extra zero and as pointed out by americanpegasus from bitcointalk \u201cInstead of putting in a buy order of everything below .0000012 bitcoins they must have attempted to buy everything below .000012 bitcoins, an entire order of magnitude difference.\u201d This caused yet another momentary spike in price on said exchange. The so called fat finger trades that cause massive losses to unfortunate victims are more common than you think. They are so common that Coinbase implemented a fat finger protection mechanism: If the price spike is in fact due to human error then Gemini exchange should implement a fat finger protection mechanism similar to coinbase\u2019s. It is surprising to see an exchange with as much funding as Gemini forget to implement such an important feature. Currently the exchange is undergoing planned maintenance according to their official twitter account: It is interesting to see if Gemini will honor the executed trades or if it will roll back the orderbook, we reached out to Gemini exchange for a comment. According to market data under one hundred bitcoins were exchanged during the spike to $2200. Because Gemini was able to respond so fast it seems that minimal damage was done and the exchange should resume operations shortly.

One of the main topics of debate remains the distribution of royalties per played track, and more and more artists are considering to keep their new albums off Spotify completely. The latest artist to join this growing list is none other than Adele, who might be looking at other options to earn a fair share of revenue. Also read: ZapChain Raises $350,000 in Seed Funding For once, the debacle regarding whether or not Adele\u2019s new album will appear on Spotify or not has nothing to do with royalties. Or to be more precise: Adele\u2019s management demands that Spotify limits the availability of her album to paid subscribers only, which would make it accessible to less than one in three users on the platform. At the time of publication, Spotify has rejected this idea, which could lead to the new Adele album never making it to the streaming service. Furthermore, the company stated how this entire story is \u201cuntrue\u201d, although there is reasonable doubt regarding the validity of that statement. There are two possible ways forward for Spotify in this scenario. Either the company changes the rules, and rakes in tons of revenue from featuring Adele\u2019s new album on their service, even if it is to paid subscribers only. At the same time, that decision could end up alienating over 70% of Spotify users around the world, which would be hurting business far more. Unfortunately for Spotify, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time this company misses out on featuring the biggest album of the year. Nor will it be the last time either, as Coldplay seemingly has no plans to put their new album on Spotify either. This could throw a major monkey wrench into the spokes of this overly popular music streaming service. Music artists have another option at their disposal to bring in additional revenue from their albums. By accepting Bitcoin payments in exchange for single tracks or full albums, artists can attract a whole new customer base around the world. Additionally, artists would be protected against any Bitcoin price volatility by exchanging the funds to fiat currency on the fly. Famous hip-hop artist Talib Kweli recently announced how his new album is being sold for Bitcoin through the ZapChain platform. Artists will have to rethink their monetization strategies, and Bitcoin will play an important role in the future of the music industry.

During the rally, Bitcoin received much mainstream attention with articles coming from CNN, Bloomberg, and New York Times. As a result, many new users found out about Bitcoin and purchased some to join the rally. However, with the recent collapse in prices many are left with a feeling of disappointment and failure towards their decision of purchasing Bitcoin. On the bright side, black friday is coming up and if you have some left over Bitcoins you can spend them and save on gifts by visiting either bitcoinblackfriday.com or bitcoinblackfriday.info. Even though bitcoin is hovering around $300, it is still up from a month ago before this correctional bubble. While we remained hopeful that the market would stabilize above the $350 support, over 10,000 BTC was dumped on the major exchanges which brought the price as low as $290. Since then we tested support at $300 three times, suggesting that the market is trying to stabilize above the $300 support. The current resistance point is $320, we tested it twice on the rebound from $290. Unless bitcoin breaks through $320, the short term trend is bearish, break below support targets are $270-$260. FxWirePro from tradingview suggests that \u201cIt is good to sell on rallies around $330 with SL around $370 for the TP of $270/$256\u201d For the optimists, Mutt7 from r/bitcoinmarkets suggests an interesting strategy to sell in the $x00 levels such as $305 or $405 and buy in when the price crashes even further. The $x00 levels have a psychological effect that serve as almost a barrier to exit on a rally. Those who followed his advice and sold right around $502 on November 4th could have caught the very top.

The latest discovery makes every Android device vulnerable to hijacking, assuming they are running the Google Chrome browser. In most cases, consumers will have this browser installed, simply because it is better compared to the standard browser. Phone hijacking a serious threat, especially for Bitcoin users. Also read: Microsoft Dives In On The Blockchain The exploit in question, which has been demonstrated at MobilePwn2Own at the PacSec conference, focuses its attention on the JavaScript V8 engine. What is of particular worry, is how any mobile device running Google Chrome is vulnerable, including devices with an older version of the Android operating system. Unlike most exploits targeting mobile devices, this Google Chrome exploit does not require multiple chained vulnerabilities to work its magic. In fact, this is one of the very few single clean exploits security researchers have seen in years. For Android users, this is not good news at all, as their devices could get hijacked without them even noticing it, simply because there is very little effort involved by hackers to pull it off. All it takes is the user accessing a website running the JavaScript V8 vulnerability running the Google Chrome browser, which will install an arbitrary application without requiring user interaction. Once this application has been installed, an attacker will gain complete control of the mobile device. Patching such a vulnerability is not an easy task, and Google will \u2013 most likely \u2013 pay a security bug bounty for the vulnerability, as there was no disclosure of exploit details during the conference. Once details of such an exploit are made public, it is only a matter of time until all hell breaks loose. However, fixing the problem is not possible until Google gets their hands on more details. Having a mobile device hijacked means that an attacker can do just about anything with any of the applications running on the machine. In the case of Bitcoin users, this also means an attacker could empty a client\u2019s wallet, assuming they would get a hold of the pin code associated with the software. However, installing keyloggers without the user noticing it would be one of the possibilities to tackle that issue. People can only hope Google addresses this issue sooner rather than later before anything major happens because of it. Bitcoin users on Android are advised not to visit any odd-looking websites on their mobile devices using the Google Chrome browser. Even though they should never engage in this type of behavior, now is certainly not the time to start doing so. What are your thoughts on this vulnerability? Will it have an effect on Bitcoin users?

Even though social networks such as Twitter and Facebook were conceived to achieve that goal, it hasn\u2019t worked out according to plan just yet. Pypestream, a fairly new startup, may have cracked the code to this problem. But can this platform be used to foster widespread Bitcoin adoption? Also read US Attorney\u2019s Office Files New Charges Against Coin.mx Operator Customer support experiences are, in most cases, very rarely positive. Pypestream wants to address this issue, as their messaging gap bridges the gap between businesses and consumers. Retailers can create different types of accounts on the Pypestream network, rather than using one account for every announcement, return, or customer support. For the consumer, a messaging app can prove to be quite beneficial as well. Rather than spending hours on the phone while listening to hold music, they can simply send a message through Pypestream. Once a company representative gets in touch with the consumer, they will receive a notification. In fact, it is much more convenient to leave the app running in the background, as it is a massive cost-cutting measure. Do keep in mind that business will be able to generate a stream of messages on Pypestream through both automation and human interaction. Regardless of whether consumers are being contacted by actual human beings, the interaction itself will feel more natural, and provide a less stressful experience than ever before. It will take some time until major businesses get on board with Pypestream, as most companies have their own in-house developed social messaging solutions. However, it remains to be seen which solution gains the upper hand in a few months from now, as consumers are getting sick and tired of horrible customer support. What makes Pypestream even more appealing is the effect it could have on Bitcoin adoption, both by retailers and consumers alike. With such a direct line of communication between all parties, this social messaging app can prove to be invaluable for Bitcoin awareness all over the world.

Over the past year or so, various reports have surfaced regarding /r:/Bitcoin being mismanaged, and comments are being downvoted \u2013 or even removed \u2013 at every turn. Things have really gotten out of hand once the discussion about Bitcoin block sizes started. Those discussions are now spilling over, and Coinbase could be effectively banned from all major Bitcoin platforms soon. Discussion about the Bitcoin block size proposal is not welcome on /r/Bitcoin, nor should these discussions take place on Bitcointalk or even Bitcoin.org. Or that is what Bitcointalk and /r/Bitcoin owner Theymos wants people to believe, as the strongly feels BIP 101 is an abomination, and should be labeled as an altcoin. For those of you who are blissfully unaware, Theymos controls /r/Bitcoin, Bitcointalk, the Bitcoin wiki, Bitcoin.org and Bitcoin.it. All of these platforms are the most popular ones for Bitcoin and digital currency discussions, yet they are in the full control of one individual. Whether or not that is the true abomination, is up to our readers. Either way, Coinbase has openly expressed their support of the BIP 101 proposal, and they might be punished for doing so. BIP 101 Is known as Bitcoin XT, which is an effective fork of the Bitcoin protocol as most people know it. However, it is up to the community to decide if they want to stock to Bitcoin Core or switch over to Bitcoin XT. While that decision should be sooner rather than later, there are still plenty of discussions going on regarding this debacle. As Coinbase, together with a fair amount of companies and mining pools, are supporting BIP 101, they are supporting the \u201calternative\u201d version of Bitcoin. On the surface, both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin XT are exactly the same thing, albeit they support bigger network blocks in a different manner. According to information posted on /r/Bitcoin, Coinbase may be planning to switches all of their full Bitcoin nodes to BIP 101. Doing so would violate the /r/Bitcoin rules as Bitcoin XT is deemed an \u201caltcoin\u201d, which has no place in this public forum. Furthermore, Coinbase would be restricted to posting in the altcoin section of Bitcointalk, Bitcoin.org and Bitcoin.it. While there is a fair point raised in terms of \u201cchoosing sides\u201d, no single individual should have the audacity to act in such an unprofessional manner. Granted, Theymos has one of the worst reputations in terms of \u201cpeople management\u201d, yet there are still plenty of people supporting his decisions. Eventually, people like him could be the downfall of Bitcoin as a community, rather than the block size debate.

But once that funding has been received, time is ticking down until investors want to see a working prototype of some sorts. Failing to deliver on that promise will see companies go bust, and Bitcoin startups may very well suffer the same fate. Whenever a company secures a round of funding, there is general excitement from both employees and investors alike. Money is a key element when it comes to developing the next big thing that will revolutionize the world as we know it. However, there is a certain level of time pressure to take into account, which is also the determining factor to make or break a company. Funding does not necessarily have to come from high-profile people active in the business world either, mind you. In this day and age, it has become much simpler to find funding through crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo. In exchange for their pledge, backers will \u2013 usually \u2013 receive a physical reward. Unfortunately, those rewards are not always delivered, or at last, not as promised. Take a look at Robotic Dragonfly, for example, a project that raised over US$1m through IndieGogo in 2012. Fast forward to today, and the company behind this project \u2013 called Techjet \u2013 finds itself in major financial trouble albeit it is technically speaking not their fault. Not all of the pledged funds has been released by Paypal and Indiegogo, although it remains a mystery as to how much funds are still in the wrong hands at this time. However, the fact remains none of the Robotic Dragonflies have shipped so far, and Techjet is not the first \u2013 nor the last \u2013 company to become a victim of their own success. Crowdfunding always carries a certain risk, and it is unfortunate to see so many Indiegogo backers falling victim to a company\u2019s bad management. That being said, crowdfunding is never guaranteed success, and despite the best efforts of crowdfunding platforms, these scenarios will happen every so often. These same principles apply to Bitcoin companies all over the world, most of which have secured some form of funding. Even though funding is not a guaranteed formula for success, although it certainly helps to get the ball rolling. However, investors are not the most patient crowd by any means, and Bitcoin startups need to keep their responsibilities in mind. Over the past 24 months, there has been a massive influx of VC funds into the world of Bitcoin. That being said, hardly any of these companies are even close to a finished product right now. While there is still time for these companies to get their act together, things need to start happening sooner rather than later.

But all of that is coming to change, as a newly released type of ransomware is focusing all of its attention on Linux users all over the world. Also read: FIAP Technical University in S\u00e3o Paulo Experiments with Bitcoin Up until this point, the most obvious operating system to attack with ransomware was Windows. Keeping in mind how this is the most commonly used operating system in the world, infecting many people is not as difficult as it sounds where Windows is concerned. Different operating systems, on the other hand, are very rarely affected by the same type of virii and other nasty stuff that plagues their Microsoft counterparts. This is longer the case, though, as a new form of encryption malware has been detected on the Linux operating system recently. Labelled as \u201cLinux Encoder 1\u201d, this malware is \u2013 for the most part \u2013 targeting web servers by encrypting all of the content located on these machines, and attempting to force the user to pay a ransomware price of 1 Bitcoin. Injecting this ransomware on Linux web servers can be done by exploiting a vulnerability in the Magento CMS. Even though a patch was released on October 31 this year, not all of the web servers have been upgraded by the end user. Especially e-commerce platforms are at risk due to this vulnerability, making them a prone target for a ransomware attack. That being said, there are concerns regarding other content management systems being vulnerable to some form of exploit as well. But there is a silver lining as well, as the exploit can only be executed if an attacker gains administrator privileges on the web server. As you would come to expect from ransomware, there are a few certain file types and systems that are being targeted specifically. Nginx, Apache, and MySQL are of particular interest to this ransomware, as these are high-profile file systems where users store a lot of sensitive data. However, file types are not safe from harm either, as this ransomware goes after Windows executables, and file extensions such as .asp, .jar, and any form of a document. At the time of publication, there have been no reports regarding Bitcoin users being affected by this malware on Linux. However, one can rest assured this malware has the potential to encrypt wallet.dat files as well. All readers using the Magento CMS system are advised to upgrade their installation asap, to prevent any harm.

The market has neither tested the $350-$360 support zone, nor the $400 resistance zone; our conclusion is that traders are waiting on the sidelines for any major activity. Data such as the decrease in volume and RSI along with a decrease of margin plays on bitfinex reinforces our speculation. One observation originally mentioned by nagatora to notice is if we plot a fibonacci retracement using the $198 low on September 24th, and the recent $502 high we see that $385 is an important pivot point. If the market breaks through $385 then our next stop is $430, otherwise get ready to test support at $350. These next few days are important in terms of setting the current trend.

Even if that were the case, paying up the money being demand is not always a viable option. ProtonMail was recently faced with the dilemma of paying up 15 Bitcoins or being taken down by a DDoS attack. Despite making the payment, their services were taken out through a DDoS attack anyway. Also read: Bitcoin Technical Analysis 11/6/15 \u2013 Volatility Strikes Before you continue reading this story, it is imperative to keep in mind Bitcoin is not the culprit in this story. Granted, the attack(s) asked for a Bitcoin payments, but this digital currency is anything but anonymous. In fact, sending a wire transfer of a Western Union payment is far more anonymous compared to Bitcoin. That being said, ProtonMail is one of the very few companies willing to pay a ransom when faced with an imminent threat. In this case, their plan backfired, as the service was taken down regardless. The DDoS attack subsided after a brief period, though, and ProtonMail services were restored shortly after.

Especially in the US, services like IRS have a worse-than-bad reputation among the general public, even though these people are only doing their jobs. But if it\u2019s up to several Republican presidential candidates, the IRS won\u2019t be around for much longer. Imagine the effect this would have on Bitcoin as well. On paper, it is all but impossible to imagine the world where there is no IRS or taxation in place. However, there is a lot of confusion as to what the IRS does, as their main job is to ensure people properly file their taxes. Simplifying the concept of taxes could effectively put the IRS out of business completely. Tax reform proposals are nothing new under the sun, as various countries are working to achieve that goal. In theory, this is much easier said than done, as the current tax system has been in place for several decades. Any attempt to change this system could have catastrophic effects, although a reform is really needed. That being said, imagine a world where filling out taxes is as simple as using an application on a mobile device. Or for the people preferring to fill in paper forms, there would be a postcard-sized one-pager. Unfortunately, this would not remove the need to verify every tax submission, thus making it pretty much impossible to eliminate the IRS. Whether or not this \u201cnew breed of tax agency\u201d would still be called IRS, is something that can be debated upon later. There will always be a need for some form of \u201coverarching body\u201d to collect the taxpayers\u2019 money, as revenue agency have to keep tabs on who is paying what amounts and when. To give an example of how a tax reform could look like: one candidate is proposing to replace the income tax with a national sales tax. If this idea were to come to fruition, citizens will no longer pay taxes on income, investments or savings, but only on the purchase of goods and services. In the end, there would be more money for consumers, but whether or not this is a viable business model, remains to be seen. Regardless of how the tax system is to be reformed, it will always be a bit of a mess, which requires a ton of work to be sorted out. While there is a case to be made for making the tax filings a lot easier, it will not result in making the IRS completely obsolete overnight. But it gives something to think about, that\u2019s for sure. Depending on where you may live, Bitcoin may or may not be taxable in your country. Assuming it is, the ruling creates a bit of a bottleneck as far as filing taxes is concerned. Simplifying the entire taxation process could prove to be beneficial to Bitcoin users all over the world as well.

Many reasons have been attributed to the current rise, but the fact that china has unofficially recognized the validity and use of Bitcoin has been the one main reason behind the current price increase. As bitcoin has risen to over 100% in just a mater of weeks, many believe that this may be a price range destined for the short term, but with current price graphs and investors telling a different story lets look at the current state of Bitcoin markets. The past day has been slightly bearish in terms of market sentiment as the market corrects itself after the significantly high bubble, which was reached yesterday which was prices of Bitcoin edge close to the $500 mark. While prices of $480 were seen these were not meant to stay; over the past 24 hours we have seen a considerable drop in bitcoin prices by over $80. A decrease of over 15% is a considerable drop, but these prices have been held for a considerable number of hours. This has been clearly seen in many of the 6 hours graphs as the market hovers around the $390 \u2013 $406 mark remaining fairly stable. Speculation \u2013 While Bitcoin prices appear stable at the moment, it seems that the current volume being traded may not be enough to stabilize the price of the coin under the current market cap. Cryptocurrency investors had initiated dismissal on the current price rise, though reasonably others believe that the combination of capital controls in China and the fact many can directly convert their fiat from any bank account to Bitcoin are indications of a steady climb. The company, BTCC has also been one of the pivotal factors to contributing to the current price increase. As of now, I would say purchase with caution and restraint as the bitcoin volatility expressed by markets seems extremely unpredictable. However, come tomorrow and prices hold tight then it may be a surer sign that stability is here to stay.

Despite facing a ton of criticism from government officials and the general public, it is impossible to envision a world where car-sharing services like Uber are not part of everyday life. In a recent surprising turn of events, the company started accepting cash payments in Indonesia, yet people have been asking for Bitcoin integration for quite some time now. Also read: Bitcoin Startups Can Benefit From SEC Online Crowdfunding Ruling Indonesia is one of the underbanked regions of the world, so it only makes sense for innovative companies to appeal to as many residents as possible. Doing so would also mean companies have to adapt their business model regarding payment options, and cash payments are one of the most commonly used methods in the country. That being said, Uber is all about making the car-sharing experience as frictionless as possible, so cash payments don\u2019t seem to fit that bill at all. However, it important to note cash payments are limited to the city of Bandung, just outside of Jakarta. This testing ground of up to 2 million potential customers will give Uber valuable insights as to whether or not cash payments are a viable option. \u2013 Uber\u2019s Mike Brown told the media. Even a company like Uber needs to play catch-up to its competitors now and then, as both GrabTaxi and Grabcar have been accepting cash payments for quite some time. Additionally, Go-Jek \u2013 which offers a similar service like Uber but for motorbikes \u2013 is also taking cash payments. It may seem strange to hear Uber is still operating in Indonesia, especially since Bandung Mayor Ridwan Kamil declared the company to be illegal not too long ago. Truth be told, there is no real action being taken by authorities to enforce this ruling, allowing Uber to thrive in the \u201cgrey area of the law\u201d for the time being. Because Indonesia is a country where very few people have access to a bank account or credit card, it is also prone to digital currency adoption. Most people in this region are jumping straight to mobile payments, leapfrogging traditional financial infrastructure wherever possible. Bitcoin seems to be the next logical step for Indonesia, as walking around with plenty of cash is not safe either. Furthermore, Bitcoin can be bought over the counter at over 10,000 \u201cIndomaret\u201d convenience stores in the entire country. In theory, over 200 million unbanked people now have access to a financial instrument that not only works within the borders of the country but an on a global scale as well. Uber should start exploring the Bitcoin option before their rivals do, or they might lose ground all over the world.

If we take a look at the current RSI ( Relative Strength Index ) of the market we can see that it is almost the same as it was during the first bitcoin bubble where btc pushed $1000.

There is no obvious reason why the market is moving sideways, however there are a few theories that try to explain the current market. The first theory is that the MMM Global Republic of Bitcoin is the reason why the price is rising. The ponzi scheme uses Bitcoin in order to facilitate the transfer of funds between one participant to the other. It was led by Sergei Mavrodi, who already started another ponzi scheme also named MMM back in 1989 which was established with the help of his brother Vyacheslav Mavrodi, and Olga Melnikova. The name MMM came from the combining the first letters of the original founders\u2019 last names. Since MMM requires users to purchase bitcoins , some speculate that is the reason for the price increase. The ponzi scheme is truly massive as there are hundreds of videos being uploaded to youtube a day claiming they have received their payment, as the amount of participants increases so does the amount of buy pressure on the markets. Another theory as to why the bitcoin price is rising is due to Capital Controls in China. It all started with the 2015 stock market crash which happened in June. The government\u2019s response to slow down the crash resulted in regulators limiting the amount of shares investors could sell. It also stopped allowing Initial Public Offerings or IPOs, as a result many Chinese investors turned to bitcoins. No government can regulate the amount of bitcoins a user can sell, because it is a decentralized currency.

Some major resistance was broken during this bull run, specifically around $356 and the $400 mark. As long as the $400 support holds, which looks like it is; then we should be heading to one and two year all time highs.

This guide will show you how to get bitcoins in under an hour. First, sign up at LocalBitcoins which is a website similar to craigslist that allows users to post buy and sell offers for bitcoins. Unlike Craigslist, Localbitcoins also acts as an escrow for transactions, hence reducing the risk of fraud. Next, navigate to this link which will show all the sellers who are currently accepting cash deposits as a form of payment. If you look at the price / btc you will see that the listings charge only about 3%-4% markup on the price of btc. That is one of the lowest rates you can get on localbitcoins, as other online payments like paypal to bitcoin have atleast a 10% markup. The reason cash deposits are so cheap is because the buyer can almost never reverse them, that reduces the risk of fraud to the seller thus they are able to offer such low prices; meaning that you can get bitcoins cheaply and almost instantly once you make the deposit. Next, choose a seller who has high feedback and who was recently active. You can check a user\u2019s last activity by hovering over the circle next to their name. Navigate to their profile and verify that the seller has good feedback, has been recently active, and has little to no Blocks (people who blocked the seller). Next, go to the ad page and put in the amount of bitcoins you would like to buy, keep in mind sellers usually have trade limits which are specified on the listing. Once you choose the amount click the send trade request and wait for the seller to respond. For most cash deposits you will have to take a clear picture of the receipt which should have the bank logo, last 4 of account number, deposit amount and date. Once you send the picture of the receipt to the seller and he confirms it, he will release the escrow which will add coins to your localbitcoins.com wallet. NOTE: When doing cash deposits make sure to go through the escrow system that localbitcoins.com offers. By circumventing escrow you will have a much greater chance of getting scammed and loosing money.

One of the main reasons for this struggle is due to impending regulation on crowdfunding, and how it would affect small investors. A recent SEC ruling allows investors to buy stock in startup companies through online crowdfunding, which is great news for Bitcoin as well. Up until this announcement was made, only \u201caccredited investors\u201d were allowed to partake in online crowdfunding. An \u201caccredited investor\u201d is someone who owns over US$1m in assets \u2013 without taking the value of their primary residence into account \u2013 or an individual who received a yearly income of US$200,000 or more in the past two years. It goes without saying these restrictions exclude over 90% of the population of this world. All of that has come to change, as the Securities and Exchange Commission now gives small investors the opportunity to buy stock in startups through online crowdfunding. However, there will be certain limits imposed, to protect the \u201caverage person\u201d from making too many risky investments in a brief timespan. Any individual with an annual net income under US$100,000 can invest a maximum of US$2,000 per year through online crowdfunding. Individuals with larger incomes can invest up to 10% of their income per annum. A golden rule in the crowdfunding business is to \u201cnever invest more money than you can afford to lose\u201d, so these limits seem to make sense. Smaller investors are not the only party facing certain limits, although the thresholds are far less strict for startup companies. According to the ruling, companies may collect up to US$1m through online crowdfunding per year, without having to register with the SEC itself. However, companies will need to provide investor details, their business plans, and a comprehensive list of the company\u2019s employee structure. All things considered, the SEC ruling seems to be providing a step in the right direction, for both startups and smaller investors. That being said, online crowdfunding si no formula for guaranteed success by any means, and these \u201cstrict\u201d limits are put in place to protect the consumer. Over the past year and a half, Bitcoin has been facing a lot of scrutiny from government officials and regulators. The disruptive digital currency operates outside of the control of banks and authorities, making it prone to harsh regulatory decisions. BitLicense, the first ever Bitcoin regulatory framework for the state of New York, is a prime example of how not to regulate digital currency. Even though there are many Bitcoin startups looking to secure additional funds through online crowdfunding, very few of them attract smaller investors. The reason for this is simple: most Bitcoin crowdfunding platforms adhere to the same guidelines as regular online crowdfunding platforms do. In the end, only accredited investors are given the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin startups. Due to this recent SEC ruling, the landscape has changed for Bitcoin startups as well. Whether or not these same limits apply to these companies, remains to be seen. But online crowdfunding is becoming more and more important, and Bitcoin startups will benefit from these rulings one way or another.

Recently blockchain.info went down for maintenance for about 14 hours on October 26th. Also Read: Why is my Bitcoin transaction not confirming? Due to the recent DDOS attempts on the bitcoin network it seems that the wallet balances in the database might have fallen out of sync with the actual wallet balances on the bitcoin network.

Doing so would require either an account with funds in it or at last an exchange platform with fast deposit and withdrawal methods. The LZF Bitcoin exchange offers exactly that, and there were some interesting arbitrage opportunities already. In this day and age, Bitcoin trading has to be fast and fierce, which also means Bitcoin exchanges need to step up their deposit and withdrawal methods. Traders are not keen on waiting hours, if not days, for funds to clear before placing new orders. Using arbitrage opportunities needs to be swift, smooth, and frictionless. Not too many Bitcoin exchanges offer that functionality, but there are a few exceptions to be found. LZF is one of those exceptions, as this Bitcoin exchange platform offers USD deposits in the form of 15-minute wire deposits during banking hours. Granted, this functionality is limited to banking hours only, but it is giving LZF a competitive edge in this jam-packed exchange platform ecosystem. Late last night, there were some tremendous arbitrage opportunities on the LZF exchange platform. With a price spread of as much as US$65, Bitcoin traders could easily take advantage of the rapidly changing Bitcoin price, and have their deposits clear within 15 minutes. As you would come to expect, it didn\u2019t take long for traders to find out about this opportunity, and the window for quick profits closed rather quickly. This is why it is so important to keep all of your options when dealing with a volatile Bitcoin prices. Rather than being forced to pre-fund an exchange account balance, it is far more convenient to have deposits clear within 15-20 minutes. Especially when compared to other Bitcoin exchanges, where deposits can take up to five days to be credited. Up until this point, LZF was not a major name in the world of Bitcoin trading. However, with their fast deposit methods during banking hours, that situation might be about to change sooner or later. Traders have to make the most of these Bitcoin price swings, and LZF seems as good a place as any to do so. Which Bitcoin exchange has your preference when it comes to exploiting these price swings?

According to sources in Russia, until now, their Ministry of Finance had supported fines of around 500,000 rubles, or 1-2 years of community service, but the change in their stance might have something to do with the rising popularity of the cryptocurrency, as they\u2019re now militating for a prison sentence of 4 years, for those caught using bitcoin. What\u2019s surprising is that regardless of the fact that a big percentage of the population which has heard about the digital currency, the Russian government will reportedly go ahead and concretize the proposal. In fact, the Ministry that came up with the idea, is also supported by the ministry of Economic Development in Russia, as related by Vesti, a Russian publication. If you recall, last year, Russia\u2019s Central Bank has decided to take a careful approach towards the currency, while also closely monitoring it. There\u2019ve been numerous plans to completely ban the use of other currencies as well, apart from the ruble. The reason behind this is that the use of bitcoin and other surrogates represent a high level of risk for the country\u2019s economy. One plausible reason for the hostile attitude towards the digital currency may be the sanctions imposed by the U.S. in 2014, and in the first part of 2015. Perhaps this is why Russia is wary of its economy, and wishes to keep it pure. However, it\u2019s important for Russia to note that most governing bodies around the world are currently looking for ways to adopt the digital currency, and its underlying technology- the blockchain.

The heroes of the show were Dutch law enforcement agencies alongside with a private Russian cybersecurity firm. For those who are not yet aware, ransomware is an interesting type of attack which locks down users\u2019 computers, and demands ransoms, often paid in bitcoin in order to allow the victims to access their files freely once again. The two authors who have developed the platforms were arrested, after being tracked down by Dutch Police, and the Kaspersky cybersecurity firm. It seems like the two platforms locked computer files, then proceeded to open a window, where users were informed about the hack, and told how much money they should send, and to which address. Once 24 hours expired, the sum needed to decrypt the computer would increase by $100. Kaspersky has also managed to crack the decryption keys, which are now available for use by those affected by the two ransomware platforms. 14,000 decryption keys, which are required by users to access their blocked files, can be used alongside with a decryption tool that comes as a free download. Based on the latest reports, it seems like the two ransomware strains have managed to successfully infect thousands of PCs, thus earning thousands of dollars-worth of bitcoin. Unfortunately, there aren\u2019t the only ransomware strains operating via bitcoin. The team behind Cryptowall 3.0, a similar platform is still nowhere to be found. The authors of this platform have reportedly managed to earn around $325 million in profits from bitcoin ransom payments, after infecting thousands of computers. As Cryptowall 3.0 employs sophisticated techniques meant to throw law enforcement off tracks, it\u2019ll be a while before the authors of the ransomware strain are found and face the consequences of their actions.

Whilst the previous high to over $300 had upped the future expectations for bitcoin, it was apparent that the manipulated markets and inflated volume were to blame for causing the prices to increase exponentially in a short period of time. What we see now is the after math of the rally as prices fall back to pre rally levels and the market corrects itself in accordance to the true market sentiment. Below is the 7 day trading graph for bitcoin and whilst not much is depicted except a move further down from the mid $230\u2019s, on closer inspection it seems that the prices of Bitcoin are relatively tame when compared to increase in trading volume. Many attribute this to the huge whales which are stocking up on cheap coins as yesterday the volume increase by $1 million signaling a small rise in interest. THis new capital may strengthen the $20o range allowing for a safe and sustainable rise to the $230 \u2013 $235 range. Speculation Currently I would set a price target of $236 which is slightly on the optimistic side. Whilst a rise to this level might easily be overcome by resistance within a matter of days, current market action points towards a small increment in the price after the weekend. However the weekend will sadly bring prices down as many attribute this phenomena to miners dumping coins due to bills and other costs that they may encounter. However next week should be slightly better than the current one as the draft of negative news surrounding Bitcoin dies down. Remember never invest more than you can afford otherwise happy trading !

Now, they\u2019ve finally received official approval to open their exchange. The New York State Department of Financial Services, which has been heavily regulating NYC-based Bitcoin exchanges has decided to approve the operation of the Gemini exchange, as it follows all regulatory guidelines, while also having a similar regulatory framework to another firm which was recently accepted into the system. While there are already a couple of popular exchanges on the market, such as CoinBase, the Gemini exchange is more focused towards banks and other institutions, interested in buying and selling bitcoin. With this in mind, it has been structured as a limited liability trust company, which is the main reason why they\u2019ll be able to service both corporate companies and individuals. Following all regulatory framework was not an easy job for the Winklevoss twins, but according to a recent interview, they\u2019re confident that the exchange is bound to be successful, as long as they use firm business practices and have a complex security programs. What makes the firm different from other bitcoin exchanges is the fact that they will hold customer money in bank accounts which are federally insured, thus greatly decreasing the risk of currency theft, and improving customer security. Both corporate companies and individuals can request invitation codes, and go ahead and try the service out.

One of the main advantages of using this particular exchange has got to be their payment options. When trying out the site I found that I could deposit fiat money from a variety of sources including PayPal Webmoney and even Perfect Money.

NairaEx encorporates the security and ease of various fiat money transfer services to provide a solution to meet the needs of the majority. Whether its remittance or business, the versatility of Bitcoin and the functionality of NairaEx will make Bitcoin integration as easy as possible.

Gox CEO was just charged with embezzling the firm\u2019s bitcoin funds", "content": "We\u2019ve talked about Mt. Gox CEO\u2019s arrest in the past, when he was taken into custody by the Japanese authorities, and charged with a couple of accusations such as money laundering and more. If you do not recall, last month, Mark Karpeles was arrested by police in Tokyo, 17 months after his exchange filed for bankruptcy and had tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of Bitcoin in losses. The man is also suspected of moving money from the exchange\u2019s accounts into his own pocket. Well, the latest reports indicate that Japanese prosecutors have just charged Karpeles with embezzling the money of his clients. If convicted on this accusation, he might have up to 10 years in prison. Judging by the fact that Japan has a 99% conviction rate, it is highly likely that he will spend his next years locked up in a Japanese prison. What\u2019s surprising is the fact that Karpeles is still denying all of the accusations, and simply stating that he had nothing to do with the embezzlement of the funds. In a press statement, he said that: \u201cWhile I believe I did everything I could do to prevent this from happening, it still happened\u201d. Unsurprisingly, not many people believe his claim. In fact, a study has shown that the large majority of the Bitcoin market who are aware of this scandal suspect him of the wrongdoing. When his exchange filed for bankruptcy, it was declared that over 850,000 bitcoins were lost, 200,000 of which were later found by him. Hopefully, the Japanese authorities will soon release more information about their ongoing investigation.

With this in mind, the latest reports indicate that authorities in Taiwan have just arrested two individuals that may be in direct connection with MyCoin, which is an alleged Ponzi scheme service, but also exchange firm targeting bitcoin users. The Chinese news agency, China Times has reported that Taipei\u2019s Criminal investigation Bureau has arrested Lu Kuan-wei and Chen Yun-fei and charged them with operating a couple of the MyCoin-related events. Reports also indicate that the scam that the two members along with a few more have carried out resulted in millions of dollars in losses in a couple of Asian countries. Investigation shows that victims were duped into investing with the help of the MyCoin platform, which promised outsized results. Little did they know that this was all a Ponzi scheme and that winnings would be taken from the profit that other people made. The China Times report also notes that: \u201cChen and Lu held several events for investors convincing each one to spend NT$1.62 million (US$49,600) for 90 BTC and an account with MyCoin\u2019s parent company, which would distribute 0.63 of a bitcoin every day for a total value of NT$11,000 (US$337). The investors were told that their investment would be returned to them after just four and a half months.\u201d Taiwanese authorities have been conducting a formal investigation into the business and the two suspects since March this year, but they finally got their first big break, which then leaded to the arrest of the two individuals.

However, they have just revealed that they are likely to auction off the remaining Bitcoins in the following months, prior to the end of 2015. Not many people are aware of this, but during the Silk Road investigation, the USMS seized over 144,000 BTC, worth over $122 million in late 2013, but also more than 29,000 BTC from Silk Road Bitcoin wallets. It has been reported that the event will be the last auction of Bitcoin from the investigation, with over 44,000 BTCs being offered to prospective investors, willing to get involved with the digital currency. A USMS representative stated that they don\u2019t have an exact date planned, but that we should expect the event to be held by the end of this year. Unfortunately for some, the auction is only opened to US citizens, so foreign investors won\u2019t be able to make a move on this auction unless they have someone working for them in the States. The last auction, held in March was quite popular, with 14 bidders trying their best to purchase over 50,000 BTC. At that moment, a secretive Bitcoin firm known by the name of Cumberland Mining won the majority of the Bitcoins up to sale- 47,000. Let\u2019s just hope that during this last event, private investors will also be free to bid on the coins and hopefully get some for themselves. The auction represents a positive move from the USMS, as initially, when the Bitcoins were seized, not many people imagined the agency auctioning off these coins. Instead, many attacked it for keeping the coins for themselves, without allowing them to freely circulate on the market. While legislative framework for such a move existed, it looks like the USMS understands the importance of the crypto-market and is willing to give back to the public. Now, here comes an interesting question: Will the Japanese authorities auction off the Bitcoin worth over $350 million stolen from the Mt. Gox exchange if ever found?

This is the new stand that other Bitcoin companies are doing to make a stand against New York creating laws that prohibit the sale of Bitcoin without a virtual currency license (Bitlicense). When users from New York attempt to use Localbitfcoin.com they are shown a one-time message reading: \u201cAs of August 8th the state of New York put regulation 23 NYCRR 200, known as the Bitlicense, into full effect making it a federal offense to sell virtual currency to New York residents or businesses without a license\u201d They also posted on their blog \u201cThis new regulation would require anyone selling Bitcoins through our service to acquire the BitLicense if they sell Bitcoins to residents of New York. As the Bitlicense is time consuming, expensive and difficult to obtain for anything but large companies we\u2019ve taken the decision to protect our US based traders and not allow New York based users to use our service. This new stand has pressured other small businesses as they could not afford to comply with the new regulations designed for large companies. The Bitlicense has received a lot of negative media attention due to the number of companies that cannot comply due to the $5000 fee which does not include additional costs.However other companies such as kraken do not accept the regulations due to reasons such not providing protection from unlicensed exchanges nor does it guarantee they will receive banking services. One their blog they also commented \u201cThis is an unfortunate state of affairs and we hope that the regulation will in the future accommodate small time bitcoin sellers who do not have the possibility to comply with regulations made for big financial institutions.\u201d Hopefully New York will heed the warning these companies are providing and allow cryptocurrencies freedom again. However the few companies that will remain with their licenses will have plenty of customers and little competition in their way.", "date": "2015-08-12T17:06:48+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 12}

A supermarket chain called Jumbo have been receiving blackmail letter asking for a large sum of money in Bitcoin. The first attack occurred in May 2015 when the blackmailer left explosives in a Groningen Supermarket. However, luckily, a member of the public stumbled upon the explosives in a bucket and it was later disarmed. Police said that the bucket is commonly used in the hospitality industry. The bucket also contained a white kitchen timer. The key factor detectives have to work with is the fact that he is asking for Bitcoin rather than fiat or other valuable items. The features of Bitcoin are also quite helpful as it cannot be easily tracked and the money can be sold for fiat. The fact that the criminal has chosen to accept Bitcoins shows he has an interest in technology and has thought out his crimes very precisely. Three weeks later ,on 31st May, a local resident heard a bang, it was then found out that another explosive had been planted, at another supermarket, and had exploded. The blast did not damage any civilians but did damage a window and door frame. The police also noted that fragments of a grey timer were found. On the 5th of June, Jumbo had received another letter demanding a large quantity of Bitcoins. This letter demanded that he get his Bitcoins otherwise more attacks were to come. Police believe it was posted in the north or east of Groningen. On June the 6th, the police received an anonymous tip claiming there was an explosive device at the Groningen Supermarket. Over fears for the public, the store was evacuated and searched for hours, however no device was found. On the 1st of July, a birthday card containing a small amount of explosive dust was sent to a Jumbo store. The card also contained a further threat.The police stated \u201cWe have a lot of the pieces of this puzzle but a seemingly unimportant detail from a citizen could be the final piece that completes the puzzle\u201d.", "date": "2015-08-14T09:35:23+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 14}

Primarily, the infamous blocksize debate has escalated to an intensity that has not been previously seen. For those out of the loop, a debate over increasing the size of blocks from 1MB to 8MB has been ongoing between the core developers and the community for a considerable amount of time now. One group advocates for a hard fork to an alternative version of Bitcoin known as Bitcoin-XT that will increase the maximum blocksize to 8MB, as well as scale automatically in the future. The other side of the spectrum believes in maintaining the 1MB block limits imposed with Bitcoin Core, and instead using off-chain parties to process daily transactions, should the need arise in the future. Although many of those in favor of 1MB understand the need to increase blocksize limits down the road, they do not believe that XT is the way to go. Some advocates on either side of the debate have been willing to compromise, however the majorities in both groups can best be described as stubborn. Theymos, operator of the two largest Bitcoin forums (Bitcointalk.org and reddit.com/r/bitcoin), has been under the heaviest criticism for his stubbornness, after he banned discussion of Bitcoin-XT in /r/bitcoin, as well as censoring the subreddit to filter out all posts in support of XT. This decision has led to heightened tensions throughout the Bitcoin community, creating a divide more evident than what has been seen before. In fact, the announcement by Theymos even sparked a migration away from his subreddit. This is the first instance of major censorship on either of the main Bitcoin forums. Taking advantage of the panic and uncertainty, one trader attempt to manipulate the markets, selling 10,000 Bitcoins on Bitfinex. This order dropped the price below $170 per coin. Speculators believe the trader attempted to manipulate the market in order to purchase back the coins at a lower price. Regardless of the success, the prices rebounded within minute to what they were before the sale. However, the \u201cflash crash\u201d has since created a downwards trend in Bitcoin prices, as many wary investors have sold their coins, cautious of the volatility caused by the dump.", "date": "2015-08-20T01:39:35+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 20}

To make sure that the service is good enough, HashPool has reportedly undergone extensive testing and has taken some of the features that other top miners have and improved upon all of them. To put things into perspective, some of the robust set of features that HashPool has include GEO-IP load balance for high efficiency, one node URL, public P2Pool, public STRATUM pool meant for large mining operators, iOS and Android apps ready to use, analytics, comprehensive hashing reports, higher pay-outs, DDOS protection and more.

However, this is more of a protest move, as both Kraken and Bitfinex are strongly against laws imposed upon digital currencies.

August is off to a great start with the outlook set to be green all round as a extremely clear trend has developed in markets. Whilst the long term charts are looking pretty grim with bitcoin levels seemingly flat and lifeless the opposite is true for a short term picture. With a clear waterfall pattern emerging over the past week it seems as if the resistance posed at $275 levels has deterred any dramatic crash with many investors waiting to snap up cheap coins. As seen in the graph above it seems that the trend reversal has begun as the short term movement is indicative of slow and steady growth but for this to become established the next few days are crucial. A target of $290 is to be set for the end of the week. This figure is essential as it will determine whether the $300 barrier can be broken and will aid to remove any signal to the occurrence a further retest of lower prices ranges of $250 or $260. Whilst this may still be a possibility it can also be noted that the $290 figure may even create a double top as without the volume present we could see the former scenario playing out. Speculation The outlook is set to be sunny as bitcoin prices are set to move to the $300 barrier. There have been many times where the $300 barrier was broken in the past month but this was undermined by small trading volumes and suspected manipulation as many believed the jump up was artificial, created only to widen the pockets of the few. Many were proven right as the prices of bitcoin fell considerably back down to lows of $270 before rebounding. Whilst current prices seem low there are plenty of opportunities for traders to make money with clear Fibonacci levels and higher volumes predicting waves has never been easier. MACD and RSI indicators are also indicating a small jump as many anticipate prices of $290 to be firmly set before the $300 barrier is to be broken. It has become clear the potential for bitcoin to reach its higher values is present but it will be a matter of time till the markets and speculators alike react to developments in the technology and publicity surrounding Bitcoin.", "date": "2015-08-03T19:06:47+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 3}

Whilst this may not look like much the markets have fallen into a downward spiral as the fairly strong barrier of $275 was broken leaving way for prices to fall much further to current levels as there is simply no support for values below this label. As seen below the prices of bitcoin are currently $268 which is a drop from yesterdays values. This week has been fairly uneventful for bitcoin as it coasted along the $280+ range. However as the week closes the prices also fall. Whilst many consider this regular as miners will sell off dramatically to pay bills etc, others are considering the possibility that this negative movement may be the signal for another much stronger price drop\u2026 Speculation With few buy orders present at levels below the $276 strong hold it is likely that the current bearish activity is here to last a little longer as the market retests lower levels of $250 before a much stronger rally develops pushing the value for bitcoin once again over $300. It was clear to many that the period spent over the 300 figure was on borrowed time as the price receded to pre rally levels in a matter of days. The current market action is representative of the broken uptrend which many were referring to as a complete trend reversal. Personally, the prices of Bitcoin are likely to fall into the $260 figure which would be ideal as they are pre rally levels which are strongly supported with over $10000 worth of capital available at this level. However if the prices of Bitcoin fall below $260 another rally may not be a occurrence for a days as the amrkets repeat and rinse the regular cycle in which some make money but some don\u2019t. So its settled, $260 is the figure we will be waiting for but till then it seems that the trend may remain unbroken as the downtrend is clear and prices are still falling.

This fee is non-refundable, and for small start ups, this fee is difficult to meet. In addition to the fee, Bitcoin startups must also adhere to a 44-page document of rules in order to receive and maintain licensing. With all these requirements, starting a successful Bitcoin-related business in New York is near impossible. Tristan D\u2019Agosta, founder of Poloniex, commented on the decision. He then went in to more detail, explaining the dilemmas associated with BitLicense. The purpose of the requirements and rules imposed by BitLicense is to protect customers. However, Eric Voorhees, ShapeShift founder and early Bitcoin adopter, argued that the processes in place to achieve such a purpose actually leaves exchanges vulnerable to hackers and data breaches, which could put the customers at risk. Since its creation, BitLicense has been under heavy criticism by the Bitcoin community. BitLicense makes it difficult for innovation to prosper, and if this aggressive stance is taken in other states through America, small businesses subject to the license could be demolished.", "date": "2015-08-07T06:57:51+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 7}

The Australian Senate Economics References Committee have been looking to alter their laws to make Bitcoin transactions as similar to fiat transactions as they can.48 organisations are also said to have submitted information to the committee. However the new laws do mean that the transactions will be taxed and put up against laws as with other fiat currencies. This has had many different views as some people believe that Bitcoin should remain tax free and free for all to use without laws whilst some believe that it is a step in the right direction and that with the addition of laws and regulation it will be regarded more seriously. Their report concludes:\u201dThe committee is of the view that digital currency should be treated as money for the purposes of goods and services tax. As such, the committee recommends that the government consults with the states and territories to consider amending the definition of money in the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 and including digital currency in the definition of financial supply in A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Regulations 1999.\u201d This is a large change keeping in mind that only last year the Australian taxation office commented that Bitcoin is \u201cneither money nor a foreign currency.\u201dAlthough cryptocurrencies are still in their early stages, with Bitcoin further down the line, they are still valuable and should be taxed and kept in a similar position to fiat currencies such as the British pound, American dollar and the Indian Rupee. This means that the taxes put on Bitcoin will be used to add to Australia\u2019s federal government\u2019s taxation white paper. The Australian Senate Economics References Committee\u2019s ruling is predicted to be shown later this week and is likely going to be similar to the UK\u2019s laws on Bitcoin.\u201dIf it is defined as a global currency, this would be a positive step to encourage the bitcoin market to continue innovating,\u201d said Coinjar chief executive Asher Tan. \u201cThe Australian bitcoin market will significantly improve.\u201d", "date": "2015-08-04T19:42:30+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 4}

He also tweeted \u201ccoming soon\u2026Miketysonbitcoin.com\u2026 Changing the way we get change.\u201d This shows how Bitcoin is playing a bigger part in people\u2019s lives and is more than the nodes it began with. With celebrity endorsement like this Bitcoin is sure to grow in small steps. Mike Tyson is a former heavyweight and retired American professional boxer. He is also known as Kid Dynamite and Iron Mike. He holds the record as the youngest boxer to win the WBC, WBA and IBF heavyweight titles at just 20 years old. He has an outstanding history at winning 50 of his 58 fights and has had 44 knockouts. Bitcoin ATM\u2019s are machines which can convert from real cash to Bitcoin and sometimes even vice versa. They were first introduced in Vancouver, Canada on 29th October 2013 in a coffee shop. Since then they have spread around the world as more people have started using the cryptocurrency and are now playing important roles in ordinary lives. As of December 2014 there were 285 Bitcoin ATM\u2019s installed in the world. However the volatility of Bitcoin plays to its disadvantage as it means many banks are cautious when buying Bitcoin. Bitcoin ATM\u2019s have also had to close down due to the banks pressure. The site also notes \u201cMike Tyson\u2019s fastest knockout in the ring was 30 seconds. The Mike Tyson Bitcoin ATM can turn your cash in under 20 seconds.\u201d The new ATM\u2019s are due to launch in two Las Vegas locations in august 2015. They will feature Mike\u2019s branding which is sure to have a great impact on the publicity it gets. Mike Tyson has a huge fan base which is very global. Hopefully many of them will purchase Bitcoin as this may increase the need for Bitcoins. This in turn may push the price up even more as it is currently only $295 at the time of writing. However it soon surfaced that the sites domain owner, Peter Klamka, has had some shady dealings. Tech news site SIliconAngle (siliconangle.com) said that Tyson was \u201csuckered into a deal by a fast talker who has promised him millions if he gets involved and lends his name to the enterprise.\u201d He has a market cap of $6,780 with no products. This suggests that the Mike Tyson ATM could be a potential scam. However Klamka strongly denied these claims as he quoted \u201cthe ATM\u2019s are real and Tyson has an even split of equity due to the way the license is structured. Hopefully this will be a success as celebrity endorsement will be very useful. Nowadays there are many scams and Ponzi\u2019s so hopefully this isn\u2019t one of them.", "date": "2015-07-28T13:49:07+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 28}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-technical-analysis/", "author": "vlad adrian", "title": "Bitcoin \u2013 Technical analysis", "content": "First of all I would like to mention the fact that I am not a bitcoin trader, I only apply my way of viewing the markets to scan bitcoin and publish charts and more recently write articles here on themerkle.com. Above I have zoomed in on a weekly logarithmic chart of Bitcoin. This whole formation looks to me like a gigantic falling wedge which in theory should be bullish. However, considering the size of it, I ignore it completely and focus on the trend, which has been down for more than a year. With price back at value, as shown on the chart, and with an oversold Force Index ( which as you can see does a pretty good job on bitcoin too) the time has come to look for shorting opportunities. Lets go over to the daily chart which is where it gets more interesting. I\u2019ve been bearish on bitcoin since the beginning of March (there are some small red arrows above some candles which show my public ideas on BTC), and as you can see, my accuracy has not been great, but the key is to always be confident and persistent. Now I am bearish again (for the time being), because I believe we just had a buying climax 5 days ago, as shown on the chart. The next day bitcoin got slammed with very high volume, the highest we had in a while. I view today\u2019s price action as a test of the resistance area where the false breakout occurred. The Force Index has been oversold while the longer trend is bearish, so that gives us a shorting opportunity. If I am right in my analysis, we should see bitcoin fall back inside the 210-220 area where strong support is to be found. I\u2019ve been looking for a long time for the multi year low at 150 to get tested, but it is too soon to look for that level.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/top-three-leaps-in-the-world-of-bitcoin-over-the-past-3-years/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Top Three Leaps In The World Of Bitcoin Over The Past 3 Years", "content": "1. Price Although Bitcoin\u2019s price has been very unstable it has developed significantly over the last few years. In the year of 2013 it foreshadowed its success as its price went from being around $30 to a peak of $238. This was followed with a major increase when its price climbed to a peak of over $1,100. This was seen as the golden age of Bitcoin as many early investors had become rich as in 2012 the price was a meagre $12. This then led to dramatic events as the supply was plentiful with many wanting to unload their fortunes. As the demand decreased so did the price, and in the matter of a few months the price had dropped to around $400. With many aspirations low investors started holding on to their Bitcoin and this only led to more misery. In early 2015 the price fell to under $200 and this made some optimists predicting the prices to rise. However since then the cryptocurrency has made some progress as it is now $284.4 (at the time of writing). Hopefully it still has some progress left in it as it has attracted more investors and publicity than ever before. 2. Publicity Bitcoin has grown significantly as famous figures such as Mike Tyson and Sir Richard Branson have adopted it. It has grown from being unknown and only known by a handful of internet users to being used in pubs and coffee shops around the world. It has been used in more ways than originally thought possible and has created more jobs than ever before. Now people are using it to transfer money from countries on opposite sides of the world and people are working with others in different time zones to create new businesses. It has brought hope to masses and has inspired many entrepreneurs to create unique services that are more useful than ever in a time where technology is rapidly advancing. Many more people are using it and it is constantly growing. There were around 40,000 unique Bitcoin addresses used daily in early 2013, but now there are over 240,000 unique Bitcoin addresses used daily. This shows how more people are realizing how Bitcoin can benefit them and how the Bitcoin community is growing too. 3. Services Since Bitcoin started more and more users are realizing how some of the features of Bitcoin can be useful to them. A popular situation being where users are tipping waiters or paying for a coffee. Bitcoin can provide assistance as it has a minimal fee when transactions occur, whilst in the coffee scenario it can mean not fumbling around your pockets for change but quickly, and easily, sending Bitcoin straight to their wallet with minimal frustration. It has also inspired many new services and as Bitcoins feature improve so do the services it provides. At the start there were only a few services available where you could trade with it and sell and buy but now you can purchase gift cards, purchase technology, send money to relatives and even purchase medicine.", "date": "2015-08-03T13:07:47+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 3}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-718/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis 7/18", "content": "This week Bitcoin started with a nice bull run to a high of $317 on July 12th followed by a crash to $270 and a slight rebound. Currently the price of Bitcoin is $277. The Greece debacle was a major contributor to last week\u2019s bull run and combined with Visa and Mastercard cutting off service to backpage.com last week was a great week to hold BTC. This week has been rough with the price sliding around $15. Lets see what other traders are predicting in regards to the future of BTC. Looking on tradingview we see a mix between Long and Short positions meaning that the market could go either way. Technitian from tradingview suggests a Short position for the following reasons: Another interesting event that happened this week was the BTC-E Bitcoin market price flash crash where BTC touched $160. This does not mean that people were able to get hundreds of coins for $160 as no other exchanges crashed and there was no panic dump after. In order to cause such a crash an individual or a group would have had to have sold atleast 10,000 Bitcoins. Whether a trader rage quit Bitcoin or a poorly coded trading bot cost someone tens of thousands remains a mystery. There are conspiracy theories going around that it was planned by BTC-E itself, but until further proof is presented they remain just that \u2013 conspiracy theories. While this week has been rough I still have hope that the price will rebound right back to $290 and the bull run will continue. The fact is that new users join Bitcoin every day especially with VISA denying service to backpage.com and Greece citizens realizing that bitcoin makes a much better store of value than cash in the bank. Furthermore, Bitcoin proved to be a resilient piece of software after the latest spam attacks which only slightly inconvenience Bitcoin\u2019s users. Last but not least it is very common for Bitcoin\u2019s price to slide when the week comes to an end, and when a new week begins the price climbs up again.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/top-three-most-funded-bitcoin-companies/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Top Three Most Funded Bitcoin companies", "content": "1. Blockchain To no surprise Blockchain, one of the largest and most impactful companies, has raised a lot of support and money in crowdfunding, raising a whopping $30.5 million in late 2014. Acquiring many large investors such as Sir Richard Branson, Mosaic Ventures and Prudence Holdings in addition to many individual investors. However the stars of the show were without a doubt Lightspeed Ventures and Wicklow Capital which ultimately led to Lightspeed Venture partner Jeremy Liew taking a seat on Blockchains board. The funding was used very effectively providing Blockchain INC the necessary funds needed to expand and ultimately this has paid off as they are one of, if not the, largest companies to provide infrastructure for the Bitcoin Network, having over 1,000,000 registered wallets and over 3 million unique visitors in November 2013. In January the block explorer service reached over 1 million active user wallets. Blockchain has become the unanimous brand associated with Bitcoin and has become one of the most pivotal services introducing people to cryptocurrencies, becoming one of the most essential and one of the largest developments in the history of Bitcoin. 2. 21 Inc 21 Inc is just one of the unique startups that has really taken on the spirit of Bitcoin having raised $116 million in more than 1 fundraising round.21 Inc shook the Bitcoin to its core as it collected more than any other companies on this list and put Blockchains funding record to shame. 21 Inc is a premier Bitcoin mining hardware seller geared towards making advances into cheaper and more efficient ways to mine Bitcoin. Bitcoin miners have to keep the cost of electricity, the cryptocurrency they choose to mine and the equipment they buy to continue making profit and eventually hit ROI. The name 21 Inc. originates from the twenty-one million Bitcoins that will be produced in total by the year 2140, once all the Bitcoin blocks have been successfully \u201cmined\u201d. 21 Inc has created and developed the ASIC technology that miners need and is investing into further research to yield larger profits whilst allowing hardware to consume less electricity while mining. In addition, the $116 million they raised was over multiple rounds which are said to be dating back as far as 2013.This generally works as a better approach rather than just taking in all the venture capital at once as it allows the company to develop in multiple stages, allowing it to achieve multiple milestones and aids investor confidence. 3. Coinbase Coinbase is one of the most popular and prominent Bitcoin wallets in the industry. Being one of the most popular companies to allow users to purchase Bitcoin, it has a user friendly website designed with the sole purpose of providing information to those new to cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, and providing the best customer service to those looking to purchase Bitcoins. This has become the main reason why it raised $75 million in its fundraising. This was helped thoroughly by social media as much of the Bitcoin community was notified via it. This has pushed the value of the company to an estimated $400 million. Several different banks, NTT DoCoMo, Japan\u2019s largest mobile phone operator, and former Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit also made personal investments. Coinbase has raised $105 million since its startup in 2012 in VC funding. To conclude, Bitcoin crowdfunding is one of the most powerful and widespread ways that individual companies can raise money to improve their services and the companies on this list have explored the sheer popularity and scale crowdfunding can be extrapolated to.The unity and spirit of Bitcoin has provided a lot of help to the companies that have used it to improve and in turn improve other people\u2019s lives, such as those who are new to the cryptocurrency.", "date": "2015-08-02T14:35:44+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 8, "day": 2}

As an artist you can upload images to PhotoBTC and receive payment in Bitcoin instantly once someone purchases your photo. Unlike other popular stock photography sites which offer anywhere form a flat commision of $0.25 cents (Shutterstock) to a range between 10-60% for royalty, PhotoBTC is able to provide an 80% royalty rate which is the highest of all similar marketplaces. Furthermore, no registration is needed in order to start using the service. Navigating to PhotoBtc.com takes you to their homepage where you are able to search for pictures. I searched for Bitcoin and came up with 4 pictures. The selection could be bigger but the site was only announced last week on bitcointalk. I chose a picture that I liked and decided to buy it, the price was 0.25$ which is incredibly cheap compared to the other big named stock photography sites such as shutterstock, which charge as much as $200 a month for a license to download 25 pictures a day. If you download the full 25 pictures a day each picture ends up costing you around $0.25 but most of us only download 3-4 pictures a day, which end up costing us as much as $2 a day. The checkout process is simple, before downloading the photo you have an option to buy it for a flat fee of 0.25$ with the standard license, or buy an extended license for $25 which allows the use of the picture for over 500,000 print runs to use on commerical products such as Tshirts, Coffe Mugs, Posters, etc. After selecting your license you are able to download the picture anoymously or sign up for an account. I chose to download the picture anonymously. You are then presented with a Bitcoin address to send payment to. Wait a few seconds after sending the Bitcoin and it will take you to the final page where you are now able to download the photo. Just like that you are done! The picture I bought is the one featured in this article. One issue is that the picture appears pixelated but that is an issue with the author of the picture rather than the marketplace.

Throughout the chaos, many users of Reddit, a social network and news site, have advertised and migrated to Voat, a Reddit clone, as part of the protests. The turmoil began in response to the firing of Reddit employee Victoria Taylor. Victoria, the former communications director, was an active member of the Reddit community, and universally appreciated among users. Victoria, before being released, was the sole employee in charge of Reddit\u2019s popular AMA features. Ask Me Anything (AMA) is a subreddit within the site where the community can ask questions to celebrities, politicians, and regular people with interesting stories. Victoria was the driving force behind these AMAs, she coordinated guests, made sure the responses were genuine (as opposed as an agent acting as a celebrity), and helped out many of the special guests with reading Reddit and writing their responses. Over the years, prominent figures such as Bill Gates, Gordon Ramsay, and even President Barrack Obama have participated. Without Victoria, it will be difficult to continue to incorporate many famous people to take part in AMAs. In response to Ellen Pao firing Victoria, many of the most popular subreddits went private, prohibiting any users from viewing the contents. In addition, Reddit users signed a petition to have Ellen Pao removed from CEO. So far, the petition has over 190,000 signatures. Another response to this decision was a massive migration of Reddit users over to an alternative of the site, Voat. The framework of Voat is very similar to Reddit \u2013 users can vote for or against other users\u2019 comments and posts, and users can also create subverses, which work in the same way as subreddits. In addition, Voat is also strongly in favor of utilizing Bitcoin. Unlike Reddit, Voat plans on sharing revenue with users, by awarding well received content with Bitcoin. The site also accepts Bitcoin donations, and since the drama with Reddit began several days ago, Voat has already received more than 50 Bitcoins in donations.", "date": "2015-07-07T05:13:05+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 7}

Whilst most are written of as ponzis the very few such as Bitcoin Cloud Mining Services, gain the trust of many before abruptly shutting down operations leaving user out of pocket from amounts ranging to 100\u2019s of BTC in some cases. Just a few days ago specifically the 7th of June it was reported by a number of consumers that the cloud mining site, \u201cBitcoin Cloud Mining Services\u201d had stopped payouts to its users. Whilst there have been many other companies such as PB Mining which had bolstered thousands of BTC in investment but left many bankrupt when it closed down. Bitcoin Cloud Mining services ran a aggressive and intrusive advertisement campaign and promo particularly targeting the community of Bitcoin Talk where its adverts appeared countless times in rotation with adverts of other cloud mining sites. This ad campaign led to it growing into a huge business which when shut down, cost thousands of people money. It can be seen from the public payout wallet of the site that payouts have stopped from the mining company. There have been many users left out of pocket but no information relating to the owners of the site has come forward as of now. However the site is up and running waiting for any more unsuspecting victims to send money. Whilst address are still open for users to attempt purchase no mining power is being given to users and it is likely that the sites operations have ceased with the operator plainly maintaining the site for extra Bitcoin. To conclude with Bitcoin cloud mining services the latest company to rip of its users, the bitcoin cloud mining scene is becoming bleaker by the day. Companies such as Bitcoin Cloud Mining have been in existence near the very beginning of bitcoin and don\u2019t plan to disappear anytime soon. With rich pickings and money to be made of innocent customers, unscrupulous operators will carry on as long as users are not aware of the truth behind these websites. With LunaMine one of the last major services to run with users money it begs the question how can one distinguish from a real mining site and a fake one ? Well initially having proof that the mining service you intend to go with has actually got miners is a step in the right direction. However with many images of miners being copied from their legitimate source a quick check through google can confirm images authenticity. Whilst the number of rogue mining services running as ponzis is increasing there are still legitimate options available for those wanting to reap the benefits of cloud mining. Afterall cloud mining can provide a residual income if the initial investment is large enough and with services such as Scrypt.cc which are considered legitimate by many, the risk are low when investing.

The announcement of a vote to help decide if Greece should allow the European Union to bail out Greece caused massive amounts of Greek citizens to make a run for the bank, and withdraw their balances. The terms for the bailout included seizing the savings of citizens, as well as limiting the amount of freedom citizens had in regards to their money. In response to the bank run, many banks closed, and there are currently heavy limitations on the bank accounts of all citizens throughout the country. In response to this crisis, citizens throughout Europe looked to Bitcoin, in order to secure their savings from their governments. During this time, searches for Bitcoin within Europe increased dramatically, and transactions saw a significant increase as well. More importantly, this event led to the price of Bitcoin increasing over $20, eventually hitting a high of over $270, the highest the price has been since March. Although the action took place in Greece, it was primarily the rest of Europe who bought Bitcoin. Bitcoin purchases did take place in Greece, however many citizens are still unable to withdraw a majority of their savings, and those who have been able to, have already averted the crisis. In reality, the areas that saw the most Bitcoin purchases were countries like France and Italy, where citizens are experiencing a weak government. In times like these, citizens throughout the world look to a \u201csafe haven\u201d currency, that can ensure the labor and effort that went into accumulating money does not go to waste. For the past 6,000 years, this safe haven currency has always been gold. Surprisingly, that was not the case this time.

The event has brought a lot of positive coverage on Bitcoin, and also sparked interest in the cryptocurrency from citizens worldwide. However, Bitcoin related events haven\u2019t been 100% positive. For over a day now, an unknown entity has been attacking the blockchain through an automated Denial of Service (DoS) Attack. What this unknown attacker is doing is spamming the blockchain with dozens of transactions a minute. The perpetrator is sending miniscule amounts of Bitcoin (.00001 BTC) to 34 simple brainwallets, such as cat and dog. The entire transaction costs the sender just 8 cents worth of Bitcoin, and although the transactions are constantly being sent, the attack has been sustained for over a day now with just several Bitcoins to start with. Because so many transactions are being sent, the attacker is able to single-handedly fill each 1 MB block that enters the blockchain. As this attack is so viable due to a low block size, some speculators believe the goal of this attack is to push a block size increase. Regardless of the intent, the ease at which the attack was conducted certainly does provide evidence to support a block size increase. Although the attack has certainly been able to fill each and every block for over a day, the actual effectiveness in locking out Bitcoin users is questionable. As many users have stated, by simply increasing the transaction fee that is paid to miners by a small amount, it can be ensure that all legitimate transactions are confirmed in a timely manner. Another interesting aspect to this attack is it is not necessarily feasible in many other altcoins. By simply requiring a transaction fee to each individual output, which many altcoins already do, this attack can be avoided completely.", "date": "2015-07-09T06:30:16+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 9}

After Ross Ulbricht, the person running Silk Road was jailed for life, an interesting report about a former US undercover agent involved in the investigation has come out. Carl Force reportedly faces up to 20 years in prison after he has pleaded guilty to a couple of charges, some of which including extortion, obstruction of justice and money-laundering. If the reports are true, then this man has stolen more than $700,000 in Bitcoin from the money that has been seized by the government, and also took bribes from the owner of Silk Road to play as a double agent and keep him informed about the status of the US investigation. At the beginning, he was asked to pose as a drug dealer who has connections with hit-men, but it turns out that he gave out some information about his real identity and asked Ross to pay him $50,000 for information about the investigation. Together with this, he also secretly solicited payment for other services and diverted all of the money to his personal accounts, instead of the official FBI accounts, thus stealing a lot of the funds.

As of now, Bitcoin is the only payment method accepted by Bitcoin. Backpage is a classified advertisement, similar to sites like Craig\u2019s List. The site offers listings in a variety of industries, including automotive, jobs, and real estates. In the United States, Backpage is the second largest classified listings website, behind Craig\u2019s List. Backpage also offers listings for \u201cadult\u201d services, which is the source of controversy between the sites and payment processors. Although the site officially prohibits the listing of illegal services, such as prostitution, however that hasn\u2019t stopped its users from soliciting sex to anonymous buyers. Backpage monitors its adult section for advertisements offering illegal services, and informs law enforcement of any listings attempting to solicit underaged sex. Regardless, Backpage is still responsible for 70% of all prostitution advertisement that occurs between 5 websites that offer adult listings within the US. Backpage has been under controversy for allegedly fueling the sex trafficking industry within the US. The decision for MasterCard to discontinue support to Backpage came after heat from Illinois law enforcement. Discontinued support from MasterCard and Visa was intended to cripple the site, and force it to remove the adult section completely. However, the actions taken by the payment processors did not have the intended effect. Rather than shutting down, Backpage users simply began paying through Bitcoin. A majority of Backpage users did not use Bitcoin prior to this decision by MasterCard, but that did not stop users from adapting. For many independent sex workers, leaving Backpage means taking their work to the streets, a much more dangerous alternative. Although many users had no prior knowledge of Bitcoin, the ease of the cryptocurrency and support of the community has made the transition relatively painless, and many are learning the advantages the digital currency holds over credit cards already.", "date": "2015-07-11T06:25:55+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 11}

BTCjam is a pioneering bitcoin peer-to-peer lending company that is aimed at serving the needs of borrowers in the developing country who are unable to borrow from traditional lenders without running afoul of predatory lending practices, and which do not have a national credit scoring system similar to that in the US. BTCjam functions as an online marketplace that matches bitcoin holders with those seeking secure loans. Lenders can earn interest of as much as 19.3 percent on the loans they provide. As of end-2014, BTCjam has already facilitated some $10 billion in bitcoin loans and has over 100,000 users from all over the world. It has also developed an online credit scoring system that allows borrowers to build a credit profile that would qualify them for loans. Borrowers can improve their scores by ensuring that their personal information as well as their social accounts are verified and through credit activity on the site. Epiphyte is a provider of software solutions that allow traditional financial services companies to integrate their systems with cryptofinancial networks. The company was one of the winners of the Innotribe Startup Challenge, which was held on October 2014, and took home a $50,000 prize. The Epiphyte software allows companies to convert local currencies to bitcoin, make secure international transfers and then cashes the bitcoin out in the currency of the receiving country. The transfers are made for a fraction of what traditional money transfer companies charge, using bitcoin exchanges such as BitPay and Coinbase, which shoulder the currency risk. In addition, the integration is made using SWIFT and other traditional protocols. The company is set to roll out a pilot implementation of the software in 2015.

Since then, it has rebounded to it\u2019s current price of $227. While the chart remains optimistic in the short term, it looks like the market is still looking for support after the breakdown. vlad.adrian\u2018s bitcoin price analysis from Tradingview suggests: and provides the following chart: The bulls must keep the momentum and act fast in order to sustain the uptrend in the past 4-5 days. However, no major support has still been found and the bears can drag the price lower. The problem with another major pump is the fact that on the come up miners will dump their enormous holdings of bitcoin. In China, it costs roughly 800 RMB to mine a bitcoin. 800RMB is $130 which means that if bitcoin ever went to $1300 the miners would exhibit a %100 gain. All miners aside we can see some action on btc-e. If the bulls keep on pushing then the price could go up past $240, however, if the bulls keep dragging the price down and keep it below $240 then it looks like the price will find a new support line.

However the BitStake trading platform is out to put a end to all that providing a unique and secure platform to match the needs of the everyday trader and even the seasoned trader. Whilst remittances might be the main product for others there is the trading platform. While in a early stage of development the trading engine currently accepts Bitcoin, BitStake and Nigerian Nairas. On first glance the engine may look slightly empty but under the hood technologies have been used to provide a complete and seamless experience. With the order book buzzing with activity all data is updated in real time providing traders with trigger fingers various opportunities to make profit along the way. Currently there are various ways to take advantage of the tools provided by BitStake to turn over a profit. Even if you are not a seasoned trader this advice still applies but carries the same risk as any other advice and investor will give. Trading is a risky business where losses can ruin your financial state so this advice is to be taken with a pinch of salt. With that out of the way lets get down to basics. Simple principles of economics are still applicable to Bitcoin markets and the buy low sell high rule is no exception. This is the simplest way of turning over but the graphs provided over on the BitStake engine should help you to see any patterns and help predict and pitfalls. The order book was next on my hit list and it too becomes a valuable resource in the hands of the experienced. Seeing the selling pressure and buying movements can help to predict in conjunction with daily highs and lows, when and where to strike as if the prices are nearer to the higher end and sell orders have a large volume it may be a moment to consider when to pull out. On the other hand seeing low prices are also to be taken advantage off as a low price often becomes the signal for a small movement upwards as the market follows the natural pattern for correction. Whilst many will be bewildered and stick to holding bitcoin, which is a good investment in its own right, the trading engine at BitStake may entice you for a occasional spot of trading. With trading made transparent and simple there\u2019s no reason to deposit a few Nairas and make some money. To conclude whilst remittance aspect of the BitStake platform has been its driving force since its launch, the trading platform also associated with the brand has become a jewel in its own right. Providing the essentials needed to profit and providing the tools to hone your skills , the trading platform has developed into a neat utility. BitStake are committed to providing the complete package to a trader and from first glance its not looking too shabby when compared to the likes of Bittrex. However the bigger the platform grows the more problems it will encounter, but the staff have proven themselves as talking one staff member allowed me a small peak into the friendly and co operative atmosphere you can expect when dealing with BitStake.

IT specialist Guido Rudolphi, one of eight people involved in the project, said they have spoken with investors and are already scouting for suitable premises for the bank. If the project does materialize, it would result in an institution that would allow its clients access to conventional banking services while still raising revenues for the cryptocurrency industry. In addition, it would allow bitcoin exchanges to offer their services in Switzerland without the need to pass through foreign banks. While no further details on the project were forthcoming, it is seen as an encouraging sign that Xapo recently decided to transfer its headquarters to Switzerland in order to take advantage of its regulatory stability as well as its secure cold storage vaults. Xapo specializes in bitcoin services and security and has been called the \u201cFort Knox\u201d of bitcoin due to its cold storage vault servers, which offer secure storage of their clients\u2019 bitcoin holdings. The company made the move due to the concerns of its clients over increased regulation and oversight over the cryptocurrency in many countries. Switzerland was chosen due to its long-standing tradition of respecting the privacy of depositors in local banks as well as its neutrality and regulatory stability. However, Xapo CEO Wences Cesares said the move was not intended to abet criminal activity and customers who perform suspicious activities or do not conform to Swiss law will be reported to the proper authorities. In addition, those who cannot provide adequate documentation proving their identities will not be allowed to open accounts.

Let\u2019s start of with our key 242 level from Last Week\u2019s Bitcoin Forecast. When we look at this key level, we see that at first, it provided resistance, as we talked about last week. After a short retracement, the bulls came back even stronger and blew out that level. Since then, bitcoin has been making higher highs as it consolidates and settles down. Recently, we have seen bitcoin consolidating above our 242 level which is a very good sign. Moving out to a daily chart\u2026 There\u2019s a lot to see here. First off, for the first time in a while the 9 EMA is crossing and stacking above the 18 EMA indicating bullishness. Stacking is a term used to refer to the velocity at which two EMAs move away from each other. The faster they spread away from each other indicates the strength of the move. Here, we are stacking nicely. A bullish sign. Secondly, the green areas illustrate that the 213 low may be a long term low in the bitcoin market. We can see this because the market has put in a higher swing low on the left and a higher swing low on the right. This structure indicates a bottom in the market. Combined with the stacking EMAs and the bullishness at the 242 level, it looks good for bitcoin. Lastly, we can see resistance is turning support as bitcoin continues to take out old highs and make higher lows. So what\u2019s going on for this week? Let\u2019s look at some price targets and play out some scenarios\u2026 For this week, upside targets are 254, 260, and 275. 275 is a huge weekly level and should definitely see some profit taking if we are to reach there this week. 254 and 260 are daily levels that are easily reachable this week. As for down side targets\u2026 If bitcoin were to fail at 242, it may be reaching for an Optimal Trade Entry long denoted by that grey bo at 235 to 231. If price were to break past that, we would need to reconsider our trading bias as a bull for the week.

A tweet from the official bitcointalk twitter explains why the forum is down: According to a message on reddit from theymos it looks like the attacker only had access for 12 minutes and it is unlikely that he was able to get a complete dump of the db. Another message was posted on the bitcointalk twitter account: Compromised password hashes means that your actual passwords have not been revealed but their hash has. What that can do is link passwords across different accounts. For example the most common password hash algorithm is the md5 which is used to store a one way hash of a password. The md5 hash of the password \u201cabc123\u201d would be \u201ce99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03\u201d. It is a good idea to change the password on any accounts that used the same password as your bitcointalk account because an attacker can try to access your alternate accounts by authenticating to the server by sending packets of your hashed password and username. A Social Engineering attack against the ISP means that the attacker was able to obtain the administrator\u2019s personal information and used it in order to compromise the admin\u2019s account. Such attacks are common against celebrities whose personal information is commonly leaked. This article from the washing post shows how easy it is to hack someone\u2019s iCloud. It is actually how most if not all celebrity photos were obtained. Some ways to protect yourself from a Social Engineering attack is by safeguarding even inconsquential information about yourself, lie to security questions so that the answer comes form memory and not from an event. View any password reset email with skepticism even ones that say \u201cIf you didn\u2019t request it, don\u2019t do anything\u201d. Try to find a way to watch you account\u2019s activity and log such infrmation as logins + IP address.

However it comes as wonderful news as a court in Russia has successfully uplifted the bans on cryptocurrency websites which were previously put in place nationwide. Below were some of the specifics of the court case which was held today decided that Bitcoin related websites and material would now be legally accessible in the country. The previously controversial ban proved to be a roadblock for many Bitcoiners around the country and also further helped to deter prospective investors willing to explore the benefits of Bitcoin. source \u2013 bits.media There have been many reasons behind the uplifting of the ban including the fact that many other countries were already regulating the use of Bitcoin whilst Russia had initially banned the coin. The fact that Russia was left out of the picture was one of the main reasons and contributing factors to the judges decision to lift bans and allow information to circulate freely. To conclude Russia will finally see the full benefits of Bitcoin as the decision to overturn the nationwide ban on Bitcoin and crypto related sites was overturned. This monumental decision is thought to have lasting effects as now millions across the country have gained somewhat advanced and deeper connections into the Bitcoin network. Websites are just as important to the growth of Bitcoin as are BTM\u2019s and other pieces of hardware which can be credited to the growth and rising popularity of Bitcoin.

This is most probably the result of the recent geo-political tensions and unwise moves that Russia has been carrying out for the last year, both in its own country, but also in orders. Yes, we specified that China has welcomed Bitcoin with a positive attitude, but we weren\u2019t talking about the government, which went ahead and imposed a ban stating that those who work with banks are not allowed to have any relation to Bitcoin and other digital currencies. However, we\u2019re happy that no other ban was imposed here, as China represents the world\u2019s biggest market for digital currencies. Over here, the central bank of the country has declared that it is illegal for any resident to use a currency that is not issued or controlled directly by a government or an authorized entity. While not referring strictly to Bitcoin, all other currencies apart from the traditional ones are prohibited. Sweden is often seen as a land of freedom, where people can make their own choices and the laws are quite permissive.

Many arrests were made after homeland security identified a Darknet weapons seller and exposed the trades done in the dark dooms of the internet. Following the six month investigation many international buyers of firearms and weapons were arrested. $80,000 worth of Bitcoins was seized in the operation and homeland security believes they will be able to clean up the darkest corners of the web and stop illegal activity on the internet. HIS agents used a fake username to identify future buyers of the illegal firearms and followed up with multiple arrests. The Darknet is an anonymous web market where peer to peer transactions are made and many of them for illicit purposes. The Darknet also expands into smaller marketplaces where products can be viewed and shared from the comfort of their own home. This bust was made on the marketplace \u201cAgora\u201d and the fact that it is so widely spread and peer to peer makes it almost impossible to trace. Real names are not used and the product is shipped worldwide. It is also very secretive and similar to the pirate bay as they are all hidden and hard to remove and censor. However homeland security managed to infiltrate this secret society which always seemed very unlikely as information was only transferred between close \u201cfriends\u201d and never openly. \u201cFour illegal firearms, ammunition, two clandestine laboratories, precursor chemicals, methamphetamines, pseudoephedrine, steroids, computer equipment and mobile telephones were seized,\u201d according to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). \u201cOn a global level, the operation led to 17 arrests across the United Kingdom, Europe and North America. These arrests resulted in the further seizures of firearms, ballistic armour, illicit drugs and $80,000 in Bitcoins,\u201d a customs statement said. In the future HIS agents hope to be able to track down more illegal sellers and stop the Darknet being out of the governments control and free to do as it pleases. The Darknet has been an illegal yet completely unstoppable force as it is virtually impossible to discover who is doing what. This investigation also highlights that no matter how complex cyber criminals become Homeland security will never be too far. Many cyber criminals believe as it is online it is impossible to track but whenever a click is made it is all still there like a cyber-footprint that can be used to identify the individuals behind these acts of unlawful activity.

A swing low is defined in the charts as a down candle with a higher low on both sides. This may be signalling that bitcoin has put in a longer term low and is poised to break out and move to some higher targets. With this higher timeframe in mind, we can guide our decisions to look for buys knowing that a strong uptrend is behind us. Next, let\u2019s look at daily key levels for bitcoin that may provide support and resistance if and when bitcoin should reach these levels. I consider these price levels to be highly sensitive meaning that price is likely to react should price reach these levels. It is good to mark up your charts with higher timeframe levels to start every week to guide your decisions for the coming days. Bitcoin has been blasting up and is under resistance at 242. We have to consider that bitcoin may need to correct and reach for a retracement into the 61.8% fib level, but also keep in mind that the higher timeframe is pulling bitcoin up, so we gotta be on the look out for signs of bitcoin moving up. A couple last things: If you have not done so already, Open an OKCoin Account. OKCoin is the most liquid and most versatile BTC exchange out there, and I personally use it. I also do a weekly forecast every week, and I have a bitcoin training series to check out. Here is a more in depth Bitcoin Weekly Forecast that I have made for this week: Until Next Time, Good Luck and Good Trading", "date": "2015-05-05T16:28:47+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 5}

That was exciting. Now, we gotta see if we will enter a sluggish hangover phase or continue to the moon. To recap yesterday\u2019s ideas: We noted the ascending wedge forming in bitcoin which usually means that buyers are coming in a buying the dips harder and harder as price approaches a resistance level. Usually, this leads to a huge break out as buyers over power the sellers at a key level and leave everyone out of position racing to get on the right side of the trade. The 240, 252, and 262 levels haven\u2019t been hit yet, and I see no sign of bitcoin slowing down. 252 is a very significant and likely target for bitcoin to reach to. How much price will retrace is uncertain. It could be a little and it could be a lot. This is why bitcoin price action is so crazy. These crazy pumps will happen and send price vertically upwards, leaving a whole bunch of traders confused. Generally, the heavy buying is a result of smart money with deep pockets entering the market, and when they enter the market, they are not looking for scalps. I think a significant upswing in price is in the cards for bitcoin over the next week or so. Here is a really good chart for the bulls. For the first time in a long time bitcoin is posting bullish market structure on the daily chart. As you know, the higher the timeframe, the more significant the information becomes. The daily chart is the #1 go to chart for smart money, so you should definitely be incorporating it into your analysis. Market structure is basically a way to measure the market. A market consists of price swings and retracements. When the market is making higher highs and higher lows, this is a bullish market structure. Structure is broken when price breaks down and creates a lower low. This could be an early sign of a bigger breakdown move forming. In this example, price has broken up and taken out that swing high at 229. 229-230 is a key level. Price may come back to test this level as a resistance turned support type of play. Overall, this is exciting for bitcoin. Price has broken out and we should expect bigger ranges and more volatility in the near future. Just keep your cool and focus on long opportunities because bitcoin has proven to be strong. Good Luck Good Trading!", "date": "2015-04-22T17:10:22+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 22}

However, there are certain inquiries that Google may not be able to find the answer to, so this is why sites like Bitfortip can turn out to be extremely useful. Bitfortip represents a start-up site that has a great idea backing it up. It\u2019s practically a platform where people from all around the world can ask and answer questions, while being rewarded bitcoins in return. To put things better into perspective, a user can go ahead and fund their account and then proceed to ask a question and put a bounty on the answer. Once a couple of answers are received, the user can then go ahead and reward the person who has offered the best answer with the bitcoin bounty. Not only can this prove to be extremely useful in situations of all kinds, but it can also prove to be an interesting way of earning money for those who enjoy spending a lot of their time on the internet. An example of the site being used may be the following: a person found a plane ticket from Rome to Berlin for the price of $300. He now wonders whether there\u2019s any cheaper alternative, so he goes ahead and posts the question over on Bitfortip and offers a 0.1 btc bounty. Once someone finds a cheaper alternative, they will then be granted the amount as promised. The site itself is fortunate enough to have a great user interface, which can further improve its potential. Chances are that once word is out about this site, a large number of people will go ahead and join it, in order to ask and answer questions, while being rewarded bitcoins in return. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, what do you personally think about Bitfortip? Do you think that the idea behind it is great?

Currently, we are still taking a breather from that huge surge up on 4/20. Let\u2019s get into the charts 228-229 is a key level for bitcoin. It is both the 50% fib retracement and the location of a significant previous swing high. Once that swing high which was resistance is broken, it becomes a level of support. It is likely that this level will produce a bounce and present a good buying opportunity should price reach down here. Price action has been choppy and a bit confusing at times for the past week or so. Currently bitcoin is in the consolidation phase in the expansion/contraction flow of the markets we outlined in previous articles. We know that range expansion follows range contraction or consolidation so we need to be on the look out for a big move soon. As for what direction bitcoin is headed, that is a good question: 242 is a very significant level as is 228, so bitcoin is sandwiched in between two key levels. Price will have to contend with these two levels and make a decision as to where it is going to go for a longer term trend. The battle fought in between this range is going to set the stage for a longer term move in price. As it stands, bitcoin is ranging, and it is best not to force any moves. One solution to fight boredom in the market and become a better trader is to expose yourself to more markets. When bitcoin is flat, I like to trade other markets that are providing trading opportunities every day. This leads to more experience in the markets faster and more improvement. You should check out \u201cThis Site Here\u201d that opens up access to the FX, commodities, and stock markets to you with an account you can fund through bitcoin. It will result in you getting more market experience, and not overtrading bitcoin in a sideway market. Also, it\u2019s a hedge to spread your bitcoins throughout a couple exchanges in case one were to get \u201chacked\u201d. Anyway, that\u2019s all I got for the bitcoin market. It\u2019s a bit choppy and a bit uncertain as we are in the middle of 2 very key levels. We will need to see a bit more price action to determine which way this is headed, but definitely keep an eye on 228 as a potential low risk buy with profit targets at 242 or vice versa for bears who are looking to short.

With the core mechanics the same, Rollin has gone for the tried and tested formula of Dice. However don\u2019t be fooled as Rollin doesn\u2019t attempt to stick to the conventions laid out by other dice sites as the site has opted for a much more modernised and sleek feel to make playing Dice a seamless and quick experience, which can\u2019t be said for the majority of other dice sites. Initially i was greeted by the frontpage of the site. A automatically created account was ready and the fun could begin. The site has integrated a amazing GUI worth of acclaim with a dark and warm colour scheme to make you feel right at home. The design of the site doesn\u2019t take much away from the actual Dice experience as all features have been designed to be straight down to the point. The core mechanics of the site are extremely functional and contain the tools needed for a complete dice experience. With the controls in easy reach sand the keyboard shortcuts available, playing dice has never been easier. Now you can act on impulse even faster ! The Robot provided by the site is a great way of automation as it encommpases many of the features offered by 3rd party bots on other Dice sites. Moving swiftly onto the community surrounding the site. Whilst there are Dice sites much superior to Rollin in terms of popularity, no site comes close to the thriving community of Rollin. Once peek in the chatter box, and i was pleasantly surprised. The spam which normally plagues other Dice Sites was not present and the chatter box was used for its original purpose, to chat. Final Verdict : Aesthetics \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f The site has a overall friendly and warm feeling allowing the player to comfortably sink into a fun session of gaming. Community \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f The community on the whole is great compared to other dice sites. HOwever there are the odd spammers and hackers but Rollin does take precautionary measures to deal with everyday problems. Customer Support \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f One of the most responsive and friendliest customer support staff experienced. Some of the big names in Bitcoin dice may want to take not here. Functionality \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f The site has all the tools needed for a good gambling session. With keyboard shortcuts also included what more could one need ! Site navigation is one area which could be improved but it isnt much of a nuisance when betting. To conclude, Rollin aims for a unique and community based experience with a unique spin on dice which will leave you coming back for more, much more. With a close knit community willing to help and a customer service that is insistent on seeing smiles all around i had no choice but to be absorbed into the fun and mayhem on the site. The sites technical aspects have also been ranked as being more than satisfactory with the cases of missing or hacked accounts only seen on a rare basis. If there is one qualm i have about the site, it may be the menu. Slightly small and discreet it may be overlooked by many new users. However thats not much of a complaint considering the sites GUI is one of the best in the current Dice scene. A simple change of colour and size for the menu would push it close to perfection but it hardly takes away from the adrenaline and fun experienced even with small amounts being risked.", "date": "2015-05-05T16:50:40+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 5}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-trading-price-analysis-for-419/", "author": "baller trader", "title": "Bitcoin Trading: Price Analysis for 4/19", "content": "What\u2019s up traders, It\u2019s Sunday, but bitcoin doesn\u2019t rest, so let\u2019s get into it and look at this triangle: Currently bitcoin is tightening it\u2019s range in this triangle. This formation occurs when price makes higher lows and lower highs in a range and signifies that range is compressing and getting ready for a powerful breakout. Bitcoin has been a bit wierd lately. The last chart pattern, the bear flag we talked about 2 days ago, did a couple fakeouts before returning to baseline. Price is potentially gearing up for a big move. As for what direction we are headed, we can\u2019t be too sure until we break down this price action further on a 15 minute chart: As we break it down, we see some resistance confluence at the top end of this pyramid. Confluence is basically when you have multiple reasons come together to form a decision. Here, price is at the top of the triangle as well as it is approaching an intraday resistance level which may signal that price is going to dip back down into the triangle. We have to be wary of seeing price breaking out of this triangle and resistance would lead to a move to 230. A basic law of the markets is that the longer price contracts and consolidates, the bigger the breakout will be when it eventually does. This is because at consolidations, buyers and sellers are an agreement between price, and the longer price stays at a certain level, the more transactions can be made. The more transactions that can be made at a certain price level is going to pair more and more people with the wrong side of the trade, so that when the market does breakout into one direction, there will be a lot more traders with losing positions and a lot more panic and volatility as traders scramble to relieve themselves of their underwater positions. By mapping out our charts like this we can see the key levels that may result in momentum shifting to one side. One last thing: Here is an explaination of why price has found a sticking point at the 224 level. You notice how the body of the candles for both January and February rest at 225. Now we are back here again. One huge tenant of trading is that the higher the timeframe you are dealing with, the more significant of a level it is. We can see everything that we have talked about in this article is proven in the 3 monthly candles in late 2014. For 3 months strait, price rested on that 230 level, ultimately snapping and moving drastically lower. This is a first hand look at how 1. Higher time frame levels are very significant in price and 2. The longer price spends testing a level, the more volatile of a reaction it will see. Now, in April 2015, we are in the same situation and the monthly candle is testing a significant price level for the third time. I can\u2019t say for sure just yet where price is going, but in knowing the higher time frame analysis and keeping our eye on intraday level for clues, we empower ourselves to be in a position to catch a huge move. Let\u2019s catch that huge move, Good luck, good trading", "date": "2015-04-20T03:47:51+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 20}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-trading-price-analysis-for-418/", "author": "baller trader", "title": "Bitcoin Trading: Price Analysis for 4/18", "content": "What\u2019s up traders, Back again with the daily bitcoin breakdown. Yesterday we saw price do a couple fakeouts of the bearflag we talked about, ultimately returning back to the original consolidation level. Now, we are teetering along support trying to make new highs. Here, we can see that bitcoin dipped into that 62.8%-79% sweetspot that we like to see on our fibs and then bounced strongly to the upside. 224 is a key intraday level that bitcoin must break to gain upward momentum and start a bigger bull move. Consolidating and holding this 222-223 zone would be a nice indication that bitcoin is poised to take out those 224 highs and move higher. However, price at the 223-222 currently does not look very strong, and it may be preparing to break down and dip back into our fibonacci sweet spot levels. This result would still be a short term bullish scenario as long as the 218 lows were not taken out. Now, if price is to go below 218, then our daily key price level at 215 is a prime target. 215 is a huge price level for bitcoin, and a break of this level would spell very bad news for price. But there is some evidence that may suggest that bitcoin could be building up for a reversal. An important thing to know about reversal patterns in general is that they take longer to form than continuation patterns do. If price can consolidate for a while, it is usually a suspicious sign that the trend may be changing and gearing up for a breakout. There\u2019s a lot to be excited about with this daily chart: So, when we look at the daily chart we see that price has entered into our sweetspot retracement level. I say to ignore the Coinbase pump wick because it is basically an abberation. Furthermore, we see that price has reacted bullishly upon entering this area at a previous key level of support. Currently, bitcoin is trying to put in a higher high which would add even more confluence to the bullish behavior seen in price at these levels. Overall, if price can hold here for a couple more days, then we are looking to get a significant bullish reaction off of 215, but like we said earlier\u2026 the reversals take longer to form than the contunations. The safe bet as a bull is to take a couple days and look at intraday resistance levels being overtaken and turing support. This is a good indicator that buyers are interested in bitcoin at these prices. Then you can confidently make your move and scoop up some bitcoins. Bears need to really be wary if bitcoin were to stop and consolidate in this area, and not marry the position. Bears need to see price break down soon or else they could be in trouble. That\u2019s it for this report, but I\u2019ll be back tommorrow, Good luck, good trading.", "date": "2015-04-19T14:18:56+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 19}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-trading-price-analysis-for-417/", "author": "baller trader", "title": "Bitcoin Trading: Price Analysis for 4/17", "content": "What\u2019s up traders, This Friday is going to be extra sweet because it\u2019s the weekend, and we didn\u2019t get scammed by OKCoin. If anyone missed out on the bitcoin action last night: OKCoin weekly futures horribly malfunctioned at settling time causing price to rocket to 284 leaving many traders with short positions with negative balances in their accounts. OKCoin promptly shut down the site and rolled everything back, essentially calling a re do like a kid on the kickball court. Anyway, let\u2019s get into the charts starting with bitcoin\u2019s hourly intra day levels As a bull, we really want to see bitcoin break that last high at 224 and continue to make higher lows. This could be an early sign of bullishness. Still, we have to be cautious because a small move up may simply be a retracement day\u2019s high at 229 before resuming down. As a bear, we are looking at current support at 222-220 breaking down. If this happens, we would be reaching for the daily lows at 216 and possibly taking them out. Next, let\u2019s check out this bear flag: A Classic harmonic chart pattern is the bear or bull flag. It occurs when price breaks decisively in a certain direction, stops to consolidate for a bit, and then continues on with another decisive move. We may be seeing a bear flag in bitcoin right now with price being in the consolidation phase. Another cool thing about the bear flag formation is that we can measure the first leg where price moved down, and expect an equal reaction in price if the consolidation were to break. We are seeing some good confluence in the target of 215 which is the projected second leg of this bear flag as well as a key daily support level. OVerall, after such a turbulent couple days and with the shock of the OKCoin glitch last night, Bitcoin needs to consolidate and mellow out a bit before it can turn bullish. If bitcoin can\u2019t hold these levels, there may be even more panic in store as we go on to test 215 and possibly 200. Moving sideways for a couple of days and making higher lows would definitely be a good sign, but I don\u2019t know how confident we can be in bitcoins ability to move up with all the bad downward momentum going on. I haven\u2019t seen enough volume to the downside to signify a reversal is in play, but I am always on the look out. If you want to be bullish on bitcoin, wait for the highs at 230 to get taken out and safely buy a retracement, otherwise, look for exuberant selling volume to push prices far below fair value and make your move.

Whilst Amsterdam and other cities in Europe are striding towards Bitcoin adoption, it seems London too is hoping to join the trend as it continues to expand its infrastructure to cater for a ever developing Bitcoin economy. Britian has long been one of the favourites to embrace Bitcoin technology as many politicians have also acknowledged Bitcoin\u2019s power to revolutionzie payments and the concept of a currency in many ways. However it has come as a surpirse as London has been highlighted as one of the most Bitcoin freindly places in the country. With the number of establishments already taking up Bitcoin as a form of payment increasing by the day, the capital has become a attraction for Bitcoiners all around the world as the drive for adoption and adaption is particularly heavy. As seen last year, companies located in the UK have been largerly successful in raising capital and are among some of the most desirable to invest in. With UBS currently exploring its options in the Bitcoin feild it has also come as a shock as the government too are willing to invest in Bitcoin. With the political and financial implications of Bitcoin thourouighly explored, London has become the Bitcoin hub of the UK catering for all including industrial and retail oriented businesses. London is yet to be bound by restrictions and regulations which may have slightly stifled the development and adoption of Bitcoin in other countries such as the US and Australia which have both taxed Bitcoin slightly stifling it. London has been seen as the home of the free, dedicated and persistent Bitcoiner as the Number of BTM\u2019s in the capital has risen sharply to accommodate a larger Bitcoin Userbase. To conclude London is slowly but surely taking steps to secure its place in a world embracing the technology of Bitcoin. With a huge number of establishments currently allowing for a Londoner to spend his Bitcoins in real life it may be a matter of time till legislation is passed similiar to laws put into place in the US, which will help regulate and stimulate the use of Bitcoin.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-trading-price-analysis-for-420/", "author": "baller trader", "title": "Bitcoin Trading: Price Analysis for 4/20", "content": "Sup brahs, Bitcoin is trying to get high on 4/20 hehe. Let\u2019s take a look at this wedge pattern that seems to be giving bitcoin some juice. So, the idea with a wedge pattern is that price is making higher lows which shows that buyers are coming into the market and buying up the dips. Meanwhile, resistance is holding at the 226 price level. Eventually, price will smash into that resistance level and buyers could take over. We are very close to this happening, and if bitcoin could break up out of 226 then we could be headed significantly higher. We have been talking about how the longer a market consolidates usually brings about a bigger breakout, so let\u2019s look at some potential 240, 252, and 262 are key resistance levels should bitcoin break out to the bullish side. We have talked a lot in the past about the 215 and 200 downside targets. Overall, bitcoin is in a very choppy, range bound market right now and it is behaving pretty odd. The best bet would be to wait for a clear break out of 215 on the downside, or of a 230 breakout on the upside. You will miss some of the move, but price is only 8 dollars away from those targets anyways, and it does pay to be careful and not force trades.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-trading-price-analysis-for-416/", "author": "baller trader", "title": "Bitcoin Trading: Price Analysis for 4/16", "content": "What\u2019s up traders, It\u2019s Thursday. We are back again, and bitcoin has finally showed some life. After breaking that 222 level we talked about yesterday, bitcoin blasted up to the 230s on some exchanges. Lets get right into the charts. Once 222 was cleared out bitcoin had room to run for a much deserved retracement. Price hit that 61.8% fib level that we like to look for on the money. The question still remains: can bitcoin continue higher? It definitely has room for another surge up, but seems to be slowing down lately. I\u2019ve mentioned before that a good, healthy retracement in a trending market is that 61.8% to 78.6% level, and bitcoin has only hit the bottom end of that range. Price could retrace higher to the 79% retracement at 233 and still be bearish, but generally any retracement past 79% of the price swing may be an early sign that bulls are taking over. Next chart looks at daily price targets moving forward: Currently, bitcoin is sandwiched in between the two daily levels: 215 and 230 shown on the above chart. If we are bullish, we really want to see that 226 level hold as support and move above 230s. Next key resistance would come in at 240, and bitcoin would be looking strong. If price gives up that 226 level, however, we will be looking for bitcoin to test that significant 222 level. If bitcoin gives up the 222 level we could be headed back down to test the bottom of the range at 215, and ultimately move down to the 200 level. There\u2019s not much else going down in bitcoin land. One axiom of the markets is the concept of expansion and contraction. After a big move up (215 to 230 is about a 13% rise in price in a couple days), price will generally mellow out and contract to digest what has just happened. The idea is that in all markets there is a cycle where an expansion in the price range is followed by a contraction where ranges get smaller, which then lead to an expansion, and the process goes on to infinity. All there is to do now is to watch these key levels. Look for early signs the may tell whether price is going to remain bullish or if the bears are back in control. In my opinion, the 79% retracement level at 233 must hold if the bearish trend is to remain intact, but a break above 233 would signal that price is on its way to 240. On the other hand, if support at 226 breaks down, price could ultimately be reaching for 215 and 200 and possibly lower. But that is far in the future, for now, we just look at the intra day levels and take it day by day.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/play-bomberman-bet-bitcoin/", "author": "Zane Huffman", "title": "Play Bomberman, Bet Bitcoin", "content": "The bitcoin gambling industry is filled with untapped potential for possible niche gambling operations. The young industry and countless benefits of bitcoin make bitcoin gambling the perfect setting for starting something unique. Despite these conditions, the industry has yet to see a skill based gambling site take off. There have been several attempts in the past, most notably Gambit, who recently discontinued bitcoin support, but none of them have succeeded. This may change soon, however, as a new service to offer Bomberman has recently been announced. Four days ago, a Bomberman clone was announced in the bitcointalk Gambling forum. A user by the name of holorga announced that he has been working on developing a Bomberman clone on his website, bitcoinlab. Holorga made it clear that the site is still in early alpha, and there are still many features planned for the future. The announcement initially received positive support, and the early players it attracted have been actively working with the developer to find and fix potential bugs. Bomberman is a widely popular player versus player puzzle game. Bomberman typically consists of four players occupying different corners of a rectangular two dimensional maze. The game starts with the maze almost completely filled in with bricks. Players detonate bombs in order to destroy the bricks, collecting power ups along the way. Eventually, players expanded their corners of the maze until they encounter others. The goal of the game is to eliminate the other players by strategically detonating bombs to hit the others. Players are eliminated once a detonation makes contact with their avatar, and the last man standing wins. There are several reasons why Bomberman is a great choice to incorporate betting. The game was first released in 1983 and has since expanded to over 70 games. As such, a vast majority of gamers are familiar with the explosive maze. It\u2019s also simple, and anyone can jump right into it and see success early on. Despite the simplicity, Bomberman also features a high skill cap. Players need to show a capacity for real time strategy, as well as spacial awareness and planning. There are many variables that go into a game of Bomberman, giving the best players a huge advantage and keeping possible bots from holding an edge over its human competition. Lastly, the game is fast paced. Each game lasts no longer than a couple of minutes, giving players the opportunity to play a lot of games in a short amount of time. As bitcoinlab is still in early alpha, there is currently no feature for wagering bitcoin. Right now, users start with 5 bitcoins worth of play money to gamble with. When bugs are fixed and the game finished, deposits will be enabled and players will be able to wager set amounts of bitcoin. The site owner has also mentioned that he plans on adding more games in the future, Bomberman is just the first. If you are interested in a new gambling experience, keep your eye out for Bitcoinlab. Although still early in development, the site has potential to become a promising option for a successful skill based player versus player gambling site in the near future.", "date": "2015-04-07T01:47:57+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 7}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-trading-price-analysis-for-414/", "author": "baller trader", "title": "Bitcoin Trading: Price Analysis for 4/14", "content": "What\u2019s up traders, Back again on a Tuesday, and bitcoin is looking weak. First thing\u2019s first, let\u2019s start our price analysis on a daily chart and look at this 14 day simple moving average. This trick was taught to me by a fund manager in the Forex markets, only he would use the 10 day moving average to capture 2 weeks of data (weekends are closed in FX). Since this crazy bitcoin market is open 24/7, our weeks include the weekends. In the above chart we can see that the 14 day moving average offers a dynamic level of support and resistance. It also offers a sort of equilibrium in the market. When bitcoin\u2019s price gets too far away from this 14 day moving average, it is likely to snap back. Think of equilibrium like an unstretched rubber band. When price gets pulled too far in one direction, it increases the ability for it to snap back toward the other direction. When price is too far away from the 14 day moveing average, we have to be careful of a correction. So, it\u2019s good to know that we may be dangerously far away from \u201cequilibrium\u201d. On the other hand, we can\u2019t forget what the famous economist John Maynard Keyes said: \u2026So we have to use more tools in our analysis than just a simple moving average. Moving down to the hourly chart, I\u2019ve marked some key price levels for bitcoin: The blue price lines are 4 hour levels and the red price lines are daily levels. It is important to use these higher time frame support and resistance levels because price is more likely to respect support and resistance on higher timeframes. Bitcoin has broken that 219.44 4H price level, and took out the old low in the process. If bitcoin cannot regain upward momentum, it is headed to that daily level at around 214 and may potential touch the 4H level at 205. One last bitcoin chart for the bears: Here, we can see that bitcoin has a habit of breaking previous lows while failing to make higher highs. This is the very definition of a bear trend and will continue as long as bitcoin cannot break old highs. Another noteable fact to pull away from this chart is the shooting star doji that price made when it tried to reach up and reclaim the 4H 219.44 level. A shooting star doji occurs when bulls buy up price to make a nice green candle, but then bears overwhelm them and sell all the way back down and then more. This is often a sign of weakness for bulls who were unable to hold at a certain price level, and the heavy rejection implies bears are still in control. That\u2019s all I got for today, until tommorrow\u2026.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/btclowen-another-dodgy-site-claiming-to-buy-bitcoin-at-premium-rates/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "BTCLowen \u2013 Another Dodgy Site Claiming to Buy Bitcoin At Premium Rates", "content": "A few weeks ago, we briefly discussed a service called My Wallet Ltd., a UK-based company looking to buy all of your Bitcoin at a 10% above-the-market premium rate. While there remain a lot of uncertainties regarding the legality of this service and whether or not you should sell them your Bitcoins, a similar service called BTCLowen has popped up. The reason I come across these weird bits of news is because, unlike most crypto journalists, I do keep an ear to the ground regarding sources that are not \u201cinside\u201d the Bitcoin ecosystem. Luckily for all of our readers, this also helps us in detecting possible scams whenever a service is offered that is too good to be true. My Wallet Ltd. and BTCLowen are operating on the same shady tactics. Buy Bitcoin at a 10% premium, use Bitstamp to determine the current Bitcoin price, and offer exactly the same payout methods for people selling them their Bitcoins. On top of that, both services cover all fees associated with these payment methods, which make it all a bit too obvious as to what is going on here. But that is not all. Both companies have released a press release on major PR sites such as PRNewswire, and they are nearly identical. According to this press release, both companies have conducted US$/GBP 2.3 million worth of transactions \u2013 during which they buy Bitcoin, allegedly \u2013 before anyone has even heard about them. Note from the Author: The original press release issued by My Wallet Ltd. has been conveniently deleted, but the URL still exists on PR Newswire. However, there are some differences to be spotted as well. Whereas My Wallet Ltd. will buy up to 450 Bitcoin per transaction, BTCLowen has set a limit of maximum 50 BTC per purchase. Plus, their website design looks slightly different compared to the My Wallet Ltd. website, even though both look far from professional. Note from the Author: The MywalletBTC website \u2013 which is the site used by My Wallet Ltd \u2013 has exceeded bandwidth limitations. Hmm\u2026 There are plenty of warning signs regarding this website being run by the same people who ran \u2013 and abandoned \u2013 the My Wallet Ltd. scheme. Similar services, nearly identical press release, same modus operandi\u2026.And the offer remains far too good to be even remotely true, as no one will buy your Bitcoin in massive quantities for a 10% premium. However, as I have not tested the service personally, it remains hard to judge whether or not these sites are scams. There is a huge possibility that you will never, ever, receive your money. But I\u2019m sure they would pay out a handful of people in the hopes of luring in bigger fish who will gladly sell tens of bitcoins at a time.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-trading-price-analysis-for-413/", "author": "baller trader", "title": "Bitcoin Trading: Price Analysis for 4/13", "content": "What\u2019s up traders, Let\u2019s start off our price analysis looking at the daily chart and plotting the 9 and 18 day EMAs. These two EMAs are tools that institutions and smart money use to measure the overall trend. When the longer term EMA (18 day) is on top of the shorter one (9), this signals a bear trend, and if the daily chart is showing signs of being bearish, it is something that we must take into consideration. If the higher time frames point down, that\u2019s going to be important information to trade with on the lower timeframes. Furthermore, we can see that the EMAs are \u201cstacking\u201d. Stacking refers to the speed and strength at which two EMAs separate from one another, and is a way to see heavy selling coming into the market. Using these two tools on a daily chart can dramatically help you stay on the right side of the trend. Next, let\u2019s look at some key price levels for bitcoin. Key levels are going to come from higher timeframe charts like the daily. We can see that 230 has just been broken (I went to make breakfast and came back to a huge dump, lol bitcoin). Our 230 support has broken, and we are looking for that to hold as resistance, next stop is 213.8 if resistance is to hold. Update: Ok, so, bitcoin won\u2019t stop dumping as I am writing. 213.8 certainly looks like it\u2019s in the cards this week. Moving on, let\u2019s get closer to the action and move to an hourly chart\u2026 The hourly chart paints a bad picture as it looks like every support has been broken. If we put in a local bottom here a retracement to 232-235 (61.8-79% fib levels) may occur, but overall the trend in bitcoin is dangerously down as there are no significant support levels until 213. It is important to note that given the recent price action and trend, we must be cautious about taking longs in our trading. The market is under heavy selling and we are not looking for higher highs to be made. Any rally is most likely going to be a selling oportunity, so setting up fibs from key swing highs and lows could give great retracement opportunities to be a seller. In summary: The daily chart is bearish. Expect the market to favor selling, and all hourly support has been breached. Another key thing to note is the bearish engulfing weekly candle, where the last weeks green candle was fully enveloped by an even bigger red candle. Now, on the flip side, if we start to turn around and start building a base and making higher highs out of that base, we could look for price to head higher. But for the next couple days, the best bet is to filter out buys from your trading and look to be a seller. See ya\u2019ll tomorrow with another bitcoin price report.

Even though Bitcoin is at a low point in its recent history it seems many charities are looking into new technology. Many charities such as Save the Children and the American Red Cross have explored into Bitcoin along with services which means Bitcoins has become a regular currency. The Bitcoin community may be feeling low but still its cheery as charities still received donations last December however the lower price meant less money was raised. In late 2012 Charities raised over $1 million which just shows how open hearted the Bitcoin community is. Many charities first started accepting Bitcoin as it has lower transaction fees than traditional fees and was faster and easier. However the unstable price can cause some problems. Save the children started accepting Bitcoin in 2013 when a typhoon hit the Philippines. BitPay takes the donations and converts it to dollars which means Bitcoin price changes wouldn\u2019t affect the donations. BitPay does not charge any additional transaction fee to charities which further helps the cause. It also means they can receive donations from \u201cthe younger pool of donors\u201d and also collect donations that they would have otherwise missed. \u201cWe want to remain contemporary and relevant to current and future generations, we don\u2019t only want to be your grandmother\u2019s charity, and we want to be your grandchild\u2019s charity. One way to do that is to accept Bitcoin\u201d Ettore Rossetti, director of social media and digital marketing at the organization. Charities also have to keep up with new ways to collect donations as trends come and go quickly but many go unnoticed by charities. On many Bitcoin forums it was noticed that Bitcoin users were raising awareness for disaster victims. \u201cRight now, accepting or not accepting Bitcoin donations is not likely to be a make-or-break decision for you, \u201caccording to Joe Garecht of The Fundraising Authority. \u201cThat being said, if your donors tend to skew younger or are generally tech-savvy, or \u2018early adopters,\u2019 accepting Bitcoin for donations could appeal to your donor base and lead to more and larger donations.\u201d Furthermore Bitcoin is gaining lots of publicity as it is still becoming used in more services and more big companies are realising the benefits. Dell and Twitch have already started accepting Bitcoin and hopefully many more will too as the ever-expanding Bitcoin community could do with more services to spend their Bitcoin on. As many more people are starting to use cryptocurrencies the services and options available for Bitcoin users are rapidly increasing. In the matter of a few years who knows how many people will be using Bitcoin and how they will be.", "date": "2015-04-16T01:00:42+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 16}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-trading-price-analysis-for-415/", "author": "baller trader", "title": "Bitcoin Trading: Price Analysis for 4/15", "content": "What\u2019s up traders, Back again on a Wednesday, and bitcoin is still looking weak. Eight out of the last ten days, price has seen heavy selling, and one must ask how much longer can it last until we see a retracement? Let\u2019s look at an hourly chart for some clues: Price is on the lower end of the range between the daily 233.55 and 214.59 price levels. Usualy we look for a 61.8% to 79% retracement within a range as shown by the fibonacci levels on the price chart. However, bitcoin is stuggling to even retrace a modest amount. This is know as \u201cstaircasing\u201d when price drops down and then goes flat with no retracement because it looks like stairs stepping down. Staircasing occurs when there is no interest at a particular price level where buyers are super excited to enter the market and cause a retracement upwards. The end result is that price will trade lower until bitcoin reaches a level where traders are willing to buy at. Staircasing also works in a bullish environment as well. In this next chart, we are looking at intraday support and resistance levels, so that we can look out for early signs of price turning bearish or bullish. Currently, price is sitting on that 219.70 level. It has broken this level but quickly regained it, but it may be an early sign of weakness. If 219.70 breaks down, we could be heading down to the 217 level, and if that breaks we will have to contend with the 215 daily level. On the bullish side of things, we are looking for price to take out the 222-223 levels to signal a higher retracement may be in the cards for bitcoin. Looking at the candles, however, bitcoin is looking weak. At the very top of the range (~222) bitcoin ran up trying to break out and was smacked down with the railroad tracks candle pattern. This is a two candle pattern where you have a big green candle immediately followed by a big red candle that completely rejects any upward momentum. This is a sign that heavy selling occured immediately after price reached up into the 222 level indicating that sellers owns this area. Bitcoin is in an odd spot right now. There are a massive amount of longs taken out on bitcoin, and still price cannot move up. One has to wonder, is this about to expode up, or are all the longs going to get massively squeezed. I can\u2019t say for sure, but I know that if we have these ideas to look at we can get an early look at what price may be doing. I expect that volatility is about to pick up\u2026 should be exciting times!

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/changetip-lovestamp-bring-bitcoin-to-the-everyday-consumer/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Changetip & LoveStamp Bring Bitcoin To The Everyday Consumer", "content": "Ever since ChangeTip entered the market of combining the Bitcoin technology and rewarding users and content alike, the world has not been the same. Not only can you tip content creators with Bitcoin across all major platforms \u2013 including Twitch, Disqus, Slack, and Twitter \u2013 but you can also show your love in physical and fun way. Everyone has heard of ChangeTip\u2019s slogan, as the company sees itself as \u201ca love button for the Internet\u201d. And rightfully so, as there has never been an easier way to reward content creators and even other like-minded people than with the ChangeTip tipping service. The fact they work with Bitcoin transactions only makes it better. And what better way to show your love than with a 3D-printed stamp? But not just any heart-shaped stamp either, but one that rewards you with small fractions of Bitcoin? LoveStamp is the platform behind this idea of a physical \u201cLove Stamp\u201d, and by partnering with ChangeTip, retailers can now show their appreciation to their customers in a physical way. However, it also brings forth the digital aspect, as users are rewarded in Bitcoin once this \u201cLove Stamp\u201d is applied to the screen of any device running the LoveStamp application. One of the best aspects of this idea is the fact that all Bitcoin rewards are completely random, adding that element of surprise for both the retailer and the customer. But there is more! When you receive love from a participating LoveStamp retailer, both the name of the retailer and your name [as a customer] will be shared on the company\u2019s social media page. And because of the integration with ChangeTip, there are multiple ways for your customers to spend their bits and pieces of a Bitcoin. One of the \u201cnegative\u201d aspects associated with anything that is related to Bitcoin is that there is always a technical hurdle to overcome. This is not the case with LoveStamp, as they have deliberately kept the 3D-printed \u201cLove Stamp\u201d simple and elegant in its design and usage. It doesn\u2019t even require a connection to the internet, infrared or NFC [Near Field Communication]. As you would come to expect from such a professional company, every 3D-printed \u201cLove Stamp\u201d is unique. All it requires the participating retailer to do is stamp the customer\u2019s \u201cStamp The Screen\u201d part of the mobile application running on their phone. Once you have done that, LoveStamp will take care of the rest. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts feel that retailers who accept bitcoin payments should reward the customers paying in digital currency in one way or another. But the more traditional reward schemes \u2013 such as loyalty cards, coupons or anything else \u2013 are hardly applicable to Bitcoin payments. A \u201cLove Stamp\u201d could be just what we need to make Bitcoin customers feel appreciated. On the other side of the medallion, the \u201cLove Stamp\u201d will also help with bringing Bitcoin to the mainstream audience. People who own a smartphone will [usually] gladly install any application from the brand or store they shop at on a frequent basis. With the implementation of the \u201cLove Stamp\u201d, these customers will be rewarded in Bitcoin, which puts our beloved digital currency in the hands of more people than ever before.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/gambit-discontinues-bitcoin-support/", "author": "Zane Huffman", "title": "Gambit Discontinues Bitcoin Support", "content": "News about bitcoin\u2019s recent involvement in new markets and industries is being shared every day. It is becoming increasingly more common to see stories about governments exploring bitcoin, companies integrating bitcoin, and people enlightening friends, colleagues, and peers of bitcoin. Bitcoin is overcoming new obstacles each week. However, there are still a lot of areas that cryptocurrency has been unsuccessful in, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge these shortcomings. Gambit is a skill based player versus player competitive gaming site. The gameplay on the site is comprised of board and card games. Until the next couple of weeks, when changes to the site are made, players can host or join one of 15 games and wager against other players for a set amount of bitcoin. Launched in 2013, Gambit has accepted bitcoin since day one. Gambit is owned and operated by a man who goes by the username Jay. Jay is also a co-owner of chess.com, a hugely popular online chess website. Jay has been running the site at a net loss since release, using his money earned from chess.com to pay out of pocket to keep the site going. Arguably Gambit\u2019s biggest dilemma throughout its life thus far has been its small playerbase. Despite hosting raffles, giveaways, bonuses, and affiliate programs, the site has never been able to attract a large audience. The name never caught on much among the bitcoin community. When a bitcoiner asked for a competitive gambling website, Gambit was most likely never the answer, for whatever reason. One of the biggest issues supporting the removal of bitcoin was the difficulty to uphold legality. In the announcement, the site stated that it was both expensive and time consuming to maintain the proper licensing throughout all 50 states in the US. This has been a recurring theme for bitcoin casinos and businesses as a whole, and is definitely something that needs to be improved upon in the near future. Another problem was a small market to begin with. In comparison to other bitcoin industries, gambling is still quite small. Many well known gambling sites struggle to maintain enough players to ensure a healthy profit, and skill based gambling is a much smaller niche within the young industry. There were also a couple of problems unrelated to general issues with bitcoin. The community was a big problem. The small, frequent players were very friendly and got along well. The problem was everyone knew everyone, and they knew who to stay away from. As a result, regulars did not bet among themselves much, but instead picked on some of the new players who were just getting into the site. Many new players did not stay long, as they were constantly beaten by players with much higher skill. Cheating is another common theme in bitcoin gambling, from either end of the operation. It\u2019s obvious that cheating is evident in the industry, and Gambit didn\u2019t have a good way to stop players from cheating the games, as some were fairly simple. For the reasons listed above, the site has elected to discontinue bitcoin support. Once the feature is removed from the site, users will have 90 days to withdraw their bitcoins. The site plans on reworking the ranking systems and releasing a system of rewards and competitive seasons. A marketing campaign is set in the near future as the company creates a new image that incorporates a much broader audience of general online gamers. It appears that the site has no plans to reenter the bitcoin world, at least not in the near future.", "date": "2015-04-01T03:56:17+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 1}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/operation-troop-aid-now-accepting-bitcoin-donations/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Operation Troop Aid Now Accepting Bitcoin Donations", "content": "If you live in the United States or watch a lot of US-based programming on TV- you may have noticed how Americans truly value their troops for all of their efforts. With one of the most active armies in the world \u2013 deployed all over the world \u2013 it is only normal to see several initiatives pop up to support these men and women serving their country. Operation Troop Aid is one of those initiatives, and they have recently started to accept Bitcoin donations. With all of those different initiatives to support men and women in combat zones, it is hard to keep track of all them. Let us begin by briefly discussing what Operation Aid Troop is and does. The idea of Operation Aid Troop began in September of 2001, making it one of the longest running troop support projects in history. However, it wasn\u2019t until 2003 until the idea started coming together. After coordinating Toys for Tots and Military Appreciation benefits, the next logical step was creating a new initiative which would eventually be known as \u201cOperation Troop Aid\u201d. With the help of a lawyer, this name quickly became incorporated and all of the necessary paperwork \u2013 IRS Non-Profit 51c3 forms \u2013 was submitted shortly after. Eventually, Operation Troop Aid was granted both incorporation and a charitable status in the state of Tennessee. After a few months, the person running the Operation Troop Aid project transferred to the state of Virginia and continued the project from there. In 2008, the project moved back to Nashville, Tennessee, and events around the country have been conducted ever since. The vision for Operation Troop Aid is relatively simple: become the \u201cpremier care package and bill assistance charity\u201d for US troops. In order to achieve that status, Operation Troop Aid will make use of major concert promotions and entertainment initiatives to branch out TROOP AID\u00ae all over the United States. However, reaching that goal is easier said than done, and TROOP AID\u00ae is looking for corporate sponsors to make that dream become a reality. But that is not all, as any form of donation is more than welcome. Donations can be made via Paypal, check, money order or Bitcoin. All donations will be used to ship care packages to US troops around the world. One care package costs US$40 to put together, and includes items such as phone cards, beef jerky, a \u201cThank You\u201d postcard and Letters from School Children. In order to accept Bitcoin donations, TROOP AID\u00ae has partnered with BitPay to process these transactions. BitPay remains the world\u2019s leading Bitcoin payment processor, and because they charge no additional fees, the company is the perfect fit for a charitable organization looking to venture into the world of digital currency. Donations can be made in any US Dollar amount, and any donation under US$40 will be kept in reserve until enough funds have been raised to put together a new care package for the troops.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-only-coffee-shop-opens-its-doors-in-manhattan/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Bitcoin-only Coffee Shop Opens Its Doors in Manhattan", "content": "There are a lot of Bitcoin enthusiasts who feel there should be some store where they only accept Bitcoin, instead of using it as an alternative payment method. While most people share that same sentiment, you have to keep in mind it might currently not be financially viable to do so. But that isn\u2019t stopping anyone from trying, as Manhattan will get its very own Bitcoin-only coffee shop soon. One of the most notably absent types of shops on the list of places that accept Bitcoin are coffee stores. Given the current nature of their transactions \u2013 most of them well below the US$10 mark for individual customers \u2013 coffee shops could benefit from the low transaction costs associated with Bitcoin. And in order to combat the Bitcoin price volatility, they can easily get their bitcoin transactions converted to fiat currency on the go. Whether or not that would be in the best interest of a coffee shop remains to be seen, as they could acquire quite a lot of Bitcoin during the course of a day. Besides, who wants to pull out cash or a credit card at a coffee shop? But what if there was a Bitcoin-only coffee shop near you \u2013 assuming you live in Manhattan that is? The project and idea have been in development for a few months now, and especially given the recent Bitcoin price decline to below the US$250 level, it was a matter of waiting for an opportune time to make this announcement. During the entire first week of April, there will be free coffee for every customer. But that is not all, as this coffee shop will also organize \u201creal life Bitcoin Faucet games\u201d to promote their venue. Later this year, there will be special competitions and prizes to be won, and people dressed up in alien costumers \u2013 no, I\u2019m not kidding \u2013 will have a slight advantage. Because this new coffee shop will only accept Bitcoin, the staff is catering to a new breed of customers. Mobile payments are in effect, as that is one of the very few ways to pay in Bitcoin on the go. AS of right now, we have not received any official word as to how Bitcoin payments will be accepted [through an application, just an address on the wall, or otherwise]. By opening this store in the state of New York \u2013 most famous for its stance on Bitcoin which could set a precedent for not just the United States, but perhaps the entire world \u2013 is an interesting decision to say the least.

If you run a company that offers a service \u2013 let\u2019s take web design for example \u2013 how would you go about billing your clients in Bitcoin in a proper manner? Invoiced, a simple invoicing platform both individuals and small businesses, now accepts Bitcoin. Let\u2019s be honest here for a moment: no one likes to do bookkeeping and keeping records of their invoices in a physical manner anymore. As a result, we have seen a booming business for digital invoicing platforms, of which Invoiced is just one. But instead of focusing on the major brands, Invoiced wants to do right by you: the individual and the small business owner. Invoiced offers a 30-day free trial promotion, so you can get acquainted with their service and see if its the right fit for you.

Not to mention, you can take full control of your revenue with the touch of a button.

Bitcoin is a very new and disruptive technology, which is impressing a lot of people, yet scaring off most small business owners at the same time. How do you go about accepting Bitcoin payments in regards to invoices? Invoiced has thought of this concern and come up with a simple solution, by integrating Bitcoin capabilities into their platform. The main advantage for individuals and small business owners to accept Bitcoin payments in the simple fact they can expand their customer base on a global scale. Bitcoin is a digital currency that works across all borders and is subject to a very low fee of 0.5% per transaction when using it through the Invoiced platform. Compare this to accepting credit cards with their 3-5% surcharge, and you can immediately see how can become more successful and generate more revenue. Invoiced\u2019s Bitcoin integration is handled by Stripe, so you will need to sign up for a Stripe account in order to start accepting Bitcoin payments. Once you have signed up for a Stripe account, make sure to enable Bitcoin payments in your Invoiced account settings. You can do this by going to Settings > Payments > Bitcoin.

Developing bitcoin into a currency that is viable for use by the average person is one of the largest obstacles the cryptocurrency has been working to overcome since its birth. Early on, finding relevant uses for bitcoin was a struggle. Today, however, more and more opportunities to spend, trade, and invest with the coin are opening up daily. Purse.io, a service that allows you to purchase goods on Amazon with bitcoin, is one such opportunity. Amazon is one of the largest online retailers in the world. Millions of people all over the world use it to purchase and ship thousands of products daily. Many people send Amazon giftcards as gifts on various occassions, and Amazon giftcards are also common rewards on a variety of earning and gift sites. Not all of these giftcards get used. In fact, there is currently 15 billion dollars worth of unclaimed Amazon giftcard balances today. Many of the giftcard holders don\u2019t use their balances because what they want isn\u2019t available on Amazon, and they would rather save. What some of these people want is bitcoin, and these people are the potential users of Purse. The site has two major features; buying goods and buying bitcoin. Users who have bitcoin, and want items from Amazon, create a wishlist and import it into Purse. After importing the items they wish to purchase, they select a discount. The larger the discount, the longer it takes to be filled. Currently, the max discount is capped at 50%. Small discounts under 10% are typically processed the same day the order is set, while large discounts of over 30% typically take a week or more to be filled. After a discount is decided, the user must deposit the required amount of bitcoin into an escrow fund held by the site. Once an order is placed, it is listed on the site dashboard, along with all other offers. From there, Amazon giftcard holders looking to purchase bitcoin can accept the order. Once an order is selected, they are redirected to a copy of the Amazon wishlist. From there, the items are purchased and sent to the address of the wishlist. The bitcoin recipient then puts a link of the order receipt onto Purse to verify the purchase has occurred. Once the bitcoin seller receives their goods, they indicate that they have indeed obtained their items on the site. The site then releases the bitcoin from the escrow fund to the recipient. It is typically not possible to exchange Amazon giftcards for bitcoin, so the card holders agree to purchase bitcoins at a premium rate, thus supplying Amazon shoppers with a discount. To promote security, first time users are limited to small buy and sell orders. As transactions are successfully completed, users gain access to higher priced transactions and more consecutive orders. Users can also receive more access through phone verification. The site has faced scrutiny about stolen credit card funds being used to purchase bitcoin. To combat this problem, Purse.io has implemented a $10,000 insurance policy to protect all buyers against fraud. Purse.io is a huge step in applying bitcoin to everyday uses. Expect more services like it to launch in the near future, as bitcoin\u2019s usage for the consumer is increasing faster than ever before.", "date": "2015-03-31T09:25:13+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 31}

Satoshi Point, the UK\u2019s leading network of Bitcoin ATM\u2019s, has expanded their services to Swansea in Wales. Satoshi Point has installed a brand new Bitcoin ATM at Caf\u00e9 Nisse, located on Wind Street [below TechHub Wales] in Swansea. In doing so, Caf\u00e9 Nisse becomes one of the very first brick-and-mortar locations to experiment with Bitcoin. Furthermore, this allows any of Caf\u00e9 Nisse\u2019s customers and employees, as well as TechHub businesses to make payments using this disruptive digital currency. \u201cI am very excited to be opening up to new methods of payment and attracting a wider catchment of customers who may be intrigued and excited by payment using Bitcoin.\u201d \u2013 Tino Dzaro, Owner of Caf\u00e9 Nisse The good news for Satoshi Point keeps trucking on by the look of it after the young company turned over 38,000GBP in one month in 2014. In fact, there are already plans in motion to bring additional Bitcoin ATm\u2019s to Wales during the remainder of the year, as there is a growing interest from potential investors. \u201cIt\u2019s a new paradigm in money. Organisations of all walks see benefits from opening up to Bitcoin; for example, the RNLI obtained \u00a32,000 in donations in the first 24 hours of adopting Bitcoin payments. I\u2019m keen to see an expansion further into Wales with the aim of seeing a Bitcoin ATM in every town and city in the country.I believe Bitcoin will be the future of internet money, person-to-person instant transactions of any value for a penny, setup in under a minute,\u201d Hassan Khostaghaza, Managing Director of Satoshi Point told BTCFeed. Given the borderless nature of Bitcoin transfers \u2013 it\u2019s the same currency anywhere in the world and is not regulated by governments or financial institutions \u2013 transferring money to anyone else in the world takes mere minutes and comes with very low to non-existing fees. Not only is this a great way to counter the current money remittance model, but it also has another major benefit. Bitcoin is far more suitable for micropayments and microtransactions, compared to credit cards \u2013 which were never even intended to be used on the internet, and the lack of credit card security during online shopping shows you exactly that. On top of that, micropayments with credit cards are subject to ridiculously high fees, which is not financially viable for either the consumer nor the merchant. Regardless of how you look at it, Bitcoin is becoming more and more of a global force that can no longer be denied. However, there are still plenty of people who have never used Bitcoin or even been educated on it [in a proper manner]. Bitcoin ATM\u2019s make it more accessible to get involved with digital currency, but they are only the first step on a long way. The placement of Satoshi Point\u2019s Bitcoin ATM \u2013 on the ground floor below the TechHub Wales offices \u2013 could not be more aptly chosen. Over the next few months, up to 40 staff members of DVLA [Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency] will be working in the TechHub offices to mentor a number of software projects and start-up companies.

CJS CD Keys was the very first cd key retailer to do so, and by the end of 2014, Green Man Gaming had joined the fray as well. Earlier today, I found out that Gamesplanet is accepting Bitcoin payments through BitPay. Bitcoin remains a very \u201cniche\u201d market for the time being until we can find a way to educate properly on the technology behind this digital currency. While there is a lot of focus on the monetary aspect of Bitcoin \u2013 which is both good and bad \u2013 there is much more to it than just the value in USD, EUR, GBP or CNY. But In order to gain mainstream adoption, we also need to be able to present a lot of use cases for Bitcoin. Not necessarily to replace the current financial structure right now, but at least to show that Bitcoin is a viable alternative payment method for both consumers and retailers, and it is something both parties can benefit from. So I headed over to the Gamesplanet website earlier today,, to check out what kind of video games they had on sale for the time being. To my surprise, I saw a small banner on the right hand side saying the website now accepts Bitcoin payments. Needless to say, it was the best news I had heard all day. Even though I am not exactly a \u201chardcore gamer\u201d, I do enjoy dabbling around with video games on my PC once in a while. And now that we have more cd key retailers accepting Bitcoin, we could have a nice price war on our hands in the near future. More games for lower prices make me quite the happy bunny. Gamesplanet accepts bitcoin payment through its payment processor BitPay. As is usually the case with BitPay payments, they are confirmed instantly \u2013 I love zero-confirmation transactions \u2013 and my cd key was available in my account immediately. All I had to do was confirm my email address, as you will need to sign up for a Gamesplanet account before making a purchase. It is also great to see that Gamesplanet links to the official Bitcoin website, in order to inform their customers about this digital currency. It may not have a major impact right away, but given some time, these backlinks could prove to be invaluable in gaining mainstream adoption. When you think about it, you start to wonder whether we will see more cd key retailers accepting Bitcoin payments now that Changetip has integrated with Twitch.tv. It looks like the video game avenue is worth exploring by Bitcoin fanatics, as we could gain a strong foothold in that \u201cniche\u201d area over the next few months.

In Las Vegas, Nevada, the chances of finding a casino property that handles Bitcoin is growing larger every day. And now the Golden Gate Casino is openly advertising Bitcoin acceptance on the front of their building. Since January of 2014 \u2013 which is over a year ago, mind you \u2013 both of these casino properties started accepting Bitcoin payments at their physical location. In doing so, they became the very first casino properties to openly accept this disruptive digital currency, setting a precedent in not just the United States, but the entire world. Both the D Las Vegas Casino and the Golden Gate Hotel & Casino are co-owned properties, which is why they both started accepting Bitcoin payments at the same time. Whenever a customer checks in at the hotel\u2019s front desks, they are presented with the option to pay in Bitcoin. On top of that, the D\u2019s Gift Shop accepts payment in Bitcoin as well. But that is not all, as these casino properties come with influential connections to other interesting places where you can spend hard earned bitcoins. Both American Coney island \u2013 home of Detroit\u2019s legendary Coney Dogs \u2013 and Joe Vicari\u2019s Andiamo Italian Steakhouse accept Bitcoin payments as well, as long as you are a guest at the D Las Vegas Casino. Both casino properties are accepting Bitcoin payment through BitPay, the world\u2019s leading bitcoin payment processor to date. Because of BitPay\u2019s simple implementation of accepting Bitcoin payments \u2013 all it takes is a pre-configured tablet with a BitPay application \u2013 the choice was easy to make. \u201cI\u2019m proud that the D and Golden Gate will be the first casino properties to accept Bitcoin. We\u2019re located in the growing high-tech sector of downtown Las Vegas, and like all things downtown, we\u2019re quickly adaptive to new technology. The timing is right for us to launch this initiative, and I\u2019m happy to be able to offer this to our customers,\u201d said co-owner and CEO of the D and Golden Gate, Derek Stevens In January 2014. Just yesterday, I came across a post on Reddit which talks about the Golden Gate Hotel & Casino accepting Bitcoin, and how their neon sign clearly shows a Bitcoin logo. At this point, it\u2019s hard to image it took them over a year to publicly display the acceptance of Bitcoin, but it\u2019s nice to see it appear in real life regardless. According to some other reports on Reddit, one of the main issues remains finding staff members who know a thing or two about Bitcoin and whether or not their workplace accepts this payment method. Education on Bitcoin needs to be the focus of attention for Bitcoin enthusiasts around the world, as, without education, there will be no mass adoption.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/get-ready-for-international-bitcoin-day/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Get Ready For International Bitcoin Day!", "content": "In order to properly celebrate the joyous digital currency that is Bitcoin, it should get its holiday or at least a yearly \u201cday of Bitcoin\u201d. Apparently I am not the only one who has been thinking along those lines, as International Bitcoin Day is coming to a location near you in 2016. A day which is focused on the usage of Bitcoin, I like the concept so far. While Bitcoin is doing great in certain areas, it\u2019s still been looked at something \u201cillegal\u201d or \u201cdodgy\u201d by the majority of the world\u2019s population. For every piece of good news surrounding Bitcoin, there are at least as many or even more negative connotations to be made. The year 2015 has shown us exactly that once again, as it has been a turbulent first quarter, to say the least. The idea of International Bitcoin Day is pretty simple: get as many people to use Bitcoin for all of their expenses during one day of the year. How this will be achieved exactly remains to be seen, as there are a lot of people who don\u2019t [have access to] any bitcoins right now. But there is still plenty of time to turn that situation around, as International Bitcoin Day won\u2019t happen until January 3rd, 2016. One way of supporting this initiative is by spreading Bitcoin among your friends and family. By creating a handful of paper wallets \u2013 each loaded with a small amount of Bitcoin \u2013 you could set up a mini-chain reaction of Bitcoin expenses, assuming you can find a product everyone wants to spend those bits on that is. If we could somehow manage to create a unified goal of Bitcoin expenses for that day, that would bring more attention to International Bitcoin Day in my opinion. I\u2019m not saying we should all donate to charity on the same day, as that would be just a one-time deal. But how can we get more people to use Bitcoin for paying everyday things? Bitcoin debit cards could prove to be an interesting way of getting something done. As these cards are accepted in 170 [or slightly more] countries in the world, a few thousand of them pre-loaded with US$20 [or any other amount really] could set off the reaction we need. Especially because you can use them for everything you pay with a regular debit or credit card anyway. While that idea may not have a big impact on the merchants \u2013 as they will just see it as a regular debit card transaction \u2013 it does plant a seed in the mind of people that Bitcoin can be used to pay for anything and everything. How that payment is executed is quite easy to grasp, as it is a traditional payment method most people are already acquainted with to this day.

In order to build a viable economy, we need to create ways to spend more Bitcoins. But could you actually end up in jail for collecting too many Bitcoins? Apparently you can, if you live in Finland. Nearly every [European] country has its very own Pirate Party in terms of politics. And that is a good thing, as it just goes to show that, despite there not being all that many people were joining such a party, there is a legitimate demand for one to be in existence. After all, politics is all about free speech and getting things done, isn\u2019t it? Finland is no exception to this rule, as the Pirate Party Finland is one of the more successful ones to be found around the world. With over 3,600 members \u2013 since its inception in 2008, that is a staggering number \u2013 and its very own youth wing \u2013 Pirate Youth \u2013 this is one political party to keep an eye on in the years to come. In fact, the Pirate Party Finland has had some successes when it comes to elections as well. In 2011, during the Finnish parliamentary elections, the PPFI gathered 0.5% of the total votes cast, spread amongst 127 candidates in 11 constituencies. As a result, they became the largest party in Parliament without a seat. Things got even better during the 2014 European Parliament elections, during which the PPFI gathered 12,378 votes \u2013 0.7% of all total votes. More information on the Pirate Party Finland can be found here. Campaign funds are hard to come by, which is why the Pirate Party Finland decided to accept Bitcoin donations. According to Finnish law, you can collect up to 1,500 EUR per year in anonymous donations \u2013 which is not all that much when you consider it. However, Bitcoin donations are a bit of a \u201cgrey zone\u201d, as they are anonymous and not-anonymous at the same time. Furthermore, Finland does not recognize Bitcoin as a currency, which only makes it harder to define the term \u201cdonation\u201d. In fact, Finnish police officers have publicly stated \u201cthey have little idea of how Bitcoin donations should be handled\u201d. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you can get away with exceeding the annual 1,500 EUR donation cap though. According to Jonna Puroj\u00e4rvi, \u2013 press spokesperson for Pirate Party Finland \u2013 they have already surpassed the 1,500 EUR anonymous donation cap. As a result, the PPFI may become subject to a court case, which could very well set a precedent for the legality of Bitcoin donations in Finland. Ever since the PPFI started accepting Bitcoin donations, they have received over 47 BTC \u2013 worth roughly 11,500 EUR \u2013 to their address.Most of this funds was donated to a Finnish \u201cconservative party\u201d accused Pirate Party Finland of \u201creceiving illegal sponsorship\u201d.

But there is also good news to be noted, as exchanges such as QuadrigaCX and Cointrader are making a name for themselves. On top of that, Coinsquare.io has opened a CAD order book on their exchange platform. But that is not all, as Canadian customers will enjoy the services offered by Coinsquare.io as they can use INTERAC\u00ae funds transfers tog et their orders settled quickly. Furthermore, Coinsquare has removed all trading fees for a limited time \u2013 until May 1st, 2015 \u2013 in order to expand their customer base. \u201cWe want to provide Canadians access to bitcoin and other upcoming crypto-coin projects on our cutting-edge trading platform in a safe and user-friendly environment,\u201d says Virgile Rostand, Founder and Managing Director of Coinsquare. Top-notch security is a major point of focus for the Coinsquare team, as they have enabled time-based one-time passwords through Google Authenticator as a two-factor authentication method. But there are also email verifications and confirmations, as well as active IP monitoring of all users. Furthermore, Coinsquare runs an independent book reconciliation process, which is designed to detect any issues with any of the supported blockchains. This process will also prevent any unauthorized withdrawal of coins, as these types of transfers will be immediately flagged in the system. In regards to cold storage, Coinsquare keeps roughly 95% of all coins in a cold storage solution in order to mitigate any exploiting of the exchange. But there is more, as Coinsquare also protects customers\u2019 data with tooth and nail. All private data is being stored on private servers with full hard drive encryption and very strict authentication protocols when trying to access these servers. Public user data is distributed via high-performance cloud servers, in order to speed up the process and create a more streamlined user experience. The choice for INTERAC\u00ae payments was an easy decision, thanks to their partnership with Salt Technology Inc. \u201cThe Coinsquare team is providing a great service for traders, providing liquidity to multiple crypto-currency types, in a secure, simple interface. We\u2019re excited to be a part of their launch\u201d says Jim Brown, Vice-President Business Development at SALT. INTERAC\u00ae E-transfers will also be supported for those Coinsquare customers whose bank is not a member of the INTERAC\u00ae online program. However, this should not have an impact on the overall costs of the transaction, as both types of INTERAC\u00ae fund transfers result in the same fees for the customer. Coinsquare wants to create an easy-to-use and feature-rich environment for their customers. This environment will allow Canadian customers to trade CAD fiat currency and other digital currencies with ease. Some of the platform\u2019s unique features include time selectable charts, portfolio marking, and quick order entry. It is important to note that all Coinsquare trading markets are denominated in bits [1 million bits = 1 Bitcoin]. In order to help read quantities and prices in a more effective manner, the Coinsquare platform has integrated a unique decimal color coding. In total, there are eight different crypto-to-crypto trading markets to choose from [including Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin] and, of course, the BTC/CAD market.

BitWage is one of those unique, innovative companies who try to bridge the gap between receiving your monthly wage and having an easy way to access Bitcoins. Instead of waiting for your monthly wage to clear in your bank account, and then send a wire transfer to a Bitcoin exchange to buy digital currency, BitWage cuts out the middleman. Any BitWage user around the world can have his/her monthly wage \u2013 or at least a part of it, depending on your preference \u2013 converted to Bitcoin automatically. And the best part is, your employer will take care of all the hard work, and not even know a thing about the conversion to digital currency taking place. But what if you could get the Bitcoin part of your wage paid out directly to a debit card which can be used anywhere in the world? That would be the best of both worlds, wouldn\u2019t it? Or, to be more precise, a debit card that is not linked to any of your existing bank accounts. This is where Xapo comes into this story. There are multiple services in existence which let you order a debit card that can be funded with Bitcoin. Instead of spending actual Bitcoin when using said debit card, the service owners convert the BTC to fiat currency value on the fly. In the case of Xapo \u2013 a service currently still in beta \u2013 that conversion is done without any fees. However, if you load your card with a certain fiat currency \u2013 EUR/USD/GBP \u2013 and you need to convert that balance to another currency, there will be a 3% surcharge. While I like the idea of what Xapo offers in terms of their Bitcoin debit card, there are some things you need to take into consideration. First of all, if you live in the United States, they cannot send this card to you \u2013 even though it works fine within the US. Secondly, since this service is still in beta, you might need to wait a few months before receiving your card. Since BitWage and Xapo have agreed to a partnership, everyone who signs up for the BitWage service will receive a free debit card in the near future. This will enable contractors and employees to withdraw and spend fiat currency \u2013 USD/EUR/GBP \u2013 directly from the blockchain. Should you live outside the EU/US/UK, you can even be paid out in your local currency. This partnership between Xapo & BitWage will have a huge impact where international employee payments are concerned. Instead of paying a ridiculous fee to send funds overseas \u2013 and the recipient having to wait up to 7-10 business days for funds to clear \u2013 operational efficiency will be increased by using the Bitwage service and their debit cards for your employees. Benefits for the employer come in the form of using one single and simple payroll service to pay all of your employees, regardless of their location. On top of that, you can pay your employees a slightly higher wage as the associated fees with sending money overseas are minimal. In the end, this is a win-win situation for all parties involved. As an employee, you will greatly benefit from this service as well. Instead of experiencing delays, issues, and a lower wage because of the current financial infrastructure and its silly fees, you can leverage the potential of the Bitwage International Debit Card to your advantage. And the best part is that your employer doesn\u2019t even need to sign up to use this service. But it would be a good idea if they explored the option at least, for future reference. In order to make use of the BitWage International Debit Card, there are a few steps you need to take. First of all, you need to sign up for a BitWage account Once your details have been confirmed and you are logged in, click \u201c\u201dXapo Card History\u201d in the top right corner of your screen. You will be asked to either create a new Xapo account or authorize BitWage to link to your existing account. After everything is linked, you have applied for this card automatically, and it will take roughly one week before your card has been approved. All that is left is setting up an Employer in your BitWage account.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/growing-interest-in-bitcoin-functionality-for-existing-atms/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Growing Interest in Bitcoin Functionality for Existing ATMs", "content": "Most people automatically assumed that creating Bitcoin ATM\u2019s would increase awareness and adoption of our disruptive digital currency. Even though there are a few hundred Bitcoin ATM\u2019s deployed all over the world, it doesn\u2019t seem to impact adoption at all. But do people actually like \u2013 or really dislike \u2013 digital currency ATM\u2019s? Let\u2019s find out. According to a recent survey published by ATM Marketplace \u2013 called \u201cATM Future Trends 2015\u201d \u2013 over 10% of the interviewees want to see virtual currency exchange capabilities added to existing ATMs. Whether or not that number surprises you is irrelevant, as it shows that over one in ten people want to dabble around with Bitcoin and other currencies. You may be wondering which demographic is most keen on seeing support for virtual currency exchanging on existing ATM\u2019s. The answer should not be a surprise to you either, as it is the younger demographic. These are the people who grew up in a world full of technology and who are among the first to keep pace with the rate at which technology evolves. Granted, there is a growing interest for Bitcoin support on existing ATM\u2019s. However, eleven percent doesn\u2019t necessarily warrant the investment \u2013 in terms of time, effort and money \u2013 to explore the option of adding digital currency functionalities. According to the ATM Marketplace report, we might be having a different conversation in 2018. And that also begs the question: \u201cDo people want to see virtual currency functionalities added to existing ATM\u2019s because it is the current hip trend?\u201d People have very short attention spans these days, and most of the consumers hop from one \u201chot thing\u201d to the next without giving it a second though. Is digital currency the current \u201chot thing\u201d, and if so, will it stay that way for years to come? Regardless of the percentages to be found in the study conducted by ATM Marketplace, Bitcoin, and other digital currencies will not replace cash [anytime soon]. In fact, most people want to improve the existing cash functionalities associated with using an ATM, such as being able to withdraw funds in multiple denominations. Many countries around the world still deal in checks, especially when it comes to paying bills or receiving your wage. However, in countries such as Belgium, the usage of checks has been abandoned many years ago. Granted, there is still a form of \u201cbank check\u201d we use over here, but anything other than that is done either by cash or wire transfer. In the United States and Canada, however, a lot of payments are still being done via checks. And that also shows in the ATM Marketplace study, as over 40% of interviewees want to add a \u201ccheck cashing\u201d functionality to existing ATM\u2019s. This just goes to show you that studies like this can be taken out of context easily, as the results in Europe would be far different in that area. One of the things I like about this ATM Marketplace study is the fact they also asked the same question to the ATM providers. Surprisingly, 19% of the interviewees want to see virtual currency exchange capabilities implemented in the near future. Despite that higher percentile, it was still the least favorite choice, unfortunately. A lot of ATM providers want to give people the option to pay their bills while using an ATM \u2013 which will undoubtedly cause quite a waiting queue. However, they also see eye-to-eye with the consumers in regards to withdrawing cash in multiple denominations, which is one of the features more likely to be implemented over the next few years.

Unfortunately for Bitcoin enthusiasts all around the world, our beloved digital currency will always be associated with major scandals, such as Mt. Gox. On top of that, there is so much negative focus on Bitcoin from mainstream media regarding its price, making it even harder to gain worldwide adoption. But do we really need a rebrand? Most of you will have heard of the Bitcoin Foundation by now, but for those of you who haven\u2019t, allow me to explain. Many people have an issue with the current shape of the Bitcoin Foundation, as many people feel its members are not doing nearly enough to promote Bitcoin itself, but rather focus on their individual companies and organizations. It looks like the new main goal of the Bitcoin Foundation is to dilute the Bitcoin brand. This is a very strange idea, especially when you consider that the Foundation claims to \u201chave Bitcoin\u2019s best interest at heart\u201d. So they have come up with a new idea to brand cryptocurrency altogether. In saying so, Chantel Meeley \u2013 Vogogo\u2019s Head of Marketing and Creative \u2013 wants to unite Bitcoin and every altcoin in existence under one brand. According to Chantel, this will prove to very beneficial to mainstream adoption of digital currency in general. As a result of this brainstorm, Vogogo has teamed up with Crypts \u2013 the exchange platform most of us dislike but end up using anyway \u2013 to create a competition for BrandMeCrypto. The winner of this competition \u2013 you have to design a proper logo \u2013 will win US$10,000, even though it remains to be seen how that amount will be paid out exactly. If you pay close attention to the BrandMeCrypto website, you will see several issues with this idea. First of all, the team assumes there are over 650 different digital currencies in existence today. Needless to say, that number is far higher. Most of these coins are either dead or become useless. Not to mention how little innovation is offered by most coins. Don\u2019t get me wrong, a United brand for cryptocurrency could be a good thing, in the long run. But why should that brand be anything other than Bitcoin at this point in time? Bitcoin is the most valuable cryptocurrency of all, and any altcoin gains or loses value compared to Bitcoin\u2019s current price. If your altcoin is so strong, it can be a brand of its own without a problem, right? Despite its recent elections, it looks like the Bitcoin Foundation is still on the wrong path of filling their own pockets instead of putting blockchain technology into the hands of as many people as they possible can. Whether or not the BrandMeCrypto initiative will have any success remains to be seen, but we can only wait and see what happens\u2026 Source: https://archive.today/wj3AX", "date": "2015-03-26T10:54:03+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 26}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitbingo-where-bingo-meets-bitcoin/", "author": "Zane Huffman", "title": "BitBingo, Where Bingo Meets Bitcoin", "content": "The bitcoin gambling industry is rapidly increasing. It has grown from primarily dicing and slots to incorporate a wide variety of gambling games and niches over the years. Bingo, however, was a popular game that had yet to be implemented into the bitcoin world. There was not a single online bitcoin bingo operation until just last week, when BitBingo released. BitBingo is one of the newest bitcoin gambling companies, running since just March 18th of this year. The site, which has attracted players for its uniqueness to other gambling sites, is expanding their player base with daily guaranteed bingo games, cashback bonuses, and progressive jackpots. Although young, the site believes they can eventually become one of the most popular bitcoin gambling options out there. BitBingo currently features 11 multiplayer bingo rooms. Through these rooms, players can choose to participate in either 75 ball or 90 ball across two different themes, competing to complete different patterns at different rates. Currently, the most popular bingo room on the site is \u201cGold Rush 75 ball Patterns 1\u201d. This style of play incorporates 5\u00d75 bingo cards, where all participants race to complete the specified pattern before their competition. The first player to complete their pattern wins 80% of the pot, any runner ups split the final 20%. Gold rush is the theme of the room, and the price of a card is 1 mBTC. Two of the eleven rooms are the promotional guaranteed rooms. The first room, which plays once every four hours, offers a guaranteed pot of 50 mBTC, with only a .5 mBTC cost per card. What this means for the player is the company is chipping in free bitcoin as long as there are under 100 participants. The second room plays once a day, and the guaranteed pot is 250 mBTC. The price per bingo card is 2.5 mBTC, which once again means free bitcoin as long as there are under 100 participants. Both of these rooms are 90 ball. Another popular feature on the site is the progressive jackpot offered at each bingo room. The progressive jackpot is a huge bonus prize awarded to any player who completes their card before a certain amount of balls are called. In 90 ball rooms, any player who fills their card on or before the 52nd ball wins the prize. For 75 ball blackout games, its on or before the 54th. In 75 ball pattern games, the number is dependent on the complexity and difficulty of the pattern. The jackpot bonus builds with card sales, and resets to the base value once claimed by a player. The site is also offering a cashback bonus equal to 500% of any player\u2019s first deposit. 50% of site profits earned from a player will be redistributed back to the player. Players will earn their cashback daily based on the previous day\u2019s profits, and will continue to earn this bonus until they have been paid back 500% of their first deposit. This bonus has a maximum payout of 5 bitcoin, meaning all deposits of 1 bitcoin or less are fully eligible. The site has already overcome obstacles in its short life. On the launch, a player exploited a bug in the site to earn a 1.5 bitcoin jackpot. The bug, however, was at the fault of the website, so they elected to pay the player in full. This sentiment goes a long way to prove the legitimacy and professionality of the website. Bitbingo is quickly growing, and their exciting and suspenseful bingo rooms hold great potential. The guaranteed and cashback bonuses may not be permanent, so if you enjoy playing bingo, now is the time to set up an account and start playing.

Comic books would be a good way to do that, as we have seen in the form of the Bitcoin Comic. And by the looks of it, more and more comic book-related services are starting to accept digital currency payments as well. Most of our readers have probably not heard of Titanium Comics before, so allow us to explain what they do exactly. Titanium Comics is a comic book publisher, and are known for releasing the \u201cAge of Darkness\u201d, \u201cThe Arcane\u201d \u201cDeath Raye\u201d and \u201cThe Fraternity\u201d comic book series, all of which were made available in 2014. Titanium Comics has been around since 2010, and the company was born from the idea of that was years in the making. Even though some of our readers may feel that the comic book scene is oversaturated already, Titanium Comics saw a gap that needed to be filled. And so they did, by creating stories and using multiple technologies to achieve that goal. As a result, comic book fans around the world have been treated to some of the most unique characters you will ever encounter. On top of that, Titanium Comics prides itself on coming up with unique story ideas thanks to their team of talented writers. Blended with some of the comic book world\u2019s top artists, and you can see why this became a recipe for success. Titanium Comics is the comic book arm of Titanium Publishing, LLC. Titanium Comics has decided to take a very bold step in order to expand their global presence. By partnering with Bitcoin payment processor BitPay, comic book fans from around the world can now pay for their orders in Bitcoin, on both the Titanium Comics website and their Facebook store. The best part about this announcement comes in the form of customers not only being able to purchase comics, but also any merchandise sold by Titanium Comics and pay their order in Bitcoin. In doing so, Titanium Comics has become one of world\u2019s first comic book publishers to accept Bitcoin transactions for their services and products. Business Manager Dion Wilson comments, \u201cOur fourth quarter releases had to be a bit delayed, but considering the growth potential we gained in the delay we are ok with it! Cryptocurrencies allow anyone anywhere quite literally to gain access to our line, and we are excited to see the results.\u201d For fans of Titanium Comics\u2019 \u201cThe Arcane\u201d series, there is some good news to report. \u201cThe Arcane #2: Homecoming Part 2\u201d is the next release on the calendar and will be available in-store as of June 2015. It is interesting to note that \u201cThe Arcane #2\u201d is written by J. Dominguez, whereas \u201cThe Arcane #1\u201d was written by Andy Wolfendon. But for the fans of the artwork to be found in \u201cThe Arcane #1\u201d, have no fear, as Paolo D\u2019Antonio is responsible for penciling and inking \u201cThe Arcane #2\u201d as well. Short Description of \u201cThe Arcane #2\u201d : Phelan and the Books are now in the hands of the Demon Riders. Quinn is devastated. The Brothers realize they must get the boy back-not only out of love, but because his powers are growing daily, and Lucifer\u2019s minions will turn him into a servant of darkness. The Arcane Brothers have now got a fight on their hands they never wanted, but definitely aren\u2019t prepared for.

Speaking of quick, One Hour Essays is a new online service which started accepting Bitcoin since yesterday. Let\u2019s take a look at what they have to offer, shall we? The term \u201cessay\u201d can be used quite loosely here, as the service claims to cater towards both high school and university students. Needless to say, when I was in high school, it was relatively easy to complete an essay on any topic within the hour. Especially when the Internet started playing a bigger role in our lives. During my brief stint at university, however, it became clear that the essays those professors expect you to write can not be completed that easily. Some of them will even take several months in order to finish. Not to mention how they expect it to be a certain amount of pages, words and whatnot. One Hour Essays can write your essay up to 1,000 words for the price of US$100. It doesn\u2019t even matter which topic it should be about, as they can cover pretty much anything you need. In fact, they even go as far as offering their customers a guaranteed B+ or else you get a 25% discount on the essay price. The One Hour Essays website looks pretty bad, to be blunt. Anyone with a bit of HTML skills or even a WYSIWYG editor with very little functionality \u2013 can create something that looks far more professional. A white background, some black text and a crooked clock at the bottom is all you will need to be convinced apparently. One Hour Essays guarantees customers the work will be completed within one hour of receiving the payment \u2013 in Bitcoin or via Paypal. The team consists of multiple [read: eight] professional writers, who are instantly notified whenever a new job has been accepted. Whoever jumps on the task first will be given one hour to send the finalized version to the customer. In order to make a purchase from One Hour Essays, you need to send them an email with all of the relevant info, such as your details, the topic you need covered, additional specifications, et cetera. Once the job has been accepted, you should receive your essay the following hour, delivered directly to your mailbox. It is great to see new services opening up in order to work with the Bitcoin payment model. However, if you are in university, this service may not be the best for you, as they expect a certain quality and standard. For high school students, this might just be what you are looking for.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/when-does-bitcoin-become-money/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "When Does Bitcoin Become Money?", "content": "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts already see Bitcoin as just another form of money. And this is partially true, as you can use Bitcoin to pay for goods and services, both online and offline. However, the mainstream masses seem to associate Bitcoin with a \u201ccurrency\u201d at best, and \u201cfake internet money\u201d in the worst case scenario. But when will Bitcoin actually become money? Before any currency \u2013 online or offline \u2013 can become money, it will have to go through several stages. The first step is gaining a store of value, and more importantly, proving that your payment method is capable of being that store of value over the course of 3-5 years. Considering how Bitcoin\u2019s first use cases have all been about \u201cstore of value\u201d, we can safely conclude that this step has been completed successfully. But how does Bitcoin gain that store of value if it\u2019s still a \u201cniche\u201d payment method? Needless to say, this is a topic of heavy debate, as it all depends on how you classify Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin greatly appeals to investors and day traders, simply because of its sheer liquidity [due to the lack of mass-adoption] and its volatile price swings \u2013 as we can see on the charts right now. Investing in Bitcoin itself does not give it its \u201cstore of value\u201d aspect. However, using a separate wallet to store your bitcoins for a later date, and not spending them on a regular basis, does indicate you are storing Bitcoins for their value. That is, in the hopes of the Bitcoin value going up, just like you would store precious metals, stocks and other valuable assets. When we want more people to think of Bitcoin as money \u2013 in terms of a payment system that is \u2013 we need to convince them to actively hold this digital currency. After all, where would the credit card networks be if no one used a Visa or Mastercard today? They would fall flat on their ass, and that could very well happen to Bitcoin as well. As the number of people actively holding Bitcoin grows, the logical result is that Bitcoin becomes a medium of exchange. Not in the sense of exchanging Bitcoin to fiat currency per se, but also as a way to buy and sell goods and services on a bigger scale. We are currently in this stage, and as the number of Bitcoin user grows, this phase will be completed successfully over time. Last but not least, goods and services need to be priced in Bitcoin in 5-8 years from now. Most retailers that are accepting Bitcoin payments still list their items in fiat currency and accept the Bitcoin equivalent as payment. But what if products and services were to be listed in a Bitcoin value, regardless of the fiat currency value that would represent at any given time? Another downside to pricing goods and services in fiat currency [even though you can pay the same amount in Bitcoin] is the fact that people will automatically revert to using traditional payment methods. There is a mental association between payment methods such as banks wires, credit cards and debit cards, and paying for anything billed in fiat currency. It has to be said however that the current volatile Bitcoin price is not doing the digital currency any favors in order to be used as a unit of account in the near future. On the other hand, volatile swings have been occurring less frequent over the past year and a half, which could be an indication of a price stabilisation process.

Mainstream adoption of Bitcoin is still far away, but with popular mobile Bitcoin wallets, that future is coming closer every day. Just a few days ago, Zebpay held a launch event, called \u201cThe Future of Money\u201d. It will come as no surprise to you that people living in the Western world are not the right target audience for Bitcoin\u2019s core values. Most of us already have [easy] access to funds, bank accounts and credit cards, while there is a large portion of the world that remains unbanked. It is these people who will benefit most from what Bitcoin can do for them. Zebpay demonstrated that, as their launch event in India was attended by over 400 people. India is one of the world\u2019s poorest nations, with a few areas that are an exception. For example, poverty rates in Himachal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh are far lower compared to areas such as Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. In order to create a more stable economy in India, Bitcoins could prove to be a great asset. In fact, one of India\u2019s leading law firms \u2013 called Nishith Desai Associates \u2013 recently published their whitepaper on Indian Legal & Tax Considerations for Bitcoin. This just goes to show that there are many \u201chigher up\u201d people who feel that Bitcoin and digital currencies could be beneficial to their country. All of India\u2019s Bitcoin-related companies will be uniting under the banner of \u201cBitcoin India Alliance\u201d. Their main objective will be to educate people on Bitcoin in order to raise awareness and adoption of this disruptive digital currency. Several Bitcoin experts will form an independent body to successfully complete this mission. But that is not all, as the Bitcoin India Alliance will represent the Bitcoin industry in India to the country\u2019s government officials and other associations. In doing so, some of the more \u201cgrey area\u201d details about Bitcoin in India can be cleared up, and the digital currency can start gaining a legitimate foothold in one of the countries where it could be most beneficial to the inhabitants. Last but not least, mobile Bitcoin wallet provider Zebpay announced some new features which will be released very soon. On top of that, the company will also focus on making Bitcoins more usable inside the client itself, instead of just offering a mobile platform to easily buy and sell Bitcoin. Bitcoin usage in India could use a boost, and Zebpay will aim to achieve that goal by offering Amazon India and Flipkart vouchers at a 10% discount to their users. Furthermore, a business directory including India\u2019s first merchants to accept Bitcoin payments will be made available in one of the future wallet updates.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-exchange-cryptoine-hacked-due-to-trading-engine-bug/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Bitcoin Exchange Cryptoine Hacked Due To Trading Engine Bug", "content": "The stressful times for Bitcoin exchanges around the world will not come to an end anytime soon, as we learned earlier today that the Cryptoine platform has been hacked. Not too many details have been made available at this point in time, but we will recap the information we managed to obtain so far. The Cryptoine exchange lets users trade Bitcoin against various other digital currencies, and does not handle any fiat currency transactions. Similar to most cryptocurrency exchanges, the trading of coins intermittently is a solid business model which does not [yet?] require the owner(s) to obtain a specific money transmitting license. Cryptoine was originally announced to the public in July of 2014, and came forth from a group of digital currency enthusiasts who were not satisfied with the cryptocurrency exchanges at that given time. All of them felt confident they could do a far better job, so they decided to create their \u201cnext generation platform\u201d. One of the key areas of running a successful [digital currency] exchange is offering top notch security. The Cryptoine team focused on that area from the beginning, by running a passive wallet, which was not accessible through the trading engine. Furthermore, the website\u2019s front end could not connect to the wallet either, nor was there information to be found regarding the Bitcoin wallets\u2019 private keys. Most people who use a digital currency exchange are rather hesitant to create a user account there. As we all know by now, user accounts are a perfect target for hackers and hoodlums. Cryptoine acknowledged that desire and ran their exchange service without collecting any personal data from its users, nor asking them to verify their account at any time. To offer even more layers of security, the Cryptoine team created daily balance reports for all of their users, all of which are verified by humans. By strictly calculating the user balances at the end of every day, the team could keep an eye on how things were going, and quickly detect any malicious attempts of cheating the system in any way. Despite all of these \u2013 and other \u2013 security precautions, you still run the risk of discovering a bug once the damage has been done. Unfortunately for the Cryptoine team, this is exactly what happened overnight. According to the message posted on the website\u2019s main page, a hacker managed to exploit a race condition bug in the trading engine. Because of this race condition exploit, the hacker [apparently, it was one individual as far as we know] managed to manipulate several of the exchange\u2019s orders and create a fake balance for himself/herself. It remains unclear whether or not this hacker managed to withdraw any of the funds, as the Cryptoine team has not revealed those details yet.

Regardless of whether their business model is focusing on the online or offline space, business owners can greatly benefit from digital currency payments. But what is the driving factor for business to accept Bitcoin? One of the key elements in getting more business to accept Bitcoin payments starts with proper education about this disruptive digital currency. And not just in regards to the technological advantages, as these types of conversations usually lead to people understanding even less than before they started talking to you. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Bitcoin offers a technology revolution in its own right, but it is simply too far ahead of its time. People have only recently gotten used to the idea of using bank-issued cards, credit cards and debit cards in order to pay for their purchases/ And online shopping is an area that is still growing year over year, despite huge amounts of sales registering during the holiday periods. On the other hand, the latest economical crisis \u2013 which is still going on, despite what economists might be trying to tell you \u2013 has opened the door for an entirely new financial structure to gain a foothold. Bitcoin came along at the most opportune time, and despite it\u2019s six years of existence, most people still can\u2019t explain what it is exactly. When you get asked to explain Bitcoin, there is no one definitive answer or explanation that checks all the boxes. You have to keep in mind who you are talking to, and what kind of background they have. And more importantly, which aspect of Bitcoin are they interested in the technology or the monetary aspect? As long as we can\u2019t properly educate people on Bitcoin \u2013 an issue a lot of us have been trying to tackle for years now \u2013 we will never see mainstream adoption. However, efforts are being made in order to provide novice users with relevant information on the aspect of Bitcoin they are most interested in. The technology side isn\u2019t relevant for most people just yet, but it will be in a few years from now. For a business owner, the story is relatively simple. They want to expand their customer base and spend as little money as possible while doing so. Bitcoin checks all boxes in that regard, as it is a global payment method with nearly no set-up costs and incredibly low transaction fees associated with the transfer of money between users. But there is an asterisk to be made here. If your business relies on a lot of small amount-based transactions per day, Bitcoin is a perfect solution for you. Instead of working with cash payments or credit cards, Bitcoin payments can be done nearly instantaneously at very low to zero extra costs. However, if you are a car salesman, for example, Bitcoin may not be the right fit for you just yet. Granted, you can reduce the transaction fees to a bare minimum as well. But converting Bitcoin into thousands of dollars of cash on an irregular basis may not be worth the [tiny] amount of hassle that is a part of accepting Bitcoin payments.

Just like any other asset, currency or value that can be charted, Bitcoin is going through a period of cycles during which it hits a low before prices start trending upwards again. Bitcoin prices go through a cycle the lasts- on average- between 12 weeks and 14.5 weeks. Every cycle shows a similar patterns, during which we go from one low to another low 12-14 weeks later, before prices start picking up again.. What may the most intriguing part of this Bitcoin price cycle is the fact that the first and last low do not necessarily correlate. If you take a look at the Bitcoin price chart of April 2013 until today, you will see the pattern I\u2019m talking about. Between April 1st, 2013 and July 1st, 2013, the Bitcoin price went from one low to another, despite two small uptrends in early April and the end of May. But eventually, once 84 days [or 12 weeks] had passed, we found ourselves at another new low before the next uptrend began. That same pattern repeated itself from July 1st, 2013 until September 30th, 2013, during which it took 91 days [13 weeks] to go from one low to the next low. There was a nice uptrend between the end of July and the beginning of September, after which the charts flattened again, settling at a new low on September 30th. These cycles have been repeating themselves between September 30th and December 16th of 2013 [77 days or 11 weeks]; December 16th 2013 & February 26th 2014 [70 days or 10 weeks] and February 26th & April 7th [42 days or 6 weeks \u2013 an unusual short duration]. As you would come to expect, a short duration between lows would be followed by an extended period before the cycle started again. And that period lasted from April 7th, 2014 until September 29th, 2014 [175 days or 25 weeks]. On September 29th, the most recently completed cycle began, which lasted until January 12th, 2015 [105 days or 15 weeks]. Fast forward until today \u2013 10 weeks since the previous Bitcoin price low \u2013 and you can start guesstimating what the Bitcoin price will do over the next few weeks. Assuming this cycle will keep repeating itself, it looks like the Bitcoin price [in USD$ is poised to reach a new height [as high as US$400] before sliding downwards again to set the cycle\u2019s endpoint low price. How low this new endpoint low will be is hard to predict, but we may very well be looking at a US$325-US$340 mark when this cycle ends.", "date": "2015-03-23T13:35:52+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 23}

While a new mobile game is nothing new under the sun these days, SaruTobi distinguishes itself by letting users earn Bitcoin in-game for playing well and improving their scores. Bitcoin cloud mining service provider Genesis Mining has taken a liking to this game as well, and the company is now officially sponsoring the SaruTobi application. Despite being only six weeks old, the SaruTobi application has been downloaded and installed by more than 7,000 users so far. The application has been designed to spread awareness about Bitcoin, by letting players earn the digital currency in-game as they collect power-ups and Bitcoin tokens with the in-game character. Many people have been wondering where SaruTobi\u2019s revenue stream is coming from, considering they are literally \u201cgiving away money\u201d to players. Although the task sounds a lot easier than it is, the game developers are not handing out hundreds of thousands of dollars to players on a monthly basis either. You will have to play quite a lot of hours in order to earn just one US dollar. By allowing for in-store purchases, sponsors and donations, the SaruTobi game developers can afford to give away a portion of their profits to the people playing their game. As more and more people learn about the game itself, plus the fact that you can get a small chunk of a Bitcoin by actively playing, Bitcoin awareness could reach new heights. Genesis Mining comes into the picture as they have become one of SaruTobi\u2019s sponsors. As a result of this sponsorship, Genesis Mining has given 15,000 GH/s / 15TH/s) of Bitcoin cloud mining power to SaruTobi. All of the earnings from this hashpower will be put into a Bitcoin pot, from which the revenue is shared with the SaruTobi players. Bitcoin awareness will greatly benefit from the fun, free and easy to understand initiatives, such as comic books and video games. After all, the younger generation has a far better chance of grasping the Bitcoin ideology and technology at their current age, compared to convincing members of two or more generations ago.

Both January and February were months in which major Bitcoin exchange platforms have been hacked, and funds have been stolen. More recently, Coinapult got hacked and lost 150 Bitcoins. But Sweden-based Bitcoin exchange Safello is bringing some positive news to the table, which is more than welcome at this point in time. Over the past few years, crowdfunding has become a new trend in the world of business and finance. Instead of relying on one or two major investors to get your company or concept off the ground, you can ask any everyday person to back your project. As a result, we have seen many successful platforms emerge, such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and Patreon. FundedByMe is a Swedish crowdfunding platform, which has seen great success ever since its inception in March of 2011. Unlike its US-centered counterparts in Kickstarter and Indiegogo, FundedByMe wanted to provide a crowdfunding platform for European entrepreneurs and everyday investors. In order to do so, the company offers reward-based, loan-based and equity crowdfunding to its users. By offering a wide variety of crowdfunding options, FundedByMe sets itself apart from the more traditional models while still catering to the crowd of \u201creward seekers\u201d. In exchange for a successful campaign on FundedByMe, the company charges a 6% fee on the total amount of funds raised for reward-based campaigns. Equity campaigns are subject to a 500 EUR fee + 8% of the amount raised; whereas loan-based campaigns are subject to a 4% fee on the total amount plus a 1% administrative fee on repayments. Now that FundedByMe also allows digital currency holders to participate in these crowdfunding campaigns, the company is hoping to expand its business portfolio and customer base on a much bigger scale. It has to be said however that this is just a pilot test, and Bitcoin pledges can only be made towards one of the platform\u2019s crowdfunding campaigns. Safello\u2019s campaign is the very first of its kind to be held on a major crowdfunding platform. Over the course of the 45-day campaign, Safello hopes to raise 472,634 EUR in order to take their business to the next level. Most of the funds will be used to expand the Safello team and offering outside of Sweden to provide an even better service to European customers. In order to attract more customers to the Safello Bitcoin exchange, a portion of the raised funds will be used to add more payment methods and bank connections to this platform. If everything goes according to plan, Safello will establish a leading position in Europe as a stepping stone towards global expansion. But that is not all, as you will also get something in return for investing in Safello. No less than 5.19% of the company\u2019s shares are offered in this crowdfunding campaign, which each share valued at 154.30 EUR. When we take a look at the actual share valuation, we see a price of 9,092,842 EUR, which leaves much room to make a profit, besides investing in an upcoming Swedish company of course. The minimum investment for Safello\u2019s FundedByMe campaign is 1,080.13 EUR, which will reward you with 7 company shares (~0.0119% of the company).

Or maybe you have participated in a LocalBitcoins trade and you notice that the price agreed upon is lower than the current Bitcoin price? But what if there was an option to get 10% extra from the market value? The way Bitcoin exchanges usually operate goes like this: they take the current Bitcoin price into account and offer to buy your Bitcoins at 5-10% under the current price. This difference between the exchange\u2019s price and the actual exchange rate varies depending on how fast you want to receive your fiat currency. There will always be a trade-off between profitability and convenience. My Wallet Ltd. is a brand new Bitcoin exchange platform, which is more than happy to purchase your Bitcoins at a price higher than the current market value. In fact, they will even pay you up to 10% more than the current exchange rate, just so they can expand their customer base, and you can earn the money per Bitcoin you feel comfortable with. Do keep in mind that this offer will not remain valid for all time, as it is a special promotional offer running from March 15th, 2015 until May 23rd, 2015. And for those of you who aware wondering which exchange rate My Wallet Ltd. is using, they take the Bitstamp exchange rate into account and add 10% on top of that for the time being. But there is more! If you can provide My wallet Ltd. with a lot of liquidity \u2013 in excess of 50 Bitcoin per sale that is \u2013 you will qualify for special privileges. At this point, it remains a bit unclear as to what these special privileges are exactly. We will try to find out more details and update this article accordingly. Needless to say, the service offered by My Wallet Ltd. sounds very fishy and does not even seem like a lucrative business model. According to the company\u2019s press release, the goal is to close as many Bitcoin deals as possible, even if that means shelling out extra cash to keep their customers happy. One of the things that looks very suspicious is the fact that My Wallet Ltd. will pay for any fees associated with turning your Bitcoin into fiat currency. Customers have the option of receiving their money through Wire Transfer, Paypal, Western Union or MoneyGram. In all of those cases, any additional fees will be paid by My Wallet Ltd. According to the press release, My Wallet Ltd. has conducted Bitcoin transactions worth up to 2.3 million GBP, despite any lack of information as to who is behind the company and where they are operating from. More importantly, why is their domain name expiring the day after this \u201ccrazy promotional deal\u201d ends? The deal runs until May 23rd, and the domain expires May 24th. Seems a bit suspicious, no? Granted, you could still label this is a mere coincidence. But what about the domain registrar information, which is protected by Perfect Privacy LLC.? If this were a legitimate company, surely we would be able to find out some information about them this way? Everything about this platform screams \u201cblatant scam\u201d if you ask me.

QuadrigaCX is one of the contenders, and it looks like CoinTrader could prove to be very stiff competition. In order to become a proper Bitcoin exchange that is complying with all regulatory requirements, you need to bring quite a lot of money to the table. The money transmitter license alone will cost you a few hundred thousand CAD, and that is just one of the many compliance requirements that need to be in order. Furthermore, a Bitcoin exchange also needs to have top notch security \u2013 which costs a lot of money, as security experts are not cheap \u2013 and a well-trained staff to handle any request or complaint. Last but not least, there is the topic of being able to provide enough liquidity on both the Bitcoin and fiat currency side of the scale. Newnote Financial Corp. has recently acquired Cointrader.net, a Canadian-based Bitcoin exchange, for the sum of CAD$ 1.18 million \u2013 both in cash and stock. Some of you may know the name Newnote Financial Corp, as it was formerly known as Wimrock Resources. The company is best known for its ventures in the world of cryptocurrency. Newnote Financial Corp. is a publicly traded company on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE), which can be compared to the OTC markets in the United States. By acquiring the Cointrader.net Bitcoin exchange, there is a ver real possibility of the exchange going live on the CSE in the near future. Note from the Author: Newnote Financial Corp is currently trading at a price of CAD$0.19 per share, with the company\u2019s total valuation at CAD$5.77 million. Canadian Bitcoin exchange CoinTrader has seen a healthy growth over the past few months. Part of this growth can be attributed to other popular exchanges shutting down, such as the previously mentioned CaVirtex. But let\u2019s not forget that CoinTrader added a CAD order book to their platform earlier this year. Furthermore, CoinTrader had also inked a strategic partnership with payment processor Vogogo, which will help the company expand their operations to the US and Europe. It will be interesting to see which role Newnote Financial Corp. will play in these expansion plans, as the company had been working on its very own trading platform before acquiring CoinTrader.

However, Amazon has clearly stated they will not implement Bitcoin payments anytime soon. So how can we use Bitcoin to pay for Amazon orders? Coinjay might be the Chrome plugin you have been waiting for. Coinjay is an extension for the popular Chrome browser and can be downloaded free of charge from the Chrome Store. And it works as advertised, whenever you are ready to pay for an Amazon purchase, a \u201cPay With Bitcoin\u201d button will appear below the regular \u201cPlace Order\u201d button. Once you click this \u201cPay with Bitcoin\u201d button, you are redirected to a Coinjay checkout page which is hosted by CoinBase. The checkout page will include the item you are looking to purchase, as well as the total price including shipping costs. From what we can gather by looking at the provided screenshots, Coinjay charges a US$5 fee per transaction. Note from the Author: The exact fee could not be confirmed at this time, due to lacking information on the Coinjay website. Other than that, this CoinJay Chrome extension seems to be working exactly as advertised, even though there is a small twist. As long as you are using the US Amazon site (Amazon.com) , the \u201cPay with Bitcoin\u201d button will appear. However, if you are using an international site, such as Amazon.it or Amazon.fr, that button will not be visible. That might strike you as odd, considering how CoinBase has expanded their service across multiple European countries, including France and Italy. So there technically shouldn\u2019t be any reason for not supporting international Amazon websites, unless the developers deliberately coded the Chrome extension to behave like this \u2013 which would be quite disappointing. As much as I like the idea of using a Chrome extension to let me pay for Amazon orders in Bitcoin, Coinjay is not striking me as the best option to do so. In fact, their entire website \u2013 with beautiful colors \u2013 lacks a lot of information, such as who is behind this plugin, why they are offering it, which fees they charge exactly, et cetera. Granted, in the footer area of the website, we see a few names mentioned. Apparently, Coinjay is a product created by Baylaunch, a company you will find zero information about on the Internet. Richard Gong and Mike H. Lee are the creators of this plugin, but that\u2019s as far as the information goes. Not exactly a good way to build a trustworthy relationship with potential customers, is it?

Well, a Bitcoin market known by the name of CryptoThrift has changed this by allowing thousands of people to go ahead and trade whatever they want on the Internet while buying and selling things with the help of their cryptocurrencies. An interesting development has just happened and sources point out that all of those who have used the service until now are in for surprise, as the marketplace is hard at work introducing a couple of more features. Since it has been launched over in 2013, CryptoThrift has served more than 26,000 users, while not having any major update, which is why the system needs an overhaul at this moment in time, in an effort to ensure that other marketplaces don\u2019t get close enough to be considered as competition, but also to make sure that people who hold cryptocurrencies find it easy to trade their objects. With these factors in mind, the marketplace has now introduced a one-click to relist feature, but also a Bitcoin affiliate program. The feature will not only make it easier for those who are interested, to relist their products, but this will also have an important role in increasing the sales chances of a particular product, by making the whole process of relisting something easier for all of its users. Although this is an interesting addition that is bound to have a lot of success, the cream of the crop is actually the world-class Bitcoin affiliate program that has been introduced. To put things better into perspective, those who would like to support CryptoThrift by recommending the site to others, or who are directly responsible for one or more sales will be rewarded by the team. However, this affiliate program is unlike others, thanks to the incredible rewards that the site is offering for a limited period of time. With this in mind, users who refer someone new can earn as much as one bitcoin for their effort, but also continuously earn 1% of the purchases made by the users which have been referred during their first 90 days on the site. While the platform was hit by a hack last year, CryptoThrift is now also proud to announce that they have made a couple of security improvements which strive to ensure that no other hacks will take place in the future, thus promising absolute privacy and security to their users. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, what do you personally think about the improvements brought over to CryptoThrift? Have you ever tried out the marketplace?

In January of this year, European Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp got hacked and lost a fair chunk of money. Earlier today, Bitstamp informed its customers about a new phishing email making the rounds, asking users to submit a \u201cverification request\u201d. Phishing emails are nothing new under the sun, as these type of hacking attempts have been around for as long as the Internet exists. And Bitcoin has become a target of this kind of phishing attempts on more than one occasion as well, as Bitcoin is untraceable and irreversible money, after all. The choice to go after Bitstamp customers may be a smart move on behalf of the people behind this phishing attempt though. Many, if not all of Bitstamp\u2019s user base are aware the exchange has been hacked little over a month ago, and seeing an email from BitStamp \u2013 which looks rather legit (more onthat in a bit) to be honest \u2013 asking users to comply with a change in free structure is not that strange. However, as we all know, no Bitcoin-related service will ever ask you to confirm details by creating a link[ed button] sent via email. Unfortunately for all of us, once you have an operation that involves a human factor, there is always a chance of people clicking the button & getting hacked. In turn, they will blame Bitstamp for sending out this email, and we will see mainstream media claiming how Bitstamp \u201cremains insecure after the security breach\u201d et cetera. But that is not all, as there are other clues to be found as well as to why this email is not coming from Bitstamp themselves. Granted, you have to look a bit closer, but it\u2019s not that hard to do or even time-consuming. For starters, the address where the email is supposedly coming from. Official Bitstamp emails are always sent from \u201c[email protected]\u201d, at least when updates regarding the service is concerned. For example, when Bitstamp sent their official email regarding the change in fee structure, it came from that email address. This phishing email, on the other hand, is being sent from [email protected] [which is obviously a spoofed email address], and is not an address Bitstamp ever uses. Granted, withdrawal and deposit confirmation emails are sent from [email protected], but there is no hyphen in that email address, is there? Regarding the spoofed email address, if your mail client/webmail has mail headers enabled, you can also see through which mail server the message was relayed. Bitstamp will never send any email relayed by Gmail servers, as they have their own mailing servers to take care of outgoing communication to their customers. Also, why would Bitstamp ask their users to SUBMIT a verification request? If this email was legitimately coming from Bitstamp themselves, shouldn\u2019t be we CONFIRMING a request to begin with? And what kind of verification are we talking about in the first place, as this is just about a change in the fee structure? Regardless of how you look at it, there are plenty of signs that this is not a genuine Bitstamp email but rather a phishing attempt.

Assuming this story is true, it may have to do with the SQL injection vulnerability found in Yoast SEO, a very popular WordPress plugin. But then again, why is a digital currency exchange platform using WordPress in the first place? If you have not been living under a rock over the past few months, you will have seen many headlines concerning Bitcoin and other digital currency exchanges in 2015. Both January and February have been very sad months, with over half a dozen exchanges being breached or forced to shut down for various reasons. AllCrypt is the latest addition to that list, as the website now holds a message saying that the platform has been breached and over 40 Bitcoin has been stolen. But there are some very strange \u201cfacts\u201d in the message provided by the AllCrypt owner, \u201cfacts\u201d which raise even more questions than answers if you ask me. Needless to say, when you run a digital currency exchange, you paint a target on your back for hackers, hoodlums and people who will try to exploit your platform in every way possible. By using WordPress \u2013 a popular solution for blogs and news sites \u2013 to serve as your digital currency exchange\u2019s platform, you are putting the cat among the pigeons. While it is no secret that WordPress is a great platform, it is also no secret that some of its features and plugins have more security holes in them compared to any other similar offering in existence. It is a good thing to have so many independent developers working on bringing tools to the masses, but not every developer prides himself/herself on top notch security. Especially when it comes to widely popular WordPress plugins, such as Yoast SEO \u2013 which is used by over 90% of all WordPress site owners \u2013 security is not the greatest concern. However, a recent report showed that this popular plugin is vulnerable to SQL injections, which could give an assailant access to everything on your WordPress site. If you ever owned \u2013 or are planning to own \u2013 a WordPress website, make sure to update your plugins on a daily basis, either manually or automatically. Granted, these updates can sometimes break things that need to be fixed afterwards through a patch or a rollback. But the amount of times this happens compared to useful [security] updates is neglectable. According to the AllCrypt site owner, someone used an exploit in order to access the WordPress admin area, uploaded some files [of unknown original or purpose], finds the Bitcoin wallet on the network and starts flooding it with withdrawal requests. Due to the built-in security, the AllCrypt Bitcoin wallet locks up until a valid withdrawal request is made by any of the platform\u2019s users. Apparently, the hacker(s) made a legitimate withdrawal request in order to unlock the AllCrypt Bitcoin wallet, and managed to steal 42 Bitcoin in funds. Thirty BTC belonged to customers, whereas the remaining 12 BTC was funds held by AllCrypt. A very sad day for all of those affected, and we hope they will be refunded in some way. By the looks of things, the AllCrypt owner is in a very emotional state right [and understandably so], but we sincerely hope he/she will do everything humanly possible in order to refund customers. If not, charges may be pressed against them, which would only make matters worse after such a hack took place. Wez will keep an eye on the situation and report back once we found out more information as to what happened exactly.

Coyno is still in beta but already has many users as it allows you to view your cash flow and transaction details. It received $26,000 in funding from Axel plug and play accelerator which uses counselling and mentoring to boost newly started businesses. It also has tight security and it watches the transactions from a HD seed without actually touching the keys. This means it is unable to touch the funds in the wallets. It also has real-time data and shows the transactions in fiat. This is a large breakthrough as it is very helpful to society which is increasingly using cryptocurrencies. It is also a profitable field as not many services offer those that Coyno does. \u201cCoyno sits as a watch-only layer on top of whatever wallet or exchange you\u2019re using.\u201d It boasts the ability to create overview reports of every individual wallet. It has the feature to see where the Bitcoins came from and where they went which is an especially useful feature as it is easy to forget whose Bitcoins you need to send and whose you have already sent. It is also rapidly expanding its operations and is hoping to add new features to its service. It plans to add notifications which mean they send an email whenever Bitcoins leave your wallet. Currently it only supports a few addresses such as Bitcoin wallet, coin base and armory; however it hopes to add more wallets such as Hive and Multibit. It also wants to incorporate exchanges and tax reports. Bitcoins anonymity also means that a way of tracking transactions and who they are from seems like a solution that should be used. In the near future hopefully we will have more advanced ways of sorting and accounting our transactions but this is a step in the right direction. When the full one is released it will show how this will affect Bitcoin in the future and how there are many unexplored fields still out there for new and upcoming services. \u201c[Current] wallets are nice, but just look at a Bitcoin address. When I look at my phone wallet, it\u2019s impossible to remember what [transactions] happened at the time unless I write it down. Just to have a graphical representation, to help you use Bitcoin the right way, is going to be absolutely crucial to mainstream adoption.\u201d explained co-founder Erasmus Hagen when asked about how his service can benefit the Bitcoin community. It lets you test it and give feedback on how they can improve which means they will be improving more rapidly and will suit the needs of the Bitcoin society. Many users have already tried and loved the beta and hopefully it will become a developed and successful service as it has the all the great features needed and more. The beta can be accessed at https://coyno.com/ and requires an account to be created.", "date": "2015-03-17T22:12:23+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 17}

Both are directly related to reward, with one rewarding physically and the other rewarding financially, FitCoin has stepped into the spotlight, pairing the two industries together in a new and unique project. Bitcoin has become the currency of choice for FitCoin developers as fitness meets physical performance in a experiment attempted never before. FitCoin allows the customer to exercise whilst being rewarded for their physical exertion in Bitcoin. The unique coin works on a Proof Of Human Work algorithm which essentially allows user to earn while they burn (calories). The FitCoin App allows users to monitor the intensity of their exercises with payments being made depending on the intensity of them. FitCoin has a big vision as it aims to incorporate its systems in Adidas and various other brands currently associated with health and personal well being. Whilst the app is currently easy to install and use, the developers of FitCoin hope to increase the user base of the App ultimately increasing the popularity of Bitcoin. Emphasizing the benefits provided by the digital cryptocurrency, the company hope to encourage the use of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, as the currency of choice for those looking for a rewarding workout. With FitCoin set to climb to the top of the industry joining the likes of Adidas, Bitcoin is set to take another dip into uncharted waters. Bitcoins integration into the fitness market will be sure to set markets on fire, with FitCoin being the only experiment of its kind to develop the technology needed for Bitcoin integration.

Up until this point, no less than seven retailers have joined the Ghent Bitcoincity project, with [hopefully] many more to come after the major event on April 18th. PIET Moodshop is the latest brick-and-mortar store to start accepting Bitcoin in Ghent. One of the main advantages of the Ghent Bitcoincity initiative is the fact that nearly every participating retailer offers a different type of product to customers willing to pay in Bitcoin. Granted, there is a restaurant on board, which is a major step forward for raising Bitcoin awareness in the vibrant city of Ghent. But what about Arpeggio Music, Life-ID or Whitespace? PIET Moodshop is not a store you would expect to see on the list of participating merchants, but that is also what makes it so unique. Concept stores in Belgium are becoming an emerging trend, and once you visit one of these stores, chances are very real you won\u2019t walk away empty-handed. There are so many interesting and nifty gadgets to be found in concept stores these days! You may be wondering where the name \u201cPIET Moodshop\u201d is coming from. Let\u2019s start off by explaining the \u201cPIET\u201d part, which has nothing to do with the name of the store owner mind you. This concept store is located at the Sint-PIETernieuwsstraat in Ghent, a street name some of you may recognize as it is also home to \u201cVooruit\u201d, a famous art gallery. The city of Ghent is known for bringing together historical buildings and advanced technological ideas, which is perfectly embodied by PIET Moodshop accepting Bitcoin payments. The store itself is situated in a historical building, which used to be a drugstore many moons ago. In fact, the shelves and drawers used by the drugstore owners are still being used by PIET Moodshop this very day. It has to be said however that the original plan did not include turning PIET Moodshop into a full-fledged store for more than a few months. Most of our readers will know the concept of a pop-up store; that is a shop selling products for a few months before closing up shop once again. Pop-up shops are usually themed around a certain holiday or time of year. Due to the overwhelming success however, PIET Moodshop has remained in business and is now looking to attract the younger generation by accepting Bitcoin payments. In-store Bitcoin payments are processed by BitKassa, a very popular Bitcoin payment platform used by many merchants in both Belgium and The Netherlands. Whether you are looking for a unique gift for someone you care about or just want to admire some of the crafty objects to be found here, PIET Moodshop is the place to be for everyone visiting the city of Ghent. If you are interested in exploring the store itself, but cannot make it to Ghent any time soon, you will be pleased to hear that all of their items can be purchased through the PIET Moodshop webstore. At this point, it is unsure whether or not online customers will also be able to pay with Bitcoin in the [near] future though.

Or to be more precise, Rakuten.com customers can sue Bitcoin to pay for goods sold in the US marketplace. Other global Rakuten marketplaces are set to follow in these footsteps in the near future. Bitcoin enthusiasts around the world will rejoice at the news of Rakuten finally adopting Bitcoin as an alternative payment method. However, there was even more speculation as to which Bitcoin payment processing company Rakuten would choose, as there are quite a few different offerings to pick from. Hardly anyone expected that it would not be one of the major names such as Coinbase or BitPay. But In the world of Bitcoin and digital currencies, nothing is ever set in stone, and Rakuten\u2019s choice of BitNet to process Bitcoin payments is just one of the many examples. But who is this BitNet and where do they come from? You may recall the BitNet name from the headlines the company made after their successful round of seed funding in 2014. A total of US$14 million was raised from investors such as Highland Capital Partners, Rakuten itself and investors who already had a prior investment in the BitNet company. Rakuten becomes one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world to accept Bitcoin as a payment method, which can only be beneficial to Bitcoin awareness and adoption on a global scale. On the flipside, Rakuten merchants will also experience the many benefits stemming from accepting this digital currency as a payment method, such as lower fees, no price volatility and most importantly, no chargebacks. \u201cRakuten\u2019s mission is to empower the world through the Internet. Not only can bitcoin support this vision by helping our merchants better compete globally, but it also has the potential to benefit society by enhancing the security, privacy, and convenience of financial transactions. This is one of the reasons why we invested in Bitnet last year and we look forward to working with them in our US marketplace.\u201d In order to get the ball rolling with Bitcoin payments, Rakuten.com [available only to the USA and Canada] has started accepting bitcoin as of today. Additional major Rakuten marketplaces, such as Germany and Austria, will follow in the near future. No official ETA has been provided in regards to when this will take place though. \u201cRakuten\u2019s global marketplaces are great examples of how digital currencies can impact global commerce. We\u2019re excited to join with Rakuten in helping both merchants and shoppers reap the benefits of this new technology,\u201d John McDonnell, Co-Founder & CEO of BitNet told BTCFeed.

BitPay, the world\u2019s leading Bitcoin payment processor, has recently announced two major partnerships that will take both the company and our beloved digital currency to a new level. Most of our readers may have never heard of NetSuite before, so allow us to explain. NetSuite is a provider of cloud-based management software solutions, and they currently serve roughly 24,00 customers [businesses and subsidiaries] on a global scale. Whether a company is looking for an e-commerce solution or wants to improve their customer relationship management, NetSuite is the solution for you. Now that NetSuite has implemented the tracking, acceptance and account feature for Bitcoin payments, things can only get better from here on out. BTC4ERP is the name of NetSuite\u2019s Bitcoin Transaction Coordinator applications, which lets users activate the Bitcoin payment feature for their [online] business. Furthermore, every NetSuite user who uses the BTC4ERP app will be able to make use of general ledger accounting with a simple software package. The best part about all of this is that everything will be done from within the NetSuite ecosystem. But there is more for Bitcoin enthusiasts, as customers can designate bitcoin as a normal payment method or even as a foreign currency. This last option has an additional benefit as it provides transparent accounting alongside other traditional payment methods. For those of us living outside of the United States, Heartland Payment Systems will not be as well-known, even though they are one of the largest payment processors in the US. Not just in the online space, mind you, as Heartland also offers mobile commerce, point of sale, payroll and marketing solutions to over 300,000 businesses and educational locations. The referral partnership between BitPay and Heartland helps to bring Bitcoin payment technology to organizations and businesses interested in exploring new payment methods. Furthermore, Heartland\u2019s industry-leading sales professionals will identify the businesses and organizations to benefit most from accepting bitcoin payments.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/coinffeine-brings-bitcoin-and-mobile-payments-together/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Coinffeine Brings Bitcoin And Mobile Payments Together", "content": "One of the areas where Bitcoin could make a serious splash is in the world of mobile payments. Feature phone and smartphone sales numbers are on the rise year after year, especially in emerging markets such as South America and Africa. However, sending money over SMS remains a tricky challenge, and Bitcoin could be the perfect technology to overcome those barriers. Coinffeine is one interesting Bitcoin company to keep an eye on during 2015 and years to come. This company has been exploring the potential of uniting Bitcoin with Airtime, a popular means of sending money in African countries. For example, paying for a coffee in Kenya is usually done with Airtime, as merchants there have recognized the advantages linked to accepting mobile payments. Fun fact : Airtime is actually the transfer of mobile phone balance, which is then exchanged to local currency by the merchant. The most popular service using irtime as a way to send mobile payments is called M-Pesa. As awesome as the idea of paying with mobile balance may sound, it\u2019s not a vable solution for every country in the world. Especially when looking at Western countries, paying bills with mobile phone balance simply makes no sense at all. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that this service has no use cases, as it could also be used to purchase digital goods. In Spain for example, you can buy a wide variety of digital goods with mobile phone balance, such as applications, games and even Bitcoins. Even though this idea sounds simple to execute, the reality is far different unfortunately. Handling big amounts of digital currency is very risky, and with the pending regulations looming over all of our heads, it is not an opportune time to undertake such a venture at this time. Not to mention that \u2013 in Spain at least \u2013 selling Bitcoin in exchange for mobile phone balance will most likely require operators to obtain a money transmitting license in the future. Needless to say that , assuming this would be the case, there is no incentive to run such a service any time soon, as the downsides and costs would far outweigh the benefits. The way Coinffeine works can be compared to the modus operandi of BitTorrent, combined with the financial aspect of Paypal. In simple terms, users would be able to send payments to other users automatically in exchange for bitcoins. As these bitcoins would be transferred from person to person \u2013 without any banks or intermediary parties being involved \u2013 a true peer-to-peer solution is born. But there are other benefits to this idea as well. Perhaps the most important incentive is the reduction of operating costs by offering contracts between individuals, instead of using services provided by a service provider. Furthermore, such a service would not be in competition with banks and other financial institutions. For the time being, Coinffeine users will be able to purchase bitcoins with their account balance allocated to their bank account or payment processor balance. However, down the line, this same service could be used to integrate with mobile payments in one way or another. Maybe Airtime will become a viable use case to buy bitcoins in the future.

Robert has seen a future in Bitcoin and has therefore decided to take the concept to a new level and help out the community in Hong Kong. As the ATM can be found in a popular city mall, not only have we been able to learn more about such a business, but we\u2019ve also received exclusive insight into how these devices operate, and how popular they really are. When did you get involved with Bitcoin? I got involved with Bitcoin over in 2013 when someone posted a paid event on Facebook to learn about the cryptocurrency. Were you one of the lucky ones who had Bitcoin when the prices reached $1200? If yes, did you keep them or sell them? When price was at $1200, I was mining litecoins and altcoins. I have a constant amount of Bitcoin in my portfolio and liquidity for my business, so I enjoy speculating on altcoins and IPOs. What made you think of Bitcoin as the currency of the future? I am not sure Bitcoin will replace all currency in the world unless the world governments promote it or an end of the world event happens. However, I think of Bitcoin as an internet currency which is probably because of its convenience. With this in mind, Bitcoin allows people to buy games and products across the border at a very low cost. Please tell us a little more about your company and your Bitcoin ATM. HK Bitcoin ATM is my company. We operate Lamassu Bitcoin ATM machine inside a nice mall in the city center. Our shop is also 24/7, just like most ATMs. Make sure to check out the mining machines and robots inside our shop over in Hong Kong. Do you plan on setting up more of these all around Hong Kong, and why not, China or the world? I think we know what we are doing. We execute our plan very carefully and don\u2019t want to rollout many ATMs and end up making losses and eventually shutdown. We are doing this a step at a time. We have also ordered a Bitcoin selling module from Lamassu which should arrive shortly. We will continue to test the market and rollout a few more shops in the near future. Was your Bitcoin ATM an investment? It is both an investment, but also something I like doing for the community, thus improving the Bitcoin market all around Hong Kong. How did you get the idea? It is one of those things that suddenly come to mind, just like \u2018Hey, this is a great idea!\u2019. On a scale from 1 to 10, how successful would you consider your ATM at this moment in time? Depends on the definition of success. In terms of helping me learn more about Bitcoin Business and also profit at the same time, I would say 8 to 9. Please briefly describe how it works. Just walk into my Bitcoin shop, follow the instructions on the shop wall i.e. download a Bitcoin wallet app. After this, scan the wallet QR code on the ATM machine that we have set up. Insert the money into the machine and bam! The Bitcoin has arrived into your Bitcoin wallet. You don\u2019t need a bank account, HK id or a HK telephone number. Are there any security concerns that people should be aware of? Just some basic stuffs. If you are buying small amount of Bitcoin there is not much to be worried about. Just backup your Bitcoin wallet private address on the app. Transfer your Bitcoin to a new wallet if you plan on resetting your smartphone. If you have a lot of Bitcoin then follow YouTube instructions to create a paper wallet. Lastly don\u2019t fall for any Ponzi schemes and mining contracts which you don\u2019t understand. Chances are that if something is too good to be true, it probably isn\u2019t. If in doubt, it is always wise to check the community\u2019s opinion and verify niche forums such as Bitcointalk. Thank you very much, Robert! This brings an end to our interview. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, the honest truth is that all around the world, the Bitcoin market is emerging at an incredibly fast level. The appearance of Bitcoin ATMs like the ones found in Hong Kong will not only promote the cryptocurrency, but it will also ensure that the market will continue becoming more and more popular. In the fortunate case that ATMs like this begin appearing in other countries as well, then chances are that the market will thrive from all the points of view.", "date": "2015-03-12T20:50:59+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 12}

By the look of things, the CryptoLocker ransomware is targeting a different audience this time around, by directly going after video gamers and reviewers. No one is safe from CryptoLocker these days it seems. Original reports state that over 20 [popular] video games can be affected by the Cryptolocker ransomware, but truth be told, the list is far longer than that. Seeing as how most video games use the same type of data file extensions, more and more well-known titles are being affected by this new version of the CryptoLocker ransomware. Popular games include but are not limited to: Minecraft, Half-Life 2, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Assassin\u2019s Creed, and Metro 2033. However, multiplayer games such as World of Warcraft, Day Z, League of Legends and World of Tanks are also targeted by the ransomware. More importantly, Steam \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most popular gaming library platforms \u2013 has been reported to suffer from these attacks as well. And the bad news doesn\u2019t stop there unfortunately. Video game developers will also feel the wrath of this new CryptoLocker ransomware version, as game development software is vulnerable as well. RPG Maker, Unity 3D and Unreal Engine are some of the examples which have been verified to be subject to infection by CryptoLocker. Even though this is a new version of CryptoLocker [or so it appears to be anyway] the modus operandi of this ransomware remains the same. Important files are encrypted, the user gets a warning about being infected with CryptoLocker and the fact they have to pay up in order to have their files decrypted again. Payment can be done with Bitcoin and credit card, and the payment procedure itself is operating through a website located in the TOR domain. According to a report by Bromium Labs, every instance of the CryptoLocker ransomware generates its very own Bitcoin wallet address. Besides encrypting and decrypting files on a host\u2019s computer, the CryptoLocker ransomware also generates its own Bitcoin address once a computer has been infected. With 185 file extensions proven to be vulnerable to the new CryptoLocker ransomware, it is expected that many individuals and companies will be affected down the line. Needless to say, the fact that Bitcoin is somehow tied to restoring your files will not instill any confidence in the disruptive digital currency.

The more people know about Bitcoin, the better chance we all have of more people using the technology and currency in their daily lives. Bitcoin startup \u201c21 Inc.\u201d is hinting at some form of mass consumer adoption after unveiling their funding numbers. Until this very day, hardly anyone had heard about a Bitcoin startup called \u201c21 Inc.\u201d, let alone know of their whereabouts in Silicon Valley. But that doesn\u2019t mean this startup has been sitting on their hands in the meantime, as the team managed to convince several big names in the venture capital space to back their efforts. Their venture? Turning the Bitcoin technology into something usable for mass-marketed purposes. Speaking of convincing big names in the venture capital space, 21 Inc. managed to raise a whopping US$116 million in venture funding, which shatters any and all records previously set by other digital currency-related companies. However, the exact operations of \u201c21 Inc.\u201d remain unclear at this point in time. Matthew Pauker, Co-founder and CEO of 21 Inc said we would see \u201cseveral interesting developments over the coming weeks and months.\u201d All of that mystery was enough to convince big investor names such as Andreessen Horowitz, RRE Ventures; a Chinese private-equity firm called Yuan Capital, and a strategic stake is going to Qualcomm. That last name will ring a bell for most people, as Qualcomm makes chips that we can find in most everyday devices such as smartphones and tablets. But the list does not end there, as more investor names have been revealed. Khosla Ventures, Data Collective, Paypal co-founders Max Levchin and Peter Thiel, Ebay Inc. co-founder Jeff Skoll, Expedia Inc. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, Zynga Inc. co-founder Mark Pincus and Dropbox Inc. CEO Drew Houston have all backed the efforts of 21 Inc. Judging from that list of investors, there is only one name that doesn\u2019t seem to fit the profile: Qualcomm. Mr. Pauker hopes to put Qualcomm\u2019s mass-marketing and production capabilities to good use in order to come up with electronic devices using blockchain technology. Rumours are already spreading about 21 Inc. aiming to create some form of hardware component to promote the \u201cThe Internet of Things\u201d idea. Most electronic gadgets we have in our possession this very day are gathering a ton of personal and sensitive information about the people using them. Seeing as how the blockchain is free from any governmental oversight in regards to who owns or controls the data, the risk information manipulation could become a non-issue in the future. One of the main reasons why Bitcoin has failed to gain a large foothold in the everyday lives of the global population is because of the lack of proper education. Most people still see Bitcoin as a weak digital currency alternative to fiat currency. Bitcoin enthusiasts are well aware of the technological advancements Bitcoin can bring to the world population, but the question remains whether or not this technology is far ahead of its time. \u201cNone of this will matter if bitcoin doesn\u2019t achieve mass adoption. Bitcoin is going to change the way that people and businesses and even machines interact with each other. But for bitcoin to realize that vision we need mass adoption. It can\u2019t just be for Silicon Valley,\u201d Matthew Pauker told BTCFeed.

However, at that point in time it remained unclear as to how Bter would pay back customers affected by this security breach. We have received more detailed information on how this process will work exactly. Before we get started, we need to make one thing clear : not all affected users will receive their Bitcoin refunds at the same time. Considering the amount stolen by the person/people responsible for the Bter hack, it will take some time in order to provide enough liquidity to process all refunds. However, Bter has said they will honour all losses and refund every customer accordingly. Affected users who were holding Bitcoin on the Bter exchange at the time of the security breach will receive an additional form of compensation. Eligible users will receive Bter\u2019s half year\u2019s trading fee in proportion to the amount of BTC they owed at that time. A nice gesture from the Bter team, which will be greatly appreciated by those customers who opt to keep on trading on this Bitcoin exchange platform. All affected users will also receive one month of 0% trading fees. In order to separate the lost BTC balance from the current BTC balance in the user account section, Bter has renamed the funds owed to the customer to \u201cBTC_B\u201d. This will remain the reference for outstanding refunds until every single Satoshi has been paid back to affected customers. Looking at this from a bookkeeping point of view, it makes sense for Bter to separate both balances. Part of the refunds will be coming from the profits generated by the Bter Bitcoin exchange platform. In fact, all of the profits for the foreseeable future will be sued to pay back affected customers. Depending on how much trading volume Bter can generate after being hacked twice in six months, using profits to cover up losses may take far longer than anticipated. However, that is not the only source of profit revenue for Bter. The company plans to launch other companies later this year, and if there is still outstanding funds to be paid back by that time, profits from these new companies will also be used to pay back affected customers. Despite being hacked twice in a few months, Bter has managed to secure 1,000 Bitcoin in funding from their partner JUA.COM. This funds, together with other capital injections to be sought by the Bter team, will help in speeding up the customer refund process.

While not everything can be bought with Bitcoin just yet [or at least, not in a straightforward way without too much hassle], one of the most commonly purchased on the world can be bought with digital currency. So if you are a smoker, why not buy some cigarettes with Bitcoin at discounted prices? One of the major selling points for merchants and retailers to use Bitcoin payments is the fact they can shave off a ton of overhead costs compared to more, traditional payment methods. No one wants to use credit cards with their 3-5% fee per transaction and having to wait 30 days or more before even receiving the money in their bank account. Unless that is your only option of course. However, Bitcoin may not be a viable alternative for any retailer. If you run a small company, the effect Bitcoin can have on your business model is far bigger compared to bigger stores and chains. Furthermore, as a small business owner, you are more inclined ovf giving your customers additional discounts when they pay with Bitcoin, seeing as how they save you a lot of money by not using their credit or debit cards. DutyFree.io is a very small business, run by BitcoinTalk forum member only. This service has been in existence since February of last year, and served a lot of customers around the world so far. But what makes DutyFree.io so attractive, considering this is not the only site where you can buy cigarettes online? That can be attributed to their extremely low costs for cigarettes in general. DutyFree.io ships their goods from the country of Moldova, located in Eastern Europe. In Moldova, cigarettes [among other goods] are far cheaper compared to prices in the Western world. In fact, the order I placed myself was nearly 50% cheaper compared to retail prices over here. Such cheap prices often raise the question, on whether or not this service is legal. There is no definitive answer to that, as it is completely different from country to country. For most Western countries, there will be no issue as long as you order two cartons of cigarettes or less per order, in order to avoid any unwanted attention from the customs office. However, luck plays a small factor in this as well, so there is no way to guarantee your package will not be intercepted. The owners of DutyFree.io will take every precaution they possibly can in order to make sure your cigarettes pass the customs office without a hitch. By using plain unmarked shipping boxes, and not making their packages too bulky, everything appears totally inconspicuous. Besides, you wouldn\u2019t be the first person in the world to receive a package from Moldova, would you? Contrary to popular belief, such cheap cigarettes are not knock-offs, but the actual brand. Moldova and other Eastern European countries have fairly low taxation on these luxury goods. But that is to as much to our benefit as it is to the people living in Moldova, so we won\u2019t complain about that at all. One thing that really sets DutyFree.io apart from similar websites is their affiliate program. For every first-time user you refer to the website and places an order, they will get a US$10 discount on their first order. In exchange, you as a referrer will also receive US$10 in in-store credit, which can be used towards future purchases from DutyFree.io.

Cleveland in Ohio used to be one of those places, but things might change very soon now that its citizens can start using their very own Bitcoin ATM which has been recently installed. Contrary to the battle of Bitcoin ATM manufacturers going on over in Manhattan = where Lamassu is duking it out with SkyHook \u2013 the machine installed in Cleveland is a General Bytes ATM, It has to be said though that General Bytes also installed one Bitcoin ATM in Manhattan, as we mentioned in this article. Cleveland\u2019s Bitcoin ATM can be found over at Everything Computer & Electronics in Lakewood, which lets users buy Bitcoin in exchange for fiat currency seven days a week. It is important to note however that this Bitcoin ATM has a daily buy limit of US$2,500 in place, which means customers will have to access the machine early to avoid a delay in purchasing Bitcoin from the device. Speaking of purchasing Bitcoin with fiat currency, this Bitcoin AT charges a 5% fee on all transactions. In order to comply with the KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations, the General Bytes Bitcoin ATM in Lakewood has a built-in document ID scanner and an also read your fingerprint. It looks like customers who want to buy Bitcoin above a certain limit will need to provide a document to verify their identity, which is then taken a screenshot of with the webcam built into the Bitcoin ATM. Coinnective is a new initiative in the world of Bitcoin, with the main focus on making it easier to buy Bitcoin. Furthermore, Coinnective also offers professional custom Bitcoin integration services for merchants. In order to do so, the company integrates Bitcoin and other alternate digital currencies as a payment solution. Bitcoin ATM placement is one of the multiple ways to make buying Bitcoin easier for customers all around the world. The General Bytes Bitcoin ATM in Cleveland \u2013 which is operated by Coinnective \u2013 is the first device of many more to come to bring Bitcoin and everyday users closer together. Do keep in mind that these Bitcoin ATM\u2019s will only placed at your location if you are an eligible merchant. Last but not least, it is also possible to buy Bitcoin directly through the Coinnective website by filling in a small form. Orders with a value of US$1,000 or above will need to attach a copy of their ID in order to comply with KYC/AML procedures. Customers have a three hour window in order to deposit the money per the instructions emailed by Coinnective, otherwise the order will be cancelled. Deposits that are not paid in cash will not be processed and simply returned to the original sender. Detailed instructions on how to buy Bitcoin from Coinnective can be found here.

In Spain however, they just added Bitcoin functionality to 10,000 existing ATM, thanks to a partnership between BTCPoint, national bank Banc Sabadell and Hal-Cash. Instead of installing a ton of brand new Bitcoin ATm\u2019s, which also require physical access to the locations and several bits of paperwork which allow you to install a machine there, it is far more easier to convert existing ATM\u2019s into Bitcoin ATM\u2019s. Or to be more precise, it is a lot easier if you have a national bank willing to collaborate on the effort. Unlike most traditional Bitcoin ATM\u2019s, these 10,000 bank ATm\u2019s will allow users to obtain cash in exchange for their Bitcoins. To achieve this, users simply have to enter the amount of money they want to withdraw from an ATM using the BTCPoint application, and send the designated amount of Bitcoin to a wallet address belonging to BTCPoint. \u201cOnce you send your Bitcoin to our address, you\u2019ll receive a text message with a [PIN] code and with that code you can go to any ATM \u2013 operated by Banc Sabadell, Banco Popular, Abance and EVO Bank \u2013 and receive cash right away,\u201d BTCPoint\u2019s co-founder and COO Alex Lopera told us. What makes this service truly unique and incredibly useful is the fact that you do not need to have a credit card or bank account with any of the banks involved. But that may not even be the best part, as this Bitcoin-to-ficat conversion system is running on a 0% commission structure, which is something we very rarely witness in the world of Bitcoin ATM\u2019s. Needless to say, manufacturing Bitcoin ATM\u2019s may sound like a lot of fun, but it really isn\u2019t. Not just because it takes a while before your components are ready to be assembled, but also because these devices are incredibly heavy to ship to different locations. And seeing how bank ATM\u2019s already have the infrastructure in place, the logical choice seems to be to go after them in order to create valuable partnerships. \u201cWe are focusing on changing Bitcoin into cash, and we\u2019re also talking with different credit card processors, who could enable the buy option so you can buy at a very low fee. The team is currently taking to US-based and Latin American banks to expand the service.\u201d Alex Lopera told BTCFeed.

Not only will this decision aid in providing the best possible service to its customers, but it also gives OKCoin a very competitive edge over its competitors. Do keep in mind this fee change will only affect the USD Master Fee, as USD Taker Fees remain unaffected. In fact, OKCoin is not the first Bitcoin exchange platform to lower its USD Master Fees to 0%, as Coinbase has made the same move a little while ago. Other exchanges such as Bitstamp (0.1%-0.25%) , Bitfinex (0-0.1%) and BTC-e (0.2%) are still charging a small fee for Bitcoin spot trading, which may very well be removed in the future in order to keep up with the competition. Speaking of the USD Taker Fee on OKCoin,, they are some of the lowest to be found on Bitcoin exchange platforms around the world. Whereas competitors BitStamp (0.1%-0.25%), Coinbase (0.25%), Bitfinex (0.2%) and BTC-e (0.2%) all charge slightly higher fees, OKCoin is being aggressively competitive in this area, offering Bitcoin spot traders some of the lowest fees on one of the world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin exchange platforms. When we look at some of the other fees being charged by the OKCoin platform, you can see why this is one of the most popular Bitcoin exchange platforms in the whole wide world. For instance, USD withdrawals are subject to just a 0.10% fee (with a minimum amount of US$15 being one of the requirements). Both Bitcoin and Litecoin withdrawals through the OKCoin platform are subject of 0% fees \u2013 notwithstanding a standard transaction fee may be applied to your withdrawal. This lack of additional fees is on part with similar Bitcoin exchange platforms around the world. However, it creates a very competitive package for Bitcoin traders worldwide. OKCoin is doing quite well as of late on the regular Bitcoin exchange market as well, as it has fortified its position as China\u2019s number two Bitcoin exchange, following on the heels of BTC China. With these reduces fees coming to the OKCoin platform on March 6th, it will be interesting to see if they can overtake BTC China in the near future.

For those of you who haven\u2019t yet, Cryptolocker encrypts a ton of important files located on your computer, and forces users to pay for getting them decrypted again. This payment can be completed with either a credit card or Bitcoin, which is why it has caught the eye of mainstream media across the world. The Free University of Amsterdam is the latest victim of this nasty piece of malware. Luckily for the IT service in charge of keeping everything organized at the Free University of Amsterdam, no important files have been lost to this piece of malware to date. However, with over 200 computers affected by Cryptolocker, there was plenty of reason for great concern. Especially considering it is not the first time some of the University\u2019s computers have been infected. Cryptolocker usually hides in email attachments, making universities across the world a very likely target to become infected sooner or later. Considering how victims will [temporarily] lose access to some of their most important files, a fair amount of people would gladly pay up the requested amount in order to decrypt their documents. However, providing the malware creators with either credit card or Bitcoin details only makes matters worse. The reason why the Cryptolocker malware has been making headlines over the past month or so is not because mainstream media worries too much about the malware itself, but because the creators give victims an option to pay with Bitcoin. Ever since Bitcoin\u2019s inception in 2008, the disruptive digital currency seems to be a preferred \u201cmethod of payment\u201d for malicious individuals. Bitcoin-related malware, virii and keyloggers have been on the rise over the past year and a half. Back in 2014, a Kaspersky study showed that 22% of all financial threats in the form of viruses, malware or otherwise have Bitcoin implications. The biggest part of that comes from software which secretly installs an application to mine Bitcoin on the victim\u2019s computer. Malicious individuals are drawn to Bitcoin as a way to force unsuspecting victims to pay up in order to restore computer access. Bitcoin payments, while publicly visible on the blockchain \u2013 which is a public ledger of all transactions ever since its inception \u2013 are non-refundable and anonymous up to a certain point, making it very hard to track down the owner of a Bitcoin address.

Not just because they are big fans of Bitcoin in general and are even listing their own Bitcoin trade fund on NASDAQ soon \u2013 but also because they don\u2019t shy away from some remarkable comments. Even though both Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are extremely busy these days in order to get the Gemini exchange launched in the near future, they did manage to find time in order to talk to the mainstream media about Bitcoin. And more importantly, the Winklevii give us their opinions on why Bitcoin will become a globally dominant financial system. For those of you who haven\u2019t heard about the Gemini venture yet, allow us to briefly explain. Gemini will be a fully regulated Bitcoin exchange platform, where both individuals and companies can safely and securely buy or sell bitcoins. According to the Winklevoss twins, Gemini \u201cwill be the first mature financial tool for Bitcoin\u201d. Whether we want to admit or not, 2015 has been one of the worst years for Bitcoin so far. With several exchanges being hacked or disappearing altogether and a bitcoin price that remained flat in a negative way have lead many people to believe that there will be no long-term future for Bitcoin. On the other hand, we have seen Bitcoin-related companies receiving a \u201cnod of approval\u201d from the current financial \u201cbrass\u201d during several rounds of seed funding. Granted,all of the above is not creating a favorable situation for Bitcoin enthusiasts and companies all around the world, but there is a positive side to this story as well. As \u201cawkward\u201d as the position Bitcoin is in right now may look, it is next to impossible to become even more awkward. In fact, one could go as far as saying that things can only get better from this point forward. And with projects such as \u201cBIT\u201d \u2013 a Bitcoin trust allowing any customer to buy shares \u2013 is just one of the many examples of how the tide is slowly turning. Especially considering the fact that anyone can use BIT to buy shares, instead of just government-accredited investors, could prove to have a positive influence on the Bitcoin price in the future. One of the key areas that really needs work is the public perception of Bitcoin. When you ask random people if they know Bitcoin and what they think about it, most of them will only mention the negative news they have been hearing or reading about. There is only one possible solution to this problem: Bitcoin needs a PR makeover very soon. However, we can not just blame mainstream media for the negative public perception of Bitcoin. A lot of people still need to be educated on digital currency in a proper way, and while there are several undertakings to make this plan a reality, many enthusiasts strongly feel that more effort should go into Bitcoin education. After all, if people have no idea what Bitcoin is or does, why would they even bother to use it? \u201cAmerica hasn\u2019t really come online yet, but this won\u2019t persist forever. Within a few months, it will be a very different story. There are much more interesting startups and initiatives that are going to come online in the next six months that are positive for price. As the price rises and the ecosystem develops, perceptions will shift.\u201d The name Winklevoss twins, combined with Bitcoin \u2013 which has become a target for hackers, thieves and hoodlums over the past few months \u2013 may bring a lot of challenges to the table. However, by bringing together the nation\u2019s top security experts, financial engineers and technologists, the Gemini Bitcoin exchange should be far more secure compared to other exchanges in existence today. \u201cWhen email first came out I don\u2019t think there was a compelling argument to say you need to use this to make your life better. It\u2019s really up to the entrepreneurs and the technologists to build the infrastructure and applications out so that it\u2019s super easy \u2014 and dummy-proof, so to speak \u2014 to use.\u201d \u2013 Winklevoss twins Despite what most crypto anarchists are hoping for, the Winklevoss twins believe that Bitcoin will not replace fiat currencies anytime soon. That does not mean that both options cannot co-exist and even benefit one another though. Bitcoin still has a long way to go in order to be even remotely on par with fiat currency, as price volatility needs to be all but eliminated and market liquidity needs to be improved dramatically. Not to mention, regulation is a necessary step in order to further legitimize Bitcoin as a usable currency. \u201cThere will be a future where people will use Bitcoin and they won\u2019t even know they\u2019re using it. At that point it\u2019s everywhere \u2014 it\u2019s a part of global finance, it\u2019s a part of our everyday lives. In the same way using email was very difficult and the edge of technology \u2026 it\u2019s always difficult, it\u2019s problematic, it\u2019s painful to use, and we\u2019re at that point in Bitcoin right now. The point where we\u2019re beyond it is the point where people don\u2019t think of email as the bleeding edge of tech because it works so well everyone uses it \u2026 I think it\u2019s going to get to that point. We\u2019ll be in a situation where the majority value transferred around the world will use the Bitcoin protocol.\u201d Source : http://uk.businessinsider.com/winklevoss-twins-bitcoin-will-dominate-global-finance-2015-3", "date": "2015-03-11T21:48:46+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 11}

Serving a variety of food products, the juice Bar has become the latest establishment to accept Bitcoin. Recognising Bitcoins benefits they stated the following: Bitcoin and its use on everyday life is being pioneered by projects similar to SANE which allow Bitcoin users to use Bitcoin on a daily basis the way currency is meant to be used.

Bitcoin and the food industry The food industry has been highlighted as one of the most beneficial industries for Bitcoin to expand into. Whilst Bitcoins properties make it ideal and suited to the Food and Retail markets, the bitcoin has a long way to go to make breakthroughs in these markets. Whilst Bitcoin can allow for advances in the way the industry works as a whole the simplicity behind the cryptocurrency and its integration into modern life is also highlighted as one of the main aspects making it suited to hospitality industries and services. The fact Bitcoin transactions are instant and almost free has also been seen as a favourable feature allowing for customers to send tips and pay for small items of food from restaurants and breakfasts. As seen in the juice bar, SANE, the success of Bitcoin has been put into action with the bar receiving a growing number of Bitcoin purchases.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/paypal-founder-bitcoin-doesnt-threaten-usd-reserve-currency/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Paypal Founder: Bitcoin Doesn\u2019t Threaten USD As A Reserve Currency", "content": "When Paypal announced they would integrate Bitcoin payments through BrainTree \u2013 a payment processing company owned by Paypal \u2013 the entire digital currency community was enthusiastic and excited about the future of Bitcoin. This announcement was seen as a clear \u201cthumbs up\u201d from one of their biggest competitors in the world of online payments. However, up to this day, not much has happened ever since. It makes you wonder what the creator of Paypal has to say about that. Most people fail to realize that Paypal was originally created with the mindset of becoming its very own currency, which was backed by other fiat currencies around the world. Back in the days of the birth of Paypal, regulation and legislation regarding online payments were far less strict than they are these days, and hardly any of the \u201chigher ups\u201d was paying attention to e-commerce at that point in time. Ever since then, paypal has become a household name when it comes to sending and accepting money on the Internet. By using traditional payment methods such as wire transfers and credit or debit cards, and giving them a digital jacket so you didn\u2019t have to expose that information to anyone else but Paypal, a whole new breed of internet payment systems was born. It goes without saying that a lot of people weren\u2019t too fond of the idea of paying online back in the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s. The Internet was this new disruptive technology that would either become one of the biggest inventions of the 20th century, or fall flat on its ass before the millennium was over. Little did people know at that time what a success the Internet would prove to be 25 years later. However, more and more people started seeing the benefits offered by Paypal : accept payments online, and people could still use their traditional payment methods in order to do so. it would be a win-win situation for all parties involved. As we all know by now, the only real winner in this scenario is Paypal, with their ludicrous fees of up to 3.5% per transaction between users, plus additional fees for adding and withdrawing funds to and from your Paypal balance. Peter Thiel, the creator of Paypal, should be applauded for his efforts though. Without his gutsy move of creating the world\u2019s leading online payment system, we might have never seen the birth of Bitcoin either. It\u2019s hard to judge whether or not that statement would actually be true, as history has taken its course already. Just think about what a different world we would be in right now if it wasn\u2019t for Paypal coming into existence at the right time. \u201cPayPal had these goals of creating a new currency. We failed at that, and we just created a new payment system. I think Bitcoin has succeeded on the level of a new currency, but the payment system is somewhat lacking. It\u2019s very hard to use, and that\u2019s the big challenge on the Bitcoin side.\u201d \u2013 Peter Thiel, Creator of Paypal Truth be told, if you are not tech savvy at all, both payment systems are incredibly difficult to use. However, if you have some knowledge of how computers and the Internet work, Bitcoin proves to be far less of a challenge compared to Paypal in some regards. Opening a new account is one of the areas where Bitcoin really trumps the user-friendliness [or lack thereof] of Paypal. However, when it comes to using either service, there are some similarities. Buying Bitcoin requires you to get an account on an exchange of some sorts, and the entire process will take up a few days. The same can be said of Paypal, as verifying your bank account and credit card before using them without limitations also requires several days of time. \u201cAs long as you have to have dollars to pay your taxes, if you don\u2019t have dollars to pay your taxes, people with guns will come after you and lock you up, or do something bad to you. You can use Bitcoin to pay your taxes. You still have to convert Bitcoins into dollars to pay taxes. So on that level, it doesn\u2019t threaten the dollar as a reserve currency, which is ultimately backed by military/law enforcement power.\u201d \u2013 Peter Thiel, Creator of Paypal That statement seems rather odd to me \u2013 and possibly to you as well \u2013 as Paypal has recently announced they integrated Bitcoin payments through one of the companies they own. In fact, one could go as far as saying that Paypal sees the same potential in Bitcoin as it sees in traditional payment methods such as bank accounts and credit or debit cards. We all know that Bitcoin will not be replacing fiat currencies in the near or distant future, but it will bring a new level of technology and insight to existing financial infrastructures. Whether or not we will see any government fully embrace that technology \u2013 and not just Bitcoin as a currency \u2013 remains to be seen at this point, but we can only hope so. Despite Paypal integrating Bitcoin through BrainTree, it has proven to be incredibly hard to find a merchant who is accepting the service. And that is the major downside of the announcement by Paypal, as it remains up to the seller to \u201cenable\u201d Bitcoin payments via Paypal, yet hardly any sellers know about this feature at this point in time. The foundation for a mutual beneficial partnership between Paypal and Bitcoin has been laid, but it will take some time until we actually see Bitcoin money flowing in to Paypal\u2019s ecosystem.", "date": "2015-03-02T21:28:02+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 2}

With the year barely getting into full swing it seems as if the Bitcoin prices and markets have raced ahead. With Bitcoin prices jumping $2 \u2013 $20 a day on some occasions it may be time for Bitcoin to, as they say it, head to the moon\u2026 Currently the Bitcoin prices stay firmly at the $270 mark which has been held for 3-4 days. This stability has also allowed for growth as the prices of Bitcoin have been inching up daily touching the upper $280\u2019s on multiple occasions. However it has been highlighted that there a multitude of reasons which have been attributed to the recent Bitcoin price rise. With many hailing Kim DotCom as the catalyst for this reaction some also believe the current Chinese involvement may have been key to the surge in prices. With many claiming China is back in the mining game, we will have to wait and see what new prospects this super power has for Bitcoin. Bitcoin prices are also forecasted to move up the scale with the current Bitcoin auction via the marshals service attracting plenty of attention. However the movement could also go the other direction as the intentions of the bidders are unknown. With some genuinely appreciating the technology others simply consider this a chance to get their hands on cheap coins. Cheap coins to dump on the market\u2026 Currently Bitcoin prices are moving in the positive direction with small but frequent jumps being seen at regular intervals. With the price starting the day at a price of $269 highs of $280 were seen earlier in the day. However after a small bout of resistance and market correction, the Bitcoin prices toppled to $273 ultimately netting some growth. Speculation With bitcoin prices edging closer and closer to the 300 mark, it may be only a matter of time before global market capitalization occurs. With many country\u2019s including China as of recently giving Bitcoin full recognition as a currency, interest and money flowing into the markets has flared.

Not only because of the Bitcoin price not hitting the US$320 mark \u2013 which is supposedly the \u201csweet spot\u201d to make cloud mining profitable once again \u2013 but also because of weird stories surrounding several Bitcoin cloud mining providers. AMHash is the latest company in that list, as they claim someone has \u201cstolen\u201d 5 petahash of Bitcoin mining hashrate. Trouble started brewing for AMHash customers once the company announced they will suspend paying out dividends to shareholders since February 28th. In fact, there had been issues with AMhash dividends ever since the beginning of February, as their \u201csupplier\u201d ASICMINER had not paid any of the owed money to AMHash. However, the matter would be resolved rather swiftly apparently, as AMHash dividends would be paid out again within 24 hours of receiving the Bitcoin payment from ASICMINER. All the missing payouts from February 8th up until the date on when that payment would be received will be sent out to shareholders without any issues. Needless to say, this has not happened yet at the time of publication. Dividends would not be the only \u201cvictim\u201d because of all this, as the trading of AMHash1 shares on Havelock has also been suspended until the dividend payouts are set to resume. This means that people who are not happy with the current situation can\u2019t even sell off their AMHash shares, as the trading market has been disabled. You can see where this is going, right? A new update was provided by the AMhash team just yesterday, where they explained how 3.546 Petahash of Bitcoin mining power has gone \u201cmissing\u201d since December 25th 2014. According to the representative, the problem came to light just two days later, and they asked friedcat \u2013 a well-known member in the Bitcoin mining community \u2013 what the deal was. According to friedcat, the mining farm where this hashpower suddenly disappeared from was undergoing some maintenance, and the missing hashrate would come back online in a few days tops. I\u2019m not sure what kind of wizardry the people at AMHash expected to see happen, but the hashrate is still not accounted for more than two months later. After some back-and-forth communication between friedcat and AMHash, we are still no step closer to finding a solution to the problem. However, some more evidence has come to light, as friedcat now allegedly claims that the missing mining hashpower has been stolen by the partner of the mining farm. Right, we didn\u2019t see that one coming, did we? With a bit of luck, we will see a solution being provided by friedcat as the plan is to deploy additional Bitcoin mining hashpower from new mining farms. Up until this point, there has been no further communication between all parties involved, and AMHash customers are left in the cold with no option to recoup some of their losses. All Signs Point Towards AMHash Being a Ponzi Needless to say, the story above does not seem to make that much sense to anyone. The biggest question customers have is why AMHash only announced this hardware gone missing two months after the facts? The company could have come clean at the end of December 2014 instead of \u201ckeeping up appearances. Definitely not a good way to earn your customers\u2019 trust. Perhaps the oddest part of this story is that AMHash has managed to pay out dividends between December 26th and February 28th. Allegedly, these dividends are coming from AMHash\u2019s own pocket, but it does beg the question whether or not this is just a way of throwing people off the idea of this company turning into yet another cloud mining ponzi scheme. Unfortunately for all parties involved, AMHash claims they can take no further action until they hear from friedcat. If you believe this story is completely true, you can rest assured that he/she will never be heard from again under that nickname. However, if the story is false, we haven\u2019t heard the last of AMHash either.

Especially in the city of New York itself, as a new Lamassu Bitcoin ATM was installed at the Old Man Hustle bar, located in Lower Manhattan. Manhattan \u2013 Quite Popular Place for Bitcoin ATM\u2019s Manhattan is proving to be a very interesting spot to have Bitcoin ATM\u2019s installed, as several of these machines can be found throughout the area. According to CoinATMRadar, no less than six Bitcoin ATM\u2019s can be found across Upper and Lower Manhattan.There also seems to be a nice competition going on between Bitcoin ATm manufacturers Lamassu and SkyHook. Perhaps the most interesting place in all of manhattan to find a Bitcoin ATM is Crispin\u2019s Restaurant in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Not just because it has its very own Bitcoin ATM, but actually because there are two different Bitcoin ATM\u2019s located at this place. And to make it even more interesting, there is one Lamassu machine and one SkyHook machine, both of which can be accessed seven days a week between 12PM and 2AM Most of you Bitcoin enthusiasts will be aware that SkyHook is a \u201ccheaper\u201d option when you are looking to purchase your very own Bitcoin ATM. On the other hand, the Lamassu Bitcoin ATM is more expensive, which doesn\u2019t necessarily provide a better user experience. Both machines at Crispin\u2019s are one-way ATM\u2019s, meaning that customers can buy Bitcoin with fiat currency without any problems. CoinATMRadar has no information on the fees associated with either device however. Over at Trattoria Inwood, which is located at 4994 Broadway, we find another SkyHook Bitcoin ATM. This device can also be accessed seven days a week, so make sure to check the opening hours here. However, this SkyHook ATM may have one of the highest fees I have seen so far, as it charges a whopping 8% commission to exchange your fiat currency to Bitcoin. Another Lamassu Bitcoin ATM can be found over at FLAT 128 \u2013 located between Waverly and Greenwich \u2013 which can also be accessed seven days a week. The Lamassu Bitcoin ATM at FLAT 128 is also a one-way device, and has a daily limit of US$1,000. Fees are equal to roughly 6%, which is a bit less steep compared to the SkyHook Bitcoin ATM in Upper Manhattan. But there is a new competitor on the block as Zen Palate \u2013 located on 3rd Avenue \u2013 hosts a Bitcoin ATM produced by General Bytes. This machine lets you buy Bitcoin in exchange for fiat currency at an unknown fee, and can be access Monday through Sunday. More details about this device can be found here. The latest addition to the list of places in Manhattan where you can find a Bitcoin ATM, is called the Old Man Hustle bar in Lower Manhattan. As is the trend of this article, the Lamassu Bitcoin ATM installed at this location is at your disposal seven days a week, and is yet another one-way machine. At this time, we have not received any official indication as to which fees are charged per transaction. What we do know is that this Lamassu Bitcoin ATM is operated by PYC, a company dedicated to bringing Bitcoin to the state of New York and beyond. According to one of their Twitter posts, the company operates Bitcoin ATM\u2019s in Manhattan, Albany, Burlington and Manchester. It will be interesting to see whether or not PYC decides to turn one or several of their Bitcoin ATM\u2019s into two-way devices in the future.

According to the BTER Twitter account, the team is planning on reopening the exchange to its full potential once again. This story draws a lot of parallels to what happened to that other major Bitcoin exchange that got hacked earlier this year, which led to Bitstamp having to rebuild their entire backend as well. 2015 Has definitely not been the year of Bitcoin exchanges so far, with multiple platforms suffering from DDoS attacks, and in some cases, even a breach of security which resulted in customer funds being lost. Two major exchanges have suffered from that same fate over the course of January and February, as both Bitstamp and BTER have lost Bitcoins due to these security breaches. In the case of BTER, over 7,000 Bitcoins were lost, which put a major damper on the mood among Bitcoin community members. Not just because of that rather large amount of coins gone missing, but also because the BTER hack came on the heels of the Bitstamp hack and the exchange opening its doors to the public once again at the end of January. According to various crypto sources, the BTER exchange had insufficient funds to repay all of the customer who have lost money. In fact, things were looking so dire that a contingency plan had been formed by BTER executives in order to sell the exchange platform if push would come to shove. Up until this point, there has been no official confirmation of this plan being executed though. The fact that it wasn\u2019t the first time the BTER exchange platform got hacked didn\u2019t help matters either. Just six months prior to the recent hack, the exchange platform had been breached by a hacker who managed to sluice away 50 million NXT \u2013 worth around US$1.6m at the time of the attack. A portion of that funds was returned to the exchange platform after successful negotiations with the hacker however. Needless to say, there seems to be something wrong with the BTER exchange platform\u2019s security, and this issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible. Getting hacked once can happen to the very best, but twice in six months is a sign on the wall to move away from BTER and look for a different exchange to satisfy your trading needs. A few hours ago, the BTER Twitter account mentioned the following: \u201cWe have decided to rebuild BTER\u2019s backend, completely solve the wallets security issue and re-enable all the tradings.\u201d It\u2019s about time their engineers start working on ways to completely solve the security issues concerning the BTER exchange platform, which is something that should have been done six months ago. Unfortunately, no official ETA was given and it remains to be seen how long the rebuilding process will take. If BTER engineers take a page from BitStamp\u2019s book, it will take about a week and a half from this announcement until the exchange is up and running again. It is important to note however that users can currently access the BTER website, but certain trading options have been disabled for the time being. This announcement also brings a lot of controversy to the table, as there is still no word on when affected customers will see their stolen coins being returned to them, either by the hacker or by BTER themselves. It looks like the exchange platform is doing everything they can to move people\u2019s attention away from the fact they can\u2019t repay their customer base at this point. Will you be using the BTER exchange platform again once it\u2019s fully operational?

One of the main features about these ATM\u2019s \u2013 which is not available at every location unfortunately \u2013 is the fact you can also sell Bitcoin in exchange for fiat currency. Warsaw, the capital city of Poland, can now be added to the list of locations with a two-way Bitcoin ATM. Bitcoinomat.pl \u2013 Building a Bitcoin ATM Network Over the course of recent years, we have seen many Bitcoin manufacturers pop up all over the world. Most of these companies are based outside of Europe, with Bitcoinomat.pl being one of the exceptions to that rule. This Polish company aims not just to create a lot of Bitcoin ATM\u2019s, but they also want to build the largest Bitcoin ATM network in Poland and beyond. One of the first steps in realizing that goal is achieved by installing Poland\u2019s first two-way Bitcoin ATM at Five Restaurant, located on Grzybowska 5 Street in Warsaw. Installation of this machine was made possible with the help of Midgar. This announcement comes just a mere three months after installing the very first Bitcoin ATM in Poland, which can be found at Bobby Burger in Warsaw. Warsaw\u2019s two-way Bitcoin ATM is a BitxATM device which allows users to both buy and sell bitcoin in exchange for fiat currency. Seeing as how this machine is a two-way ATM, we can conclude this is a BitxATM Sumo device, which is priced at 3,990 EUR [excluding VAT]. It is important to note the machine will be accessible every day between 11AM and midnight, and all transactions subject to a 5% commission. \u201cBitcoin is the digital currency of the future. At the moment, around the world, more and more companies accept payments [in Bitcoin]. [\u2026] Poland also follows this trend, and the mission of Bitcoinomat is [to set up] machines to facilitate the acquisition of the currency. With [Bitcoinomat], you do not have [to register] in an exchange, give [your personal] data, wait for the transfer [to process]. Purchases and sales [using] our machines are immediate \u2013 you only [need] a Bitcoin wallet, cash and to be an adult.\u201d \u2013 Bitcoinomat.pl One vital tool to make Bitcoin a widespread success is informing people about not just the currency, but also the advantages offered by the Bitcoin technology. Bitcoinomat.pl is aiming to educate the Polish population on Bitcoin, as well as promote the use of Bitcoin [the currency] throughout the country. In order to promote the use of Bitcoin, Bitcoinomat.pl will keep bringing more and more Bitcoin ATM\u2019s to Poland. At this point in time,it remains unclear whether or not there will be more two-way Bitcoin ATM\u2019s being installed any time soon. What we do know is that the company is looking to put additional ATM\u2019s at the best possible locations for maximum exposure. But that is not all, as Bitcoinomat.pl is also targetting business and retailers in order to push Bitcoin adoption to new heights in Poland. At this point in time, Bitcoinomat.pl offers assistance in regards to implementing Bitcoin payment solutions and corporate training sessions on Bitcoin-related topics.

Ranging from hotels and flights to electronics, SEO services and even 3D printers, the purchasing options are pretty much limitless. But every now and then, you come across the darndest niche items you can buy with Bitcoin as well. The concept of buying random items in a box is nothing new in the world of internet and e-commerce. One of the primary examples of such a random box is Lootcrate, where you get a collection of goodies regarding a certain theme delivered to your home every month. Or how about Harry\u2019s, which ships shaving supplies to your door based on your subscription schedule. But when it comes to food, these kind of deals are hard to find, especially if you are located outside the US, Canada or United Kingdom. JapanCrate is looking to change that, as this company will ship their boxes of goodies to any country in the world. Citizens of the United States will receive free shipping, while other customers pay up to US$15 for international shipping [which comes with a tracking number]. So what makes JapanCrate so special? As you can guess by its name, JapanCrate only sells goodies that are very popular in Japan. Or to be more precise, they will sell you Japanese sweets and treats on a subscription basis. If you look on Youtube for \u201cJapanese candy\u201d , you will find some of the examples that may very well be in your next JapanCrate delivery. The Japan Crate February Premium option \u2013 which costs you US$30 excluding shipping depending on your location \u2013 contains 10 different Japanese sweets, ranging from Pokemon Sparkling Apple Drink to Liquid Mixing Candy. But JapanCrate wouldn\u2019t be true to the nature of Japanese sweets if there wasn\u2019t something peculiar included in February\u2019s box, which is Kizami Dried Squid. It has to be said however that everything else included in the box looks fairly normal and standard. You can hardly go wrong with chocolate biscuits or collectible card gu, but then again again, it is coming from Japan, so you never really know. All in all, the JapanCrate boxes look pretty interesting if you are into that kind of thing, and their subscription model could prove to be an interesting value for money. Speaking of JapanCrate subscriptions, it is currently not possible to start a new subscription as the company has been overwhelmed by the success and demand of their customers. A waiting list has been opened, to which anyone can subscribe by entering your email address. For the time being, it remains unclear when subscriptions will be made available again to new customers. The reason why JapanCrate has caught our eye is because this company accepts two different payment methods : Paypal and Bitcoin. Considering their business models revolves around subscriptions \u2013 which are recurring payments \u2013 it seems safe to assume that Coinbase will be handling their Bitcoin transactions. We could not verify this at the time of publication because the website gives us the following error : Error occurred while contacting gateway : ACCESS_KEY not matched with a user.

However, sometimes a Bitcoin exchange can be hit by personal news pretty badly. It is with deep regret that we at BTCFeed report the passing of Adam Tepper, CEO of Australian Bitcoin exchange Independent Reserve. Adam Tepper was a 34-year old Bitcoin enthusiasts living in melbourne Australia. Because of his passion for Bitcoin \u2013 not just as a currency, but also the technology and how it can empower each and every one of us \u2013 he started his own Bitcoin exchange called Independent Reserve. The name is aptly chosen, as Bitcoin is independent from [part of] the current financial ecosystem. Suffering from an accident while spending some vacation time in Thailand, Mr. Tepper apparently lost control over his motorcycle yesterday evening. According to a report from the Phuket Gazette, the body of Adam Tepper was found 30 metres away from his motorcycle, with which he had hit a parked trailer in the city centre. Local authorities have confirmed that Adam Tepper died immediately following the crash. Furthermore, Mr. Tepper\u2019s mother Dianna told us that her son was not wearing a helmet during the time of the accident. Police reports also indicate that Adam Tepper hit his head against the traffic sign, with his instant death being an unavoidable consequence. \u201cMr Tepper was not wearing a helmet and struck his head on the sign \u2014 he died instantly. I believe he was moving very fast at the time of the crash, as part of the sign pole was buried a metre underground, and it was pulled out by the impact,\u201d Captain Thada Sodarak of the Chalong Police told BTCFeed. Adam Tepper was a motorcycle enthusiasts for a long time, and a member of Phuket-based Ao Chalong Yacht Club, whose members wrote a tribute message on their website stating: \u201cLong-standing and active ACYC member, Adam Tepper, was tragically killed in a motorcycle accident in the early hours of Friday 27th February. We will miss him both at the yacht club bar and out on the water.\u201d The Independent Reserve cryptocurrency exchange was originally founded in 2013, and its headquarters are located in Sydney, Australia. Adam Tepper was a well-known cryptocurrency supporter, which is part of the reason why he decide to get Independent Reserve up and running in the first place \u2013 to share his passion for Bitcoin with other like-minded people. Mr.Tepper\u2019s family is currently receiving consular assistance from The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Australia. We at BTCFeed are saddened by the news, and wish to extend our prayers to the family and friends of Adam Tepper. He will never be forgotten by the Bitcoin community.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/companies-bitcoin-not/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Companies And Bitcoin : What Not To Do", "content": "Bitcoin enthusiasts and evangelists are trying to persuade as many companies as possible to start accepting Bitcoin as a payment method for their goods and services. However, most companies are not properly educated on how Bitcoin can be beneficial to them except for financial gain. As a result, some companies are prone to make some horrible mistakes once they get involved in Bitcoin, which we will highlight below. It goes without saying that Bitcoin \u2013 just like anything that holds a monetary value \u2013 can bring out both the best and worst in people. Once your company starts working with Bitcoin in one way or another, you may very well see a tremendous amount of money flowing to your company. Greed is a basic human emotion, and your company wouldn\u2019t be the first to look at the funds coming in as your own \u201cplay money\u201d. In fact, names such as Butterfly Labs, ASIC Mining Technologies and quite a few others are synonymous with greed bringing out the worst in people. But no matter how you look at it, you are stealing from other people. Even though Bitcoin is a non-refundable currency \u2013 which is not even recognized as a currency in most countries to begin with \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t face severe repercussions once you start siphoning off funds. Considering the fact that more and more governments are actively looking at ways to both regulate and legislate the Bitcoin ecosystem, those repercussions will only get more severe. You can always try to blame the disappearance of funds on \u2018software bugs\u2019 or something similar, but that just won\u2019t fly with the everyday Bitcoin user anymore. It is in the best interests of both yourself and your company to do the honest thing. Getting rich quick is not the way to go, and especially not in the world of Bitcoin. There is nothing wrong with being hesitant towards Bitcoin, especially when it comes to the business side of things. Given the current uncertainty regarding regulation and legislation around the world, it\u2019s hard to judge whether Bitcoin will be considered an actual currency or not. And if so, does that mean your business needs to obtain a specific license in order to dell with Bitcoin payments? But there is a huge difference between being hesitant and taking up a negative stance. Most companies who are openly negative [or even hostile] towards Bitcoin try to make arguments which will hurt their own business in the end. Major credit card companies are a prime example of this, as they keep linking Bitcoin to terrorism, black market deals and whatnot. However, the same traditional payment methods we use now [cash, credit and debit cards] are the ones verified to be linked to terrorism and black market deals. Needless to say, these credit card companies are threatened by Bitcoin, as this disruptive digital currency aims to cut out intermediary companies such as Visa and Mastercard from the financial ecosystem. Instead of looking at ways to work with Bitcoin, these old-fashion institutions keep badmouthing Bitcoin and making a fool of themselves. Not the best way to present your business to be honest. Let\u2019s assume your company takes the plunge and starts accepting Bitcoin payments. You will most likely sign up with one of the major Bitcoin payment processors such as Coinbase or BitPay, as they offer you the option to convert BTC payments to fiat currency immediately. Not only does this protect your company against the Bitcoin price volatility, but this also means you will get money deposited in your bank account the next business day, instead of waiting 30 days when accepting credit card payments. Here\u2019s a twist: these Bitcoin payment processors let you convert Bitcoin transactions to fiat currency, but no one says you need to convert the entire amount. Why not keep a portion of each transaction in Bitcoin itself, instead of converting it to USD, EUR or GBP? This way, you not only show true appreciation to the Bitcoin community, but it can even get you some additional profits in the long run if the Bitcoin price goes up. Paying bills and wages as a company is not an easy task, and all of us in the Bitcoin community understand that. But once you start accepting Bitcoin payments, a company can start pushing their staff and suppliers to also accept Bitcoin payments, thus creating a whole new ecosystem for your company. Bitcoin is not just about money coming in, it\u2019s also about sharing your vision for a better world.", "date": "2015-03-01T20:36:34+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 1}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/airlines-benefit-accepting-bitcoin/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Why Airlines Would Benefit From Accepting Bitcoin", "content": "Assuming you haven\u2019t been living under a rock this past week, you will most certainly have heard the news of UATP \u2013 a payment network for most of the world\u2019s airlines \u2013 integrating Bitcoin as a payment option. Before everyone gets their hopes up, you have to keep in mind that it is still up to the airlines themselves whether or not they will actually use the Bitcoin option in the future, similar to how Paypal\u2019s Braintree works. It has to be said though, the partnership between UATP and Bitnet \u2013 a payment processing platform for Bitcoin transactions \u2013 is a rather strategic one. Considering how UATP merchants provide services to roughly 95% of airlines around the world, it could prove to be an interesting market for Bitcoin integration assuming the airlines decide to use the option. Even though popular travel website Expedia is already accepting Bitcoin payments since 2014, it was only a matter of time until more people started to take notice. And with airlines such as Lufthansa and British Airways making use of UATP to process payments, we can only hope that at least one of these major airlines starts accepting Bitcoin in the near future. Bitcoin provides both the sender and the recipient with low to non-existent transaction fees, which is enough of a reason in its own right to at least consider accepting bitcoin payments. Especially when taking into account how credit cards, paypal and even bank transfers are the subject of fraudulent transactions on a regular basis, Bitcoin is a worthy alternative \u2013 if not better than all traditional payment methods in existence today. The airline industry could prove to be an untapped market for Bitcoin, as most airlines are doing everything they possibly can to lower overhead and expenses. Whether they have to route flights differently, or even fire 10% of their personnel, there always seem to be far too many costs involved. Bitcoin could easily help to reduce costs by a significant margin. A little known fact is how little profit the airline industry makes a year. Even if it\u2019s a pretty busy year, global profit margins will hardly exceed the 1.5% rate, which is next to nothing from a business point of view. On top of that, airlines have to deal with international customers all the time, which also means that foreign currency needs to be exchanges \u2013 which in turn also adds even more costs. Bitcoin could solve this issue as well, as the currency can be used globally without losing any of its value by sending it to a person in a different country. Not only will this remove the hassle of dealing in different currencies, but it also removes any costs associated with these currency exchanges. Overall, this would benefit both the airline companies and their customers, making it a win-win situation. As much as we all would love to pay for our flights with Bitcoin, there is one major downside to this option as well. Bitnet, like most Bitcoin payment processors, lets retailers convert BTC payments to fiat currency immediately. It is safe to assume that nearly every airline accepting Bitcoin payments would choose to do so, dumping a ton of BTC on the open market on a daily basis. While this process would create a nice flow of liquidity for Bitcoin exchanges, it can also heavily impact the BTC price in a negative way, as there is an excess of Bitcoin to be sold. However, as people can book their flights with Bitcoin [cheaper than with conventional payment methods] the demand for Bitcoin could increase, and potentially even nullify the amount of Bitcoin being dumped. Even though the UATP news is a major step forward for the branding of Bitcoin, there is no reason to get all excited about this announcement until one of the major airlines actually starts using the payment option.

But did you know that Ukraine also has its very own Bitcoin exchange, called BTC-Trade UA? A lot of people would associate Ukraine with a country that is behind the rest of Europe when it comes to technology and infrastructure. While this may be true up to a certain degree, it is safe to assume there are more people in Ukraine who have heard of Bitcoin compared to some countries in the Western world [such as Belgium for example..]. BTC-Trade UA is an interesting exchange, as it is the easiest and most convenient way to buy and sell Bitcoin in Ukraine. By offering a wide range of supported digital currencies, low trading fees and allowing the use of credit cards to purchase Bitcoin make BTC-Trade UA an exchange platform to keep an eye on in 2015. Account registration takes less than five minutes, according to the website. In order to buy or sell Bitcoins in exchange for fiat currency, users will be required to verify their identity by submitting a scan of their ID/passport and providing a recent utility bill to verify their address. The BTC-Trade UA FAQ does not mention how the verification process usually takes however. Transactions on the BTC-Trade UA platform are executed immediately, but can take up to 24 hours to confirm, which is far more an exception that a regularity. In order to avoid fraudulent transactions \u2013 for buying and selling Bitcoins that is \u2013 users will need to confirm the transaction manually. As far as we can tell, BTC-Trade UA offers no two-factor authentication to protect your user account. In regards to fees, every transaction executed on the BTC-Trade UA platform is subject to a 0.1% fee. However, additional fees incur when making a digital currency deposit. At this point in time, four different digital currencies are supported : Bitcoin, Litecoin, Novacoin and Dogecoin. Withdrawals are also subject to certain fees, which vary depending on your preferred payment method. One of the things that sets BTC-Trade UA apart from other exchanges in Europe is their partnership program. To make this partnership program even more special, the team behind the Bitcoin exchange decided to create three different tiers, each of which offers you a different reward. Do keep in mind this partnership program will be revised in a few weeks from now. Tier 1 : Exchange fees are lowered to 0.05%. You will need to refer a new user to BTC-Trade UA who completes at least one trade during their first month, and you have to complete 15 transactions in that same month yourself. Furthermore, the total fiat value of last month\u2019s transactions needs to be 30,000 Hryvnia [or more]. Tier 2 : You will receive 50% of the provision costs charged to the users you referred to the platform. In order to qualify for this bonus , you will need to refer at least two people who completed a minimum of one successful trade on BTC-Trade UA in their first month, as well as meet all Tier 1 requirements. Tier 3 : The required number of network confirmations for digital currencies will be lowered, once you meet all of the prerequisites for Tier 1 and 2, as well as complete at least 30 transactions in one month. According to this page on the BTC-Trade UA website, the Bitcoin exchange recently became the victim of a successful hack. However, the exchange operators managed to restore user balances up to a certain point by purchasing Bitcoins with money out of their own pockets, and using those to return money to affected users. It remains to be seen whether or not BTC-Trade UA will be able to make a splash in the Ukrainian market, as the country is heavily relying on WebMoney to process online payments. However, it is good to see the country having its very own Bitcoin exchange, and we wish BTC-Trade UA all the best.

But while those household names are making the [mainstream] media headlines, a ton of smaller retailers also started accepting Bitcoin payments over the past year. Even though Bitcoin is still very risky in the general public\u2019s eye, it also provides an additional revenue stream for both small and big retailers. The increased Bitcoin adoption by merchants can be attributed to several reasons. First of all, there are a lot of retailers who only have an online presence, and most of them are barely making enough sales to cover the fees they have to pay to credit card transaction processors. Not to mention the fees that come with each transaction as well, and the wait time until they see money appearing in their bank account \u2013 which can take up to 30 days. Bitcoin provides an excellent additional payment option for these retailers, as there are low to zero transaction costs per transaction. Furthermore, Bitcoin payments are processed relatively fast and as a merchant, you have the option to convert each Bitcoin payment to your local currency through a payment processor such as BitPay or CoinBase. Local currency payments usually take place the next business days, which is far more favorable compared to more traditional alternatives. As an added bonus, by accepting Bitcoin as a payment method, merchants may very well attract a new customer base which otherwise would have been out of reach. When a new merchant opens their online business and accepts traditional payment methods, you won\u2019t get noticed any time soon. But when you announce that you accept Bitcoin payments as well, it becomes a whole different ballgame. And why wouldn\u2019t you integrate Bitcoin payments on your website to begin with? There is virtually no risk in doing so, it is more likely to attract new customers and media attention, and it all it takes is editing a few lines of code on your website. There simply is no valid reason not to accept digital currency payments as an online merchant, regardless of whether you\u2019re a small or major company. Even if you are not keen on using a Bitcoin-only payment processor such as BitPay or CoinBase, there are other alternatives available. Most recently, Stripe announced the integration of Bitcoin payments to their existing range of services, which lets any retailer with a US bank account to accept bitcoin payments. With customers from over 60 countries being able to pay with Bitcoin through Stripe, this platform could prove to be an interesting alternative for merchants. In the grand scheme of finance, Bitcoin is still in its infantile stage at this point in time. Despite seeing a great rate of adoption and awareness, the technology behind Bitcoin can be perceived as being ahead of its time. Most people simply aren\u2019t looking for the solution Bitcoin provides to the current financial ecosystem, as the general public doesn\u2019t even recognize there is a problem that needs solving. The recent issues and drama surrounding Bitcoin \u2013 exchanges being hacked, ponzi schemes and the likes \u2013 are not doing the digital currency any favors. However, they are also a sign that there are a lot of people out there recognizing the potential \u2013 and equally important, the value \u2013 of Bitcoin and the technology behind it.

Depending on where you live in the world, the answer to this questions can be either very simple or very complex. BitPay is looking to change that, as they have partnered with Atlanta-based PeachDish. The concept of ordering food online is nothing new these days, as plenty of people are already using services such as GrubHub, Takeaway.com, Just-Eat and Pizza.be. After all, there is nothing easier than ordering food you crave online, pay it online and have it delivered to your front door in less than an hour. What could possibly make this scenario even better? As great as it may sound to order have food delivered to your home on a regular basis, and in some cases even pay it with Bitcoin, it\u2019s not exactly the most healthy solution. But there are alternatives out there who will deliver you the goods you need to create a more \u201ctraditional\u201d meal, in the form of a meal-kit service. PeachDish \u2013 located in Atlanta, Georgia \u2013 is one of those companies who will deliver everything you need to create a gourmet meal at home. A new menu is available on the website every week, and you can simply select which dish(es) you like. And the best part is : they accept Bitcoin and ship anywhere within the continental United States to boot. Every gourmet-meal-at-home kit contains fresh ingredients with instructions and recipes to make four decent-sized meals with. The instructions and recipes are put together by professional chefs, and are influenced by both the region and season. Needless to say, these meal kits are far healthier compared to takeaway/fastfood options, and now that PeachDish also accepts Bitcoin, there is no reason not to give them a try. Whether you are a great chef at home or one of the world\u2019s most terrible cooks, the recipes and ingredients provided by PeachDish are simple enough to follow for anyone. It is also very important to note that all of the included ingredients are fresh, and not coming out of tin cans. According to this blog post on BitPay\u2019s website, the meals are quite delicious. Let\u2019s be honest for a minute here , no one likes to stand in line for more than 10 minutes, and especially not when it comes to such a mundane task as grocery shopping. But on the other hand, you need to find a way of maintaining a balance between fat food and fresh ingredients. PeachDish could be that solution for you, or maybe it isn\u2019t, but you\u2019ll never know until you give it a try. For those of you who are going to take the plunge in ordering a PeachDish meal-it, make sure to use the offer code \u201cbtcpeach\u201d at checkout to receive a US$7 discount on your first order when paying in Bitcoin.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/btc-flow-bitcoin-faucet-ponzi-scheme/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "BTC-Flow : The Bitcoin Faucet Ponzi Scheme", "content": "When it comes to Bitcoin and digital currency \u2013 similar to more traditional fiat currency for that matter \u2013 one of the main concerns is the potential to get scammed by a service or person. As we have seen ever since Bitcoin\u2019s inception, these threats are very real and can sometimes even lead to life threatening situations. Things are getting worse when so-called Bitcoin \u201cfaucets\u201d, which give users a small amount of Bitcoin in exchange for completing a task, turn out to be a ponzi scheme. Bitcoin faucets are a great way to get novice users acquainted with this disruptive digital currency, without them having to invest any of their money just yet. Usually it is sufficient to enter your Bitcoin wallet address, click a button, and you have earned a few Satoshis. Not that much value, but then again, you have to do nearly nothing in return, so it balances out. Over the past few years, many Bitcoin faucets have come and gone, bringing more attention to Bitcoin than ever before. However, most people seem to forget these faucets also require funding in order to operate. As in, someone is giving away [chunks of] Bitcoins for free, and they get next to nothing in return, except a lot of website traffic. Although, that statement is not entirely true either; as faucet operators can use the increase in web traffic to attract advertisers who will pay them a fee to host an advertisement. At least, that\u2019s how most Bitcoin faucets operate and make money. Some have proven to be more successful than other, but it\u2019s a very competitive space these days. BTC-Flow, a recently launched Bitcoin faucet, seemed to be offered something different entirely. users were earning money by simply entering a Bitcoin address, and earnings would trickle in at regular intervals automatically. As of this writing, users would be earning 150 Satoshi per minute, or 0.00216 Bitcoin per day from doing absolutely nothing except transferring earnings to the \u201cwallet\u201d held by BTC-Flow before cashing it out. But that was not all, as BTC-Flow users also had the option to upgrade their account. In doing so, users would be entitled to more earnings per minute, which would also mean a bigger revenue of passive income on a daily basis. And BTC-Flow offered this upgrade quite cheap, at the price of just 0.05 Bitcoin. Quick calculations told us users would get their investment back in about a week, so it seemed to be a no-brainer. Undoubtedly, many people fell for this type of ponzi scheme as they wanted to maximize their earning potential from day one. Other BTC-Flow users took the better approach by collecting their \u201cfree\u201d earnings and using those to upgrade their membership level. Even though this took longer compared to coughing up the investment on day one, at least you were not investing money you couldn\u2019t afford to lose. As everyone expected however, BTC-Flow has stopped working a few days ago, as the website remains offline for the time being. Such a ponzi scheme is not sustainable for longer periods of time, especially as more and more users start collecting their \u201cfree\u201d earnings in order to upgrade their membership level, and no new funds are trickling in. As always, there is one golden rule : never invest in a program or service that seems too good to be true.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoinz-usa-announces-new-bitcoin-cold-storage-solution/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Bitcoinz USA Announces New Bitcoin Cold Storage Solution", "content": "Bitcoin security remains a hot topic of debate among enthusiasts, developers and digital currency-related service operators. As we have seen so far in 2015, there is still lots of room to improve, and a lot of people are really worried about keeping their Bitcoins safe. Cold storage solutions are popping up left and right these days, but which one is actually the best out there? Maybe vault 51 can offer us something we haven\u2019t seen yet in the world of Bitcoin. The announcement regarding Vault 51 was originally made by Bitcoinz USA, which is a subsidiary company of Bayside Corp. For those of you who are unaware of what cold storage really means, this technology allows Bitcoin users to keep their coins in a wallet that is not connected to the internet, keeping it relatively safe from harm. While this offline Bitcoin wallet solution sounds interesting right now, it is just the first step of many in order to make Vault 51 a global presence in the world of Bitcoin. Bayside Corp. has also announced that the Vault 51 website will be multilingual in order to service a broader audience. Supporting languages \u2013 other than English \u2013 include French, German and Italian. As you can judge from those languages, the main focus will be on European customers for the time being. However, by supporting these additional languages, Vault 51 will be made available in twice as many countries as before. Up until the announcement was made about the global expansion, Vault 51 was only available to customers in the US, Canada and United Kingdom. Bayside Corp. acknowledges the need to expand their business to a broader scale, as there are over 100,000 retailers around the world accepting Bitcoin payments. As the Bitcoin ecosystem is growing at an accelerated pace over the past few years, and adoption seems to be thriving all across the globe, the international launch of Vault 51 comes at a very opportune time. Especially given the recent hacks of exchanges and other digital currency-related services, fear of losing coins among the general Bitcoin population could lead to Vault 51 becoming a household brand in the next few months. By using an offline Bitcoin wallet, customers can rest assured their deposit into this wallet is protected at all times. Up to a certain point, the same can be said about online wallets, but they do pose a biggersecurity risk in general. As these wallets are always connected to the internet, a hacker or thief could gain access to this Bitcoin wallet far more easier compared to an offline Bitcoin wallet. However, you have to keep in mind that even offline Bitcoin wallet will need to connect to the internet at some point in order to broadcast the transaction to the blockchain. Considering this only has to be done every so often, it is far more secure compared to an online wallet because it will only be connected to the internet for a very short period of time. Note from the author : while this is a very simplistic explanation of the difference between these types of wallets, you can easily get the idea of why an offline Bitcoin wallet offers additional security compared to a traditional online Bitcoin wallet. Vault 51 will also try to establish an online presence in the form of both a Facebook and Google+ page. Social media has proven to be a great tool in order to stay in touch with your customer base, and it\u2019s also a great way to inform everyone about updates and announcements. Plus, social media is invaluable when it comes to building your brand name as well. Bayside Corp. has also announced one additional vault 51 feature which will will be made available later this year. Customers living in Switzerland will be able to sell their Bitcoins which are stored in the offline Bitcoin wallet. At this point in time, it remains unclear whether or not this service will be made available to other countries in the future.

This move was seen by many as a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d from the higher-ups in the financial sector to Bitcoin enthusiasts worldwide. Just a few hours, another major story was announced, which once again shook the foundations of the current financial ecosystem. Ever since people started realizing Bitcoin is a valuable commodity, there have been trading platforms. Over the course of more recent years, these platforms have evolved, added new features and also branched out to the trading of derivatives. A new derivative-trading platform for Bitcoin is coming, which will be created by former Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, Morgan Stanley and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale bankers. Not the names you would expect to build a trading platform for Bitcoin users, but this does give Bitcoin another \u201cvote of confidence\u201d from the financial world. This brokerage platform-to-be will specialize in futures and options which are tied to the Bitcoin price. Furthermore, both businesses and investors will be able to hedge their digital currency portfolio. It should come as no surprise that most people are still attracted to Bitcoin because of its price volatility, as that is where the most money is to be made in both the short and long term. None of these former bankers care about the technology behind Bitcoin, or what can be done to further integrate the blockchain into everyday society. All they want to do is make even more money. And there is nothing wrong with that, as we are all in it for personal gain in one way or another. Most of us want to see a financial gain, while others want to gain a \u201cstatus\u201d in the Bitcoin world because of their achievements. But a new derivative-trading platform for Bitcoin may attract a new crowd to our beloved digital currency, even if it is for the wrong reason. However, not every aspect about this platform is as black and white as I am portraying. Because businesses can hedge their digital currency platform, it may convince more merchants to hold [a portion of] each Bitcoin transaction in Bitcoin value, instead of immediately converting it to their local fiat currency. Assuming at least some merchants can be swayed to do so, it would be another notch in Bitcoin\u2019s belt. One could even go as far as stating that derivative trading for Bitcoin will influence the bitcoin price volatility in a positive manner \u2013 reduce it drastically. Should this be the case, we may see more and more merchants and investors flocking to the Bitcoin space, which will push adoption and awareness to new levels, and create a new virtuous cycle in its own right. Regardless of whether you think this new platform will be good or bad for Bitcoin, the fact remains that these former bankers are showing a great interest in this disruptive digital currency. And what Bitcoin really needs most right now \u2013 next to properly educating people about it \u2013 is some good press and positive media coverage.

It was announced earlier this month that UATP will be teaming up with Bitnet to create the unique service as there are not many travel options that take Bitcoin users into consideration. It is also a quite large service as it covers most of the main airlines available and should allow easy and safe flights all paid for in Bitcoin. It will cover most brands and will work with other travel agencies in order to revolutionise travel. This is against traditional methods of payment such as credit card, bank transfers and other fiat options. However it is still under development and it is not certain whether they will incorporate all the needs of the average consumer and how it will be arranged to send large required quantities of Bitcoin over. There is also the problem of the price changes which means if someone sent Bitcoin and the price went down before the service received it the money would be lost and they would have to pay more. The idea behind it is a fascinating one as it is very rarely tried and even rarer a success. It is not also sure whether the airline sites will add an option to pay with Bitcoin on their site as it would require many altercations and a much harder to accomplish rather than just sticking to fiat. However the Bitcoin option also has a risky option as it means they would have to spend a lot of time to create the new service. It could add a lot of customers on flights as many do already use the cryptocurrency and the option could mean a boom in air travel. It depends on how many will use the service and how much they may have to pay. Air Baltic already uses the Bitcoin advantage and allows easy and safe flight payments. There are already many other airlines that are looking into Bitcoin as an easy and safe way for transactions. Cryptocurrency is deemed reliable as it is very secure and has easy transactions and has a little to no fee for transferring Bitcoin. This could revolutionize countries such as Africa where majority of the population is illiterate and do not have bank accounts. Bitcoin is very volatile which means if they store Bitcoin and if the price falls they could lose a lot of their profit. It makes life quite easy for cabin crews as they won\u2019t have to collect multiple currencies and have to make sure that they have received enough. It is not confirmed that the service will be up and running in all the airlines but it is highly likely as the positives outweigh the negatives. Hopefully, in the near future, many airlines will start accepting Bitcoin and will create a boom in the airline industry and mean that many more Bitcoin-based services will be created and hopefully increase the price of Bitcoin.", "date": "2015-02-26T22:16:10+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 26}

However, doing exactly that is not as easy as one might think, as the Chinese government is not too keen on financial solutions that come from outside of the country. Bitcoin has made an impact in China as it is seeing tremendous volume across Chinese exchanges, and the derivative based Bitcoin trading platform CoinArch has expanded their business in that direction as well. Expanding one\u2019s business to China is not as straightforward as you might think, simply because of the aforementioned reason. However, once your platform starts getting a lot of interest from potential Chinese customers, the story changes dramatically, and because of that increased interest from the Chinese community, CoinArch CEO Jeremy Glaros decided to try and make a splash in the Chinese market. CoinArch is a Singapore-based company, and their online trading platform brings some innovative trading options to the world of Bitcoin and digital currency. With a combined 25 years of experience in the world of finance and trading, the CoinArch team has managed to combine industry leading products with the power of Bitcoin, one of the most disruptive threats to the current financial ecosystem as we know it. One of the main reasons for CoinArch\u2019s overwhelming success ever since the company\u2019s inception can be attributed to their wide suite of available tools, which are tailored to the needs of both experienced traders and Bitcoin enthusiasts alike. Needless to say, combining both worlds is not an easy task, but CoinArch apparently managed to pull it off. However, offering a useful service that is user friendly is only part of the job, as the CoinArch team has to keep adding new features over time. In doing so, the company has managed to score several \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d, such as their reverse convertible investment product for Bitcoin, called CoinArch Maximizer. Regardless of what the fiat markets decide to do \u2013 rise, decline or remain flat -, CoinArch\u2019s products allow for their users to profit in every scenario. Up to 10x leverage can be achieved in both rising and falling fiat markets by using CoinArch Booster. The aforementioned CoinArch Maximizer is a proven success during flat periods in the fiat markets, and users can either earn a high rate of interest or purchase bitcoin at a discounted price.

At this point in time, there are 51 participating locations, and more get added on a regular basis. Reaching the milestone of 50 merchants was a cause for major celebration among Bitcoin enthusiasts in Arnhem and the rest of the country. No one expected this much of a success at such an early stage in the project, but a bit of good will, a lot of hard work and sheer determination are already paying dividends. And the party has only just begun. Earlier this week, Chilax \u2013 a place where you can get relaxing massages among other things \u2013 joined the list of merchants in Arnhem who accept Bitcoin as a payment method. Judith Hulnink, who owns and runs Chilax, was in attendance during the Media Villa presentation, which focused on the people behind the Arnhem Bitcoincity initiative. Even though Ms. Hulnink was already aware of Bitcoin and the huge community supporting this disruptive digital currency, she wasn\u2019t convinced about its potential for her own business just yet. However, after that Media Villa presentation, she decided to take the plunge and started accepting Bitcoin payments for services rendered. After all, why not invest in your own health and relaxation with Bitcoin? Pressure point massages are the focal point for Chilax\u2019s services. Don\u2019t be mistaken in assuming Chilax is just another massage parlor, as the company focuses on helping business in need. In saying so, we mean that Chilax helps business to counter absenteeism, and also helps with stimulating people\u2019s physiological attitude at work. As most of you will know, we take on the oddest positions while sitting or standing at work, most of which are far from healthy for your body. Furthermore, Chilax also specializes in Facial Rejuvenation (also known as cosmetic Acupuncture), which revolves around making people look 5-15 years younger than they actually are. Facial rejuvenation is Mother Earth\u2019s natural counter for facelifts and botox, and helps people to find their inner balance as they experience some \u201cquality me-time\u201d.

Jos Zwaan \u2013 a massage therapist in the city of Arnhem \u2013 decided to accept Bitcoin as a payment method a while ago.

Quadriga CX, a Bitcoin trading platform, could be an interesting contender for the position of Canada\u2019s new leading Bitcoin exchange. Canada is a country where Bitcoin awareness and adoption are really thriving, yet it is also hard to find proper Bitcoin platforms due to regulatory reasons. QuadrigaCX has been around since 2014, yet hardly anyone has ever heard of this Bitcoin trading platform.

Such a growth rate has an additional benefit to customers, as they can buy and sell Bitcoin at the best rates at any time.

Located and registered in Vancouver, British Columbia, the company gladly welcomes anyone who wants to stop by their offices. Do keep in mind you will need to make an appointment first though.

Despite all of that, SWCPoker was announced little over 24 hours, which will try and fill the void that was left behind due to SWC closing up shop. But there is even more positive news, as Bitcoin and digital currencies seem to be experiencing a very large growth in online gambling on a global scale. When we look at websites from established brands in the online gambling space, there are very few Bitcoin-oriented platforms available right now. However, we are seeing an emerging trend of existing sites enabling digital currency payments next to more traditional payment methods such as debit or credit cards, or even Paypal in some cases. Depending on what you want to find in your quest for Bitcoin online gambling, it looks like casinos are most prone to start accepting this disruptive digital currency as a payment method. In second place, there are the sport books platforms, which also see the added value of accepting Bitcoin [and sometimes other digital currencies] in order to attract more customers. As the list of platforms for your Bitcoin-related online gambling needs grows larger and larger, it becomes more difficult to determine which site suits you best. On one hand, you have several gambling sites which \u2013 besides their games \u2013 also offer the latest news in regards to both gambling and Bitcoin [or other digital currencies accepted by the platform]. But there are some other factors to keep in mind as well. Seeing how Bitcoin users are becoming a high value target for hackers and hoodlums \u2013 both online and offline \u2013 online gambling platforms need to provide users with top notch security in order to keep funds safe. An online gambling website that offers two-factor authentication would be a preferable choice in this regard. Provably is a term we come across on nearly every online gambling website these days, but don\u2019t be mistaken in thinking that, just because the website claims to be provably fair, it actually is the case. As we have seen with the popular dice game website 999Dice, they cleverly hid the provably fair hash from users in order to cover up their massive house edge. One of the main reasons why not every major online gambling website is jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon has to be attributed to the regulatory uncertainty in most countries. There is no fixed regulatory stance towards Bitcoin in most countries, and as this situation can change at any given moment, most business prefer to \u201cwait and see\u201d what happens with Bitcoin and digital currency. The United States host most of the online gambling websites in the world, and this is where the fragmented regulation on Bitcoin proves to be a hassle. Certain states do not require online gambling website operators to hold a specific license, others do and some are still uncertain about whether you will need one or not. As long as there is no country-wide consensus regarding Bitcoin regulation,, the number of businesses accepting Bitcoin for online gambling will be relatively small for the time being. Outside of the United States, we see a very similar story. Most countries do not treat Bitcoin as a currency (yet), and have no regulation in place right now. But that does not prevent certain countries from forbidding all Bitcoin-related activity. But on the bright side, some countries openly state they will not get involved with digital currency, yet they leave citizens the choice whether or not they want to start using these currencies. Regardless of how you look at it, Bitcoin and online gambling seem to be a match made in heaven. Analysts expect to see continuous growth in this market, and we at BTCFeed will be keeping an eye on this trend.", "date": "2015-02-22T20:46:26+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 22}

As you would come to expect from a currency, similar to what we see in the current financial world, there are plenty of things to do with it. However, not everyone has access to a currency, and sometimes you will try to look for a loan. This is no different in the world of Bitcoin, and BTCJam is one of the largest platforms in that sector. Similar to traditional investment programs, BTCJam lets users invest their Bitcoin in order to gain an interest percentage on their deposit. By doing so, users protect themselves from Bitcoin price volatility, participate in peer-to-peer lending with a credit scoring, and are secure from any malicious entities trying to steal their digital wealth. Don\u2019t be mistaken in thinking that your Bitcoin will be invested in some of dodgy penny stock, as your funds will be used to help other parties obtain a loan. Thanks to BTCJam\u2019s Global Credit Score, risks for each borrower and every loan are carefully weighed before anything will happen with your funds. Do keep in mind that none of these schemes is 100% waterproof, although BTCJam\u2019s repayment rate of roughly 90% is one of the most solid ones in the business. In order to manage your investment, the golden rule of not putting all of your eggs in one basket applies here as well. Diversifying your portfolio across multiple loans reduces the damage done in case a repayment would not take place. But there is another rule of thumb to keep in mind : do your own research before fulfilling another user\u2019s loan request. A service such as the one offered by BTCJam would not be as big as it is today without community involvement. Have no fear, as you do not need any coding skills to be an active BTCJam community member. Rating your borrowers \u2013 a small task which is optional \u2013 can go a long way for both yourself and other like-minded investors. Borrowers who want to make sure of BTCJam\u2019s services are advised to verify their account before they are given the tools to create a loan request. Plus, verifying your account makes you eligible for lower interest rates and a higher chance of getting your listing funded by an investor. Combine that with the wide range of loan parameters to choose from, and you can see why this platform has become so popular in the Bitcoin sphere. As is the case with any self-respecting Bitcoin business, continuous development is a key element in becoming successful. BTCJam acknowledges that by adding new features and tools at regular intervals. One of such features is called \u201cHide Invested\u201d, which has been announced earlier today in their blog post. A suggestion was made by one of their community members about having a feature that would \u201chide\u201d loans that person has not already invested in. Due to some hard work by the BTCJam engineers, who should be applauded for their hard work, the \u201cHide Invested\u201d feature was born, which effectively hides any loans you have already invested in. It just takes a small checkmark to activate, and you are all set.

Even though there has been one such isolated incident in the past few months, it looks like a new \u201cBitcoin crime wave\u201d is hitting the streets of New York, after a NY firefighter got mugged and stabbed over his digital currency. Bitcoin has always had a bit of a tarnished reputation since the whole debacle with Silk Road, and then later on with Mt. Gox. Both of these black pages in Bitcoin\u2019s history books turned into hefty feeding frenzies for mainstream media to warn people of this digital currency, and \u201cadvise\u201d everyday users not to get involved with Bitcoin or other currencies that aren\u2019t controlled by a government. However, now that more and more people find themselves physically threatened for owning Bitcoins, things have definitely taken a drastic turn for the worst. New York City firefighter Dwayne Richards is a recent victim of a violent robbin, which left Mr. Richards with several stab wounds to the body. The life of a firefighter is already tough enough it is, and these people deserve a lot more respect than they are getting. Unidentified assailants decided to pick Mr. Richards as a high-value target, simply because he owns several Bitcoins. In fact, the thugs actually made an appointment with Dwayne Richards in order to buy the Bitcoins from him in a peer-to-peer in-person exchange. Once he met up with these assailants in Brooklyn however, it quickly became clear they were never going to pay him for his digital currency, but just rob and stab the man. This is not the first time we see Bitcoin being associated with physical violence or death threats. Ranging from clobbering someone to death with a hammer to putting a gun to a Bitcoin user\u2019s head, or even death threats are no longer a strange occurrence in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Just like with fiat currency, Bitcoin is being looked at by hoodlums to quickly make a bit of money. While none of us wish to see the Bitcoin space turn into a modern version of the Wild West, actions like these will undoubtedly give the mainstream media outlets another chance to completely trash and bash Bitcoin. Unfortunately, there is not much that can be done at this point, except for taking precautions when conducting a Bitcoin trade in-person.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/fern-creek-united-methodist-church-now-accepting-bitcoin-donations/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Fern Creek United Methodist Church Now Accepting Bitcoin Donations", "content": "Bitcoin and good causes seem to go hand in hand as of late, which is in part thanks to major charitable organizations such as the American Red Cross and The Water Project openly accepting Bitcoin donations. And let\u2019s not forget the efforts by BitGive either, as they are doing some remarkable work as of late. But who would\u2019ve thought a Methodist Church would start accepting Bitcoin as a form of donations on their own accord? Louisville, Kentucky will never be the same again as of today. The Fern Creek United Methodist Church has decided to start accepting donations in the form of Bitcoin on their website, in what seems to be a rather radical move. Don\u2019t expect to see a Bitcoin ATm near the holy water just yet though, but the option is available on the website right now. In fact, most people will be quite surprised about the due diligence put into accepting Bitcoin donations by the Fern Creek United Methodist Church. Instead of just putting up a Bitcoin wallet address on the website for people to send donations to, they offer interested parties three different options to make a contribution. Bitcoin enthusiasts have to admire the \u201cBitcoin Accepted Here\u201d logo, which can be found on both the Fern Creek United Methodist Church website\u2019s main page, as well as on the Bitcoin donation page. It would be interesting to see the physical church building make a mention of Bitcoin being accepted as well in the future. On the Bitcoin donation page, you will find some information about how a Bitcoin donation may provide tax advantages over other contribution methods. However the Fern Creek United methodist Church does warn about the regulations being unclear and how they can be changed at any time. It is always best to contact your tax advisor to verify whether or not you would receive a tax advantage from making a Bitcoin contribution. When you wish to make a contribution to the Fern Creek United Methodist Church, there are three different options at your disposal. Option one lets you make a one-time donation which will be acknowledged on the donator\u2019s regular FCUMC Giving Statement. This type of donations can make you eligible for a tax advantage. Option two lets you send an anonymous one-time donation , which can be done by scanning the QR code on the Bitcoin donations webpage. Do keep in mind that using the anonymous donation option, the donation itself can not be acknowledged for tax deductibility or any other purposes. However, the donation will be visible on the Bitcoin blockchain of course. Last but not least, you also have the option to set up a recurring Bitcoin donation plan, which will be billed every week/month/quarter. To use this option, you will need a CoinBase account, as recurring payments are not natively supported by the Bitcoin protocol. Fern Creek United Methodist Church even offers their referral link for you to create a CoinBase account, as you will receive US$1 worth of free Bitcoin once you have verified the account. Overall, the FCUMC has done a tremendous job in setting up the Bitcoin donations webpage, especially considering they offer three different choices. Furthermore, they also looked into providing people with some basic information regarding a tax advantage, as well as setting up an account with CoinBase to support recurring Bitcoin donations.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/conducting-bitcoin-business-canada-becomes-far-less-appealing/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Conducting Bitcoin Business In Canada Becomes Far Less Appealing", "content": "Canada seems to be far less attractive for Bitcoin users over the past few days, as nothing but bad news has been coming from that corner of the world. Not only has CaVirtex \u2013 one of the country\u2019s biggest Bitcoin exchanges \u2013 announced they have been potentially breached, but Vermont\u2019s only Bitcoin ATM will be shut down due to regulatory issues as well. The news about CaVirtex shutting down immediately was announced yesterday evening, as the company made it clear they will cease carrying on as an active Bitcoin business. Furthermore, CaVirtex operations will be winding down in the very near future, and no new deposits on the platform are accepted as of yesterday. Trading Bitcoin with existing funds is still available on the CaVirtex platform until March 20th of 2015, and all withdrawal requests before March 25th will be honored. Once that date has passed, no more withdrawals will be processed. However, should you find yourself among one of the few customers still holding funds in their balance after March 25th, there will be some form of communication between CaVirtex and yourself to resolve the matter. Even though CaVirtex has successfully maintained 100% of their reserves and is solvent without a shadow of a doubt, there is a serious reason for concern. On February 15th, discrepancies were found in regards to the possible compromisation of an older version of the database, which also includes 2FA secrets and hashed passwords. No identification documents are located in the database in question though. While the decision to shut down all Bitcoin operations immediately may seem a bit harsh, CaVirtex feels that the damage to their reputation caused by a potential compromise justifies their decision. As we have seen in the past, once an exchange gets breached, it never gets back to that same level of trust as it managed to establish before. The most important part is that none of the CaVirtex users lost any of their funds, and as a result, CaVirtex can easily and safely return all funds to their rightful owners. It has to be said however that account credentials are most likely compromised, and all CaVirtex users are advised to change their account password immediately. Furthermore, all users need to fill in their Bitcoin and/or Litecoin withdrawal addresses in their user preferences, as all previous data stored in these fields has been cleared for security purposes. Users\u2019 Bitcoin and Litecoin balances will be sent to their respective addresses once withdrawals are enabled once again. CAD Withdrawals have not been halted during all of this. Operating a Bitcoin ATM has be quite lucrative, especially when it is the only device in an entire state or country. Unfortunately, this also makes you a target for state officials, as the owners of Vermont\u2019s only Bitcoin ATM have noticed. Apparently, they have received a letter from the Department of Financial Regulation of Vermont, stating how they could be facing penalties for operating without a proper money transmitter license. The letter was sent to both Emilio Pagan-Yourno \u2013 Executive of PYC \u2013 and Daniel Riley \u2013 President of Blu-Bin \u2013 via certified mail. In the letter, the Department of Financial Regulation of Vermont explains how the operation of a Bitcoin kiosk requires a license under Vermont Money Services Act, 8 VSA Chapter 79. PYC has to obtain a money transmission license and appoint Blu-Bin as an authorized delegate of PYC. Failure to comply with this regulation could cost Blu-Bin and PYC up to CA$1,000 per day of operations. On top of that, both Mr. Pagan-Yourno and Mr. Riley would have to pay the Department of Financial Regulation of Vermont\u2019s costs and expenses for investigation and prosecution, including any attorney\u2019s fees involved. Not to mention how knowingly engaging in a money services business without a license carries potential criminal penalties in the form of a hefty fine and several years in prison as well. Seeing as how both PYC and Blu-Bit did not respond to any of the letters sent by the Department of Financial Regulations of Vermont, they now facing a court case in Vermont which is due any day now. It will be interesting to see how this will play out, especially considering how PYC is licensed federally through FinCEN. \u201cObviously we want to comply with any regulatory framework that needs to be complied with,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to run anything under the table, so to speak. But what we\u2019re trying to actually make sure is that this is properly taken care of. Because our understanding has been that the state doesn\u2019t really understand where this falls, so they\u2019re just trying to shove us into a box that we might not fit into.\u201d For now, the Bitcoin ATM sits unplugged next to Blu-bin\u2019s kiosk in the Church Street Mall. Mr. Riley clearly stated he has absolutely no plans to get rid of the machine, and PYC is not planning to submit a license application any time soon. While that decision may backfire in the end, Mr. Pagan-Yourno stated: \u201cI\u2019m not entertaining that at all. In actuality, I don\u2019t need a license, so them reaching out for something I don\u2019t need, it doesn\u2019t matter. They can\u2019t fine me on something I don\u2019t need.\u201d Sources : https://www.cavirtex.com/news http://digital.vpr.net/post/state-regulators-force-vermonts-only-bitcoin-atm-offline", "date": "2015-02-19T06:44:18+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 19}

It has the potential to help pay school fees and receive money from relatives working abroad. Many money transfers that work abroad charge a large fee. However Bitcoin has a minimal fee which means it could improve the standard of life in Africa. In Africa the households that have money issues can get to grips with their incomes and out goings with Bitcoin. In Africa the average cost using money transfer services such as western union is 12% of the amount you send. This essentially means if you send $1,000 you lose $120 which leading to the opposite party only receiving $880. However a few services are realising the boundless opportunities currencies such as Bitcoin can have. A while back Bitpesa was introduced in Kenya and created a noticeable difference and allowed easy transfers of money. Now a new service called Beam has been introduced. It has a simple site and shows you how it compares with other money transferring services such as western union and MoneyGram. The service has a simple idea where you send them Bitcoin, they convert it to Ghana Cedi\u2019s and then they send the money via mobile instantly. This shows how Bitcoin will hopefully make a huge positive impact to normal working people and how more and more people are realising how Bitcoin can help them. However there are many more places where the addition of a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin can help. Also Bitcoin is a currency without borders and its safety means it is a good way to send money and many services can benefit from Bitcoin. However the only drawback is Bitcoins volatility as it has had a bumpy ride since it was around $13 in January, then went to $1,147 and at the time of writing was $238.3. Furthermore many banks do not yet accept Bitcoin and it is still a widely unrecognised currency. Not many people have heard of Bitcoin and are yet unaware of the positive difference it can make. The constant price changing means that the cedi could change and this usually plays havoc with Bitcoin services as it means the customer could receive less or the service might give away too much as a the price might change at the same time as they send money. The service means that money can be sent quickly and safely. Hopefully many more services will be made that utilise Bitcoin and will mean there are more opportunities for Bitcoin users.", "date": "2015-02-18T22:47:35+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 18}

The owner, Ross Ulbricht, was convicted on charges of being involved in the ownership of Silk Road. Silk Road was a large online marketplace where virtually anything could be sold including illegal drugs and weapons. On Silk Road around 70% of the products were drugs however they had some limits and items including stolen credit cards, assassinations and weapons of mass destructions such as chemical and nuclear weapons. However some products on the site were legal such as jewellery and art .Silk Road was shut down in October 2013 after it was found to be selling illicit goods. Silk Road 2.0 was created and promised to have higher security. It was launched by the administrators of the original Silk Road and recreated the original site setup. The administrators also took the caution of creating copies just in case it was shut down again. He is expected to face 30 years to life imprisonment. He is expected to go on trial on the 15 May. Last year there was an auction which sold off 30,000 Bitcoins which were also in connection with Silk Road. Almost all the Bitcoins were sold to Tim draper and whether or not he wants to participate in this auction is unconfirmed. In the last auction the price of one Bitcoin was around $600 but now it is around $250. However the auction could not have come at a worse time as Bitcoin prices have been falling rapidly and have been really volatile recently. One of the main differences between the two auctions, not including the obvious amount and price change of Bitcoin, is that in the last one the marshals explicitly barred people from acting on behalf of Mr .Ulbricht but in the latest one has agreed to auction his Bitcoin. The price drop has meant that many buyers won\u2019t be interested but if the Bitcoins do keep getting sold the price could take a few hits. To be eligible to participate in this auction they must first prove their identities and then show they have enough money to participate. They must also prove they are not in any connection with the owner. Bidders in this latest auction will receive a six hour period to deliver their sealed bids for the Bitcoins. The auction was supposed to be private but the SSMS accidentally CC\u2019d some potential buyers answering questions on the auction.

As far as adoption goes this was the one event which in recent history moved Bitcoin prices up by $20. However a new competitor has made its way into the Bitcoin warfield. T-Mobile is now one of the biggest and only mobile operators which is aided in its adoption of Bitcoin via InPay, one of the country\u2019s biggest payment processor. It has come as a massive surprise as T-Mobile Poland paired up with Inpay to allow users to top up their mobile phone balances using Bitcoin. Using a simple voucher system users who purchase calling time can now expect to gain a 20% bonus when using Bitcoin. This comes as the first major attempt to kickstart Bitcoin in Poland with the country the latest pasture for Bitcoin to expand into. The following statement was released on the bitcoinet.pl site detailing the new partnership which will essentially allow users purchase mobile top-ups with Bitcoin The Bitcoin service provided by the Inpay payment provider is perfect for both the consumer and the corporate entity, T-Mobile. This is due to the way in which Bitcoin deposits are handled as in transactions many companies prefer to use fiat due to its stability and their preference for currency used in the country. Initially a Bitcoin deposit from a customer is handled by the payment processor, Inpay which also takes on the risk for any Bitcoin price fluctuation eliminating the probability the customer will receive less than expected. This also works out very nicely for T-Mobile as fiat currency is deposited into the bank accounts owned by T-Mobile. This is the common practice for those who accept Bitcoin in as many companies such as T-Mobile do accept Bitcoin but following Microsoft they dump their holdings in Bitcoin for much preferred fiat currency such as Dollars. Whilst this may be hurtful to the overall health of Bitcoin, this doe help propel the adoption of Bitcoin to further highs. Speculation Bitcoin may be heading for the skies but real world adoption remains as the main driving force for a healthy and thriving Bitcoin world. With Poland jumping on board further increasing the popularity and exposure of Bitcoin, the same change should also be reflected onto the markets with a healthy price jump after days of stagnation. Bitcoin is currently in a rapid stage of adoption with the coin spreading to the masses with the help of Bitcoin ATM\u2019s, and Services such as Inpay which have helped to make Bitcoin more functional to the general public.

At certain times, it even looked as if people were just throwing together an exchange as a \u201cget rich quick\u201d scheme, and their customers were taking the fall in the end. But things are looking up again, as a \u201cnew generation\u201d of Bitcoin exchanges is slowly seeing the light of day. UMEX, a Bitcoin exchange currently in an open beta stage, is one of those exchanges. It is becoming increasingly hard for a Bitcoin exchange to offer something it\u2019s competitors cannot, and UMEX is leading the charge on that front. Over the past few weeks, several order types have been added to the Bitcoin exchange platform, including Good Till Canceled and Day orders. Furthermore, the platform developers are also trying to take care of Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility by switching off regular Bitcoin trading and replacing it with an auction-like interface. Earlier today, the UMEX exchange announced their new feature aimed specifically at \u201cmajor traders\u201d in the world of Bitcoin. This feature would protect these big traders from facing liquidity problems, which is an issue present across multiple Bitcoin exchanges over the past few months. Especially with the recent price decline, people seem to be hoarding Bitcoin more than ever in the hopes of another price increase in the near future. Even the major Bitcoin traders are having a hard time to execute orders on the market. Once they put up a big order [on either the buy or sell side of the order book] on any exchange, people will try to avoid using that exchange until the big order is either filled or cancelled. As you can guess by now, those types of actions create liquidity issues, which is something UMEX wants to avoid at all costs. A solution to the liquidity issue comes in the form of a FAK (Fill and Kill) order type on the UMEX Bitcoin exchange platform. Said order type has many benefits, including not attracting unwanted attention from other traders on the platform. Furthermore, a FAK order is executed based on the current quotations on the market, and the unexecuted remainder of the order will be cancelled immediately, leaving no trace of it ever being there in the first place. Major Bitcoin traders will no longer have to break up their big orders into small chunks and spread it out across multiple exchanges in order to fly under the radar. With a FAK order type at your disposal, UMEX is looking to become the new Bitcoin exchange platform for both small and major traders alike.

With the first ever Bitcoin ATM to be installed in the Cardiff City Centre, it comes as a landmark achievement with the ATM being the first of its kind in Ireland. The following announcement was released by bitcoin wales which provided details on where how and when the ATM is going to be launched. Satoshi Point is the main sponsor for the ATM in Ireland and with it already having gained lots of experience from operating a whole network of Bitcoin ATM\u2019s in the UK it may as well be a matter of time till a network is present in Ireland. We also discover how the machine will be located in a prime area namely the Cardiff City centre. This will not only increase the exposure of Bitcoin but will also allow for easy access as the population of Bitcoiner\u2019s rises in Ireland. With a afterparty also organized it is hoped the launch of the Bitcoin ATM can go off with a bang. However some speculators imagine another Bitcoin ATM to be just as detrimental to the Bitcoin industry as all the rest. With the Bitcoin ATM providing an easy route for purchasing and selling Bitcoin, there could be a influx of new money to stabilize a currently unhealthy market or an influx of Bitcoin waiting to be sold, in which case the ATM may be used by those simply fed up with Bitcoin and ready to go out and exchange every single one. The question of security also comes to mind as the security promised by the ATM\u2019s may not be all its scratched up to be. With even the biggest of exchanges succumbing to hackers, will these ATM\u2019s be able to fight a growing war ? As highlighted by the recent spate of Bitcoin atm thefts, the ATM in Ireland is also subject to being stolen as the technology used in these machines may be simple , but the machine can be sold on the black market for a nice sum of money. With one of Mr Bitcoins ATM\u2019s already reported stolen, it seems as if the machines are valuable as scrap, the circuitry can easily be parted. However this also proves another challenge for the Bitcoin ATM in Ireland as the machine can easily be vandalized by people on late nights out as it is in the city center. Many also complain of the problems that Bitcoin can bring on, such as the higher fee and usability issues which prevent new Bitcoin users from jumping on the boat. Whilst vandalism and theft may plague the new Bitcoin ATM, it is hopeful this ATM will bring the Bitcoin spirit to Ireland which is one of the latest countries to be hit by the Bitcoin ATM fever.

It uses Bitcoin to send money to mobiles and with the service you can now send $10-$100 to mobiles in over 117 different countries. This new service means you can send money to other mobiles across borders with ease and security without having long waiting times for your loved one or relative to receive the money. It has a simple interface where you can simply send Bitmoby the Bitcoin and it sends the mobile top-up. The site also guides users as to where you can buy Bitcoin, and the two exchanges Bitmoby works with. It is also quite simple as it does not require any private information or have to be registered with any mobile money operators. It simply requires the phone number, to the user you want to send money to, the country where they are and an email address. The service then allows the user to choose how much money they wish to send. Then they send the chosen amount in Bitcoin to an address. During this process the user gets a window which shows the address to which they have to send the Bitcoin and no matter how rapidly the price may change the required Bitcoin stays the same for the 10 minutes the window is open for. \u201cWe are trying to exploit the fact that, with Bitcoin (unlike card-based transactions), we can directly embed transaction information in the Bitcoin QR code and wallet address which means no \u2018shopping cart\u2019 or \u2018check out\u2019 process is required,\u201d However the project is still in its early stages and has a lot more potential and has time to develop a lot more. It can also incorporate daily or monthly top-up limits as this would make it easier and more stable. As it develops further hopefully it will have increased awareness and have more features. There are also other services that allow you to transfer money in a similar way, such as Bitpesa which allows an easy and convenient way to pay. \u201cMobile top \u2013up is purchased in cash around the world with no customer registration information, so why should we require it? We don\u2019t care who is paying us. So long as we have the funds, we will do the transaction.\u201d They are also currently looking for a different way to store their Bitcoin as they hope to find a unique way rather than the conventional ways they are currently stored. The service, which is based in Australia, served six countries but has made the leap from a few countries to many as they hope to broaden their reach and me able to send money to countries most services can\u2019t. This service has joined the few others that realise the potential of Bitcoins reach and use it to their advantage as it is safer and faster than other fiat currencies. Overall it is a very useful service and will hopefully inspire others and expand the Bitcoin community.

Whether you use iOS or Android, there are plenty of mobile Bitcoin wallets to choose from. However, AirBitz is the very first to offer Bluetooth LE support for making a Bitcoin payments \u2013 giving it a distinct advantage over their competitors. Iphone users have been able to enjoy the Bluetooth LE support for their AirBitz wallet for nearly four months now, whereas Android users had to wait a little longer. That wait is finally over, assuming you can run Android 5.0 Lollipop on your device that is. Most Android 5.0 devices \u2013 including the new Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 \u2013 will be able to use the BLE technology implemented in the AirBitz Bitcoin wallet. Contrary to several other mobile Bitcoin wallets, which seem to focus on NFC (Near Field Communication) payment options, AirBitz is clearly focusing on ease-of-use by implementing technology used by as many people as possible. Bluetooth LE will be used by far more people than NFC ever will, which also gives it a better chance at adoption by merchants and retailers. Speaking of ease-of-use, Bitcoin payments via Bluetooth also remove the need to generate and scan QR codes, which can be prove to be quite a burden in their own right. While generating and scanning these codes is relatively fast, you do need a camera that can focus quickly and properly, a screen with anti-glare, and so forth. Most Bitcoin users are not experiencing issues with QR codes, but it can be quite a different story when novice users are involved. Furthermore, AirBitz is one of the few mobile Bitcoin wallets offering cross-platform payments, thanks to the Bluetooth LE integration. Android and iOS users can send each other Bitcoin via Bluetooth without any issues, and the devices do not even have to be paired either. Close proximity between two devices will establish the required connection to finalize the Bitcoin transaction. The protocol making payments via Bluetooth LE possible is an open standard which has caught the attention of multiple Bitcoin Core developers. It will be interesting to see whether or not these developers will reach out to AirBitz in order to integrate the protocol in other mobile wallets, and maybe even existing payment gateways. AirBitz is definitely willing to collaborate with interested parties. About Airbitz Airbitz was founded in January 2014. We aim to bring bitcoin to the next billion users through an amazingly simple yet feature rich mobile wallet focused on ease of use and ease of security. Our focus is to deliver software with an amazing user experience, both visually and functionally, simplifying this advanced technology and delivering it to the masses while still retaining Bitcoin\u2019s core principles of decentralization and privacy.

Several states already allow for politicians to accept digital currency donations [up to a certain limit]. The Tennessee Senate recently drafted a bill which would allow for political digital currency donations in their state as well, and to make it even better, the bill passed on First Consideration. Similar to cash donations for a political campaign, digital currency donations can only be accepted up to a certain limit. These types of payments can only be allowed by adding the term\u201d digital currency\u201d in between the existing terms of \u201cpayment\u201d and \u201cgift\u201d. While this may seem to be rather futile, it is important for the future of Bitcoin and other digital currencies to have these bills drafted up using traditional techniques. The Tennessee Senate Bill 674 would allow a candidate or political campaign committee to accept contributions in the form of digital currencies. Every digital currency contribution will be considered a monetary contribution with the value of the specific digital currency being the market value of the digital currency at the time of receiving the contribution. As most of you are well aware, digital currencies are prone to volatile price swings, which means a contribution of that kind could become more or less valuable over time. In the event of the value increasing, the political candidate or campaign committee will be required to to report this increase in the form of an interest on any statement filed pursuant to \u00a7 2-10-105. Unfortunately, there is also a downside to using digital currencies for supporting a political candidate. All candidates or political campaign committees are required to sell any digital currency and deposit the proceedings from these sales into a campaign account before spending the funds. This means we will not see any political candidates holding digital currency donations in the form they came in unfortunately, but at least the name of the currency will be on their mind. Even though Tennessee Senate Bill 674 references to \u201cdigital currencies\u201d instead of just \u201cBitcoin\u201d, we all know ) more than likely \u2013 Bitcoin will be the only form of digital currency donation accepted by [most] political candidates. However, it would be rather fun and unique to see a candidate go out on a limb by accepting Litecoin or Dogecoin at some point in time. Assuming -for the sake of argument \u2013 that only Bitcoin donations will be accepted during political campaigns, BitPay seems to be the perfect candidate to process these donations. After all, the BitPay website has its own dedicated section about \u201cBitcoin for Political Donations\u201d, including the company\u2019s FEC and Campaign Finance Laws compliance. One of the strengths of Bitpay\u2019s bitcoin payment processing platform is the \u201cZero Bitcoin Liability\u201d for the person accepting this popular digital currency. BitPay lets you convert any incoming transaction to fiat currency automatically, and they will even make daily deposits to your bank account \u2013 assuming there is funds coming in on a daily basis.

However, the absences of any regulation over the coin and the mass payments that are being made with the cryptocurrency have brought it to the attention of the European Banking Authority, also known as the EBA. One of the main tasks of the EBA is to monitor all of the existing financial activities and adopt guidelines in an effort to create a form of deontology that will be respected by all who are involved. With this in mind, after a couple of months of tough analysis, the European Banking Authority has found Bitcoin to be an emerging market with a lot of potential. The analysis that has been carried out also stated that virtual currencies such as Bitcoin aren\u2019t regulated, thus the risks are unmitigated. As more and more people begin to be aware of the coin, many find themselves questioning whether Bitcoin represents a system worth trusting or not. This is where the Bitcoin Foundation intervenes, as they have carried out a tough risk management study wherein a couple of interesting factors essential for the success of the cryptocurrency are outlined. After an assessment of all documents, it was discovered that, in the current state of the market, reputation is a whole lot more important when compared to regulation, which basically doesn\u2019t really exist. The lack of Bitcoin regulation can be considered the birthplace of a new concept that companies dealing with Bitcoin should keep a close eye on. Not only will those with a quality reputation thrive in the long run, but by assessing the current market state, economists have also indicated that these are the companies that will be able to charge higher prices. In turn, businesses that do not have a clean track record and a solid reputation to base facts on will find themselves falling down the ladder of popularity. Those that are found to be defrauding people will most likely experience the same outcome. As far as the regulation is concerned, it is important for the Bitcoin market not to think of it as essential, as recent reports indicate that having an established set of rules for the currency will make it more prone to entering politics, in which case no one really knows what could happen. With this in mind, it is believed that people will lose money when dealing with shady online businesses, but the overall sum will be much greater in the case that Bitcoin loses the autonomic status that has granted it so much popularity. While some believe that allowing the government to meddle with the coin will mark the end of the coin, others aren\u2019t against regulations, so opinions are really divided in this case. What do you personally think about the analysis carried out by the EBA? Would governments be trustworthy if it ever came down for them being in charge of Bitcoin regulation?

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-cause-addiction-learn-deal/", "author": "Daniel Dob", "title": "Does Bitcoin cause addiction? Learn how to deal with it", "content": "Addiction probably represents one of the hardest things that our society had to cope with for hundreds of years until now and there still isn\u2019t a clear cure meant to combat it. From gambling, cigarettes, alcohol and drugs, addiction represents a growing problem that millions of people have to deal with on a daily basis, many of whom are unfortunately defeated and continue with their addiction without caring about their health or money. In today\u2019s society, where the Internet has taken over the world, that are a couple of emerging addictions including those for online gambling, gaming and even watching TV shows. However, one of the newest additions to the chart is the cryptocurrency addiction, which can manifest itself in a surprising number of ways. For Bitcoin, things started back in 2014 when people who had already invested a certain amount of money in the coin and just wanted to try it out, became rich overnight, as its value increased to a whopping $1200 in a matter of weeks. Most of these people instantly became Bitcoin enthusiasts and started using the Bitcoin for a wide array of things including online gambling, as it represented a way to get a lot of money fast, without worrying about anything in the world. However, as they continued to trade, learn more about the coin and make large amounts of money, while losing even larger sums, many of them became obsessed with the idea of cryptocurrencies, and developed an addiction never encountered by scientists before. Additionally, these upon running out of Bitcoins, these people also started changing real currencies into the coin, thus losing even more money in the long run. For many, it wasn\u2019t only gambling, where large amounts could be won and lost, but it also came down to selling the coin, investing in things that had no sense and trading commodities, all behind their screens. Don\u2019t get me wrong as Bitcoin is meant to be a currency that can be freely used for just about anything, but there should always be a limit to how much some spend with it both in terms of time, but also of money. Studies have also shown that around half of those who have lost all their Bitcoins gambling have instantly went ahead and purchased more as an effort to continue their gambling endeavors, thus bringing more failure in the long run, as things were not thought through. Using Bitcoin has and will probably represent a risk for the next couple of months, until the value of it increases again and it decides to swing around a certain price. Until then, it is careful to make sure that no one falls into addiction because too much of everything has always had its own risks. However, Bitcoin is perfectly safe for almost any type of transaction as long as it is not illegal and overdone as that would bring in other sorts of trouble. Using both cryptocurrencies, but also normal currencies for large transactions, investments, buying products or for gambling is a risk and those doing it with Bitcoin should be well aware of this. As there is a possibility for those who gamble with Bitcoin to develop addictions, please let us know if you know anyone that has battled with a cryptocurrency addiction until now.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/investing-bitcoin-good-idea-given-current-state-currency/", "author": "Daniel Dob", "title": "Investing With Bitcoin, A Good Idea Given The Current State Of The Currency?", "content": "Every day which passes represents a step-up in the overall popularity of Bitcoin, which makes people from all around the world begin asking a series of different questions which would normally be asked about normal currencies in general. One of these is whether any company, or individual should be willing to accept investments in the currency and try out investing with Bitcoin. To put things better into perspective, trading stocks and making investments in government controlled currencies has been going out for an incredibly long period of time. As more and more people decide to adopt Bitcoin, many of them begin to wonder whether keeping investing in a certain stock market is a wise thing to do using the currency. Additionally, companies from all around the world are wondering about the same thing. Should they go ahead and accept an investment from a certain trust or organization in Bitcoin? Well, it depends. Economic analysis has proven that the volatile state of the coin can sometimes make trading with large sums a risk, which is understandable. While the exchange rate may be of $240/ 1 btc today, it can drop to $100 in a month in the case that severe fluctuations happen. Additionally, as you may already know, the value of the Bitcoins receive from a transaction can also increase, thus making it more profitable from all the points of view. To put things better into perspective, the wisest idea at this moment would be to show a concrete example. Company X needs $100,000 to be able to launch a new product by the end of the year. To get the money, they decide to approach different investors and organizations with the power to give out that amount of money. Unfortunately, they find no one willing to grant even a part of it, regardless of the possible returns. However, they do not feel like giving up, after already investing a certain amount of money in the project. Fortunately, \u2018John\u2019 approaches them and offers a deal: 400 Bitcoins in exchange for a return of 500 Bitcoins in 5 years. By doing so, John is risking all of his money (both because investing can be dangerous, but also because the value of the coin can decrease) but is also hopeful, as he believes in the project. Now, the next logical question would be what Company X needs to do? Accept the payment and take the risk of having to pay back an incredibly larger amount of money if the value increases? What if the value decreases and they only have to pay around $1000 for 500 Bitcoins in the next 5 years? This example doesn\u2019t only give out a couple of questions, but it also gives out the solution to most of them. Investing and accepting Bitcoin investments, with returns which are also promised in the cryptocurrency is a two sided blade. There may be an increase or stagnation, each with the possibility of helping out both the investor and the company which is being invested in, depending on the flow of the market at later, which makes it very similar to gambling. To sum things up, the volatile state of the currency at this moment would not really allow for secure, huge and long-term transactions to take place. If things are designed to go over a short period of time, then everything would be alright, but proceed with great caution if you find yourself in the position of accepting or investing with Bitcoin.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/will-fall-u-s-economy-help-bitcoin/", "author": "Daniel Dob", "title": "Will The Fall Of The U.S. Economy Help Bitcoin?", "content": "One of the first questions that someone who has just started using Bitcoin would probably ask is, who dictates the value of the currency? Well, there are a wide variety of factors that play quite an important role in whether the value of Bitcoin raises and whether more people start using the cryptocurrency for their everyday needs. Today, we\u2019ll discuss about whether a weak economy in a certain country would actually have any influence on the coin. As in the last couple of months, the US has had quite a lot of economic problems, the question would be, if a weak U.S. economy or a certain decrease in the value of the dollar would actually prove to be beneficial to the coin for a certain period of time? Well, according to some analysts, the answer would be definitely yes! As the value of a law governed currency decreases, people who hold large amounts of money in that currency begin to wonder whether it would be wise consider moving to another one, as an effort to keep stored funds safe. Well, out of this percentage of people who decide to make the change, many may actually be driven into alternative investments like cryptocurrencies, so obviously, into Bitcoin at the moment. To put things better into perspective, people have always considered commodities such as gold, diamonds, silver or fine art as reserves that are safe regardless of the current state of the economy of a country. The same concept could also be applied to Bitcoin in the case of another economic crisis that would require people to drop the dollar and actually invest in a currency that is more valuable, but also has the chances to increase later down the road. With this in mind, can the idea of mass adoption really be consider a possibility in the case that the hoarding mentality that people from all around the world have is not engaged? Based on everything that has been outlined so far, the actual value of the coin is dictated by the people, as there\u2019s no major enterprise that has the possibility to do so. Although what happens next cannot be predicted, there are certain speculative ideas that will grant people an idea of how to influence the coin. The richer the party gets and the more people purchase and utilize the cryptocurrency, the more its value will increase. However, not only the U.S. economy has the possibility to change the evolution of the coin. In the case that the Euro falls for example, most of the people in Europe who hold important sums of money in the currency will begin looking for alternatives, one of which is Bitcoin. Before that happens, as a family of users, we have the responsibility to encourage more and more people to use the coin and make as many payments with it as possible, as this will make it a viable option in the case that the economy of any country or falls and the value of a currency decreases.

With this in mind, many of the users want it to become bigger, and the only way that something like this has the potential of happening is if more ideas that can help mass adoption are speculated. A very interesting concept that more and more companies, but also individuals are getting interested in is sending and receiving salaries in Bitcoin. There are currently a couple of services such as Bitwage which offer the possibility to change a certain percentage of a user\u2019s salary in Bitcoin, but the main idea is to get companies to send the amounts in Bitcoin as well. Of course, the idea will not be appreciated by everyone in the beginning and many may hesitate to get their salaries in the cryptocurrency. However, by granting those who are interested the possibility to receive 5% or more of their salary in Bitcoin, then more and more households will be proudly able to say that they have a certain amount of money accumulated in Bitcoin, which is exactly what is needed. As the value of the coin increases, so will the value of what they already have stored will. With this in mind, whenever something beneficial happens to Bitcoin, employees who are interested can request to receive a higher percentage of their salaries in Bitcoin, which will make the coin become more and more popular, in areas from all around the world. All it takes for this idea to become a reality is a big company with enough resources which already accepts Bitcoin to go ahead and start offering their employees this possibility. As over 150 airlines may also start accepting payments in Bitcoin, this gives them the unique opportunity to pay their employees using the same method. The idea can also be linked to an event that has shaped the evolution of our modern society- the appearance of the mobile phone. Once the device went mainstream, people started to drop their landlines one by one, in favour of the smaller device which was better from all the points of view. So will the evolution of this concept be as soon as a famous company makes the first step and decides to pay users with the cryptocurrency. Once the rates increase and more people decide to receive their salaries in Bitcoin, the popularity of it will also rocket, as more payments will start to be made from Bitcoin wallets, which also means that other companies will be obliged to take up on the idea and start accepting and giving payments in the coin as well. However, it is also important to remember that decisions like these also have their own risks due to the volatile state of the coin. Hopefully, the future will bring a rise in value and a stabilization around a certain rate, which would represent the perfect timing for a Bitcoin based salary system to be introduced.

What if a government considers that because more and more people are picking up Bitcoin, the actual value of the national currency will decrease and ban the coin as a result of this presumption? However, can they really do something like this when it isn\u2019t even recognized as an official currency? Well, the practical answer would be no, but there\u2019s always a possibility which is a good enough reason for Bitcoin users from all around the world to fight against all government imposed regulation. Not long ago, the European Union has begun debating different acts, some of which involve Bitcoin directly, even if not clearly specified. One of these legislation acts includes the idea that companies are susceptible to paying taxes regardless of the form of payment and that they need to provide a form of proof related to where people that have made transactions with them come from. However, is this really right? Does anyone believe that the thought of this law not breaking the anonymity provided by Bitcoin didn\u2019t cross their minds? Things are a bit more complicated than this, but as an effort to ensure that the cryptocurrency gets more and more popular, governments would need to start fighting the second biggest authority in the world, which is basically the one that they depend on- corporations, which, of course, have money. By trying to reach mass adoption and getting more and more companies involved in the trading of Bitcoin, countries and organizations which may want to make the coin obsolete for their own profit will have a harder time doing so. By keeping these factors in mind and coming up with more and more ways to promote the coin, the organizations which are against it will have less to do, which is exactly what is needed to make its value increase and transform it into the universal currency of the Internet and why not, of the offline environment as well. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, the fact that legislation has the possibility of influencing Bitcoin is really something that both individuals using the coin, but also companies that have adopted it have to keep an eye on to ensure that it will remain ungoverned and that it will continue to become better and better later down the road. What do you personally think about the influence that the legislative apparatus can have over the coin? Do you think that a point will be reached when Bitcoin fans will have to fight against the laws to help the cryptocurrency keep the autonomy that it is famous for?

However, what does the euro have to do with Bitcoin and why are we discussing it now? While comparing Bitcoin to any other type of currency is almost impossible due to the incredibly large number of differences, there is something quite common between the Euro and the cryptocurrency. Very much like Bitcoin, the euro was adopted at a time when all countries which were going to use it already had their own financial system and currencies set up, which meant that getting a currency like this in wouldn\u2019t really make sense. However, as an effort to unite European countries and increase economic ties between those which are members of the European Union, the euro was adopted as the official currency of 19 countries at the moment, ever since the currency appeared back in the year of 1995. What links the two currencies refer to the fact that even though countries in the European Union already had a stable financial system, all the way with official currencies set up for each, it was thought that the new currency would provide what was needed to make countries in Europe grow closer together and form a wide array of different economic partnerships. With this factor in mind, many have wondered why Bitcoin would be useful when there is already a fiat currency established in countries from all around the world. Well, in this sector, the Bitcoin can be considered the universal currency of the world, whereas the Euro can be considered the universal currency of Europe. Back when it was released, the value of the Euro wasn\u2019t high in value at all, and it begun with slight value stagnations and increases, very much like the Bitcoin. As years passed, more and more countries started believing in the coin and began to adopt it, which is also one of the main reasons it currently has this amount of success. As it has always been said that history repeats itself, if things go according to plan, this is also exactly what is bound to happen with Bitcoin. However, some aspects will be different, as no government will be adopting the cryptocurrency, but rather the people, corporations and firms which begin accepting and issuing payments with its help. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, if there is another currency that people have desperately wanted to succeed apart from the Euro, which did, it is the Bitcoin. While there are many speculations about the future of the coin and what needs to be done to reach mass adoption, I would personally say that our society has to learn from the surprising luck and evolution of the euro and try to apply most of the same principles in the case of the Bitcoin as well, without limiting any of the benefits that it has the potential of offering.

What Are the Odds?", "content": "We\u2019ve had our share of Bitcoin thefts, so let\u2019s take a closer look at the security aspects of owning the coin. While it is definitely possible for someone who has Bitcoins to store them in a wallet directly on their hard drive, USB memory stick, or whatever portable storage device they prefer, many of the currentcurrency owners actually choose to keep their coins online in Bitcoin wallets, such as Blockchain. This practice is loved by people from all around the world mostly due to the fact that it makes dealing with the coin extremely easy, especially when compared to some of the alt coins present out there. Well, one serious issue that more and more people need to be aware of is the danger that stands behind the idea of keeping your coins in an online wallet. While exchanges and wallets can go bankrupt due to their own mistakes and leave thousands of people from all around the world without their Bitcoins, there is also the possibility of a Bitcoin wallet provider to become corrupt. With this being said, what if a Bitcoin wallet provider simply decides to quit and take all the Bitcoins that a certain user has? As you may already know, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, so once one has been made, there\u2019s no way to get coins transferred back, unless the person or company on the other end agrees to send it back. This issue is also serious because of the fact that the cryptocurrency is not currently governed by any laws, so what would really happen in the unfortunate case that a Bitcoin wallet decides to become a thief? Well, taking the funds away won\u2019t really be the issue here, as the Bitcoins are stored on actual hard drives, which belong to the company and are kept in a safe environment. With this in mind, a company can decide to turn their backs on the user at any time and cause lots of trouble. However, most countries now have laws which govern companies that deal with aspects which don\u2019t have a legal side, such as Bitcoin. With this being said, if a Bitcoin wallet company makes such an unfortunate decision, they will most probably be prosecuted in their country of residence for phishing, causing harm and even taking away what is not rightfully theirs, even if Bitcoin can be classified as non-existent in front of the law. In more complicated cases where a Bitcoin wallet provider may decide to go abroad with all of the coins, then a lawsuit together with penal chargers will be filled. However, there would currently be no feasible way for the funds to be transferred back to the rightful owner, unless backups would\u2019ve been made and the solution to the problem would be clearer. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, the concept of a Bitcoin trading company or Bitcoin wallet going corrupt is actually very real, and it is a part of the daily risks that those dealing in bitcoin have to endure. Until general legal standards will be set for the coin, people from all around the world will have to be careful where they keep their Bitcoin, while also making sure that they only pick trusted providers. In the unfortunate case that something like the scenery outlined above manages to happen, then chances are that Bitcoin will have a period of denigration, followed by an effort to set some straight rules, in order to avoid such events from ever happening again.

The bill essentially encourages the unlimited and free use of Bitcoin through out the state and is of one of the only bills with no special clauses at the moment. Below is a description given by the state on the bill which is to be considered for approval. The bill will not only stimulate the growth of Bitcoin in the US ultimately, but will also influence the use of Bitcoin directly. With Canada rapidly becoming a Bitcoin friendly country installing kiosks around the country, Utah has now taken the steps necessary to give the cryptocurrency the attention and value it deems necessary. The bill was exclusively announced just yesterday, and is in the process of being reviewed by the council and governor of Utah. The bill also states how Bitcoin is set to \u201cplay an increasingly important role in Utah\u2019s economy and culture\u201d, as Utah has realized the potential of cryptocurrencies and made the bill one of its first priorities. With fresh US money sitting on the sidelines it may only be a matter of time till it comes to aid with the recovery of the current Bitcoin market. The Future of Bitcoin in Utah Bitcoin has a very bright future in the state not only due to its heavy investment in new technology but also the growing interest in various cryptocurrencies which has been accumulating as media coverage of Bitcoin increases. Now with Bitcoin being recognized at a state level it seems that even the government are taken aback with the rampage set off by Bitcoin. With Bitcoin already a Billion Dollar industry and it\u2019s importance as a cryptocurrency of the future already recognized, the progress made by some states is surprising, as initially the state was against Bitcoin with many politicians smearing Bitcoin off as a ponzi and a scam. Utah is home to a developing Bitcoin currency but when recognized among other states around the country it comes as little surprise these regulations were drafted up. With business eager to get into the Bitcoin boat the industrial value of Bitcoin is extremely under rated at the moment. With low fees and instant transactions it is hoped that Bitcoin becomes the currency of choice for both business and citizens in Utah.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/will-apple-pay-adopt-bitcoin-form-payment/", "author": "Daniel Dob", "title": "Will Apple Pay Adopt Bitcoin As A Form Of Payment?", "content": "Apple represents one of the new companies capable of creating an online payment system which has the chances of becoming mainstream, and that\u2019s exactly what the Cupertino based company has achieved with Apple Pay. If you\u2019re not yet aware, Apple Pay is basically an iOS app that allows users to add credit cards and bank accounts and then easily pay for different products at retail shops or services at the cash register, by touching the iPhone on a specific device, while also scanning their finger for a confirmation of the payment. As the software is becoming more and more famous, people from all around the world started calling it the Bitcoin killer, as it makes paying for things incredibly easy. The main question is: Why is it so? To be honest, there are quite a large number of benefits between the two payment systems, mostly due to the fact that Apple Pay works with worldwide recognized currencies that are governed by a large number of laws and only in the base of a debit/credit card or a bank account. Instead of putting Bitcoin and Apple Pay one against each other, why not consider the possibility of Apple Pay adopting Bitcoin as a form of payment in the future? By analysing the current situation, the option outlined above would be viable to Apple, regardless of the volatile status of the currency. In the case that the value of Bitcoin increases or decreases, users are usually the ones to feel the outcome, so Apple will not get hurt in the unfortunate case of another value fall. By imagining a pre-defined set of rules, the truth is that Apple Pay would probably act like a good wallet for storing Bitcoin, while also making payments with the coin easier for people all around the United States where Apple Pay is currently becoming more and more popular. Another idea would be for Apple Pay to act like the direct key to a Bitcoin wallet, which would mean that Apple won\u2019t even have to store the coins on their own hard drive, thus making things better both for the company, but also for Apple Pay users who decide that this is something they need. Together with everything that has been mentioned, another factor of encouragement would refer to the simple fact that other billion dollar companies are already accepting and issuing payments in Bitcoin, so why wouldn\u2019t Apple take the risk as well? After all, there\u2019s not much to lose as long as a viable partnership is made between them and a Bitcoin wallet service provider, or in the case that Apple Pay actually turns into a Bitcoin wallet. Not only will Apple Pay attract more users this way, but it will also quicken the development of Bitcoin and encourage mass adoption, which is exactly what cryptocurrency fans from all around the world are currently hoping for. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, what do you think about the idea of Apple Pay becoming a Bitcoin wallet, or the direct key to one? Is it something that would be worth it for Apple?

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/overcoming-7-transactions-per-second-bitcoin-limit/", "author": "Daniel Dob", "title": "Overcoming The 7 Transactions Per Second Bitcoin Limit", "content": "When Bitcoin was first created and didn\u2019t have nearly the popularity that the coin has at this moment in time, it was believed that the standard system would be good enough for the future of the currency. However, on light of certain events and based on the increasing popularity of the cryptocurrency, it seems like the block size limit may actually need to be increased from 1 MB. If you\u2019re not really a fan of digesting the technical aspects of Bitcoin and how it works, this probably wouldn\u2019t be of concern to you. However, chances are that most Bitcoin users from all around the world hope that Bitcoin will actually become the currency of the future, but how can that really happen in the case that it currently only handles 7 transactions per second? Yes, that\u2019s right. Each second, only 7 people are able to make a transaction, which is mostly due to the block size limit of a Bitcoin. To put things into a better perspective, only 420 people can make a transaction during the same minute. While this may seem like a large number, it definitely isn\u2019t as nobody wants to wait minutes or even seconds before a transaction is actually completed. Now, the only plausible way to solve the issue at this moment in time would be to increase the block size from 1 MB to 20 MB. This would not only allow for a significantly higher number of transaction per second, but it will also be viable as more and more people decide to try out the cryptocurrency and make payments with it on a daily basis. Reports have shown that most core developers actually want to increase the block size limit and while there is in fact a limit that the block size limit margin cannot get over, it definitely is higher than 1 MB. Many people now believe that it would be better to use sidechains, as research has shown that they can easily help in this regard. By providing the avenues needed to increase the scalability that is obtained when a block chain reaches its size limit, sidechains can actually do more good and be of crucial importance to a healthy currency. While the benefits have been outlined, you may be wondering why the block size limits aren\u2019t just increased. Well, things are a little bit more complicated than this as a limit increase would mean weeks of work for those behind the currency and all websites and companies that allow the use, including the well-known blockchain.info. However, if enough awareness is raised about the issue and Bitcoin gets more popular, the folks who have the power needed to change the block size limit may actually do it after all. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, what do you personally think about the idea of increasing the block chain size limit from 1 MB to 20 MB as an effort to allow for more than 7 transactions per second?

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/banks-begin-offering-bitcoin-accounts-2/", "author": "Daniel Dob", "title": "Banks To Begin Offering Bitcoin Accounts?", "content": "Quite an interesting fact in today\u2019s society refers to the simple idea that banks are disliked by people from all around the world, due to the wide variety of scandals that they have been involved in along the years. However, it is important to acknowledge that banks are essential for the progress of a capitalism based country. What do you think about Bitcoin accounts? Every once in a while, once there is a new trend on the finance market, banks are usually the first to pick it up, change it up a bit and offer it to their clients as a service. This practice is not new at all and has been going on for years, right under our noses, but also to our benefit, because after all, there isn\u2019t really any other place where large amounts of money can be stored or borrowed. However, has anyone thought about the idea of banks adopting Bitcoin and joining the market cryptocurrency market until now? The unique idea is based on the fact that most banks from all around the world offer to create accounts in different currencies, some of the universal ones found in most countries being USD, EUR and GBP. Well, what if banks would start offering Bitcoin account services, where users would be able to store all of their hard earned Bitcoin? This could also be the place where all Bitcoin transactions are made from, so when a user receives some Bitcoin, it can go directly into the bank account and be stored as USD would normally be stored. Not only will this be beneficial for those who often find that they do not trust online wallets with large amounts of Bitcoin, but are also afraid that storing them on a hard drive can be dangerous practice as well. Of course, a hard drive Bitcoin wallet can be stored in a bank safe, where it will be kept away from the curious eyes of others; however, this won\u2019t really grant any service as users will still have to access the hard drive whenever they need to make a transaction. The idea of Bitcoin bank accounts can also be beneficial for the banks, as they could start offering users the power to ask for Bitcoin loans, therefore win from the interest rates. With this in mind, banks could also go ahead and offer those who decide to create Bitcoin accounts an interest as they normally would with real currencies. To put things into a better perspective, if the idea is implemented, it would allow both banks and customers to be happy and make quite a nice profit while they are at it, especially if large sums are involved. The concept also has the power of making the coin more popular, as banks have been here for hundreds of years and they are generally trusted when it comes down to issues like this. Another factor which is worth keeping in mind is that as the cryptocurrency is not governed by any universal law, banks could go ahead and develop their own pre-defined set of rules, as an effort to keep everything running smoothly. In the case that the idea outlined here goes big, banks can easily set partnerships and cooperate to ensure that their Bitcoin storing rules are universal and that everyone offering the service is following them strictly.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/eu-tax-laws-influence-bitcoin-market/", "author": "Daniel Dob", "title": "EU Tax Laws To Have An Influence On The Bitcoin Market?", "content": "The truth is that one of the most loved things about Bitcoin refers to the simple fact that the currency is not governed by any major laws at this moment in time, which means that people are free to make transactions anonymously and not have to worry about too many legal aspects, which also happens to be one of the main reasons behind the currency\u2019s popularity. Well, things may be about to change over in the European Union, as a recent amendment to the EU tax laws could actually bring trouble to the cryptocurrency. This amendment which we will discuss in a second has the unneeded potential of making transactions more difficult. While the law doesn\u2019t focus directly on Bitcoin, it does however say that in an effort to ensure that the Value Added Tax, also known as VAT is paid on all of the electronic transactions; companies making them will now need to record the country of residence for each of their customers. Together with this, companies which deal with electronic transactions will also need to provide proof from two sources as they record the country of residence of users who have placed orders through them, which represents a factor that makes things even harder. While Vanessa Mock, who is an EU commission spokesperson insisted that the new law hasn\u2019t been created with the purpose of seeking the identity of everyone in the virtual environment, companies operating online still have to prove where their customers live. How is this related with Bitcoin? Well, whenever a Bitcoin transaction is made, it is operated with the help of a user\u2019s IP. In the case that this law is deemed constitutional and starts being applied, then companies would have to show that they are making sufficient efforts to get access to the two sources indicating the residence of their customers, one of which would definitely be the IP address. However, it is also worth keeping in mind that while this represents a minor obstacle in the neutrality and anonymity of Bitcoin transactions, users were never really invisible! This is so as most site track the IP of the people accessing them and Bitcoin transaction services may do the exact same thing! Anyway, this only means that the country of residence is given, but the anonymity of the user initiating or accepting a transaction may still be protected. Based on all of these legislative events which have been closely monitored in the last couple of weeks, Bitcoin supporters will believe that the company should not be governed by any laws. However, it may be important for some basic legislation to stay in place as an effort to ensure that Bitcoin users from all around the world stay away from illegality and do not use the coin for shady transactions.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/rise-price-marks-end-bitcoin-value-stagnation/", "author": "Daniel Dob", "title": "Rise In Price Marks The End Of The Bitcoin Value Stagnation?", "content": "The truth is that we all miss the times when one Bitcoin was of around $1000 in value, but the chances for the coin to increase in value are quite high at this moment in time. Just last night, the Bitcoin price was lucky enough to see an advance which brought it to $240 for one Bitcoin. This doesn\u2019t only represent the first step towards ensuring that the decline in the value will end, but it also pinpoints that the coin will probably get more valuable sooner than initially expected. While the price fluctuation today may seem modest, analysis has shown that it actually holds great implications both for traders, but also for holders of the cryptocurrency. With this factor in mind the significance of the advance is actually its particular wave construction, as the fluctuations that we have seen over the last couple of days together with the increase of price that has sparked people\u2019s interest are all starting to play an important role in giving the currency the momentum that it is looking for. To shine a light on to how it\u2019s actually getting this momentum, it should be said that the sudden rises and falls of the coin\u2019s price are exactly what the cryptocurrency needs at this moment to begin an overall increase in value once again. Not only was this proven to work with official currencies, but the simple fact that the coin has been situated around the same level for a period of time should be enough proof to point that the impetus it is getting will shape the currency in the near future, which is probably great news for traders and holders from all around the world. By keeping an eye on the charts that have been released, but also on the official analysis of the trading trend at this moment, it is safe to say that we now find ourselves at a moment in time when investing in Bitcoin may actually turn out to be a great idea, as the market psychology has also gradually changed. By buying currency and holding on to it, the chances of gaining more once the value tends to increase greatly rises, mostly due to the fact that the coin has not seen an all-time low recently. Additionally, the buy/sell volume over on Bitfinex also shows that buyers are waiting for the prices to drop again and invest in the coin, all of it thanks to the momentum that it is gathering at this moment in time. The chart below outlines the fact that there are many buyers who are currently waiting below the price to invest in the coin with once it stagnates again, mostly due to the fact that the next stagnation will bring enough momentum to gets the coin\u2019s value up just like currency analysts are currently pointing out. However, this are still risky as sudden price fluctuations can mean both good news and bad news, so the best probably choice would be to analyse all charts and go with the gut instinct on this one, as the next wave of fluctuation gathered by the currency will bring an increase in the overall Bitcoin value.

Allowing all users of the VISA service to also have a Bitcoin address. This will also allow the address to be directly attached to the VISA account which will also allow the user to send Bitcoin directly to another VISA card. This new service aims to expand the public\u2019s knowledge of the cryptocoin and also hopes to introduce traders and civilians to the benefits of using crypto. The current Bitcoin price has been calm and controlled to say the least. With the prices only swaying a max of $5-6 up or down it seem as if only margin traders are able to make a killing whilst many long term bagholders are left with cold feet. However with indicators hinting at a price rise we can be sure that the prices will be worth the weight. With resistance at highs on the lower end of the scale it can safely be assumed that $220 will be a safe position for at least a weeks time. With buyers already opening up their orders waiting for cheap coins to roll in the resistance around this area is particularly big depending on the exchange. Volume is also one other factor worth considering as the current volume may not allow for much of a increase as it in turn limits the market cap. With no headroom for growth Bitcoin may be restricted but with intrest harboured and fiat ready we can be sure this will not be a problem for too long. Speculation Well the Bitcoin price seems to have solidified its position at the $230 mark and with Buy orders currently outweighing Sell orders it seems as if the demand for Bitcoin is heading the right way. With both demand and market prices are heading the right way boosting Bitcoin into further prosperity.

With exotic locations such as Thailand part of Bitcoin fever, Austria one of the worlds strongest economies is also in on Bitcoin with over 600 Bitcoin Kiosks dotted around the country. Bitcoinbon announced its service recently as it open up a huge number of Bitcoin kiosks all around Austria. Using a traditional system involving coupons, a user can easily purchase Bitcoins without having to be too technical or have knowledge about the coin.With the service initially starting out in starting out in tobacco shops it is hope at a lower risk people can ease into trying out Bitcoin whilst not having to worry about the volatility in the current markets. The service hopes to expand further and hopes to capitalize on the growing industries booming in Austria. Below is the short description given by the site on how this unique service is set to Bring Bitcoin to the masses in Austria. Using tried and tested systems the business plan for Bitcoinbon is secure as it hopes to secure the future of Bitcoin in Austria. Bitcoin has also made recent moves in Thailand with the far east country joining a whole host of countries from the area who are slowly moving towards the mass adoption of Bitcoin. Coins.co.th is the first site of its kind to offer Bitcoin based services to the citizens of Thailand. The country has seen a growing interest in Bitcoin with the far east rapidly becoming the home of Bitcoin. The site Coins.co.th is also back by the Phillipene version Coins.ph, the parent site. Users can easily deposit Bitcoin and sell Bitcoin for fiat direct to a bank account. Speculation This outward movement is the main driving force for mainstream adoption of Bitcoin but there are also various problems associated with this mass adoption.With less than a quarter of companies including Microsoft keeping their Bitcoin revenue the amount dumped on the market is increasing by the day. However with Kiosks installed at 600 venues in Austria it is hoped that new fiat will continue to flow into the Bitcoin industry further increasing the value of Bitcoin with the increasing demand. There is also a Bitcoin party scheduled in Jamaica with over 70k people attending. As many have already pointed out this may be the birth of 70k new sellers or holders.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-infographic-shows-evolution-future-currency/", "author": "Daniel Dob", "title": "Bitcoin Infographic Shows The Evolution And Future Of The Currency", "content": "Due to its volatile state, Bitcoin has the tendency to change quite often as indicated by all of the analysis that has been carried out so far. However, there are also other aspects about the cryptocurrency that have to be discussed in order to grant people a better perspective about its future. Today, we get the chance to take a look at an exciting Bitcoin infographic that was sent over by Bitpay, which also happens to be one of the world\u2019s best Bitcoin payment processors. With this in mind, leaving apart the value of the currency which both increased, but significantly decreased as well, it seems like one of the most intriguing fact refers to the simple idea that the trading volume of the cryptocurrency changed from $15 billion in 2013, to the whopping sum of $23 billion in 2014, which means that it has experienced a total increase of 57%. Additionally, another exciting fact which is worth pointing out is that the amount of active wallets has also increased up until 7.95 million, which means that regardless of its short fall in value, the currency is now more famous than it has ever been. The infographic provided by the folks at Bitpay also indicates that top 5 countries where Bitcoin is most popular. With this factor in mind, it seems like the U.S.A. remains on the top position, with most Bitcoin users established over there, but it is closely followed by Great Britain which has a similar amount of users to Canada. The top 4 country where Bitcoin has become incredibly popular is Germany, followed by the Netherlands. However, the year of 2015 is bound to bring in quite a large number of surprises, mostly thanks to China becoming involved in the market where there are tons of Bitcoin farms which produce thousands of coins on a daily basis. Additionally, we will also see a good increase in the amount of wallets, as people from all around the world continue to try out the cryptocurrency. In the fortunate case that the value for Bitcoin rises, then chances are that the trading volume will also face a great increase from the sum of $23 billion USD back in 2014 up to $30 billion or more in 2015, as analysts are currently speculating. The year of 2015 will not only make Bitcoin more popular for individuals, but it will also most probably bring a large increase in the amount of corporations and companies accepting it as a form of payment, which is great news for just about anyone who has tried the currency out, as the world continues to evolve and take up the coin as an universal currency. Additionally, chances are that the stress that that the currency finds itself under at this moment in time, will also be resolved, thus making it even more popular. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, the year of 2015 is definitely full of surprises. As the Bitcoin infographic has shown a great increase from 2013 to 2014, an even greater one will probably be seen during this year, with more and more people making the decision of joining the Bitcoin market.

For example, in Indonesia and in a couple of countries in Africa where this test was carried out, when groups were interviewed, they were excited to talk about how they use Facebook on a daily basis, but new little to nothing about their means of getting online. A survey has even shown that around 3-4% of worldwide mobile phone users with access to the Internet are willing to say that they use Facebook and NOT the Internet as a means of getting there. However, it is worth noticing that regardless of knowing nothing about the means of accessing sites like Facebook for example, people continue to do so. The concept outlined can be the birthplace of a new idea, meant to simplify many aspects in our daily lives, including the use of Bitcoin. This error or discrepancy as we\u2019d call it is actually a lot more spread that we may initially think, which brings us to the subject of whether Bitcoin represents an understandable idea for people or not. One of the biggest issues with Bitcoin at this moment in time is the fact that many still do not understand and use the currency. The process of explaining how it works together with its characteristics, the fact that it is a digital commodity that exists without any control over it can be quite confusing for a beginner. Not to mention that the idea of bitcoin mining, the consensus decentralized network, the future of the currency and the concept of block-chain are words that most people without a background in the industry or who aren\u2019t very well informed wouldn\u2019t understand initially. To put things into a better perspective, what is it that needs to be done to bring the cryptocurrency to the masses? Well, for people to actually be able to make use of the currency, things will have to be greatly simplified. Starting from the way that Bitcoin is accumulated to the way that it is spent, each step of the process should be explained with clear terms, as a simple network that allows people to use the coin and make payments via it is born, as an effort to make the simplified use of Bitcoin idea a reality. By keeping these factors in mind, once the incentive needed comes along, chances are that companies which are currently in control of the Bitcoin market will begin to make the changes needed, as an effort to ensure that the coin will be available to the masses. By doing so, not only will the coin succeed from all the points of view, but the overall way that payments are made will also be changed, as the normal individual without an interest in cryptocurrency will probably not mind using it as long as it works like cash and it doesn\u2019t cause too much trouble. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, what do you personally think about the idea of an app that allows for the simplified use of Bitcoin and for people to send and receive money over a Bitcoin network without actually knowing anything about the currency?

With this in mind, Bitcoin recently played an important role in determining whether a crime was committed or not. Ross Ulbricht, who is one of the few people who had the possibility to run Silk Road, was recently arrested on drug trafficking charges. As he is considered to have been the kingpin behind the online drug bazaar, Ulbricht was recently investigated by the FBI and sent to trial after it was proven that millions of dollars made in Bitcoin payments were sent over to his account until the last day before the arrest. In order to try and free him, his attorney chose quite a surprising approach to the defense, stating that while Ulbricht did run the site, the millions of dollars in Bitcoins aren\u2019t actually his. While there is no way to prove that the money is his thanks to the anonymous nature of the cryptocurrency, the funds were actually stored on his laptop. Investigations have shown that September 2012 to August 2013, around 3760 Bitcoin transactions have been made on the same laptop of over 700,000 coins, which would mean around $18 million in total, all from the black market, therefore contradicting the defence which stated that the money came from Bitcoin trading. However, it is believed that the trial and conviction were both biased mainly due to the fact that a Bitcoin address is never linked to a name and there is no way to prove that the money was sent to him regardless of the fact that it arrived to his laptop. Things could\u2019ve been simply set up, yet the jury did not agree with the defence approach. By keeping everything that has been outlined so far in mind, is cryptocurrency beginning to play an important role in justice? Should there be a legislation governing virtual currencies?

Currently in a near unpredictable state many analysts are considering whether a trend reversal is possible but as far as predictions go they remain just that, predictions. Bitcoin prices currently have enough power to move up but individuals posses enough Bitcoin to move prices in the other direction. With current indicators looking positive Bitcoin has been given a Buy label with prices anticipated to recover within a weeks period. Currently the Bitcoin price is meeting a lot of resistance both at the $200 price point which is helping to keep prices stable but also at the $230 creating a bullish and bearish effect on the market at once. However many have pointed out the current price crash may have been have been due to Chinese manipulation and Bitfinex\u2019s influence over Bitcoin prices. It has also been explored that the owner of the exchange may have also plated a crucial role in manipulating prices. It is believed that he also admitted to using insider information to trade on his own exchange. It was also seen that there were random periods when the exchange reported 0 trading activity. This would have instantly raised eyebrows as many estimate the owner of the exchange may have liquidated sums of bitcoin more thank 250k. This dumping may have been one of the more clear cut reasons behind the current market turbulence. Well its the Bitcoin market so what can one say. Many speculate that the Chinese are behind the massive dumping that has occurred over the week. With volumes at extremely high levels, $23,371,600, a move up is possible but the market cap must expand further if highs of $300 are to be seen. However the possibility of a jump to $240 \u2013 $250 is still possible whilst a dangerous drop of below $200 is a real possibility at this stage with highs experienced this week outweighed by the drops seen. A drop of over $16 was experienced in a matter of minutes highlighting the volatility of the Bitcoin market currently in a downward trend. However it is never too late for a trend reversal and with the prices dipping further and further it is anticipated a rebound will begin quickly pushing prices to highs not seen for months.

BoostVC is a Venture Capitalist startup accelerator in the Bay Area that helps Bitcoin companies by \u201cproviding housing, office space, mentors and an investment.\u201d In this BandCamp, you now have the ability to put up music you have created and be paid for this music in Bitcoin instantly. SFX is essentially an alternative to SoundCloud, where users can upload audio clips and share with their friends and family. SFX had introduced Bitcoin tipping last December and with the acceptance of BoostVC, users now can now get paid in Bitcoin as well. This is a great move for SFX and in the end helps foster creativity by removing the restrictions on costly entry costs that come with traditional selling methods of music. There are many reasons this is a good thing, and SFX could become the next iTunes but for Bitcoin. One reason SFX\u2019s tweet is great news for Bitcoin users is because it shows that Bitcoin is being accepted once again by another industry. With most companies accepting Bitcoin coming from the e-commerce or electronic industry, it is refreshing that this time it is from the music industry. As more and more people realize that Bitcoins transaction speeds and unreversible transactions can benefit both the business and buyer, the more we will see Bitcoin used. For musicians just starting out and want to share their music with others but don\u2019t wish to share that music for free, SFX is a much better choice compared to the alternative route of listing your money on Itunes, for example, which has high costs compared to SFX. Due note that if your music has not received a single view in over six months, they will remove your music from their website. SFX is a great place to hear new talent because anyone can upload a song or sound clip and sell it, allowing visitors to listen and pay for music that they enjoy. Currently, SFX is in beta and with that being said there are going to be more features added to this website in the near future so be on the lookout. When listening to music, people do not want to wait for their music. They want it now, which is why we have seen music streaming services such as Spotify and Beats Music becoming increasingly popular. Its time that the payment options were just as fast too.

You can also work on many skills that allow you to make crafts that are an additional method to earn gold in Runescape. In this game, you collect gold and use that it to buy items like armor, potions, and weapons. Runescape has been around since 2001 and is still a popular game today. There are even Runescape trading websites such as D2jsp.org where you can trade items with other players. Jagex, the company who created Runescape, is now accepting Bitcoins after partnering with Bitpay.There is a large player base for Runescape; the player base is over 200 million players. Even if only 1% of users use Bitcoin to purchase in-game virtual items for Runescape, which is still a staggering 2 million people using Bitcoin. There is something David Parrot said that many people will use this new payment system simply because it is there and gives people an option to purchase with Bitcoin. David Parrott said it was \u201cnew and shiny\u201d which should be enough to generate interest in itself. Runescape is not the only game that is beginning to work with Bitcoin. Another game played by many, Minecraft, has a server that accept Bitcoins as well. The website making the Bitcoin Minecraft server is http://bitquest.co/, and it allows you to use Bitcoin in exchange for Emeralds, which are worth one bit. When you deposit Emeralds into an enchanted chest, they are exchanged for Bitcoin and transferred using the Xapo API. Microsoft recently started allowing people to buy XBOX games for Bitcoin, making it the largest company to date that accepts Bitcoin. For now it is not accepted for everything that Microsoft offers, just a small selection but that should change over the next couple months or so. On top of these announcements, Facebook, Spotify, and Ryanair could all begin to accept Bitcoin as well due to a Bitpay deal between Adyen and Bitpay. Adyen happens to also process payments for Jagex making it the first out of 3500 merchants that rely on Adyen for their payment processing. Adyen is based in Netherlands and processed $25 billion in transactions just in 2014 alone. They are now worth $1.5 billion thanks to a funding round where they raised an additional $250,000 for their business. With that being said, it\u2019s not long until more companies that rely on Adyen to follow suit and accept Bitcoin as well.

Currently Bitcoin trades as $221 on BTC-E. On January 24th, 2 days before the intermediate high, we wrote how micro trends with certain candle stick formations signaled an upcoming spike. This time, the sharp decline signals that the market is on its way to be squeezed down to the breakout area. The top 3 positions on tradingview are all SHORT positions.

Then, the price rises above the former peak and again declines. 3. And finally, rises again, but not to the second peak, and declines once more. According to investopedia: When we talk about trend reversals we must take into account the time frame that we are referring too. If we look at a 1 year char, a trend reversal has already shown itself a few weeks ago. However, when we look at the 2 week mark, it may see as if the upward pressure has disappeared and in its place a sleuth of bears has appeared. Furthermore, do not dismiss the possibility that the price may dive under this year\u2019s low which was $162 on January 14th. We are in the despair phase after China\u2019s bubble. Fear and panic might intermittently drive the price below the $200 mark. Recently, the mainstream has seemed to pickup on Bitcoin.

This \u201cprivate-key\u201d is needed to sign a transaction in order to send coins from one Bitcoin address to another. If another party acquires your private key through malicious activity, your Bitcoin wallet can be emptied out in a heartbeat. This is one of the most delicate parts of the Bitcoin software architecture and this precise security issue is where BitGo comes into the picture. BitGo aims to solve this security risk with a multi-signature (multi-key) approach. When you use BitGo to generate your wallet, instead of one private key being generated, the BitGo system will generate a total of three private keys. The first key will belong to the user, the second key will be kept by BitGo and the third key will be backed up offline in case there is a system failure on the part of BitGo or the user. In the BitGo system in order for the user to transfer Bitcoins from their wallet, the transaction will require two keys, the user\u2019s private key and the second key that was stored on BitGo\u2019s infrastructure. This system provides much better security to the user not only from hackers, but also from possible system failure on the part of the user because of the backed up third key! Considering how often hard drive failures occur \u2013 bitcointalk forum being a perfect example \u2013 it is a no brainer to use BitGo\u2019s system to keep your Bitcoin safely tucked away. It is also important to note that BitGo does not have control over the user\u2019s Bitcoin because they only hold one key, BitGo only acts as a secondary verification entity with their own key, remember, two keys are needed for a transfer to take place. So from a user\u2019s perspective a failure/hacking on either BitGo or the user will not compromise the Bitcoin that is held in a multi-sig wallet! BitGo will play an essential part in the Bitcoin ecosystem as it provides the security necessary for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies in general to adopted en masse by consumers and businesses alike. In the wake of several prominent Bitcoin heists such as the Bitstamp exchange hack where several million dollars worth of bitcoin were stolen by hackers, digital currency exchanges and many other Bitcoin related businesses have come to realize how indispensable multi-signature wallet systems like BitGo really are. BitGo also provides merchants and businesses the ability integrate their multi-signature wallet system via API (application programming interface). BitGo\u2019s API allows merchants to adopt Bitcoin without the tedious programming work necessary to secure their Bitcoin wallets. All it takes is a few lines of code and Presto, your business which was limited to regular currencies has now opened it\u2019s doors to the entire digital currency marketplace, how simple and innovative! BitGo\u2019s system will prove to be a major milestone for the worldwide embrace of Bitcoin as both a store of value and medium of exchange unrivaled at any time in the history of financial systems.

Soaring into the $200+ zones and dipping well below the $180 \u2013 prices, investors and traders alike have been taken aback by the erratic price movement. The prices of Bitcoin fell away during the start of the year. Positive news this year has been a rarity as thousands of Bitcoin users saw the price of Bitcoin drop like a stone. Breaking all supports of $200 and under the price went into free fall less than 24 hours digging further and further. However as bad as times may have been the recent price hike upwards has lightened spirits and has brought Bitcoin back into the upward swing. The reasons behind the recent price crash remain largely unknown as there have been a variety of causes pointed out. In our previous article we explored how Butterfly labs attempted to reimburse customers who were left out of pocket due to orders not being shipped out. The introduction of margin trading may be one of the causes of the recent price drop we have seen in Becton Pantera Capital \u2013 a bitcoin investment firm, wrote in a morning note. The recent price hike has meant that the losses encountered by the many have been recuperated to some degree. For those who purchased between $180 to $195 profits are to be taken during the recent price rise which has propped up Bitcoin price to over $211 but prices remain stable just under the support level of $200. The Bitcoin has also been recognised as one of the best investments of the year so far comparing against the likes of real currencies such as the Russian Ruble. The Russian Rouble was one of the worst performing currencies of the year whilst the bitcoin price rise and reduction in volatility compared to the previous year, Whilst the press surrounding Bitcoin may be negative market analysis clearly shows how the Bitcoin has allowed plenty of users to experience unparalleled financial freedom and allowed many traders to make a quick buck of the increasing volatility. Speculation Speculators have gone on a frenzy recently speculating on what was the cause of the crash and how far the bitcoin will go. Many assume the current market movement is simple price correction and is Bitcoin going to its true value whilst others see this quick recovery as a sign of a price rally. Judging by current market books it seems as if the last of the sub $200 coins have been bought and price will recover. To conclude the recent price movement may have been simply due to ButterFly labs dumping their coins to reimburse customers or a natural phase undertaken by the market to shake off weak hands. With speculators on the loose spinning theories of the prices hitting 10k or permabulls counting on another price crash the Bitcoin prices remain as wild as ever. Tomorrow can bring good news or bad but in reality no one can predict what bitcoin will have in store.", "date": "2015-01-16T18:54:49+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 1, "day": 16}

Initally starting up to allow only a handful of employees to receive their cheques in Bitcoin, the service has now opened its doors to the rest of the world allowing business and individuals to accept Bitcoin salaries anywhere in the world. As seen above the Bitwage project has expanded further into the eastern countries. This includes countries which have a less sophisticated financial system or where people do not have access to financial institutions. With the number of foreign workers in the US growing by the day currency has played a pivotal role in more and more lives. Whilst traditional services would charge huge fees to transfer funds between the US and the Philippines, Bitwage harnesses the power of Bitcoin to bring it at 0 cost (while the service is in the beta Phase, fees may be introduced once the service begins full time operation). As seen in the quote above the Coins.ph exchange has played a important role in bringing the Bitwage service all the way to the Philippines. The exchange will allow users of the Bitwage service to transfer funds using a variety of methods stated above and most importantly through the power of Bitcoin. The time frame in which funds are transferred are also dramatically shorter. Normal wire transfers may take up to 10 days but using Bitwage one can transfer funds in a matter of 2-3 days. More can be read on the Bitwage Blog. To conclude this new expansion in the service will help propel the Bitcoin to new levels. Allowing hundreds of employers to pay their workers with Bitcoin, the Bitwage service has allowed users all over the world to experience the true financial freedom provided by Bitcoin. The countless lives that will be touched with the introduction of the marvel are precious each and every one.

We have several reasons as to why the announcement tomorrow may be a something along the lines of a joke or something that can send Bitcoin and altcoin price to the moon. On close inspection the Coinbase Lunar page seems perfectly normal, in a puzzling way. It may be harbouring secrets or attempting to manipulate markets but in truth only time will tell as in under 24 hours all will be let out. However if a 24 hour wait is too long here are the results of a short investigation where some unexpected results were the least of our worries. Initially a skim of the source code was done. The source code is the one place most developers tend to place easter eggs and this case was no different As pointed out by Bitcoin Talk user XDan the code below : Leads to the following video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BROWqjuTM0g. This video was famously part of a meme referred simply as rick roll\u2019d, and the link leads the user on to a video where the Rick Roll is played for 10 hours straight. As if this was not puzzling enough the website still had more secrets to reveal. There have also been rumours in circulation that the announcement tomorrow may be a partnership reveal. Coinbase may have forged a alliance with a USD/BTC exchange as the webpage ambitiously predicts Bitcoin may be heading to the moon. As seen in the title the website reads, To the Moon but the picture placed directly in the centre depicts a Bitcoin flag on the moon. Surely this may be the foreshadowing of a price rally, but some have also put the announcement down as a troll or joke from Coinbase. The picture can be seen below courtesy of nikkihalbrook or can be viewed here. While the authenticity of these pictures may be questionable the pictures may provide a insight into Coinbase\u2019s next move. To conclude the Coinbase announcement tomorrow can bring good or bad news but with so much riding on one announcement tomorrow may be able to send Bitcoin to the moon as promised by the announcement page. With a trail of clues left behind the the devs and employees at Coinbase who knows what is planned to go off today. It may be the event that sets Bitcoin into another rally or it may be a troll but one things for sure the event will be worth watching as its not everyday a company dealing with millions take a secretive approach.

Bitcoin has been taking a steady ride down and into the murky depths of the sub $200 zone. With miners falling into a state of panic and shutting of their hashrate the number of new bitcoin produced is slowly declining. With small time miners pushed out of the game even big corporations are feeling the crunch of the current Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin has recently seen its name plastered across a whole host of big names including eBay and Microsoft but the huge exposure has not led to a huge price increase. Many blame this on loss of interest for the technology whilst many attribute the price plummet to a incoming price rally. However currently charts show the price is slowly gaining momentum and pushing past resistance at levels of $200- $205. The price of Bitcoin has recently shown small signs of recovery as the prices slowly stabilize around the $200 mark. When the prices dipped well below this support level, expected panic ensued. Once the price fell to $160 many believed bitcoin may as well be dead. Speculation The prices of Bitcoin are expected to recover by the end of the month considering strong market movement will be incoming. This has been hinted by the big events which occured including the million dollar funding round which finished earlier for Coinbase. With the volume also jumping slightly by the hour it is anticipated the market cap can rise to allow the prices of Bitcoin to recover to the $400 mark seen just a few months earlier. Currently Bitcoin price charts display price jumps and currently market price is around $224. This comes as a pleasant surprise for many as the majority of traders anticipated the price to remain at around $200 not breaking the $250 mark. To conclude the current market movement will bring out two very different opinions. Once from the pessimists who consider the low volume and small price movement to be a sign the ship is sinking. On the other hand many consider that the current market correction will allow for the price to recover doubling up to over $400, allowing a period of market growth. Everything is going for the Bitcoin, with real life adoption at its all time high, the price is bound to recover eventually. Whilst we are in the midst of a midlife crisis it is anticipated the price will go in the direction we all want it to, to the moon !

About six hours ago, BitcoinTalk.org suddenly stopped responding. Before any updates were posted, various schools of thought emerged as to what happened. The truth has been revealed, of course, but here were the speculations: Was it\u2026 Taken Offline? Earlier the bitcointalk twitter stated that they might be experiencing a DDOS attack Is the GAW team behind this one? They have been known to DDOS coinfire after their provocative SEC investigation post. Recently, a user by the name of WoodCollector was accused of running a scam of taking online jpeg vector images, running them through a laser engraver, engraving them on wood and claiming that the pieces are hand crafted, selling the for $14k a piece. Did he take some of his precious bitcoins and invest in a botnet ddos? Hacked? The forum is running a decently secure version of Simple Machines Forum (SMF) 1 with some custom code put into place to maximize security. Security breach bounties over the past few years have also helped to defend the forum\u2019s backend. It is possible, however, that an unknown attacker managed to accomplish the impossible \u2013 to penetrate the impenetrable \u2013 and work his or her way into the forum. From here, the attacker could have wrecked havoc. One speculated vector of attack is a most popular SQL injection, where a user could sing up with such a name which would trigger a table drop from the SQL database. One such example would be: Robert\u2019); DROP TABLE bitcoin.smf_members;\u2013 Here is a brief explanation of this attack by /u/physalisx: So far all we know is that BitcoinTalk.org\u2019s disks were corrupted, according to Twitter user @bitcointalk. BitcoinTalk.org\u2019s staff are working hard to resolve this issue. One issue that does seem to stick is the fact that bitointalk.org received over a million dollars of donations to support the forum, yet the forum software is archaic and now we also know that is is pretty vulnerable. The official bitcointalk twitter account @bitcointalk confirmed that the result of the downtime is a harddrive failure First of all, a RAID array is a nested set of normal RAID configurations, aka hybrid RAID. A normal RAID stands for redundant array of independent disks. It\u2019s purpose is to essentially combine more than one hard drive into one logical unit whose job would be data storage. Popular forums, Big corporations, Government agencies, all use RAID configuration to store their data in order to protect it. Bitcointalk.org is the most popular forum for the bitcoin community and had close to $1 million in donations sent to it. It comes to no surprise that it would run a nested RAID configuration. It was specifically running the RAID 1+0 configuration which looks like this and requires a minimum of 4 drives That looks pretty safe to me! However, could bitcointalk have done better? Here is an example of a RAID 50 array which requires a minimum of 6 drives Of you think that is not enough check out RAID 60 which requires at least 8 drives, now we are talking!

As a result, it explores the implications and provides an in-depth understanding of the emerging \u2018Networked Society.\u2019 The rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies is an indication of the early stages of the aforementioned Networked Society.\u2019 The recurring theme of cryptocurrencies not serves as a great backdrop for the research, but, also fulfills the purpose of evidence in this research. Originally published by Ericsson, the global leader in communications, the research was conducted in collaboration with Imperial College of London. The 44 page research report explores the amalgamation of information technology and financial services industry in great detail. It points out that although, the advancements in technology have so far been utilized to increase productivity within financial services industry, there\u2019s a change in trend. Digital technologies are now capable of disrupting the very foundation of the financial services industry. Before fully dwelling into cryptocurrencies, the report also gives an overview of mobile payment systems like M-Pesa. It is pointed out that new mobile payment systems only create a \u2018certain level of disruption\u2019 to the existing industrial structure. This is mainly because many of these payment systems offer an innovative and a cheaper solution to perform transactions. Yet, they still remain within the realms of existing financial system. It has been stated in the report that, due in part to the loss of trust in the existing financial system, a new system enabled by digital technology will emerge where the element of trust will be almost terminated. This new financial system will provide alternative solutions to the customers by allowing them to becoming their own banks. According to the research report, a digitally transformed financial system not only only holds the potential to disrupt banking or money, but the very basic foundations of society. From the roles of government in currency to how goods and services are valued and paid for. This newly transformed financial system is then compared to the existing Bitcoin payment network and an in-depth conclusion is drawn towards the end. In the conclusion, it has been highlighted that a \u2018significant transformation is emerging\u2019 through the use of cryptocurrencies. Throughout the research, a fair warning is given out to competitors and regulators.

Bitcoin has broken free of all market constraints and has managed to fall drastically in value of the period of lesst than 1 week. Whilst many traders will stare in despair as their holdings dwindle in value some will go out and take advantage of the current panic. As weak hands flail in wake of the price plummet those stronger and wiser traders will barely feel the blow of the market. If you are not in the know yet then carry on reading for some helpful tips to keep you going through these tough times. Firstly, margin/arbitrage trading. We wrote a article not long ago explaining the basics of margin trading and how this may help boost profits done in the right volumes. With increased levels of volatility being experienced in these rough periods margin trading is a tool used by many traders to maintain profits or manage losses. Whilst converting your Bitcoins to Fiat on any exchange such as Bitfinex, OKCoin will also help you avoid losses trading may help make profits, though it may be riskier. With prices dropping fast buying and selling bitcoins in a matter of minutes will help you skim the profits as prices rise or fall among the exchanges. Secondly, altcoins may feel like scams, PayCoin almost certainly was, but they also provide valuable opportunities to hedge funds. Investing your Bitcoin holdings into something that will perform whilst assuring safety and reliability. Altcoins may not be everyone\u2019s piece of cake and the worry of them turning rogue may unsettle even the hardest among you, but established and old cryptocoins such as litcoin, DarkCoin both have reasonably stable prices and dedicated communities. Pushing your Bitcoins into say DarkCoin may even yield a profit whilst had you left your coin untouched it may have performed worse. The most low risk way to preserve your bitcoins is to sell them directly on an exchange. Not withdrawing the the fiat but keeping it on the exchange. That way when the Bitcoin market\u2019s trend reverses you can quickly buy back into bitcoins. Thirdly using your analytic skills before firing off trades will help time trades squeezing profits out. As documented in a previous article the Elliot wave theory is just one theory that can be used to predict bitcoin prices. Whilst the overall trend may be downwards, there are breif hikes of relief and predicting these can be the difference between snagging some profit or missing out on an amazing opportunity. Relying on tried and tested methods and theories has helped many a trader keep afloat during dangerous times. Using online tools to predict bitcoin movement may not be a wise move as many are inaccurate or untrustworthy. To conclude there are various methods and strategies that can be used to soften the blow of the current bitcoin market. \u2018Hodling\u2019 may not be a option for many who may have brought during the peak in price, as every dollar down dictates a dollar lost. Trading may be a option available to many but definitely for the light heated who will sell at the first sight of a drop.

In June of 2012, Butterfly Labs became one of the first companies to announce a breakthrough in mining technology: application-specific integrated circuits, or \u201cASICs,\u201d designed specifically to mine bitcoin 1,000 times faster. Butterfly Labs promised their customers that preorders would ship as soon as possible. But they soon became evasive, issuing a series of shifting dates. In the end, many customers either received their shipment months later or did not receive it at all. By the time the ASICs were in the customer\u2019s hands their course had run through and they were no longer profitable. In total, more than 20,000 who paid for an ASIC never received their order. On November 4th, the FTC granted approval for Butterfly Labs to convert their bitcoin holdings to cash reserves in order to start refunding their customers. The court order said: According to the following analysis done by the user rockettilt on r/Bitcoin Butterfly Labs has atleast 94,000 bitcoins still in their possesion.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/5-tips-secure-bitcoin/", "author": "Mark", "title": "5 Basic Tips to Secure Your Bitcoins", "content": "Compromises of Bitcoin exchanges such as Mt. Gox, which took place in early 2014 and the Bitstamp compromise which resulted in the loss of around 18,000-19,000 bitcoins has not gone down well with the users. We know that Bitcoin is completely anonymous and at the same time it is very transparent due to the Blockchain. Hence it is very difficult to get back the bitcoins that were stolen. This calls for strong measures to be taken by the users of bitcoin to secure their wallets. Why? A recent research has revealed that a majority of the malware nowadays contain bitcoin stealing capabilities. In fact, there are nearly 150 breeds of malware whose sole purpose is to steal Bitcoins. All of this calls for a strong measure to secure your bitcoins. Here a few basic but vital tips. 1. Use multi signature wallets This makes it very difficult for the black hat hackers to have the ability of sending your bitcoins to their addresses. For example, a wallet has a total number of keys, say \u201cx\u201d and you need to sign \u201cy\u201d number of keys to sign a transaction and approve it. Only when \u201cy\u201d number of keys is signed, the transaction will be executed. This method is very useful especially for companies and for people who are the co-founders, or have a large leadership in your organization. You can form a group who will perform the financial transactions and every time a transaction has to be executed, all the members of the group will have to sign the transaction. Hence, the hacker needs to obtain access to each employees computer/device to be able to steal the bitcoins, otherwise they will be safe. 2. Encrypt your wallet This will prove to be yet another hurdle for the hacker in case he is able to illegally access your wallet. Make sure your password is long enough and it contains uppercase and lowercase characters. In addition to this, you should also consider using a password generator. 3. Use a strong password and a keystroke scrambler This will make it pretty difficult for hackers to gain access to your wallet but you should also be sure that you install a keystroke scrambler because if your computer gets infected by a remote administration tool or a keylogger, your keystrokes can easily be logged and the hacker can gain access to your wallet. Hence, it is necessary to install a keystroke scrambler on your computer. 4. Regular Backups Make it a habit to maintain regular backups in various locations and don\u2019t forget to make sure that the location is secure. If you store the backups online, please make sure that the backups are encrypted. 5. Cold Storage In simple terms, cold storage means storing your bitcoins offline, which means that your bitcoins will be stored on a computer which is not connected to the internet. This will prevent your wallet from being compromised, which usually happens due to the internet(RAT\u2019s, keyloggers etc). There are many methods to implement cold storage such as using Armory(wallet client) on a computer that is not connected to the internet or using hardware wallets such as trezor, which costs $119. You can also use paper wallets but they must be handled with utmost safety.

Satoshi Nakamoto set out to deliver and in this dream he launched a complete currency that stands strong (ish) to this day. Having risen from values of 1 cent a coin the cryptocurrency now stands at $300 +. Bitcoin may have started out as a simple experiment or it may be the vision of a cashless and decentralized future economy. Bitcoin has helped bring into existence a huge variety of other cryptocurrencies. From the likes of PayCoin to revolutionaries such as LiteCoin. With cryptology taking leaps and bounds lets have a look at 5 of the cryptocoins that started of the altcoin rush. 1) RippleCoin was one of the first coins to come into existence after the launch of Bitcoin. Although Ripple was born 2 years after Bitcoin the inception of Ripple provided a new spin on crypto. The RippleCoin combined all of the positives of Bitcoin, such as its financial capabilities and flexibility, and introduced a more powerful financial management. With a complete financial plan outlined by Ripple, the coin boasted the concept of an international economy. 2)Next in the time line of Crypto, NameCoin was launched. On the 18th of April 2011 the genesis block was mined and the start of one of the first cryptocoins was sealed. NameCoin introduced the first alternative chain and with merged mining in place the coin has become one of the most popular cryptocurrencies of the present. Whilst it may not have one of the highest market caps the coin has boasted a dedicated development team and an awesome community definitely one to check out. 3) Next comes a coin which has fallen under the shadows. Tenebrix, a name you may not be familiar with but is one that is particularly revolutionary. Named the first every scrypt coin the coin has given way to countless other coins based on the revolutionary algorithm. ASIC proof and future proof the coin is still well and alive since its early launch of 25 September 2011. It may be ancient but the \u201ccpu friendly and gpu hostile\u201d currency maintains a full functioning network so if you want to play around with the currency then be my guest. 4) Not soon after the launch of Tenebrix, Litecoin launched, Labeled as a Tenebrix coin the coin the LiteCoin was the first coin to propel the scrypt algorithm to new heights. Launched on the 7th of October the coin has one of the highest present market caps of over $80 million. Scrypt has come a long way but Litcoin has established itself as a spiritual successor. 5)Finally, on our journey we come across ByteCent. The currency may seem just another altcoin but it was the first ever one to put into use the cryptonight algorithm. The coin has fallen prey of time, as the technology improved so did the altcoin markets. The cryptonight algorithm first pioneered by ByteCent has been left as the legacy of the coin. The list was built using a few parameters but is designed to inform you of 5 of the earliest developed cryptocoins. Of Course favorites such as DogeCoin, DarkCoin and PeerCoin are in the top ten.

Ever since the start of this bear market, TA pundits and chart readers have been calling the penetration of the $260 area to be a sign of an impending doom which may lead to sub $150 prices. It is now clear that market is infiltrating in a very dangerous zone receptive of real panic among traders. Market participants have been desperately anticipating a sign of trend reversal but is this final capitulation? No one knows for sure. All About Right Timing Prices were hovering around $310-320 range at the beginning of the week 12/29. It\u2019s important to notice that during this time most parts of the world were celebrating New Years and spending time with family except \u2013 China. While every other major financial market has no trading activity during the weekend, Bitcoin is famous for its notorious drops during the weekend or at least since the last 13 months. Chinese traders knew they couldn\u2019t drop the prices and instill a capitulation among Western traders until holidays festivities were over. This becomes evident with the sideways movement through the week and then a sudden 13% drop on 1/3 at the start of 2015. With markets closing around $280 on BitStamp and touching a low of $277, charts indicated a further drop. However, trading activity once again resume to sideways movements at the beginning of Western session on 1/4 with markets trading between $278 to $289 on BitStamp. As I write this post from Asia, the West is waking up. During the last three hours, while the West was tucked in their beds, Bitcoin markets lost another 9% during the last three hours. Western traders will be watching a big drop of 9% from $281 to $255 and this will lead towards the final bloodshed. Has there been any negative news during this time period? No. Is there anything wrong with the underlying Bitcoin protocol? Perhaps a recently discovered security flaw? No. So, what possible reason can be associated with this sudden drop into the high 200s? It\u2019s all about timing. Yes, one could argue about the supply side of Bitcoin and how there isn\u2019t enough demand. But, the end of Bear markets are vicious in nature.

Paired with the political woes of the currently fiat money has devastated the Russian economy. Many speculators believe the Bitcoin is the perfect currency to replace the Ruble but the first ever Bitcoin festival in Russia will act as the first step toward mass Bitcoin adoption through out the country. The festival has already amassed more than a dozen sponsers including Merchant Coin and BitBasket. As noted in our previous article Bitcoin conferences/festivals do have the tendancy to lean to one side and be manipulated. However CoinFest strives to make this festival an oppurtunity to educate and entertain as the festival claims to be non-profit. The ideas behind CoinFest are also experimental but extremely interesting as the festival can be had anywhere which accepts alternative currencies. The CoinFest is literally open source allowing it to be celebrated in a wide variety of places. Starting in a small coffee house the festival is now a national event with a whole host of establishments taking part. The festival has also taken things into its own hands as it has made it clear all organizers of the event are barred from using bank accounts. In the true spirit of cryptocurrency the festival prides itself as being completely reliant on crypto to get it running. The organizers are attached to crypto and the visitors will also be expected to use crypto and the use of fiat currency will not be allowed anywhere except when buying crypto, according to the website. As seen above the festival prides itself for embodying the same decentralized nature as cryptocurrencies. With a central authority eventually being removed the festival aims to display the true nature of cryptocurrencies and will educate and entertain its visitors. The dates have been fixed, 20-22 February 2015, for CoinFest where the bulk of exhibitions will be unveiled in various locations primarily located in Russia. The event however has not put into place a rigid agenda so all remains a mystery till now. I hope to see you at the CoinFest but as always stay tuned to BTCFeed for all the exclusive Bitcoin news.", "date": "2015-01-03T21:40:48+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 1, "day": 3}

With the prices casually slipping reducing the bitcoins value bit by bit many have lost faith speculating a complete crash to hit the Bitcoin. Whilst it may be true that the bitcoin markets are currenct bearish, the future holds much to be desired in terms of bitcoin. Many speculate a short but worthwhile bull run to occur mid January. With the holiday season well and truly over, the scene has been set for the markets. With fewer consumers trading in the bitcoins for fiat, the chances of a bull run are higher than ever as the interest in bitcoin slowly surges with buy orders helping to keep the price stable across many exchanges. The previous year had seen plenty of advance in the general adoption of the digital currency with behemoths such as microsoft jumping on the boat. This would have prompted slight increases of the value of Bitcoin, unfortunately Bitcoin failed to respond to any of these events. With the bulk of vendors not accepting Bitcoin entirely, they simply dumped Bitcoin payments sent to the in favor of fiat. How ever with the new year already in full swing, with all advance in adoption already done, the price of bitcoin can finally recover. Graphs displaying the price of bitcoin already show the beginnings of a premature bull run. With the short price hike experienced earlier prices have been able to maintain a stable figure. This market movement may be the beginnings of the bull run speculated by many due to rhe similarities it shares with many other altcoins. Also with resistance at a minimum and an established support level of 300, Bitcoin has all in its favor at the moment. Regular readers of the site may have read a previous article detailing the Elliot wave theory which was used in conjunction with the markets. The theory used in a range of various either markets was also put into practice on the bitcoin markets and a conclusion was drawn. A trend reversal was due and the January rally coincides. More on the Elliot wave theory can be read here. Surfing the next bull run will be essential for many traders who have encountered losses over the past year. It is wise to give out a preemptive warning that trading has its own risks involved. The bull run is likely to occur at a steady but fast pace and studying graphs suggests that the bull run may come sooner than expected. Getting in early is key to maximizing profits but waiting for a slow but sure rise will secure your funds. Jumping at the first sight of a price hike may see you miss out on the bulk of market movement. To conclude the upcoming weeks will be essential to the value of Bitcoin as it seems as if the moment to make or break bitcoin has made its appearance.", "date": "2015-01-01T22:01:56+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 1, "day": 1}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/not-attend-miami-bitcoin-conference/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Why you should not attend the Miami Bitcoin Conference", "content": "Conferences are held in order to increase awareness about an idea, educate people, and share ongoing research. The upcoming Bitcoin conference in Miami is going to take place on January 16th and is the 4th Bitcoin conference to take place in north america. The current price for a ticket is $150 and you can buy it from http://btcmiami.com/ It has come to our attention that the CEO of Gaw Miners \u2013 a known scam Josh Garza, is going to be speaking at the conference. What is even more troubling is that PayBase \u2013 which is also owned by Josh is a premier sponsor for the conference. There are two major problems with PayBase being a premiere sponsor. First, by displaying PayBase logos and ads throughout the bitcoin conference btcmiami is creating false reassurance that PayBase is a legitimate company which should be trusted. Secondly, it shows just how little morals exists in the bitcoin industry if the conference organizers would rather sell out and pocket more cash from these events instead of educating the community about the benefits and upcoming features of bitcoin. Just look at the other premier sponsors of the event. Factom is a startup which solves a real problem in the bitcoin network \u2013 the large size of the blockchain (a few gigabytes). PerkinsCoie is a law firm which represents companies and helps them with legal issues Last but not least we all know bitpay \u2013 one of bitcoin\u2019s top and most reputable startups which plays a major part in merchant adoption of bitcoin. PayBase just does not belong. It does nothing to help the bitcoin currency or community, it has no new innovation and no new features. The bitcoin community has clearly expressed their opposition to letting Josh Garza speak at the conference. Unfortunately, money is the name of the game and Moe Levin who is the organizer for the event refused to redact Josh from the list of speakers. Instead he added an extra 30 minutes for Q&A after Josh\u2019s speech. What\u2019s even more astounding is the fact that Moe Levin decided to turn the situation around and try to profit from all the drama regarding PayBase and Josh Garza. His post on reddit suggests that those that have concerns regarding Josh should \u201cmake their voice heard\u201d. Essentially by adding an extra 30 minutes of Q&A it creates an incentive to buy a ticket just so you can \u201cmake your voice heard\u201d during the Q&A session. The best way to \u201cmake your voice heard\u201d is by not buying a ticket, not attending the conference and making the room look like the picutre above during Josh Garza\u2019s speech. Do you think that adding 30 minutes for a Q&A is a fair compromise? Do you think PayBase should be removed from the sponsors list and the money that was given to the conference organizers returned back to PayBase? Comment below.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/how-to-arbitrage-bitcoin/", "author": "Mark", "title": "How to Arbitrage Bitcoin", "content": "Basically, Bitcoin arbitrage is the act of buying Bitcoin at an exchange where the price is very low and selling it at a different exchange where the price is relatively higher. This act is widely practiced in many stock markets but it is not very profitable, reasons being: low profit margins. Because stock markets are very advanced compared to Bitcoin exchanges, the difference of prices in different markets is very small. It is not profitable unless you have a lot of money to practice arbitration. Bitcoin has a public ledger called the blockchain which verifies each transaction, it usually takes time for a transaction to be confirmed if you want to arbitrage between two exchanges, it is going to take time. If you find out that the price of Bitcoin in BTC-e was $265 and the price of Bitcoin in Bitstamp is $275, and you decide to arbitrage between BTC-e and Bitstamp, you would need to buy Bitcoins in BTC-e and you would also need to transfer them to your Bitstamp account which needs a certain amount of confirmations in the blockchain to be credited into your account. This can take time but even if it takes 10 minutes, the price can change rapidly and hence, you would lose your opportunity to arbitrage. Well, this is very simple, you need have funds in both your accounts, that is BTC-e and Bitstamp so that you can immediately buy Bitcoins and sell them. You need to fund your account well in advance because The second thing to take into consideration for Bitcoin arbitrage is fees, which also plays a crucial role. Different exchanges charge different amount of fees. BTC-e charges 0.2% and bitstamp charges 0.2% to 0.5% depending on the value of your monthly trade volume. Since you\u2019re going to trade on two exchanges, you need to deduct fees in order to calculate your profits. If the difference between the prices is less than 1%, it is not worth doing arbitrage. You need to have a decent margin in order to practice arbitrage and manage a profit. For example, in case 1, if you had $3000 in your BTC-e account and $3000 in your Bitstamp Account, and you buy 11 Bitcoins in BTC-e at the rate of $265 each Buying in BTC-e 11 * 265 = $2915 Fees= 0.2% Therefore, 0.2% of $2915 = $5.83 So, total amount spent = $2920.83 Selling on Bitstamp 11 * 275 = $3025 Fees (the fee varies depending on your volume, but lets take 0.5% for the sake of ease of calculations and understanding) = 0.5% Therefore, 0.2% of $3025 = $15.125 Therefore, $3025 \u2013 $15.125 = $3009.875 Therefore, net profit => $3009.875 \u2013 $2920.83 = $89.045 Alright, so if you identify nice opportunities to arbitrage Bitcoin, this would be a lucrative way to make money but, there are many more factors such as the money transfer into the exchange. For excmple, Mt. Gox had stopped the USD withdrawals for users and many exchanges take time to credit the money sent into your exchange and you need to verify your account in order to trade, which requires varied documents and proofs such as a passport. But you must be cautioned that while arbitrage is a nice way of making money, it is not really profitable always. A better option would be to buy a trading bot and practice arbitrage. The biggest challenge for traders is that arbitrage needs a lot of money to make decent profits. Otherwise, it won\u2019t really be profitable. Overall, arbitrage with trade bots is much more profitable and reliable and once you get to know your way through the markets, you will surely make a decent amount out of it.

The challenge\u2019s goal is to bring a total of 2,000 meals to the homeless, and this can be easily accomplished by donating $1.95 in bitcoin, which is the price for one meal.

By storing your private keys offline on a piece of hardware you eliminate the possibility of malware stealing your bitcoins. The wallet is so secure, that even if your machine is compromised, the provided security card renders the attack useless. For a cheap price of $50 the Ledger Nano makes a great gift for any bitcoin enthusiast and makes a great alternative to the Trezor which is priced at $99 or the Keep Key wallet which is priced at $239. Check out this video showing the unboxing of the Ledger Nano Duo Edition: Step 1: Plug in the Ledger Nano wallet into the usb port of your computer Step 2: If you don\u2019t have the Chrome browser download an install Chrome Step 3: Go to http://my.ledgerwallet.com and install the Ledger Wallet App Step 4: Follow the instructions to configure your new Ledger Wallet When setting up your pincode you can either use the automatically generated pin, or use a manual pin (make sure it is not your birth year or your last 4 credit card numbers) Confirm your newly created PIN code Write down the recovery phrase shown in each of the 24 boxes onto the corresponding 24 boxes on your recovery sheet.

When you unlock your wallet your will be presented with an intuitive GUI similar to that of Electrum or Bitcoin Core. The difference is a much higher security because of the physical security card. Your average bitcoin wallet uses a simple password to sign the transaction and send the coins. A MITM (man in the middle) attack can hijack that password or even worse, a piece of malware such as a keylogger on your machine can log the password and steal all your coins. The physical security card provides an 2FA security feature which is unbreakable by any piece of malware on your computer or any other online based attack.

In most cases, a warning will be shown on the website detailing the reason this blockade has been put in place, but that is not always the case. A new HTTP status code has been introduced, designed specifically to indicate the website in question has been blocked due to legal implications. Also read: Is Renewable Energy The Future of Bitcoin Mining? After approval of the new HTTP 451 status code by the Internet Engineering Steering Group, websites blocked for legal reasons will now be labelled with this error code. In fact, HTTP 451 will provide Internet users with valuable insights as to how online censorship is enforced as well. Up until this very moment, Internet censorship has been rather difficult to quantify, as it was not always clear why certain websites were restricted, and others were not. The 451 Unavailable group drafted the proposal for a separate HTTP status code to indicate this type of online censorship, which has now been approved. But there is more to HTTP 451 than just being a status code itself< Internet service providers and web developers will be able to use this new standard to provide additional information regarding the unavailability of certain websites. Do keep in mind this feature is an optional, although we can only hope the involved parties make use of this solution in a transparent manner. The new 451 status code will replace the previous \u201cError 403: Forbidden\u201d messages when it comes to access a blocked or deleted website. Status code 403 was never intended to be used for this purpose, as it creates a confusing message for Internet users. That issue should be rectified with the new HTTP 451 code in the near future. For those people wondering why this new HTTP status code carries the number 451, it is a reference to the book \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d. This particular book details how certain literature is forbidden, and how censorship is enforced on a large scale. Choosing the same number to create an HTTP 451 status code is very fitting in that regard. Despite this approval, implementation of HTTP 451 is voluntarily and entirely dependant on web developers willing to use this new standard. After all, certain governments may not want to disclose the exact reason certain websites are taken offline, and stick to the traditional \u201c403: Forbidden\u201d message.

Currently MAID is not only below the 0.000038 level but it is also below the 0.000034 level which held for a week.

On the other hand, you never know when whales might exit the market and cause a panic similar to the one in November. Currently, MAID is trading at 0.00003105 after rebounding at the 0.00003 support level from the 13% drop. For more information about MAID visit their forum or blog.

I outlined the technical importance of this pivot zone in my last ETH technical analysis, and it seems that this level is now an even bigger battle ground. Although there hasn\u2019t been enough buyers to surmount 0.00215, the 0.002 level is also now acting as support, so the market is currently sandwiched between those two pivots. The 0.002 area has acted as support/resistance several times since the sell-off on the 17th, so this area is just as important as the pivot at 0.00215. Besides the two pivot zones I outlined above; there is no clear indication as to which way the market is leaning, however, the 30-minute chart is showing a triangle formation. These types of narrowing trading ranges usually indicate an accumulation of pressure. The sell-off on the 17th was preceded by a very similar pattern.

The 1-hour chart shows that $3.65 has been used as resistance on two occasions, and another four times as support between the 15th and 16th. Litecoin\u2019s exchange rate is currently trapped between $3.65 \u2013 $3.75. If we take a more broad view of the price action since the 11th of December, it becomes fairly obvious that the market has been trading in a progressively narrowing range. A triangle formation is clearly visible on the 1h/2h/4h charts. Triangle formations very often resolve themselves with violent breaks. A good example of this is the recent triangle pattern on Ethereum, which broke to the downside. Disclaimer: This is not trading/investment advice!

Despite going through a ban by Apple and being reinstated shortly afterwards, SaruTobi has become a very popular mobile game for Bitcoin community members. A new update has been announced, as the game incorporated Counterparty. Also read: Will Kenya Be The Next Bitcoin Hub? Similar to how Bitcoin operates, there is a fixed limit to the amount of Sarutobi Coin that will be in existence. In fact, the total supply is exactly the same as Bitcoin\u2019s and capped at 21 million Counterparty tokens. But there is much more to this new in-game \u201ccurrency\u201d than just being a novelty item. Unlike most Counterparty-based tokens, there will be no investment round for Sarutobi coin. Instead, the only way to obtain this token is by donating Bitcoin to the game developer, who will then issue a certain amount of tokens to your address. The donated amount in Bitcoin will be re-used in the game itself to pay out user balances when they ask for a withdrawal. Some people might be wondering what the use of this Counterparty token is, and the answer to that is quite simple. Owners of the SaruTobi token will be eligible for rewards in the future \u2013 although nothing has been confirmed yet \u2013 which could include Spells of Genesis cards or other Bitcoin-related goodies. What makes this Counterparty token so interesting is how the SaruTobi developer used the IndieSquare wallet app to get things organized. This project acts as tipping tool, which is attempting to challenge the traditional ad revenue model. Some people might know this under the name \u201cTipMe TipYou\u201d. It will be interesting to see whether or not SaruTobi players decide to donate some Bitcoin in exchange for this counterparty token. Regardless of whether they are interested in the token itself, all of the donated funds will be returned to the players in the long run, which is the main thing to keep in mind.

In fact, there is a lot of confusion as to how blockchain.info must be the actual Bitcoin blockchain while it is just a visual representation of the network itself. The recent Android wallet update rolled out by the company is not winning over many people either, although the new design has certain advantages. Also read: Bitcoin Mixing Services Pose Certain Risks Part of the most recent Blockchain.info Android Bitcoin wallet update focuses on the redesign of the application itself. Whereas the app previously looked rather bland and boring, the new design is more user-friendly and pleases the eye. Gone are the square buttons, as they have been replaced with circles. Another change to the Blockchain.info Android wallet is how the pin validation process seems to run a lot smoother compared to previous versions. Opening up the wallet now happens in the blink of an eye, rather than waiting for a few seconds to load. That is, assuming the service is not down for maintenance or server issues, but we\u2019ll get to that later. The general UI of the Blockchain.info wallet has been redesigned as well, to look more \u201cstreamlined\u201d rather than just presenting a palette of slabs and blocks. The previous version of this wallet felt a bit Spartan in its look and feel, but the newer version is a lot more inviting to both novice and experienced users. Plus, the transaction overview has been revamped as well and looks very familiar to most online banking interfaces. Additionally, the developers have added a neat Map feature to find Bitcoin merchants and retailers near you. While this feature works quite smooth, the map does need some updates, as the list of locations seems to be outdated a bit. Luckily, users can add new locations to the map, which will lead to a more updated overview down the line. Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks to this update as well, depending on what type of Android Bitcoin wallet user one might be. There is still no word on enabling hierarchical deterministic wallet support, a feature that has been requested by a multitude of users for quite some time now. In fact, it remains unclear as to whether or not this feature will ever make it to the Blockchain.info wallet. Custom spending has also been removed from the Blockchain.info Android wallet \u2013 or so it seems at last \u2013 which is not something many users will appreciate. Furthermore, the new release still has its occasional crashes and bugs on Android 5.1, which should not happen in the first place. Another thing that has been removed is the fiat value of every Bitcoin transaction at the time of being broadcasted. Granted, this feature has always been a bit buggy at best, but it was a nice addition for those among us who make a living paid in Bitcoin. Looking up the exact values is not a major annoyance, but it\u2019s a shame to see such a useful feature removed completely. What are your thoughts on this Blockchain.info Android wallet update?

A new transaction network based on blockchain technology will be developed by IBM and Wells Fargo, as well as London Stock Exchange Group Plc. By uniting forces with the Linux Foundation, the goal is to create a public network on which blockchain applications can be built to communicate with each other. Also read: Target Wish List App Vulnerable To Data Hijacking As part of this collaborative project, IBM will contribute tens of thousands of lines of existing code to this new project, and put several dedicated developers on the concept. Additionally, IBM will also share some of its intellectual property with the Linux Foundation and Wells Fargo to make this blockchain-based transaction network a success. Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin stated: It is no secret the blockchain is capable of transforming business and finance as we know it, especially considering how intertwined both of the latter sectors are. Blockchain technology can process nearly any type of money transfer or trade in a matter of minutes, rather than waiting several days for transactions to complete. Truth be told, there are quite a few big names in the financial industry partaking in this project. CLS, the largest cash settlement system in the currency market, as well as Swift, are both participating in this plan to revolutionize the financial ecosystem by using blockchain technology. But it\u2019s not just the financial industry who wants to shake things up, as there is a massive interest from tech titans as well. Companies like Cisco, Intel, Digital Asset Holdings LLC, and others, are all part of this new initiative, by dedicating manpower, resources, and code to the project. Adopting blockchain technology is a major speed boost for financial transactions, as settlement and clearing can be reduced to a handful of seconds. However, without proper communication between parties, that process will not be fully streamlined. That is why this new blockchain consortium wants to focus their attention on communicative blockchain-based applications. Whenever someone talks about the blockchain, most people will think of Bitcoin. Combining a distributed ledger with user privacy and a decentralized money supply has intrigued quite a few people over the years. So much even that traditional financial players are flocking to blockchain technology in an attempt to modify Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem into something that works for them. This new initiative by both financial and tech giants is another step along the way to bring blockchain technology \u2013 and perhaps even Bitcoin \u2013 to mainstream consumers in the years to come. There is no better time than now to be involved in digital currency or its technology, as exciting things are bound to happen very soon.

However, most people prefer to use WordPress or similar free blogging solutions, and Joomla is hardly ever mentioned. That is until a critical security flaw is discovered by researchers. At the time of publication, hackers were actively exploiting one of Joomla\u2019s critical vulnerabilities, which has been present in the platform\u2019s source code for nearly eight years now. It does not happen often that a vulnerability exists for so long, although it remained undiscovered until very recently. Even though Joomla engineers recently released a security patch to fix the vulnerability, the damage had already been done. Hackers have been exploiting the Joomla vulnerability for a little while, as attacks started last Saturday and continued all throughout Sunday. Security firm Sucuri reported a few hundred exploit attempts over the course of 48 hours. As one would come to expect, the number of attacks against Joomla sites increased exponentially once word got out about this vulnerability. Every single Joomla site was \u2013 and still is \u2013 a target for hackers unless the owner has installed the most recent security update in the past 36 hours. What makes matters, even more, worrying is how it remains unclear as to what this exploit can do to Joomla-based websites. When content management systems are vulnerable to attack, just about anything can happen. More details are expected to be revealed in the near future, though. Do you run a website based on Joomla?

When personal information is leaked, however, things take a turn for the worst. Target\u2019s wish list application is not safe from harm by the look of things, as a fair amount of customer details have been made public. As a result, part of the app\u2019s features have been suspended for the time being. Also read: Can Companies Simplify The Conversion From Bitcoin To Fiat Currency? What makes wish list applications so interesting is how consumers can put together an overview of items they would like to receive during the year. With the holiday season almost upon us, finding that perfect gift for loved one can prove to be quite a challenge. Thanks to Target\u2019s wish list app, that job has become slightly easier. Unfortunately, the Target wish list application is not keeping customer information safe, which can be attributed to some sloppy coding along the way. In fact, Avast security researchers noted how the app database is storing the information in such a way that it becomes publicly accessible once you figure out the app\u2019s programming interface. To make matters even worse, that programming interface is publicly available. In fact, obtaining the information stored in this database can be achieved by using the API, which only requires a \u201cquestion\u201d as a condition to return information. Once an assailant figures out how the user\u2019s ID is generated, they have access to names, addresses, and email addresses. Not the kind of information one wants out in the open. Target has not officially responded to this discovery, although one of their spokeswomen stated how certain elements of the application have been disabled for the time being. Engineers and developers are looking at the application\u2019s source code, and a security update will be released in the near future. There is always a certain tradeoff to be made in these types of applications, as some will require a lot of unnecessary permissions whereas others are making information too accessible to the public. Companies really have to step up their game if they want to develop proper applications that are not invading user privacy while still protecting customer data at the same time. One positive thing to note is how no financial data has been stolen from Target users. Even though the wish list app stores a lot of sensitive information, financial details are not among them [\u2666as far as we know]. While this is somewhat of a relief, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that Target\u2019s app is leaking on all sides. This is why Bitcoin is a far more superior method of payment, as there is no vital information that can be leaked at any time. In the worst case scenario, the user\u2019s Bitcoin wallet address is obtained, but an attacker can\u2019t do anything with that unless they obtained the private key associated with that wallet.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/five-reasons-why-apple-pay-is-not-a-success-and-bitcoin-is-better/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Five Reasons Why Apple Pay is Not A Success", "content": "Mobile payments are getting a lot of mainstream attention, as they allow everyday consumers to make payments in a far more convenient manner. Despite the early adoption of solutions such as Apple Pay, very few people are effectively using mobile payments right now. When even one of the biggest companies in the world can\u2019t make consumers appreciate mobile payment solutions, things are looking quite good for Bitcoin. Also read: Prizerebel Now Pays Out In Bitcoin Through SNAPCARD One of the major misconceptions regarding Apple Pay is how this is not a new form of payments by any means. Apple Pay uses old, defunct payment systems such as plastic cards, and combines it with [somewhat] new technology. While this combination is a slightly more convenient way of paying, the same restrictions apply regarding participating banks and upgraded payment terminals. By storing such sensitive financial data on a mobile device, the question became whether or not Apple was doing enough to encrypt payment details. For quite some time, the company refused to comment on how they were protecting financial data, which caused a lot of concern and frustration among Apple Pay users in the early days. But that is not the only issue Apple Pay is facing, as the service still doesn\u2019t accept every individual plastic card in the US. Part of this depends on participating banks, and whether or not the card is officially listed as \u201ccompatible\u201d. Despite all of that, users are regularly faced with cards that can\u2019t be added to the mobile payment solution for some unknown reason. Solutions like Apple Pay will stand or fall based on retailer adoption. Before a merchant can accept Apple Pay, they will need to upgrade the payment terminals, which brings forth an additional cost. For smaller businesses, this cost cannot be justified, and even larger businesses are not seeing the value in Apple Pay in its current state. Last but not last, Apple Pay transactions can get declined randomly without any proper indication as to why this is happening. Swiping the physical card during checkout will work in most cases, only adding to the mysterious workings of Apple Pay itself. As a result, a fair few consumers will stop using this buggy mobile payment solution altogether, and stick to plastic cards for the time being. Unlike Apple Pay, Bitcoin offers a completely different experience. Since there is no meddling by banks nor any payment terminals to upgrade, Bitcoin is an open ecosystem anyone can enter without additional costs. However, just like Apple Pay, Bitcoin adoption is rather slow, and it will take some time before it becomes a mainstream form of payment. However, from the look of things, Bitcoin has a better chance of being embraced by mainstream consumers, compared to Apple Pay or any other mobile payment alternative. Because digital currency does not rely on banks or central institutions, it can be used anywhere in the world at any given time, without exchange rates or different fee structures to worry about.

While the official word is that the site is under DDoS, and hardware upgrades are being implemented to cope with the growing demand, a lot of Bitcoin community members feel this exchange is turning into a new Mt.Gox. After all, users can still deposit funds to Cryptsy, but withdrawing has not been possible for quite some time now. Also read: Microsoft Enables Carrier Billing For Windows Store \u2013 Bitcoin Integration Soon? One thing to keep in mind when getting involved in the world of Bitcoin and digital currency is that any funds spent from one\u2019s wallet are non-refundable. This means that, if one were to send a few Bitcoins to anyone else on the network, there is no way of getting that money back if things go awry. This scenario is especially true when it comes to using digital currency exchanges, as nearly all of them will act as an intermediary to hold customer funds. Whenever a problem arises with one of these exchanges regarding getting money out again, people should instantly stop depositing more funds into the platform. Cryptsy, which is the example exchange in this story, also has the responsibility to stop people from depositing funds until they have all of their issues sorted. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case, which only leads to more frustration and speculation regarding what is going on with the platform. Trouble started brewing for Cryptsy when a Twitter post mentioned a server failure, pausing all wallets active on the cryptocurrency exchange. This was back on November 22nd, and everything was scheduled to be resumed very shortly. However, that issue never got sorted, and things have only gotten worse from there on out. Two days later, Cryptsy\u2019s BigVern posted a message saying how the website was offline due to a denial-of-service attack. At that time, the wallet situation hadn\u2019t been resolved yet, and a lot of platform users started getting worried. Getting funds out of Cryptsy\u2019s wallet was \u2013 and still is \u2013 impossible at that time. Over the past few weeks, things had quieted down on the Cryptsy front, with no updates whatsoever. That was, until December 10, when another Twitter update was posted to \u201cthank everyone for their patience, and the team is working hard\u201d. Not a message anyone is really happy with it, albeit it is an update of some sorts. The big question is how the situation will evolve over the next few weeks. We can only hope that Cryptsy customers will be able to get their funds out sooner rather than later, but there does not seem to be any indication of that being the case anytime soon. For now, everyone will have to rely on sparse Twitter updates, and hope for the best. That being said, Cryptsy can rest assured their already shaky reputation has taken a major blow because of these issues. In the Bitcoin world, it is not acceptable to hold customer funds hostage for such an extended period of time, without any proof of what has happened, or being done, to rectify the issue.

Banks are struggling to keep up with the growing demand for convenient services, and internal errors are alienating customers from their brand. Barclays, one of the largest banks in the world, mistakenly put out a fraud alert against one of its customers, preventing him from taking out credit, secure a mobile phone contract, or even move banks. Also read: Russia Launches Own Credit Rating Agency \u2013 Door Is Wide Open For Bitcoin In most cases, the tight-knit relationship between major banks and other companies is a positive thing for all parties involved. Providing a credit history of certain consumers can prevent any financial harm from coming to companies such as mobile service providers. But there are a fair few downsides to this type of business as well. For example, whenever someone receives a \u201cblack mark\u201d regarding credit rating, the customer will not be notified in any way. Companies and financial institutions do not have an obligation to notify individuals regarding these decisions, although the implications can have major repercussions. Something as mundane as cashing a cheque in a foreign currency \u2013 even though it is in the customer\u2019s name \u2013 can lead to a fraud alert being put against that person. While the chances of this happening are slim, such an erroneous mark can destroy a person\u2019s credit rating forever. Opening a new bank account with a different bank will be impossible as well, due to this internal \u201cmarking\u201d system financial institutions use. While this is an issue that can always be rectified when appealing to the bank itself, this mark is not something that will be erased that easily. In fact, when using various companies to check out one\u2019s credit score, chances are they will display it as \u201cexcellent\u201d, making the consumer none the wiser. It should come as no surprise to find out most financial institutions are keeping a close eye on blockchain technology. One of the possible implementations of the blockchain could be to provide more transparency towards the bank\u2019s customers, something that is drastically needed sooner rather than later. Bitcoin is a viable alternative to traditional finance as we know it. A transparent ledger that displays any internal remarks banks may have about their customers would go a long way. Additionally, the blockchain powering Bitcoin\u2019s network can be used to transfer value all over the world in a matter of seconds.

Customers are advised to withdraw all of their remaining funds before that date, and a new platform has been announced. GateHub is the name of this new platform, which has been created to develop a trustworthy business around the consumer and gateway use case. Also read: Spending US Dollars From The Cloud With AirTM Is No Direct Competition for Bitcoin Truth be told, the announcement of shutting down Ripple Trade came as quite a surprise to a lot of people active in the digital currency industry. Considering how their engineers have been working on the project for over two years, and the keen interest from financial institutions all over the world, no one really expected anything like this to happen. But in fairness, the news is not all doom and gloom either. In an email communication sent out this morning, Ripple apologizes for the confusion caused by their earlier announcement. Ripple as an ecosystem is going nowhere anytime soon, and the growth and expansion of XRP as a currency will remain an integral part of the process. Furthermore, there is an optional migration path for users switching over from Ripple Trade to GateHub, which will act as the new trading platform. All it will take is just a few clicks, and all of one\u2019s personal Ripple transactions can be migrated in a streamlined fashion. Further details will be announced in a few weeks. GateHub will act as a platform to develop a trustworthy business around the consumer and gateway use case. To put this into layman\u2019s terms: more products will be built on top of the Ripple ecosystem, and GateHub will be the location where all of the action takes place in the future. It is important for all users to transfer all of their Ripple Trade funds to either GateHub or another wallet provider prior January 13, 2016. It will be interesting to see how many people decide to migrate to GateHub, and how many users will either leave the Ripple ecosystem completely or use alternative wallet solutions. According to the email communication, GateHub will be ready over the next week although no official date has been announced yet. More information on migration one\u2019s Ripple wallet to GateHub will follow shortly, and the Ripple support staff is available to answer any and all questions people may have.

This area has acted as resistance about four different times in the past two weeks. So why is the market having such a hard time breaking out here? A quick look at the chart from the start of November reveals some important details. The $3.70 area acted as support about four times towards the end of October and into the start of November. Price plunged under $3.70 on the 5th of November under very heavy volume, and this price level then turned into resistance. Litecoin traded well below the $3.70 pivot area for most of November, but this pivot is now acting as a major barrier once again. There is also a clearly visible ascending triangle formation on the 1h/2h charts, which suggests that pressure is building up in the market. A similar pattern occurred on Bitcoin a few days ago that resulted in a very explosive breakout. Will Litecoin explode upwards in a similar fashion? I guess we\u2019ll find out.

This area has now propped-up the market about six times since the beginning of the month. The longer price stays above/around 0.001, the higher the odds of a violent breakout. So, is the market giving any hints? I believe so! The 4-hour chart is showing a very clear MACD(Moving Average Convergence Divergence) divergence. This means that selling momentum has been weakening since the 8th of December. The formation of divergence is an early warning sign that market sentiment may be about to shift. If Monero rallies over the next few days, the 0.00115 area is very likely to come into play. This pivot zone acted as support about three times during most of November. Price then broke underneath 0.00115 on the 26th, and this level then turned into resistance. The market has reversed several times off the 0.00115 area during December, so I would assume that this level is very likely to act as resistance again.

Bitwage is a company that allows users to receive their [monthly] wages in the form of Bitcoin, without the sender having to do anything special. Improving this new payroll service is a key element to its success, in the long run, which is why a new Extended Public Key Import feature has been added. Also read: European Interest in Contactless Payments Creates Bitcoin Adoption Opportunities Conducting payroll services through traditional means can be quite a hassle as there is a lot of administration involved in the process. Especially when dealing with employees living abroad, things can get very complicated fast. Not to mention, there are quite hefty fees involved when sending international bank wires. Bitwage looks to alleviate some of that stress, as they allow recipients to receive their wage in Bitcoin. This method works for either full or partial amounts, as all they need to do is give the new bank account information to their employer. For people active in the Bitcoin community, using Bitwage makes a lot of sense, although there is always room for improvements. One of those improvements comes in the form of additional privacy enhancements. One of the previous updates made to the platform introduced Address Lists, which lets users upload a maximum of 100 addresses to fulfill transfers to. However, there was a huge demand from users for extended public key support. Enabling such a feature allows infinite Bitcoin address to be used on the Bitwage platform, as well as transmit more convenient address information. The way it works is rather simple: users upload their BIP 32 wallet\u2019s extended public key, of which 100 addresses will be derived. Once those addresses have all been used, Bitwage will automatically derive the next 100 addresses from the list. What makes this feature, even more, interesting is how this process is compatible with both Ledger and Trezor extended public keys. Both of these Bitcoin hardware solutions have seen a huge increase in popularity in recent months, and platforms are starting to integrate these solutions one by one.

In my previous CLAMS article from three days ago, I speculated that a break above this pivot would most likely trigger a bull market, and with today\u2019s decisive break, that hypothesis is looking even more probable. Price has now retraced and 0.0025 could now turn into support. If that takes place, then another rally is very likely to follow. The big question is: how much higher can the market go from here? Looking at the 4-chart from September and October, it seems that the next big pivot area is located squarely at 0.0045. This level held up price on five different occasion during those two months. This level then turned into resistance during the second half of October. CLAMS has not traded anywhere near 0.0045 since that time, so it seems obvious that this pivot zone is probably going to act as resistance now. The big surprise right now would be a plunge down to 0.0025. If the market trades lower \u2013 0.002 for example \u2013 then 0.0025 is probably going to turn back into resistance and such an event will signal a trend change.

Bridges, who pleaded guilty to money laundering and obstruction of justice charges, was also sentenced in a separate court, to three years of supervised release, once his initial prison term ends. For those who don\u2019t know, Silk Road is a now shuttered website, where people from all around traded illegal items such as drugs and weapons, by using bitcoin to pay for the transactions. During the investigation, Mr Bridges has been a part of the electronic crimes task force of the Secret Service. He used this position to illegally access the website and siphon a part of the funds into an account he held at Mt Gox, yet another shuttered Bitcoin exchange. The funds were then placed into his personal investments account, after he sold the bitcoin for around $820,000. Once the agency discovered his involvement in the bitcoin theft, his career ended. During his lengthy trial, prosecutors continuously asked to have the maximum sentence for the felonies that he was accused for delivered to him. Bridge\u2019s lawyer, Steve Hale Levin argued that: Rather than report the theft, he made the impulsive decision to steal bitcoins from a Silk Road account. Mr. Bridges knew from the moment that he stole the bitcoin that his career was over.\u201d Mr Bridges is now required to report to prison on January 29, when his term officially begins.

The market had a hard time trading above 0.000032 in the first half of November, and I think it will be an even bigger challenge for price to break above 0.000032 again. The buy side of the order book seems a little more beefy now with about 25 BTC in orders.

As price has continued to trade back forth in December, the 0.002 level has proven itself to be major area of interest.

A newly discovered type of malware targets iOS and BlackBerry backups, or to be more precise; it will target computers hosting a backup of mobile devices. In most cases, these backups do not contain the latest security updates, making them vulnerable to exploiting. Also read: M-Pesa Brings Mobile Financial Services To Ghana By going after the devices hosting a mobile OS\u2019s backup, this new type of malware can prove to be quite a nasty one. Even though security researchers had an idea of this type of attack being made possible, it is the first time malware operates on this same principle. In fact, there are over 700 different types of this malware in circulation right now. As you would come to expect, Windows is the most often targeted operating system to find mobile device backups. Only one certain \u201cfamily\u201d of malware is targeting Mac OS X users, although malware of this type is among the most active in circulation right now. While anti-virus tools, such as VirusTotal, will detect most of these malware attacks, not all of them are properly identified yet. It is interesting to note his this BackStab malware attack targets iOS and BlackBerry backups specifically. Considering Android is the most popular mobile operating system, it is apparently the most difficult one to breach regarding older backups. Most backups contain sensitive information such as the user\u2019s call history, pictures, and text messages. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of this new malware attack is there wouldn\u2019t even be a need for root or admin access to do its dirty work. This is especially worrying for iOS users, as their backups are very rarely encrypted. However, any user with a device running iOS 9.1 should be relatively safe from harm as those backups do not contain any sensitive information. What makes it easier for this new malware to identify iOS and BlackBerry backups on a computer is how they are always saved in the same standard directly. Android users, on the other hand, have no official desktop application to create device backups, nor would they be saved in a standard directory of some sorts. The number of Bitcoin users owning a BlackBerry device is fairly low, so there is no real threat in that department. However, there are a fair few iOS Bitcoin users, and it is important they upgrade their operating system to version 9.1 sooner rather than later. When they do so, they will also have to make to encrypt their backup. Once a malware-infected backup is placed back onto the device, all kinds of bad things could happen. For mobile Bitcoin wallet users, the malware could potentially log pin codes and other security measures, and attempt to bypass them in the background. Keeping a mobile device secure is of the utmost importance for Bitcoin users, as there is no solution to this malware yet.

Obtaining a bank account, or access to financial services through other means, is all but impossible. M-Pesa will operate under the \u201cVodafone Cash\u201d banner in Ghana. By reducing the need \u2013 and risk \u2013 for citizens to carry around cash at all times, the mobile payment solution puts users\u2019 minds at ease. As is the case in most African countries, There are more Ghanaians who have access to a mobile phone compared to the number of people owning a bank account. As part of this expansion, Ghanaians will be able to send and receive money through their mobile devices in the country, but international money transfers might be coming soon. M-Pesa international transfers are possible between Tanzania and Kenya, creating the first \u201ccross-border\u2019 use case for residents. M-Pesa statistics indicate a strong uptrend in the number of transactions made on the platform. Compared to the numbers of last year, there were 26% more M-Pesa transactions in the six months prior to September 2015. A total of 2 billion individual network transactions has been recorded during this period. That question is rather difficult to answer. Despite being an obvious candidate to bring financial services to the African continent, there seems to be very little interest in Bitcoin itself right now. Mobile solutions, like an M-Pesa, are far more favorable, because it\u2019s easier to use for real-life purchases and expenses. Bitcoin still has a long way to go in Africa, although there is a sliver of hope to be noted as well. As more and more citizens become accustomed to the concept of mobile payment systems, Bitcoin could eventually be embraced in its mobile wallet format. After all, Bitcoin transactions will work cross-border no matter what, as long as there is some form of Internet connection.

The 0.0000086 area has now acted as support about four different times, and also once as resistance, when price was trading under it on the 30th of November. The 4-hour chart is also showing a very clear Head&Shoulders technical formation. This pattern is signaling that the market may be getting ready for another break north. If price starts to rally over the next few days, there is another pivot level that may cause some problems. The 0.0000095 pivot zone \u2013 which I outlined in my prior BitShares technical analysis \u2013 is still very much in play. Today\u2019s big rally stalled as soon as price penetrated above 0.0000095. If price manages to break above 0.0000095 \u2013 let\u2019s say to 0.00001 \u2013 then this pivot zone will most likely turn into support once again, and a bull market will be very probable at that point.

According to recent reports, it seems like Goldman Sachs has gone ahead and developed its own cryptocurrency, meant for a settlement system that wants to make trading stocks, bonds alongside with other assets much faster. Based on the recently published patent filing, it seems like the New York-based giant initiated their patent application last year, for a digital currency named SETLCoin. The cryptocurrency is meant to make it easier for investors to trade securities, hence eliminating the gap between the moment when the trade is executed, and the actual delivery of the purchased securities. In their applications, Goldman Sachs says that the new digital currency implemented into their system is bound to guarantee \u2018nearly instantaneous execution and settlements\u2019 for their trades. So far, while trades can be executed instantly, it often takes days before the actual cash and securities are delivered to the investor, due to the settlement process, which brings in a great risk factor for both parties. At this moment in time, a growing global consortium of banks is working alongside with blockchain start-ups, to implement the technology in global finance. However, the appearance of other digital currencies meant for this purpose show that banks aren\u2019t necessarily interested in bitcoin, but rather in the blockchain.

The $3.28 level \u2013 where the market found support today \u2013 is actually a major pivot zone that goes back to the start of November.

Most people can\u2019t even point out this tiny nation on a map of Europe, but Luxembourg wants to be the European location of choice for global financial services. Who needs a financial capital when there is Bitcoin? Also read: Converting People To Bitcoin \u2013 Verification Procedure Struggles One thing Luxembourg has going for it is its status of the biggest centre for fund management within the European Union. This announcement couldn\u2019t have come at a more opportune time, even though taking the crown from London as being the FinTech hub of Europe will prove to be quite the challenge. That being said, more competition in the European financial services sector is never a bad thing. Through competition, there will be innovation and the end user will be the one benefiting the most. Several industry experts have high hopes of making Luxembourg the destination of choice in the EU for international investors. There are several factors to take into account as to why this plan might actually work. First of all, Luxembourg offers a physical environment for financial technology business to innovate. Secondly, the country is home to interesting regulatory measures as far as FinTech is concerned. Lastly, Luxembourg is well-known for its investment environment. Even though London firmly remains the biggest financial centre in Europe, and depending on whom you pose the question to, even the world. However, there is the looming threat of Great Britain leaving the European Union altogether, and that decision would heavily impact London\u2019s image as a financial hub. But that is not the only threat to London\u2019s \u201ccrown\u201d, as trouble is brewing within the UK as well. From the look of things, the country might be faced with higher taxes and even tighter regulation of the financial sector. It goes without saying that neither of these events would be favorable to international investors. Unlike its British counterpart, Luxembourg is often praised of its transparency in the financial sector. In fact, the country\u2019s financial industry achieved a global role without being covered by [too much] banking secrecy. In fact, any level of secrecy is hurting Luxembourg\u2019s wealth management industry more than any other country in the EU. As entertaining as this entire discussion is to a lot of people, there shouldn\u2019t be a \u201cfinancial capital of the world\u201d in the first place. There is enough money in the world to make life comfortable for everyone and Bitcoin is trying to point that out. In fact, Bitcoin is the only currency that can operate on a global level without having a \u201ccapital\u201d to begin with. The FinTech sector is a source for many innovations and we can only be glad such an industry exists. However, it is time more people start to realise that any form of centralization is no longer viable, nor important. Finance is a matter that is near and dear to everyone on this planet, and embracing Bitcoin will resonate that sentiment. What are your thoughts on this story?

The level also acted as support at the end of October, so I would consider this level a major pivot area.

It was only a matter of time until the first shakeout of companies would happen, as not every solution is viable in the long run. For German mobile payments outfit Yapital, things have come to an abrupt halt. Also read: Restricted WeChat Pay Expansion Shows Off Bitcoin\u2019s Strengths There are a few factors that determine the success or failure of new payment solutions. Otto Group launched their Yapital project in 2011 and was one of the frontrunners to explore the mobile payment industry. However, being among the first to venture into a new market is not always a guarantee for success. Yapital offered some interesting features, such as using QR codes to let people make instore and online payments, similar to how Bitcoin works. Additionally, Yapital users could pay bills with their mobile phones, which sounded like a great concept at the time of launch. Unfortunately, neither of these features proved to be much of a success, despite the headstart. Otto Group identified the culprit of Yapital\u2019s failure in the form of a very competitive market \u2013 especially over the past 24 months- and disappointing consumer take up. Mobile payment solutions will stand or fall depending on how many consumers actively use the application, and Yapital\u2019s market share has always been fairly low. But there was a positive side to Yapital too, as German retailers seemed keen on embracing the mobile payment solution. Come January 31, 2015, Yapital will be officially shut down as a mobile payment application, but it will stay active as an e-money institution for the b2b market. Interchange regulations are making it difficult for any mobile payment solution to gain ground in Germany and beyond. This causes margins to fall for companies, and in the case of Yapital, it even lead to a reduction in workforce. Despite best efforts by the team, things just didn\u2019t work out they way they could have. As these \u201chyped\u201d mobile payment solutions are faced with the harsh reality ofn ot being as popular as everyone assumed, the weed will be culled from the chaff in the long run. Despite all of these changes and competitive strategies, Bitcoin trucks on, unencumbered by what companies are trying to achieve in the mobile payment space. Regardless of how one wants to look at things, Bitcoin is the only global currency in existence today that does not depend on approval from banks or other financial institutions. Some people see this as a blessing, whereas others see it as a curse. But one thing\u2019s for sure: mobile payments with Bitcoin are far cheaper and convenient than anything else that will come along in the near future.

Also read: German Mobile Payment Solution Yapital Shuts Down The complaint by the SEC has been filed in federal court in Connecticut, and not only targets the two companies, but their founder Joshua Garza as well. Bitcoin community members from all over the world had been waiting in anticipation for this announcement, as many people lost digital currency when these two Ponzi schemes came around. According to the SEG, Homero Joshua Garza perpetrated Ponzi scheme fraud through both GAW Miners and ZenMiner, as he offered shares of a digital Bitcoin mining operation. However, there was never enough computing power present to mine the promised amounts of Bitcoin, and all of the \u201cpayouts\u201d were coming from other people\u2019s deposits. Most of the investors in GAW Miners and ZenMiner paid for a share of a mining operation that never even existed in the first place. While it was clear from the start that something was up with both companies, a lot of Bitcoin community members got swept up in the hype regarding both companies and learned their lesson the hard way. Joshua Garza has been running GAW Miners and ZenMiner from August 2014 to December 2014, and a total of US$20 m worth of Bitcoin mining shares were sold during the process. Over 10,000 investors purchased the \u201cHashlets\u201d, which were supposed to be \u201calways profitable and never obsolete.\u201d However, as neither company had any major computing power to speak of, investors were misled to believe they were sharing in Bitcoin mining revenue.

The reason behind this drastic decision is clear as day: the Pakistani government wants the manufacturer to install backdoors in their BlackBerry Enterprise Service emails and BBM chats.

Also read: Swatch Announces Pay-by-wrist To Take on Apple and Samsung The relationship between BlackBerry and the Pakistani government has been uneasy ever since the company\u2019s services were shut down in July of this year. Mobile phone operators in Pakistan were informed how BlackBerry would be deemed \u201cillegal\u201d if operation continue within Pakistani borders. Whether or not this decision will be a big loss to BlackBerry remains to be seen. According to a report by The Verge, BlackBerry serves roughly 5,000 enterprise users in Pakistan. The company could have opted to continue their services in the country, but the decision to leave Pakistan altogether may have been for the best. Above all else, BlackBerry values the guarantee of user privacy. However, in order to remain active in Pakistan, the company would have to forfeit that commitment as the local government demanded backdoor access to BlackBerry\u2019s chat and enterprise email services. Roughly 5,000 BES users won\u2019t add up to any major revenue discrepancies. Furthermore, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time BlackBerry complied with government demands regarding the monitoring of users\u2019 communication. Last but not least, BlackBerry announced they are more than happy to assist Pakistani law enforcement in any criminal investigations. Some people may see this decision as a win for privacy rights, but the general feeling is how this decision was more of a financial decision. There is always a certain trade-off between convenience and user privacy. However, Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain has shown the world how both goals can be achieved without making that trade-off along the way. Bitcoin users are pseudonymous on the blockchain while being able to use a convenient financial services network to send and receive payments around the world in mere seconds. Blockchain technology is not just suited for financial transactions, as it can be adapted to offer a new level of communication as well. Doing so would allow users to keep a certain level of privacy while using an open sourced decentralized network to communicate.

Especially credit cards pose a high security threat, as an assailant only needs to know the card number, expiry date, and CVV code to go on a shopping spree. BBVA Bancomer is stepping up their card security, however, as they have introduced dynamic CVV and CVC codes. Also read: London Black Cab Drivers May Soon Accept Indirect Bitcoin Payments Increasing security in the traditional financial world as we know it today is anything but easy. Credit cards pose a major risk, as this type of transaction is often subject to fraud and chargebacks. Also, a credit card\u2019s information is rather stagnant, as card numbers and CVV codes never change, unless the card has been replaced or expired. BBVA Bancomer in Mexico is changing the static three-digit security codes on the back of debit and credit cards. Thanks to its mobile wallet application, cardholders are now able to use dynamic CVC/CVV codes, which are generated every twenty minutes. In doing so, BBVA Bancomer becomes the first bank in the world to publicly experiment with this technology. The Dynamic Code Verification solution is designed to protect against \u201cCard Not Present\u201d fraud. This term indicates how an assailant would be able to make an online purchase with someone\u2019s credit card details, as long as they know the card number, CVV code and expiry date. Ensuring a dynamic CVV code has to be used will require the customer to have the card present at all times. Something had to change sooner or later in the online payment industry, as mobile banking, e-commerce, and m-commerce is growing exponentially. However, the level of security and trust remained stagnant, which is not an acceptable situation. Using a groundbreaking feature such as dynamic CVV/CVC technology, will be quite beneficial to consumers all over the world. According to a statement made by BBVA Bancomer\u2019s Najera Alva, more than 100,000 people are actively using the dynamic CVV/CVC technology through the bank\u2019s mobile application. This just goes to show how many consumers are concerned about card security. But BBVA is not only bank looking to increase plastic card security in the near future. OT Motion Code is available for physical purchases and is currently being tested by BNP Paribas. Rather than keeping a static three-digit code on the back of the card, there will be a small screen display generating periodic dynamic codes. Despite the efforts made by all of these banks to step up their security game, Bitcoin remains the most secure form of currency and transferring value around the world. With its nearly-instant transactions, low fees, and convenient way to store and manage funds, Bitcoin is slowly gaining ground in all corners of the world. Even though Bitcoin is still a far cry away from becoming a mainstream currency, more and more people are starting to see the value of using it as a currency, rather than just an investment vehicle. Scarcity plays a key role in the process, and the fairly low price per Bitcoin is a tempting entry point for novice users.

TrueCrypt has come under attack by various researchers and studies recently, although it turns out that this encryption tool is much safer than most would assume. Do keep in mind there is no such thing as a 100% secure solution, though. Also read: Commonwealth Bank of Australia to host Blockchain Workshop Just a few weeks ago, Google\u2019s Project Zero security team announced how they had found two undisclosed TrueCrypt vulnerabilities in this whole-disk encryption tool. The news came as quite a shock, considering how this encryption tool is used by millions of people all over the world. But it turns out things are not as grim as assumed at first. A new report was presented by Fraunhofer Institute for Security Information Technology. While the report itself is 77 pages long \u2013 and very detailed to regarding these alleged vulnerabilities \u2013 it turns out TrueCrypt is safe under certain conditions. To be more precise, users are advised to use TrueCrypt as a tool for encrypting data at rest, rather than encrypting data stored in computer memory or on a mounted drive. Furthermore, the two vulnerabilities discovered by Project Zero ought to be fixed, although there is no indication that they are viable exploits. Accessing encrypted data stored on an unmounted drive is still questionable, even when using either of these two exploits. That being said, there are still a few questions regarding whether or not TrueCrypt users are aware of how this tool was intended to be used in the first place. While it is positive news to hear the two earlier discovered vulnerabilities pose far less of a risk than originally assumed, there are various programming errors to be found in the TrueCrypt code. One of the most worrying errors comes in the form of using a Windows programming interface to generate random numbers used by cryptographic keys. On paper this may sound normal to some people, yet it creates weaknesses in the generation of random numbers by TrueCrypt. Fixing this flaw would require a code update, but that may never take place as the project is no longer actively being developed. Things are looking bleak when the original developers feel TrueCrypt can no longer be trusted. Encryption is critical for any computer user in the world, and even more so for Bitcoin users who want to go above and beyond to protect their funds. Encrypting a Bitcoin wallet can be done in a variety of ways, yet there are a fair few users who rely on TrueCrypt for this process as well. As it turns out, this is not the safest of solutions. Looking for alternatives can be quite a challenge as most of the projects following the \u201cpath\u201d of TrueCrypt are still in development. However, the silver lining is how the software has been made open-source, allowing any aspiring and experienced developers to take a stab at improving the product.

These patterns usually resolved themselves with a very violent break in either direction. The big question: which way is this gonna break? Let\u2019s take a look at the 30-minute chart for further clues. The 0.00295 area has played a very prominent role in the past few days; three times as resistance; four times as support. Price recently closed underneath 0.00295, so this level may turn into resistance now. There is a also a very clear trend-line, which started on the 13th of November. The market has bounced from this trend-line many times since the 13th. However, this trend-line was broken today! So, it seems the lower time frames are hinting at a bearish market sentiment.

Once price broke through this level on the 10th, this area then turned into support, when price retraced back down to 0.0000095, on the 12th of November. In my previous BitShares technical analysis article, I speculated that the 0.00001 area had turned into a pivot zone, and that it needed to be watched very closely. This pivot zone is still very much in play. The market has been grinding away above 0.00001 since the 17th of November, so this level is now acting as support again. If there is not enough buying interest to push price higher from 0.00001, a break to the downside is also possible. A bear market is very likely to start, if price plunges below 0.00001, and also 0.0000095. Both of these pivots levels should be watched for potential breaks!

Price is now approaching the previous high at 3900 Satoshis, which was put in on the 25th of October. Although GRC is in a bull market, the buy side of the orderbook has thinned considerably since my last Gridcoin technical analysis article. In my last piece, the orderbook had about 47 BTC in buy orders stacked at various levels below 0.00002959. Not so much orders now! GRC is now trading at 0.00003412, and the orderbook is now displaying about 16.5 BTC in buy orders. About a third of what it was at the end of October. However, I believe there is a good explanation for this. Since there haven\u2019t been any large dumps of GRC on Poloniex/Bittrex, those buyers most likely got tired of waiting for sellers to hit their bids, and instead decided to hit the seller\u2019s offers. This behavior is probably responsible for the gradual increase in price over the past twenty days. The 0.000032 level is a fairly established former resistance area. Price slipped above this level on the 18th, so 0.000032 is very likely to now act as support. Fundamentals: There is another key event taking place today, which has the potential to alter market dynamics. The block reward for Gridcoin is reduced to 50 coins per block, down from 75. This reduction has the effect of further reducing the total daily minted coins to 48,000. This is the final block reward reduction in GRC\u2019s schedule. At current market prices (0.000034), it will take approximately 1.6 BTC worth of daily buy orders to absorb the 48,000 daily minted supply of GRC going forward.

Regardless of which side you are on, the question remains a valid one. Also read: Fidelity Charitable Starts Accepting Bitcoin Donations While it is positive to see a future in which the banks rely on blockchain technology, there are still some misconceptions about this idea. Unlike what most Bitcoin enthusiasts might think, banks and other financial institutions are not looking at ways to work with the Bitcoin blockchain. Instead, they are developing their own solutions, the so-called \u201cbankchain\u201d. In a way, it would only make sense for financial institutions to create in-house developed blockchain solutions. After all, these organizations have been fighting tooth and nail to differentiate themselves from Bitcoin as much as possible, but at the same time, these bankchains are not solving the problem that exists in the financial world today. Relying on third-party verification is no longer a viable option in the financial world. Separate bankchains will not be able to communicate with each other and will still require third-party verification to complete transactions. The best case scenario would be to have this process completed through autonomous smart contracts, although that might be a bridge too far for the time being. Also, there is the problem of securing a bankchain. Proof-of-work seems to be the most secure way of protecting a blockchain network from harm, and this solution works quite well for Bitcoin. Whether or not bankchains will be secured by the same method, or rely on something else entirely, remains to be seen. Without any proper form of consensus, a bankchain will not be able to validate transactions in the same way that a blockchain would. As soon as there needs to be a third-party arbiter involved in the process, the entire concept can no longer be classified as a blockchain. Instead, the entire idea will look like a glorified version of traditional databases, which would only make matters worse. No one is pointing the finger of blame at anyone in particular just yet, but the approach of using permissioned blockchains and bankchains raises a lot of questions. Some people might even argue the banks are out to discredit blockchain technology simply because they have no way of reproducing its measure of success. It will be interesting to see what the future will bring in regarding the unification of traditional finance with blockchain technology. One thing\u2019s for sure: the technology will prevail in the end., but the battle will be long and hard and without the right approach the entire concept is on a rocky foundation for the time being.

According to coincenter, we do know that earlier this month before the Paris attack, digital currencies ranked lowest on a table measuring national risk assessment on money laundering. Scapegoating Encryption might be an easy move for the government, however, it will not help with the fight against terrorism as bad actors will find other means of communication. Believe it or not, encryption can help to protect governments as well; public key cryptography can help secure communications between government officials about top secret missions. Last month, CNN reports that the CIA director\u2019s email was allegedly hacked, luckily no classified information was leaked. This goes to show that if government officials get in the habit of encrypting their communication, an email hack would be rendered useless as no sensitive data can be found. As technology advances and more frameworks and plugins are launched, hackers will find new bugs to exploit and will continue stealing valuable customer data. If a database is encrypted, even if the hacker gains access to it, the data proves useless. Currently, the most common use of encryption is by companies which run a web server containing user account information. It is common to encrypt user\u2019s passwords in the unlikely case that the database is hacked. However, if the ban on encryption ensues and companies are disallowed to encrypt customer data, a single database leak can compromise many users\u2019 accounts. It is common for the average joe to reuse passwords on different online accounts. As a result, storing users\u2019 passwords unencrypted can lead to an increase in identity theft and credit card fraud cases. In the event that the government decides to allow hashing algorithms to store customer data, but only proposes a ban on public key cryptography (the type of encryption used to encrypt communication channels), criminals would begin exploiting the backdoors provided in current forms of corporate \u201cencryption\u201d. Some hoped for a compromise which would allow encryption, but with an exclusive backdoor access for the government. In other words, users would register their encryption keys with the government and then be allowed to use those keys. The encryption keys would be stored in government key-recovery centers, which would allow backdoor access to the passwords. The issue with that proposal is that the key-recovery systems would be centralized entities, which is a flaw in of its own. A disgruntled government employee with access to the key-recovery center could potentially compromise a massive amount of user\u2019s accounts. Furthermore, criminals would try to exploit those key recovery centers and, if successful, would be able to decrypt millions of account from all types of corporations. How do you think government should or should not regulate encryption?

Most people assume everyone in the world has access to the Internet, but there are still billions of people waiting to be connected. Mobile Internet connectivity is not always a viable option either, but that situation might be about to change, thanks to Microsoft\u2019s new initiative. Also read: Can Bitcoin Save Dwindling Black Friday Sales? As you would come to expect, Microsoft is not planning to roll out Internet infrastructure themselves, nor should they be looking to do so. That being said, Microsoft is creating a new fund to bring Internet access to the 4 billion people who are still disconnected. This new fund will serve as a financial aid to aspiring entrepreneurs tackling this issue head-on. Qualifying for this fund is subject to certain requirements, as only commercial organizations can apply, assuming they have at last a working prototype of their project. Additionally, there is a minimum requirement of having two full-time employees on the payroll, and paying customers are an added bonus for qualifying. Bringing internet connectivity to the disconnected will not be an easy task, as the lack of existing infrastructure makes it incredibly difficult to do so. That being said, this Microsoft fund is also aimed at startups looking to introduce new payment mechanisms and innovative business models helping to get the disconnected online. Every successful applicant will receive US$75,000 in funding. Also, Microsoft will provide a sort of incubator program, as well as free services and software. It is not the first time Microsoft ventures into the world of innovative technologies, as they have recently announced their plans to embrace blockchain technology. As Microsoft is targeting startups to bring internet connectivity and services to disconnected people, blockchain technology will play an important role in the process. Areas where there is no Internet infrastructure usually have no financial infrastructure either, and blockchain technology can give people access to financial services as long as Internet connectivity is available. Just a week ago, Microsoft announced a new cloud platform offering Ethereum Blockchain as a Service. Microsoft Azure users will be able to deploy blockchain technology in a few clicks, without requiring any upfront investments. Once companies and developers see the value of the Ethereum blockchain, they can take things one step further, and develop financial tools for the soon-to-be-connected population. What are your thoughts on this Microsoft fund? How would you bring Internet connectivity to the 4 billion people still disconnected? Let us know in the comments below!

Details about the potential attack have first appeared on Reddit, where users stated that they were not able to log into their accounts, while some also stated that they\u2019ve noticed unauthorized bitcoin withdrawals from their wallets. Purse.io was quick to respond and they shut down their business operations, while also announcing that there had been a small issue in their system, as password reset requests were continuously being received and sent out. The company also stated that they\u2019ve moved user funds to private bitcoin addresses, to make sure that no funds would be stolen in case an actual attack was taking place. Users are now worried that their financial information was leaked, whereas others are stating that their bitcoin has indeed disappeared. Purse.io denied these allegations, and declared that all funds are secured, that a fix had been implemented, and that the service has been resumed. Together with this, the company affirmed that people with two-factor authentication were not affected. As of this moment, 2FA is mandatory for all Purse.io users. Regardless of this, there are still mixed messages, as customers are continuing to complain that their bitcoin has been stolen during the attack. We\u2019re not yet sure what to believe, and are waiting for Purse.io to make another press statement, and assert whether any funds were affected during the security breach. In case funds were actually stolen during the attack, Purse.io will definitely suffer some drawbacks, as it\u2019s inadmissible for a prominent bitcoin company to be affected by such attacks.

China has its \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d, effectively cutting off the country from most foreign websites that can not be controlled by the government. Russia\u2019s Internet watchdog is trigger-happy on getting certain websites blocked, and now the Turkish government has decided to block all traffic to the Reddit platform. It\u2019s a good thing Bitcoin discussions can be hosted elsewhere. Otherwise this would create a major issue. Also read: Bitcoin Overtakes Yuan On Google Trends What makes this story of particular interest is how there has been no official communiqu\u00e9 regarding the reason for blocking Reddit access. According to the information we have received, the Turkish government has made DNS changes to block access to the Reddit platform anywhere in the country. It is not the first time the country takes an aggressive stance towards social networking sites. As of this Friday, the blockade has been in effect, as various Internet users voiced their concerns regarding Reddit not being accessible. Based on the information provided by a dedicated government website, the route to Reddit has been restricted due to a \u201ctechnical analysis and legal considerations\u201d. Bypassing this blockade is not all that difficult, as individual users can manually update their device\u2019s DNS settings. While this process is not as straightforward for less tech-savvy people, Google has put together a comprehensive guide on how to change DNS settings. For now, this process will make Reddit accessible again for Turkish Internet users, although that situation can change at any time. The only way to prevent these scenarios is by embracing decentralized social media networks. Facebook, Twitter, and consorts are all very popular social networking sites, but each and every one of them possesses a central point of failure. Decentralized solutions are the answer, and several of these projects are in development as we speak. One of those platforms is called Synereo, which touts itself as being the \u201cnext-gen social platform.\u201d By removing any single point of failure, the Synereo social network can not be taken down, hijacked, or blocked by government officials. Additionally, users can determine who can see their profile and content if needed, rather than making it public automatically. Datt is another decentralized social media network, developed by former Reddit employee Ryan X. Charles. But there is more to Datt than just being another social media network, as the platform offers Bitcoin-powered incentives as well. On top of that, Datt will embrace commerce, allowing users to buy and sell just about everything.

Usually, this doesn\u2019t happen, but considering the fact that we have no idea who the creator of bitcoin really is, we might soon be witness to a world first. Satoshi Nakamoto, which is the pseudonym of the creator of bitcoin, has his name on a paper published in 2008, talking about the concept of digital currencies, but also about what bitcoin is truly meant to be. While for all we know, the person might not even exist, this hasn\u2019t managed to stop UCLA Professor of Finance, Bhagwan Chowdhry to nominate Nakamoto to receive the Nobel Prize in economics. In a recent interview, the professor explains his choice: The invention of bitcoin \u2014 a digital currency \u2014 is nothing short of revolutionary\u2026it offers many advantages over both physical and paper currencies. It is secure, relying on almost unbreakable cryptographic code, can be divided into millions of smaller sub-units, and can be transferred securely and nearly instantaneously from one person to any other person in the world with access to internet bypassing governments, central banks and financial intermediaries such as Visa, Mastercard, Paypal or commercial banks eliminating time delays and transactions costs. Based on this, regardless of the individual perception that people have on bitcoin, we must all agree on the fact that it represents a wonderful economic tool, advocating for personal liberty, and an overall better financial system, which is why the system is this clever.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/microsoft-dives-in-on-the-blockchain/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Microsoft Dives In On The Blockchain", "content": "There have been a lot of headlines lately about the growing interest in blockchain technology from banks around the world. While Bitcoin remains something of an unproven resource \u2014 valuable but nowhere near the potential some people still envision \u2014 the public ledger used to track its transactions has proven to be of major interest to a number of industries. The idea of a blockchain system in which transactions are automatically and always recorded is a simple concept with the potential to greatly improve the speed, accuracy, security, and transparency with which business is conducted. Just this fall we saw nine of the world\u2019s biggest banks join forces to create a framework for using blockchain in financial markets. And in the time since, even more banks have joined in, resulting in a very real initiative to take Bitcoin\u2019s technology and turn it toward existing financial systems. The core concept underlying this movement is to improve transparency and facilitate big data analysis that would theoretically allow banks to better understand and ultimately balance economies. This is a very serious development with potential to drastically change the ways in which big banks do business, at least in a broad regulatory sense. But more recently, there\u2019s been another interesting piece of news that should hit a little closer to home. Specifically, Microsoft has announced a partnership with blockchain start-up ConsenSys to bring Bitcoin and its technology to financial institutions. This essentially means Microsoft is lending its name, industry clout, and cloud platform to a company that, with that backing, is capable of bringing blockchain technology and cryptocurrency security to major financial companies. It\u2019s a little early to say what the specific effects of this move will be, and in fact Microsoft is still playing its cards close to the chest in terms of which financial institutions have already signed on (though four \u201cmajor\u201d ones supposedly already have). But the move does appear to be the latest indication that while some countries are actively prohibiting banks from involvement with cryptocurrency, Bitcoin continues to thrive in the U.S. despite the lack of an official government stance on their usage or value. In other words, the U.S. does not yet recognize Bitcoin to the extent that it can be used in official government transactions, but it\u2019s doing nothing to stop or slow the increasing influence of Bitcoin and Bitcoin tech in the banking system. Ultimately Microsoft\u2019s involvement may amount to its own corner of the overall movement toward banks implementing blockchain-like technologies. However, the deal also carries the potential to help the involved financial institutions to actually start dabbling in cryptocurrency specifically, which would be a very major development indeed.

However, things have changed quite a lot as time passed. In fact, Joseph Bonavolonta, who is the Assistant Special Agent that is in charge with the FBI\u2019s CYBER Counterintelligence program, has made an interesting statement, over at the Cyber Security Summit of 2015, stating that ransomware has become so good, that it\u2019s just advisable for companies and individuals to pay the ransom and be done with it. Based on this, we have clear proof that ransomware is becoming increasingly popular with extortionists and cyber criminals all around the world. They operate by locking down systems and rendering them useless, while also compromising stored data until ransoms are paid. At this moment in time, most of the ransoms are requested in the form of irreversible transactions such as bitcoin. The FBI representative has stated that they are still hard at work to find a way to combat ransomware, but for now, that it is best for companies to simply pay the ransoms to get access to their systems, unless they have data backup stored somewhere. Cryptolocker was the most popular form of ransomware last year, but it has recently been replaced by Cryptowall, which is even stronger from of ransomware. Probably, the best way to not be affected by ransomware is prevention. Keep in mind that it\u2019s often acquired through web ads that start automatic downloads, thus initiating strong encryptions, which are often unbreakable. Don\u2019t access suspicious sites, and always use an antivirus. Currently, extortionists ask for a few hundred dollars to restore users access to their computers. Based on this, it\u2019s important to always have an up-to-date backup of your data, just to be safe. We\u2019re excited to see whether the Blockchain Alliance will play a role in combatting the rising popularity of ransomware.

Currently it seems that we are in the midst of a fairly big dump as trading volumes have increased hugely over the past few days whilst prices have seen an opposite movement as they slide further and further into oblivion. This week has been one of the worst weeks for ethereum throughout this month as it has experienced what many would call a flash crash as nearly one fifth of the value of the coin has been wiped in a matter of days. Starting yesterday the prices began their downward trend as prices began a slow but steady decline reaching prices of 0.0047 BTC in a matter of just 6 hours. However disaster soon struck as the prices of ethereum crashed to 0.0041 BTC in a matter of 2 hours. Whilst this price crash was dramatic it has been referred to as the beginning of the dump as volumes being traded are in an excess of $1.5 million. This has come as a shock to many considering trading volumes were lingering in the range of $350k just a matter of days earlier. Speculation Well currently there is not a lot of optimism available in the markets. As currently market prices are in turmoil it may not be the ideal time to jump in and buy cheap coins. This is advised for two reasons as at the moment the momentum driving the prices down being too strong. I would put the floor at around 0.004 BTC. Whilst we are nearing the end of the tunnel it may be a long while before progress upwards begins and I would advise anyone aspiring to enter the market to do so on Monday when prices should have increased by 5-10%.

However the current stable but rapid growth propagated by the markets has allowed Ripple Coin to once again climb the ranks coming in only second to Bitcoin in terms of market cap. Below is the 7 day trading graph depicting the movement of the Ripple price. As we can see below it seems that the figure of 0.00003 BTC is the main price point providing support and holding up the coins price. We can see how at two points the prices dipped to this level but in both instances prices made a quick climb back up as the markets corrected according to the volume being traded. On a lighter note it can also be seen that the huge increase in volume over the past day on an excess of 300,00$ has resulted in a nother price climb which may be set to continue in accordance to the previous prices earlier in the week. Speculation Well personally I would label the Ripple Coin/Token with a moderate buy label as under current conditions the price is likely to increase by at least a further 5% before the momentum slowls down. I would set a target of at least 0.000037 BTC for the token/coin to achieve before momentum may run out.

While the coin itself has a minuscule value it has seen a decent price rise over the past 24 hours which has seen a increased volume and market cap in accordance to the new liquidity and capital which has been flowing in. Whilst the coin has moved in the right direction many including me are wondering, how long will this last as the many have described the coin as a pump and dump scheme considering the unhalted and uninterrupted growth that had hit the coin throughout the majority of its lifetime. Whilst the last few weeks have seen the prices fall at a fairly rapid rate many are considering the true motives of developers and whales alike. Below is the 7 day price graph outlining the movement of the coin. As seen below the majority of the week was spent riding along the 0.00000025 BTC level as prices remained stable in accordance to the stable volume.

Falling in value considerably over 24 hours earlier this month the price has remained at a tame value of 0.000084 BTC for the latter part of the past 30 days. It seems as if there is no support currently present to stop the steady fall as prices drop further and further. Currently it would be wise to avoid buying into the markets as current turbulence may last a while as prices continue to reflect market activity. Currently it seems that a large sell off is occurring with many dissatisfied investors and opportunists ready to cut losses and ultimately pull out of the market.

With a discreet operation which led to free clams being associated to each bitcoin address (which had a balance), the distribution went far and wide allowing many to enjoy the benefits of Clam at no cost. With each address receiving an average of 5 Clams the popularity and exposure gained increased rapidly. Price Analysis The value of Clams has increased steadily over a long period of time. With the initial growth spurt started by Just-Dice, which was the most popular Dice Site before its abrupt closure, being reopened as a exclusive Clam casino, the cryptocurrency hasn\u2019t looked back moving forwards and upwards from thereon. Following the initial jump in value the currency remained at a stable price threshold until the last few days when it made its latest move. The markets reacted to increased sentiment and trading volume by following up with a increase in price. The past fortnight has indeed been very successful for the coin as it has increased considerably in value jumping from the initial price of 0.009 to over 0.011 with no signs of a stop in growth. As seen in the graph below when Clam prices increase it is more likely that they will remain at higher levels and midway through this rally it would be wise to stack up some coins, but remember never invest more than you can afford as losses can exceed deposits. Speculation The current growth spurt shows little signs of manipulation as according to the increase in trading volume, the value of the coin has also followed naturally. The increase also shows a natural growth pattern as the market seems to correct upward movement but with the level of liquidity and capital flowing there seems to be much more growth in store. I would anticipate a 0.014 Bitcoin to be the next milestone that should secure these higher levels. Any lower and we may be heading back down as following the previous rally, prices should reach these levels by the end of the week reflecting the volumes of over 10k USD which are being traded everyday.

A service called Tree\u2019s has created its own selection of medicinal cannabis selection boxes. It sells medicinal cannabis and has its own way of ensuring it doesn\u2019t get misused. In California to legally purchase cannabis you require a valid reason for its use and a medical license. How to buy cannabis from Tree Tree has simplified the purchasing as much as they can as you can buy it on your iPhone or laptop. First you choose the box you would like to purchase as they have a varied selection including: The Jedi Kush box, The Bud box and the Exotic box. Then after you have entered our address you send them photos of your driving license and medical license.Then upon instant approval you can pay via Bitcoin, cash, cash or debit card and online bank transfers. However currently it only delivers to the San Francisco bay area. Aside from California, medicinal cannabis is also legal in Colorado and 21 other US states. It is also currently looking to pursue drone deliveries and is hoping as soon as laws on drone deliveries get passed they can start them. The founders Marshall Hayner and Mikko Ohtamaa are passionate about the cryptocurrency and are pioneering the medical cannabis sector. They claim to sell only the \u201chighest quality\u201d medical cannabis and have lots of different accessories with their products such as lighters, rig rags, rolling papers and glass and paper tips. All their products come with certificates of authenticity and ensure the utmost quality even when delivering. Even their delivery drivers accept Bitcoin tips. \u201cThe industry as a whole has been stagnated by lack of innovation and greed .Bitcoin is a light in a dark tunnel for the cannabis industry.\u201d The drone deliveries will also be pioneering as many providers are yet to invest in the technology. The drones are faster and more efficient than modern travel methods however there is still uncertainty on whether there will be any laws or methods of controlling what goes where when the robots will patrol our skies. The Bitcoin industry is also growing as this shows the services it links onto and this in turn also benefits their businesses.However the founder said the drone video \u201cwas really just a viral thing\u201d he commented that \u201cWe are currently working on drone logistics and as soon as the FAA passes the appropriate legislation we will have fleets in every state.\u201dThey also plan to expand to other legalized states and hope to help the people in chronic diseases such as cancer and AIDS as this is the sole intention of their service.", "date": "2015-07-31T19:22:00+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 31}

This is why thousands of people from all around the world have turned to using online miners. HashingSpace Corporation is a popular firm which has been offering Bitcoin miner hosting for a while now. Well, the latest reports indicate that the firm is now investing a ton of money into reshaping its infrastructure to reduce their energy consumption and make Bitcoin mining more efficient. With this in mind, they\u2019ve recently made an announcement stating that they have employed the services of Ross & Baruzzini, which is a leading engineering and architectural firm that will now be in charge with designing HashingSpace\u2019s new state of the art data centre. As Ross & Baruzzini has been in the industry for over 60 years, the company has tackled some of the most challenging architectural and engineering projects and always came up with great results. What makes this news great is the fact that HashingSpace is the first Bitcoin miner company to have secured the services of this firm. With this in mind, once the work on the state of the art data centre is completed, the miners will operate with maximum efficiency. The architects also have experience in planning the systems which allow buildings to perform at their highest potential, while also offering mechanical, plumbing, fire protection, electrical infrastructure, communications, air flow and more. By making sure that all of these systems are fully integrated with each other, the computers doing the mining will be more optimized and the average cost /kilowatt that HashingSpace charges will also be reduced. In the end, HashingSpace will have a 109k square foot facility, with over 1,500 server racks and a total of 22,500 servers, with room left for more. If everything goes ahead as planned, they have high chances of becoming the biggest online bitcoin mining company, while also taking down some of the other competitors.

Launched as a revolutionary leap in crypto technology as it launched alongside a exclusive platform. Whilst the development of the coin has yet to slow down it seems that market action has slowed down considerably over the past few days leading to stagnation and ultimately, a slow but defined devaluation. Below is the graph displaying the price movement which has rocked the Ripple market. As seen below the current market climate may not be allowing for much price movement in the upward direction simply due to the constant price decreases plaguing the markets. In some ways like bitcoin, once ripple had entered this phase of stagnation it was always going to be difficult for a trend reversal rather than a complete rally as investor confidence is at a all time low following no positive market action. Speculation Currently it seems that the price of ripple may carry on going downwards as it follows the trend set over the past few days. With many graphs showing a grim impression of whats to come it may a while till the currenty activity is reversed as a floor is not in sight with volumes stronger at much mower levels. I would expect the price decrease to carry on till levels of 0.00002881 BTC at maximum before the trend is broken. This has occurred earlier in the week where this level became a signal for a small price increase which saw prices bump up to 0.00003319 BTC for a few days.

MtGox, headed by Karpeles, was the first and largest Bitcoin exchange prior to its shut down. The exchange, which was first intended to be Magic: the Gathering Online Exchange (MtGOX), accounted for 80% of all Bitcoin transactions prior to folding in February of 2014. The exchange shut down after allegedly losing 850,000 Bitcoins, worth $387 million at the time. One month after shutting down, Karpeles announced that he had found 200,000 of the missing coins in a cold wallet, bringing the total missing down to 650,000. MtGox played a huge role in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and the shutdown had huge consequences. The price of Bitcoin dropped 25%, around $200 per, February 2014, which was caused primarily due to MtGox closing its doors. Not much information was released regarding how the coins were lost. MtGox has been hacked in the past, and due to its relatively poor security, many people originally believed the site was hacked. However, popular speculation today suggests that the coins were actually gambled away \u2013 that Karpeles wagered exchange balances on the price of BTC, and lost. In response to the arrest, a former employee and ex-CEO of the exchange in 2011 shared a lot of shocking information regarding the business in an Ask Me Anything Reddit thread. In response to a question asking what took place during the former employee\u2019s time at MtGox, this answer was given: This is not Karpeles\u2019 first legal troubles.

His bail terms were set out by U.S magistrate Judge James Francis and limit his travelling to parts of Florida and New York where he can look for a job. However he has been ordered not to communicate with anyone he has worked on the laundering operation with or served. His website coin.mx was a shady exchange service which was stopped on the 21st July 2015 when Anthony Murgio and his partner, Yuri Lebedev, were arrested. He was charged with one count of money laundering and one count of willful failure to file a suspicious activity report. During the investigation in which they were arrested, The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) worked hand in hand with the US Secret Service. At the time the FBI stated that they used a phony \u201cfront business\u201d and utilized a federal credit union they purchased solely for their scheme \u201cIn doing so, they knowingly exchanged cash for people whom they believed may be engaging in criminal activity.

In doing so, Murgio, and his co-conspirators knowingly enabled the criminals responsible for those attacks to receive the proceeds of their crimes, yet, in violation of federal anti-money laundering laws, Murgio never filed any suspicious activity reports regarding any of the transactions.\u201d They allegedly handled at least $1.8 million on behalf of their customers. Murgio was also linked to the hacking of JPMorgan Chase & Co according to the FBI. The cyberattack hit 83 million bank customers in around 3 months however he hasn\u2019t been charged for it.

According to Bloomberg: As a result, China is now selling gold as opposed to buying it on price dips. It is the perfect recipe for weak prices.

That sounds pretty good for a blue chip stock right? On Friday, Google has set a new all time high at 699.62$, after it reported that second-quarter net income was $3.93bn in the three months to end-June, up from $3.35bn for the quarter a year earlier. The rise took the company\u2019s market size to well above $400bn, below Apple, which is currently valued at $745bn. The results ended six consecutive quarters in which Google\u2019s earnings fell short of analysts\u2019 targets. The chart above shows the last really good quarter Google reported, which pushed the stocks value almost 14 percent. Lets take a look at a weekly chart to see exactly where the stock stands. I am not going to try and figure out trades, this is parabolic and right now from a trading stand point, should be left aside. However, as an investment, it might not be the case. Last week looks like a true breakout, with heavy volume and a very wide range. After breaking 700$, a psychological level, Google has held high right below the round number, without giving back any gains after a sixteen percent surge. No one is planning to get rid of this stock, people are still piling in. If wee look in the past, a similar breakout occurred at the last very profitable earnings report, with high volume and wide range (the first picture in this article), and Google went higher and higher for the next few months, eventually entering into a prolonged consolidation period (which ended last week). I personally hold Google stock, and I am planning to be holding it for a while. I wouldn\u2019t advise buying now, but I think this is definitely a great investment!

The arrests took place primarily in Madrid, as well as other areas throughout the country. These individuals were arrested due to their affiliation with Unetenet, a Spanish cryptocurrency pyramid scheme. Unetenet, launched in 2013, is a pyramid scheme that operated through the sale of Unete, a digital currency similar to Bitcoin. Investors exchanged Euros for the scheme\u2019s cryptocurrency, which investors were promised would maintain a value of $1 per coin. Throughout the duration of the scheme, police estimate that investors suffered as much as 50 million Euros in losses. The pyramid attracted around 50,000 investors world wide, with 6,000 originating from Spain. In late June, it became official that a significant portion of investors had begun taking legal action against the heads of the operation. However, Spanish police verified that investigations on Unetenet began about 18 months ago, when a former employee of the group confronted law enforcement. Investors were intially drawn to the scheme due to compelling promotions; Unetenet gained popularity immediately after launch due to exciting events, and promising sales pitches. The scheme promised investors up to $1,300 in weekly returns. In addition, Unetenet offered the ability to shop online with Unete, through their official website. In addition to arrests, police seized 22 million USD and 5 million Euros from associated bank accounts. Two luxury cars and 18 computers were also confiscated. Funds from the pyramid flowed through an operation located in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, a Carribean island used as a tax haven. However, the illicit funds were frozen in April 2014, when Riemutu, a Latvian bank, closed an account used by Unetenet. The account was closed in response to a money laundering investigation associated with the account, thus ending the scheme. In addition to the cryptocurrency pyramid scheme, founder Jos\u00e9 Manuel Ram\u00edrez Marco also solicited funds from investors through donations to the Unetenet Foundation. The Foundation expressed it was gathering donations for victims of sexual abuse, however the group was never registered, and did not conduct charity of any sort.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/current-state-of-the-blocksize-debate-bip-100-vs-bip-101/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Current state of the blocksize debate \u2013 BIP-100 vs BIP-101", "content": "Blockchain technology is a brand new technology whose first application is Bitcoin. Like all software, it is not perfect. Bitcoin has proven to be resilient in terms of security and as a store of value, but one major roadblock that we are running into is scalability. As you may know, Bitcoin currently has a 1MB block size limit. A block is found on average every 10 minutes meaning that as a network Bitcoin is only able to process 1MB of transaction data every 10 minutes. Doing the math yields a limit of 7 transactions per second. That may sound like a lot, but compared to the giant credit card VISA which processed on average 2,000 transactions per second puts the limit in perspective. There are several proposals to increase the blocksize, some want a temporary 1MB blocksize increase in order to solve the temporary scalability problem, another proposal aims for a gradual blocksize increase starting from 8MB and doubling every 2 years for 20 years, last but not least another similar proposal exists which also gradually raises the blocksize limit but which allows miners to vote on future blocksizes. Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik has proposed an increase to bitcoin\u2019s block size limit to 2MB [BIP 102]. The proposal is intended to buy more time to reach a consensus on a more durable solution before the maximum amount of transactions per second on the Bitcoin network is reached. We saw first hand what happens when the amount of transactions exceed the size of the block \u2013 it caused a massive delay in confirmations. While an easy solution is to increase fees, many bitcoin services still use a 100 satoshi fee which is vulnerable to a dust transaction spam attack. Thus, if we raise the blocksize by 100% from 1mb to 2mb, the amount of work an attacker needs to perform in order to create a backlog of spam transactions doubles. Garzik wrote: The major downside to BIP102 and other proposals to the blocksize debate is that a hard fork is needed in order to deploy any blocksize changes. A hard fork should be avoided at all costs as Bitcoin is still in the mass adoption stage and a hard fork will create confusion and chaos in the community, ultimately weakening bitcoin itself. However, in this case we might need a hard fork regardless and now would be a better time to do that than later. Raising the block-size limit has been a controversial issue for several years. Satoshi Nakamoto originally intended it to be a temporary measure in 2011 to prevent spam, but several developers and other prominent Bitcoiners now believe a limit on the block size may actually be much needed. They believe such a limit safeguards the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and provides a long-term incentive for miners to secure the network. It seems that the current competing blocksize increase proposals are Jeff Garzik\u2019s BIP 100 and Gavin Andresen\u2019s BIP-101. Both BIP 100 and BIP 101 are similar in the sense that both offer a gradual blocksize increase. The main difference is the frequency of the blocksize increase interval and the fact that Jeff Garzik\u2019s proposal allows for miners to vote for future blocksizes. Jeff Garzik proposes to remove the 1MB limit and let miners decide on future blocksizes. The fork would occur on January 2016 followed by blocksize upgrades every 3 months. Because the voting system might be easily rigged if large pools decide to play dirty the consensus must reach 90% instead of the usual 51% majority. Here is a short summary of the proposal: 1. Hard fork, to 2. Remove static 1MB block size limit. 3. *Simultaneously*, add a new floating block size limit, set to 1MB. 4. The historical 32MB limit remains. 5. Schedule the hard fork on testnet for September 1, 2015. 6. Schedule the hard fork on bitcoin main chain for January 11, 2016. 7. Changing the 1MB limit is accomplished in a manner similar to BIP 34, a one\u00adway lock\u00adin upgrade with a 12,000 block (3 month) threshold by 90% of the blocks. 8. Limit increase or decrease may not exceed 2x in any one step. 9. Miners vote by encoding \u2018BV\u2019+BlockSizeRequestValue into coinbase scriptSig, e.g. \u201c/BV8000000/\u201d to vote for 8M. Votes are evaluated by dropping bottom 20% and top 20%, and then the most common floor (minimum) is chosen. Gavin Andresen proposes to increase the blocksize limit to 8MB starting January of 2016 and gradually increase it over time in intervals of 2 years, doubling each time.. Just to be clear, once the 8Mb limit goes into effect the doubling of the size every 2 years will NOT cause a hard fork because the rules are going to be put into the network in the first hard fork.

As the market continues to adapt and evolve, new and revolutionary technologies are situated just around the corner, and in a couple of years, all of these will work towards a better financial system, and an Internet system, where things can actually be done well. With this in mind, financial opportunities, unbiased data, the freedom of speech and of choice, but also true privacy all represent areas that we have to focus on in order to make sure that everything goes ahead as planned. However, can the system really become secure, decentralized and autonomous in the case that developers do not have access to enough resources and funding in order to make their ideas a reality? The Corona project was created to help the development of smart contract-based applications, which will have the opportunity to defy all of the corporation monopolies, which are unfortunately leading the market at this moment in time. To put things better into perspective, Corona is a hub for Dapp developers that supports all of the decentralized platforms such as Bitcoin, Codius, Factom, Omni, CounterParty and more. With this in mind, it is more of a network where developers from all around the world can discuss different ideas, but also get access to a wide variety of resources and funding opportunities, which will, in turn, help them come up with new ideas, while also powering the future of decentralized apps, cryptocurrencies, the Internet and the current financial system. Now that the project has launched, those who would like to support it will also receive credits which can then be used to get access to a variety of Dapps that are being crafted within the network, while also helping in their development. With everything that has been outlined so far in mind, the Corona project aims to support different autonomous services and apps including online gaming, file sharing, web hosting, P2P finance, social messaging and more, thus building the next generation of Internet applications, with the help of the Blockchain technology and all of those who have taken an interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

With the country open to the opportunities of Bitcoin many in India believed that Bitcoin would soon take its first steps and bring the innovation and profit which it has to many other countries. However recently it seems as if the country is starting to crack down on Bitcoin transactions with a number of businesses reporting being shut down or questioned by authorities over their actions. Just today it was also announced that BTCXIndia, one of the biggest trading platforms originating and based in India has also been forced to close down amid concerns about the regulation of Bitcoin. The statement below was made as a press release on Reddit. It highlighted how the banks of India are too turning their business away from Bitcoin with the risk of being fined and embroiled in legal disputes causing a stir among the banks of india. the full statement can be read via reddit here This isnt the first time crypto has come into contact with the authorities in India as UnoCoin oner of indias most used bitcoin wallets also came under scrutiny as it was met with government force. In an recent incident the coin came into contact with police officers who quizzed staff on the coin. However it seems that the lack of regulation and the confusion and miscommunication currently occurring throughout the country may be to blame for the recent spate of attacks on Crypto and its infrastructure. To conclude with the number of countries banning or outright regulating the use of Bitcoin, it is forecasted that the value of Bitcoin itself will be hurt in the long term. With countries stemming the Bitcoin, organisations can no longer freely develop infrastructure for Bitcoin in a variety of countries such as China and Russia which have also banned the use of Bitcoin. Other Asian countries such as Bangladesh have also shown their views on Bitcoin by placing those who use the cryptocurrency in jail. With this negative press furthwer smearing Bitcoins name it wont be a easy future for Bitcoin enthusiasts hoping to use crypto on a daily basis.", "date": "2015-05-08T16:16:37+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 8}

Historically, Russia has been one of the biggest critics of Bitcoin. The country has a reputation of limiting the currency usage, primarily through the banning of many Bitcoin related sites. However, the country has appeared to begin changing its stance against cryptocurrencies. Russia has recently unbanned many of the Bitcoin related websites that were previously blacklisted, and the country is now taking a more lax stance against digital currencies. Putin\u2019s statement regarding his view of digital currencies is continuous with this change in behavior. Although he fears the value of Bitcoin as a currency, he understands potential of the technology, and agrees that Bitcoin should not be disregarded. \u201c[Bitcoins] are backed by nothing. This money [is backed by nothing], that\u2019s the point, this is the major problem. They are not really linked to anything and backed by nothing,\u201d Putin said. \u201cHowever as an accounting unit, these \u2018coins\u2019 or whatever are they called, they can be used, and their adoption becomes wider and wider. As some kind of unit in some account, probably, it\u2019s possible,\u201d Putin stated. Although no definite comments were made in regards to Bitcoin legislation in Russia, Putin made it clear that Russian citizens will not have to question the legality of the cryptocurrency. The fact that Putin made it clear he did not see Bitcoin as a viable currency in today\u2019s world may appear to be a red flag, but the bigger implications of this forum are overwhelmingly positive. The fact of the matter is that Putin made no mention in regards to the prohibition of Bitcoin. The bigger picture of this forum is that Bitcoin is not illegal in Russia, and it does not appear that this will change in the near future. For Russian Bitcoiners, this is great news.

Whilst Germany is one of the biggest economies on the plane, providing much of the international industrial power alongside China, is likely to become one of Bitcoins next pastures as the country thrusts itself to modernize its aging but vast economy. As seen above these new views shared by many other German economists have helped to popularize Bitcoin among much of the German economist population. With many other countries such as the US also campaigning for a move to a cashless society it would come as no surprise that one of the most influential and outspoken economists has also rallied support for a cashless society. Bitcoin has been poised to replace physical cash since its inception and it seems with the help of Bofinger, Germany too may finally embrace Bitcoin and the technological and social benefits it too can provide in comparison to fiat. To conclude, the voice of the famous German economist is thought to be pivotal in influencing the government to regulate digital currency and make the slow transition to a decentralized and advanced economy possibly using Bitcoin as the new medium for trade and economic development. The US has also expressed a end to the use of physical cash which is thought to have caused many economic problems through out the country, and while Bitcoin is prone to devaluation similarly to fiat currency, Bitcoin is backed by energy as coins have to be virtually mined whilst fiat currency can be printed on demand and can be prone to various other problems highlighted by the US such as fraud and the illegal printing of fake currency has also been highlighted as one of the main benefits of using a digital monetary system such as Bitcoin.", "date": "2015-05-16T16:47:53+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 5, "day": 16}

The company has attempted using loopholes in the original contract in a attempt to avoid the payments to no avail.

The latest \u201cbusiness model\u201dcomes in the form of cryptochange.org. This website claiming to be backed by the Crypto Private Investor Group, has popped up after much excitement from none other than Josh Garza. Whilst Josh Garza has been unusually open about the project, discussing it openly on the Hash Talk forum, the launch of the website has not gone down well with many linking it to the past ventures of Josh Garza. Its not just the reputation of Josh Garza which has led many to believe this site is a scam/fraud as the site itself contains many factors and features which are typical of a scam. Initially the address used as the postal address of the company has been highlighted to be a virtual address. Using the site http://www.virtualpostmail.com/ the company have obtained a address. This has been highlighted as the first sign of the scam as the venture has no official documentation or property for investors to go after when the venture eventually folds. Next the website design also looks extremely similar to the ones adopted by a variety of other sites. It has been brought to our attention that the images and assets used on the website have been used elsewhere. As pointed out on reddit : As pointed out by the user, the site is made up of entirely components used in other sites. As seen in sites like the late LunaMine these sites which borrow pictures are also more likely to have a fraudulent purpose as not even the website is unique and authentic to the company. On the other hand the past reputation of Josh Garza is proven to twist all his ventures out of proportion. The many shattered hearts and minds of those who were involved in the failed PayCoin have not yet recovered as the many empty promises remained unfulfilled and will continue to be so till the foreseeable future. With the PayCoin leaving a lasting impression it comes as no surprise many have turned their noses up at another chance to work with Garza. With the new company linked directly to the man himself, it looks to be a difficult task for many to swallow another pill which is likely to be costly yet again. To conclude this new organization which has appeared on the horizon is seemingly innocent but with the current state of things in the Bitcoin sphere , one can never be to careful when dealing with investors. In particular when dealing with Josh Garza, who has a reputation for running scams and business ventures which have been exposed as fraudulent, the launch of this new site has raised plenty of eyebrows. With many condemning his latest move, it seems Josh Garza is still free to roam Bitcoin markets at will and many have also highlighted how his latest move has effectively abandoned PayCoin users yet again.", "date": "2015-04-30T20:28:46+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 30}

Apart from bitcoin which has clearly set the standard, there are a couple of altcoins with quite a lot of popularity. One of these is Digitalcoin, and ever since it was created, the cryptocurrency has gone through different struggles, but has managed to overcome most and become a prominent figure on the market. However, the latest developments are bound to hurt it, unless something is done to help it rise back again. Digitalcoin was originally created by Baritus, and the fact that it had a powerful system behind it, quickly transformed the cryptocurrency into one of the most darling on the market. Thanks to this, it had also gathered a good number of followers and quite a lot of attention, until an unfortunate event ended up being its undoing. Not too long ago, the creator of the currency was apparently robbed by an ex-employee out of 560,000 DGCs, which at that time\u2019s current trade value, meant a lot in bitcoin, or fiat. What\u2019s surprising is the fact that most of the DGCs stolen were dumped. About a year ago, the Digitalcoin Foundation was formed and initially led by rawdawg. In the next couple of months, the cryptocurrency was featured in a good number of places, including at a couple of conventions, where it was open-heartedly welcomed. However, after a year or so, rawdawg disappeared and baritus, the creator of the currency had resigned. After this event, kenel took over as the official President of the Foundation, and announced that the cryptocurrency was now being taken over by the Foundation, and that they will be responsible for its development and future. Shortly after this, Digitalcoin V3 was released, worked on by highly respected developers ahmed and xawksow, and there was some excitement around DGC, but since then, no major evolution had taken place since kenel assumed his position as the President of the Foundation and around a week ago, he decided to resign his position, stating that the community would be better off without the leader. However, many believe that this was a cop out, and that the community is now in need of a leader more than it has ever been until now. It\u2019s unclear whether the Digitalcoin Foundation still exists or not, and it appears that the community is now desperately in need of a leader, but no one in the Foundation is currently willing to assume the position and take charge of it, hence someone else from the outside will need to go ahead and step up in order to provide some direction, in hopes that the coin can once again rise to prominence and have an important influence on the market as it used to until now. With everything that has been outlined so far in mind, anyone who feels like they would be a right fit for leading the Digitalcoin Foundation, would be encouraged to step in and convince others that he is good enough for the position. However, it is important to keep in mind that the position will require a lot of responsibility, as the Foundation needs a leader who will be able to bring everyone together, in hopes of promoting the currency and making sure that more people begin using it.", "date": "2015-04-20T08:56:05+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 20}

A surprising development shows that National Aten Coin, which is also the creator of the Aten Black Coin, was recently accepted into the ABA, which is practically the hub for the U.S. banking industry, as it manages a total of around $15 trillion. After being accepted as a Platinum Service Member, this means that NAC will be lucky enough to join a prestigious group of banks, which are currently being used by the ABA in order to safeguard around $11 trillion in assets, but also around $8 trillion in loans, which are incredibly high amounts. This achievement has encouraged the owner of the coin to go ahead and invest a large amount of money in order to promote it further, while also ensuring that the platform it runs on is well-updated and ready to be used by people from all around the world Marcus Andrade, CEO of NAC also believes that in a couple of years, the cryptocurrency will turn out to be the industry leader on the cryptocurrency market. Although this goal is a bit far off at this moment as Bitcoin is the absolute leader on the market, nothing is impossible However, the acceptance of NAC into the ABA also proves an interesting point. So far, people mostly thought that banks were against cryptocurrencies because of their volatility, but also because many of them were vulnerable and unreliable. In this case, NAC is playing an important role in eradicating the trust issues that cryptocurrencies had to deal with until now, while also proving that if used correctly and with regulatory practices, they can turn out to be quite safe, while also representing a reliable system. Reports also indicate that banks have been looking for a cryptocurrency that is good enough to handle all of their stringent standards and it seems like NAC is one of the first ones to actually be accepted. While the level of acceptance is still very small, if the coin proves itself to be trustworthy, then chances are that more banks will start considering the idea of being more open-minded towards the cryptocurrency market. It is also worth keeping in mind that this has only been made possible because the coin does follow a couple of strict rules, which doesn\u2019t allow it to be influenced too much by the market. However, it still keeps a decentralized status, and the fact that it works on an innovative platform will do nothing more than grant it more popularity.

Whilst many label altcoins as copy and pasted coins with only one purpose, to make money for the developers, a new coin has come out to challenge these stereotypes. 8Bit only released a few days ago has already set the hearts of investors alight with the markets reflecting the current success of the coin. The 8Bit Coin is a new coin with a new theme. With the age of 8Bit gaming firmly cemented in our minds but buried in history, the Coin aims to rekindle the fire which was once part of everyone\u2019s childhood. 8Bit Coin aims to relate to those who cherish gaming at its prime and aims to integrate crypto fully into this world. Market analysis : The coin is relatively new to markets but with it already accepted on a variety of exchanges such as Bittrex we have pulled data analyzing and displaying the coins performance. Currently the price per coin has increased to over 400% with in a time frame of 24 hours. Initially the coin hit markets at a price of 68k Satoshis just a few days ago but has ballooned in value to reach a value of over 450k Satoshis a piece. This massive hike in value has been compared to the price rises seen in various other coins and fears have risen about the coin being a simple Pump and Dump Coin. With a trade volume sitting in an excess of 100 Bitcoins it seems demand for the coin has surged significantly with in a short time frame. A strong and defining upward trend has been established as today (at the time of writing) has seen the coin jump from 80k Satoshi to over 450k Satoshi a piece. update \u2013 The coin has seen further price rises today with the price increasing a small but appreciative 6% on the Bittrex Exchange. However the high of 450k satoshi is nowhere to be seen currently with prices sitting around the 200k satoshi mark. With volume remaining over 100 Bitcoins current markets allow for the growth of the coin particularly in the financial aspect. To conclude, the new coin which has taken us by storm is also performing great on the markets. With both the sentiment and capital supporting the coin, it seems the coin is destined to outlive its counterparts in the altcoin scene which have a lifecycle of a few weeks on average. With the development team behind the coin supportive and the community also thriving at the end of the POW mining phase who knows what is in store for the future of the 8Bit Coin.

Finding a way to save some funds can be a difficult ordeal, but an interesting bitcoin alternative seems to have found a solution. DNotes, a stable cryptocurrency that is quickly gaining popularity has been acclaimed as one of the most reliable currencies available on the market. What makes it special refers to the fact that it can be easily used as a savings alternative that can bring in high returns. When compared to bitcoin, DNotes has not suffered value depreciation yet although it has been released some time ago, which further proves its reliability. The cryptocurrency has recently announced that they will soon begin a Cryptocurrency Investment Savings Plan for students, which aims to provide them with multiple opportunities later on, while also helping students avoid the crippling loans debts once they graduate. This idea came along after a stability study was carried on DNotes, which made the funders consider the fact that student debt issues have stricken way too many undergraduates and that something needs to be done. Based on what the representatives of the currency have commented, the global problem can actually represent an opportunity both for the cryptocurrency, but also for students who are willing to participate in the program. Once enrolled, they will be engaged and involved into a wide array of activities, thus making sure that they get high returns from their investment, but also a good number of job opportunities later on. In turn, students who participate will also likely become future leaders, currency holders and will be the ones to provide solutions for different economic crises, after being involved with a cryptocurrency and such a plan at a young age. As student loans represent a threat to the idea of a hyper-connected world, where just about everyone is educated and has access to the Internet, the entire idea of debts could be solved once some more attention is emphasized on the plan brought in by DNotes. To kick things off, schools, universities, but also educations clubs from all around the world will be given codes, which students will then be able to use in order to register into the network. Once they do, all of them will be awarded a total of 500 DNotes and an interesting process which will bring them a good number of opportunities will begin.

The website is special in the Bitcoin world because it joins only a few licensed platforms, thus making exchanges from Bitcoin to fiat and vice versa much easier, while also improving the gambling market. Recently, the firm has announced that bitcoin-to-fiat deposits are now possible on the website, thanks to the investment from CoinMatrix, a company based in Hong Kong. The thinking behind their investment stems from the fact that this company wants to end up with a large share of the market, which is currently worth $320 million, while also having an important influence on the exchange market. By using the platform provided by CoinMatrix, users can change their bitcoin into US dollars and various other fiat currencies. The process can take place automatically, and this allows for easy maintenance of account balances. Customers also have the chance to bet in whichever currency they choose. Betkurus has become a leader in the global bitcoin market, and has made its mark as the first Bitcoin operator to make this particular feature available to its users, as no other operator has managed to do something like this until now. This has also created an interesting trend on the gambling market, as it seems like more companies are beginning to consider the ideas put into play by Betkurus. Players can make their deposits using bitcoin, yet play in their local currency. Since cryptocurrency is not accepted by many players, it can often be difficult for those who like betting using their own currency. The new deposit feature that has been introduced made this a breeze, as users will simply not encounter any issues related to currency and exchanging once they start betting. More than 20,000 events take place on the Betkurus website each month. Apart from a wide variety of sports events, players can also bet on casino games such as Poker, Roulette and Blackjack. Currencies like Bitcoin are in the process of changing the gambling and gaming industries. Jon Matonis, ex-director of Bitcoin Foundation, declared that he believes the top gaming companies won\u2019t allow anything other than Bitcoin in the next five or so years, which makes sense, given the great value difference between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Following the recent investment from CoinMatrix in DigitalSport Entertainment, Betkurus has been able to provide a truly revolutionary feature to many keen gamblers. By improving the financial aspect of cryptocurrency gambling, chances are that the firm will evolve quite a lot in the next couple of months, as the investment that has been received will also be used in order to introduce many other features. While bitcoin gambling still isn\u2019t incredibly popular, moves like this will surely improve the popularity of bitcoin-based gambling sites.

A large majority of bitcoin vendors have a dollar value next to the bitcoin price, and even those who only accept bitcoin fluctuate their prices based off of the current exchange rates. But what if bitcoins, dogecoins, litecoins, and every other coin out there was more than just a set of numbers with an attached dollar value? Colored Coins may very well be the solution. The concept is straightforward. With Colored Coins, users can \u201ccolor\u201d their coins, giving them a label, an additional set of information. With these labels, coins can be attached to commodities, assets, stocks, and more. Beyond numbers and electricity, bitcoin and other altcoins can be backed by a real life value using Colored Coins. Coins that have been colored effectively become tokens. These tokens can be recognized by various parties as representations of stocks, bonds, houses, and just about anything else. By exchanging these tokens, both parties can bypass the regulations, taxes, and restrictions that would normally hinder the trade of the assets they represent. Colored Coins has launched with bitcoin recently, but has yet to receive major usage. Some altcoin developers have declined integrating the system into their currencies, but many others have considered the implementation. Most notably, Opalcoin has taken measures to apply Colored Coins to their cryptocurrency. Opalcoin\u2019s relatively short lifespan is one marked by constant evolution. The altcoin features several features not found anywhere else, and their plan to integrate Colored Coins does not come as a surprise. Opalcoin has actually been working towards Colored Coins integration for several months, and appear ready to go live with it. Today, Opalcoin developers announced that they expect colored coin support to go live in the next few hours. Opalcoin, launched in September of 2014, is a cryptocurrency known for its anonymity, or the \u201copacity\u201d as it is commonly referred to. Anonymity is one of the core values that coin was founded upon, and unique features such as encrypted messaging and opaque addresses give users the tools to maintain their anonymity. Another goal the developers had early on was to implement a market place free of taxation for the coin. A commodity exchange, where users trade goods and services, rather than money, was one of the first visions for the coin. There is hope that Colored Coins may be the solution to create this system. With Colored Coins, Opalcoin users will be given the tools necessary for anonymously trading gold, bonds, stocks, and anything else via colored Opalcoins. Colored Coins is a revolutionary system in the cryptocurrency world. One of the major criticisms to altcoins is that they lack any real value outside of what people are willing to pay for them. Colored coins dispels this criticism by giving users the ability to bind their coins to assets. Opalcoin might just be the start Colored Coins needs to gain widespread adoption.", "date": "2015-04-07T21:52:48+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 7}

For gambling options in particular, these benefits provide great utility. As a result, the bitcoin gambling industry is filled with unique and creative casinos, with new ideas forming constantly. Launched in July of 2014, MoneyPot is a prime example of the creativity found in the bitcoin gambling world. The game play is simple, and at face value, there isn\u2019t much strategy to it. The website initially greets you with a sleek, simple design. After clicking \u201cPlay Now!\u201d, the user is redirected to a graph. The value of the graph increases exponentially, and the current value of it represents the value of your bet. At any time, the game can end, and the value of the graph reduces to zero. After the crash, there is a short intermission to place your next bet, before the graph restarts at x1 and the game commences. The graph represents the value of your bet, and the goal is to withdraw your bet before the graph hits zero, and the game ends. Like any risky investment, the most profit will come if you hold onto your bet as it grows and cash out right before it loses all value. The game can crash at any given time, and there is no indication prior to it. There is also another element to the game, an element that makes it social. To the right of the graph is a box that indicates all active betters. The box updates to indicate exactly when each player withdraws their bet before the crash. The game also offers a bonus to the last handful of players who cash out before the crash. The house edge fluctuates between 0 and 1%, and part of this house edge is redistributed through this bonus. This bonus adds another mechanic to the game, and allows for skilled players to beat the edge. By setting your bets based off of the competition, you can receive frequent bonuses that overcome the house edge. Bonus prizes are commonly worth between 1-3% of your bet, but can the bonus can reach up to 100%. This means the most skilled players can achieve a positive edge of 2-3% or more. The base bet on MoneyPot is one bit, and all bets are measured in bits. The top ten most profitable players have all earned more than at least seven million bits, which equals net profits of more than seven bitcoins each. These players have found a viable strategy, and have exploited the bonus to obtain a positive edge. Deposits are acknowledged after just one confirmation, allowing users to get into the action in just several minutes in most cases, and never after more than an hour. For those who wish to give the game a try before depositing, the site also features a faucet that pays users a couple of bits every hour. MoneyPot is a fast paced and intense option for all bitcoin gamblers. The site is both profitable and fun, and if you haven\u2019t done so already, register an account and give it a try.", "date": "2015-04-04T02:05:18+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 4}

Paycoin reaches $20 in an unprecedented value increase", "content": "Ever since we started out as a news site, we have mostly focused on Bitcoin and general aspects of the cryptocurrency market, without covering much about altcoins, regardless of the fact that some are getting quite popular. However, \u2018quite popular\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be the phrase used right here, as Paycoin has recently become astonishingly popular, in an unprecedented move that is bound to shock the cryptocurrency environment from all the points of view. The latest reports posted by exchanges from all around the world, showed the price for one paycoin at $15, which is amazing when considering the fact that the same amount was valued at $0.55 in the last couple of days. This is beyond BREAKING NEWS, as no one has anticipated that such an event will occur. This strong volatility of the coin does not really have anything to back it up, but one thing is certain- those who already had some paycoins stored just become RICH! Economic analysts from all around the world who are outraged have also said that the value is thought to go above $20 in a matter of hours from now, which represents a price increase greater than any that other cryptocurrencies have faced until now and will probably do in the future. When asked to comment about this, Josh Garza, the embattled CEO of a mining company, but also the founder of Paycoin has stated: \u2018The prices are increasing and the number of cars that I own is doing just the same\u2019!. This thought out, yet baffling comment came just a few minutes after he posted a picture with 3 new Ferraris over on his Instagram, which he reportedly just purchased with the help of paycoin. The unexpected paycoin price increase will not only make the coin a lot more popular, but it will also encourage others to invest capital. For those who already had paycoins stored, things may be a little different, as most will most probably decide to sell, while those who are a little more daring will decide to hold on to the currency until its value increases even more. While trading paycoins at this moment is dangerous, the number of transactions on the Blockchain has skyrocketed, and if it continues like this, chances are that the total number will bypass the total no. of daily Bitcoin transactions. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, the unprecedented and unexpected value increase for paycoin yet again proves the volatile state of cryptocurrencies, and the possibility that all of those who have already invested have of becoming rich overnight. On that bombshell, feel free to start investing in paycoin, but also to sell what you have already acquired, but don\u2019t forget that it is APRIL FOOLS!", "date": "2015-04-01T19:23:57+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 4, "day": 1}

Looking back, March was a very exciting month for bitcoin. The month started with bitcoin prices rising quickly after a relatively calm February. Bitcoin entered march at just under $255 USD per bitcoin. Prices continued to rise until a year high $298 per on March 11. Many were sure the price would break $300, but exchanges rates took a full turn, as bitcoin began to dip. It has continued to drop since the high of $298, and the cryptocurrency ended the month at an exchange rate of around $247. The are several major events that most likely contributed to the steep price changes. 50,000 bitcoins were auctioned by the US Marshal Service from the Silk Road bust on March 5th. The bitcoins were divided up into 20 blocks, and auctioned separately. The bitcoins were all purchased by three anonymous bidders. This auction seems to have contributed to the rise in bitcoin price. Midway through March, admins at Evolution, one of the largest DarkNet Markets, ran off with 120,000 bitcoins. this theft is one of the major factors contributing to the price drop in the following weeks. Several large corporations began accepting bitcoin in March. T-Mobile began accepting bitcoin the second week of the month. The company is allowing pay-as-you-go phone users in Poland to top-up with bitcoins. What\u2019s more, they are offering a 20% bonus. Rakuten, a Japan based retail giant, also began accepting bitcoin. Neteller, an e-money/e-wallet stored-value service, implemented bitcoin deposits at a 0% fee. Neteller has integrated bitcoin for users worldwide. However, the server is not available to those in the US. Lastly, Reddit announced that bitcoin can now be used in Reddit markets, via Twitter, on March 9th. Bitcoin was adopted by several very popular services, for both good and bad. ChangeTip has added tipping support on twitch.tv. ChangeTip is a popular service that allows users to tip set amounts of bitcoin to users through a variety of platforms, including Twitter, Reddit, and Youtube. Twitch.tv is one of the most visited sites in the US, and is dedicated to allowing users to stream video game content, as well as view others streams. As of March 20th, viewers can send tips to streams through ChangeTip. Before this integration, users were limited to PayPal donations as forms of tipping streamers. Early in the month, uTorrent, a hugely popular BitTorrent client with over 100 million users, automatically installed a cryptocurrency miner to automatically run on user clients. This abuse led to an outrage from the public, and many users uninstalled the software. In response, BitTorrent removed the miner three days ago, on March 28th. On March 7th, Spain made a huge step in bitcoin integration. Bitcoin ATM provider BTCPoint partnered with Spanish national bank Banco de Sabadell. The result of the deal is 10,000 new Bitcoin ATMs throughout Spain. Spain citizens will be able to withdraw and deposit from any of the ATMs. They will not require an account with the bank. Undeniably one of the most controversial issues this month is regarding formal federal agents Carl Mark Force IV and Shaun Bridges. Both were charged with money laundering and wire fraud late last March. Force IV, of the DEA, and Bridge, of Secret Services, were both involved in Silk Road investigations. Both obtained hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins through extortion, bribery, and theft during the investigation. March of 2015 was a controversial month in the bitcoin world. March, which marked the 5th anniversary of the first fiat value assigned to bitcoin was very interesting, to say the least.

Today, bitcoin can be seen in many different fields both online and offline. One of the first applications of bitcoin was its use in the online gambling industry. The online bitcoin gambling industry started early in bitcoin\u2019s development, and has steadily grown ever since. Poker is one of the most popular forms of online gambling, and in the bitcoin gambling industry, Betcoin Poker is undeniably the largest provider of online bitcoin poker. Betcoin Poker is one of three branches in the Betcoin franchise, along with Betcoin Casino and Betcoin Sports. Betcoin Poker, launched in late December of 2013, is the second branch of Betcoin, released after Betcoin Sports. Betcoin Poker founded themselves into an industry dominated by Seals With Clubs. Seals had always been by far the largest bitcoin poker option, and Betcoin sought to take some of the market share as their own. They competed with Seals to provide the highest quality poker experience on the market. The competition, however, has since ended, as Seals With Clubs has recently shut down. After the Seals shutdown, Betcoin established themselves as the top bitcoin poker site in the world. One of the major drawbacks of bitcoin poker are the limitations. Most bitcoin poker sites house a small player base, which also means that there is not much variety in tournaments and ring games, simply because there just isn\u2019t enough poker players to fill the games. Betcoin Poker, however, is not nearly as limited as the other sites. In fact, the activity mirrors what might be seen on mainstream online poker sites, such as Carbon Poker and Pokerstars. At any given time, several dozen poker tables across six different games are in session. There are always dozens of sit n go tournies running, with many more in the process of beginning. In the tournament section, every size tournament from 10 players to 1,000 is in session. Many of the Betcoin Poker players choose the site because of the flexibility in tournaments. New tournaments begin every 5 minutes, and many times more than one tournament begins at the same interval. The tournaments cover every player from free rollers to high rollers. At Betcoin Poker tournament, your ideal poker tournament is always in rotation, and you have the power to choose exactly what stakes you want to play at, on what game, with how many people, at any given time. Earlier this month, Betcoin hosted their Million Dollar Sunday tournament. The tournament was by far the largest in bitcoin poker history, with almost two thousand players registered and a guaranteed prize of one million dollars. This tournament was not limited to wealthy gamblers, as a large number of satellites were held in the weeks prior to the tournament at varying stakes, giving all players an opportunity to participate. The tournament was a huge success, and the site has since announced that their next Million Dollar Sunday will take place in April. Betcoin Poker empowers its players with the freedom to play exactly what they want. Betcoin Poker is a very highly recommended online poker option for both casual and professional online poker players in the bitcoin world. If you are looking for a quality poker experience, give Betcoin a try.", "date": "2015-03-29T18:11:42+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 29}

Cryptocurrency exchanges are typically associated with fraud and hacks, and not without reason. Earlier this year, bitstamp, a popular exchange, was hacked, losing access to 19,000 bitcoins. The year before, the infamous MtGox shutdown, keeping thousands of users without access to hundreds of thousands of bitcoins. LazyCoins, a UK based exchange, has learned from the mistakes of their competition, and have been working towards the most secure, user friendly, and hassle free exchange option available. The site recently launched early this March, following a six month beta. As of now, users can exchange GDP and Euros for bitcoin and litecoin. The exchange received their MSB credentials on January 2, one of only a couple of UK exchanges to do so. What this means for users is same day deposits without fear of banks cancelling payments or freezing accounts. LazyCoins hopes to make purchasing bitcoin easy enough for every day life, and acquiring their MSB is a huge step in the right direction. Another core value at LazyCoins is security. The company understands that once someone is able to compromise funds, it\u2019s too late. That is why they have taken measures to prevent all possible theft attempts, as well as to ensure that any future security breach will not be awarded with a single coin. 100% of all currencies on the exchange are held in cold storage, and protected by multi-factor authentification. The site does not use any hot wallets whatsoever, and the hardware that holds their coins is located deep in the Swiss Alps, safe from the chaos of the real world. Security, integrity, and community are the three pillars that LazyCoins is founded upon. The bitcoin world is one inhabited by scammers, hackers, and thieves. The exchange fully understands that, and they are working towards becoming a name free of these entities, a place that people can trust. During the half year beta phase, the company accepted and encouraged all scrutiny against the platform, constantly working towards improving the system to dispel criticisms. They have also designed themselves to be transparent, and the users know what is going on at all times. The last key ideal of LazyCoins is community. Everything the company works towards is for the users. LazyCoins strives to be the top option in the world some day, and that success is entirely dependent on the people who use it. That is why the site has held just a .24% fee on all transactions. During the six month beta, the site even rewarded its users with feeless trading. LazyCoins has also elected to add future currencies to the exchange based off of credibility and community support, as opposed to voting systems and altcoin donations that other exchanges commonly use. The company also plans on releasing LazyPay in the coming months. LazyPay plans to empower merchants and businesses with bitcoin support. Used in conjunction with LazyCoins, the company will be able to offer the most secure, efficient, and cheap option for accepting bitcoins in the world. The company feels that bitcoin will be used in daily life at some point in the future, and they hope to spark that movement through their services.", "date": "2015-03-26T21:06:10+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 26}

Crypto-Games is a digital currency gambling websites with exactly these two games, and they accept a variety of different coins besides Bitcoin. Let\u2019s see what they have in store for us. A lot of people are attracted to digital currency-related gambling websites because it offers a form of anonymity. Instead of having to enter your financial details \u2013 including your real name and home address \u2013 sites such as Crypto-Games let anyone play without disclosing any personal information. Plus, you won\u2019t even have to create an account to start playing. Every user who visits the Crypto-Games website is assigned a unique ID, which is being tracked through browser cookies. However, these cookies only remain valid for 14 days, after which the user will have to learn his/her ID by heart. Otherwise, all funds associated with that user ID will be lost and cannot be retrieved. In order to cater to as many online gamblers as possible, the Crypto-Games website has to be made compatible with all major browsers. Assuming you have a somewhat recent version \u2013 Chrome 31 or better, Internet Explorer 9 or better, Firefox 33 or better, Opera 26 or better, Safari 17 or better and an Android Browser 4.4 or better \u2013 you will have no issues accessing the website and its games. Deposits of supported currencies require one network confirmation before you can start playing. In the case of most coins, this should take a few seconds, but Bitcoin and Llitecoin deposits can take slightly longer. Do keep in mind that depositing funds from an exchange wallet will take even longer, up to several hours if you are unlucky. Keeping the games fair on a gambling website is standard practice, yet not all sites have a fair house edge. Crypto_Games has two separate house edges, one for their Dice game [1%], and one for their Slots game [1.241%]. All outcomes on the Crypto-Games website can be verified by the user themselves as they are all provably fair. Crypto-Games wouldn\u2019t be a respectable online gambling website if they didn\u2019t offer a referral program. Users can earn some additional funds by referring their friends to the platform, and earn 25% of the house edge on every bet made. It is important to note that you will earn this funds regardless of whether the person you referred wins or loses. As I mentioned before, Crypto-Games supports multiple digital currencies.

As an effort to increase its popularity, the world\u2019s first Bitcoin alternative meant for gaming has started sponsoring a couple of popular games. With this in mind, HYPER is now pleased to announce that they have started funding the adventure game, Troll Song which is the world\u2019s first indie game to be backed by a cryptocurrency. This means that the game development will now be carried out thanks to the funds the team behind the game has received from HYPER. The sponsorship came in as a big surprise mainly due to the fact that the company behind Troll Song was having trouble finding sponsors, as not many were willing to invest and put themselves at a financial risk. However, the investment made by the cryptocurrency with the help of their own tokens represents a win-win situation, as the coin has the opportunity of being used by more people and the game developers have received the push they needed to be able to finish up the game and market it all around the world. Not only will the game see some significant updates in the next few months, but it will also begin offering players cryptocurrency rewards, just like it is already being done by games such as CS:GO, Corsa Racing, Assetto, StarMade and more. As a cryptocurrency and Bitcoin alternative, HYPER is basically a low energy coin designed for one main purpose- to serve the gaming industry. With this in mind, it means that players will be able to buy games or make in-game purchases with the help of the cryptocurrency. Other games such as the ones outlined above will also begin offering their players cryptocurrency rewards that can later be used to buy new upgrades, or even be exchanged to fiat and therefore used as a normal currency, just about anywhere around the world. Reports also indicate that the Bitcoin alternative was added to Coinpayments.net, which means that online merchants will not be easily able to accept the coin as a form of payment. As time passes, artists are also picking up the coin, as it is gradually becoming a cryptocurrency popular for being used as a way to pay for entertainment, or to cash in rewards. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, chances are that HYPER will start playing a bigger role in the gaming industry as time passes, as users have been fully satisfied with the coin and the way it functions. The rewards which are being given out are also worth it, as the value of the coin is steadily increasing and is suspected to reach a new top-value in the near future.

With this in mind, SFARDS, formerly known as Gridseed has recently made a big announcement, as the firm has introduced the world\u2019s first 28 nm Bitcoin and Litecoin Dual-Algorithm ASIC Tapeout. The system, also known by its shorter name of SF3301 will most probably be the next generation of dual-algorithm mining chips, which means that it will now be able to mine SHA-256 and Scrypt simultaneously, a performance that has never been achieved by another system. The Chinese firm should be praised for the fact that the new system which is underway at this moment will hold some great implications on the cryptocurrency market, as it will make mining Bitcoin and Litecoin less of a stress for all. The power consumption improvement which is worth pointing out is thought to take efficiency to a whole new level. Now, when minding with SHA-256, chances are that the consumption should be below the 0.3J/GH range. While mining with Scrypt does consume more power, the amount is predicted to reach 2.0 J/MH, which is still great considering the complexity behind the mining process. The Chinese company also reports that the new system will be extremely versatile, as it will allow users to easily farm more than one currency on the same device. When you think about it, this will allow price fluctuations to be easily harnessed and used to one\u2019s advantage, as miners will no longer be forced to turn off their miners when a surprising situation arises. Another idea that the company is promoting is that users will now be able to farm altcoins in order to cover the electricity bill, whereas Bitcoin can be farmed for profit, which is another great idea bound to give the firm a larger number of clients from all around the world. SFARDS has also received financial backing from a couple of reputable sources including some tier-one international partners, which means that it will continue to have the funds needed to further improve the system and ensure that more and more people begin using their algorithm to successfully farm both Bitcoin and altcoins, while keeping the profit high and the losses low. The firm, which is also funded by Li Xiao Lai will also continue working on new technologies, thus taking what they have just released to the next level, and allowing people to do a lot more than just mining more cryptocurrencies at the same time with the help of a powerful script. With everything that has been outlined so far in mind, the release of the new service will be made in April 2015, right after the company finished clearing all the bugs out and making sure that it is viable for commercial release.

CEX.IO, once one the most popular Bitcoin cloud mining solutions, was forced to shut down mining operations late last year. And it looks like they have now also removed all trading fees on the platform in order to keep their customer base happy. Since CEX.IO had to suspend its cloud mining operations in 2014 \u2013 due to a very long period of unprofitability, which is still plaguing many other Bitcoin cloud mining services \u2013 the company has been focusing their attention on the Bitcoin exchange part of their platform. One of the first steps towards revamping the exchange part of their business model comes in the form of lowering trading fees from 0.2% to 0% for a limited time. In fact, this limited time offer will only be valid for one week and begins on March 25th, 2015 [until April 1st, 2015]. CEX.IO hopes to attract new people to the platform during this spell of 0% trading fees, which will in turn allows CEX to make new features available to as many people as possible. At the time of publication, it remains unclear as to what kind of unannounced features we can expect in the near future. One of the things that are in store for CEX.IO customers is a flexible fee system on the exchange part of the platform. Because of this flexible fee system, the commission per user will vary, as it totally dependant on each user\u2019s 30-day trading history. Last but not least, this fee will always be somewhere between 0.2% and 0.5%. While there are new features coming to CEX.IO in the future, the company has been improving various aspects of their platforms over the past few months. One of the main areas the company\u2019s engineers have been focused on is increasing the platform\u2019s overall security, as we have seen many Bitcoin-related attacks this year alone. But CEX.IO have opened themselves up to attacks because they allow customers to use credit and debit cards in order to purchase Bitcoin on their platform. To combat the risk of fraud, CEX has obtained a special certificate which helps businesses process these card transactions in a secure manner. This certificate \u2013 called Level 3 PCI DSS \u2013 a company has to be compliant with several other security factors. These factors include tight control in regards to the storage, processing and transmission of the credit/debit card holder\u2019s data. Given the number of hacked credit card details year after year, the Level 3 PCI DSS certificate is a great step forward for platforms working with card transactions.

This type of thinking led to several unique features to enhance the user experience. By far, the most significant of these dicing features is the experience system. Primedice has applied a full leveling system to their dice game. Players level up depending on their amount wagered, as well as their achievement progress. There are currently 28 different achievements for players to work towards while they are betting. These achievements cover a variety of categories, including: amount wagered, total profit, total number of bets, chat messages sent, users referred, total commissioned, and account age. Levels and achievements are also not purely aesthetic. The site also features their own faucet. This faucet can be claimed once every three minutes, and the amount claimed is proportionate to player levels. There are 40 levels in total, and the highest level players obtain 10k satoshi from their faucet every three minutes. The faucet payouts fixed to the leveling system give players an incentive outside of profit to continue dicing, which makes the overall experience more enjoyable and fun for the user. Primedice currently offers a flat 1% house edge on all odds. However, there is also a PVP system with a 0% edge. The player versus player dicing system allows Primedice users to challenge one another. They set the amount they wish to wager, and both players roll. The player who achieves the a higher roll wins the challenge, along with the amount that was agreed upon prior to the roll. Primedice does not keep any fees or rake from their PVP system, effectively making it the fairest way to gamble, as all players have exactly a 50% chance to double their money. Primedice is also known for sharing their profits with the community. Outside of the automatic faucet payouts, the site also holds frequent giveaways and promotions, both through the site and through Bitcointalk, Twitter, and Facebook. Stunna, the owner of primedice, will occasionally host giveaways, where .01 BTC or other small amounts are given to any primedice user who claims their giveaway on the thread or post where the giveaway is active. Another popular example, that has since been discontinued, were happy hours, where all users received a 10,000 satoshi faucet claim balance for the duration of the happy hour. Since its relatively recently release in May of 2013, Primedice has established themselves as the most popular bitcoin gambling site. The site boasts almost 900,000 bitcoin in total wagers, and over 4.4 billion total bets. Primedice is one of the best options out there for dicing and general bitcoin gambling. If you haven\u2019t done so already, give it a try today. You won\u2019t regret it.", "date": "2015-03-24T09:32:55+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 24}

What\u2019s even better is that AI can also be introduced on a wide spectrum of markets, which can in turn improve the current situation of a system. With this in mind, the last couple of days have brought in reports referring to the introduction of an Artificial Intelligence system over on the Blockchain, thanks to the new cryptocurrency and AI project known as Sapience AIFX. To put things better into perspective, by finding a smart way to combine modern AI with the technology which is in charge of operating the Blockchain and the peer-to-peer network that has revolutionized the bitcoin protocol, a concept that is unprecedented in today\u2019s market will be created. The project has also brought in a couple of other innovations including the fact that it has implemented the first distributed database platform, which is currently running directly over the peer-to-peer bitcoin protocol, which is also a great evolution, as it allows for a distributed hash table and trie-based indexing, which are both concepts that the cryptocurrency world has been lacking in a way or another until now, but which are also needed for the overall success of the market. Another great development refers to the fact that the Sapience AIFX project has also implemented the first in-wallet interactive Lua shell, which is basically a system that aims to grant developers from all around the world the ability to come up with build solutions, thus leveraging the Blockchain and providing blockchain singularity. Their influence will also probably extend over the multi-layer perceptron networks and distributed data storage, which all represent areas that not many have focused on until now. By finding a way to rebuild the Blockchain and repair most of its major issues, users will soon be able to get access to an unparalleled experience, driven forward by Sapience\u2019s engines. Overall, if successful, the project will improve the way we interact with the Blockchain and cryptocurrencies, but also bring over a market which provides an in-wallet experience that is also compatible with Counterparty protocols, which means that the cryptocurrency wallets of the future that we may have will not only be more secure, but they will also have a lot more features, which is an essential factor for the continuous development of the cryptocurrency. The Sapience AIFX project was founded by Joe Mozelesky, who is an expert in Artificial Intelligence, willing to set a new standard in a world, which has the great potential of being driven forward by cryptocurrencies in the near future. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, the structure and the wide variety of ideas that have been put into this project will not only greatly improve the overall experience of users from all around the world, but it will also increase the security and the decentralized status of most cryptocurrencies available at this moment in time.", "date": "2015-03-17T21:36:28+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 17}

LuckyBit, however, takes a different approach. Founded in October of 2013, LuckyBit is the epitome of simplicity. Like Plinko on The Price is Right, and Pachinko in many Asian casinos, LuckyBit is a variation of the bean machine, also known as Galton\u2019s Box. The website is simple; users can log into the chat box, copy the bet address of their choice at the bottom, and watch their bets, along with others, on the Plinko machine that takes up the majority of the page. The website layout has not changed since it launched. Instead of constantly coming up with new games, the developers behind the popular site elected to work on improving the game they had created, to work towards providing the best quality experience for the users as possible. The result of this is a game more suspenseful, intense, and satisfying than all others out there. From the website, players can choose from five different betting addresses, all of which are attached to different odds and payout percentages, and represented by a different color. Within seconds of sending your desired bet to the preferred address, a chip drops from the top of the screen, along with all other current active bets. Your chip, colored the same as the address you sent your bet to, bounces off pegs, slowly making its way down towards the bottom. Suspense builds, as your chips makes its way down each level, accompanied by a subtle chink. The further away your chip heads from the center, the better. Each progression away from the center is praised, and each towards is cursed. You can sort of calculate if your bet is going to come with profit or loss, but your fate is ultimately decided by which direction it falls from the last peg in most cases. Each bet keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the ding associated with a winning bet while become music to your ears. You will also learn to hate the clunk sound that represents all losses. There are four core betting levels: blue, green, yellow, and red. Each level represents a different payout and win chance, with blue being the safest, and red, the riskiest. There is also a fifth level, a white, \u201cpromo\u201d level, reserved for community created betting levels. LuckyBit is known for the power they give to their community. They share their profits with the people who stand by the community, through giveaways, promotions, and contests. The website has a \u201cchat lotto\u201d, which frequently gives out generous amounts of bitcoin to those simply participating in chat. The site also recently introduced shiny bonus chips, which represent a percentage of the site rake tacked on to the current bet. LuckyBit, although simple, is one of the most unique gambling experiences out there. Since launching in late 2013, the site has recorded over 1.1 million bets and over 49 thousand total bitcoins wagered. If you haven\u2019t done so already, give LuckyBit a try.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/merkle-io-the-google-of-digital-currencies/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Merkle.io \u2013 The Google of Digital Currencies", "content": "Late last night, I stumbled across an interesting new Bitcoin-related project called Merkle. Do not confuse this project with Merkle trees Bitcoin developers have been talking about for the past year or so though. Merkle is a Google-esque search engine for anything related to Bitcoin, whether it is news, charts or even creating a new address with a private key. When you open the Merkle.io website for the very first time, you might be shocked by what you see, as there isn\u2019t too much going on. Then again, if you open up the Google.com page for the very first time, you are presented with a nearly identical page. Granted, Google has a better logo than Merkle has, but that shouldn\u2019t matter much in terms of functionality. Merkle.io calls itself the \u201cGoogle for blockchains\u201d, and that is exactly what this search engine wants to become. Functionality is currently limited to Bitcoin only, but there are plans to hook into other coins\u2019 API\u2019s as well in the future in order to extend the same functionality to those coins. And there are some nifty features to be found when using Merkle. For instance, whenever you want to generate a new Bitcoin address, you can do it through Merkle. Simply open the website, enter \u201cgetnewaddress\u201d, and you will be presented with a new Bitcoin address and its very own private key. Whether or not Merkle stores all of this data somewhere is not clear at this point, so use this feature at your own risk for now. Are you looking for the current Bitcoin charts? Click on the \u201ccharts\u201d menu item on the left-hand side of your screen, and you are presented with the latest price charts. It has to be noted that, at the time of publication, the charts feature was still under development and currently shows fake data. However, it does give us an indication of what kind of information we will see on this page in the near future. Speaking of what we can expect to see on this page, the creator has also embedded a small news feed on the charts page. For the time being, it shows the latest CoinDesk news, but we can only hope to see other news outlets appear on this page as well. All in all, it\u2019s a good combination to show the price charts and the latest Bitcoin news on one and the same page, so kudos to the creator for doing so. Other features to be found on the Merkle website include looking up Bitcoin addresses and transactions, and a \u201cproof exploration feature\u201d will be coming soon. On the topic of new features being added, Merkle will soon be able to look up assets [such as colored coins] as well. Once all of these features have been rolled out, Merkle could prove to be a very versatile and valuable tool to digital currency enthusiasts. Note from the Author: For those of you wondering who is running the Merkle project, it is the same person who created Bitproof.io Website: https://merkle.io/", "date": "2015-03-21T10:29:08+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 21}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/coinbase-was-vulnerable-to-authy-2fa-exploit/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Coinbase Was Vulnerable to Authy 2FA Exploit", "content": "The woes and tribulations in the Bitcoin world are far from over, despite more and more positive news making headlines all across the world. Authy, a two-factor authentication protocol used by several Bitcoin platforms \u2013 including the Bitcoin exchange Coinbase \u2013 is prone to a bypass attack which could give unauthorized parties access to your account. When it comes to giving users the option of adding extra layers of security to their account, two-factor authentication is one of the most widely used solutions. Several companies are providing 2FA security solutions, such as Google, YubiKey, MePIN and Authy, to name a few. And we always assumed that 2FA could not be bypassed that easily, but apparently we were wrong. There are several problems going on with the Authy two-factor authentication system, which can also impact users of Bitcoin exchange Coinbase. As an attacker can bypass your Authy 2FA SMS verification quite easily, unauthorized access to your account is bound to happen at some point. But why is Authy so vulnerable? Authy does not encode the token from user parameters. Because of this major security flaw, Authy\u2019s API calls would let an attacker access someone else\u2019s account after overwriting the path to where the user token should be sent. Everything after the \u201c#\u201d symbol is ignored, effectively letting anyone bypass SMS two-factor authentication. Note from the Author: It is impossible for Authy to verify whether the request is legitimate or not on the server side. Authy-python is not as secure as everyone believed it to be either. In fact, it might be even easier to bypass Authy\u2019s SMS two-factor authentication completely. Because Authy-Python allows for path traversal, an attack would only need to add \u201c../SMS\u201d to turn the /verify API call into an \u201cAuthentication 200\u201d status, and effectively access the account unauthorized. URL encoding is futile. Authy uses Sinatra, which uses rack-protection by default. The path_traversal module in rack-protection decodes \u201c%2F\u201d to slashes, instead of a space. Needless to say, any API using Sinatra\u2019s rack-protection is affected by this vulnerability. To put it in simple terms: anyone can bypass an account\u2019s Authy two-factor SMS authentication by simply typing \u201c../SMS\u201d in the token field, instead of the SMS code. It doesn\u2019t take much skill once you know the weakness found in Authy\u2019s API calls, and the path_traversal module vulnerability was originally patched on February 8th of 2015. Popular Bitcoin exchange platform Coinbase uses both Authy and Google Authenticator for two-factor authentication. Luckily for Bitcoin users, the Authy vulnerability has been fixed already, and this trick no longer works. But it just goes to show you how vulnerable these login systems really are when relying on third-party API calls. It will be interesting to see how these kind of vulnerabilities will impact Bitcoin-related platforms in the future.

SWC has already become one of the largest poker operations, averaging a couple hundred players online at any given time. For a site that has only operated for a month, this is an impressive accomplishment. The immediate success of SWC, however, is a minuscule achievement in comparison to the story behind how SWC Poker came to be. Micon, the owner of SWC, is also one of the key figures of Seals With Clubs. Well, he was apart of Seals With Clubs, up until just last month, when the website was shut down. Launched in 2011, Seals With Clubs was one of the first bitcoin gambling operations, and over the years they had established themselves as the largest and most respected poker site among the community. February 11, 2015 was the day Seals shut down. Micon, a Las Vegas resident, was raided by 10 armed men, warranted by the Nevada Gaming Commission. Micon was escorted out of his home while the gunmen confiscated most of his technology. Most people would have nothing to do with the industry after such an event. In fact, that\u2019s what the team behind Seals did. After hearing the news of what happened to Micon, many people behind the website quit. They wanted nothing to do with the popular poker site, as they feared they would become victim to a similar situation in the near future. In the following days, only a few Seals operators remained. Immediately after the shut down, Micon went back to work. He packed his belongings, took his family, and moved to Antigua. A small island in the Caribbean, Micon chose this destination because he feels he can operate his new poker company without fear of government officials shutting down his legal business. From there, Micon gathered the devoted team members who stayed, hired several new recruits. Micon had assembled a new team to assist him, and went to work. Just nine days after Seals With Clubs was shut down, SWC was released. More than just a copy of the old website, SWC unveiled a new layout along with upgraded poker software. SWC Poker also launched with several new poker games that were not available on Seals. Among draw, stud, and mixed games, was the widely popular Open Face Chinese poker, which is currently one of the most popular games on the site, second only to no limit hold \u2019em. Within the first hours of release, SWC already surpassed 100 players online simultaneously. Low rake, flexible tables, generous GTD bonuses, and frequent free rolls are among the reasons why players choose to play on SWC Poker. For most players, however, its the people involved with the site. Micon is insanely dedicated to the improvement of his website. He works tirelessly to provide the best possible experience, and he has proven this passion through the recent events regarding him and his company. The SWC client is being improved on daily, with updates several times a week. From here, the website can and will only continue to improve, until it is undoubtedly the top bitcoin poker experience in the world.

It evolved from Summercoin V2 which was launched in May 2014. We have been following this cryptocurrency since July, 2014 when we reported about their proposed anonymous transaction technology using subchains. It all sounded like another gimmick feature which most scamcoins use in order to attract the attention of investors, however 6 months later, the development team started the beta test for the anonymous network. Here we are, 10 months after the launch of Navajocoin and today is the day that the asynchronous encryption technology that has been beta tested for 3 months will go live! Here is a brief overview of how the technology works: According to the official Navajocoin bitcointalk thread: The one thing that stands out as most impressive to us is the fact that Navajocoin\u2019s anonymous technology will use double encryption. This means that all communication between the API server, the NAV wallet and nodes will ben encrypted and sent over an SSL connection. As a result, anyone trying to sniff out the date being sent to and from your IP address will be presented with an indecipherable chunk of data. But that is not all, as this anonymous technology will also ensure that all recipient addresses [broadcasted via the blockchain] will be encrypted as well, by using the Asynchrous encryption key pair explained above. In regards to how this double encryption works, the developers explain it as follows: as soon as information is transmitted over the private subchain, the destination is decrypted and re-encrypted with a new asynchronous key pair shortly afterwards. This entire process will be done over a secure SSL connection as well. Asynchronous key pairs are replaced on the NAV anonymity servers frequently, in order to protect previous transactions in the event of a security breach. We will be closely following the Navajocoin development team for their release of the anon technology. If the release is successful then Navajocoin is a serious contender to Darkcoin, which is also an anonymous transaciton centric cryptocurrency.", "date": "2015-03-09T11:37:00+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 9}

Just a few days ago, Coinprism \u2013 a platform for colored coins \u2013 has announced their service is now compatible with the popular TREZOR Bitcoin hardware wallet. But what does it actually mean? A few weeks ago, TREZOR announced a software upgrade that includes smart property support. However, up until a few days ago, none of the existing \u201cBitcoin 200 platforms\u201d had implemented this feature as of yet. That is until Coinprism become the first platform to do s, in order to offer an additional layer of cold storage protection for their users. In doing so, Coinprism users can not only secure Bitcoins, but also colored coin assets in cold storage with their TREZOR hardware wallet. Protecting users\u2019 funds is a key focal point for every Bitcoin-related platform, but that is not the only good news. Coinprism users will also be able to spend Bitcoins and colored coin assets directly from the Coinprism website by using their TREZOR hardware wallet. And if that wasn\u2019t enough to win you over, additional functionalities will be at your disposal. For instance, storing asset insurance keys on your TREZOR is a new feature added to the Coinprism platform. On the other side of the medallion, you cannot ensure reissuance of assets without having physical access to your TREZOR wallet. Last but not least, some of the most important aspects of colored coin assets \u2013 such as voting, dividends and crowd sales \u2013 will be compatible with TREZOR as well. If you are one of the many TREZOR owners, you don\u2019t have to do many things differently compared to using the Coinprism platform without a hardware wallet. Once your account on the platform has been created, generate an address managed by your TREZOR hardware wallet and label it something like \u201cMy Trezor wallet\u201d. Most of you will be aware of the fact that a TREZOR Bitcoin hardware wallet has 20 slots for unique addresses. Select one of the available slots on your device (after making sure the TREZOR is properly connected to your computer) and click on the \u201cLoad from TREZOR\u201d button in your Coinprism account. Once your device has been identified successfully, your public key will be imported from the TREZOR. Note from the Author: If you are using the Chrome browser to use your TREZOR on the Coinprism platform for the very first time, make sure to \u201cUnblock plugins\u201d when prompted. Signing transactions on the Coinprism platform with your TREZOR hardware wallet works exactly the same as with a regular transaction. Connect your TREZOR to the computer, press \u201cSign\u201d, and enter your pin code is applicable. This pin code must be entered by using the matrix on the device display which correlates with the matrix image on the screen. After signing a transaction, it will be broadcasted on the Bitcoin network.

While we have seen several partnerships being created as of late, the most significant to date might be the one between Bitnation, the Blocknet and Horizon. The power of the blockchain is vastly underestimated by traditional institutions around the world, as they feel that all of this transparency is not beneficial to the world\u2019s population. However, a lot of people both inside and outside of the Bitcoin space seem to think otherwise, and this partnership is just one of the examples of what can be achieved. A voluntary form of governance may sound like an idea that is destined to fail, but because of its borderless and decentralized nature, the outcome may differ. Let\u2019s face it, the current infrastructure benefits only a certain percentage of the global population, and is proving to be a pain in the neck for billions of people all around the world. It may be hard for us living in the Western world to imagine, but there are still many places in the world where you can not prove your identity, legally own your house or even get economic protection. Blockchain technology has evolved over the past six years, and various developers and companies are looking at ways to use this protocol for storing data, creating records, smart contracts and even proof of ownership. All that is needed to take things to the next level is the creation of a comprehensible platform to deliver this technology to the everyday person. BitNation is a well-known name in the world of digital currency, as they are the world\u2019s first virtual nation providing actual governance services. Several BitNation Ambassadors can be found around the world, and they are all very passionate about the project. In fact, the beta version of the BitNation platform [called BitNation Pangea] will launch this month, although an exact date has not been confirmed yet. You may remember the BitNation name from events such as the world\u2019s first Blockchain Marriage and the world\u2019s first World Citizen ID on the blockchain. \u201cBitnation is a revolutionary idea, an idea which we believe will radically change the world for the better. However, being the first in the world to challenge the nation state construct head-on through providing better services using blockchain technology, it is not always easy to implement. It\u2019s a broad and bold vision. Hence, partnering with Horizon and the Blocknet provides a very solid foundation \u2014 they\u2019re organizations we believe in and have the deepest respect for. They give us amazing technology and a group of wonderful individuals to work with. We have been working together for some time now, and I\u2019ve always been struck by the professionalism of Horizon and the Blocknet \u2013 they\u2019re very solid people, with clear and consistent values, and a high level of integrity.\u201d Horizon is a digital currency project striving to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and the real world by using a reputation system. While blockchain technology offers a lot of options in regards to digital goods and assets changing hands, the story is a bit different for physical goods and assets. As a result, practical applicability remains an issue. However, that problem will be sorted by the Horizon developers, as they weave blockchains into the non-digital world by using algorithmic reputation scoring. The main goal of this reputation system is to incentivize people to honor blockchain-based agreements, otherwise their reputation will take a big hit. \u201cThe entire Horizon team has looked forward to working alongside the Bitnation team because they embody the spirit of the decentralization movement. The focus of both Horizon and Bitnation has been to develop decentralized and innovative technology that allows people to break away from conventional services, and cut the middleman out of the picture. While working together to accomplish these goals with some of the most committed and talented developers, and communities behind them, we look forward to strengthening our partnership and delivering the most disruptive, user friendly and decentralized products and services possible.\u201d You also have to keep in mind there is a bridge between one blockchain and the next, as these chains are not designed to communicate with one another directly. This is where the BlockNet comes in, as their developers can network various blockchains together in order to avoid \u201cblockchain bloat\u201d. Furthermore, the BlockNet offers technology of one chain being delivered as a service of nodes on any other chain \u2013 effectively creating an \u201cInternet of blockchains\u201d. \u201cBitnation is a groundbreaking concept, and we\u2019re very excited to provide a platform for it to be developed upon. Horizon too is a powerful Blocknet-enabled project with the highest node count of all cryptocurrencies, except Bitcoin. We believe that the Blocknet, by enabling open ended inter-chain services, unlocks the full potential of blockchain-based technology. With Bitnation, Horizon, and the Blocknet working together, the potential is truly vast.

OKCoin, China\u2019s second largest Bitcoin exchange platform, has seen several of it\u2019s top executives leave the company over the past few weeks. That does make you wonder what is going on there, no? When your company\u2019s Chief Technical Officer plans to resign [and thinks better of it] and OKCoin doesn\u2019t find it necessary to issue a public statement on his departure, because of a \u201cverbal agreement\u201d. However, OKCoin does with Mr. Zhao the best in his future endeavours, due to a difference regarding the perspective and future of the industry. OKCoin is also quickly to assess that, while Changpeng Zhao has been a superb colleague, his departure will not affect the company much. Several co-workers are apparently more than capable of filling the CTO role without naming a successor just yet. However, OKCoin will cooperate with as many parties as possible in 2015 to increase the company\u2019s transparency. Some of you may remember the name of Zane Tackett, as he won the 2014 award for Best Community Engagement by a Bitcoin Exchange Representative. Things have changed dramatically ever since, and Mr. Tackett left OKCoin for the same reason as Changpeng Zhao \u2013 different direction and perspective in the industry. Either two brilliant people got a better offer at nearly the same time, or OKCoin will be heading in a direction none of the top brass likes too much. Without trying to sound worried or anything, when your company\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer leaves for unknown [or undisclosed] reasons, things are not looking too bright. No one saw his departure coming, as he was part of a recent OKCoin AUA [Ask us Anything] on Reddit, which you can find out more about by clicking here. Very little information has been revealed as to why these three names have parted ways with the company.

But what about Nika, the Team Lead of OKCoin Customer Service who suddenly vanished despite representing OKCoin at the Bitcoin Conference in St. Petersburg a few weeks prior? All signs are pointing towards an internal storm brewing over at OKCoin headquarters, and everyone is keeping their lips sealed for the time being.

Cloud mining operators need a BTC price of at least US$320 in order to be profitable, and mining at home becomes increasingly difficult due to high electricity prices. Plus, the upfront investment required to buy mining hardware is making a lot of people second-guess their \u00f9oning plans. Alcheminer, a manufacturer of Scrypt mining hardware, has recently slashed their prices in order to attract more customers. When it comes to mining Scrypt-based alternate currencies, the choices for finding a somewhat profitable coin are fairly limited. However, when a mining hardware manufacturer such as Alcheminer decides to lower prices significantly, it can spur a fresh round of interest from people looking to upgrade current hardware, or venture into the world of digital currency mining for the first time. As always with this kind of deals, they are only available for a limited time. But the best part is that both miners that are on sale right now are in stock and ready to be shipped to your doorstep. Considering these Alchemist machines only consume 8W per MH/s,, they are some of the lowest power mining devices on the market today. Deal 1 : Alchemist 96MH/s \u2013 US$1,199 instead of US$2,500 -excluding S&H, Import VAT 900W at the wall \u2013 the weight of 13.6 kg \u2013 PSU not included Deal 2: Alchemist 256MH/s \u2013 US$3,099 instead of US$6,500 \u2013 excluding S&H, Import VAT 2,200W at the wall \u2013 the weight of 21.5 kg \u2013 PSU not included Considering the Alcheminer company is located in Taipei, Taiwan; customers better prepare for paying a hefty chunk of import VAT when ordering one of these devices. These fees will depend on your location and weight of the package, so take these into consideration before making a purchase on the Alcheminer website. Unlike most traditional mining manufacturing companies, Alcheminer does not accept Bitcoin payments for any of their orders. Instead, customers have to pay for an[international] bank transfer, which may be subject to additional fees. It is also important to notice that full payment is required before your Scrypt miner is shipped to your address. It remains to be seen whether the price reduction brings new or returning customers to Alcheminer, as the Scrypt mining landscape remains in an unprofitable state right now. On top of that, the options for mining Scrypt coins is fairly limited, which is another factor to take into consideration. Will you purchase any of the miners on sale from Alcheminer?

This left many finding the mining application sucking up all free CPU power and left many users completely quiting the application in protest against the company for installing third party applications with out user approval. Highlighting many of the conflicts, the recent update brought in the Epic Scale Cryptocurrency miner. However to many this has come as unwelcome news and a bad move on uTorrents part. Even Though the miners can be uninstalled from the control panel, Windows users can find or delete the application in Add/Remove Programs and remove any residual files in C:ProgramDataEpicscale.\u201d , the update has sparked outrage as users had no chance to opt out of the installation of the miner which was installed as a third party application. Resonating malware which installed miners onto unsuspecting computers which generated money for operators, the current situation has provoked outrage and has also force uTorrent to release the following statement clarifying the situation. The intentions of the miner have been applauded by many as the use of Bitcoin for charity has been highlighted by a number of corporations. Initially Humble INC have been the major players, accepting Bitcoin for charity donations whilst allowing customers to grab some games at ridiculous prices. THis site has remained as one of the most popular sites for the gaming community, simultaneously using Bitcoin as a payment method. Whilst uTorrents intentions may have been good, many users have also brought to light that cryptocurrency mining applications are commonly unwanted as generally they use more electricity and are associated with hackers and other vermin attempting to make money of your system. However with the cryptocurrency mining application thought to be for the benefits of charities it is hoped that the application will be accepted by users of the new update. While many question the integrity of uTorrent, who have on many occasions mentioned third party applications should not be installed without user permission, this further highlights the importance of cryptocurrencies in a beneficial nature as they can help in countless industries for countless operations.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/coinbase-hits-2-1m-users-milestone/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Coinbase Hits 2.1m Users Milestone", "content": "According to some recent statistics publicly displayed on the Coinbase website, the company is claiming to have 2.1 million users. That is quite a staggering number for a company that has been founded in July of 2012, even though we had seen a tremendous growth in users on a monthly basis. But are these numbers true or fake? Coinbase is very transparent in displaying their user statistics on the website, yet there is no way to verify any of that data directly. However, according to the company, there are 2.1 million user accounts and 2.6 million Bitcoin wallet addresses registered on the Coinbase platform. Those numbers to seem to add up, as not every user needs more than one wallet address. But when you start putting things in perspective, these numbers may seem slight out of context. Granted, Coinbase offers its services is over 20 countries around the world, so there is a certain global reach to take note of. Despite all of that, you have to keep in mind that Coinbase is still mostly serving US-based customers [not including Canada, as their service si not operational there for the time being]. Let\u2019s assume \u2013 for the sake of argument \u2013 that 75% of the Coinbase customer database is based in the United States. 75% Of their 2.1 million users equals to 1,575000 customers in the United States alone. And as far as I know, you cannot create more than one account with the same identity, so they would be legitimately serving over one and a half million American customers and businesses. Taking into account there are 320,480,000 people living in the continent United States alone, Coinbase services would be used by roughly 0.5% of the American population. Or to put that number into a different perspective, one in 200 people in the United States knows about Bitcoin AND has created a Coinbase account at some point between July 2012 and today. Numbers like these do make you wonder how many of these 2.1 million accounts have ever been actively used though. Just because someone signs up for a service does not make them an active user. However, it does go to show there are a lot of people who took the time to check out what Coinbase had to offer for them as an individual or as a business. One of the things no one can deny is the fact that Coinbase is a popular Bitcoin payment processing company for a lot of businesses. In fact, their recent statistics show that no less than 38,000 merchants are making use of Coinbase\u2019s transaction processing. That number will most certainly grow over the next few years, as we see an increase in Bitcoin adoption. It will be interesting to see if the Coinbase account numbers will grow proportionally to the number of merchants using their platform to process Bitcoin payments. Are you a Coinbase user? If so, what do you like or dislike about their service the most? Leave a comment below!

Whether you mined at home, bought a contract from a cloud mining operator or even rented another miner\u2019s hashrate, there was usually a chance to make a small profit in a short timespan. With the falling Bitcoin price, the mining landscape has changed drastically, and a lot of digital currency enthusiasts are looking for other options to make money. However, several companies involved in selling or renting out mining hashpower are making tremendous efforts in order to make digital currency mining more appealing. Some companies are offering lower contract prices [by slashing maintenance fees to a bare minimum]. Yet BetaRigs, a service where miners can buy and sell mining power on the open market, is trying something entirely different. When it comes to mining at home, most miners either stuck with mining one coin \u2013 such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin or Darkcoin \u2013 while others diversified their mining portfolio. In order to do so, you would need to own a decent mining operation, which requires a hefty chunk of investment capital. As Bitcoin and altcoin prices started declining over the past year, platforms such as BetaRigs started appearing, giving mining hardware owners a new platform to create some form of passive revenue. By letting miners sell [a portion of] their mining hashpower, a new breed of market was born. True to the decentralized nature of digital currency, BetaRigs users can conduct peer-to-peer transactions on the open market to buy and hashrate for multiple specific mining algorithms, such as SHA-256, Scrypt, Groestl and X11/13/15. Unfortunately, services such as BetaRigs were not spared from the decline in Bitcoin and altcoin values, and the platform owners had to come up with a new feature to attract more people. As a result, BetaRigs recently announced a new contract rental feature allowing BetaRigs customers to rent out mining power to customers of the cloud mining platform Mintsy. For those of you who have never heard of cloud mining platform Mintsy, allow me to explain where they are coming from. Back in September of 2014, a joint venture between digital currency exchange platform Cryptsy and innovative digital payment solutions company DigitalBTC was announced, which resulted in the birth of the Mintsy cloud mining platform. Even though the Mintsy cloud mining platform is currently still in its beta phase, the partnership with BetaRigs will allow the company to wrap up beta testing and transition to a fully operational business. Needless to say, given the current digital currency cloud mining situation, this is a gutsy move by the Mintsy owners, and it will definitely be interesting to see how this will play out. In fact, BetaRigs customers will have the option of trading and splitting up their hash rates. For example, if you have a Bitcoin ASIC miner at your disposal, you could split up the machine\u2019s total hashpower into two or three or four different mining contracts. This feature will be made available thanks to Mintsy technology merging with the service offered by BetaRigs. The partnership between betaRigs and Mintsy comes at an opportune time for the mining rental platform, as ownership of the service changed hands little over a month ago. Unfortunately, that transition didn\u2019t go as smooth as planned, and the platform experienced some operational issues as part of the transition. later on, several platform upgrades caused additional downtimes, forcing the BetaRigs owners to refund their customers.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/butterfly-labs-liquidates-assets-craigslist/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Butterfly Labs Liquidates Assets on Craigslist", "content": "Butterfly Labs is a very infamous company in the world of Bitcoin and digital currency. Not only because of their Bitcoin ASIC manufacturing, but more notable for their inability to deliver products to customers. Things even took a turn for the worse when BFL announced their new cloud mining contracts just a few weeks ago. And right now, it looks like the company is selling off some of their \u201cleftover\u201d assets on Craigslist. The Bitcoin subreddit is filled with all types of people : enthusiasts, crypto anarchists, people who truly despise Bitcoin and everything it stands for; but also a lot of people who can put two and two together. And it is because of those intelligent people we can bring you the news about Butterfly Labs selling off some of their hardware assets on Craigslist. The assets in question are ASUS 16GB Nexus 7 tablets, which all have the Butterfly Labs application pre-installed on the device. These tablets were sued by Butterfly Labs in order to monitor their Bitcoin ASIC\u2019s while mining, which is a trend we have seen evolve over the past year or so. One of the main benefits of operating this way is that your mining hardware no longer needs to be connected directly to a computer, as all information can be relayed via the tablet. According to the Craigslist listing, Butterfly Labs is looking to sell off at least 20 ASUS Google Nexus 7 tablets, at the price of US$69 each, which is pretty cheap at this point in time. An additional OTG (On the Go) cable to charge the ASUS tablet with any other device will be provided for an additional cost of US$10. All purchases come with the original instruction manual , warranty and charger cable. Just because these tablets are being sold in a large quantity, and come with the Butterfly Labs application pre-installed, doesn\u2019t mean that BFL is actually selling off their assets. However, the seller\u2019s address listed on Craigslist is the exact same address as Butterfly Labs\u2019 Headquarters at 10770 El Monte St,Leawood,Kansas. Not just a mere coincidence if you ask me. After all, we all know that Butterfly Labs is currently in legal trouble with the court case against them. As the company has to start refunding their customers, they need to secure an additional influx of revenue, and selling off these unused ASUS Nexus 7 tablets might play a factor. Or it might be for a different reason altogether, I\u2019ll leave that to our readers to decide. It is a rather strange timing to sell these tablets right now, especially considering how Butterfly Labs has recently announced they would start offering Bitcoin Cloud mining contracts. Unless they are liquidating excess tablets from unused hardware, it does raise a few questions regarding their Bitcoin cloud mining operations. What are your thoughts on this Craigslist advert?

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/exclusive-interview-owner-fxcompared/", "author": "Daniel Dob", "title": "Exclusive Interview With The Owner Of FXcompared", "content": "Today, we welcome a very special guest named Daniel Webber, who is the managing director for Fxcompared, a trusted, independent, but also research-driven service that has the main purpose of ensuring that people from all around the world find it easier when making decisions about international money transfers. As this has represented a broadly-known issue in the past, today we will try our best to answer some important questions, which may be able to shed some light onto what it takes to find the perfect exchange and/or money transfer service and how companies such as Fxcompared are hard at work as an effort to ensure that the process is made significantly easier. When did you establish FXcompared? Fxcompared was established in the year of 2010. What is it that your company wishes to provide people from all around the world with? A trusted, independent, research-driven service to help individuals and businesses make smart decisions about their international money transfers. How popular would you consider your site from a scale from 1 to 10? We are not an exchange, more of a comparison service. Kayak for money transfer, so on a scale for 1 to 10, I would place it at 8. What are your current thoughts on Bitcoin? Bitcoin is in its very early stages. Individuals and businesses are still working out how to use Bitcoin, what it may mean for them and how it might replace more mainstream currencies they are using. At the moment, Bitcoin does not have the trust or understanding of the mainstream financial markets. Once it achieves this and becomes less volatile, there is great potential for Bitcoin to be a more commonly used currency. Do you think that the cryptocurrency has the potential of becoming the world\u2019s universal currency? There are many reasons why countries will want and need to retain their own currencies. A single currency used by multiple countries, as we have seen with the Euro, requires a lot more integration to work that just all agreeing to use that currency. It is a political question \u2013 do countries want to share a currency and a monetary and fiscal policy issue too. Additionally, Bitcoin would have to replace the Dollar as the number one traded global currency and this does not seem likely to happen any time soon. Do you plan on offering Bitcoin services over on FXcompared? We are always looking at new currencies and products to add to the site. Have you ever invested in Bitcoin? If yes, where you one of the lucky ones to have Bitcoin stored last year, when the value for one coin reached $1200? No, I have not made any investment in Bitcoin so far. What do you think that the perfect Bitcoin price is? I\u2019m an economist by background so for me, it has to be the price that is set in the market. Do you currently pay for anything with the use of the cryptocurrency? Not at the moment. If you had to make a guess, why do you think that Bitcoin is not fully mainstream yet? Bitcoin lacks the trust and understanding of the average consumer and business. It also lacks consistent regulation. One will likely support the other. Bitcoin\u2019s volatility at the moment has also made it a very risky currency to do business in. The public collapse of various Bitcoin exchanges does not help either. If you will start offering Bitcoin exchange services on your website, what would the security procedures be? How would you fight those money laundering and using Bitcoin for illegal activities? We would not treat a Bitcoin exchange any different to any other provider on our site. They would have go through the same business, legal, financial, regulatory and product checks that we cover for all our partners. Thank you very much, Daniel. That brings an end to our interview. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, chances are that when services such as the ones provide by Fxcompared become more popular, transferring money internationally will be a better experience from all the points of view. Not only will fishy companies which live by scamming people and charging large taxes disappear, but they will also be replaced by firms capable of providing legit services, while also keeping a close eye on the security and privacy of their users.", "date": "2015-03-05T21:28:13+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 3, "day": 5}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/exclusive-interview-rick-day-owner-igot-exchange/", "author": "Daniel Dob", "title": "Exclusive Interview With Rick Day, The Owner Of The iGot Exchange", "content": "An interesting study has shown that Bitcoin users from all around the world face trouble when it comes down to finding the perfect exchange which is willing to exchange Bitcoin to other currencies and vice versa for a good price. We have recently carried out an interview with Rick Day, who happens to be the owner of iGot exchange- a great choice for those who are seeking good rates, a great interface and professional customer support. To start things off, what got you into Bitcoin? What was the one thing which made you say \u2018I have to try this out\u2019? I heard about Bitcoin in 2010. I thought it had a future. One thing that got me was the speed. But at the same time buying Bitcoin was a very cumbersome process back then. Then in 2013 when the value went up so much, I truly wanted to do something and offer a service that would make buying Bitcoin easier. Was your site, iGot exchange an investment? If yes, what made you pick Bitcoin trading from all other possibilities? iGot is bootstrapped for the most part. I wanted to offer a service that was easier to use. Mt Gox was the only exchange back then I thought we could do much better than those guys in terms of making it easier to buy bitcoin and overall customer experience. Were you one of the lucky ones with Bitcoins stored when the prices went up all the way? (-$1200) Yes, I was one of the lucky one who had some Bitcoin at that price point, but did not sell it. As I am a big believer of Bitcoin, I am more interested in the future of Bitcoin than short term price speculation to be honest. What is your overall mission with the site and the firm? iGot is actively eyeing the global remittance market. Bitcoin has a great use case to send money across the border. It is much faster, much cheaper, and much cleaner. No one likes to wait for their funds. When someone transfers money, they want to see the transaction through right away. Bitcoin makes that possible. In 2012, over 500 Billion Dollars were sent across the borders worldwide. Some $47 Billion were collected in fees alone. World Bank estimates that as much as 60% of cross border transactions were carried physically. Bitcoin offers to solve this problem and iGot plans to use this tool to make global transfers much easier. iGot also offers \u2018Global Transfer\u2019 service that uses Bitcoin as the backbone. We\u2019re present in 40+ countries with local banking relationship. For verified accounts, we\u2019re able to allow our users to send money from country A to B using igot and the Bitcoin network. We\u2019re the only exchange in UAE and the biggest one in India (by trade volumes). UAE to India remittance corridor is the second highest in remittance market. Given our presence in both countries, we see lots of activity there already. For us, remittance market is potentially a $3 Billion market waiting to be tapped. One of iGot\u2019s core offerings right now is buying and selling Bitcoin. We will continue to pursue that. We see steady growth here and continue to grow nearly 30% month over month. We continue to introduce new features to iGot to attract not only the seasoned Bitcoin traders, but also everyday people who may have heard about Bitcoin but want to use it with ease and for something other than just speculating. Our Pay your Bill and Pay your Rent with Bitcoin feature has performed really well in the Australian market. We will roll it out to other markets as well. We\u2019re in process of launching merchant feature for retailers around the world to accept Bitcoin. With flat rate of 0.50% per transaction, we expect this to perform very well in Australia, India, and UAE. Indian ecommerce has soared in the past 5 years and we are in process of integrating some big names there to accept Bitcoin as payment method. Companies like Flipkart (raised $700M this past year), Amazon, eBay, and many more are very active there and it makes sense for Indian ecommerce to start accepting Bitcoin. We want to be their obvious choice in the local market to accept Bitcoin. Where do you see yourself and iGot exchange in the next 5 years? I\u2019d like to think that we become one of the biggest global players in the next 5 years. There is definitely a market for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and we will continue to introduce relevant features to our platform for mass audience, who are not yet using Bitcoin in any way at all. How big is your team at this moment in time? We\u2019re 12 team members at this time. The team keeps growing as our exchange grows. Does your legal team have a hard time when it comes down to dealing with the regulations? Compliance issues in different jurisdictions are complex. It is not exactly walk in the park for our legal team but authorities so far have been very helpful and open about Bitcoin and that helps a lot. As you may know, Coinbase is currently registered in around 40 states. Based on the fact that state registration as a money transmitter is both expensive, but also hard to get, do you plan on registering iGot in all 50 states? Regulatory requirements in US are expensive and a very cumbersome process. Our plan is to launch in the US in due course. We will have all the relevant licenses in place. We may roll out slowly to begin with. Have you ever thought about quitting once a problem appeared within the team or with the site? Not at all. We\u2019re in this for the long haul. Our team is young, passionate, and big believer of Bitcoin ecosystem. We\u2019re a start-up in a start-up industry. Of course there are teething problems associated with the industry itself, but that\u2019s no reason to quit. Based on your experience so far, who controls the Bitcoin price? Is it the users and their buying power or is there something more to this? For more part the users control the pricing. Every now and then you see a really big user who buys or sells and disrupts the market price. Exchanges play some role too without a doubt. Around how often do you find yourself using the coin to pay for things outside the Internet? I try and shop, dine, fly, and stay where Bitcoin is accepted as often as I can. We pay 75% of our salaries in Bitcoin too. If you could make a guess, do you think that the Bitcoin price will continue to fluctuate @ the $230 value, or is a big increase like the one in 2014 bound to happen all over again? My guess would be that it will either settle around $200 mark or go up to $260. Prices are waiting to swing one or the other way. It has been around $230 / $240 mark too long. But don\u2019t take my word for it. It\u2019s my personal opinion! What are our thoughts on Bitcoin used in illegal activities? Should there be laws regulating this important aspect? Should suspicious activity be marked by wallet providers? Most legitimate exchanges are already doing what\u2019s right, legal, and lawful. We collect KYC, we employ compliance officers to help us detect money laundering, and suspicious user behaviour too. I think some regulatory body looking over the industry is going to be a good thing. As far as illegal activities are concerned, Bitcoin is not the problem. Cash is! If yes, what would define suspicious activity? I can\u2019t give that away! But there are some 50+ check points at our exchange alone. Have you ever purchased something valuable in the offline environment with the help of Bitcoin? (a car for example) No, but I attempted to sell my house for Bitcoin. Unfortunately, I had to settle for fiat. Do you see your exchange being used by millions of Bitcoin enthusiasts? Hopefully! Would I like that? Of course! I am optimistic we will get closer soon. What would be the ideal Bitcoin price in your opinion? I think $265 to $300 would be ideal price point. Should banks go ahead and start offering customers Bitcoin accounts? They can\u2019t even they wanted to. The regulatory requirements for banks and financial risks are way too big for them to open Bitcoin accounts and let users save Bitcoin. Lack of clear regulations is another reason why banks won\u2019t touch it yet. How do you protect the privacy of your customers on iGot? Our privacy policy is listed here \u2013 https://www.igot.com/pages/privacy-policy Thank you very much, Rick. This brings an end to our interview. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, we can clearly see that Bitcoin exchanges are more secure than we have previously thought. Additionally, people just like Rick can easily find ways to use it in the online environment as well. With this factor in mind, the growth of exchanges like iGot will not only encourage more and more people to buy and use Bitcoin, but it\u2019ll also encourage companies to start accepting and granting payments in the cryptocurrency.", "date": "2015-02-26T20:06:18+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 26}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitpay-expensive-customers-compared-coinbase/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Is Bitpay More Expensive For Customers Compared To CoinBase?", "content": "When it comes to accepting Bitcoin as a payment method for goods and services, there are multiple payment processing options to choose from. CoinPayments is pretty straight forward and lets you accept alternate digital currencies as well. BitPay is the world\u2019s leading Bitcoin payment processor to date because of their excellent services. And Coinbase lets you buy and sell Bitcoin as well as use it to accept digital currency payments. But what sets these last two apart other than the services offered? Both Bitpay and coinBase allow merchants to accept Bitcoin payments in a simple and elegant way, whether it is online [by editing a few lines of code] or in-store [with software or a point-of-sale terminal]. And both companies seem to operate in roughly the same areas, most notably North America and Europe. One of the things BitPay has going for them is their brand awareness. Even though most people in the Bitcoin space have heard of CoinBase, people who are not involved with digital currency will most likely only encounter the BitPay name. Due to BitPay\u2019s strong brand building \u2013 such as sponsoring the St. Petersburg Bowl for three years and running a few commercials on national television \u2013 they seem to have a leg up over their competitors. But what if there was another major difference between both platforms, something we should be all aware of but no one seems to pay attention to it? As both companies process Bitcoin payments, they need to use a certain source to check the current Bitcoin price in fiat currency, and give the customer a quote on how much Bitcoin he or she has to pay to cover the amount owed to the merchant. It is safe to assume that both companies use a different source to determine the current exchange rate. Given Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility, it is important to have an accurate conversion rate between fiat and BTC, otherwise BitPay and CoinBase stand to lose a lot of money. After all, both companies owe the merchant the exact amount of the transaction,regardless of the current Bitcoin price. Exchange Rate Differences Picture the following situation : you are buying a certain gift card on Gyft.com, an online store accepting Bitcoin payments. The unique feature about Gyft is the fact they allow customers to pay in Bitcoin through either BitPay or CoinBase. it is not often that we see one retailer using both platforms to process a Bitcoin transaction, but it will serve us perfectly in this case. When I tried to purchase a US$50 Amazon.com gift card on Gyft, I noticed something very strange. There is a Bitcoin price discrepancy between both CoinBase and BitPay, which can become quite large depending on your order amount. On the amount of US$50, the difference between both servicers is 0.0008 Bitcoin, or about US$0.19 at the Bitcoin price of US$236.92 That amount may seem rather insignificant to you right now, but it does beg the question where this difference is coming from. BitPay operates on a 0% fee structure, so the US$0.19 can\u2019t be counted towards covering any fees. There is only one possible explanation for this : BitPay\u2019s Bitcoin price estimate is either delayed compared to the current price, or they are using an exchange where the price is higher than the average right now. But all of that leads to another question : are customers paying too much when the merchant of their choice accepts payments through BitPay? For microtransactions below US$100, hardly anyone will care about how much they are actually paying.

Due to a security breach, the SWC team decided to take this drastic course of action, and let users withdraw all of their funds. However, SealsWithClubs Chairman Bryan Micon posted a cryptic message about potentially relaunching the service under a different name. From the information we have received, we can gather this new website will be called SWCPoker.What might be even more baffling is the fact that users who earned \u201cKrill\u201d from actively playing over at SealsWithClubs, will be able to transfer this credit over to the SWCPoker site without any additional fees. For those of you who have never played at SealsWithClubs, you would earn Krill by actively playing poker on the website. Furthermore, the more Krill you collected, the more freerolls would open up for you to participate in. It has not yet been confirmed whether or not SWCPoker will inherit the same system, but seeing how Krill can be transferred, it is safe to assume a similar service will be available on the platform. According to sources on Twitter, it remains sad to see SealsWithClubs go, but SWCPoker will be offering a far superior service compared to SWC. Some people even go as far as saying this is the first site to offer \u201cBitcoin Poker 2.0\u201d. At this point in time, it remains rather unclear as to what possible advantages SWCPoker could offer compared to SealsWithClubs, but once the site fully launches, more testimonials will start appearing on the internet. With the biggest Bitcoin poker site closing its doors, there is a power vacuum in this niche market. Granted, there are several other poker sites out there that are also accepting Bitcoin as a payment method, yet none of those platforms has managed to gain the same traction in the overall Bitcoin community like SealsWithClubs had. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSH-pE3DHsw", "date": "2015-02-21T20:45:24+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 2, "day": 21}

With one of the biggest Bitcoin news providers now wound up on this story, evidence is trickling in of a conspiracy as The CoinTelegraph is fighting off allegations of plagiarism. Whilst many of the large and reputable sites like BTCFeed, CryptoCoinsNews and CoinDesk pride themselves in providing users with fresh and daily content from all around the Bitcoin world, it has become apparent not all companies play by the rules. It has emerged that CoinTelegraph plagiarized a huge chunk of content from Lazy News. The small Bitcoin site which serves a sizable amount of users initially noticed how a list central to the article was copied word for word from their site. Whilst this may have been deemed acceptable if it was included as a quote and the Lazy News source referenced clearly not only linked, CoinTelegraph attempted to mislead users by copying content without mentioning the real creditors outright, but embedding them insignificantly. This unethical news practice plagues even the biggest corporations in real life but to see it apparent in the Bitcoin news sector is absolutely shocking. The news has just proved how the Bitcoin Industry is prone to all kinds of negative acts, with plagiarism just being one in a whole host of fraud, scams and various other crimes. With the journalism industry now affected it seems as if the site operators are hiding behind a velvet cover of anonymity provided by Bitcoin. With users of Bitcoin extra careful it seems as if CoinTelegraph thought it could get away with plagiarism as the writer can simply change his name and carry on writing. This is also one instance where reputation was used to provide cover as the company thought a insignificant news site like Lazy Coins would never dare place a accusation of this sort forward, but as the site spoke out CoinTelegraphs reputation started its ride downward. Speculation Whilst users were fast to spot the plagiarized content it can be assured that the hunt for rogue Bitcoin news operators is on. With plagiarism not on damaging and unethical, it can effectively derail the reputation created by the site. The site once known for its fresh and unique content now has the mark of plagiarism firmly stamped on it and a loss of visitors and viewers is likely even if it may be mild.

Luckily for Bitcoin enthusiasts, there are plenty of Bitcoin wallet solutions available right now, and even more will see the light of day in 2015. But merchants could also benefit from a mobile Bitcoin application, especially if they signed up with a service such as CoinBase \u2013 which thankfully offers a mobile app for both Android and iOS users. And to further improve their services, as well as expand their global base of operations, CoinBase has added support for eleven new languages to their mobile application. Because Bitcoin is such a global currency which operates beyond national borders, and does not care who you are, how old you are or what your religion is, it has become a worldwide phenomenon. One thing most of us in the Western world tend to forget is that not everyone is as well-versed in the English language as most of us [especially in underbanked countries]. CoinBase acknowledged that situation, and has therefore undertaken the necessary steps to offer a localized version of the mobile application to their customer base. Among these eleven new languages, we find Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Korean, Japanese, French, Spanish and Russian. Especially Russian is an interesting choice, given the country\u2019s negative stance on Bitcoin and digital currencies at this moment. A new trend has emerged during the end of 2014 and early 2015, where we see \u201cBits\u201d becoming a new denomination for pieces of a Bitcoin. Such a trend does not go by unnoticed by the \u201cestablished\u201d brands in the Bitcoin sphere either, which is why CoinBase added support for \u201cbits\u201d as a unit of bitcoin currency for their mobile application.. Both iOS and Android users can now denominate their Bitcoin wallet in \u201cbits\u201d, by going to \u201cSettings\u201d in the CoinBase application, and then selecting the \u201cBitcoin Units\u201d option. Providing a proper user experience on Android tablets has proven to be a major hassle for plenty of app developers. CoinBase developers have done everything in their power to optimize the company\u2019s Android tablet application, which is available for download in the Google Play Store. iOS Users will receive a tablet update in the near future as well.

In turn, this has angered quite a large number of users and it has also made some question the integrity of Bitcoin wallets and whether they are still trustworthy. According to recent reports, it seems like Coinbase has asked a large number of people to submit their full name and date of birth, but also address in an effort to verify their identity and check the legality of the transaction. This practice has made many users wonder what the details are needed for and whether other Bitcoin wallet providers will start doing the same thing in the near future. Is a Bitcoin transaction really anonymous anymore in the case that the Bitcoin wallet knows who the owner of a certain address is? By imposing such a restriction, chances are that Coinbase is trying to respect all of the shady laws that can be connected with Bitcoin, which have been approved in the last couple of weeks. However, this process is also expected to have a great impact on the customer pool of the wallet provider as many will probably walk out and start looking for Bitcoin storing services other than the one offered by Coinbase. Their decision to ask people for personal information can also be considered a threat by those who are just starting out with Bitcoin now. Economic analysts who have been asked for their opinion have stated that, even if Coinbase decides to impose this restriction to Bitcoin addresses that seem suspicious, the company will still lose quite a large percentage of their users. However, it is also important to keep an eye on the fact that the company has had some issues in the past where purchases have been reversed. There\u2019s also the well-known issue of users not being allowed to make transactions with providers that are considered \u2018shady\u2019 by the company. While Coinbase remains one of the greatest wallet providers at this moment in time, it is important for them to acknowledge that not granting users the anonymity they desire and not allowing them to send payments to whomever they please will contribute to the demise of the service. In the case that Coinbase will fall, other wallet providers will probably rise, but the fact that one of the biggest online wallet companies has decided to ask certain users for their private information makes us wonder whether other wallet providers will do the same thing, thus destroying the anonymity that Bitcoin strives to provide. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, what do you think about Coinbase asking users for private information? Is this ethical in the Bitcoin market? Should users have bigger demands from online wallets and be forced to work hard to avoid any impediments like these in the future?

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/cloud-mining-company-gethashing-crowdfunds-us100k-coinprism/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Cloud Mining Company GetHashing Crowdfunds US$100k on Coinprism", "content": "Over the past few months, nearly all digital currency cloud mining services have been taking huge hits due to the declining Bitcoin price. With a lower Bitcoin value comes a greater, ifn ot impossible struggle for cloud mining operators to remain profitable, and a new course of action has to be decided upon relatively quickly. However, it is not all doom and gloom in the cloud mining world, as GetHashing raised US$100k in one week by selling colored coins through Coinprism. The idea of a crowdfunding campaign for a cloud mining company so that they can buy additional mining hardware sounds a bit strange at first, but once you give it some thought, you will start to see the logic behind that idea. Such a crowdfunding campaign would serve two purposes : the company has additional funds to buy more hardware, and the crowdfunding \u2018backers\u2019 receive something in return. In this case, every backer received colored coins called \u201cGHX\u201d, each of which is backed by a \u201ctangible\u201d asset in the form of 10 GH/s. While 10GH/s is next to nothing when comparing it to the overall Bitcoin network hashrate [which sits at 325 PH/s \u2013 or 325,000,000 GH/s] , backers of the GetHashing campaign receive something in return. What may strike people as odd is the price tag of US$4.20 put on each GHX colored coin during this campaign. Other Bitcoin cloud mining services such as Zeushash (US$3.65 for 10GH/s) and Genesis Mining (US$4.9 per 10 GH/s) have vastly different rates, depending on whether or not there are any additional fees involved [Genesis Mining does not charge maintenance fees, yet Zeushash does]. Similar to ZeusHash, GetHashing also charges a daily maintenance fee for their cloud hashing service, equal to US$0.0014 per GH/s per day. Said fees will be deducted from your daily earnings. All of the revenue generated from the additional hardware will be paid out to GHX coin holders, visible on the blockchain on a daily basis. But that is not all, as Gethashing added another incentive for backing this campaign. Investors who hold 115.5 GHX coins or more are eligible to receive a mining unit in the form of a Bitmain Antminer S5. Do keep in mind that your miner will be hosted by Gethashing during the first 90 days, and secured hosting plus maintenance fees need to be paid in advance for this 90-day period. The original plan was for Gethashing to sell 25,000 GHX colored coins [in their first batch] and raise US$100,000 in funding to buy the additional mining hardware. That goal has been reached quite easily, and it didn\u2019t take a full week to do so, which is rather impressive in its own right. All purchased GHX colored coins can be exchanged freely on the Bitcoin blockchain. GetHashing\u2019s crowdfunding campaign was made possible by using Coinprism\u2019s \u201cvirtual vending machine\u201d. This \u201cvirtual vending machine\u201d makes crowdfunding really easy, for both investors and companies alike. Investors had to send their Bitcoin to a specific generated wallet address, and once they did, the right amount of GHX coins was issued to that person automatically \u2013 depending on the incoming Bitcoin amount of course. Unlike other, more traditional crowdfunding platforms [either related to digital currency or otherwise] only minimal fees had to be paid for participating in the Gethashing crowdfunding campaign. These fees are called \u201cminer fees\u201d, and have the exact same cost as regular fees when sending a Bitcoin transaction. However, Coinprism\u2019s \u201cvirtual vending machine\u201d truly stands out because of this zero confirmation policy [which is also protected against double spend attacks]. More information about the \u201cvirtual vending machine\u201d can be found here. One other main advantage of using Coinprism for crowdfunding campaigns is the fact that their \u201csuite of offerings\u201d allows campaign owners to easily issue dividends. All mining revenue generated by this additional hardware will be distributed among people who backed the campaign, and Coinprism makes this operation far less tedious than it would be otherwise. For those crowdfunding campaign backers who wish to store and/or trade their newly acquired GHX on their mobile device, Coinprism offers a solution in that regard as well. The Coinprism mobile wallet [which is available for Android users] lets you take your Bitcoin and color coins with you wherever you go.

With this in mind, not long ago, the co-founder of the company set lofty goals, most of which he actually managed to achieve, as his Bitcoin company signed a couple of billion dollar businesses and merchants last year. To be more exact, they started off with Overstock.com and quickly moved to a couple of other companies in May such as DISH (a popular satellite TV service provider), but also other billion-dollar brands such as Dell or Expedia, all of which they still have contracts with at this moment in time. However, the last couple of months have been free of any major events, which does manage to bring in a couple of questions. Is Coinbase now fully satisfied with the number of contracts that they have signed with million and billion-dollar companies? Will they proceed to create partnerships with other companies in the near feature, as an effort to extend their influence over the Bitcoin market? Well, sources indicate that this represents exactly what will happen quite soon. At this moment, Western Union, the famous service that people from all around the world use to transfer sums of money from one country to another does not offer the ability for people to do transactions with the cryptocurrency, which has definitely saddened those who hold vast amounts of the coin and would like to send some over to a relative or friend situated in another city or country. While this remains speculation, a few rumours have been heard of Western Union discussing a plausible partnership with Coinbase, which would definitely be one of big proportions based on the large amount of pay-points that WU has set up in tons of different countries. Other Bitcoin fans speculate that service providers such as Uber could allow Bitcoin payments soon, which would definitely be understandable based on the nature of this business, which is basically an app that allows people to become taxi-drivers in exchange for a certain rate. However, there are also chances for Coinbase to carry on with the businesses that they have contracts with at this moment, and actually focus their time and resources on modifying the exchange service part of their business, which would probably need a few readjustments to ensure that more and more people will try it out and that it will actually thrive in the long run. Anyway, the truth is that a new investment or contract will probably be accepted once the coin becomes just a little bit more stable, as the last couple of days, but also weeks have been filled with fluctuations that can easily be called major for this period. Based on everything that has been outlined so far, what do you personally think about the plans that Coinbase has at this moment? It feels quite odd to think that the company has ceased the desire of signing new companies and improving their services, so what are they planning to do after all?

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/999dice-scam-exposed/", "author": "Mark", "title": "999dice \u2013 SCAM exposed", "content": "999dice is a bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin gambling website. They offer a simple dice betting game inspired by just-dice. 999dice claims to have a 0.1% house edge a whole 10 times lower than the 1% house edge of just-dice. If you are confused as to what a house edge is, it is built into the payouts. With a 1% house edge when you play the 50% game and win, you receive 1.98 times your stake as your payout. 999dice also claims to be a provably fair casino when you first visit their site: You know a site is a scam when the first sentence in their welcoming message is already a lie. In this article we will expose the elaborate 999dice scam thanks to a user by the name of keepinquiet (a throwaway account) from bitcointalk, who was able to identify the scam through simple math and an investigation of their API. The scam lies in the fact that most users do not take the time to verify that each bet on 999dice is legitimate, those who overlook the bet verification feature end up being taken advantage of by rogue betting software that tricks the user. If you want to run a successful cryptocurrency gambling site you must provide a way to the user to verify that the server has not altered their bet. The way betting sites allow users to verify their bets consists of displaying a hash which the server is using in order to generate your bet. One way that many well respected gambling sites prove their bets are fair is they displays the server hash for the day, then show the seed that generated that hash the next day. The user can all verify their bets that they made a day before by taking that seed that generated yesterday\u2019s hash + other betting info = The hash that was displayed the day before. In other words, satoshidice lets users verify ALL of their previous bets at ALL times. Other legitimate sites change the hash with every bet and also display it so that there would be no way of finding the seed for the original hash and cheat the site. 999dice\u2019s scam lies in the way that the bet verification system works. In order to verify your bet you must first click a button in order to show the server has. That\u2019s it! That is the scam, isn\u2019t it genius? Most bitcoin gamblers are not going to verify each of their bets on every cryptocurrency gambling site, so they are NOT going to click that button to show the server hash. If they never click that button they have no way of verifying that their bets are legitimate. Unlike satoshi-dice, 999dice changes their has with every bet so you must click the show server hash button in order to see the new hash. keepinquiet could not have said it better: The scam\u2019s ingenuity comes with the fact that every person trying to validate their bets will be successful at doing so, the site preys on the noobs who do not take the time to verify their bets and now those that are not going to do research about a gambling site running a suspiciously low 0.1% house edge. In addition to a simple button hiding the server hash, those who decide to use the 999dice API will quickly find out that the API \u201cencourages\u201d users to not verify their bets. The API refuses to tell you the hash unless you intentionally ask for it before betting, slowing down your bets by nearly half. Satoshidice\u2019s API requires users to submit the hash as a parameter of the function that creates the bet, Satoshidice gives the user no option but to verify the bet each and every time. Unlike 999dice they do not penalize the user for verifying each bet by slowing down the speed of each bet. In other words: The user that exposed the scam was able to come up with a way to reduce risk while increasing reward with his bets. While testing those bets on a truly random platform (random.org) the numbers all added up and the algorithm seemed to be worth playing. However, after running making over 8 million bets adding up to 92,000 BTC in total bets (thereabouts), he was NEVER up more than 20 BTC, and then only briefly at the beginning, and then it was loss after loss after loss. Keepinquiet then decided to force 999dice to verify each bet, that allowed him to win back 61 BTC in a span of 14 hours. Shortly after changing his betting algorithm the user received the following message from the 999dice admin: Stay away from 999dice like the plague. You ARE going to loose your bitcoins. If you are on a luck streak their defrauding algorithm will try to trick you into betting a huge amount and then hit you with loss after loss. There are much better alternatives if you are looking to gamble your coins, satoshidice and just-dice are just one of the few examples.

It is based on the Omni (Mastercoin) platform. Social networking and blockchain technology have been moving closer with recent technological developments the latest one being GEMS \u2013 a bitcoin based social messaging app and a cryptocurrency. At the beginning of December we reported how GEMS raised $110,000 in funding for its application, as of January 30th GEMS has raised $780,000 on the development of it\u2019s application. The massive amount of funding shows that Social Media and Cryptography generate a desirable business model. Synereo comes as the biggest integrator of both cryptocurrencies and Social networking so far. Unlike GEMS, Synereo is looking at developing a decentralized social network. Why is it so important that the social network is decentralized? In current social networks you, the end user, is the product that is being sold by the company. These corporations contain databases with your interests, hobbies, age, sex, etc on their networks. The combined patterns resulting from that information are insanely valuable to advertisers and for corporations to improve their tactics. As the Synereo team says: Now think about a new business model for social networks. Instead of the companies getting value out of the end users, why not reward the users themselves for providing those human patters and behaviors to the network. Synereo prides itself in being a simple, functional and community based project allowing the users to change the course of development and influence future decisions. The token attached to the service has also allowed the company to give a unique feature to consumers who may already be attached to a whole host of other social networking sites. The AMP tokens have been developed as a integral part of the platform allowing users to incorporate trading and economic capabilities whilst socializing. Allowing users to participate in the Attention economy Synereo aims to give the tokens an inherent value as on the platform the tokens can be used to make certain messages receive more attention from users. It also aims to allow the users to take back control of their own data and content as the tokens allow for users to be paid for content, in AMP form of course. The AMP tokens have also been hailed as the tool of choice for advertisers on the Synereo network who can buy and sell ad spaces with the cryptocurrency. The Synereo network has claimed that it will be the most secure and fastest it can possibly be with full attention and funding devoted to the development of the platform and the attached cryptocurrency. Whilst major players in the Social network game may consist of Facebook, Twitter and VK, Synereo hopes to deliver something new, but at the same time reliable. With many of the major players being accused of letting the NSA spy on their users and the messages they send Synereo comes as the alternative, praising itself on being secure and private. As with any developing project the possibility for growth is limitless. With the developers hard at work improving and tweaking the network and making sure the Amp tokens live up to their hype. There has also been a crowd-sale scheduled for next month as the initial funding round for the company. Allowing users to have their first taste of the cryptocurrency, Synereo hope this to be the first step in their long journey. Users can also have their first taste of the token by registering for the site or picking up a traditional bug Bounty paid in AMP tokens of course.

The announcement below was made by Yahoo Japan, as it reported on the scale and damage of the loss. With Hong Kong a Bitcoin country, a loss of one of the major exchanges has led to devestation spreading through out the rest of the Bitcoin markets. With alarm bells ringing across the country customers are furios as over 3000 Bitcoins were lost. The quote above simply describes how the exchange a named MyCoin was subject to the disaster as 46 Billion yen were stolen/lost on the exchange. A amount this big caused shockwaves throughout the entire Bitcoin infrastructure as the Bitcoin prices around the world reacted to the devastating news. Prices dropped around $4 from $227 to $223 which is the current price. Causes There have been many fingers pointed with the blame game being played as the culprits of the loss are being hunted. down. Some suspect a insider was the cause of the loss, as it is suspected the security systems of the exchange were breach from the inside leading to a loss of this scale. While thefts and security from outside sources can do damage to a exchange, recent attacks have been proven useless with the recent attack on Bitstamp only netting a amount under 100 Bitcoins, around 30x less than the scale of MyCoin loss. We attempted to reach out to the exchange in question but no reply was sent. At the moment the situation is shrouded in a layer of darkness as your guess is as good as mine as to where 46 Billion yen have disappeared. Speculation What will these news bring for the future of Bitcoin in Hong Kong ? Whilst it may not completelty halt the trade of cryptocurrencies in the financial hub of the world, this event has put a irrepairable dent on the reputation of Bitcoin. Whilst China may be considered out of the Bitcoin game Hong Kong remains one of Bitcoins greenest pastures with new money streaming in at a constant pace. However with the closure of what was one of Hong Kong\u2019s biggest exchanges the price may inevitably be impacted and sentiment may also decrease regarding Bitcoin. One question does remain, what would have caused this sort of loss. Whilst theft and fraud also seem possible the current case echoes the crash of MtGox. Once the biggest exchange handling Bitcoin the fraud caused not only the closure of the exchange but also sent Bitcoin into the downward spiral we are currently in. With the effects felt till this day the crash is known as one of the worst ever events to hit Bitcoin.

With PB mining already out and even CEX.IO anouncing their temporary leave, the future of Bitcoin looks uncertain. Now it comes as a a shocking announcement (but not for some who may have anticipated this sort of behavious from Josh Garza), that the Zenminer Cloud Mining services have shut down. The service shut down abruptly leaving customers with now mining power and nothing to show for their money. The company gave no announcement of any shut down and many customers remain cluesless as to why the service would have shut down with Bitcoin prices still above $200. With the mining operations currently profitable for the miners, due to many products which offered a always profitable guarantee, it has been acknowledged the mining operations may have been unsustainable on the companies part. The announcement below was released on the Hash Talk forums and outlined the current situation for GAW. Whilst GAW\u2019s repuation may already have taken a beating from the previous PayCoin fiasco, the shutting down of Zenminer comes as a massive blow with Zenminer one of the biggest mining corporations compared to the likes of CEX.IO. However Zenminer comes as the latest provider to close its doors to the public and this has caused huge confusion among customers who were surpirsed the company was able to survive whilst price hit critical points of $150. Whilst some claim ponzi and others shout scam there is only one way to discover what really happens behind those closed doors. The new wave of companies closing down has hed a drastic impact on the health of the Bitcoin network on the whole. Whilst the hash rate is dropping, and shockingly the difficulty which hasnt decreased this dramatically for years, the price has been the focus. With a dropping price the inadvertent effect is a dropping hashrate with miners no longer able to pay for operational costs. To conclude the declining prices of Bitcoin may have played a pivotal role in forcing the service to close its door but with the reputation of Josh Garza at stake (but already tarnished), many point the fingers to him. Having a reputation of going back on promises such as setting a $20 floor for the PayCoin it seems as this may have been inevitable. With the Garza empire slowly crumbling many customers may take the case to court. With Coinbase already on the verge of being taken to court over market manipulation claims, Josh may not be roaming the streets of Bitcoin for too long.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/whered-vertcoin-go/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Where did Vertcoin go?", "content": "Vertcoin was one of the few emerging peer to peer digital currencies. It was rising faster than Bitcoin, and many said it could surpass Bitcoin in value. At one point, the Vertcoin went from $0.73 each to $6.19 each, a high percentage increase that was impressive even for people used to cryptocurrencies volatility. This was part of Vertcoin\u2019s history, tearing up the charts with over 300% price increases, and many people had high expectations for this Anti-ASIC currency. However, as things happened Vertcoin lost value and in the end Bitcoin remained on top. The reason Vertcoin lost value is because the supply outweighed the demand. While the demand stayed the same if not decreased, the supply was coming in from all the miners mining the back then profitable Scrypt-N algorithm. Merchant adoption was not doing so well with Vertcoin and eventually, the selling pressure from all the miners caused Vertcoin to go down from $6.19 to currently 0.99 USD. For anyone that purchased Vertcoins back in the day, that is one hell of a loss. After such a long and hard crash many investors do not feel safe investing in Vertcoin as there is no upward momentum. It does not take a seasoned day trader to know that investing in something that is going to depreciate 400% and not rebound is a bad idea. All these factors are what caused Vertcoin to fail as a digital currency. Also, Vertcoin has lost much of its value because other coins were getting all of the attention and stealing the spotlight away from Vertcoin. You may think there are enough investors for alt coins but that is simply not true, the liquidity is constantly declining, and if investors are constantly falling prey to scams and pumps and dumps, no new players join and existing players simply give up. There is something to learn from the downfall of Vertcoin and that is that all currencies have a high point and a low point. You need to know if your investment is going to fall or is going to move on up or stay stable. Figure out facts that would cause a currency to remain calm. For example, Bitcoin recently had a record amount of transactions and large companies like Google and Facebook are thinking of using Bitcoin to pay people and accept payments in Bitcoin as well. Furthermore, The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is working on forming the worl\u2019d first BitLicense, which would enforce regulation on large bitcoin companies and help bring bitcoin to the mainstream. Mass adoption, combined with regulation equals stability. Constant market manipulation followed by scams is the reason for huge price swings and crashes in altcoins. Most people believed that Vertcoin\u2019s value increase was due to hype and wouldn\u2019t last, that school of thought scared away many investors. Most of the Vertcoin investors ended up being speculative traders which looked for short term profit. Vertcoin is not the only victim to day traders, many new coins suffer major dumps after so called \u201cinvestors\u201d mine the newly launched cryptocurrency while the difficulty is low and once the coin comes onto the exchanges they dump their bags on to the \u201cinvestors\u201d who think they are buying the coin at a good price while in reality they are the sheep. Take time to research before any investment so you know you are going to be able to have a decent chance of making a profit, or at the very worse, break even.

Initially the PayCoin article provoked some backlash from PayCoin supporters and even Josh Garza. As you can see from the original Reddit post, it is believed that PayCoin supporters were behind the recent Domain hijack and blog downtime. With the article calling out PayCoin as a scam being the source of trouble for the blog, many pointed fingers to retaliation efforts from the PayCoin supporters. Whilst many other blogs have also commented on the current PayCoin issue including BTCFeed itself, it seems CoinFire was one of the first sites to spread the news. This may have made the site a ideal target for hackers to send a message to the public who may be slandering the coin. It has also come to our attention that the Twitter Page for Coinfire has also become comprimised. As seen by the final tweets made by the account including; \u201cTake over the domain\u2026. take over the twitter. Fuck you coin fire.\u201d. The Coinfire network has been compromised and as seen below now that the hackers have gained control over the social branches held by the company more havok may be yet to come. Speculators have already begun spreading prophecies of further attacks on blogs and news sites that slack off the PayCoin. The Twitter page for Coinfire is currently down but a chached copy is available for viewing at Archive.today. The comment below was made on the original Reddit thread started to announce the downtime, it explored some of the possible meanings behind the final Tweets made by the hijacked account. To conclude the Coinfire service has gone down but as hoped by the team the downtime should be temporary. Whilst PayCoin supporters may have resources to extend the downtime of the site and gold the domain indefinitely it is hoped the public and the Domain registrar will be able to intervene and reclaim the domain name back. BTCFeed aims to carry on its service to the community and the site is currently safe. As with any attack we at BTCFeed hope Coinfire can recover and carry on providing the essential services it has been providing.

It uses POS to mine blocks which means it is more environmentally friendly because there is no need for huge mining farms endlessly hashing and wasting electricity. Navajocoin features a state of the art anonymous system featuring subchains and a decentralized network with anonymizing nodes. There are different implementations of an anon transaction technologies between different cryptocurrencies. The first and the most basic one is a centralized coin mixer. A perfect example is bitmixer.io or bitcoinfog on the tor network. They are single coin mixers which need to be trusted in order to mix your coins. You have to trust that the coin mixer is not going to scam you and take your coins. You also need to trust that the coin mixers is in fact does not store any data regarding the trasactions you are trying to mix/tumble. A better solution to establishing anonymous transactions is Darkcoin\u2019s Darksend, where obfuscation is achieved by using network nodes in order to break up and reroute the flow of money in a way that is hard to track down. Further obfuscation takes place by using similarly sized pools of money which makes it difficult to pin-down identical amounts to a certain transaction especially when multiple transactions are occurring simultaneously, all with the same amount of money. Multiple rounds of mixing are employed so that tracking payments becomes exceedingly difficult as the number of mixing rounds increases. With the use of subchains, Navajocoin looks to solve the problem of the ability of mathematically deanonymizing the transactions. Using subchains the transaction amount and destination is anonymized through a private and encrypted subchain. This breaks the chain of events between the sender and the receiver which makes it impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Alice sent coins to Bob. Using the NMG (Navajo Magic Gateway) between the sender and the receiver makes all communication double encrypted and scrambles the newly generated wallet addresses. For more information regarding the subchains and the anon technology refer to our previous story on Navajocoin. Unlike 99.9% of altcoins out there Navajocoin has been around for 6 months the development team has promised features and so far they have delivered. The state of the art anonymizing network solves critical problems with current implementation of anon transactions, if the Navajocoin development team can pull off the promised features there is no saying how high Navajocoin can go. With the anonymizing network now in beta testing Navajocoin shows promise as an up and coming cryptocurrency. As a disclaimer this is not a sponsored story and we do not have any invested NAV.

It offered 2 products which are the 2ndGen pre and the 3K0 which are both currently out of stock. Cloud mining is a form of investment when one pays for a virtual space in the company\u2019s mining farm. The cloud mining provider specifies a scheduled list of payouts which investors use to determine if the cloud mining contract is worth it. In case of LTCgear, it offered the best payouts out on scrypt/scrypt n/X11 cloud mining service, ROI 2 months as the title of their topic on bitcointalk.org suggests. It has come to our attention that payouts of LTCgear accounts have been delaying payouts and many investors are becoming increasingly concerned. Looking far back as far as December 22 of last year payouts have already started having problems and now it seems that the site\u2019s administrator Chris, is delaying payouts on a day by day basis. Here is a screenshot of an archived announcement that happened on December 30th shortly after people started having withdrawal issues: Seems that Chris claims an issue with the database caused customer\u2019s payouts to get mixed up and thus delayed. However, if we look back at an archived announcement on December 28th, 2 days prior to the database error announcement we see a different claim at hand: This time Chris claimed that there was a high load on the server and the site needed to go under maintenance. It does seem strange that such a high server load exists on a cloud mining service with scheduled payouts. Shouldn\u2019t the high load occur only during the payout times? Today on January 25th, more than a month later, many investors are still having trouble with their payouts and the current announcement on LTCgear states the following: Very reassuring, an announcement that an announcement will be posted, call it announcementception While Chris is working on drafing another announcement, the invesotrs are getting anxious and many are resorting to selling their accounts for cheap because of a loss of hope. You can find many offerings for LTCgear accounts for cheap on bitcointalk.org. Some gamblers either have hope that LTCgear will eventually honor their payout schedule and complete they pending payouts, while others might snatch up an account or 2 in case of a class action law suit if the company collapses. Recently we reported how cex.io \u2013 a once popular cloud mining company \u2013 had to shut it\u2019s doors and go out of business. Furthermore, much controversy surrounds GAWminers, yet another cloud mining company which stopped payouts and is reportedly under an SEC investigation. If you are a cryptocurrency enthusiast looking to make a quick buck, cloudmining is not the way to go. At the end of the day the problem with cloud mining companies is the business model, it is simply unsustainable. Because of the unsustainable model many fall victim to greed and become ponzi schemes, while others shut down with honor. So far we have seen delayed payouts with no explanation from the owner. It seems that the outcome of the SEC investigation on GAWminers will set the precedence for the government\u2019s involvement in the cryptocurrency cloud mining business.

This may not have been the news interpreted by many from the announcement, as many believed something big may have been in the works ready to propel Bitcoin to the moon. Don\u2019t let the price drops fool you, the Coinbase announcement still came as a surprising development and a breath of fresh air for Bitcoin adoption. With a new regulated and insured exchange on the horizon, Bitcoins fortunes may change for the better. However the prices have certainly not ! Bitcoin prices raised anticipating a big announcement with many bag holders expanding their reserves. With ammunition ready and prices rising to over $300 many believed the Coinbase announcement would be the event needed to propel the Bitcoin prices. However all came crashing and burning as prices shorted to $260 in a matter of hours. On the other hand the Winklevil announcement may bring positivity back into bitcoin allowing for a sustainable and healthy bubble to occur. As seen above the Winklevoss twins may be the key to a good year but the new Coinbase exchange is not to be underestimated. Fresh money and liquidity is to flow into the exchange and many hope the force will drive the Bitcoin prices up as currently the $260 level is being held down hard. Current Bitcoin prices are dipping as highs of over $300 which were seen yesterday are currently unavailable. Prices dropped right after the Coinbase announcement was revealed with many speculators attribution the short Bitcoin rally to the announcement which had stated Bitcoin was going to the moon. With current Bitcoin prices stabilising at the $260 mark many anticipate the prices to go up according to the Elliot wave theory. The prices have also been hinted to rise shortly according to the microtrends story documented by BTCFeed earlier in the week. Many believe the new drive and liquidity available to the Bitcoin infrastructure may give it what it needs to raise its market cap and ultimately its inherent value. Predictions are set at $300 which are anticipated by the end of the week with many analysts applying strong buy labels for the cryptocoin. Below are the prices seen by Bitcoin today. A clear drop can be noticed in value but signs of recovery are present as the $250 floor seemed to deflect various threats. To conclude this year may see a stagnating price but with extreme developments scheduled by major players in the Bitcoin game a bubble may be seen. BitPay, Coinbase and the Winklevoss twins may turn the tide in Bitcoins favour. As many of you may feel, it is the right time for a Bitcoin price rise, not only has the stagnating and dropping price led to a decline in faith on the Bitcoiners part, the prices have let down many but the early adopters of Bitcoin.

CLAM is a Proof of Stake (PoS) coin, meaning that no mining is necessary for the creation of new coins. Every minute or so, the CLAM network selects a random, unencrypted, running CLAM client and gives it one CLAM. The probability that you will be given a CLAM is based on your staking weight. Staking weight is calculated by taking the amount of CLAM you have rounded down to the nearest whole number. You cannot stake with anything less than 1 CLAM, therefore. Just-Dice.com, a famous, old Bitcoin gambling site run by the trusty BitcoinTalk.org user \u201cdooglus\u201d reopened in December, accepting CLAM deposits, bets, and withdrawals. This spiked the amount of CLAM usage and has helped ensure the success of the coin. To claim your free CLAMs, type /dig <BTC/DOGE/LTC Address> <PRIVKEY>. It is safe \u2013 you\u2019re not trusting anyone other than one of the most trusted Bitcoin users in the world. If you do not trust Dooglus to handle your private keys, you can claim your CLAMs locally on your own machine. To do this, you need to download the wallet and sync it. After doing this, select File > Import Wallet and select your wallet.db for BTC, DOGE, or LTC. The CLAM client will rescan the blockchain and after just a few short minutes you should see your free CLAMs; about 4.6 per address! CLAM was fully distributed at its launch in May and there was no premine, so rest assured it is no pump-and-dump altcoin. CLAM by its very foundations as staying power and managed to dominate the markets for some time. CLAM faucets available now are: http://xdeathwing.com/faucetv2 and http://myfreeclams.com Each of these faucets pay out small amounts of CLAM every few hours, so be sure to check them regularly. If you wish to gamble with your newly \u201cdug\u201d CLAM, Just-Dice.com and FortuneJack.com both are popular and trusted gambling websites that accept CLAM deposits, bets, and withdrawals. They have both been known to pay out on-time and reliably and Just-Dice can be argued to be the first or second most trusted gambling site affiliated with the Bitcoin community, the other site being Primedice, but that\u2019s another story. Just-Dice offers a feature where you can invest your CLAM in their site. In fact, you can have up to 100x your on-site investment off-site, meaning you only need to put less than 1% of your investment on Just-Dice itself. This is a bit complicated, so I suggest you read Just-Dice\u2019s FAQ before delving into off-site investments. The on-site investment feature, though, is very simple. You can invest and divest at will with no costs or fees. You earn 90% of net profit and take the losses. With a house edge of 1%, profit is guaranteed for Just-Dice especially since they stake over 50% of all the blocks. Your CLAMs will only grow at Just-Dice, but consider investing off-site. This helps stabilise the CLAM distribution problem. You see, Just-Dice holds over 70% of all CLAM. This means that they stake an enormous amount of CLAMs and so they get richer and everyone else gets poorer. Off-site investments mean that YOU can stake and Just-Dice\u2019s held-CLAM-amount decreases drastically. Make sure to claim your CLAMs!

The agency that is responsible for monitoring every citizen in every state, have become much more intrusive on their campaign for dominance over digital communications. Recently, President Obama has also become outspoken on his views against cryptography in recent times. He also gave his approval to Cameroon hoping to allow the government to have more power and be able to access the data of people on a legal basis. NSA have been extremely busy in the field of spying and cracking as it has been discovered they have found a way to bypass the HTTPS protocol to snoop and spy on private data. The HTTPS, one form of a secure communications protocol meant to keep data encrypted has already been rendered useless by the agency. It may only be a matter of months till the agency manages to crack the cryptography behind digital currencies such as Bitcoin. The NSA have also become interested in Cryptocurrency due to their potential to terrorists and other criminals. Whilst Obama may house the common stereotype that cryptology is only useful if you have something to hide. This stereotype is largely false due to the majority of people using crypto, simply enjoy the financial freedom and security provided by the code. With Cameroon being given support by America to be more intrusive on communications being routed in and around the country, it is thought cryptocurrencies will also be regulated to allow the government to monitor transactions. Monitoring transactions made with crypto may be detrimental to the health of the markets since the majority of transactions will essentially be traceable and tracked at will by the government, The idea of a cryptocurrency was meant to be a replacement for the current government controlled centralized cryptocurrencies and if the government of Cameroon does violate users privacy, the health of crypto may be damaged irreparably around the country. To conclude it may be only a matter of time till the cryptology holding Bitcoin together gives way to the prying eyes of the government. However this will have to wait as the development in cryptography is currently much faster than the attempts to break it by the NSA and other respective agencies.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/josh-garzas-speech-cancelled-tnabc/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Josh Garza\u2019s speech cancelled at TNABC", "content": "Josh Garza is the man behind the latest controversial altcoin \u2013 Paycoin. He was scheduled for a speech at the bitcoin conference in miami on Saturday @ 2PM. However, something changed his mind because it seems like that time slot is now occupied by Harry Yeh from MD Binary Financial, which is an Investment management company focused on providing superior returns for its clients and partners in the digital asset space. Take a look at this email sent my Moe Levin, the event organizer: A further look at this hashtalk thread reveals that Garza will hold a Q&A session: A couple weeks ago we alerted users to think twice about attending the upcoming bitcoin conference in miami. We argued that PayBase did not belong in the conference as a premier sponsor because it has completely no relation to bitcoin. It supports a competing cryptocurrency which is led by an individual with a questionable reputation. However, with the recent news that Garza\u2019s keynote speech is cancelled you can rest assured that no potential investors are going to be subjects of Garza\u2019s preaching. It seems that for one reason or another Josh Garza does not want to do a Q&A session in the open hall where most of the bitcoin conference participants will be. Instead, he wants an isolated room which will be devoted solely for his session. That is not an unreasonable request because after all PayBase \u2013 Garza\u2019s company, is a premier sponsor for the bitcoin conference. One theory as to why Mr. Garza wants to hold a Q&A session in a separate room is because the people who will bother to attend the session are going to be mostly Paycoin supporters, since most of the attendees at the conference are bitcoin enthusiasts and do not have much interest in alternative cryptocurrencies. Thus, any skeptics would be frowned upon by the devoted followers. In fact, it looks like the Q&A sessions is going to proceed very similarly to the way hashtalk.org operates. The forum is heavily moderated and any negative comments regarding Paycoin or their operations get instantly removed. A brief look at the XPY chart on bittrex shows us that Paycoin currently trades @ 0.019 BTC the equivalent of roughly $3.8 Paycoin still has a long way to go. In order to at the very least establish legitimacy it must go back to the promised $20 floor. Otherwise plenty of investors are going to be left betrayed and feel like they were scammed.

In a short blog post all was revealed as the PayCoin boss Josh Garza unveiled the PayCoin Honour Program. The Honour program consisted of many new updates to the Paycoin network such as the coins will be held in a vault operated by a independent company. As juicy and interesting as this may sound all eyes were lower down as the Honor program revealed that the long awaited $20 floor for the coin. Recent times are tough for PayCoin investors with the price dropping at ever bound. However with Josh Garza supposedly keeping to his word fortunes may change for those who invested. However one cannot breathe a sigh of relief at the first sign of a positive as Josh Garza has failed to keep up to many of his promises in the past. In our previous article we had explored the unsustainability of the PayCoin with many users flagging up the coin as a scam for a variety of reasons. The $20 floor promised was also a reason for investors to worry as many other industrial player and analysts predicted this would be unsustainable and unprofitable for the site. However with the site promising to take action on some promises, shown below, investors will soon discover the authenticity of GAW. There were also various other feature outlined in the Honour Programme which will soon be going ahead. These included Account Verification, Third-Party Authentication, Monthly Repurchase Disbursements which is a new feature for the PayCoin. More details can be read on the PayBase Blog Since the release of the news the price of PayCoin briefly spiked to 0.023 Bitcoins. This higher price was not held for long as the positivity of the news died down and prices slid back down to lows of 0.013 Bitcoins in a matter of hours. The PayCoin is speculated to have a upward market movement if the Honour Program does ever get started as the $20 floor will get the ball rolling for growth. Current investors are set to multiply their PayCoin value 5x + but only time will tell if the infamous Josh Garza lives up to his latest promise.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/coinbase-security-compromises-overview/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Coinbase security and compromises \u2013 an overview", "content": "There are many online wallets available for Bitcoin but the leaders in the online wallet sector are undoubtedly, Blockchain.info and coinbase. Both of these companies have received a huge chunk of investments which have provided them the best possible base to reach out to many users. In fact, blockchain.info has a staggering 2,766,318 users making it the worlds most popular bitcoin wallet. Though it doesn\u2019t have an option to buy and sell bitcoins, it is the most poplar wallet. Coinbase, on the other hand, is not far away with 2.1 consumer million wallets as stated by their website. It also has a feature wherein the user can buy an sell bitcoins, depending on his geographical location which is limited to the United States and 18 other European countries. Have you ever wondered about how does coinbase secure its funds? Well, they have top notch security and interesting, systematic ways to make their funds secure. In today\u2019s post, we will be covering the security at coinbase, recent hacks and some implementations to keep you secure. Coinbase is one of the leading bitcoin exchanges and wallet services headed by Brian Armstrong, also the co-founder of the company. The company offers its bitcoin buying and selling services in 19 countries and charges a fee of 1%. It also offers merchant services, and it offers zero fees for the first $1 million transacted and from then on, it charges a 1% fee to convert the bitcoins into fiat currency. They also have a variety of apps which use the coinbase API. According to this post on coinbase\u2019s official blog, coinbase shed some light on the fact that they have an insurance from Aon, one of the worlds leading insurance brokers. It is interesting to note that they didn\u2019t disclose it when they obtained the insurance which was in 2013. This insurance might as well be the showstopper due to which more and more people start embracing coinbase. The insurance covers various aspects for bitcoin loss, such as loss of bitcoins due to security bugs, attacks, employee theft etc. But it is important to note that that they wont be refunding bitcoins lost due to negligence of a user, or the users login credentials being compromised. There have been many reports in which few users wallets were hacked. The verge published a post here stating that a coinbase user, Jeff lost 10.6 Bitcoins which were refunded. But he experienced the same issue again and this time, he found out that a new order of $7000 worth of bitcoins had been made and been cleared. He responded to this by taking strong measures to move the funds to a safe offline wallet, but he lost the money refunded earlier when he was first hacked. Similar hacks were reported by two other users who lost $15000 and $6000 respectively. The first user was refunded as the hack was not caused by his negligence while the other user was not refunded his money because he hadn\u2019t enabled proper security measures such as two-factor authentication. Regarding the storage of the funds, they store up to 97% of their funds stored in various vaults and deposit boxes spread all over the world. One more engaging feature is that they also distribute paper backups along with the funds. They also have an intriguing feature, the vault, which was released during early july, 2014. It has additional security for outgoing funds such as multi signature technology, delayed withdrawals though which you can delay a withdrawal if anyone initiates it within a specific time frame. This was implemented to facilitate large scale institutions and people who want to store a lot of bitcoins. Though there have been no reports of vaults getting hacked, it is yet to be seen how this feature turns out to be because its just been 6 months since its release. I gave it a shot ans setup a simple vault, with two approvers. It is important to note that we still have no information regarding the security of vaults, hence we will not go into the depths of this. The vault has a delayed withdrawal time of 48 hours which cannot be removed even in times of emergency, and the transaction needs to be approved by a set of people which you need to select while making the vault., and notifications will be sent to your phone and emails. To know more about this, please visit the vault FAQ Moving on, the company is very keen on protecting their consumers passwords, and to ensure that they have a good experience, and hence, they leave no stone unturned by encrypting the wallets, private keys and data with AES-256 standard. Coinbase only hires employees who have passed a criminal background check to prevent insider thefts. After being employed, it is mandatory for them to have their hard drives and other storage drives encrypted and they must also use screen locking to prevent unwanted access to their workstations. They also have security audits by expert outsiders in addition to the Coinbase bug bounty program, which rewards security researches handsomely(minimum $1000) if they find vulnerabilities in the coinbase ecosystem. Lastly, The passwords of user accounts located in the database are hashed and stored. Overall, coinbase seems to be a secure wallet provided that the user implements strong security measures such as two factor authentication, a keyword scrambler on their workstation and most importantly use the vault for storing large amounts(otherwise, dont store large volumes of funds) etc. They do give out refunds but if there is a error from the users side, they won\u2019t be refunding. Hence we strongly recommend you to instead, use something much safer for storing funds such as cold storage, paper wallet or a hardware wallet where you can live care free. Otherwise, the buy/sell feature is very easy for everyone, right from the newbie to the pro. Moreover, you need to make sure that you disable your API key if you aren\u2019t using it because it was due to the API key that many hackers have been able to steal bitcoins from users coinbase wallet. If you already have granted access to any apps, you can revoke it from here. It is highly recommended to also make sure the emails you get from coinbase are secure because if your email gets hacked, you may have to face dire consequences.

A recent tragedy has befallen on the Bitcoin world. There\u2019s chaos and grief all over Bitcoin forums in this post-Bitstamp downfall era. Although the implications of this event may not be as disastrous as the fall of Mt. Gox, but it has certainly caused the trust to be plummeted on centralized Bitcoin exchanges \u2013 now more than ever. In contrast, there\u2019s only one exchange that has been quietly sitting in the backseat and watching the events unfold right in front of them. Sometimes called as \u201cthe shadiest exchange of them all\u201d on Reddit, BTC-e is the only Bitcoin exchange that can proudly claim to have been through all, ever since late 2011, to have survived this wild west without a major attack on their trading platform. \u201cOne man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s freedom fighter\u201c The above statement has not only become a cliche, but also one of the profound sayings which expresses the concept of objective and subjective reality in a very efficient manner. Although, generally the aphorism is used to describe the perplexing nature of terrorism, it can also be applied to observe any school of thought. In this case, try to think of BTC-e in a neutral position. BTC-e has been a subject of controversy since their platform went live. They have been criticized based on no evidence to be involved with money laundering and all other forms of online criminal activity. Notwithstanding the false rumors, the only sound reason for such criticism is because they have chosen to remain anonymous. Once again, providing no evidence, a reddit user on Bitcoin comments about BTC-e: \u201cYou would have to be crazy to be using it. No accountability whatsoever, no names, and past stolen coins seems to flow there, so they promote theft clearly. If they cooperated with authorities and released their server logs so IP\u2019s and accounts could be traced I\u2019d trust them a little more. But its\u2019 quite obvious, this is a criminal type site. It\u2019s not hard to imagine they promote fraud, evasion, etc.\u201d The origins and whereabouts of BTC-e and its founders still remains a mystery to the general public. In fact, it seems like that the management team behind BTC-e is adhering to the philosophy of anonymity on purpose. There is little to no information available on their website about the company\u2019s physical location. The terms of use on BTC\u2013e\u2019s website states the exchange is governed by the laws applicable in Cyprus. However, a Google search on them reveals that they are based in Bulgaria. This keeps adding up. They usually don\u2019t do interviews and have maintained their distance from the overall Bitcoin community. Moving on, there\u2019s no company blog and good luck finding a contact number to directly reach them.In our interconnected and supposedly free world, this may come across as practices of a \u2018shady\u2019 business to a bystander. And fairly so. Because, after all, they are involved in the money business. If their customers are trusting them with their money, this reason alone should be compelling enough for them to remain transparent and publicly identify themselves. Following this logical argument, one could draw a conclusion from the consequences of the premises. The premise of the argument here being that they must remain publicly accountable because they are dealing with customers finances. Since they are secretive about their operations, hence, they must be involved in something illegal. Thus, reaching to a conclusion, from a subjective point view and labeling them as terrorist according to \u201cOne man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s freedom fighter.\u201c Given the exception of BTC-e, there\u2019s no easy way of acquiring Bitcoins from an exchange without handing over your personal documents to a strange company over the Internet. Let it be noted that it won\u2019t only be criminals who are cautious about revealing their identities. The alarming raids on the invasion of privacy have caused stress among ordinary law abiding citizens. Amid the staggering rise in online identity theft, people have woken up and become more privacy-centric and vigilant of their online activities. There is no doubt that this was the reason Satasohi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin in the first place. If BTC-e have kept themselves as anonymous, it is in accordance with the founding principles of Bitcoin, i.e. to give power back in the hands of honest people. To this date, BTC-e has never been accused of stealing people\u2019s money or engaging in any sort of malicious behavior by several users of the exchange. Following this logical argument, let\u2019s draw a conclusion from the consequences of the premises. The premise of the argument here being that Bitcoin users need a more efficient way of buying & selling Bitcoins without disclosing their personal information to third parties. Since they have a reputation in this business which speaks for itself and because there haven\u2019t been negative customer feedback, hence, they are fulfilling the purpose of a truly free exchange. Thus, reaching to a conclusion, from an objective point of view and labeling them as freedom fighter according to \u201cOne man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s freedom fighter.\u201d The freedom fighter with the likes of Satoshi Nakamoto. Conclusion I\u2019d like to point out that readers have been advised in the beginning of the article to approach with a neutral stance on the topic. The whole purpose of this post was to highlight the difference of opinion surrounding this controversial exchange. Investors are highly advised to do their own due diligence before putting their hard earned money into an exchange like BTC-e.", "date": "2015-01-12T23:37:52+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 1, "day": 12}

This comes as shocking news as Bitpay becomes one of the first major Bitcoin companies to lay off employees. It is thought that the recent spate of spending may have led to a shortage of funds. The recent multi million dollar sponsorship deal that Bitpay signed with the St Petersburg Bowl is thought to be a long running commitment running till the end of next year. However the company has let slip that this was not the true reason behind the layoffs as they put it down to a simple surplus in labor and workers. The quote below displays the reasons behind the recent layoffs. But as far as layoffs go, these are the only to be had for the start of the year. As a few jobs disappear more are created as the team behind the Ripple digital cryptocurrency announce their new lineup of jobs. With the support and engineering departments of the company looking for fresh talent the company has also introduced a handful of jobs for other Legal and even internships. Ripple labs have been on a recruiting drive looking for talented and unique people willing to offer more to a already growing enterprise. Working in a cryptocoin based environment has become a new reality for some as the growing market has allowed for the employment of thousands of individuals around the world. Once thought of a plaything crypto has cemented its position among other real life industries. Below was the short statement released on the Ripple labs website which describes how life in the world of crypto is comparable to a real job with the competition, compassion and drive for success at the same level. To conclude the Bitcoin markets are growing sustainably branching outwards and upwards. The fact employees have started to be laid off from Bitcoin companies does leave a thought as this is still a majorly unheard of event, especially coming from Bitpay one of the biggest and most successful Bitcoin companies.

However as with any mining operation profits are essential to the growth and welfare of the business. As seen above, the blog post released by the company, the company has struggled to maintain profits and are not able to pay for maintenance whilst sustaining withdraws. The trading platform hosted by the company has remained online due to it relying simply on trades for profit. Taking certain percentages out of every trade has become a much more profitable method than mining. With the foreseeable future pushing more and more miners out of the game it will only be soon enough that only the biggest survive. However all is not lost for those who purchased ghs from the cloud mining provider as the company released the comment below stating customers can enable their mining power manually if they want to. It was also stated that the company may decide to resume full time mining operations soon should mining become profitable once again. It may not be apparent to many of the big players in the mining industry but to many small mining farms and home miners the recent spikes in difficulty and crash in price have contributed to many miners being squeezed out of the mining game. Whereas previously (2010) you could generate 50 Bitcoins from the comfort of your own home using nothing more than a GPU, difficulty has risen constantly over the past years making mining at home almost obsolete. To conclude the mining game is pushing even the biggest of competitors out and seeing Cex.io pushed out has left many wondering, when will their time be up.

The decentralized payment network of Bitcoin allows instant transfer of value without an involvement of a third party taking fees in between. It\u2019s only logical to extend the inexpensive financial protocol into providing alternative solutions for online monetizing strategies.In the future, where new business models will erupt to provide an alternative source of revenue for content producers, the existing payment channels might be ill-suited, due to their high fees structure. Aside from excessive fees, the current payments legacy serves as a huge barrier for those content producers in the developing world who don\u2019t have proper banking facilities in their own countries.During 2014, we saw a rise in popularity for ChangeTip. Essentially, a Bitcoin tipping platform integrated into social media, it allows content creators on social media outlets to receive small amount of money from strangers on the internet. There was also Sfx.io, a music publishing website focused on to bring the benefits of micropayments to the musicians from around the world.Now, there\u2019s another start up from Argentina who is following a similar decentralized model and integrating bitcoin micropayment channel into a peer to peer video streaming service called \u2018Streamium \u2013 A Decentralized Pay-As-You-Go Streaming Service.\u2019 How does it work? Their platform will allow anyone to broadcast video and get paid by viewers in real time without a middlemen. The person who wants to host the content can go on their website to set up a stream along with their Bitcoin address. After providing a USD/min rate, the stream\u2019s URL can be shared by the content provider to as many clients as they like.The viewer of the stream can commit any amount of Bitcoin as they wish. This will determine and put a limit on the maximum amount of time the stream can be viewed by a client. The deployment of a micropayment channel on the back end of this service allows content provider to receive Bitcoins as the viewer watches the stream. Once the stream is over, the micropayment channel is closed and the transaction is then broadcasted to the Bitcoin network. Open Source Following the open-source model of Bitcoin, the team at Streamium published their first repository on GitHub. Streamium is currently in beta phase and according to the developing team, a lot of the details have yet to be ironed out. ConclusionGary Fung, founder of the online torrent files repository isoHunt, explains how the phenomenon of micropayments will provide a new revenue model for video streaming services and artists alike:\u201cNew streaming services could find a hybrid approach by using BitTorrent P2P streaming to lower cost and Bitcoin for pay per view micro-transactions.

As Bitstamp announces the recommence of their services, confidence and trust in the exchange is likely to be retained by their customers.

Since the birth of the Ponzi scheme in Russia, which left a sinkhole of around a few million for many institutions which had been invested including banks, the Ponzi has thrived on the greed instilled in most people. However Ponzi schemes have become a particular nuisance to the health of the bitcoin community as when dealing with bitcoin many fail to realise that they are actually dealing with currency and the possibility of throwing $100 in bitcoin into a ponzi is much higher than throwing a crisp $100 bill in one. Recent times have given rise to Ponzi schemes as the number of investment opportunities arising from the current market panic that work by using \u201csecret methods\u201d or are part of a \u201chighly specialized trading\u201d group promising returns is surprising. In recent weeks the rise of two prominent ponzis side by side has shocked and provoked many. Weekly Ponzi and CryptoDouble have become two extremely successfull ponzis with the latter on the verge of collapsing. With over 100\u2019s of Bitcoins invested these two Ponzis have shown just of desperate some of the current Bitcoin community may have become due to the market movement.", "date": "2015-01-10T22:19:30+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 1, "day": 10}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/altcoins-dying-make-one-hour/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Why altcoins are dying and how to make one in under an hour", "content": "When we refer to altcoins we mean alternative cryptocurrencies. Most of these altcoins (99%), utilize the blockchain and are a mere fork of the bitcoin code in one form or another. You do not need to be an expert programmer in order to launch an altcoin to dominate cryptoland. In this article we will briefly show you how to make your own altcoin in under an hour Step 1: find a coin you like that you would like to clone and base your altcoin on, in this case we will clone the recently talked about cryptocurrency: Paycoin If you didn\u2019t know Paycoin is a clone of Peercoin so we could also fork the Peercoin code and we will achieve the same result. Step 2: Navigate to Paycoin\u2019s github and clone the repo. git clone https://github.com/GAWMiners/paycoin Step 3: Choose a name for your coin, we will use PaycoinDark Step 4: Find and Replace. Now you will use a program like fnr (find and replace) and find all instances of Paycoin in the code and replace it with PaycoinDark. You should also search for XPC and replaces that with a symbol of your choice, in our case we will use XPCD. Step 5: Customize it! Navigate to main.h in the src folder and start changing the values for the variables. Here is some relevant code from main.h: static const int64 MIN_TX_FEE = 0.1 * CENT; static const int64 MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE = 0.1 * CENT; static const int64 MAX_MONEY = 2000000000 * COIN; static const int64 MAX_MINT_PROOF_OF_WORK = 9999 * COIN; static const int64 MIN_TXOUT_AMOUNT = MIN_TX_FEE; static const int STAKE_TARGET_SPACING = 1 * 60; // 1-minute block static const int STAKE_MIN_AGE = 60 * 60; // minimum age for coin age static const int STAKE_MAX_AGE = 60 * 60 * 24 * 5; // stake age of full weight static const int STAKE_START_TIME = 1418470264; // Sat 13 Dec 2014 06:31:04 AM EST static const unsigned int POW_START_TIME = 1418403600; // Fri 12 Dec 2014 12:00:00 PM EST static const unsigned int POW_END_TIME = 1419181200; // Sun 21 Dec 2014 12:00:00 PM EST static const unsigned int MODIFIER_INTERVAL = 10 * 60; static const int64 NUMBER_OF_PRIMENODE = 50; static const int64 MINIMUM_FOR_ORION = 50 * COIN; static const int64 MINIMUM_FOR_PRIMENODE = 125000 * COIN; You can modify the MAX_MONEY variable to choose the max amount of coins, modify the stake age requirement and the stake %, modify the length of a block (30 seconds, 1 minute, 10 minutes), and modify the reward per blog for which the code is found in main.cpp. This article is not going to go into every single detail in creating a coin but will give a general overview of the process. Step 6: Create a new genesis block. After modifying the code for the altcoin you must reset the code in order to generate the genesis block which is the first block in the chain. In order to do so you must set a few variables, the merkle hash, the genesis block, and the nOnce. Once set it will look something like this: static const uint256 hashGenesisBlockOfficial(\"0x0\"); block.nNonce = 0; assert(block.hashMerkleRoot == uint256(\"0x0\")); Once you reset the chain in the source code you will need to compile the code and run the coin daemon. At the initial start it will crash but will generate a new hash for the genesis block, which will be the nOnce. In other words, it will create a unique hash which will mark the beginning of a new blockchain programatically attached to your new altcoin. That\u2019s it, once you have your genesis block you would need to put it\u2019s hash in the hashGenesisBlockOfficial variable, recompile, and your altcoin is ready to be mined! Remember that you need atleast 2 nodes running the same blockchain in order for the mining process to happen. A single entity cannot mine the cryptocurrency in its current state. As you can see, you do not need to be an expert programmer in order to launch your own cryptocurrency. Yes you do need some system administration skills and basic understanding of C++ but in no way do you need to write new code from scratch. The reason altcoins are dying is because more and more people are finding out how easy it is to create a new coin and try to profit from it. That results in a plethora of altcoins, there are dozens of coins coming out daily on bitcointalk.org. Furthermore, altcoinland is dominated by get rich quick scams, pumps and dumps, lies and deception. As more people get scammed by investing in a scamcoin the liquidity of the cryptocurrency market decreases as traders are left with an empty wallet. When liquidity decreases so do the prices and marketcaps. Lets look at a comparison of altcoin marketcaps back in 2014 compared to altcoin market caps today, courtesy of coinmarketcap: Here we can see that 2014 has been a sad year for altcoins, since all the market caps have declined a considerable amount. More importantly we can see clear evidence that altcoins live a short lifespan, out of the top 10 altcoins only 3 kept their position at the top, the rest got replaced with newly hyped coins, Peercoin being the only exception. Thus, we conclude that investments in altcoins are very high risk, with a decreasing reward. With the start of 2015 and the drama with GawMiners and Paycoin, this year does not look good for any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. Over 70% of people still do not know what bitcoin is. While some altcoins might offer improved features, better anonymity, a cleaner code, Bitcoin\u2019s network is so robust and is on it\u2019s way to mass adoption. If after 5 years over 70% of people are still not familiar with Bitcoin imagine how hard it would be to persuade someone to use an altcoin and explain to him the numerous improvements it has over Bitcoin. Society is just not ready for altcoins yet. Us crypto enthusiasts might see a clear advantage of a certain coin over Bitcoin but most of the time that coin will not be used in any way other than trading. In addition, once the hype dies with a new feature, or a new coin, it is left to die in an ocean of altcoin chains. In 2014, Bitcoin\u2019s marketcap was at around 12 billion, right behind it stood Ripples with a 2.7 billion marketcap. That means that in 2014 Bitcoin was worth around 5 times more than Ripples. Fast forward to 2015 and we can see that now Bitcoin\u2019s market cap has decreased to 3.9 billion and Ripples to 0.6 billion. That means that now Bitcoin is worth 6 times more than Ripple. In other words, even though the overall marketcap for bitcoin and altcoins has decreased. Meaning that relatively to altcoins, Bitcoin is still doing better in 2015 than it did in 2014.

Although there hasn\u2019t been a formal announcement by OkCoin about this feature, a look at their international website confirms this new development. What is a trail order? A stop order that can be set at a defined percentage away from a security\u2019s current market price. If a trader takes a long position, a trailing stop would be set below the current average market price. On the other hand, if a trader takes a short position, a trailing stop would be set above the current price. By allowing the trader to set the defined percentage, trailing stop enable the trade to remain open and profitable for as long as the market is moving in the right direction. A trailing stop can also be set in quote currency which would be CNY on OkCoin trading platform.The Big Deal Traders are always looking for new ways to make profit. They are also looking for traditional tools available in other major financial markets in order to remain liquid. An exchange which claims to be the largest digital currencies exchange in the biggest Bitcoin market must bridge the gap between Bitcoin and institutional trading. Trailing stop orders are a common standard in the stock market because of the flexibility they offer to the trader. Rather than manually resetting in a fixed stop loss, a trailing stop order automatically tracks the movement in price before closing a position. This is yet another step towards attracting institutional money into the Bitcoin ecosystem. CriticismDuring the year 2013, 80% of Bitcoin trading volume took place on Mt. Gox. Ever since the downfall of Mt. Gox in Feb 2014, several Chinese exchanges sprouted to take over the lead in market share. Thanks to the Chinese, Bitcoin is now slowly ushering into the era of high frequency trading. Despite the heavy criticism around this practice, majority of Chinese exchanges are aware about and actively participating in it. Their zero fee trading model have caught the attention of market makers from around the world. But, this is not viewed in positive light by the Bitcoin community. In a AMA by OkCoin on Reddit, they admitted to be involved in HFT:\u201cIt all boils down to the zero-fee trading model. Because we don\u2019t charge our users any fees for trades there is a lot of HFT(High Frequency Trading) taking place.

From the initial stages of heavy criticism by the Bitcoin community to regulators giving a second thought to innovation, it has been quite a ride. For now, as we enter the first quarter of 2015, it seems that the day of final BitLicense proposal is getting closer.In a recent interview with Charlie Herman, the host of WNYC\u2019s Money Talking, NYDFS Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky talks about his plans to issue the final rules for a Bitlicense. After announcing the latest revisions to the draft BitLicense two weeks ago on Dec 19 in Washington, DC, the next step here is that they will release the full text of the revision in the coming days. Following the release, there will be another thirty day comment period for the public. Only then we\u2019d see a final version of Bitlicense. An ETA for this would be somewhere late Q1 2015, according to Ben Lawsky.Lawksy points out that this is how New York regulatory process works and there\u2019s no way to avoid this. Due to the influence of New York as being the financial center of the world, they want to make sure they create solid and consistent regulations without stifling innovation. When asked by the interviewer if the NYDFS is afraid of getting this wrong, he responded that they have given a lot of thought into this and adamantly discards the possibility of a failure. Somewhere during the end of the radio interview, Ben Lawksy talks about a call he received from a major regulator in Washington and how the state regulators there are looking at digital currencies from a different angle. He further dwells on the topic by pointing out the regulatory landscape on a national scale within United States. Despite the importance of New York as the financial hub, Ben Lawsky believes the technology of Bitcoin requires different regulations for different societies. In a very likely scenario of widespread adoption, New York would like to serve as an example, he adds.

In the world of scandals, an old saying goes, \u201cThere is no such thing as bad publicity.\u201d These last three days had an avalanche of bad press for PayCoin \u2013 the altcoin backed by Josh Garza/GAW miners. But, in the Bitcoin world, negative publicity means a loss of 70% in value within 72 hours. Whilst the management of PayCoin have associated the plunge in price with an \u201cinternal security issue\u201c, several Bitcoin users have unequivocally called it a ponzi scheme. This event has brought the integrity of these independent news sources under public scrutiny.But even before its IPO which took place on the 17th of Dec, Josh Garza purchased a cryptocurrency news publication and refuses to publicly state the name of the acquired press outlet. Several Bitcoin enthusiasts on Reddit demanded a public statement of every news blog to publicly declare their association with Josh and openly deny their ownership from him. Many representatives from several publications responded to this allegation. Here\u2019s an example: History is often known to repeat itself. In any scandal, there are three types of players surrounding it. The ones who try to expose it, the ones who try to conceal it and then ones that choose a diplomatic approach and stay silent. Admittedly, PayCoin is an alt-coin at the end of the day, and the news encompassing it should not gain attention of Bitcoin\u2013centric publications. Fair enough. An article published by NewsBTC calls out every PayCoin hater to be a \u2018crypto-extremist\u2018. This is a very bold move to take given the current animosity towards Josh Garza. However, this should not be surprising looking at their website.CCN (CryptoCoinsNews) recently did a full blown interview of Josh Garza on their website. This article was published at the time when the market was still in a \u2018pump\u2019. One certainly can not fool the market. The steep decline in the price of PayCoin serves as evidence to his statement. Once again, judging by the sponsored ads spanning the background of CCN, it come as no surprise why they don\u2019t highlight PayCoin in a negative light. The Bitcoin community in general has never been more united for a common cause. To some it may serve as an impending doom ever since the downfall of MTGox earlier in 2014. In contrast, some believe the whole GAW miners and PayCoin fiasco has nothing to do with Bitcoin and it should be dealt separately as an alt-coin. The debacle may seem to be getting out of control, but it speaks a lot about the self-policing nature of the Bitcoin community, which serves to protect it against bad players.

As you already know, the top US exchange Bitstamp have suspended their services as of January 5th 2015. The cause appears to be compromised operation wallets which, according to bitstamp, have been compromised on January 4th. As of now, we are not sure how the wallets were compromised or what the vulnerability was. However, we speculate that a high fee attack might be the method used. A r/Bitcoin user by the name of ShindlersCat pointed out that he received 2 transaction each of 0.01 BTC to his bitstamp account roughly 6 hours before the announcement. Lets take a closer look at each transaction, here is a screenshot of the first transaciton: As you can see there is a very generous 0.1 BTC fee in the transaction, this fee goes to a random miner which happens to verify that transaction. Another look at the second transaction reveals the same 0.1 BTC miner\u2019s fee. Upon further investigation, thanks to the r/Bitcoin user basil00 a similar transaction was found which contained an even more generous 10 BTC fee! Now, assuming that the funds were sent from Bitstamp\u2019s operational wallets, setting high fees would mean btc loss to random miners, quite a sticky situation isn\u2019t it?

The ISG3D team has also provided us with some more clarification in regards to their sale of the ISG 11 in exchange for Bitcoin. Bitcoin payments will not be subject to any additional taxes, meaning you will pay exactly US$899 for the ISG11. Furthermore, when orders over US$100 in value are eligible for free shipping, which also includes shipping for the 3D printer itself. A lot of people have never bought a 3D printer before, and now that you can purchase one with Bitcoin, there are a lot of interested parties, which also bring a few interesting questions to the table. For example, considering this is a brand new model being produced by a relatively unknown company, people are wondering how hard it will be in order to print something properly. The ISG3D has assured us that, after users have done the necessary calibrating, the installation itself is pretty straightforward when you considering the ISG 11 3D printer will be shipped fully assembled already.

One of the first coins ever developed in the histry of crypto, the coin has amassed huge popularity among followers. Not to mention the great market activity surrounding the coin which has lead to stability and steady growth benefiting many of its users. On an short interview with the DarkCoin lead dev, Evan Duffield i gained a in depth insight into the dedicated development team behind the coin and what the future holds in store for it. Evan Duffield : Darkcoin started out with the mission of creating a type of eCash for the internet. During this year we\u2019ve worked on a strategy to accomplish this by adding two innovations. The first is masternodes, a infrastructure innovation which allows us to build functional services into the core protocol. Utilizing the first, we\u2019re able to add functional innovations such as privacy and instant transactions. By introducing Masternodes, we solve many of the issues that Bitcoin faces, such as the bleeding of full nodes and lack of network infrastructure. For example, Darkcoin with a mere market cap of 9 million (as of this morning) has 1700 masternodes running currently. Bitcoin with a market cap of 4 billion, only has 6600 due to a lack of incentive for full node operators. With more full nodes comes much greater ability for these operators to serve users creating a great user experience during for propagating of messages, syncing and the ability for the network to withstand denial of service attacks. During the 2014 year we\u2019ve managed to create the core technology backing the masternode network and also implement Darksend, our flagship anonymization technology. Users who want to anonymize coins can do so at any time, using any number of the masternodes to anonymize their coins in a completely trustless way. Evan Duffield : Now that the Darkcoin core technology is stable and working, we\u2019ll be unveiling our 2015 marketing plan soon. This will involve a highly organized group of people reaching out to Bitcoin businesses and users all over the world to tell them about how Darkcoin can benefit them. We\u2019re gearing up to position ourselves as a business friendly private cryptocurrency. Beyond that we also have some exciting partnerships in the works and we\u2019ll be receiving more information about soon. Evan Duffield : Our team is growing all of the time, so we\u2019re able to move really fast and implement many new features on top of the Bitcoin core technology. Currently we have six developers, which is more than enough to build all of the required technology in-house. This will allow us to continue to lead the crypto-currency privacy revolution and provide other crypto-currencies with our technology to improve the whole ecosystem. Evan Duffield : For early 2015 we have some exciting features in the works such as forking from the Bitcoin 0.9.3 codebase to gain years of code improvements, the Darksend precision matching engine for much faster mixing, instantX which provides instant irreversible transactions*, encrypted masternode communications to ensure no one is snooping on connections, the multipath routing system for hiding masternode IPs and 2-factor authentication at a core protocol level to protect user funds. Darkcoin is moving faster than ever so we look forward to the progress in 2015! *Bitcoin transactions can be reversed by mining a conflicting transaction after an unconfirmed transaction has been broadcast. Utilizing this attack, an attacker would mine a conflicting transaction in a block, once they have a block they would purchase goods. After the transaction has been broadcast to the whole network and been instantly confirmed \u201csafe\u201d and goods have been delivered, they would broadcast the conflicting block and then receive the funds back. InstantX solves this by using a concensus and locking strategy described here: https://www.darkcoin.io/downloads/InstantTX.pdf So there it was an exclusive interview with the DarkCoin team.

Public policies are a great tool to counter some of these confusions and to raise awareness at the same time. Fortunately, a new institution called Coin Centre is focusing on the public policy issues currently hindering the growth of Blockchain technologies. In a recent announcement, along with the launch of their website, Jerry Burito explains what CoinCenter is all about and what they plan to do in the future. The executive director of Coin Center writes on his website: \u201cCoin Center is an educational and research institution focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency technologies. Think of us as a think tank for blockchain technology. Our mission is to build a better understanding of the technology in order to promote a regulatory climate that preserves maximum freedom of action for digital currency innovation.\u201d Research and Education While the amount of Venture Capital investment in Bitcoin start ups is a major highlight in Bitcoin\u2019s infrastructure, we should not forget that there has to be money and time invested in the education of this young technology. By keeping education as their core principle, Coin Center has gathered a team of individuals who are working full-time on this project. They currently have people with an expertise in public policy, education, research and technology. The year 2014 taught the growing pains of a maturing technology to the Bitcoin community. It also showed a dire need of regulation in the industry. People at Coin Center realize the importance of cooperating with the regulators for the long term success of Bitcoin. But, they also understand the prerequisites of innovation in this novel technology. So, in order to make sure that the innovators and regulators have an equal footing in the future, Coin Center will be engaging policymakers, media and public at large. \u201cSuccess for us is a world in which regulators, the media, and the public understand what cryptocurrency technologies are (and aren\u2019t) and why they\u2019re important. A world in which technologists can continue to enjoy the freedom to tinker. A world in which entrepreneurs can confidently make the promise of cryptocurrency a reality for consumers. Yet one of the greatest potential impediments to that world is over burdensome regulation.\u201d Future Plans With several events lined up for the upcoming year, CoinCenter is ready to educate the world about the promises and challenges of cryptocurrencies technologies. Their research director Peter Van Valkenburgh will be presenting on cryptocurrency and regulation at an emerging technology event for EU parliamentarians. Conclusion A great addition to the Bitcoin ecosystem, we need something like CoinCenter in every country where Bitcoin has the potential to reach mainstream success. That\u2019s the real beauty of education. Most Bitcoin enthusiasts believe Bitcoin to be too complicated for an average user. But what we really need is a way to clear the misconceptions around Bitcoin. If every country had a think tank dedicated to the block chain technology, most of the misconceptions about Bitcoin would not have been in the first place.", "date": "2015-01-06T21:20:22+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 1, "day": 6}

The ongoing situation regarding the Bitstamp exchange has been a widely documented event. Occurring less than a week ago, the exploit has seen over 19k coins being stolen from compromised wallets belonging to Bitstamp. With users currently seeing their deposits stuck or essentially frozen and not being credited to their accounts, the situation reached a point where the entire service being pulled from the web till a fix can be put into place. More on the hack and further details can be found on our previous article. Well the Reddit community has paid particular attention to the movement of the stolen coins. So far it has been confirmed the 19k haul has been moved from the primary address which was used by the hacker to store over $5million. Further down the line it has been brought to our attention the Bitcoins are once again on the move to various other address displayed in the image below. The image provided by Reddit user \u201cCreationlayer\u201d, displays how the coins have been moved from address to address in an attempt to obfuscate the origins of the coins. The movement of many of the coins has been associated to a certain IP adress from Sweden. Investigations into the address perpetrating the transfers revealed most were broadcasted from the country. However this IP may not reveal the exact location of the attacker as the IP may simply be the first IP that saw the transaction. The IP may also be a simple mixing service put to use by the hacker but the significance of it has been highlighted by the fact it is implicated with several of the transactions involving stolen Bitcoins. With the coins being located many customers who had their deposits redirected to the address can now keep track of the movements occurring with their Bitcoin. The nature of the Bitcoin network and the fact transactions are irreversible has put a dent into many users hopes of receiving their Bitcoins back. However the exchange has released a statement that many of the coins are insured with the vast majority of the users remaining safe as coins will be in cold storage or be reimbursed. Many believe the recent Bitstamp attack may have been perpetrated by insiders. In the wake of last market manipulation attempt by the bots operating on the MtGox exchange, many fear that the same may be in the works. With some describing the exchange as a Gox, only time will tell what the reopening of the exchange will bring. With a trail run held for around 24 hours the exchange was taken offline again with promises of it coming online within 24-48 hours given. In other news possibilities of the coin being stolen by Adam Guerbuez have also risen.

There are the ones who are actually skilled to commit a high level fraud and then there are those low life spammers who target on the gullibility of their victims to execute their little scam. Bitcoin, due to its untraceable nature like cash have attained the curiosity of outlaws from all around. Several Bitcoin users on Reddit have reported to receive a phishing email from CoinBase which was intended to steal login credentials of the online bitcoin wallet.Here\u2019s a screenshot of the email with a fake email address associated with CoinBase. Here\u2019s an image of outbound link with a highlighted address bar:Who Falls For This?So, here\u2019s my question. Who is gullible enough not to notice these apparent red flags? Sure, one could argue that there are people in the world who aren\u2019t very cautious by nature. Or maybe, someone could be under the influence of alcohol on an occasion and may fall for this trap. For instance, like this reddit user:\u201cI fell for it\u2026Hung over from NYE. Oh well\u20262-form authentication. And now resetting my passwords.\u201dAn Industry StandardAnyone who have been using email technology is certainly aware of these \u2018junk\u2019 emails. After a while, it doesn\u2019t take much to detect an obvious phishing attack. A redditor states:\u201cI have never ever seen a phishing email that didn\u2019t have at least a couple spelling errors, grammar mistakes, or punctuation flukes. Is crafting a 50 word email in perfect English really that hard? It\u2019s as if they aren\u2019t even trying.\u201dThe obvious grammatical mistakes and spelling errors in the email is a common practice among these phishing attempts. There is enough evidence in the content of the email to believe that this piece of work is not carried out by someone who is very articulate in English. Over recent years, Nigerian scams have gotten a lot of public scrutiny and there have been many attempts to educate the majority of Internet users to verify the address bar of their browser before entering any personal information.A Community Driven EffortBitcoin users are generally more tech-savvy than majority of the Internet users. This becomes conspicuous when there\u2019s a community driven effort to minimize such phishing attacks gaining any fruition. Within few hours after the email, active Bitcoin users on reddit took actions to report this hoax website to Google as spam which resulted in the page being taken down. Bitcoin\u2019s advocates have been promoting the idea of storing Bitcoins on an offline wallet ever since the beginning. Because the technology allows anyone to be their own bank, it\u2019s recommended not to store large amounts of Bitcoin on third party websites like CoinBase. To this date, there have been massive successful phishing scams using BlockChain.info wallets as a cover. It seems like CoinBase might be the next likely target.", "date": "2015-01-02T11:29:15+00:00", "year": 2015, "month": 1, "day": 2}
