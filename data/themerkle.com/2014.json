While the price aspect of Bitcoin is the only measurement of its success for some people, a simple analysis of Google search trends says a lot more about an overall interest in Bitcoin among the masses. As it turns out, a new study of Google trends show a sudden rise of Bitcoin related searches during the holiday season. In the above picture, Google Trend highlight a rise of Google searches for Bitcoin up to 300% in USA and 140% worldwide. The time frame chosen for this analysis is seven days from 20th of Dec to 27th of December, 2014. This unforeseen surge interest in Bitcoin during the last week could be due to a myriad of reasons. One could argue that the recent success of Bitcoin Bowl event organized by BitPay may have led to more people finding about Bitcoin. Looking further here\u2019s a result of related searches. The first Bitcoin Bowl event took place in St. Petesburg, FL and the data provided by Google Trends further proves the claim that this surge may have been due to it. Although, BitPay\u2019s target market for their business model were merchants, they also aired two commercials on ESPN to reach a wider audience by introducing them to Bitcoin for overall exposure.Another possible conclusion of this surge of interest in Bitcoin was explained by a redditor:\u201cIt\u2019s because of all the news articles saying that bitcoin was the worst investment of 2014 as far as value (from 750 to 320 Jan 1 2014 to present day). I read a lot of financial news, it made headlines as the media\u2019s \u2018Year in Review\u2019 2014 recap.\u201dSo, what does it say about long term potential of Bitcoin and the overall interest in it as shown by Google Trends? Well, historically, the movements of Bitcoin\u2019s price has correlated with Google search volume. In fact, this may have been the first time that a trend had gone awry. It becomes more apparent if we try to analyze for shorter time frames. Here\u2019s a chart that looks at Google search volume and price historical data for Bitcoin.Now looking at the image above, it becomes apparent that for the outsiders, Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility is the single most important factor for them. More importantly, during the time of highest price movements and usually at the peak of a bubble.It should be noted that the rise in volume of searches during a bowl game or at the peak of a bubble is no reason for pessimism. In fact, it is human nature. We all are entrapped in the digital age and the flow of information has no barriers. This has led to a shorter attention of span among masses. Today, even the most hardcore Bitcoin believers admit to be unaware of the underlying technology behind Bitcoin at some point and the potential it carries for our future. By being fascinated with its dollar pegged value, they couldn\u2019t see the bigger picture. Over time, the people who choose to learn about the underpinnings of Bitcoin were the ones who were greatly rewarded with profits.", "date": "2014-12-30T11:42:43+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 12, "day": 30}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-programming/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Bitcoin Programming", "content": "As Bitcoin is gaining more and more attention in the media, whether positive or negative, plenty of developers and enthusiasts are starting to take a liking to the technology involved. Imagine you are a(n aspiring) coder, and you want to get involved with Bitcoin coding, where do you even start? It is a question on a lot of people\u2019s minds, but there is no single definitive answer. What we can do, is give you some pointers in the right direction. Javascript Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world, and Bitcoin is no exception to that fact. Especially when you consider BitPay, the world\u2019s leading Bitcoin payment processor, has developed their own JS library which you can use on the server and client (in the form of Bitcore.io). Furthermore, aspiring developers can start building their application with a web interface on top of it, and do all of this in one and the same programming language. More importantly, Javascript will help developers in distributing to every platform in existence, as Javascript is a universal programming language. Most projects on GitHub are all written in Javascript, and the most famous project is Node.JS, a skill sought after by many Bitcoin companies looking to hire additional coders. Bitcoinj and Bitcore are two other examples which were created using Javascript. Ruby Ruby is a very interesting programming language, as it is not on the curriculum in most countries when you are trying to get a degree in computer science and programming. Ruby will come in handy when you shift your focus to developing web applications for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Make sure to check out the Ruby on Rails framework if you decide to take this route! Python Python is one of those programming languages which is easier to pick up than most. Not just because Python has a very friendly syntax, but it also offers an array of data analyzing tools. I have personally dabbled around a bit with Python a few years ago, and I have to say, this is one fun programming language for novice coders. C/C++ Both C and C++ are the most obvious choice for experienced coders in order to start developing Bitcoin-related applications and services. However, for people who just want to get their toes wet in the world of programming, neither of these languages are great choices, simply because they can, and most likely will be quite overwhelming. If you are an experienced programmer and are proficient in C/C++ then a great path to choose to start developing Bitcoin applications checkout the book Mastering Bitcoin. for more info and a free online version of the book visit this repository: https://github.com/aantonop/bitcoinbook Conclusion There are plenty of programming languages to choose from when it comes to developing Bitcoin applications and services. A lot of your success in this area will depend on how passionate you are about creating something, and if you like the programming language you are using. Also, remember that each programming language has its strengths and weaknesses which means that certain programming languages are better tailored for certain applications.

Indonesia in particular has seen the rise of Bitcoin with a handful of startups out on one mission. To increase the exposure and increase adoption. With the economy of Indonesia still at a developing phase many citizens have not yet had access to banks and other financial institutions. Bitcoin was seen as a viable option for citizens with its flexibility and ease of use a plus to the users. This prompted Bitdoku to set up a exchange designed to let users purchase Bitcoin easily and securely. With the majority of Indonesian citizens owning smartphones the service was optimized for use with them. Hopes for the service were held if with demand slowly but surely raising reflecting increasing interest for the virtual currency. With a slogan of \u201cBuy Bitcoin [in] under 3 min HERE\u201d, its easy to see how BitDoku became popular and a minuscule 0.2% fee also weighed in on their benefit. The startup in Indonesia has simplified the process of buying a bitcoin. Whilst the majority of bitcoins would have been traded via exchanges, BitDoku allows people in Indoniesia to use popular services such as Whats App/SMS to purchase Bitcoin and as a majority of the population own smartphones the service gained popularity among citizens. On the other hand Bitcoin Indonesia has also led to the rise of Bitcoin in the country. The exchange dedicated to providing Indonesian customers with the access to trading services has seen daily trade volumes of over a hundred Bitcoins. The exchange has also been busy building the infrastructure needed for the country to utilize the full power of the Bitcoin. Earlier this year Indonesian merchants saw the ease and benefit of switching to Bitcoin. in a collaboration between the exchange and payment processor iPaymu , a new service was launched allowing 10000 merchants all around the country to be able to accept Bitcoin as a payment methods. Indomaret also aided in the deal as the company allowed over 200 million Indonesian citizens to purchase Bitcoin via the exchange using the local currency rupiah , and be able to use them in the stores around the country. The law is even tolerating of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as it too allows traders to use it at their own risk not outlawing it completely. Whilst explaining risks and precautions that should be made the free economy of Indonesia has given rise to the next generation of Bitcoin entrepreneurs. So there it was. The development of a new nation more tolerant and accepting of the digital currency. Indonesia has adopted the Bitcoin in all aspects of daily life with rising numbers of people embracing new technology at rapid rates. No more waiting days for bank transfers, the future has arrived and as the economy of Indonesia develops so do the citizens. Financial management has been escalated and Bitcoin has increased its grip on the world.

We witnessed a promising rally on December 26th which set a new high, however, the bears crushed it setting last week\u2019s low of $307. The current pattern seems to be mini rallies with high volatility followed by a brutal crushing. We witnessed a similar situation on December 20th where we bottomed out at $316 after a 24 hour rally of a $10 run, shown in the chart below: It seems that we are bottoming out at the $300-$310 price point as the bears fight the bulls. We do have a strong support level at $300 which is both mental and the result of the fact that we double bottomed 10 days ago which might point to a trend reversal. The top chart on tradingview currently suggests that decision time is coming soon. Meaning that, soon we will either see a complete trend reversal followed by rally causing a price adjustment, or crypto is going to crash harder than a smart car hit by an oncoming XL UPS truck full of Christmas presents. Here is the chart: The second and third most popular charts on tradingview hold a LONG position anticipating a trend reversal. The user Hen0xyd used Elliot Waves to predict a trend change coming at the beginning of 2015. Ralph Nelson Elliott , Born on July 28, 1871 examined yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly and half-hourly charts of the various indexes covering 75 years of stock market behavior. Using his wave theory he was able to predict the day that the Dow Jones\u2019 13 \u2013 a popular stock market index \u2013 month bearish correction ended. He sent out a telegram to Charles J. Collins of Investment Counsel, Inc. in Detroit the day before the trend reversal: Bitcoin has experienced a year long decline ever since the December 2013 high, could Elliot Wave Theory be able to predict the end of the bearish market? Below is a demonstration of Elliot\u2019s decision making theory. Some current trading strategies may include cashing in on those mini rallies. If you are day trading, wait for an intermediate dump which usually happens at night when traders that hedled the day before come back online and sell at a loss. Next, buy in and hodl for a couple hours during the day and sell when the dilusional noobs notice the mini rally, and start preaching that we are launching to mars. For you risky whales your perfect scenario would be to time your buy in just right before the trend reversal, just like Elliot. As a disclaimer we are not responsible for any losses caused as a result of the above opinion. Lets hope for a mega rally to carry us to the moon and beyond, for now the fate of bitcoin is hard to determine (as always). One thing is for certain, analysts agree that a decision is coming. That decision will determine if the year long trend will come to a halt and turn 180 degrees, or we crash harder setting new lows.

The war waging between the federal government and the world of crypto is not a silent one. With the federal government taking stern action against those behind the Silk Road marketplace, raiding servers and shutting down the drug marketplace once and for all, intelligence may have come from the NSA according to quite a few sources. The quote below explains how crypto algorithms may be of significant intrest to the NSA, which were put into action for one caused to gather intelligence and safeguard the security of the country. The particularly intrusive spying techniques put to use by the NSA have received backlash from the public with even the crypto community aware of their activities. The NSA have already cracked various other security protocols such as the HTTPS protocol and the algorithms and security protocols undermining digital currencies such as Bitcoin may also be next. According to leaked documents released by American whistle blower Edward Snowdon it has been proven that the NSA and the FBI both have their eyes set on the crypto world. The NSA may have their own reasons to wanting to spy on crypto users as the link between Bitcoin and terrorism was found by many. Bitcoin was pointed out by many american authorities to be the ideal funding source. The anonymity and versatility the digital currency provides is unparalleled and provides various benefits to terrorist groups. Tracking and spying on funds going to and from terrorists will essentially give the government unprecedented access into the movements of terrorists. \u201cFor surveillance experts, it becomes very difficult to trace the whereabouts of a person who visits a particular website or to attack a specific person while they are using Tor to surf the Web,\u201d the Spiegel journalists reported. So the NSA is out with a vengence out to attack the crypto community violating its users privacy and security. The NSA millions or billions in funding but Bitcoin was born on the decentralized and secure system that has pushed it to global fame.

Bitcoin has been a disruptive form of payment for a few years now, and it looks like both of these technologies are coming together, thanks to ISG3D. ISG3D is a Canadian-based 3D printing store, where you can purchase 3D printers, PLA Filaments and 3D printed parts & objects. Besides a physical presence, IGS3D also offers 3D printing services for online users, including providing a technical draw of the idea, creating a 3D model in STL format, and print out customer designs. One of the most interesting aspects of ISG3D\u2019s service is the fact they can work on 3D modeling for any kind of object, regardless of its size. Even though the maximum print size is 18 cm x 18 cm x 18 cm, customers can submit their ideas and/or drawings, along with as many details as they possibly can, to ISG3D in order to obtain a full 3D model. The reason for this article is about ISG3D working on their very own 3D printers, of which a first prototype has been created, starting out with a Pruse i3. While the \u201cISG 11\u201d is the very first model ever built by ISG3D, it looks pretty solid judging by the images we have received. The main difference between the ISG 11 and the Pruse i3 comes in the form of a different heatbed, custom built frames, and so forth. This is where 3D printing and Bitcoin come together, as ISG3D is selling the ISG 11 on their online store, and they are accepting Bitcoin as a payment option. The price for your very own 3D printer is US$773.11 excluding taxes, and US$889.07 including taxes. Do keep in mind the difference between both prices is calculated based on the tax percentage of Quebec, Canada. Note from the author : ISG3D.com is accepting bitcoin on everything in the store. When ordering your very own ISG 11, you can choose between white, black, red, green, yellow or blue as a color. As far as shipping costs go, there are no additional costs according to their website. Depending on whether you are in Canada (4 working days), the US (7-14 business days) or Europe (10-20 business days), delivery times may vary. There is also talk about an ISGPayCoin which will be ready in 2015: The ISG 11 can print objects up to 20cm x 20cm x 18cm, and has a printer volume of 42cm x 42 cm x 46 cm. The filament used for this 3D printer is 1.75 ABS/PLA filament, and one spool of black PLA filament is included in every order.

One of the most commemorative collectibles comes in the form of a physical Bitcoin coin. While there are several types of physical Bitcoins in existence, one of the most renowned names is Casascius. Casascius physical Bitcoins have been in circulation for several years now, and are always made in very limited quantities. Mike Caldwell, the person behind the Casascius coins, started in this venture in 2011, when he released the Original series 1 BTC coins. Over the years, we have seen several iterations of these items coin hit the market, produced in brass, silver, gold-plated alloy, gold-plated bars, and even a 1 oz. gold coin. What made these coins so awesome from the get go was the fact each coin came loaded with e amount of Bitcoin they represented. For example, the Original series 1 BTC coin had an actual balance of 1 Bitcoin, tied to the private key which is embedded inside the coin and protected by a tamper-evident hologram. Unfortunately, Mike Caldwell suspended sales of items containing digital Bitcoins as of November 27th,2013. All of the items for sale on his own webshop do not contain a Bitcoin balance tied to the private key. However, that doesn\u2019t make these coins less valuable in my opinion, as they are still extremely awesome collectibles. Fast forward to a few days ago, and we were presented to the only Casascius coin to be created in 2014. With a limited supply of only 2,000; of which an unknown amount will not be put up for sale; a Casascius coin commemorating the upcoming Bitcoin Bowl in St. Petersburg was created. The Casascius Bitcoin Bowl coin is a 1-ounce limited edition fine silver medallion commemorating the first professional sporting event under the banner of Bitcoin. On the front, we see the traditional Casascius\u00ae design, with the St. Petersburg Bitcoin Bowl logo to be found on the back. Several parts of the Casascius Bitcoin Bowl coin have been adorned with gold plating : the polished rim, the Bitcoin B on the front of the coin and the Bowl logo itself. All in all, this is a very beautiful looking coin which is a must)have for Bitcoin enthusiasts, regardless of whether you are a sports fan or not.

Because it\u2019s not a company with a marketing department, it remains up to the key industry players to keep creating awareness about this movement. For quite some time now, Bitcoin\u2019s proponents have been spreading the good word around within their own circles \u2013 which has limited the exposure. It has been repeatedly mentioned over different Bitcoin forums that everyday joe is yet still unaware of what Bitcoin is or what kind of benefit it has for merchants. Here enters Bitcoin St Petersburg Bowl, a strategic move by BitPay to promote Bitcoin over a college football match. BitPay entered into a partnship with ESPN events to offer new ways for the sports fan to use Bitcoin. This move is also a great opportunity to introduce Bitcoin to those who haven\u2019t even heard about it. The first Bitcoin St Petersburg Bowl or \u201cBitcoin Bowl\u201d took place yesterday and it\u2019s scheduled throughout 2016. While the response from global Bitcoin community was very positive, the real reason behind such peculiar marketing stunt was explained by BitPay\u2019s marketing manager Tony Sakich: \u201cWe want this to be people\u2019s first experience with Bitcoin,\u201d said Bitpay\u2019s marketing manager Tony Sakich. \u201cWe want to show the world how easy it is to send Bitcoins over social media.\u201dIt seems like BitPay\u2019s mission of educating the event attendees worked brilliantly. Chris Brunner, president of bitcoin brokerage Trucoin reported:\u201cIt\u2019s been exciting for us to speak to people who are from a slightly different demographic,\u201d Brunner said. \u201cAs bitcoin becomes more mainstream, it\u2019s exciting for us to touch base with the world outside with the tech-sphere.\u201dThe aftermath of the first national Bitcoin sponsored event resulted in a social media storm led by several Bitcoin players. The twitter campaign turned out to be a success just during the first quarter of the match, according to Mad Bitcoins. Hashtag #BitcoinBowl has been trending nationwide. Newcomers who are interested in learning more about the technology have been receiving small of Bitcoins through @ChangeTip \u2013 a bitcoin tipping service. Several bitcoin enthusiasts including the author Andreas Antonopoulos and bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik kept donating Bitcoins throughout the game. \u201cI still have lots of tips to give out for those who want to try bitcoin and learn about it. #bitcoinbowl\u201c Along with physical presence during the football match, BitPay also aired several advertisements showcasing the benefits of using Bitcoin for merchants. These commercials are so far the first by a Bitcoin company to be aired on ESPN, a major sports network that reaches 100 million households in total. Watch the first commercial here: This marketing move has been an overall great surprise by BitPay during the holidays\u2019s season for the general Bitcoin community.

The sweet aroma of cash may be one of the biggest pull of the rap industry. As much as fiat cash is appealing and a greenback may never match the Bitcoin in a rappers eye 50 Cent has proved that stereotypes die hard. In a recent interview with Stephen Meyers, which can be seen below, 50Cent remarked \u201cAll money is money\u201d referring to Bitcoin. This sudden remark prompted many to believe that the Rap Artist has bigger plans for the currency as after all \u2018money is money\u2019 no matter what. Following a $78 milion sponsorhip deal, the talk of bitcoin raises a few eyebrows. The rapper is currently supporting the Bitcoin by allowing users to purchase his album using the cryptocurrency. Watch the full interview below. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3qTcclcHEc Snoop Dog has also been one of the industries greatest. Being one of the first artisits to accept Bitcoin along side 50Cent, music and Bitcoin have become 2 very close entities. With the cryptocurrency already being used to purchase music tracks on independent platforms. Near the end of 2013 Snoop Dog dropped the bombshell as his reply to a Coin Base tweet set the ball rolling for Bitcoin.\u201d@coinbase dm your info. I want to make it happen.\u201d in his words. Music distribution has become predominantly an online business. With millions changing hands each day the advantages of Bitcoin are clear. One of the main reasons behind 50Cent\u2019s decision however has to do with sales. With some of 50Cent\u2019s albums not faring too well in a saturated rap market, Bitcoin opened up a whole new customer base. With music consumption going through the roof and Bitcoin use also going to the moon, the comibnation of the two can only mean one thing. More money and more business for one of the biggest rappers in the game. You may be familiar with Coinye. The coin dedicated to Kanye West didnt receive much appreciation from him. Sued to eternity and back by Kanye West the currency eventually was killed off displaying how the Rap game may not have been suited to cryptocurrency. However the recent advances made by Bitcoin suggests all industries may be accepting and tolerating of Bitcoin even creative industries. Coinye may have died but the legacy lives on with rappers such as 50Cent and Snoop Dog showing the game is changing for the better. To conclude Bitcoin and music are coming closer and closer. Whilst technology may be one of Bitcoins strongest points, the innovation in mining and security may be unmatched by any other sector, dabbing in other industries has seen only benefits for the currency. More exposure and adoption by many different companies and individuals has been one of the strongest points of the currency this year.Whilst the price may not be faring too well celebrity sponshorship may be one gamchanging event as its not everyday a coin is endorsed by an individual worth more than $100 million.

However the graphs recently show a whole different story. The market has been deemed Bullish by the majority of users. Whilst $300 has been a strong support level for Bitcoin over the past few months the coin has remained stable not rising infact decreasing on many occasions. Graph analysis brings to light how the prices have dropped over the past week in paticular. $320 seems to be the upper wall restricting growth in the markets. Resistance was particularly strong from the bullish markets at present a small increase in price was instantly reverted pushing the price to new lows of $316. This occurred twice with the second blow sending the price further to $315. The analysts never stop analysis and speculators never stop speculating but the incoming threat of a huge price drop is looming. Ask anyone where the price will go and expect to receive any one of the two answers, either to the moon or that the coin will crash and burn. These 2 perceptions have long been rooted into the Bitcoin community but the ongoing market activity has seemingly rattled most of the community. With the Buy to Sell ratio suggesting the price has a long way down. However strong hands will not have given up as looking at the bigger picture most traders are still in positives. With the worst of the storm seemingly gone will a rally ensue after this last drop ?

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/amsterdam-bitcoin-city/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Amsterdam Bitcoin City", "content": "Bitcoin popularity in The Netherlands is seeing all-time highs, as the Amsterdam Bitcoin City initiative recently signed three more retailers. Despite this initiative only starting in November of this year, no less than 24 retailers are accepting Bitcoin payments in their brick and mortar store so far. In order to get as many retailers as possible on board, a strategic partnership had to be formed between BitStraat and BitPay. For those of you who have never heard of Bitstraat, they are a Dutch bitcoin company offering retailers all the tools they need in order to accept Bitcoin payments in a professional and secure way. They also take care of converting Bitcoin transactions to fiat currency, which is then deposited into the retailer\u2019s bank account within 48 hours. And the best part is that there are no fees for the retailer at all, not for the Bitcoin payment itself, nor for the conversion from BTC to fiat currency when receiving funds in their bank account. While Bitstraat offers an amazing package in its own right, BitPay has managed to sweeten this deal even more. The first 100 retailers to become a member of Amsterdam Bitcoin City will receive a Bitcoin payment starter kit,completely free of charge. One of the most important tools in this starter kit is a custom-built Bitcoin point-of-sale terminal, which is actually a modified tablet running the Bitstraat application. Furthermore, every single one of these terminals comes with a personalized BitPay merchant account, allowing retailers to keep an eye on their transaction history and download transaction reports. On top of that, every retailer has the option to keep a certain percentage of each transaction in Bitcoin, instead of converting the full amount to fiat currency. Until the retailer handles 900 EUR or more worth of Bitcoin transactions a monthly basis, these payment terminals remain completely free of charge. Once that threshold is reached, there are two options : keep the terminal for a monthly fee of 10 EUR, or buy the terminal for a one-time fee of 120 EUR. As of right now, there are still 82 terminals available to Amsterdam retailers who want to become a part of this initiative. As I mentioned in the introduction, three new merchants have signed up to become a part of Amsterdam Bitcoin City : cooperative creative hub Open Coop, ecological builder\u2019s market Ego-Logisch and bar/restaurant Trust. Considering the Amsterdam Bitcoin City initiative has only been around for nearly two months, having 24 retailers on board is nothing short of amazing, and very good news for Bitcoin adoption in The Netherlands. However, there is still a long way to go in order to make Amsterdam the world\u2019s Bitcoin capital. Bitstraat and BitPay want to sign up at least 100 brick and mortar stores accepting Bitcoin payments, so a lot of work lies ahead. If they can keep up their current pace, it won\u2019t take that long to reach their intended goal.

The Russian Ruble known for its stability and preferred by Russian investors has lost its position as one of the best investments of 2014 as Bitcoin usurps its place. As seen on BTC-E, the trade volume for BTC-RUB has dramatically increased signalling many Russians to let their Ruble balance be dumped in favor of the cryptocurrency, Today marks one of the lowest levels seen for the Russian Ruble since the early 1998.Compared to the GreenBack the Russian Ruble tumbled and fell 11% a record low. The trading between the 2 volatile currencies continued with increase seen in volume as investors dived head first into the depths of crypto. The frenzy has triggered speculation surrounding Russia economic state as many perceive the trade sanctions imposed by the west to have severe economic impacts to the economy. The devaluation of the Ruble has launched volatility increasing which is extremely unusual for a currency to demonstrate during this stage of its maturity. The amount of wealth encased in the Russian economy is unbelievable as the country is home to one of the highest number of millionaires. With new cash being pumped into the Bitcoin economy one would expect some sort of rise. Surely pumping hundreds of thousands of Dollars into the economy might having given the price of Bitcoin a playful nudge in the right direction. In this case it gave the price a push in the wrong direction as the price of Bitcoin fell with $20 + shaved off bringing the price of Bitcoin down to $319, as of writing, and falling. The tight restrictions placed on the trade and use of Bitcoins in the country has not deterred many Bitcoin traders as the fragile Ruble has seen turbulence lengthen meaning Bitcoin is a much safer investment.

As we enter into the last weeks of December, traders and market participants anticipate in desperation for a trend reversal. So far, after making a low of $275 on Oct 5th at Bitstamp, the price movement during the last ten weeks have been on a stagnant mode. Trading in a tight range, the calls of doom and the end of Bitcoin can be heard on several Bitcoin forums around the web. What does it say about market psychology? Well, usually, this sentiment usually echoes when market is about to complete a cycle \u2013 and in this case, the longest bear market in the history of Bitcoin. Just last week, Microsoft \u2013 the tech giant announced that it has started accepting Bitcoin for its digital goods. This was great news for Bitcoin as it further legitimizes the use case for mainstream market. Following the announcement, Bitcoin price surged 7.2% from a low of $339 to $364. But, once again, the day closed at $346. Another positive news and yet no rally that everyone has been expecting. In fact, after the China ban and MT.Gox debacle during early 2014, Bitcoin has seen positive news throughout the year. There have been constant developments and capital invested in the Bitcoin ecosystem and yet the price keeps slowly declining. Well, that\u2019s because news don\u2019t move the price. It\u2019s a myth. Market makers understand this psyche better than anyone else. Instead of relying on news, educated traders look at charts. Technical analysis and tools like Elliot Wave are a mathematical way to compute the price movement in the future. So, what do these tools say about the future? Elliott Wave has but a few rules which can not be broken. One of them is that a wave four can not overlap a wave one even briefly. The high of April 2013 rally at $266 marks the completion Wave 1 and the market is currently trading in Wave 4. Due to these reasons, many predictions of Bitcoin going below $100 hold no evidence to back their claim. The end of bear markets are known to end violently. At the time of this post, 12/18, Bitcoin is trading at $322 on Bitstamp. The week opened on 12/15 at a high of $357 and saw high selling starting from Monday. One day RSI (Relative Strength Index) went from 45 to 31. The weekly MACD still remains red while weekly RSI indicates a sign of oversold. Something here is about to change. While daytraders crunch numbers and take profit from every little bounce and fall, most of Bitcoin believers hold it as a long term investment. While 2014 has been the year for Bitcoin ecosystem, many proponents believe that the price has to soon catch up. With prise rising, demand will follow. The bears have certainly ran out of steam given the low trading volume and the time for trend reversal is almost here.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/mastercard-comments-bitcoin-regulation/", "author": "danish javed", "title": "MasterCard Comments on Bitcoin and Regulation", "content": "MasterCard, the US multi-national financial services corporation has recently come out against Bitcoin. The company demands regulators to create a so-called \u201clevel playing field\u201d within the payments industry. The statement came ahead of the ongoing inquiry over digital currency\u2019s legal treatment. The inquiry was submitted by CoinJar, a Bitcoin payments systems provider to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics (Australia). Standardized Treatment MasterCard argues that all financial services should be regulated to ensure standardized provision of services to guarantee overall safety and simplicity for merchants and consumers. A few days after MasterCard\u2019s outcry against Bitcoin, Matthew Driver, President of MasterCard South East Asia, criticized digital currencies like Bitcoin. According to Matthew Driver, Bitcoin is associated with too many risks to actually succeed as an alternative payment solution and currency. General Concerns Aside from demanding a level playing field, MasterCard raised their concerns for Bitcoin\u2019s inability to provide the values necessary to provide a quality financial service, the same values MasterCard leveraged to establish the fundamental foundation for its enterprise. According to them, consumer protection, counter-terrorism financing and anti-money laundering policies should comprise the regulation affecting electronic payments. Associated Risks MasterCard in their crusade against the infant industry of digital currency demanded the application of similar standards associated with payment services. The consumer and commercial trust that currently exists is a result of decades of dedication and hard work to provide a safe, stable and reliable service, isolated from fluctuations and volatility, while maintaining a while degree of transparency. Since Bitcoin lacks the basic mechanism to provide sufficient degree of security, something which MasterCard claims to provide, Bitcoin users are exposed a great and unnecessary amount of risk. MasterCard further added that, the recent adoption of regulation within Australia should also address the problem of anonymity in their attempt to curb overall illegal activities, especially illegal activities associated with Bitcoin. MasterCard went on to criticize the massive volatility experienced in the digital currency\u2019s exchange markets, linking it to significant losses experienced by many adopters. The volatility has reduced the intended utility of the currency and should be considered redundant in terms of reliable payment system. Bitcoin Community Responds Ron Tucker, the chairman of Australian Digital Currency Association, said that he was delighted about the submissions to the inquiry. He was of the opinion, that Bitcoin is a new technology and still very much it\u2019s in infancy stage and therefore, requires different and innovative form of government supervision. To exercise a pre-existing regulatory structure, which has developed over the years to accommodate a particular type of service would be unfair and disadvantageous. Bitcoin should be subject to government regulation however, policies should be made based on the new technology allowing the new regulations to accurately evolve in light of current observations made over the new technology. Economics References Committee Economics References Committee was mandated by the Senate to examine the new policies by Australian Tax Office and the overall impact of digital currencies. A total of thirty one organization and individuals have made submissions to the inquiry, including CoinJar, Bitcoin Foundation, Australian Digital Currency Commerce, Australian Taxation Office, Reserve Bank of Australia and of course the payment giant, MasterCard. The findings of the committee would be published in March 2015.", "date": "2014-12-07T10:11:50+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 12, "day": 7}

The second tranche was auctioned off on 4th of December 2014, consisting of 50,000 bitcoins. According to Reuters, the coins are being auctioned off with the permission of Ulbricht and his attorney. In the case of Ulbricht\u2019s innocence the remaining bitcoin and the cash value of the sold bitcoin will be returned to him. The current batch had an estimated value of $18.6 million with the total of 50,000 bitcoins sold. The previous batch on the other hand, consisted of 30,000 bitcoin worth around $17 million at the time of the auction. The difference in the value and the amount of coins is due to the decline witnessed in the bitcoin price index, throughout the year 2014. It was noted that the second auction had a significantly lower number of bidders as compared to the previous auction, the amount of bids coming down from 45 to 11. The reason behind the lack of interest is subject to speculation. A few theories blamed the shorter bidding period to be the cause. However, CryptoCoinNews\u2019 Caleb Chen claims that investors have learned from the previous auction that the coins are auctioned off for more than their open market value and therefore, doesn\u2019t offer any real opportunity for a quick profit. State of California Second in Line to Regulate Bitcoins The state of California is considered as one of the friendliest bitcoin zones in the US, if not the world. The number of merchants adopting the currency as a medium of payment has witnessed a rapid growth, with roughly four hundred businesses accepting the digital currency for their good and services. Due to the growing popularity of bitcoins in the state, government authorities have started mobilizing to stay up to date with the current trends. California\u2019s Department of Business Oversight have assessed the situation and confirmed their authority to regulate the emerging virtual currency. According to Tom Dresslar, a representative of the department confirmed the department\u2019s decision on the virtual currency. The statement addressed the department\u2019s prime concern, which would be the consumers and their safety \u2013 their objective, ensuring effective and reasonable safeguards against the risks associated with the currency. The department\u2019s positive stance of the digital currency was welcomed by the bitcoin community. Since California\u2019s Silicon Valley possesses billions of dollars\u2019 worth of vested interests in the digital currency. These investments could potentially help infuse the much needed funds to repair the current dismal condition of the state\u2019s economy. Moreover, California is not alone in their initiative to bank in on the growing popularity of the virtual currency, with Colorado also considering the legalization of the digital currency. Colorado has been reaping incredible tax benefits from the recent legalization of marijuana for recreational usage. However, due to federal laws, banks have refused to work with the marijuana dispensaries. Since these businesses are forced to deal in only cash, Colorado is experiencing trouble tracking and taxing the businesses. Hence, the legalization and regulation of bitcoin would serve to benefit not only the businesses but also the state in terms of accurate taxation. The Tremendous $80 Million Transaction via Bitcoin On 2nd December, a Bitcoin transaction took place, which completely rocked the entire cryptosphere. The transaction of 217,517 BTC, worth around $80 million gained significant traction due to the transaction fee of only 0.0001 BTC, worth 4 cents. Many theories arose across various different social media platforms, the most notable being \u2013 one of the bitcoin exchange giant transferring its funds around \u2013 most probably to a more secure location. Even though the shuffling of funds didn\u2019t exactly represent a transfer of money between two parties, it still however, signified the potential of transferring such a large amount of capital with bitcoin. Any amount can be transferred at any part of the world, across various different boundaries, at any time from any place, within a timeframe of 20 minutes, at a meager cost of 4 cents and that too without the involvement of any third parties. No single institution aside the Federal Reserve would be capable of transferring such a large amount at such a meager rate. This is where the bitcoin technology has proved its might, providing the option to transact millions of dollars in a single transaction that too at a negligible fee for whoso ever chooses to utilize the Bitcoin platform.

CoinJar intends to contribute to the growth of the digital currency\u2019s eco-system, their services attempt to bridge the existing divide between digital currencies and government issued fiat currencies. Coinjar currently offers their users three different services, the following are brief descriptions of their services: CoinJar is essentially a hosted Bitcoin wallet. The term hosted refers to a form of wallet which is meant exclusively for transactional purposes and isn\u2019t meant to be used for storage. The platform offers the best possible user experience on their highly streamlined web interface and also offers a multi-platform CoinJar app which allows you to buy, sell or even send Bitcoin at time you want. The CoinJar wallet offers state of the art security protocols, i.e. multi-step authentication and additionally, their customer\u2019s deposits are automatically transferred and stored offline for higher security. CoinJar\u2019s Checkout offers its users PayPal compatible API for merchants seeking to integrate Bitcoin payments in their operations. All of these value added services are offered at the industry standard of 1% Fee. You also use the CoinJar filler service which currently offers the lowest fees, in their attempt to provide merchants the most cost effective way to receive payments. The lower fees provide the Bitcoin economy a positive boast in terms of adoption, which has been positive received by the Bitcoin community. In late September, CoinJar released a hundred swipe cards through their early access program, CoinJar DNA. Swipe is the first Bitcoin EFTPOS card in Australia. When swiped it converts the bitcoins into Australian dollars for the payment, enabling Bitcoin transaction at every EFTPOS terminal. ATO\u2019s Ruling on Bitcoin Australian Tax Office released a guidance paper on the government\u2019s tax treatment for Bitcoin. The ruling drew widespread criticism from the Bitcoin community, over the harsh tax treatment for Bitcoin. On Nov 3rd, CoinJar submitted an inquiry to the Australian Senate Economics References Committee of the Inquiry regarding digital currencies and an appropriate framework. CoinJar suggested that digital currencies should be treated similar to foreign currencies. The oppressive policies adopted by the ATO regarding Bitcoin led CoinJar to migrate their operations to the UK, avoiding a GST surcharge on Bitcoin purchases. According to the company, despite moving operation abroad, CoinJar will still be maintaining a strong presence in Australia. Customer Feedback CoinJar started off as global personal finance company offering most of their services in Australia, the company grew out of its hometown and now offers Bitcoin merchant solutions globally. Their services have generally generated positive feedback on various social media platforms. A reddit user\u2019s comment on CoinJar Now, I\u2019m relatively new to the whole BTC scene, but I\u2019m learning rather quickly. CoinJar make it very easy to buy, sell, and maintain your bitcoins. I very much recommend then to anyone here in Australia who is thinking about starting up. Twitter: @glenmaddern I signed up for @GetCoinJar last night, probably the most beautiful site / app I\u2019ve seen on the web. Seriously great work. Conclusion CoinJar has been making waves on all social media platforms. Their user base has grown at an unprecedented exponential rate, a pleasant surprise for the Bitcoin economy. CoinJar seem to have carved out a decent market share for itself and intends to further innovate how we view and use Bitcoins.

If you haven\u2019t heard of it, Bitcoin black friday is when a number of merchants will offer unique items for cheap prices. Black friday is on November 28th so that is when Bitcoin\u2019s price should be at it\u2019s peak, as a disclaimer I must say the following is just speculation. Why does black firday have such an effect on bitcoin? Black friday promotes the spending of bitcoins. That means that people will try to buy them in order to take advantage of the participating merchant\u2019s deals. Once the deals begin that is when the merchants will also try and convert their coins to cash, using companies like Coinbase and BitPay to convert the coins. So does that mean that on 11/28 bitcoin\u2019s price will take a hit? Not necessarily. Once BitPay and Coinbase receive the user\u2019s coins they might not actually sell them either to the exchanges or to private investors. Maybe Coinbase or BitPay will decide to bet on bitcoin\u2019s rally and hold the coins for a bit longer? We can speculate and form theories but we won\u2019t know until black friday comes.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/10-reasons-bitcoin-better-paypal/", "author": "danish javed", "title": "10 Reasons why Bitcoin is a better alternative to PayPal", "content": "There has been a lot of buzz around the idea that this new digital currency Bitcoin is a better payment system than the already established played in the industry, PayPal. However, in order to validate rumors from facts, we need to analyze and compare the functionality and the customer feedback of both these payment systems. First let\u2019s look at the highlighting differences between Bitcoin and PayPal. To simplify, PayPal takes data from your financial institutions (banks, credit card companies) who holds your finances on your behalf and uses that information to conduct a financial transaction online. PayPal acts a middleman whenever you want to make a payment to a third party by deducting the money in your bank or card. The process is simple and you never reveal your important information to anyone. Except you\u2019re trusting PayPal with your money. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is like cash. It\u2019s your money. There is no middleman taking care of your money while conducting a financial transaction online. The process is simple and you never reveal your important information to anyone either, but here you don\u2019t have to trust anyone with your finances. Now that we have pointed out the key differences between Bitcoin and PayPal, let\u2019s look at 10 reasons why Bitcoin isbetter than PayPal and what do people have to say about it. 1)Decentralized \u2013 A trustless or decentralized payment network doesn\u2019t allow a single entity or clearing house to have the majority of control on the network. An automated process which doesn\u2019t require you to trust anyone. 2) Universal \u2013 Open source and available to anyone in the world. Sounds like the internet? That\u2019s because it is. Bitcoin is money without borders \u2013 just like the internet. PayPal\u2019s services are not available in many countries of the world. 3) Cheaper to use \u2013 The average fee to use Bitcoin is $0.0005 per transaction and that too is an voluntarily action to be taken by the sender. PayPal\u2019s fees, on the other hand, after taking all things into consideration is an average of 3% every transaction. 4) Freedom \u2013 The fact that you are your own bank can\u2019t be stressed enough. Bitcoin makes that happen. PayPal account holders are at mercy of the service providers. 5) No chargebacks \u2013 Once the Bitcoins are sent, they can\u2019t be chargedback unlike PayPal where your money is put on hold if there\u2019s a dispute by the buyer. This system has been abused by crooks and left honest sellers with their accounts frozen by PayPal. For instance, one seller on Reddit shared his experience here: 6) More secure \u2013 Bitcoin relies on private keys for security. PayPal uses passwords to secure your account. The chances of a hacker getting access to your PayPal passwords are much higher than your cryptographically secured Bitcoin keys. 7) Open source \u2013 It\u2019s an open source platform. Anyone can develop another app to be part of the innovation. PayPal is an institution with a central body governing its direction. 8) Less Friction \u2013 $0.1 or $1 million \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter with Bitcoin. The fees and time to process the transaction remains same. PayPal, however, intervenes if you\u2019re crossing the transaction limits. 9) Privacy \u2013 There have been several complaints of identity theft by people when someone has fraudulently accessed their PayPal accounts. With Bitcoin, your name and addresses are never revealed to anyone. 10) Financial Empowerment \u2013 Bitcoin has empowered individuals from around the world due to its versatility. For instance, Bitcoin helps Afghan girls achieve financial freedom On the other hand, PayPal keeps you in the same financial loop and offers no solution for financial freedom.", "date": "2014-12-02T22:25:52+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 12, "day": 2}

We have seen the power of social media platforms and the sheer profits they generate from advertisements. Platforms such as Facebook \u2014 which was recently estimated by bloomberg to be valued over $200 billion \u2014 and Twitter, offer the top paying advertisers the most visibility for their ads. Now imagine if they offered an incentive to be active on these platforms. This is where GEMS come in, the Gems network will distribute tokens, called \u201cgems,\u201d that will both represent the value and utility of the system, and reward users for their participation. The app will incorporate advertising, but companies will have to acquire tokens and pay them to the users in order for the ads to receive views on the network. Daily airdrop of gems \u2013 Every day, ~27,500 gems are air dropped from the Exodus Address. The ecosystem automatically distributes these gems between users according to their relative network contribution. Contribution is measured by the number of active daily users which were introduced by you to the network so far. GEMS is an altcoin of its own which runs on a separate blockchain. It differs because it is backed by the GEMS social messaging app. Furthermore, you do not have to own any gems in order to use the app, you can use bitcoin as well. For you tech junkies here are the specs of the gems altcoin: The app is not currently available and there will be a beta release coming towards the end of December. If you are an investor looking for an early start you can participate in the GEMS presale which is scheduled to happen in 7 hours on 12/1/14. You can visit THIS LINK for an exact time of the presale.

It has features similar to the highly popular eBay, such as auctions which involve bidding and also, direct sales A vastr majority of the merchants are from the United states and Asia, but mainly from Hong Kong, China and Singapore. Additionally, it also acts as a digital bitcoin wallet even though you are not spending your Bitcoins on the website to buy anything. The Bitcoin payment processing works very smoothly and it has received a lot of interest. You may also use your own external wallet to make payments apart from the built in wallet feature. The site, which has a neat and tidy design has been working in a partnership with the highly popular website CoinsForTech.com which has a commendable audience and has processed over half a million worth of orders. CoinsForTech.com spans over 56 countries and it accepts not just Bitcoin, but also Litecoin and Dogecoin. Also, OneWallet accepts only Bitcoin at the moment. The website, founded by Lee Marburg charges a fee of 2% of the final price for merchants but it is still worth it. He stated that the main aim of the website was to create a beginner friendly Bitcoin wallet and to provide an avenue for buying and selling of goods with Bitcoins. Customers are protected when they purchase anything from a merchant who has a \u201cbusiness verified\u201d badge next to his username. If any scam accusation is made against a verified seller, the company investigates the purchase and refunds the USD equivalent if they find out that it was a scam. In the future, there are plans to implement merchant remuneration through their local currencies and the company is already in talks with a few payment processors. Also, on the security front, there will be an implementation of invoicing features and multisig. Also, they have two factor authentication only for withdrawals and soon, they will be implementing logins through Google two factor Authentication (2FA) or via Authy.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/3-unsuccessful-digital-currencies-existed-bitcoin/", "author": "Mark", "title": "3 unsuccessful digital currencies that existed before bitcoin", "content": "Bitcoin was one of the many developments that revolutionized the modern way of spending and receiving money. It established a secure network where people could anonymously spend and receive money, and that too, securely. Also, people did not have to get up from where they were sitting, they could use their mobile phones as well, and the process of the transactions was really very simple compared to that of other net banking services, although PayPal was a major rival to this service. But was Bitcoin really the first of the many crypto currencies that we have today? Of course, it was the currency that revolutionized the entire process; it was most certainly not the first. Many people have tried to create crypto currencies way before Bitcoin, and all of them failed, evidently, since Bitcoin is at the top of the market. Here, we cover three of the most popular failures, three digital currencies that could have become like the digital currency Bitcoin, before Bitcoin itself. Beenz A digital currency for paying people is always better than real ones for matters like rewards for online services. Beenz was one of the first companies to offer a currency to be used for this idea. This idea predates to the 1990s, which is really very old. Beenz tried to raise funds, and on that matter, it gained a lot of traction, raising to around $80 Million. In 2000, Beenz made a deal with MasterCard, and things were looking good for the tech company. However, in 2001, the company started having financial problems. By mid-2001, it was publicly thinking about having a better structure for its products. It was then forced to create a separate platform for marketing its services, which turned out to be the end for this company as it was forced to stop spending, and then the company itself was later shut down in the same year. Flooz In the late 90s, Flooz raised funds for a product which was a digital currency merchants could use for accepting payments. It drew a lot of attention, gaining $35 million in investments though the company lasted for three more years. The company pursued aggressive promotions and advertising. It can be thought of like an online voucher, wherein people could be rewarded through campaigns or they could purchased from the Flooz official website. It carved out a strong presence but sadly, it couldn\u2019t capitalize on it. By mid 2001, there was a lot of allegations and claims that criminals were using its platform. All this created a sense of panic amongst the merchants and it was reported that Russian criminals were using illegally obtained credit cards in order to purchase the digital currency. It was also revealed that more than $250,000 was stolen. All these revelations forced Flooz to close down. DigiCash This was quite an interesting case since it came quite close to success at the world level. It was created by David Chaum in the 1990s, who is more notable for inventing the eCash system. This company created a crypto currency called cyberbucks, and they wanted to create an online currency which was both safe and user-friendly. They also made it anonymous, like Bitcoin, and this currency got a fair amount of attention, including a piece on the prestigious \u2018The Guardian\u2019. The company had various modes of payment, including a micropayment system. It used the email system for the transactions of its currency. How did it fall? Well, reports show that it was due to both a disagreement between the higher and the lower authorities within the company, as well as a lack of funding. The company got bankrupt two years after Chaum left. Well, there you have it \u2013 three currencies that came close to the level of Bitcoin, but failed. Why you may ask. It is possibly because, either that Bicoin just had a lot of luck compared to the other cryptocurrencies, or maybe that the technology needed to develop more before it gave us a successful cryptocurrency. Whichever way you look at it, you can see that Bitcoin indeed wasn\u2019t the first cryptocurrency, but the first successful one.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/5-reasons-bitcoin-kicks-swifts-ass/", "author": "danish javed", "title": "5 reasons why Bitcoin kicks SWIFT\u2019s ass", "content": "There has been a lot of buzz and hype around the fact that Bitcoin is a better payment protocol network than the already established method of cross border payments called, SWIFT. Is it just another smart marketing stunt or is there any truth behind the hype? Let\u2019s examine this for ourselves. First, let\u2019s highlight how both of these payment networks work in order to get a better understanding. Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is a network and a communications platform which enables financial entities around the world to conduct financial transactions safely. Its main purpose is to securely transmit information and messages between the financial institutions across the globe. Bitcoin, on the the other hand, is a peer-to-peer, open-source, software-based online payment system which uses various encryption techniques to securely transfer the funds between the sender and receiver. It also uses the same method to regulate and secure the network. Now that we\u2019ve discussed what Bitcoin and SWIFT are, let\u2019s check how Bitcoin is much better than SWIFT and how, in many ways, it kicks SWIFT\u2019s ass. Here are 5 of those reasons. 1) Quicker, Digital Baby! \u2013 In our ever fast digital world, users can shop, talk, stream videos in real-time.. why not send funds at the same time? Bitcoin enables instant, lightning speed transactions in comparison to the archaic SWIFT. An international wire from Japan to the US could take 1 to 7 business days depending on the amount. Now THATS slow. 2) Cheaper \u2013 Oh yeah! \u2013 Sending an email across the globe doesn\u2019t cost you anything, right? Just like the email, Bitcoin is also open-source and using it costs you a mere $0.0005 per transaction. Why should it cost you a premium fee, $20 for example, to send your hard-earned cash across the globe? Bitcoin\u2019s fee structure makes SWIFT look archaic in comparison. 3) Beyond Central Control \u2013 The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network nullifies the possibility of a single entity taking control. That\u2019s a big deal. SWIFT\u2019s independence was threatened recently when USA asked very politely to suspend it\u2019s services in Iran due to a political ban. 4) Transparent \u2013 Among all other applications within the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin also provides a public ledger for anyone to see. It\u2019s real-time! Every transaction taking place from every corner of the Earth could be accessed by anyone with an internet connection. With SWIFT, on the other hand, even if you went to your local bank to inquire about a transaction, you\u2019d raise a lot of suspicions. 5) Disruptive \u2013 SWIFT have had the monopoly over international payments sector since the last two decades, and USA can leverage the monopoly to apply sanctions. All of this has kept the ordinary citizen out in the dark. Bitcoin have all the signs of a disruptive technology which eventually empowers the ordinary citizen and lead a way for social innovation along with betterment. Bitcoin is decentralized, and is based on a revolutionary technology. On the other hand, SWIFT is outdated and is not built for our fast changing world. What do you think?

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/best-bitcoin-exchange/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Best Bitcoin Exchange for anonymous and secure trading", "content": "Before we go into ranking the best bitcoin exchange I would like to clarify that we are going to be rating exchanges ONLY on BTC/USD trades NOT any BTC/Altcoin trades. There are countless exchanges out there, they vary from transparent operations to anonymous off shore servers, some of which are scams and some of which are legitimate. We will go over and review all the criteria for the exchanges but first we need to narrow down our participants so a single digit list and then pick the best bitcoin exchange from those candidates. Lets take a look at this chart taken from BitcoinCharts: The pie chart above shows the distribution of trading volume of BTC among the top exchanges. We are going to look at the top 4 exchanges by volume, they are: BTC China, BitFinex, BitStamp, BTC-E These are going to be our candidates for the best bitcoin exchange of 2014. BTC China is a fixed-rate exchange where bitcoins can be bought and sold. The only currency that can be bought/sold for bitcoins by this exchange is Renminbi (CNY). Based in Beijing, China, the trading platform is the oldest cryptocurrency exchange in China as it began in June of 2011. The exchange benefited from $5 million dollars from investors which helped fund development after the initial investment by three founders including CEO Bobby Lee. BTC China is a transparent operation which requires personal information in order to create an account. They adhere to their own KYC (Know Your Customer) regulation\u2019s just like Bitstamp or Coinbase. However, the personal information is only needed if you would like to withdraw cash to a bank account, so if you are simply looking to trade BTC -> CNY you do not need to provide anything other than a phone number for 2FA. For conclusion, BTCChina is the best bitcoin exchange around for BTC/CNY traders because of its huge volume and transparency. If you are trading from China then that is the exchange for you, however if you are based in the United States there are better options for you. As we see above, if you are a bitcoin trader on btcchina then the only fee you really have to worry about is the withdrawal fee which is 0.0001 BTC for each withdrawal. This exchange offers some of the lowest fees available so if you are a chinese trader this is the place to go. We give this exchange a 5/5 because it is both secure and has the highest volume. The only problem is that if you are not a Chinese trader there are better options out there. Bitfinex is a crypto exchange which offers the following trading pairs: BTC/USD, LTC/BTC, and LTC/USD. It provides for much more freedom of action and leverage. The leverage is limited to 3:3:1 but that is more than enough for such a volatile market. Bitfinex allows to limit, market, stop, trailing stop, and fill/kill orders. Meaning that is has much more freedom/room to play around as a trader. Furthermore, it allows to borrow or lend liquidity on a free market contract for difference exchange. The main pro about BitFinex is that it allows you to short BTC, something which you cannot do on most exchanges. The above chart shows the fees for BitFinex. Unlike BTCChina BitFinex has no withdrawal or deposit fees but has much higher trading fees. 0.2% is actually a pretty high taker fee so that is going to knock off 1 starr of our rating. While this exchange offers great functionality it lacks in the security aspect. So if you are looking to trade huge amounts of coins go ahead, but make sure that you do not keep them on Bit Finex for too long. You can read about all the security/bug complaints HERE, HERE, and HERE To conclude, BitFinex has great functionality, but it lacks in the security aspect, so it receives a total of 3/5 stars for our BTC/USD exchanges. Security is the most important part of an exchange, no matter how much functionality there is, if traders do not feel that their funds are secure then they will be more reluctant to use such an exchange. In addition, high trading fees on every trade make it harder to day trade and still make a profit. Bit Finex is definately a great exchange but it is not the best bitcoin exchange for US traders. If you are looking for more functionality and features in an exchange the BitFinex is the way to go, but if you are looking for a more anonymous and safe exchange Bitstamp or BTC-E are the next candidates. Next is our beloved exchange the almighty Bitstamp. If you are a local trader on locabitcoins you will notice that most people use Bitstamp as the price indicator when trading. Bitstamps has the third largest volume of all the bitcoin exchanges right after Bit Finex. Bitstamp does not allow you to short bitcoin so there isn\u2019t many novel features available on the trading aspect. However, it is one of the most secure exchanges out there unlike Bit Finex. The only problem with Bitstamp is that they have very strict KYC regulations. In order to become a trader you must be verified with an ID and a utility bill in your name. The irony here is that bitstamp\u2019s KYC regulations are more stricter than that of any United States bank. Furthermore, Bitstamp has even higher trading fees than Bitfinex, here is the distribution of the fees based on monthly trading volume: Given the above facts, if you are a trader that mostly is concerned about the safety of your investment and are ready to provide personal identification to the exchange and pay ridiculous fees then this is the exchange for you. However, if you are looking for an anonymous way to trade bitcoins stay away from Bitstamp. Our rating for Bitstamp is a 3/5 because of the harsh KYC regulations and high fees, but the exchange does have high volume and great security. Last but not least, BTC-E. This is an exchange which does not require any personal identification information in order to start trading, just like BitFinex and BTCChina. It is the 4th largest bitcoin exchange by volume and has been around for a long time. The servers are hosted off shore and nobody really knows where exactly they are hosted at. It is very hard to put in cash into the exchange so it\u2019s best use is to deposit bitcoins into it and trade that way. The withdraws are relatively fast and just like many other exchanges it offers a built in tumbler, so that when you withdraw your coins it does not link to your deposit address. This exchange is also very secure and had no histories of breaches or hacks. The current trading fee for BTC-E is 0.2% which is not great but is much better than all the other exchanges (except BTCChina of course) If you are a trade that is looking to trade coins anonymously and securely the BTC-E is the way to go. We give this exchange a 4/5 because it offers both anonymity and is proven to be safe. The only downside to this exchange is that if it ever decides to pull a MtGox then the traders with coins on the exchange would have no way of creating a class action lawsuit since the operation is not transparent that is why we took off 1 star. In conclusion if you are a bitcoin trader looking for the best bitcoin exchange to trade Bitcoins anonymously BTC-E is the way to go. With low trading fees, nonexistant KYC, decent trading volume, and proven security BTC-E is the best bitcoin exchange for anonymous and high volume trading. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Bit Finex and Bitstamp are great exchanges if you are looking for more trading options or higher security for your funds. The downside of using BTC-E is the fact that the owners are anonymous also means that they can vanish with your Bitcoins any day, also if they were to get hacked there would be no way to hold them accountable for poor security. If you have any input/experience with any of the above mentioned exchanges feel free to post a comment below. Thanks for checking out our review of the top Bitcoin Exchanges and happy trading!

Some believe that bitcoin\u2019s downtrend is due to: Other\u2019s are anticipating a new phase of \u201cThe Real Bitcoin Economy\u201d. According to CCN: Coindesk has pointed out a different theory that states that Moore\u2019s law is responsible for bitcoin\u2019s downfall. My theory as to why bitcoin\u2019s price is falling is because the big hype/bubble has burst and we are just waiting for the market to stabilize and for bitcoin to fall to a set price. Bitcoin\u2019s bubble is very similar to the dot com bubble. To prove that lets compare a chart of the dot com bubble with that of bitcoin price. Dot Com Bubble Chart We can see many similarities between the two graphs. We see a high peak followed by a rapid decline followed by a rebound. While history does not repeat itself it still follows similar patterns. At this point it is obvious that the bitcoin bubble has burst and we are just waiting for a rebound. Those who are brave enough to trade in this bearish market might just get lucky enough to catch bitcoin at the bottom. Some trading strategies for you bullish traders are to slowly buy in increments on the way down when you feel that a rebound is coming soon, don\u2019t ever put all your eggs in one basket but scared money doesn\u2019t make no money as Young Jeezy said himself: Please follow us on twitter @btc_feed for the latest bitcoin related news which include bitcoin market analysis with market price prediction.", "date": "2014-10-30T19:19:04+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 10, "day": 30}

It is available on the Google Play Store for download for free. The wallet has many features some of which include \u2013 full control over your private keys \u2013 No block chain download, run instantly \u2013 Super fast connection to Bitcoin through Mycelium\u2019s super nodes \u2013 Watch-only addresses and private key import for secure cold-storage integration \u2013 Encrypted PDF backup and restore \u2013 Secure your wallet with a PIN \u2013 Compatible with other bitcoin services through bitcoin: uri handling \u2013 Compatible with Orbot (socks setting) so you may connect via Tor even without rooting. \u2013 Support for Bip38 Keys \u2013 Find other people to trade Bitcoins with and much more. Mycelium made an announcement that they are working on a new project called Entropy. Essentially it is a USB device that looks like a regular flashdrive which is able to generate a new bitcoin address and a private key each time you put the device into the usb port of any printer. The company says that the device needs a few software fixes but its functionality is essentially complete. Check out this video for a brief explanation: Transcript: Finding a safe haven for one\u2019s fortune is not easy nowadays. I recommend to have a closer look at Bitcoin, a digital alternative to gold and silver. To invest in Bitcoin you have to understand two things. The bitcoin address, and the private key. The bitcoin address is like the number of your bank account. Everyone who knows it can send you money. The private key however, is like a pin code that you need to access your account. You have to be very careful with your private key. If you loose it, you will loose your bitcoins. As any computer may be intruded by hackers I deeply recommend to store your bitcoins on a paper wallet. For this purpose I use this jolly device called Entropy. Each time you put it into the USB port of your printer it generates a new bitcoin address and private key that you can print out as a paper wallet. Once the entropy device has been removed, the private key is irradicated for good. So, it only exists on paper and can never be stolen by hackers. I have in trusted the heritage for my grandchildren to an entropy paper wallet. In this case I have split the private key into several pieces. Thus, when I pass away both my heirs and their legal guardian has to consent in order to access the funds. I love my entropy. The USB device \u2013 Entropy, generates a random number with 256-bits of entropy. That number is used to generate a paper wallet with private and private keys. Thus it brings a solution to 2 problems and bridges them in a nice way. One problem is the question as to how to generate a truly random number \u2013 which Mycelium solves by using the hardware\u2019s entropy. The second problem is the ease of creating a bitcoin paper wallet. This way the device both creates a random address with a unique randomizing algorithm and creates an easily printable bitcoin paper wallet. Here is how the results look like once the keys are printed: Mycelium further states that Entropy has additional security features unlike other paper wallets: The company is raising money on indiegogo and currently has raised $9590 out of a total of $20,000 goal. By contributing you will either receive a shirt, a Mycelium Entropy device, or if you are a business owner and would like to order 40 Entropy devices to help promote your business you can do so as well. One Issue I see arising with the Entropy device is compatibility. Since the device needs a compatible printer in order work it might be tedious to install drivers and configure the printer. Furthermore, many printers are connected to the internet which means they are hackable. However, the device does work with a completely offline printer but some printers store pictures of everything they print in memory which means that the paper wallet would be stored elsewhere. The device seems like a neat way to generate random bitcoin addresses with a unique randomizing algorithm but the fact that it relies on a \u201csecure\u201d printer in order to make that paper wallet might bring the security level way down. Now if a company came out with scratchable bitcoin paper wallets we might have a breakthrough.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-price-jumped-sr2-siezure/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Why Bitcoin price jumped after the SR2 seizure", "content": "As we all know SR 2 has been seized on Thursday November 6th. The FBI conducted multiple dark net market seizures as part of their operation \u201cOnymous\u201d which was a global law enforement operation which involved the cooperation of multiple law enforcement agencies across the globe. As a result, Silk Road 2 along a few other marketplaces such as Cloud 9 and Hydra. If you want to read more about the siezures please visit this reddit thread. This article is not going to be focused on the whys and hows of law enforcement\u2019s tactics to shut down the markets, it will be focused on the seizures\u2019 affect on the bitcoin economy. To start off lets recap, SR2, Cloud 9 and Hydra were all sized approximately at 15 UTC on 11/6/14 Below is a chart taken from bitocinwisdom btc-e starting from 11/6 up untill 11/8: There are a couple things to notice, firstly we see increased trading volume and a pretty dramatic upwards spike. Some may think that bitcoin\u2019s price is doing well because another marketplace has been taken off the market and bitcoin is on it\u2019s road to a squeaky clean currency. However, my theory as to why bitcoin\u2019s price increased is as follows: Firstly, since SR2 has been siezed and many mother markets were taken down either by the government or for their fear of safety, it caused a shortage of coins. When that many markets are siezed many user\u2019s loose their coins. As a result there is a slight increase in demand for bitcoins which gets accompanied by a price increase. Anybody can analyze a graph and explain/ theorize about the outcomes, however the real question is how will bitcoin act in the future? Lets gather up some more data, The first Silk Road siezure occured on Tuesday October 1st of 2013. Lets take a look at a 1 week chart starting from October 1st 2013, in this example I will once again be using btc-e and bitcoinwisom: This chart shows that the seizure of SR1 was the spark that ignited the bitcoin bubble of 2013, which took Bitcoin to the moon. Will history repeat itself and will the seizure of SR2 bring the attention thats needed to bitcoin to take it to the next bubble and reach a high of $10,000. Probably not, however it should come of no surprise if Bitcoin\u2019s value continues to increase because of the demand that occured after the closing of the few dark net markets. Because this time SR2 wasn\u2019t the first/only marketplace available we will not see as high of an effect as the one that occurred in 2013. It has been a bearish market the past couple months, are we seeing Bitcoin bottom out and slowly start to change trends? Possibly, maybe the siezure of SR2 will show its effect by changing the bitcoin market from a bearish to a bullish one, maybe it won\u2019t cause a massive bubble but if history repeats itself (which it usually does) then we should see much more positive power going to Bitcoin.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-dropping-eu-banks/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Why Bitcoin is dropping \u2013 EU Banks", "content": "According to the bloc\u2019s top banking regulator European Banks must shun virtual currencies until regulations fall in place. The European Banking Authority is developing safeguards for trading platforms in order to stop groups that would oversee each itnernet currency and ensure that no individuals are manipulating \u201cthe integrity of a particular currency scheme and its key components\u201d according to a statement today. Until those groups are established and the proper regulation fall into place, EU authorities are advising that banks should not buy, hold, or sell virtual currencies. As we saw int he past, cryptocurrencies have been linked with fraud and scams. If banks invest in cryptocurrencies and then a scam like MtGox happens the banks will end up taking a net loss which will affect it\u2019s consumers. That is why the EBA is taking extra precautions to make sure that banks do not loose money through such scams or frauds. While it is a good idea to stay cautious the fact that the EBA is telling banks not to have anything to do with cryptocurrencies is discouraging. There is a large gap between the banking/ financial industry and technology. When the world is caught up on bitcoin and understands the proper ways to store, buy, and sell the coins that is when global adoption will come and we will see the true rise of bitcoins, but until then we have to jump through major hurdles of regulation, merchant adoption, and consumer understanding. So the reason we are experiencing this dump is because the EBA released the warning to banks. As a result, any banks who were holding bitcoin are in the process of dumping it, and since the news just came out the dump is NOT over. Let us take a quick look at the market of BTC-E: As we know, the news from the EBA came about 3 hours ago which is right when the dump started. You can see the increase in volume which indicates the EU banks are dumping their coins. As a disclaimer the below will be pure speculation and we are not responsible for any of your lost coins. EU was never a major player in the bitcoin industry, it was mostly China and the US that cause large swings in the bitcoin price, thus, we might not even go under $620. The bearish market has been slow and no huge dumps have been seen lately, so this might be just another small dump and bitcoin prices will stabilize after a couple days.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-price-jumped-following-usms-auction/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Why bitcoin price jumped following the USMS auction", "content": "As you have already heard the USMS had an auction for roughly 30,000 bitcoins. The auction ended on friday and the winners were supposed to be announced monday. Surprisingly, the same person was able to score all the bitcoins because he outbid all of his competitors. One auction bidder claimed all the coins! In a statement the USMS said: If a single winner outbid all of his competitors then he must have had a very high bidding price. Since the investors and venture capitalists who bid on the coins mostly came from a technological background they knew the true value of bitcoin according to the exchanges. The fact that one bidder won all the coins means he put a very high price to the bitcoins. If the coins sold for such a high price it would not make sense for the winner to simply dump all his coins, because that would mean taking a net loss. As a result, the bidder will hold on to the coins and not cause a dump on the exchange. In addition to not dumping the auctioned off coins, the USMS auction attracted many investors in general because now people see that the government approves of the sale of Bitcoin and recognizes its fungibility. This whole positive reaction has lead to buy volume and unltimately a spike in price. Currently 1 BTC = $636 as of 7/2/14 on BTC-E: We can see a small drop form 650 to 630 probably because of people dumping since bitcoin rose so fast, however bitcoin stands strong at 630 and if the good news continues we should be able to reach $700 no problem. So now that the USMS auction attracted investors who bought bitcoin Newegg comes out with a statement that is now accepting bitcoins. Remember how the news that overstock was accepting bitcoins caused it to rise tremendously, well Newegg\u2019s sales are double those of Overstock, so it is only logical that the price will also rise. Newegg reported $2.7 billion in sales for 2013 compared to Overstock which reported only $1.3 billion in sales for 2013. Keep an eye out for bitcoin, the rise form 560-650 may not be the end of the launch to the mooon.

As you may have heard already a certain individual/account is trying to phish BTC by asking for a user\u2019s email address along with their Bitcoins. The accounts seem to be sending PMs to users on r/Bitcoin that look something like the following: It looks like the person is acting nice and wants to give away some Bitcoin\u2019s, if an individual wanted to give away Bitcoin\u2019s he would do that by only asking for the public Bitcoin address and would not need an email account. In this case the attacker is trying to link an email account with a Bitcoin address in order to try some hacking attempts. Furthermore, if an individual on reddit wanted to give away Bitcoins he could simply use changetip. So essentially you do not even need to give an address to donate Bitcoins. some individuals already sent their email with their Bitcoin address to the attacker. If you have done so then make sure you move your coins to a new address not associated with the email you provided. If your coins are on a Coinbase account then change your email or simply move your coins to an offline wallet. According to wikipedia: The way the attack would work in this case is the hacker would take the associated email address with the bitcoin address and then try to \u201cphish\u201d your login info to either your email or the account associated with your email and BTC. The attacker might ask you to sign up for a website or a forum in order to get the Bitcoins, or he might ask you to login to blockchain and verify your address. Maliciously the attacker might replicate the blockchain site, or any other site to which you will be tricked into signing up. This has done before, and you can check out the full story about the blockchain.info phishing attempt HERE Most people these days use the same password for multiple accounts and that is how attackers are able to compromise your accounts, by gaining access to one account all other accounts which used the same passwords will automatically also be compromised.

To convert PayPal to Bitcoin use the site LocalBitcoins . LocalBitcoins is a service that enables people to buy and sell Bitcoins between each other in OTC fashion, similar to Craigslist. The site advertises having exchangers from 162 countries as of 9/7/2013. It allows for not only conversions of Bitcoin to Cash, but it also allows for alternative payment methods, one of which is of course PayPal. 1. Make an account on localbitcoins by following this link 2. Then, navigate to this link which will show all the sellers who are currently accepting Paypal for Bitcoin. Next, choose a seller who has high feedback and who was recently active. You can check a user\u2019s last activity by hovering over the circle next to their name. Now the price you might see for the conversion of bitcoin to paypal might be quite inflated but that is because the seller who receives the PayPal is taking a risk which involves the buyer initiating a false chargeback. With PayPal a buyer can say that the purchase was fraudulent and initiate a chargeback, however once the seller sold the bitcoins he cannot get the money back. That is why the price to convert Paypal to Bitcoin is abit higher. The rest is self explanatory, you press the buy button and go from there. A few tips is to make sure you read the listing carefully as sellers post very specific instructions as to how to pay them (Goods/Services or Gift) and what information to put in the paypal message (if any).

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/how-the-usms-auction-will-affect-bitcoin-prices/", "author": "Mark", "title": "How the USMS auction will affect Bitcoin prices", "content": "As you most likely already know the USMS is going to auction off exactly 29,656.51 BTC on June 27th of 2014. The coins were obtained from the seizure of the SilkRoad. There will be 9 blocks each of 3,000 Bitcoin and the remained which will be offered in the auction. The coins in this auction are the ones that belong to the site SilkRoad and not to any of it\u2019s operators, the 140,000 BTC that were siezed from Ross William Ulbrich are NOT going to be in the auction. The auction questions the morality of pre-trial asset forfeiture since SilkRoad has not been tried yet. Furthermore, the USMS auction will establish the first governmental precedent for bitcoin fungibility, meaning that it will establish the idea that every bitcoin is equal as a unit. The bitcoins sold by the federal government hold no restrictions to their further use. That may be a trap that the government had fallen into. You see by allowing the sale of \u201cblacklisted\u201d coins with no further restrictions will make it harder for the government to prove in bitcoin related cases whether the coins really belonged to the person. A set of blacklisted coins could be spread around the network and \u201ccleaned up\u201d simply by being transferred to a new address or broken up. The auction notice reads: None of the above statements carry any indication the the USMS view these coins to be legally different than any other coins. In a way, the USMS is trying to maximize the return from the Bitcoins by not disrupting their implied fungibility. There are a couple different views as to how the auction will affect the market price of bitcoin. Take a look at this article: http://themerkle.com/speculation/bitcoin-nears-600-again-buy-or-sell/ There we discuss how the news of the auction affected the market price back when it just first came out. There was also some advice as to what to do if you are trading bitcoin or litecoin. Here is what reddit has to say about the auction, Regarding the auction, remember this: Every losing bid will belong to a very wealthy entity that still wants thousands of coins. One good point that is brought up is that the person who gets the bitcoins essentially got it off-market. Meaning that he was able to obtian a large amount of coins without disrupting the market, so in the end depending on what he will do with the coins that is where the market will go. If we had a scenario where we knew that a buy order would be initiated on an exchange we would be able to make better predictions as to what the market price would be. However, because the auction is \u201coff the book\u201d, the market will sway towards what the winner does with the coins. Not only do we need to make a prediction as to whether the winning bidder will hold or dump the coins, but we need to make a prediction whether the coins auctioned off will sell under the market price, at market price, or above market price. Most likely the coins will be sold at either the market price or above market price. Here is the tricky part, if the coins are sold at a substantially lower price than the average market price than it will be more likely that the bitcoin price will drop because there would be a bigger incentive for the buyer to quickly dump the coins and make a profit. On the other hand, if the coins are sold close to the market price then we will not see any huge effect on the price. BUT another point comes into play. Even if the coins are sold at market price, the bidders who lost would still want to get in on the action and might initiate high volume buy orders on exchanges.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/why-you-need-to-convert-bitcoin-to-litecoin/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Why you need to convert your Bitcoins", "content": "Bitcoin miners use powerful computers to verify that each person who wishes to spend Bitcoins actually has Bitcoins to spend and isn\u2019t trying to fool the system. They do this by reviewing the Blockchain \u2013 a digital file that documents every Bitcoin transaction ever made. Miners usually groups together in mining pools so they can combine their mining power and become more efficient. The power of the miners verification process comes from it\u2019s decentralization. For example, let\u2019s say there\u2019s a transaction that is going through the block chain. Each miners will review this transaction and decide if the sender actually has the bitcoin he wants to send. If the majority of miners rules the transaction is valid it will go through. But what if someone could get a hold of more than 50% of the network\u2019s mining power and manipulate the system for his own needs. Theoretically speaking, if someone manages to pull off such an attack he can double spend his money \u2013 meaning he can pay with the same Bitcoin twice or even more. The attacker will also be able to prevent transactions from being confirmed and prevent other miners from generating new Bitcoins. But more on double spending and confirmations will be reviewed in later videos. For now, here\u2019s a real live example of the 51% attack. In January of 2014 one of the mining pools got so big it neared 51% of the total mining power. This of course created some panic in the Bitcoin community but was fixed shortly after by miners who left the pool in order to balance things out. One of the things to keep in mind is that someone with so much mining power would probably make more money using this power to mine legitimately than by actually blocking transactions or double spending. This reduces the risk for such an attack substantially. It all starts with the miners. They are the ones who verify the transactions and the verification process is based on the MAJORITY of the miner\u2019s who agree that a transaction is valid. So let us say that a majority of miner\u2019s decide to agree that a bogus transaction is valid, in that case that bogus transaction will be accepted on the network and processed, which causes obvious issues. So, in order to get a majority of miner\u2019s to agree on whatever transactions you want you need to control EXACTLY 51% of miner\u2019s So if a pool has 51% of the global mining power of a coin it can accept bogus transactions into the network and disrupt it, causing a huge problem. One such scenario that could happen as a result of the 51% attack is that the pool owner who owns 51% of the mining power could double spend his coins which means spending coins that he does not really have. The above chart is taken from blockchain.info on 6/19/14 We can see that GHash.IO is at around 45% which is a Red Alert that it is getting close to 51%. It looks like there is nothing to worry about since the hashrate is so low. But is ghash telling us the true amount of hashing power that they control? What about this \u201cUnknown\u201d category, does GHash.IO have some miners in that category? Here is what noSlave has to say from reddit: Lets assume that GHash.IO does control 51% of bitcoin\u2019s mining power, what can they do? According to Bitcoin Developer Gavin Andersen: \u201cEven if GHash.IO is evil and intends to destroy Bitcoin they would be able to do only two things,\u201d \u201cEven if GHash.IO is evil and intends to destroy Bitcoin they would be able to do only two things,\u201d In other words, GHash will be able to double spend transactions, and selling bitcoin for dollar an an exchange then rewriting the records to look like it never happened. They would end up with both bitcoins and dollars so in a way \u201cdouble spend\u201d their money. However, there are many problems with such an attack. Andersen writes: The second possible scenario that could happen form a malicious 51% attack is a complete shut down of the network. In essence, the attacker, in our hypothetical case it would be GHash.IO, would stop accepting any blocks to the network. It would effectively deny all transactions which will result in a halt. The network would be shut off and any transactions you make would never process. However, this attack is also unlikely because of the social issues that would arise. Here is what Andersen has to say about this attack: The easiest way to protect your bitcoins from a 51% attack is to convert your coins to altcoins. You can distribute your bitcoins into different well established coins like Litecoin, Vertcoin, Dogecoin. There are coins who have many mining pools and are not centralized like Bitcoin is. Let us take a look at some charts. The above chart shows the mining pool hash power distribution for litecoin. As you can see the top mining pools have around 25% power of the total network, which is a 50% decrease then those of bitcoins. This decreases the chances of a 51% attack by at least half The above chart shows the hashrate distribution of vertcoin, here you see it looks similar to litecoin\u2019s. If you are worried about a 51% attack on Bitcoin or believe that GHash.IO may be up to no good, you can simply exchange your bitcoins into litecoins or other altcoins whose hashrate distribution is not as threatening. Don\u2019t forget to follow us on twitter for giveaways @btc_feed Will all the attention to the possibility of the 51% attack on bitcoin cause the exchange rate between bitcoins and altcoins to go up? That is a possibility and you should start watching those markets. We cannot be sure what effect the auction on 6/27/14 will have on the bitcoin price. But the introduction of 30,000 bitcoins into the market means more supply, and basic economics tells us that an increase in supply drives market price down. As a disclaimer the below is pure speculation and we are not responsible for any loss of your coins. As of 6/19/14 we can see that litcoin price has experienced a significant jump from 9.6 to as high as 10. As we discussed earlier in this article litecoin\u2019s hashrate distribution not as threatening as the one of bitcoin. So even if you loose a few dollars in the process of converting your bitcoin to litecoins you can atleast sleep knowing that the network will not come to a halt one day and all your bitcoins will be trapped for ever.", "date": "2014-06-19T14:59:01+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 6, "day": 19}

The following story is taken from reddit, where someone who started accepting Bitcoins for his services was wiped clean of his coins after a simple phishing site got his credentials for the wallet. The phishing website imitated Blockchain.info which is a popular Bitcoin wallet site. The site showed itself on the front page of google when you would search for blockchain. It used AdWords to rank up high in the search and when a person typed blockchain in the search window the sponsored site would show up. Now, when you go to the phishing link you will see all types of warnings so you do not have to worry about not accessing the real blockchain site. Here is what shows up when you go to the imitated site: thanks to this reddit post the site has since been reported to google and it took care of it. Here is a look at how the site actually looks, as you can see it draws a very similar resemblance to the original blockchain site and the imitation site did a great job copying it. The obvious answer is that you need to be more careful about accessing sites. The best practice is so input the direct URL of the site you are trying to visit into the browser navigation bar, this will eliminate any risk of phishing. However, the other side is that Google needs to be more careful about the types of websites that are allowed to posts for AdWords. The main issue here was that Google allowed the phishing site to display a clean blockchain.info link however, the original site is a redirection through a goo.gl url. For a better explanation here is a comment from reddit written by toshitomiballza: In short, it\u2019s strictly a matter of not letting advertisers to enter the URL address manually.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-nears-600-again-buy-or-sell/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Bitcoin nears 600 again, buy or sell?", "content": "We all know about the Auction that is happening on 6/27/14, will it put a dent in the Bitcoin market or will it cause it to rise? The answer depends on whether the buyers of the coins will hold them or sell them off. In the past couple weeks Bitcoin was rallying up to the mid $600s and starting around June 10th is when the news of the Marshall 30k Bitcoin auction spread causing a downtrend. We hit a low of 545 and bounced right back. The current price of BItcoin is $597 on BTC-E. The question everybody is asking is whether to buy or to sell. As a disclaimer the above is going to be pure speculation so we are not responsible for any lost coins in the process. There are 2 things we are going to look at this time, market volume and price range. The above picture shows the price with the volume. In the past 24 hours you can see the price jumped from 550 -> 600 which is quite a drastic change. But take a closer look at the volume, the jump form 560-590 is backed up by two tall green towers. That brought the price close enough to the threshold of the emotional number 600. So now without much volume and a price that is close to an emotional number it looks like Bitcoin is setting itself to stay at the 600 range. That is until the auction of course, it would be interesting to see on the day of the auction how big of a dump the market is going to experience. Who knows maybe there won\u2019t even be e dump at all. If you have sold your Bitcoins before the downtrend and are looking at a good time to buy in then I would say wait until the auction which will happen on 6/27. It is risky to buy in now right before the big sell-of. If you are currently holding your coins and were through the downtrend then I would say keep holding and watch the price, if you notice low volume and the price changing do not panic and keep holding it is only when volume increases you need to watch out for another dump. Some are even saying that the coins will never even see an exchange and that the auction might not have any impact on the price if it is sold close to the market price of BTC So here is what happened since the 16th. As we predicted earlier Bitcoin stayed at the $600 range, $590 to be exact. We had some ups and downs but now it looks like Bitcoin is approaching the $600 mark again. If we take a closer look at the volume we can see some action on the 18th, which caused a substantial price jump, since the volume has been low between the 20th and the 23rd we do not see a significant price change, the candles do vary but the price stays about the same range. If we do not see crazy buys or sells then Bitcoin should stay at the $600 mark. But with the 30,000 BTC auction approaching the market might experience a dump resulting from the buyers dumping their Bitcoins. That will only happen however, if the Bitcoins sold on the auction end up selling for a much lower price than the current market price, if that is the case then logically we should expect a dump. All in all keep a close eye on the auciton which will happen on the 27th. If you believe that Bitcoin will experience a dump you have 2 options. One is to sell your Bitcoins and exchange them to fiat. That will keep out of the dump and you will essentially side step it. The other way is to convert your Bitcoin\u2019s to another coin, such as Litecoin. You can read more about why you might want to convert to Litecoin HERE. Essentially when bitcoin drops litecoin will not be affected because litecoin will not be dumping. Then you will be able to fulfill LTC/BTC orders and convert back to Bitcoin at its lowest.", "date": "2014-06-16T12:33:03+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 6, "day": 16}

Since then there seemed to be a number of Apps that have since placed their appearance in the store. Apple is doing a good job with their policy shift and adding Bitcoin wallet Apps. Coinpocket is an app that is described by the developer as simply a wrapper for a different HTML5 version wallet that was available. As quoted by the developer Mike Enriquez on Reddit: Now it is wrapped for the iPhone and looks something like this: It has all the functionality that a Bitcoin wallet should have. It also has a modern design and is using the Google App Engine as the backbone. It has some added features such as a function that sweeps private keys into the wallet, it is a quick way to transfer funds from many different wallets quickly without doing tedious copy pastes of private keys. It also has the ability to generate a BIP38 which is an encrypted version of the private key. Now that Apple is approving Bitcoin related apps it is a race for iOS developers to come up with the next Blochain app. The controversial app that was removed and caused the damage of many iPhones. Now the wallet app that will have the edge is one with great support, features, and a sleek modern look that Bitcoiners will like. Perhaps a wallet that would include other coins in addition to Bitcoin would make a great feature. There are other types of apps that received approval from Apple. The first type is the wallet type apps which let you store Bitcoins. The other type is those apps that allow bitcoin purchases form within the application. The eGifter app is an app that allows users to purchase gift cards directly with bitcoin. So now you are able to spend Bitcoin in Walmart, Target, and all your favorite big retailers. For the record, the first app that was available on the Apple store after the announecement regarding the new regulation was the simple betting game Betcoin. It looks like we will be expecting many more Bitcoin apps come to the iOS store. It is nice to know that Apple is swaying to the direction of Bitcoin and not against it, hopefully Bitcoin will continue to climb after the Marshals finish their 30k Bitcoin dump.", "date": "2014-06-15T13:25:40+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 6, "day": 15}

We were able to hit the mid 600\u2019s untill Bitcoin suddenly dropped to below $600. What might have caused it? As a disclaimer the following is pure speculation and we are not responsible for any loss of Bitcoins, but it seems pretty obvious that the fact that the Marshalls are selling 30k Bitcoins is the news that halted the climb of Bitcoin. I am not trying to be a conspiracy theorist but isn\u2019t it a good time to dump 30k Bitcoin now right when Bitcoin goes up. Once the auction ends Bitcoin should recover and continue to climb, here is a sketch that shows the logarithmic graph that Bitcoin has been following, so even the drop for the mid $600s is not going to affect it much and we should still be on the rise. The above was the log from 2013 when Bitcoin hit record highs in the $1000\u2019s range. Now here is a picture of the current uptrend: Here we pretty much see that Bitcoin did break out of the logarithmic function on the small scale, but it did not quite break out of the large scale logarithmic pattern that is displayed on the bottom of the first picture. If Bitcoin does indeed drop below 500 in the coming days then we might have something to worry about but until then it looks like the current market reaction is simply a response to the news. By the way the previous prediction stating that the Bitcoin market will stay in the $600s and then decide if it is ready for another jump or will need time to refuel. It looks like the market needs some time to refuel and for this auction to pass until Bitcoin will be ready for another jump.

This time, instead of analysts reading graphs and making patterns we have concrete actions made by huge corporates who seem to be in support of Bitcoin. Apple started off as an anti-Bitcoin company when it banned the blockchain app and any other similar Bitcoin apps that fascilitated transactions from their App Store. However, recently they have announced an update to their App Store Guidelines which now allows the use of virtual currencies but with some criteria: There is no clear cut answer as to why Apple might have made the decision to update their App Store guidelines and allow Bitcoin related apps. One idea is that Apple is following Google\u2019s moves and how the Google Chrome Store allows Bitcoin wallets such as KryptoKit and many others. Furthermore, it seems that Apple is trying to satisfy short term stockholders to increase their stock and are making financial moves to tap into new growing markets such as the virtual currency market. A couple days ago Dish Networks announced that it will start accepting Bitcoin payments from it\u2019s clients. That announcement caused quite a surge in the Bitcoin price, you can check out the details HERE. Dish is a huge corporation that makes close to 13.9 billion in revenue each year.

It has made headlines in April by declaring that it has no plans to accept Bitcoins, however since then Amazon has been awarded a patent that mentions Bitcoins. Unlike Overstock and Dish who started accepting Bitcoin, the patent handed to Amazon enables a new revenue stream stemming from BItcoin. It centers around the idea of accepting payment for services without the services being tied to a single account. As an example, if someone wanted to rent computing power form Amazon for an hour, he would pay Amazon and get their computer power without even dealing with Amazon, they would simply make a payment using Amazon\u2019s virtual currency whether it is based on Bitcoin or the existing AGC (Amazon Gift Card) The patent illustrated how Bitcoin enables new business models and creates new revenue streams for existing businesses.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/4-current-threats-to-bitcoin/", "author": "Mark", "title": "4 Current threats to Bitcoin", "content": "In this article I will talk about the biggest threats to Bitcoin. The idea of virtual currency is not new, we have seen it in video games as gold and tokens which can be bought with real money. The real revolution is the blockchain that Bitcoin is based upon. Many compare the blockchain to the TCP/IP protocols when internet was first introduced. Because of this new peer-to-peer technology known as the blockchain we face unknown threats and vulnerabilities. Just like it took the internet some time to appear at nearly every person\u2019s house, so does Bitcoin take time to be approved, regulated, and accepted. The first problem with Bitcoin and one we are trying to conquer in 2014 is merchant adoptions. While there are many theoretical benefits to using a distributed virtual currency it is hard to put a value on it. As a result the market becomes volatile and merchants become skeptical of it\u2019s use. The appearance of Bitcoin represents something new to merchants, it offers hope to people jaded by traditional financial institutions. There are quite a few startups which are trying to bring Bitcoin to the merchant. One of such are Circle, Bitreserve, and Xapo. Circle is a Boston-based bitcoin startup that is a digital bitcoin money platform. It allows for merchant integration and makes it easier to use Bitcoin. Quoted from Jeremy Allaire (CEO) and Sean Neville (CFO): In other words, Circle is a sort of \u201cdigital custodian\u201d for it\u2019s customer and allows to use Bitcoin without running the Bitcoin software which powers the blockchain. Circle offers top level security and architecture to ensure customer satisfaction and ease of payment. Bitreserve is a startup that qllows fiat-to-fiat transactions at zero cost. It is able to achieve that by using bitcoin as the underlying payment system. It solves the issues of volatility of Bitcoin because it automatically moves the funds to fiat and uses Bitcoin as the platform instead. Finally, we have Xapo which is a company that aims to bring Bitcoin to life and put it on a Debit Card. The card would run under MasterCard so you will be able to use it at any local store that accepts credit cards \u2013 which is everyone. The cards are still on preorder and you can visit their website to order one. above is shown the Technology Adoption chart which symbolizes how a product gets adopted in the market. Which stage is Bitcoin on? Currently it is in the Early Majority stages as 76 percent of people do not know what Bitcoin is, according to Forbes. We also see that during the transition from Early Majority to Late Majority is where we will see the most activity and rise in price. So at this point we need to promoted Late Majority adoption and bring in new audience to Bitcoin. Merchant adoption is a huge goal to overcome but many are trying and it looks positive. Here are some statistics that may help you understand the importance of mobile support. As of January 2014 Because so many people use smartphones in order to bring in more audience Bitcoin needs to have strong mobile platforms. As of today Apple Inc. which is one of the biggest companies that regulates mobile apps decided to ban the Blockchain app from it\u2019s app-store. This means that it will be harder for Bitcoin to advance in the mobile platform because one of the biggest mobile platforms has banned it. We still have android which decided to take a different direction and allow apps that are Bitcoin related. Since android is owned by Google we have also seen positive reaction from google when one of the apps on the Google Chrome Store was removed due to a hack was later restored and the app was not banned. As a reaction to the Apple scandal Coinpunk decided to make a front-end Bitcoin wallet which is mobile-optimized and runs 100% on HTML. Coinpunk\u2019s purpose was to circumvent the Blockchain.info app ban from Apple and serve as a way for iPhone user\u2019s to still have a mobile Bitcoin wallet. For more information regarding coinpunk and a tutorial on how to install it please visit the following links: Coinpunk info How to install Coinpunk on Centos 6.5 Another problem facing Bitcoin are the bad actors which give Bitcoin the negative reputation and it\u2019s lack of trust. Because Bitcoin is anonymous is it associated with hacking and fraud. However, witht he right security it can be prevented. The two main bad actors which hindered Bitcoin\u2019s reputation are The Silk road, and MtGox. The Silk Road was the online drug market which has been since shut down by the FBI and which used Bitcoin as the currency on the market. This gave Bitcoin the shady reputation. However, neither the creator of Bitcoin nor Bitcoin itself has anything to do with Silk Road. It is not fair to demonize Bitcoin because it was used as a currency in a drug market. Do we demonize USD for use in the drug market? No because it is simply a currency. The other bad player is MtGox which was supposedly \u201chacked\u201d and all the user\u2019s with Bitcoin\u2019s on the exchange ended up loosing all their coins. This caused a huge selloff both on MtGox and other exchanges such as BTC-E and Bitstamp. The crash of MtGox caused the price of Bitcoin to plummet. Now that the bad actor\u2019s are behind us exchanges are still being investigated in regards to connection to the Silk Road. This hurts the Bitcoin economy because now there is a risk in being a Bitcoin exchange because you might end up with Bitcoins that were used on the Silk Road. Another huge threat to Bitcoin is it\u2019s centralization. Bitcoin is based on the blockchain which is a system that only works in a decentralized state. Bitcoin can be centralized in 2 ways. Either a centralized being hosts all the Bitcoin nodes, or the being hosts all the mining equipment. Take this, you don\u2019t even need to own 100% of Bitcoin nodes or mining rigs but 51% is enough. So let\u2019s say a company comes up with a super strong ASIC which is able to mine at 1 Petahash Per Second. 1 Petahash = 1000 Terahashed. According to Blockchain the total mining power of the Bitcoin network is around 100 Petahashes. So that means if a company is able to produce 51 Petahashes of power then it will be able to do alot of damage to the Bitcoin network. However, this has not happened yet and the Bitcoin network has been active for quite some time now so the longer it stays active and stable the less risk it will have for centralization. The other way Bitcoin can be centralized is if it will start to be regulated. If strict regulation takes into place then the Bitcoin network would have to follow arbitrary rules which would hinder the further development of the blockchain. However, it seems that is would be really hard to regulate Bitcoin because there are so many loop holes. The Federal government is looking at regulating bitcoin so we at least know it will not be banned. An active threat that threatens the decentralization of Bitcoin is that a big corporate can patent the idea of virtual currency and end up making it centralized. We can see evidence of that where Western Union has been granted a patent to Bitcoin related currecncy and that if other corporates such as Gemalto, Paypal, and Ebay get such patents it can mean bad news for Bitcoin. The above were the top 4 threats to Bitcoin. Quick look at BTC-E as of 5/27 3:42 PST What happened? We were doing so well and had a dump from 580 -> 550. If you would like to find out why we had a dump please follow this blog and stay tuned.", "date": "2014-05-27T10:45:00+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 5, "day": 27}

The message \u201cThis invoice is valid for 15:00 minutes ONLY\u201d is displayed and a timer counts down the clock. The reason this timer exists is to protect BitPay from exchange rate moves \u2014 the price quoted is only valid for fifteen minutes because of Bitcoin\u2019s volatility. If payment arrives after the timer has expired, an additional payment amount may be required to cover the difference in the exchange rate from the original quote. The automated solution and shopping cart is available for all merchants for a fee of 0.99% of the value of the sale. If the merchant wants to receive a currency other than bitcoins, (e.g. US Dollars) BitPay can trade the coins for dollars, and send a direct deposit to the merchant\u2019s bank account. As a result the Merchants never risk loosing money because of Bitcoin\u2019s volatile price. Bitpay was founded on May 2011 by Anthony Gallippi and Stephen Pair in Atlanta, Georgia. Bitpay received it\u2019s first round of real funding in January 2013 when the company announced $510,000 USD in angel investments, which was it\u2019s first external capital after being internally organized. Following that initial investment BitPay received an additional $2,000,000 USD in venture capital investment which was led by the Founders Fund. In December of 2013,Hong Kong business magnate Li Ka-shing invested through his Horizons Ventures firm about $2.7 million into BitPay. In May of 2014, BitPay received $30 million in funding from investors including Index Ventures, Virgin Group\u2019s Richard Branson and Yahoo founder Jerry Yang. This totals to roughly $35,000,000 USD in investments. On September of 2013, 2 years after BitPay\u2019s formation it was able to reach 10,000 merchants to accept Bitcoin. On September of 2012 it accepted it\u2019s 1,000th merchant, so in other words BitPay was able to grow 10 times in the years of 2012-2013. This was all done with the initial 2.5 Million raised from the Fouders Fund and the $500,000 in angel investmnets. Back in 2013, Commenting on BitPay\u2019s 10,000 merchant milestone, investor Shakil Khan told TechCrunch: \u201cBitPay is doing a great job at educating merchants to the benefits of accepting Bitcoin, 10,000 merchants on board is excellent news for such a young company in a very new industry, and YES, as an investor I am very happy with the progress being made by Tony and his team.\u201d Now fast forward another year and As of May 2014, BitPay provides payment processing services for more than 30,000 businesses, including the gaming giant Zynga, popular blogging platform WordPress, and the NBA\u2018s Sacramento Kings. Fifty percent of the company\u2019s merchants are located in the United States, while only 30% are based out of the European Union, and the remaining are sprinkled elsewhere on the globe. Today BitPay has processed over $100 Million in total and is currently processing $1 million in transactions a day. The word for Bitcoin in 2014 is Merchant Adoption, that is the name of the game. Right now Bitcoin\u2019s biggest goal is to attract a bigger audience which begins with Merchan Adoption. Companies like BitPay not only are successful in themselves but also support Bitcoin because it is a tool which promotes Merchant Adoption. The fact that BitPay was able to acquire over 30,000 merchants is astonishing. On the other hand, BitPay can acquire another 30,000 merchants and not make much of a difference if those merchants are small-time home businesses. We need to focus on the big corporates that have massive amounts of orders and volume going through them. BitPay should focus on processing more volume of transactions per day vs. acquiring more merchants. However as we see the fact that BitPay is currently processing over $1 Million in Bitcoin a day is already promising. However, is $1 Million a day of transaction volume really that impressive? Maybe for Bitcoin is its but at its peak in 2008 E-gold was processing more than USD 2 billion worth of precious metals transactions per year, which when calculated comes out to about $5.5 million per day. BitPay still has a long way to go but they sure are on the right track!", "date": "2014-05-28T10:51:51+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 5, "day": 28}

One of the most recent companies to enter was the colorado-based giant WestrnUnion. WU received a patent on April 1st which suggested that it would give the company a way to claim a certain aspect of the bitcoin industry \u2013 the exchange of the alt coins. This is a huge risk for bitcoin because it means that now monopoly-based businesses are going to enter and take control. Bitcoin is mean to be decentralized and the issuance of patents to such business is a step in the wrong direction. On April 1st the US Patent Office granted Western union a patent on the exchange of alternative currecies. Here is the tweet of when it happened: The patent number is 8688563 the funny thing is it was granted on April fools day. Western Union is not the only company going to the bitcoin market, in recent news IBM is building an e-Currency trading platform. They name it the e-Currency Validator which is similar to Coin Validation Ebay also seems to be filing a patent application for a bitcoin currency exchanger, an article about it can be found HERE Ebay is a big partner with PayPal, and it sees bitcoin as a threat to PayPal. It\u2019s main competitors are services like Coinbase and Bitpay. Ebay is a business and like any other business it wants to dominate the market. That is why it is going for the patent in crypto-currency to try and set a check-mate scenario to Coinbase and Bitpay to where they would either have to pay huge royalties to Ebay or stop services completely. Ebay filed a patent application where it actually mentioned Bitcoin (20130173416) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. This application was published on the U.s Independence Day of 2013. Further checking shows that the application was filed back in December of 2011. Ebay wanted to be an early adopter of bitcoin, but that company was BitMit. Quoted from the EcommerceBytes article: Gemalto also took a bite into patentin bitcoin related ideas. Gemalto has a pending patent application for a transaction method between two entities which provides anonymity without a trusted party. This one is the patent which is the most related to virtual currency. It was filed in April of 2008 it is an invention that uses an off-line divisible e-cash scheme that allows a user to withdraw a divisible coin of monetary value that he can spend anonymously and without any links. The full patent description can be found HERE The patent analyzer and the founder of the CDF suggested that the patent could have implications for alternative uses of the block chain, which is the mechanism that drives bitcoin and all the other crypto-currencies. Quoted from Jessen \u201cThey are proposing a cryptocurrency scheme without the need for access to the internet\u201d. Just like with Ebay\u2019s patent, this patent might not be ever approved or let alone granted. So far Western Union is the one with the ball so we need to keep a close eye on them. I have to make one point, none of these patents directly mention Bitcoin, however, they mention the way bitcoin operates and are trying to patent the idea itself. Quoted from the Western Union patent: Here we see mentions of alternative currencies such as video game gold and other popular game credits. Even though this patent does not mention crypto-currencies, it still will apply to alt-coins as we know them. You might argue that this patent is very broad. However, this patent has made it past the application state and has already been granted the patent status by USPTO. Western Union did a great job covering up their patent application and not advertising it to the public. Now the ball is in their hands to try and pursue its intellectual property rights under the granted patent. On the other hand, the patent might have been filed for defensive reasons in order to keep competitors away, instead of an offensive move to try and dominate the bitcoin market. Lucky for the bitcoin community one patent analyst believes that the threat of such actions is an inevitable one, and one that needs proper defense. That is why Reed Jessen founded the Cryptocurrency Defense Foundation or CDF CDF takes an interesting approach to defending bitcoin from patents. Instead of trying to fight those patents from being approved, In essence it takes those patents that have a relation with bitcoin, and controls their usage. The way patent aggregation works is by purchasing patents or patent rights and keeping them out of the hands of entities who would assert them against operating company. This mechanism is called Defensive patent aggregation, or DPA. What we fear Western Union will do is go for offensive patent aggregation, or OPA which is the purchasing of patents in order to use them against companies who are using inventions which are protected by those patents. In our case we fear Western Union will go for Coinbase and try to add its hefty fees to each transaction.", "date": "2014-05-20T06:29:25+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 5, "day": 20}

This records as the second largest database breach in history with over 140 million users compromised. We weak link in this cyberattack were the employees. The attackers were able to get access to Ebay employee credentials and were able to access the corporate network, which granted them access to the database. Ebay and Paypal urged customers to change their password because the encrypted version of the password were leaked along with the customer\u2019s names, dates of birth, addresses, and security questions. Now either the hacker or someone pretending to be him is selling the 140 million user database on pastebin. The hacker provided a 3,000 row extract from the database with names, addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth as proof. However, Ebay denied that the extracted database was authentic. According to an Ebay spokesperson Security experts used the 3,000 row extract to try and identify and narrow down the source of the extract. Here are some of the offers on pastebin for the compromised database: http://pastebin.com/vmvjGw3N http://pastebin.com/Tfs07HDp They say: and Ebay has confirmed that the database rows provided is not authentic but can we really trust that? Security experts are trying to narrow down and identify the source of the attack. One UK cyber security company \u2013 Digital Shadows \u2013 cross referenced the leaked data with Facebook and confirmed that the names are real, even if they might not have come from Ebay. We need a third party to either confirm or deny that the 3000 rows did or did not come from Ebay. Ebay might deny the authenticity of the database but for all we know it could simply be a business move to minimize the severity of the situation. The compromise of the 140 million user database is a serious issue from the perspective of identity theft. Even though Ebay is not putting importance on the data that was stolen, the consequences of the attack may be felt far ahead in the future. This attack is the second largest of the type in history. Some customers are concerned about their information landing in the wrong hands: The only item that the hacker\u2019s are missing is mother\u2019s maiden name and then they gain sufficient information to impersonate an individual and deal with financial institutions. While the password\u2019s were also hacked in the attack they were encrypted and hashed so the real passwords did not show up. However, if the hacker\u2019s obtain the private and public keys to the password they could potentially derypt the hashes and reveal the real passwords. The biggest problem with this is that many users use the same password for different accounts, so if the hackers know your password to Ebay they may be able to access your Facebook, Twitter, Bank Accounts, etc. According to Ebay\u2019s twitter: So this time we got lucky and if you are an Ebay customer than you shouldn\u2019t need to worry about your other accounts with the same password getting compromised. However, just to stay on the safe side I would change the passwords to your other accounts because we do not know what the cyber attackers are capable of.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/google-bans-kryptokit-a-bitcoin-wallet-extention/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Google bans KryptoKit a Bitcoin wallet extention", "content": "KryptoKit is a wallet extention for google chrome. It is available on the Chrome Web Store. It is an instant Bitcoin wallet and a secure messaging system that runs in your google chrome browser. With Krypto-Kit you are able to create a bitcoin wallet instantly without usernames or passwords, and it also provides client side encryption in order to keep your wallet secure against attacks. KryptoKit also provides a new feature which scans Bitcoin addresses from webpages and offers a convenient bulleted list in the wallet window. Today on 5/20/14 it was mysteriously removing itself from users\u2019 computers. Keep in mind that the application is storing bitcoin which are worth quite a bit. Since the application has no username or password and simply works by storing a private key, no doubt users started to panic. We can see here the various tweets that appeared: Users reported that the problem could be fixed by shutting down Chrome, disconnecting from the internet and then restarting the browser. However, now there is no need to do any hacking to get the application back because it is all fixed. Developers from KryptoKit were working on figuring out why this was happening and it was not known whether all users would be able to restore their access to their bitcoins. However, rest assured that the funds are recoverable, but some technical knowledge is required. It happened around 6:00am GMT where users started flooding twitter and reddit about chrome removing KryptoKit from their browsers. The buttons that were shown were only OK and Details so users found the their KryptoKit wallet has disappeared. KryptoKit is 6 months old and this is quite a big issue. After all they are a bitcoin wallet and it does not look good when your application which is the equivalent to a bank suddenly disappears. Lucky for the KryptoKit users one of the project\u2019s backers Vitalik has posed directions on reddit on how to recover you bitcoin wallet even if kryptokit was deleted from your browser. In the reddit post he wrote: According to the post, KryptoKit\u2019s first priority was to make sure that people were able to get their private keys \u2013 which is the only way to get your bitcoin wallet back . If you madea a backup then you do not have to do much just take your backup seed and pass it through sha256. Let this also be a reminder for you to make sure to backup your bitcoin wallet incase something like this happens with any other wallet. Keep a backup of your bitcoin wallet on a flashdrive somewhere off-line. It only takes a couple minutes to backup a wallet but the amount of trouble it can save you is well worth it. Even though KryptoKit had a rough time today with google, reddit users were pleased to get an official statement not 30 minutes from the problem. Shuai from reddit said: \u201cThis is the kind of people we need in bitcoin\u201d. Remember when Apple made the big move to ban the blockchain app and users started smashing their iphones. Well today Google made a similar decision by banning KryptoKit, or did it? UPDATE: on may 20th at 9:30 GMT Co-founder Steve Dakh says Google has now responded and reinstated KryptoKit\u2019s account, meaning users should now be able to access their wallets again. Still no detailed reason has been given for the removals. So Google is not like Apple after all, all it needed is some motivation from social media and everything is back to normal. Because no detailed reason for the removal has been given we can only speculate. Maybe Google removed KryptoKit because it is skeptical about bitcoin and since KryptoKit\u2019s upcoming it had to make a decision. For all the users of KryptoKit there is nothing to be worried now as KryptoKit is back up online. Now make sure to backup your wallet.", "date": "2014-05-20T11:34:24+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 5, "day": 20}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/why-bitcoin-is-rising/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Why Bitcoin is rising", "content": "As of today, May 25th Bitcoin has gone up over 100$ in the past week. Why is Bitcoin following such an uptrend after months of trouble and decline. Some argue that the price has been steady for long enough and now investors are hungry and are looking to profit, other\u2019s are saying that more people are finding out about Bitcoin and want a piece of the currency. Despite the occasional high-profile business failure, the fundamentals of bitcoin haven\u2019t changed \u2013 it\u2019s still a decentralized peer to peer value transfer protocol and asset register. People want a piece of that. Another interesting idea is because of the trouble of Ukraine + Russia which caused the rubble and the money market to go down. This has caused an increase in the price of gold. Here is the chart showing the recent price of gold. As you can see right around May 22nd is where the price had a sudden surge. This was also right about the time that Bitcoin started its run up to over $560 which is it\u2019s current price. Because the money market was down, this led to the uprising of the oil, gold, and bitcoin markets. Another idea is that Bitcoin finally has a voice in congress. Brett Stapper, the co-founder of Bitcoin investment fund Falcon Global Capital, filed paperwork to lobby members of Congress on issues relate to cryptocurrency. This company is the second to formally declare that it is lobbying for Bitcoin, right after MasterCard that had 5 lobbyists that focused on cryptocurrency last month. The fact that Bitcoin now has a voice in Congress and is also recognized by the IRS means that Bitcoin is not going away. The main reason for last year\u2019s crash was due to the fall of MtGox, the involvement of China (which inflated prices), and for the trouble with the federal government and Silk Road. However, now that the dark past is behind Bitcoin and merchant adoption is taking place, there is no limit. Furthermore, there are events happening right now on May 25th in Europe relating to Bitcoin. You can watch the live stream HERE.There were multiple events in Amsterdam (including DNB \u2013 the Dutch FED \u2013 attending and speaking). Also Bitcoin events are hosted by the ABN Bank (A Large dutch bank) and the ING Bank (Another big bank) of who\u2019s managers are speaking on stage. Mr Jan Kees de Jager was there. He is the previous Secretary of the Treasury of the Netherlands. He was not negative about Bitcoin (but warned about its use due to volatility) and even admitted he owned some Bitcoins of his own. The biggest benefit Bitcoin has is it\u2019s Merchant Adoption phase. We have seen new corporates lean towards Bitcoin and start accepting it. We have seen huge developments in development platforms for Bitcoin and other coins, and we have also seen the strength of the blockchain. As a disclaimer, the following will be pure speculation. One member on Reddit said: This may be true, from experience we HAVE seen that Bitcoin needs time to recharge before snowballing into a new bubble, however, has enough time passed to go into the multiple thousands as everybody claims we will? If enough people believe it, we certainly can go up a lot, but it won\u2019t be sustainable. And the bigger the money, the smarter it tends to be, which in turn doesn\u2019t mistake a bubble for a ball or a ball for a bubble. If you do the former, you will sell to soon \u2013 It will keep rising, and the latter you\u2019ll buy too late -it will pop. We still might be in the ball phase- mini corrections all the way up to bubble phase, but that bubble threshold is rising too (with every piece of good news), so it is hard to put a value on the bubble or the correction \u2013 whichever it is. Some view 2013 as the year where Bitcoin received global exposure. In 2014 Bitcoin will lay the foundation for a more stable economy. This should cause the price of Bitcoin to readjust and eventually stabilize. Right now we are either in a bubble, or in the process of price readjustment. As long as the combo of the great news continues Bitcoin should see an upward trend. Remember the last Bubble which burst around black Friday? I was able to sell right at the peak and not because I got lucky. I was able to sell at $1100 because I set a selling mark in my mind and decided that when Bitcoin will reach that price I will sell no matter what. You cannot be too greedy and you do not want to be scared because you will either miss the peak or will sell to early. If you are a Bitcoin trader (hopefully you are not trading on Bitstamp) and are looking to make the most profit off this or the next bubble just set a price where you will sell your coins as soon as Bitcoin reaches it. Do not make it an emotional number like 700, 1000, or 1500. But instead make it abit under those round numbers. Lets say you will be happy to sell your coins at $700. Set your selling point at $683 and as soon as Bitcoin reaches that price on your exchange simply sell and do not look back. One of two things will happen. You will either sell too early, or sell right at the peak. You cannot be too greedy because even if you did happen to sell too early you still know that you have made profit and can wait out the bubble and rebuy again. It is better to kick youself for selling to early and making X amount, vs kicking yourself for not selling earlier and loosing X amount. In the meantime let\u2019s hope that Bitcoin will break the $1000 mark in the upcoming weeks and we can hit new record highs in the upcoming months.", "date": "2014-05-25T10:12:49+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 5, "day": 25}

They said that the company is looking to stay ahead of the curve, atleast according to swedish standards. They were also asked how the payments with bitcoin were working out. Their reply was that everything is going smoothly except for a small problem that was caused on their end. Such errors are common because bitcoin is a relatively new technology and not many have experience in it. They said that two customers were overcharged a couple dollars but that the problem was fixed and the money was refunded as soon as that happened. Webahllen also reported an increase in sales. They said that it was nice getting acquainted with new customers and once again it was all going smoothly. When asked how many users payed with bitcoin they replied that it was the equivalent of one of their physical stores. That is an impressive amount considering they only started accepting bitcoin 3 months ago. Imagine how much more work it would have taken them if they actually opened a new physical store. Other companies should learn from Webhallen and use their data to make a better decision about bitcoin. Webhallen was also considering the possibility of accepting other cryptocurrencies such as litecoin, dogecoin, or vertcoin. They said that litecoin would be next on the list if the payment in alternative currencies can be arranged. Its a big step towards merchant adoption as now we are seeing more multi million dollar companies\u2019 positive reaction to bitcoin.

In order to keep bitcoin running and validate transactions there need to be bitcoin nodes available on the network. Bitcoin nodes are different from bitcoin miners or bitcoin clients. Bitcoin nodes provide security, one of which is security from double spending \u2013 when a user attempts to spend the same coin twice. The bitcoin network chooses random nodes and then has them verify the transaction and make sure the coins were not double spent. Bitcoin not only needs nodes, it requires many functioning ones \u2013 nodes that have the bitcoin core client. Anybody can run a bitcoin node as long as you have access to a high quality server. You will need atleast 2GB of RAM and atleast 20GB of storage in order to be able to run the bitcoin client. The first thing you must do on CentOS 6.5 is install bitcoind. now we will untar the tarball and start installing dependencies. You can find a tutorial on how to install the necessary dependencies HERE I will briefly walk through how to do that. If you don\u2019t already have it you will need to install git. first we update yum and make sure your original deps are up to date: We will need to install some dependencies from source so lets get to it, create a working directory and start compiling Berkeley DB 4.8.30 OpenSSL Boost Next we need to compile bitcoind. Navigate to the bitcoin-watch directory and run If you get an error that looks something like this: Then you will need to link the boost directory where the libraries are installed. Here is how you would run your compile commands: If everything compiles then we will now configure the bitcoin.conf file Now in the bitcoin.conf file put This will make sure that bitcoind starts up in the testnet so you can test functionality. I would let bitcoind run overnight not on the testnet and synchronize with the blockchain before continuing but it is up to you. One company (Dunvegan Space Systems) decided to partner up with Deep Space Industries Inc. for a campaign to put bitcoin nodes in space. At first it seems like a silly idea but in order to keep the bitcoin network functioning bitcoin needs nodes and there has been a decline in bitcoin nodes recently. The two companies are planning to build bitcoin satellites based on the CubeSet modular standard. The satellites will measure 10cm on all sides and will be called BitSats, they will look something like this: From orbit, those BitSats will act as bitcoin nodes and will broadcast out, providing transaction information that will be gathered from solved blocks. Looking at the following chart of bitcoin nodes shows the the number has been declining significantly. It went from 250,000 nodes in December to 100,000 nodes back when this article was written to under 6,000 nodes as of today February of 2017. Less nodes means less security for the network and one factor that may be contributing to the decline of bitcoin nodes is the fact that there are so many alternative currencies battling for their recognition and share in the market. Even with only 100k nodes the bitcoin network is plenty secure so there is really no need to start deploying bitcoin into space. However, with the market cap if bitcoin sitting in the billions there is no saying what and how bitcoin can and cant expand. Another problem concerning bitcoin nodes is their geographical distribution. According to the following map we can see that the majority of bitcoin nodes or located in north america and the west, so people from Africa have a hard time connecting to the bitcoin network because most of the nodes are so far away, launching bitcoin nodes in space will guarantee equal access to anybody from any point on earth.

It all started with a wallpaper app whose developers decided to make some extra money by using our cellphones as mining rigs. The malware, dubbed BadLepricon was found by researchers from a security firm called Lookout. Quoted from their blog post: Shortly after finding the bug, the Google Play Store removed the 5 wallpaper apps who had the BadLepricon malware installed. If you or any of your friends have any of these wallpaper apps: Beating Heart Live Wallpaper, Epic Smoke Live Wallpaper, Mens club Live Wallpaper or Urban Pulse Live Wallpaper, tell them to remove it unless they want to keep having their phones used as mining rigs. I am sure some of you might think that using your phone as a mining rig might be a good idea but there are quite a few problems with it. The first problem is that your phone does not have a graphics card or any other GPU that will be able to match up with a R9 290 or any other decent desktop graphics card. As a result you will get very little mining power from one phone. In addition, your phone\u2019s battery will drain at an incredible rate so you would have to keep your phone charging most of the time. The only way to really make money using cellphones as mining rigs is to create a botnet. Botnets are a network of hacked electronic devices that are controlled by one hacker. As a result if you hack 1000 cellphones and each generates a small amount of hashing power, combining all that power will yield ALOT of bitcoin. Here is a tip, do you feel that your cellphone looses battery faster than usual? Does it seem slow and unresponsive. It could very well be that you have a bitcoin mining malware running on your cellphone. The best way to get rid of it would be to backup your data and restore your phone to factory defaults, that will remove any unnecessary apps including any malware that might have infected your phone.

Coinkpunk is a wallet hosting service just like blockchain.info. It is a front-end bitcoin platform which allows to send bitcoin, withdraw, and deposit. If you would like to know in detail how to install coinpunk on a linux vps please visit THIS tutorial. It sounds like a simple idea but it takes hard work to create a secure wallet that will be impenetrable to any hacking attempts. You cannot say that the wallet is immune to hacking attempts, but you can say that it is highly resistant. Coinpunk runs on the google app engine and is mobile-optimized. It runs over SSL \u2013 which already updated and patched the heartbleed bug. Merchants want to use bitcoin in their payment systems but not all merchants have the resources available to code those wallets. Coinpunk is the first open source, secure, bitcoin wallet which is meant for the public\u2019s use. The code is available on Coinpunk\u2019s repository. The main benefit is the fact that Remember when Apple banned the blockchain wallet app from the appstore and blockchain claimed the bitcoin community will take revenge? Well this is it. Apple cannot block a website from its browser so it will have no control over users who use the coinpunk wallet on the website.

With Sean\u2019s outpost just one of the main charities running to feed the homeless with the aid of Bitcoin there are also countless other individuals charitable out of their own goodwill. ChangeTip has got the American Red Cross on board to empower Bitcoin users to give, give and give particularly in this festive period. ChangeTip has become the service of choice for those wanting to donate with their Bitcoins in a snap. Comparable to real life donations where change is the donation of choice ChangeTip is revolution in the crypto markets. Not only does it allow one click tipping to the charities/users of your choice it is also multiplatform. The ChangeTip service is one of the most popular services spanning several social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit and is even integrated in Youtube. A little back ground information on the American Red Cross reveals how the new organization which has teamed up ChangeTip reveals the wide scale relief it aims to provide. The American Red Cross is one of the most established American charities providing aid to those who are in need. Providing a significant amount of aid even during the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake it the organization operates at a budget of $3.5billion but with the integration of ChangeTip crypto may push the budget up meeting the needs of ever fragile nation. As described by Victoria van Eyk on the official ChangeTip blog the charity is known as one of the biggest to take on crypto donations. On another note charity seems to be one of the main benefits of crypto as other organizations have also jumped on to lend a hand to those less fortunate. For example the Humble bundle as many gamers will be familiar with donates thousands if not millions of dollars on a monthly basis. Part of this comes from crypto as since Humble began accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. If you want to grab some games whilst grabbing a few steals head on over to Humble.com to spread the love. To conclude, this new partnership will have plenty of benefits for the unfortunate who may not be receiving the aid they need. Through the aid of crypto we may be able to aid where fiat can not.

Offering dirt cheap rates for their GH/s, it attracted the attention of many with some users depositing over 10 Bitcoins to the site. Sure it gave a return on investment for some who had jumped on early but as of recent times it has encountered trouble. Many speculate the company was simply a Ponzi at heart but with the site promising refunds in January only time will tell\u2026 Cloud mining has been one of the industries that has seen rapid growth. With the popularity of bitcoin increasing so did the interest in mining these coins which was effectively mining money by most standards. Cloud mining companies started up with one aim which was to mine on the customers behalf. Allowing the customer to pay for a lump of GH/s the miner would mine making profit for both the operator and the customer (eventually.). However behind this facade many companies have started up Ponzi Schemes which are one of the biggest nuisances to the health of Cryptocoins. With many companies paying out \u201cmining profits\u201d from other users deposits, a whole raft of companies have gone down under due to them being unsustainable eventually folding on themselves. The Company have been under fire recently as accusations went rife that the company was simply a ponzi scheme which had reached its last stages. As baseless as these accusations may seem many people found red flags as the company had no hardware (or no proof of it), was not very transparent and was offering 5 year contracts. As the payouts started dropping many customers became enraged but the company claims the situation was caused directly by the pressure from users and other blackmailers who may have targeted the company. As seen above the threats came from many directions and with the privacy of the one employee violated may have led to the panic occurring with in the PB Mining community. Another reason behind the company\u2019s sudden despair may be the rising difficulty which the coin is maintaining. Pushing many miners out of the game the rising difficulty has seen profits for miners dwindle with many turning their miners off completely due to electricity costs being higher than profits. The graphs below display how the Hash-rate has been match by the difficulty pushing competition between miners to new levels with only big farms and newer miners being able to turn over profits on some occasion. On the other hand the flailing price of the Bitcoin may also be to blame for the slimming payouts. With electricity still being paid in fiat, the price hike downwards has led to the operations becoming unsustainable forcing lower payouts. In conclusion we may have to wait till January to see if PB Mining will honor refunds to those who were effected the most.

At the time of valuation, PayCoin was also informally launched on 16th December with an initial investment of $54.5 million brought into the market. It is also believed that PayCoin is part of a ponzi scheme with GAW Miners playing a major role. This staggering amount of investment was coupled with an enormous surge in mining difficulty as miners rushed to get their first PayCoins. During the initial launch, PayCoin broke all previous records of alt coins and attracted 40 to 50+ peta hash of SHA-256 mining power, the equivalent of Bitcoin network. \u201cSurging from 0 to 40 petahashes is unheard of,\u201d said Jonah Dorman, general manager and vice president of GAW Miners. So, is it yet another hot thing to buy on the market for quick profit or is PayCoin really bringing something new to the table? During the early days of Bitcoin, there were obvious scams where red flags were raised all over and yet the new blood got slaughtered. More recently, it has become slightly difficult for the bad players to carry out their illicit behavior. By masking as the greatest thing ever since Bitcoin, PayCoin is now utilizing smart marketing tactics to get uninformed investors involved in their very carefully executed scam. Lack Of EvidenceAccording to PayCoin\u2019s whitepaper, they have implemented Hybrid Flex BlockChain \u2013 a \u2018lite\u2019 version of blockchain ledger that will enable quick transaction clearance for the merchants and prevent blockchain bloating at the same time. Yet, there are no technical specifications of how this groundbreaking technology will work except a brief mention of \u201cPrime and Orion Controllers.\u201d Thanks, but no thanks, I think we need a little more than than that just to believe yet.A Floor of $20Another red flag which is obvious as the sun in the sky is the \u201cfloor of $20.\u201d according to GAW. One of value propositions of PayCoin is the price stability that it will bring to reach mass adoption. How will that be possible? GAW claims to have high net worth investors and banking institutions backing their project. They were going to bring as much as $100 million on the table to maintain a floor of $20 for price stability. The current price of a single PayCoin at the time of this post is $12.28. But, of course, no legitimate institution have shown any public ties with PayCoin and the current price may be associated with price discovery. Paybase \u2013 ZincSave PayBase is a platform to spend PayCoin at several merchant stores including Amazon, Walmart and Target. To this date, there has been no confirmation by any of these retailers about a prospective partnership deal. In fact, GAW recently purchased Zincsave which uses Amazon\u2019s API to make purchases on Amazon. A reporter at Coinfire explains:\u201cKeep in mind that if they are using Amazon API\u2019s they ARE bound to the Amazon TOS. Your use as a developer, company or anything else of the Amazon API means you had to agree to the Amazon TOS and they were quite clear to us in the latest statement that what GAW is doing is in violation.\u201d Conclusion One thing that this wild west of crypto world have taught repeatedly is this: Do your due diligence before investing. 95% of the newly created coins are scams in one way or the other. Since there are no regulations, there is no accountability and never invest more than you can afford to loose.

From ponzis to other less legal forms of business, Bitcoin has allowed all to prosper. However one sector of industry to positively develop is the recreational one. Gambling has seen the bitcoin scene change for the better with a handful of companies and websites developed to meet the demands of a ever growing community. Just Dice in particular has risen to be one of the most establish and trusted Dice casinos of recent time. With new sites starting up every month it has become hard to distinguish between the authenticity of casinos. However Just Dice has made a comeback and the once industry leader has taken its position back at the top. Just Dice, run by Dooglus, a highly trusted and respected member of the Bitcoin society, Elder members of the Bitcoin community may remember the site as a Bicoin dice site which may have been responsible for the Dice craze seen today. However since the increase in regulation and restrictions placed around Bitcoin, the casino had to switch to another cryptocoin. The CLAM. Where can i start with the review of a timeless casino. Not much has changed and for previous visitors of the site they will feel perfectly at home with the traditional and simple dive interface which had been the same one in use for over a year. The controls are very simple and to a gambler all you would need for some good old fashioned fun. The GUI is simple but intuitive, with all buttons and controls needed within easy reach. However the absence of a Auto Roll bot on the site may make users feel uncomfortable as this has become the norm for the majority of other Dice sites such as Prime Dice and Coinichiwa. The provably fair feature of the site has proved the honesty and trustworthiness of the site and has given confidence to its players. Having the feature with in easy reach allowing users to verify their rolls has proven to be one feature that lets players play with peace of mind as there is manipulation being done to your results. The investing feature of the site is one of the most interesting features a investor can find. Aside from the gambling going on Just Dice also offers users the option to invest and own a share of the house. The investment feature has been regarded as one of the best as not only has it been completely transparent with the sites stats updating in real time on the front page, it also offers those not wanting to gamble a chance to invest. Investing has been seen as a less risky way of truning some profit and at Just Dice the feature has worked its charm. With the site currently in profit with over 12k clams users have found best returns available at the site. Another feature of the site worth mentioning is the chatbox. Normally known as the trollbox the sites chat is simple, stripped of any fancy CSS leaving a clean and minimalist feel. The chat also allows you to see worthwhile bets and if you don\u2019t then you can have big bets displaying on a different section under the chat. With the chatbot also on hand to serve tips to users the community of the site is also amazing to be part of. Whilst not every character on the site is friendly you can expect to see the owner Dooglus monitoring the chat. To conclude, the site has brought back the traditional feel and fun of a dice site. With the site that kick started the whole phenomenon of Dice, back it seems as if it had never left. Already amassing a huge following the site is successful (for the gambler and investor depending on your luck) and has all the features many sought to bring back. Having a simple, stripped down dice game that does what you want may just be what many had in mind. Flashy CSS and jaw dropping site art may not be part of the sites overall aesthetic but the simple and friendly feel of the site was worth the wait.", "date": "2014-12-29T22:16:24+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 12, "day": 29}

With even the wallet boasting exotic imagery the coin has been holding nothing back, revealing all it has to offer to the consumer. With even the wallet leaving a lot to be desired the coin aims to appeal to the classy and refined miners among you. Under the hood the coin may seems as if its just another scrypt coin but what makes the coin unique and amazing to work with has to be its community. The ever increasing popularity of the coin and its great community have brought about change rallying the coin even in the more popular exchanges such as Cryptsy. http://tittiecoin.com/images/bizPic.jpg Aside from the community the developers have also got to be commended on their hard work, dedication and management regarding the coin. The coin may not have live the traditional altcoin lifespan with many being write offs. The developers have been committed to the coin even implementing some cheesy features in the roadmap. The coin has always been aimed at the adult industry and with the TittieTube planned as a in house entertainment channel dedicated to accepting the coin as a payment method. As far as entertainment goes the coin also explains how it does not go about degrading women, but simply takes notice of their beauty propping them on the pedestal they deserve. In terms of the market the coin has shown it is a formidable force. With the coin being accepted on the cryptsy due to popular demand the sky is the limit for the coin. Becoming accepted by the massive exchange led to the market cap of the coin increasing to 155 Bitcoins and pushed the daily trade volume close to a bitcoin. The positive affects were also felt on the value of the TittieCoin as the coin saw its value rise to an average of 16 satoshis a piece slowly from a price of just 8 satoshi which was seen just a few days ago. The future has a lot to hold for the coin. With adoption spiking as adult industries welcome the chance to dip their toes in the world of Crypto.

The prices are set to rise further with highs of 18-20 satoshi anticipated.

Having a currency which offers these benefits but having a wallet which contradicts them is useless and contradictory to say the least. This led to controversy erupting as CoinBase started taking action against those suspected of taking part in illegal activities. Theres only one way to find out what a user is doing with their Bitcoins and thats to trace their activity, essentially voiding any protection using the cryptocurrency would offer. Whilst many would consider using cryptocurrencies provides them financial freedom and the complete independence to spend their money where ever they like, Coinbase has come out in force banning accounts they even suspect of illegal activity. Whilst many would say if its your money you should have the right to spend it on whatever you like and that was one of Bitcoins benefits. Allowing users to escape the prying eyes of the government the currency is hailed for its privacy and security. As of recent CoinBase, the major wallet provider has decided to track and trace the activity from your address to effectively \u2018see\u2019 where and what you spend your Bitcoin on. A little digging through the terms and conditions of CoinBase uncovers how the service essentially suspends accounts which are associated with illegal activity but assets will not be frozen allowing one to move their fund out into other wallets. There may also be benefits to be reaped if the system was functioning correctly as genuine user taking part in illegal activity will be stopped providing protection to some users. However many user have complained that the algorithms used to single out accounts has led to a considerable amount of users finding their accounts banned for no apparent reason. In one paticular case a user was accused of drug dealing using Bitcoin and their account was subsequently locked. Following financial regulations and keeping to the dictats set by government may not be the idea users had when Bitcoin was first born. Bitcoin, the coin supposed to allow true freedom privacy and security to users has faced tough opposition from governments all over the world and even the very wallets used to store bitcoin.

With CEO, Josh Garza\u2019s vision one of the boldest some say expectations will soon bring the coin to a halt. Josh Garza expects market capitalization to $250 million with the coin propelling itself among a huge haul of others. The moment the coin launched, eyebrows were raised. With the coin coming out of GAWMiners, hated and loved by the masses, many assumed something shady may have been in the works. Initially the PayCoin was under fire by many customers who had seen an announcement from Gaw Miners stating how they had obtained considerable support from the likes of \u201cAmazon and eBay\u201d. This announcement was instantly quashed by the members of the Bitcoin society as a brief chat with the representatives brought everything in to perspective. Neither was Amazon or eBay going to partner with GAW and endorse the new PayCoin. With threats of lawsuit from the two companies as GAW had falsely used the name of the reputable companies to mislead companies. On the other hand many believe the entire community was mislead into purchasing the coin during the ICO\u2019s. With almost 3 ICO funding rounds held many became suspicious of the need for this buying. After all why wouldn\u2019t they, with a whole host of ICO\u2019s simply allowing developers to run whats to stop Josh Garza from running away with users money. The ICO\u2019s of countless other coins such as Bytecent have been a simple way for developers to make some easy cash. With near to $250 million theirs plenty of incentive for Josh to run. The coin is supposedly offering buy support at $20 soon, which is nearly twice the coins current market value. Many financial experts would laugh this claim off as it will simply be unsustainable and in the end unprofitable for GAW to keep the coin a float. The significant premine and centralized nature of the coin has also come under fire. With the coin completely being under GAW control they can manipulate it to their hearts content if the wish to do so. With a significant premine of over 12 million the coin shows another red flag. The premine and centralized nature of the currency mean the developers can manipulate the markets easily. In the case of many altcoins rogue developers have kept significant premines and let them loose on the market once prices hit suitable levels which would make profit for developers. Shady market activity and transaction history have also caused concern. With over 50 prime addresses containing more than half of the total coins supply manipulation again is a constant issue. Market activity has also been pointed out as being a clear form of evidence the CEO of GAW is planning a Pump and dump scenario. With the coin rising over 40% in a single day and no decrease in sight, the value of the coin has been skyrocketing. This rise in value is unnatural to say the least as normal market conditions would force volatility to affect the coin but in the case of PayCoin there always seems to be customers, or investors, wanting to pay a higher price. Wanting to dump eventually or genuinely wanting to invest this market activity is peculiar to say the least. The views expressed in the article are wholly of the author and not of BTCFeed.

Unknown to many users this attack has been confirmed by a few sources who have yet to be revealed to the public. In a blog post the Tor Project explained how the attack may be orchestrated from with in the network itself further amplifying its destructive powers. The next few days will reveal what is to happen to the future of the network. Untold destruction may occur or the threat may be called off as a bluff. The longstanding network has received its fair share of damage as users can recall how attacks on the network have caused users to become disgruntled. Something on this scale is a first even for the Tor Service. With the attack coming from the Directory Authorities which are some of the most important components in the Tor network providing the anonymity and security users rely upon. With the Tor network surprisingly centralized, a attack on this scale may be devastating, Many have confirmed how if the attack was to go ahead, traffic flowing through the network may be hijacked. This exploit will allow the attackers to see all/most of the traffic sent meaning the anonymity provided will be compromised. The stereotypes linked to those using Tor are particularly strong. With common views negative its not surprising the grunt of government force is aimed at them. Known to be the tool of choice for hackers, fraudsters and criminals Tor has become a service misused by the evil. Used as cover for cirminals Tor has earnt its name for the wrong reasons. However the service has become ideal for many useful companies operating for legal reasons. Speculators suspect the FBI is playing a pivotal role in the planned attacks. Many believe the attack to be a revenge attack on the network. The FBI supposedly suspect North Koran Hackers to be hiding under Tor who may have been reposinsible for the recent spate of attacks on Sony. To conclude, the impending threat on Bitcoin may affect your user experience. Threatening your privacy and safety its recommended you do not undertake any sensitive actions such as transferring bitcoins or entering certain sites. The blog too will be updated in the event of a attack so keep one eyes on the blog just in case.

Providing annonimity and safety to drug dealers, fraudsters and even arms dealers, the dark web has thrived side by side with Bitcoin. However the US governments clampdown on dark web businesses came out in force with the Silk Road being one of the main targets. Raising hundreds of thousands dollars on a daily basis the drug marketplace had become popular and associated with a whole variety of illegal business. The moment Silk Road fell from its pedestal, the US government saw Ross Ulbricht as one of the main operators of the drug dealing marketplace. The trial has been the subject of much controversy as initially charges of narcotics distribution, computer hacking and money laundering were put forward against the Silk Road operator. Charges of murder may also be put on to the already lenghty rapsheet as accusations of murder are hovering in the air. The Silk Road was also suspected to be a vendor of illicit deals between hitmen and their customers. The defense team for the Silk Road operator argued that the refusal to reveal the names of witness had unnecessarily made their case much harder to pull together. With out access to email or any communication to the outside from jail the defense team argued that Ulbricht had \u201cextremely limited access to the outside world.\u201d They also reported that the murder charges that were sought to be brought by the prosecuters may have been part of a smear campaign to diminish the reputation Ulbricht had maintained among his countless followers. Many believed that Ulbricht had only supported and permitted business that was victim-less, but since the murder charges were rumored, the respect many had for Ulbricht vanished. However the Judge failed to sympathies with Ulbricht as the defense teams plea was not granted. Forrest claimed that Ulbrich still has the power to order the killings of the witnesses. Judge Forrest cited how Ulbricht had previously attempted an assassination of Curtis Clark Green, via a hitman who he had paid $80 000. The plan was foiled as the \u201chitman\u201d was revealed to be a Undercover DEA agent. A FBI account was also highlighted which claimed the former operator had ordered and paid for the murder of 6 people with one being a employee of the site who Ulbricht had suspected would defect and reveal his identity to the police.

Gox?", "content": "Ever since the massive Mt Gox debacle that took place earlier this year, Bitcoin exchanges have been subjected to high scrutiny by active traders in Bitcoin market. The collapse of Mt Gox was a serious deterrent to Bitcoin\u2019s image in the mainstream media. The exchange that once conducted 70% of Bitcoin trading volume was a scam after all. Who\u2019s to say that there isn\u2019t another Mt Gox in the making? A number of Chinese exchanges sprouted up to replace Mt Gox and eventually take over a big share of the market. Among those exchanges, Houbi, OkCoin and BTCCHINA were at the forefront. The global trading volume of BTC/CNY has been over 70% for months with highs up to 89% on some days. Their huge volumes have been the linchpin of debate over their validity and legitimacy. One notable reason, out of many, that may explain the sudden rise of volume in these exchange is that several of these exchanges have 0% trading fees on their platform. This has stirred a lot of controversy and suspicions about what\u2019s really going behind the doors. Out of these three big exchanges, one reddit user criticized OKCoin:\u201cThey say \u201cmaking money is not their focus\u201d, but that\u2019s awfully hard to swallow coming from a company with so much money invested into it. When they do finally decide to profit, how will they do so?\u201dTo be precise, his concern is a fair one. When the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange claims that making money is not their focus, something seems fishy. Admittedly, OKCoin is currently a leader in trading volume. Following the accusations of faking trade volume, OkCoin conducted auditing of their balances which resulted into positive proof of reserve outcome by 104%. Now, how do customers verify that this audit was indeed a real one and not another smart tactic by the company to keep the scam going? A reddit user made a statement:\u201cProof of reserves is a useless audit tactic that sates idiots. There is no way for your users to validate any of it, and no way to validate your fiat reserves and cryptocurrency reserves are 100% all at once. Unfortunately this is a difficult problem to solve, but maybe something that could be done by a REAL auditor from one of the top firms in the world, like Ernst & Young, etc.\u201dAnother point to note here is Okcoin provides a peer to peer funding option that enables leveraged trading (upto 3x). Combine this with 0% fees, the liquidity provided by being the worlds largest exchange, the artificial stability of the Chinese Yuan, and its easy to see why they\u2019ve become so dominant.While OkCoin poses as a market leader in trading volume, Bitcoin users are growing wary of centralization. It also become very clear that a decentralized technology can not and must not survive within the hands of central entities. OkCoin is yet another intermediary and users must conduct due diligence before trading on their platform.

With over 250 Bitcoins stolen from the Blockchain wallet, but thankfully returned (just last week), users have become much more security aware over the dangers of using online wallets for bitcoin storage. Malicious Tor nodes, weak encryption are just to of the constant problems which are encountered with web wallet use and Hardware wallets have become a cheap and reliable option for many. The USB Armory wallet launches early 2015 with one ambition, to introduce a new standard in financial security. With the developers at Armory working to perfect a solution intended to be as functional and suited to its main purpose, to help people manage Bitcoins securely and efficiently.

The open source USB armory is caseless exposing the hardware marvel designed by the engineers. Packing a ARM Coretex processor and 512 MB of DDR3 Ram the computer on a stick is great value for money and on the bleeding edge of portable technology. However the USB Armory has some way to go to match up to the likes of the Trezor hardware wallet as whilst the USB Armory supports the Electrum wallet out of the box, Trezor has simplicity on its side. With abilities to trade, send and receive bitcoin with the touch of a button, the established hardware wallet has seen sales rocket to unseen levels. The USB computer however is not be underestimated as this experiment pushes the boundaries between computing the portability. The need for hardware wallets in increasing rapidly with the flaws and security breaches wiping bitcoins from users of web wallets. Generating weak private keys and weak encryption has led to Blockchain.info coming under fire for failing its duties. With it being delisted from the official Bitcoin website many have followed suit and opted for offline storage such as cold storage solutions. Whilst improvements and advances are being made in the field of web wallets security is much more tighter when utilizing offline storage solutions. An ongoing crowd funding opportunity is underway at Crowd Supply where the company behind USB Armory is hoping to raise $65k, Once this has been funded the company will release a limited supply of 40 USB\u2019s and production will go underway with the aid of the extra $65k.

The dream of an Information Superhighway where anyone will be able to participate is now a reality. But, an impending doom still surrounds the core principals of the Internet. Despite the recent advancements in the protocol, it still remains vulnerable to attacks and intrusion by governments and corporations of the world. They exploit this vulnerability to impose censorships or to keep an ongoing survelliance. The current architecture of the Web was design by a formal employee of CERN, Tim Berns Lee. He inherited the decentralized design philosophy of ARPANET, the precusor of today\u2019s internet. The Web that we use today is decentralized in it\u2019s structure, in a sense that there is no official central authority or a central point failure, but instead each content serving website relies on its own independent server. These servers are connected to the Internet by using a shared protocol which then acts as a single network among the millions of similar networks connected to the Internet. The problem lies here within this individual server which is called a \u2018node\u2019 in computer networking terminology. A single node of the Web is vulnerable to central point of failures. It\u2019s a major flaw in the design, but nothing that can\u2019t be worked on. For instance, if a single node can be shut down or controlled, there needs to be a solution where a website can still function without it. The solution? Ever since the rise of Bitcoin, Peer to Peer (P2P) technology is being looked at by different developers from all four corners. In a post on the official BitTorrent blog, CEO Eric Klinker announced an invite-only private alpha test for a P2P-based web browser called Project Maelstrom. \u201cIt started with a simple question. What if more of the web worked the way BitTorrent does? Project Maelstrom begins to answer that question with our first public release of a web browser that can power a new way for web content to be published, accessed and consumed. Truly an Internet powered by people, one that lowers barriers and denies gatekeepers their grip on our future.\u201d The browser that BitTorent is working on will serve content without relying on a single node but instead distribute the data to an extensive network of computers in the world. This may be just the beginning of a decentralized web. Earlier in 2014, a similar but more ambitious project called, MaidSafe, which stands for \u201cMassive Array of Internet Disks, Secure Access For Everyone\u201d held a crowd sale for it\u2019s currency like tokens known as \u2018safecoins\u2019. The developers of MaidSafe who have been working on this project since the last seven years aims to create a decentralized peer to peer Internet platform which will also allow other developers to build applications in which all data is secure, private and protected from deletion. \u201cThe internet, our greatest tool of emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen.\u201d As Julian Assange points out, the future of Internet is at stake right now. In the future, when these projects come to fruition, maybe we\u2019ll be able to free the Web from the shackles of it\u2019s enemies.", "date": "2014-12-13T15:46:21+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 12, "day": 13}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/gaw-miners-scam/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Why GAW Miners is a scam", "content": "In simple terms GAW miners is a cloud mining company. It offers \u201chashlets\u201d which are digital cloud miners. They are available in 1 MH/s (Scrypt) or 10 GH/s (SHA256) slices and do not have an expiration date. They also sell hashstakers which is \u201cthe word\u2019s first cloud staking wallet\u201d. For coins using Proof of Share it allows for the staking of these coins in the cloud. Currently they are being investigated by the SEC for their questionable business model and their operations. First and foremost lets discuss what the hashlets actually are. Hashlets are simple ASIC miners just like the ones sold by the now bankrupt Butterfly Labs. On the website GAW miners advertises the hashlets for the following prices: Rememeber these are only available on the cloud and will not be shipped to you. They are also obviously out of stock because of the raging demand (cough cough). Furthermore, apparently you can buy them on Amazon except instead of the advertised $10/Mhs or $6.95/Mh you can get them for a whopping $109.99. For that price you can get 1.3Mhs of Scrypt mining power. But look! right next to it is our beloved Gridseed ASIC miner which offers 340 KH/s on Litecoin/Scrypt only, using just 5-7 watts of electric! So if you buy 5 Gridseeds you will be able to mine 5*340 = 1.7Mhs of scrypt mining which is a much better deal. Going back to our hashlets, at this point I am going to give GAW the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are just selling mining power coming from their mining warehouse. That is all good and dandy but the only problem is the business model does not make sense. Let us go over what is actually happening. Lets say that GAW miners has a warehouse running 100Mhs of Scrypt power. Now, GAW can either use it\u2019s mining power to mine on a multipool that mines the most profitable coin OR sell \u201chashlets\u201d to customers for a premium and make more than mining a random altcoin. The problem is that the mining network is so big that the profits are only slightly above the electricity cost, so mining is only profitable for large scale operations located in areas where electicity cost is below average. Those sheep that buy single hashlets will never make their ROI simply because the amount of mining power they rented is not enough to make profit before the next difficulty increase/ before the next generation ASIC comes out. GAW miners will trick you to buy hashlets and even give you free hahspoints or mining power in order to give you an illusion that you are making money from mining. I personally mined back in the day and even then I never broke ROI. The math might make sense now and will look like you are going to be generating massive ROI on your investment, but the truth of the matter is if it was as simple to make money as to buy a hashlet and let it sit there then everybody would do it. Let me be clear, I am NOT saying that mining is obsolete and is not profitable. There is a way to make money through mining but it requires risk and is a gamble. The most realistic way to make money from mining is to gamble on new altcoins and either mine then when they just come out on bitcointalk.org (altcoin section) OR gamble on already existing altcoins which have a feature coming up or are running a PR campaign. Customers should be aware of that risk before investing their coins into buying a virutal miner which will never break ROI if you use a simple multipool. Another great point made by a fellow redditor is the following: Next, Paycoin, oh lawd. Paycoin is just another altcoin, there is no real innovation its just branded by GAW miners to attract more buyers. I will not go in depth about all the false statements that Josh Garza has made because apparently his company\u2019s legal firm is taking action against anybody who says anything bad about GAW miners. Here is the letter sent to coinfire who wrote an article about Garza\u2019s false claims. Paycoin was launched by GAW miners with an ICO (initial coin offering) which is the first sign of an elaborate scam, those of you form bitcointalk.org know what I am talking about. Secondly, the currency was launched in order to make GAW\u2019s mining operation more profitable since now instead of mining random altcoins them and their customers can mine their own coin \u2013 Paycoin. It is only a matter of time before GAW miners trades paycoin to bitcoin and leaves it\u2019s customers with nothing. If you are looking for a cloud mining company do not waste your time with GAW miners, checkout leaserigs.net which offers better rates, freedom to use any mining pool you want, and a transparent operation where you can see that you are renting actual mining hardware from fellow miners. After all, bitcoin is a decentralized currency and cloud mining companies only make it more profitable to mine for the big centralized corporations, do you want another BFL or MtGox to taint bitcoin\u2019s reputation. Stay as far away from GAW miners as possible it is not worth the risk. Furhtermore, GAW miners also sell hashstakers which mine POS \u2013 proof of scam \u2013 oops I mean proof of share coins. Those apparently are the worlds first online staking wallet. That is simply ridiculous, you do not need any hardware to stake coins all you need is a staking wallet which all POS altcoins already have. It is ridiculous how they take advantage of unknowing customers. The above is my personal opinion which is protected under the first amendment, in the case that GAW miners tried to take down this post because it exposes their elaborate scam. For those of you in support of GAW miners I apologize for my no bullshit approach to their operation but I am sick and tired of all the scams which happen with cloud mining companies, somebody needs to step up and say enough!

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/multisig-transactions-can-fix-current-credit-cards-broken-consumer-protection-system/", "author": "Mark", "title": "How multisig transactions can fix the current Credit Cards\u2019 broken consumer protection system", "content": "Credit Cards were invented in the 1950s and were first used as plastic traveler\u2019s cheques. They were designed on extending credit to the consumer and allowing the merchant to collect or debit money from the consumer\u2019s account, whats known as a pull system. As credit card users, we have that notion that our transactions are \u201cprotected\u201d in the form of chargebacks. It is true that when a fraudulent transaction occurs on your credit card by someone that isn\u2019t you, a chargeback would resolve in your favor and reverse the funds. However, when it comes to more intricate fraud, like being overcharged in a restaurant, a chargeback might not resolve in your favor and you would loose out on your money. Furthermore, each credit card company has their own rules for chargebacks. If for example you have a VISA card and you want to use Mastercard\u2019s, or PayPal\u2019s conflict resolution system you are not able to do so. The system is broken because the \u201cescrow\u201d system is tied to the payment network. With bitcoin, we are able to use any escrow providers. For example we have the ability to use BitPay\u2019s or Coinbase\u2019s escrow system on any bitcoin transaction. There is no escrow system embedded on the network, when a transaction is sent it cannot be reversed. However, with the help of multisig, we are able to reintroduce consumer protection for bitcoin users. With blockchain technology, or programmable money we can create multisig transactions. I think the best way to explain what multisig transactions are in simple english is the way Andreas Antonopolous said: Multisig transactions allow us to create automated escrow, time based escrow, and even automated dispute resolution. These are just some of the examples how blockchain technology can help us achieve amazing new services that couldn\u2019t exist before. So, we are able to reintroduce consumer protection in a programmatic way, which makes it a much more powerful and flexible mechanism than the current credit cards\u2019 consumer protection system in place. Lastly, the introduction of multisig transactions creates a brand new open market for entrepreneurs to create multi-million dollar arbitration businesses. Let us say that you sell shoes on ebay. You ship your packages via UPS to your ebay customers and always receive a tracking number, which you enter into Ebay\u2019s website. If you are a new seller, the current Ebay\u2019s \u201cescrow\u201d system in place usually releases the funds 3 days after the tracking shows as confirmed. Now, lets say that a customer files a dispute for an undelivered item. Because Ebay is tied to PayPal the buyer has 30-60 days to file a chargeback. If a customer files a dispute Ebay will start an investigation. During this investigation Ebay would look at the tracking number and if it shows the item as delivered it would most likely deny the customer\u2019s dispute (in a perfect scenario of course). If the tracking shows as undelivered, then Ebay would reverse the funds and return the funds to the buyer. That is a great process, but how long do you think that takes? Ebay disputes can take at least 7-10 days. The current system in place is not scalable because it is inefficient. With multisig technology we can introduce a business that creates a multisig transaction with 3 required keys, the buyer, the merchant, and itself. The company would then automatically look up UPS\u2019s tracking number and once it shows as delivered would automatically sign the transaction with their keys and release the coins to the merchant. Thus, we have eliminated unnecessary human labor and introduced a more efficient programmatical way to perform escrow with multisig transactions.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/poorly-generated-addresses-cause-blockchain-info-customers-btc-loss/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Poorly generated addresses cause Blockchain.info customer\u2019s BTC loss", "content": "Blockchain.info seems to be under much heat lately from all the recent attacks. Ranging from https redirection by rogue Tor nodes to phishing attempts. During a scheduled update by the blockchain.info team an issue was present between 12:00am and 2:30am GMT on 12/8/14. According to the official blockchainwallet reddit account: What was the issue? How were the coins stolen? We are here to find out. A bitcoin transaction has inputs and outputs. It looks like this: Here is a brief overview of what an input and an output in a transaction consits of (taken from the bitcoin wiki) An input is a reference to an output in a different transaction. Multiple inputs are often listed in a transaction. The values of the referenced outputs are added up, and the total is usable in the outputs of this transaction. Previous tx is a hash of a previous transaction. Index is the specific output in the referenced transaction. ScriptSig is the first half of a script. The script contains two components, a signature and a public key. An output contains instructions for sending bitcoins. Value is the number of Satoshi (1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshi) that this output will be worth when claimed. ScriptPubKey is the second half of a script (discussed later). There can be more than one output, and they share the combined value of the inputs. A script is essentially a list of instructions recorded with each transaction that describe how the next person wanting to spend the Bitcoins being transferred can gain access to them. It contains a signature and a public key. According to Nils Schneider on 12/25/13 he discovered a potential weakness in some Bitcoin implementations. He gave an example of a transactions: The above is an example of a transaction with 2 inputs. If you look closely you can see how the script has many similar bytes at the beginning and at the end. Since the beginning of the script is the signature (r,s) r1 = r2 This is where the repeating R values come from. Because the r values are equal Schneider was able to find a way to recover the private key to that public key which he shows in his blog post.

It differs because it is backed by the GEMS social messaging app. Furthermore, you do not have to own any gems in order to use the app, you can use bitcoin as well. This makes it a unique altcoin and a unique social messaging app, together combined you get GEMS Gems, a social network which uses Bitcoin, recently ended its public sale of tokens at invite-only prices on the 3rd of December 2014. It raised an astounding $111,000 in the two weeks in which the sale was open. This means that roughly 5 Million XGEMS were sold during that time, at the rate of about 17,250 XGEMS per Bitcoin. This was also the first crowd sale to be held at Koinify, the app dev platform which raised about a million dollars. This crowd sale is being dubbed as one of the best responses from the Bitcoin community to launch a feasible crowd funding platform. Now that the early bird period has ended, which it did at 8:00 BST, the price of the tokens has increased to 15000 per Bitcoin. The crowd sale received a very welcome response as more than 10% of the tokens were sold, and more than 700 Koinify wallets were created. But of course, credit has to be given to both Gems and Koinify, as they did whatever was possible so that customers could have a very smooth, user-friendly experience while both, creating wallets and of course, purchasing tokens. And also, they not only managed the software side well, they also managed to advertise their services, considering they flew all the way to San Francisco and other places so as to do so. Unfortunately, the founder of Dogecoin, Jackson Palmer, took it to himself to promote buyers away from this sale on Twitter. To this, the companies tried to promote their transparency of this event, saying that they have not hidden anything and will not do so anytime. Considering the reaction to the sale, the interest in this offering is noteworthy, since there has been a decline in the rate of interest of ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and this one has received such a huge response nonetheless. Koinify has recently reported that so far, more than 300 unique users have participated in the sale; unique users signifying unique Bitcoin addresses provided by each customer. Koinify also expected last minute buys to be greater than the current number of the press time. They explained this with an example of the new altcoin type-thing, Ethereum, which uses crypto 2.0 platform: 90% of the buys were last minute buys. Gems lead dev Daniel Peled also said that people want really good offer, and they keep watching for that. Since many of the best offers come around the corner in the last minute, one can always expect the end of the sale to finish with a big boom. Gems tokens will give incentive to the customers, by enabling them to earn profits by using the said social network. Also, it is worth knowing that a Hangout on the same sale took place on 4:00 BST. Overall, Gems had a pretty good sale time, getting a good response from the crypto currency group, although the Dogecoin founder rebelling was a minor disturbance. It is safe to say that their crowdsale went well.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitlicense-overview/", "author": "danish javed", "title": "BitLicense: An Overview", "content": "The year 2014 has turned out to be the year where almost everyone has hopped on the Bitcoin bandwagon. Bitcoin start ups have sprouted out from all corners of the world, tacking a range of crypto-currency services. But, as Bitcoin slowly seeps into the mainstream, bitcoin businesses everywhere have been demanding regulatory clarity from legislators and industry governing bodies. Earlier this year, in July, the New York Department of Financial Services released a proposed regulation for Bitcoin companies. The proposed regulatory framework called \u201cBitLicense\u201d was submitted for a 45-day notice and comment period to solicit public feedback. The draft proposal was first of it\u2019s kind as there had been no comprehensive list of regulations by another government entity. The bitcoin community has embraced this process as a milestone for Bitcoin. A consesus of opinion among the early Bitcoin adopters revealed that there was a dire need of laws along with regulatory clairty which would offer consumer protection, financial transparency of the businesses involved in order to prevent another Mt. Gox like event in the future. Being the hub of the financial world, there were high expectations from New York. Ben Lawksy, the Superintendent of the DFS, announced the proposal on Bitcoin subreddit, which is along with BitcoinTalk forums the most active bitcoin discussion on the Internet. The Bitcoin community in general appreciated this approach and the effort to make collaboration happen. After a period of long discourse, almost everyone involved in the Bitcoin industry concluded that it would be almost impossible to comply with the regulatory framework as suggested in the draft proposal. Thus, starts the due diligence period. Why did BitLicense face significant backlash from the Bitcoin community? Let\u2019s look at the summarized version of the proposal submitted by redditors! Holders of BitLicense\u2019s will be required to: Comply with the new regulations and register with the state within 45 days. Background check required for all employees/founders.Fingerprints of the above submitted to FBI. Requires a bond held with New York State. Requires written approval of all new business activities/offerings. Requires that you keep 10 years of records of business transactions. Virtual currency accounts not active for 5 years must be handed over to the state. Retained earnings and profits of the company can ONLY be invested in US dollars: Federal bonds, state bonds, or money market funds. Mandatory reviews every 2 years: financial condition, safety/soundness of business, policies\u2026 Quarterly financial statements required within 45 days of the closing of each quarter. Financial statements must be audited, use GAAP. Typical AML/KYC requirements. Cybersecurity requirement: requires security officer, security plan, audits, backup plan. In marketing/advertising, you must include \u201cLicensed to engage in Virtual Currency Business Activity by the New York State Department of Financial Services.\u201d Must disclose a long list of material risks with dealing with virtual currency: e.g., \u201cnot legal tender, backed by any government\u201d Criticism What seemed to be the vital criticism regarding BitLicense by majority of Bitcoin advocates and enthusiasts was that the underlined proposals in the regulation were unpractical and in reality not enforceable. They also went further and commented that NYDFS is deliberately raising the bar to stifle innovation and eliminate the small players by raising high barriers to enter. This response from the Bitcoin community was stronger than anticipated. Eventually, NYDFS superintendent Benjamin M Lawsky due to public interest would extend the comment period for the BitLicense proposal by an additional 45 days. On October 15, Ben Lawsky, while speaking at the Benjamin N Cardozo School of Law, New York made a public statement. He said: \u201cTo clarify, we do not intend to regulate software or software development. For example, a software developer who creates and provides wallet software to customers for their own use will not need a license. Those who are innovating and developing the latest platforms for digital currencies will not need a license.\u201d On October 21st, the 90 day comment period came to an end by the final comments submitted by Circle and BitPay \u2013 arguably the most influential players in the Bitcoin industry. Both of these Bitcoin based startups shared a similar sentiment which indicated that: \u201cAt the very least, we encourage the NYDFS to develop a regulatory framework that maintains a level playing field by establishing similar guidelines for both digital currency firms and other money transmitters. There are several areas in the proposed rule that go well beyond what is required for other money transmitters.\u201d On October 28th, participants involved in the crytpo 2.0 technologies like Counterparty and Mastercoin denied false claims regarding their crackdown by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Following this event, Ben Lawsky was asked if the second generation of non-currency applications utilizing the blockchain would come under the regulations proposed in the Bitlicense. The response was straightforward \u2013 BitLicense was not designed to cover these new generation projects. Just about three days ago, NYDFS had publicly release 3,700 comments that it had receive regarding it\u2019s BitLicense proposal. Some of the largest organizations in the US have been proactively involved with this process. Amazon, Walmart and Western Union being prime examples among others. This move from these giants indicated that there\u2019s a dire need for regulatory clarity regarding Bitcoin. Conclusion Thanks to the increasing resistance by the bitcoin community against the initial BitLicense proposal, the last five months of painstaking efforts serves as evidence that lawmakers are willing to work together if there is enough pressure by it\u2019s supporters. BitLicense still hasn\u2019t gone through anywhere near it\u2019s last draft and yet so much has already happened. We\u2019ll follow on the updates as they are revealed to us.", "date": "2014-12-06T04:47:03+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 12, "day": 6}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/freshcoin-setting-bar-cryptocurrency/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Freshcoin \u2013 setting the bar in cryptocurrency", "content": "Freshcoin is a brand new cryptocurrency which was launched on 7/7/2014 18:00 GMT. It features a brand new algorithm called FRESH, uses on POW to confirm transactions, and a new difficulty adjustment algorithm \u2013 Slingshield. What is FRESH? It is a new algorithm which combines SHAVITE, SIMD & ECHO which are the 3 most energy efficient hashing algorithms. The result is an algorithm which uses 15% \u2013 20% less energy than the X11/X13/X15 family of algorithms. In order to keep ASIC miners away FRESH utilizes 5 rounds of these 3 algorithms. It keeps ASICs away because passing the result of one sub algorithm to another need many logic gates on the circuit, this complicates and raises the price to produce a compatible ASIC. For increased protection, FRESH uses Digishield Slingshield to increase the hashrate required for a 51% attack to 71%. That means that double spend attacks are not as likely to happen and are harder to execute. In addition to the hashing algorithms, FRESH comes with Slingshield \u2013 a difficulty adjustment algorithm. Accoridng to the official bitcointalk thread here is how Slingshield works: So the block reward falls dramatically after the first 7 days when Slingshield kicks in. Here is a look at the block reward system: As you can see the block reward falls from 10000 to 10 which is quite a dramatic fall. Eventually the block reward completely disappears and that is when only transaction fees will feed the miners. This coin decided to not implement a POS phase. As we have seen recently POS does not seem to be very reliable. Stealthcoin forked multiple times in the POW -> POS transition, Mintpal was hacked and Vericoin ( a POS coin) had to hardfork to revert the damage, and now Navajocoin has been attacked in a double spend attack in its POS phase. So far we can see that POS is unreliable, causes forks, and is vulnerable. Maybe the POS implementation is bad and the altcoins who are cloning other coins for their POS system are only digging themselves into a deeper hole. Either way, the developer of Freshcoin decided that instead of a POS phase, the coin will use the Slingshield algorithm to build the backbone of it\u2019s blockchain. Freshcoin has it\u2019s own miner which can be downloaded from here: http://www.freshcoin.net/files/sph_sgminer_fresh.zip (AMD GPU)http://www.freshcoin.net/files/fresh_ccminer.zip (NVIDIA GPU)http://www.freshcoin.net/files/minderd_fresh.zip (CPU x64) You have the option of using an AMD GPU, NVIDIA GPU, or a 61 bit CPU. I am using AMD R9 290 Tri-x to mine Freshcoin and with these settings I am able to pull 3.6 Mhs per card. \u201cintensity\u201d : \u201c18\u201d, \u201cworksize\u201d : \u201c256\u201d, \u201ckernel\u201d : \u201cfresh\u201d, \u201clookup-gap\u201d : \u201c2\u201d, \u201cthread-concurrency\u201d : \u201c8192\u201d, \u201cgpu-threads\u201d : \u201c4\u201d, \u201cgpu-engine\u201d : \u201c0-0\u201d, \u201cgpu-fan\u201d : \u201c0-0\u201d, \u201cgpu-memclock\u201d : \u201c0\u201d, \u201cgpu-memdiff\u201d : \u201c0\u201d, \u201cgpu-powertune\u201d : \u201c0\u201d, \u201cgpu-vddc\u201d : \u201c0.000\u201d, \u201ctemp-cutoff\u201d : \u201c95\u201d, \u201ctemp-overheat\u201d : \u201c85\u201d, \u201ctemp-target\u201d : \u201c75\u201d, \u201capi-mcast-port\u201d : \u201c4028\u201d, \u201capi-port\u201d : \u201c4028\u201d, \u201cexpiry\u201d : \u201c28\u201d, \u201cfailover-switch-delay\u201d : \u201c60\u201d, \u201cgpu-dyninterval\u201d : \u201c7\u201d, \u201cgpu-platform\u201d : \u201c0\u201d, \u201clog\u201d : \u201c5\u201d, \u201cno-pool-disable\u201d : true, \u201cqueue\u201d : \u201c1\u201d, \u201cscan-time\u201d : \u201c7\u201d, \u201ctcp-keepalive\u201d : \u201c30\u201d, \u201ctemp-hysteresis\u201d : \u201c3\u201d, \u201cshares\u201d : \u201c0\u201d, \u201ckernel-path\u201d : \u201c/usr/local/bin\u201d You can use any of the mining pools below: The developer of Freshcoin is working on new features which are described in the following whitepaper. The feature being developed is an app which will enable anybody with a mobile phone and some freshcoins to send another person his coins. He can use facebook messenger, SMS, WhatsApp, or Email. Here is how it works: 1) A new Private Key is generated by the client. 2) The Private Key is sent in a message with a claim link. 3) Upon claiming the private key will be handled by the FRESH online system 4) A Copy of the private key is kept in the senders wallet so they can reverse the payment at anytime (until claimed). FRSH is currently trading on Bittrex, Bter, c-cex, and rapidcx. The volume is currently rising on Bittrex, lets take a look at the current market: As you can see we have been seeing quite a dump in the last few hours, but why? Since the block reward has just decreased by 100 times all the people who mined Freshcoin will not longer mine it since it is way less profitable. As a result, the miners who mined FRSH are starting to dump the coin to cash out. Since we have never seen such a dramatic decrease in block reward form a coin we have never encountered this scenario. Maybe since the block reward was so high it will create high sell volume and will keep pushing the price down. However, that will last only for a short period of time until all the miners who mined during the first 7 days cash out. Now that the block reward is 10 this is when the price will start to rise and stabilize. It is not safe to buy as of right now but some of you risky investors might have some fun trying to catch the bottom and score some cheap freshcoins.

Many report that their accounts have been hacked into and their coins withdrawn. What caused the recent spike in account breaches at blockchain.info? According to the blockchain PR account blockchainwallet on reddit, the top 3 issues concerning their security are: Having a strong password with many different characters is a no brainer and I hope most of you are using different passwords for different accounts. Phishing attacks can be avoided by accessing blockchain.info by typing it\u2019s address in the url bar in your browser. We reported previously about a phishing site for blockchain.info which appeared at the top of the front page on google because of a google adword campaign. That attack wasn\u2019t very successfull because redditors brought it to google\u2019s attention prompty and the phishing site got taken down. Lastly, the most recent security issue which caused massive btc losses for customer funds was due to malicious Tor nodes. The attack was a simple and archaic MITM (man in the middle) attack. In simple terms the exit node does not know where the traffic originates from (the TOR user) but it can intercept the traffic if it is not encrypted. So, when someone accessed blockchain.info the rogue exit node would record the data being send and extract a victims wallet ID and the password. The catch here is that blockchain and many other sites that have the user send sensitive account information encrypt their traffic using SSL. So even if somebody was looking at the packets exchanged the information would be encrypted and the attacker would not be able to get the password. Well, the rogue exit node was able to strip the SSL from blockchain.info. Those who noticed in the upper left corner would see that they are connecting to a http:// version of the site. When not using https:// protocol the information is not encrypted and thus you can fall victim to a MITM attack. Now, if you try to connect to blockchain.info using tor you will get the above message. Blockchain has made a .onion mirror which ensure the integrity and encryption of traffic. Furthermore, it looks like they fixed a bug where you could connect to a SSL stripped version of the site, which is yet another preventative measure to a MITM vulnerability. Blockchain.info uses something that is called HSTS. What it does is force all your request to go through https if you ever accessed the site with https before. Now, when somebody accesses blockchain by typing http:// then the HSTS header is not sent to force those https connections, and the tor browser bundle by default will not save the HSTS header either. That leaves rogue exit nodes free to start doing redirects. What blockchain could do is set a static page for any incoming http connection and tell the user to reconnect using https that way the HSTS header would be set and the user would end up accessing the site over a secure, encrypted connection. Overall blockchain.info is a reliable and competent wallet service which was able to identify and solve a problem it had no obligation to solve. I recommend this wallet service to anyone new to bitcoin. Their mobile app is extremely slick and responsive and makes it simple to send and receive coins.

The all popular bitcoin exchange Cryptsy has been found to have a bug related to it\u2019s trading engine. The bug has been pointed out on reddit by prohashing, which is an altcoin mining pool. They are a multipool which allows the mining of any coin. In short, prohashing is able to pay out users in bitcoin by selling the altcoins on exchanges using an automated bot. Prohashing decided to use Cryptsy\u2019s API to facilitate the automated trading of the altcoins. However, on Wednesday, November 19 Megacoin\u2019s order book containes a phatom sell order which was listed far below the lowest bid. Here is a picture of the mysterious order: As a result, any person or algorithm that attempted to trade Megacoin saw that the price of Megacoins was 0.00000007, since it was the lowest price. Throughout the day, the price should have been at that low level because people were trading against that price. They were being charged the price that the graph actually showed, which was higher. When Cryptsy fixed the bug to allow the sell order to be filled, orders were able to be filled at the low price, so there was a brief crash. Then the market returned to normal when the sell order was filled. Unfortunately Cryptsy did not handle the situation as well as we would hope. Prohashing (the mining pool affected by the bug) posted a complaint on reddit in regards to this issue. They stated that Cryptsy\u2019s staff acknowledged the error and fixed the order after being notified of the issue. However, prohashing and no other customers have been reimbursed for that loss. Cryptsy\u2019s Customer Service Manager Jim aka: JShock replied with: The problem here is that no 3rd party software was used. Prohashing used Cryptsy\u2019s own API to perform the auto trading so the fault lies completely on Cryptsy\u2019s software.

There are about now 100,000 to 200,000 merchants who accept bitcoins as a mode of payment. In comparison to last year, this is great progress, but what about the emerging alt coins? Out of those 200,000 merchants, not a lot of them even accept Litecoin or Dogecoin \u2013 let alone hundreds of other alt coins. Here comes CoinGateway, a nifty solution to fill the gap. CoinGateway was launched in the summer of 2014 to enable the purchase of products and services from retailers that accept bitcoin through the use of an altcoin. When they started off, the list of accepting alt-coins was small, but they keep adding new coins as they go. These coins are Dogecoin, Xcurrency, Litecoin, PotCoin, SysCoin, LibrexCoin, UtilityCoin, Fibrecoin among others. The founders of the start up CoinGateway solved the problem of spending alt coins at the right time and ever since their inception, they have seen a rise in volume and a growing user base. Well, how do you go about spending an alt coin at a place where Bitcoin is accepted? The entire process is streamlined and very easy to execute for the end user. It\u2019s a single-page website to provide a more fluid user-experience. There are three ways to go about conducting a transaction on CoinGateway \u2013 Spend, Exchange and Fiat. As you can see, most of these options are pretty self-explanatory. Spend \u2013 Exchange your alt coin for Bitcoin. Exchange \u2013 Convert your Bitcoin for an alt coin. Fiat \u2013 Exchange your Bitcoin for Dollars. When a user is given a Bitcoin address and the amount at the checkout page of the merchant, in order to complete the payment, they need to choose their desired alt-coin, enter the Bitcoin amount and address, and that\u2019s pretty much it. The Bitcoin will be sent to the recipients address after converting the alt-coin at a current market rate on it\u2019s largest exchange. They charge a 0.5% fees on every transaction. Customer\u2019s response CoinGateway\u2019s service has been generally receiving good reviews from the users on social media. \u201c@Coingateway excellent service. This is what a modern startup looks like: good reviews, respect for privacy and prompt service.\u201d Several users have applauded their efforts on Reddit by giving them a huge credit for their customer support. \u201cFor whatever the recommendation of an anonymous Reddit user is worth, I\u2019d have to say Coingateway did a decent job handling my screwup. No complaints.\u201d From the outlook of the progress of CoinGateway, it seems that they are here for the long run. This becomes evident when they held an ITO for BlockNet last month in October. The ITO, when it ended, was considered to be an overall success by several participants involved, including the BlockNet team. To summarize, CoinGateway definitely brings something new to the table. There was a demand for an instant, simple and cheap conversion of cryptocurrencies and they seem to have fulfilled it.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/shieldcoin-shld-vs-stealthcoin-xst/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Shieldcoin SHLD vs Stealthcoin XST", "content": "Lets look at the main differences between Shieldcoin and Stealthcoin. The first one is that Stealthcoin runs under the X13 algorithm and Shieldcoin runs under X15. You may have been hearing about these new X11, X13, X15 algorithms and alot of people ask what they are about. These new and profitable algorithms are the big shots in the GPU mining world and were created specifically for GPU mining. So unlike Scrypt, Scrypt-N, and Scrypt-Jane which supposedly prevent ASICs by using up large amounts of memory, these new X algorithms are designed in such a way that each sub-algorithm result is passed into the next sub-algorithm. We believe that making an ASIC for this would be very difficult because the hardware would require logic gates for each algorithm. So when there are many sub algorithms (11, 13, 15) it is makes the production of a feasible ASIC much harder. So now that we established that the next big trend is these X algorithms which one is better? The X11, X13, or X15? The X11 algorithm uses 11 hash functions from the Blake algorithm to the Keccak algorithm, which makes it very secure. Like we said earlier the result of one sub-algorithm is passed into the other. So in X11 the result of the hashing function of the Blake algorithm is passed onto the Keccak algorithm, and that is done 11 times. Pretty secure right. Now guess what X13 does, it doubles it. X13 adapts and improves X11 by adding two more cryptographic algo\u2019s hamsi and fugue. Okay now we are getting somewhere. This X13 algorithm is used with Stealthcoin, so in a way it utilizes 4 different algorithms to pass around the result. Okay so we have gone a long way from a simple Sha-256 or Scrypt algorithm. Now we have X13 which is a 4 in 1 type algo. Of course that was not enough, here comes X15. X15 is the latest algorithm ,15 ROUNDS OF SCIENTIFIC HASHING (blake, bmw, groestl, jh, keccak, skein, luffa, cubehash, shavite, simd, echo, hamsi, fugue, shabal, whirlpool). There you have it, the almighty X15, the backbone of Shieldcoin. Some may say it is overkill some may say it is evolution but both X13 and X15 are secure and efficient algorithms, yes X15 is newer but there is nothing wrong with X13. But since we are comparing Shieldcoin and Stealthcoin I have to give this one to Shieldcoin because X15 is after all an algorithm with added security. The next thing to look at is what type of mining the coin has and whether they feature a proof of stake stage. The importance of a proof of stake stage is to allow an incentive for investors and enthusiasts to hold their coins. The trend nowadays is to include both a POW and a POS stage. In that case once the coins have been mined they will increase in value simply by holding them AND having your computer be online. The way POS works is by selecting a random node to be the \u201cminer\u201d and process a transaction that way. So by simply having your wallet online the amount of coins in your wallet increases. Both Shieldcoin and Stealthcoin offer and POW and POS stage. However Stealthcoin did have recent issues with a fork which happened when the POS stage came along. The dev team is still working out the issues but my guess as to what happened was that the dev forgot to set seed nodes for the POS stage. So when POS did kick in the protocol had to choose its own random seed node which ended up causing many forks, not just one. So in essence what happened was bittrex was on one fork, while the official mining pool was on another fork, and your wallet was probably on another fork. As a result Bittrex disabled the BTC-XST market untill the issues get resolved. The most important thing here is not to panic, if you had stealthcoins in any of your wallets make sure to put them offline. Then wait until the dev syncs up the blockchain and simply sync up your wallet to the blockchain, the coins are still going to be there. Just remember when the bittrex market comes up it will probably dump, but that should be only temporary. On the other hand, Shieldcoin had moved to the POS stage with no problems and is rising on bittrex, transactions are having no problems so once again Shieldcoin has to win this one. Lastly what makes a great coins is it\u2019s developers. So far we have seen no issues with Shieldcoin but does that mean it\u2019s developers are better then Stealthcoin\u2019s? Stealthcoin ran into an unprecedented issue and it is up for the developers to fix it ASAP. Would shieldcoin devs be able to handle such a problem? Since both coins only recently launched it is hard to tell. I would also like to mention that Stealthcoin integrates tor into its network and uses tor to anonymize the nodes. That is a feature that Shieldcoin does not have and is unique to stealthcoin.I am not going to compare details such as block rewards, premines, block times, total coins, coin maturity, etc. because nobody knows what the perfect combination of these works best. There are so many feasible combinations of these specs that they almost seem irrelevant. Overall from what we have seen based on the two criteria that I compared Shieldcoin and Stealthcoin above I conclude that Shieldcoin is the better choice. I do not want to put Stealthcoin down because the fact that it runs over tor is unique, but until the developers fix the fork its hard to tell Stealthcoin\u2019s fate. Back when Darkcoin had a fork it took the devs 8 hours to fix it. So i the Stealthcoin devs can fix the issue faster then Darkcoin devs then Stealthcoin still stands a chance. Only time will tell.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/navajocoin-introducing-anon-transfers-using-subchains/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Navajocoin \u2013 introducing anon transactions using subchains", "content": "Navajocoin is a X13 based cryptocurrency featuring a POW and POS stage. It evolved from Summercoin V2 which was launched in May 2014. As the developer was working on a new feature called the Navajo Anonymous Technology the rebranding came along which transformed SUM2 to NAV Let us briefly go over how Navajocoin was created. It isn\u2019t a new gimmicky shitcoin with an anon dev. It is a coin that evolved from Summercoin which was released back in April of 2014. SUM was a trendy crypto which featured the all new (at the time) X11 algo , a Proof of Stake stage, and was considered to be the first season coin. However, the coin ran into some issues especially with the staking algorithm. Following what most developers of shitcoins do, the original dev of Summercoin bailed and a new developer took over. That dev team decided to dump SUM and start a new version called Summercoin V2. This coin featured the newer X13 algorithm in addition to the sought after POS stage. During the transition holders of SUM were able to convert their assets to SUM2 at a 1:1 ratio. So once the conversion has taken place the dev announced that they were working on a new project called the Navajo Anonymous Technology. This lead to a rebranding of SUM2 to the all new Navajocoin. Navajocoin features the latest X13 algorithm which adapts X11 and adds 2 more hashing algos hamsi and fugue. It is not as modern as the X15 algorithm which features 15 rounds of scientific hashing, but it is not neccesary to have that many hashing algorithms so X15 may simply be overkill. It also offers the trendy POW/POS stages. If you did not know a POW (proof of work) is the normal mining stage just like bitcoin where miner\u2019s earn coins by solving blocks and processing transactions. With POS Proof of Stake, the resource that\u2019s compared is the amount of Bitcoin a miner holds \u2013 someone holding 1% of the Bitcoin can mine 1% of the \u201cProof of Stake blocks\u201d. Here is how Navajocoin\u2019s POW and POS stages work, referenced from bitcointalk.org: POW (Ended): Total Coins (by POW): 50,000,000 Difficulty Retarget: From block 0 to 250: each 25 blocks, From block 251 on, adjust each block POW Max Block Height: 14000 (7 days POW only before POS starts along) Block Reward: 1500 Block Halving: 14,000 Blocks (Reward: 150 Coins) , Block 50,000 (Reward 15 Coins) , Block 100,000 (End of POW) POS: Min age: 4 days Max age: unlimited Minted Blocks Maturity: 60 Stake Interest: First Year: 20% Second Year: 10% Third Year + nYears: 5% As you can see the POW stage of this coin was pretty short \u2013 only 7 days. As of now the coin is in pure POS stage, which means you earn 20% stake interest for the first year. If you did not know here is how POS mining works: Each block (every 30 seconds), a random Navajocoin is selected to be the next \u201cminer\u201d. There are 50 million coins so the odds of a single wallet being selected is the number of NAV in that wallet divided by 50 million. (Also, it\u2019s possible to calculate and agree on who that node is so the transactions need only be sent to that particular wallet.) If a node with the selected wallet is running, it will collect the transactions, make a block, and send it to the rest of the network and collect the fees. If the computer is turned off, however, then the entire network will have to select a different navajocoin to make the transaction. This time, the unresponsive wallet will be ignored. The network would suffer in that the time to make a block is decreased, but the thought is that people wouldn\u2019t leave their computers off if they have a lot of NAV because they\u2019re missing out on all the fees that they could have collected. If you only have a few NAV, you can leave your computer off: You probably wouldn\u2019t have collected much fees anyway. If you are holding a lot of NAV and would like to make profit on your holdings then you should consider transferring the NAV to your wallet (if it is not already there) so you can enjoy POS earnings. You also have the option of using the chunky pool in order to mine Navajocoin/Summercoin. Essentially you would direct your hashes to a specified url using either SHA-256, Scrypt, or X11, and the pool would convert the mined coins into NAV. Here is a statement form chunkypools: So if you have extra hashes in SHA256, Scrypt, or X11 and would like to invest into NAV you should consider using chunky pools. The dev team released a whitepaper which described their plans for the anonymous transfer system that is going into beta testing on July 14th. In their whitepaper they mention Optional Decentralized Anonymity in cryptocurrency which is a feat yet to be achieved. We have seen Stealthcoin using tor nodes, Shieldcoin who\u2019s dev also released a whitepaper regarding anon transactions, all hopping onto the ODA train in the race to a successful implementation of anon transactions. According to the Navajocoin whitepaper: Let us take a look at how these subchains work and what the dev team is proposing. The idea here is to use Subchains in order to make the inputs and outputs of a transaction in such a manner that neither the recepient nor the sender can be corrolated, linked to each other, or even traced back on the blockchain. Here is a brief infogram taken from the official whitepaper: Above, the blue arrow shows the regular unencrypted transaction which gets broadcasted on the network and all the information gets stored on the blockchain just like with bitcoin. The red arrow shows the anonymous transaction which begins with the sender choosing a specific node to channel the transaction through, this begins the anonymous transaction phase. The selected node is the gateway to the subchain because from hereon it will set the destination to the next stage forming a \u201cchain\u201d. The selected node will send the transaction through 2 gateways. first the Navajo \u201cMagic\u201d Gateway takes the information then uses double encryption to send it to the Choctaw \u201cStar\u201d Gate, which then forwards the transaction to a Destination Initialization Mechanism. The NMG and the CSG are the two main players in facilitating an anonymous transaction. The Navajo \u201cMagic\u201d Gateway received the encrypted transaction infowhich includes the destination address and the amount. It decrypts it and then sends it off to the CSG which in turns verifies its integrity before broadcasting the transaction on the main chain. So what appears on the main blockchain is only the destination address and the amount. The reason is because the only part of the transaction the is being broadcasted on the main network is the one going from the CSG to the receiver. Since the only information the anonymizing node relays to the NMG is the destination address and the amount that is the only information that is available to the CSG which is responsible for broadcasing the transaction on the main network. So, in turn the anonymous transaction cannot be traced using the blockchain because there is not enough information about it. It cannot be traced via the sub chains either because all data transfer is encrypted and the players responsible for the encrypted data transfer are decentralized. Furthermore, in order to counter other attacks of tracing similar amounts and linking senders and receivers Navajocoin cam up with the idea to introduce a random variable fee AND an option to split the sent amount among several different addresses. Efficiency also plays a role in the system. Since it only takes 3 confirmations for the coins to be sent and received using the anonymous transactions there is no disadvantage to use this feature. Because the anonymizing feature uses subchains it does not bloat the backbone of the system. Some may say that Navajocoin\u2019s anonymous transaction implementation is similar to Darkcoin\u2019s Darksend feature. However, Darksend does not feature subchains or double encryption and their decentralized nodes are essentially pools. Here is how Darksend works. DarkSend uses a pool of transactions, currently POOL_MAX_TRANSACTIONS is set to 3. This means it will wait for 3 transactions before \u201cdarksending\u201d them. Being that you can only send 1 transaction through the pool at a time, you will need to wait for someone else on the network to send another darksend transaction. If you don\u2019t want to wait, you can send multiple darksend transactions with multiple clients. The way Darksend is setup is it still uses the public ledger to broadcast the transaction but it obfuscates the source by having a decentralized node. It does not have an equivalent to a NMG and a CSG. Another feature that the Navajo Anonymous technology is going to introduce is a decentralized messaging system. It will allow users to chat right from the Navajocoin wallet. The messaging system will use subchains to transmit the messages so once again the backbone of the network will not be affected. The on Wallet Messaging service will tie nicknames to addresses. An available balance will be required to chat in order to prevent spam because it is a decentralized network after all. To combat spammers the devs decided to implement a mute feature where a node will be able to sop listening to a certain nickname for a specific period of time. Navajocoin is currently trading on Bittrex, Poloniex, and Bter. As we can see Nav has been rising steadily on Bittrex. The release of the beta-testing on July 14th should pump the price even higher and unless something goes wrong and the beta release fails. Hopefully NAV will keep rising after the 14th unless it pulls a Shieldcoin type move. The volume on NAV-BTC is also rising which is obviously a good sign. Keep an eye out for this coin because after all it has gone through a successful POW stage and made a smooth transition unlike Stealthcoin \u2013 which forked multiple times upon the arrival of the POS stage because the dev forgot to set seed nodes. Hopefully this time the dev did not copy paste code like Shieldcoin\u2019s dev then NAV should reach lunar levels.

We last saw what happened when vertcoin introduced stealth addresses. It caused a spike in market price because anonymous transactions/wallets is a feature that is highly in demand. On the Announcement page for Shieldcoin on Bitcointalk the dev posted a message saying: This is the hype that is partially causing shieldcoin to go up. We have also seen stealthcoin on the rise however due to multiple forks in its blockchain bittrex had to halt the market. The developers are currently working on the forks and should release a statement soon. Stealthcoin became popular because of it\u2019s integration with the tor network, each node runs over tor and it gives it that extra anonymity. So here we have 2 coins one of which runs over the tor network and the other claims to have anonymous transactions developed. Maybe the next big thing is a coin that runs over tor with anonymous transactions in place. That could be stealthcoin, or shieldcoin, or another coin that wins the race to a truly anonymous cryptocurrency.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/vertcoin-introducing-stealth-addresses/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Vertcoin introducing stealth addresses", "content": "As you may have already heard vertcoin (VTC) is a virutal currency that is based on the Scrypt-N (N factor Scrypt) algorithm. The average confirmation time is 2.43 minutes which is very similar to that of litecoin. While the mining algorithm might sound very similar to the one of Litecoin it is in fact very different. Scrypt-N means that once every couple years the N factor which regulates memroy requirements will double. This means that if equipment would be developed to mine the Scrypt-N algorith at N = 10, then when N increases the equipment will be rendered useless. This is essentially the idea of how vertcoin is ASIC resistant unlike litecoin whose Scrypt algorithm always requires the same amount of memory. If the above was too complicated then check out what wow-doge\u2018s analogy of the Scrypt-N alogirthm from reddit: Here are the VTC statistics taken from cryptocoinsinfo: Stealth addresses allow payees to publish a single, fixed address that payors can use to send funds privately and non-interactively. The announcement of stealth addresses came on reddit, here is what the developer said: All the transactions are still on the blockchain to be seen, but the link between an address and an individual is obfuscated. One thing that not many people seem to consider when talking about anonymity systems in cryptocurrencies is that true anonymous payments make all the blockchain tools you\u2019re used to useless. In essence, the sender and the receiver are the only people that know each other\u2019s address. On the blockchain it does not show that vertcoins have been transferred from one address to another because both addresses are obfuscated. For a tutorial on how to use stealth addresses as a merchant or as a buyer click HERE. As the announcement for the addition of the stealth address rolled in the price of vertcoin has jumped over %84 in 24 hours on cryptsy. Here is a quick look at the market, currently as of 7/2/14 1 VTC = 0.00071 BTC As you can see vertcoin has been on quite a downtrend lately just like all the other altcoins.

It started on July 5th as you can see from the chart below taken from bitcoinwisdom As we can see there is a pattern with the buy volume for OKCoin.

Litecoins has seemed to decouple from bitcoin and looked like it was dying for quite some time. However, since July 5th we have been seeing continuous buy volume form OKcoin. One theory as to why the pump might be happening is because Litecoin is following into Bitcoin\u2019s footsteps since ASICs are taking over. When ASICs were taking over Bitcoin it was soaring in price. It created a huge bubble which popper right around Black Friday of last year. Will the release of Litecoin ASICs contribute to its growth? Since the new 80Mhs hardware have shipped Litecoin\u2019s network has risen over 200%. That might be a clue as to why the price is rising so rapidly. According to this reddit thread: Here is a good argument in regards to whether the increase of the total hashrate of Litecoin\u2019s network have any correlation to it\u2019s price: It is interesting to see whether Litecoin will fall into a bubble because of the adoption of ASICs or maybe this is just another pump to an already dying coin.

The address that the dogecoins were sent to is D9cDqmVjYXdeDjMtXSV7Z3LgiHvRZ12bPX The address shows around 400 million dogecoins, the other wallet contains the rest of the coins that make up roughly 500 million doges. SecureWorks is set on finding out who the hacker was and so far revealed that \u201cthe findings strongly indicate that the threat actor is of German descent.\u201d The hacker also used a private pool in order to mine the coins this gave the hacker the anonymity he wanted because since the pool is owned by the hacker it will not release his account\u2019s logs. This eliminates evidence that could link the hacker to his identity. SecureWorks also accessed the data being sent to the NAS boxes and were able to ascertain the dogecoin wallet address holding the fraudulently mined coins. Inside the configuration file for the CPUminer the string foilo.root3 appears to have a link to an account on GitHub and BitBucket, if charges are going to be filed the police could subpoena the two companies to reveal logs about the account and it\u2019s IP addresses. Then they could link it to the hacker\u2019s identity. If the hacker used a VPN or Proxies or if the hacker simply used that name to divert investigators he could be safe. This dogecoin mining attack represents a creative approach to generating cryptocurrency through fraudulent means. The more classic approach is the use of a Botnet and installing miners on the infected computers, however infiltrating powerful corporate computers is a more creative way to approach it. Another example of such an attack happened last month, where unknown hackers attempted to distribute bitcoin mining malware through the torrent of the popular game Watch Dogs, this attack was targeted at torrent users who thought they could could play the game for free, ironically their computer\u2019s were infected. Another attempt was aimed at cellphone users who downloaded wallpaper apps, one such app made it to the Google Play app store which installed mining software on the user\u2019s devices.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/openbazaar-is-the-decentralized-ebay/", "author": "Mark", "title": "OpenBazaar is the decentralized eBay", "content": "It is a decentralized marketplace for instantly trading with anyone using Bitcoin. Here is a youtube video you can watch that will explain it further: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4vtUPJEmqg Everything old becomes new, long ago bazaars were the center of trade, people interacted with each other directly in their local marketplace. There were no middlemen telling them what to sell, how much to charge. We live in a different era, even though the internet is global governments and corporations are restricting free trade. They collect your data and violate your privacy, censor transactions, and take their own. Its time to take control back, OpenBazaar is a free and open market for the digital age. No censorship, no fees, no middlemen, just the freedom to exchange directly with each other. OpenBazaar looks like a direct competitor to eBay, we are familiar with the strict policies of eBay and how they side with the buyer, they take hefty fees and together with PayPal they maintain complete control over the market. They are the middleman in the transactions between buyers and sellers and the fund\u2019s are at their mercy to do as they please. eBay is also trying to take a bite into the Bitcoin market by issuing patents in order to centralize Bitcoin. OpenBazaar is in a way trying to stop one of the 4 biggest threats to Bitcoin, by combating the attempt of various corporations to monopolize and centralize Bitcoin. OpenBazaar looks to minimize fees, and minimize regulation of the market. While it sounds like a great idea which would benefit the buyer and the seller, they will face a hard time passing government regulation when it comes to their business. Auction businessed must have KYC (know your customer) regulations which help identify fraud and scams, will OpenBazaar also adhere to those regulations? If it will not then it will be simply another version of the SilkRoad. Thus, OpenBazaar is a direct competitor to eBay and Paypal. There lies one problem, the transaction volume of Bitcoin is nothing compared to the one of Paypal. You can see the ditribution of daily market volume HERE. Because the daily transaction volume of Bitcoin is much smaller OpenBazaar might have a hard time at first, but once Bitcoin\u2019s volume increases they should have no problem directly competing with PayPal. One of the dev team from OpenBazaar replied to the following on reddit: It is an interesting loophole that if OpenBazaar acts as a nonprofit service available to the public, comparable to craigslist it will be able to avoid any regulation. Unlike craigslist, OpenBazaar is not a centralized entity, it is more of a protocol such as bitcoin, bittorrent, TCP, etc. OpenBazaar could base their business model on craigslist\u2019s because essentially it is the same service except with Bitcoins. The concept of a functional P2P market platform which OpenBazaar runs on was originally based on the DarkMarket, which won the Toronto Bitcoin Expo Hackathon in April. The main mission of OpenBazaar is to enable two parties to engage in a transaction without having to rely on the security and integrity of a questionable centralized network (i.e eBay). Hoffman, who is the project maintainer at OpenBazaar reflected at the notion that a decentralized marketplace is a hotbed for illegal activity (referring to the SilkRoad here), he said that OpenBazaar will push for lawful uses of it\u2019s service. Unlike in a centralized trading platform where the trust is instilled in a questionable centralized authority, in OpenBazaar the user will be able to establish figures of authority that can help certify transactions and settle disputes between users. Hoffman compared this to the arbitration process on cetralized platforms which leaves those involved in the transactions without any say in the dispute since the centralized authority has all the power. OpenBazaar aims to provide a service that is nonprofit. Thus, the code is open source and is available to view on GitHub.

You will predict the price of litecoin at 7/6/14 11:59 PM PST. The person who comments with the closest price will win 1 LTC which will be given out on 7/6/15 12 AM PST. Please post the price prediction + your litecoin address. Happy speculation! NOTE: I will approve the comments later you just need to lock in an answer before 8:20 AM PST Litecoin has officially decoupled from bitcoin. While bitcoin jumped in price following the USMS auction litecoin is still going down in price. As of 7/2/14 litecoin is currently worth $7.79 on BTC-E. Lets take a look at the latest chart from BTC-E: As we can see here someone lucky was able to score a $2 Litecoin. The price rebounded right away however the downtrend still persists. What is causing that? Why is Litecoin dying? This is a big hit for litecoin. It will bring it down quite a bit but hopefully it will be able to rebound. So why litecoin is dying? Lets first analyze Litecoin. It is different from Bitcoin in 3 major ways. It runs under a different algorithm, the block speed is much faster, but the network power is not as strong as the one of bitcoin. Back in the good ol days Litecoin was peaking at $45, but what happened now? The simplest explanation is that the hype died. Litecoin was hyped to be ASIC resistant with it\u2019s Scrypt mining algorithm and because the confirmation arrive much faster it seemed like an improvement upon bitcoin. However, we have since seen the release of the GridSeed which is an ASIC miner for litecoin. The release of the ASIC miner ruins the hype that litecoin is in fact ASIC resistant because GridSeed proves otherwise. The other hype that surrounded litecoin was it\u2019s faster transaction speeds and how it must be a better network. Wrong, just because a block can be solved faster and the confirmations arrive faster does not mean that the network is faster. Think of it this way, litecoin\u2019s blocks take 2.5 minutes to be solved on average, and bitcoin blocks take 10 minutes to be solved. So in other words, 4 litecoin confirmations = 1 bitcoin confirmation security wise. So just because a confirmation arrived earlier does not mean that the transaction is just as secure as that of a longer arriving confirmation (hope that made sense). So since litecoin is not asic proof and faster transaction speeds do not equal the same security, the hype has died. There is no real use for litecoin now because it is just another version of bitcoin with a few differences. It falls in the category of all the other litecoins which do not have any significant difference or improvements. There is always another side to the argument. Some people do not think that litecoin is dying but that it is simply going through a \u201cgrowing phase\u201d just like bitcoin did. Here is what kodofodder has to say from reddit: Maybe the development of stronger and more powerful ASICs will raise the price of litecoin, or maybe bitcoin\u2019s algorithm will be compromised and litecoin\u2019s Scrypt will be proven to be more secure. However, right now the market is not looking very good and if you are holding litecoin i wish you all the best.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/purseio-amazonbtc-exchange/", "author": "Mark", "title": "PurseIO \u2013 Amazon/BTC exchange", "content": "Essentially Purse.IO is a solution to two main problems. First, it solves the problem of purchasing items at Amazon with Bitcoin. Since the retail giant has not yet implemented Bitcoin into their payment method Purse.IO is creating a platform on top of Amazon. The next problem is buying BTC with credit card. Sure you can go to coinbase, but that requires time to setup, time to verify, and also many banks now are starting to oppose any sort of Bitcoin related transactions or transfers. Sure there is BitPay who already processed over $100 Million in Bitcoin transactions but Purse.IO aims to provide a unique service that specifically integrates Amazon. The company is marketing its service to people who would like to purchase items from Amazon with Bitcoins and for people who would like to buy Bitcoins with their credit card. By matching these two markets, Purse.io is able to offer Bitcoin purchases at Amazon. Not only that, but the purchases are powered by a buyer\u2019s \u201cdiscount\u201d which increases the incentive to use the service. The discount is another way of setting a fee for the transaction where the currency is being converted form CC to BTC and visa versa. As Andrew Lee, co-founder of Purse.io said: Here is how it works, there are two options to choose from once you sign up. You can either spend bitcoin or buy bitcoin. If you decide you have some bitcoins and you want to purchase some Amazon items you can click the Spend BTC button which will redirect you to another page where you would create a wishlist, add the URL of the item, select your shipping preference and submit the order. The page looks like this: When you submit your order it gets added to the list of available orders where people who want to convert CC -> BTC can buy you the item from their Amazon account and ship the item to the provided address that the buyer provides. The other option, is if you want to buy BTC with Credit Card you press Buy BTC and that takes you to a page which lists all the available offers. The good news is that the site has a profound user base and there are a lot of offers available. Once you decide on an offer you would the accept it. Next comes the interesting part, a popup window comes up with a timer prompting you to complete the purchase on amazon add the order number and hit submit. Then once the item has been shipped and received by the buyer he notifies Purse.io at which point the Bitcoins are released from escrow. As the second co-founder of the company, Kent Liu explained, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like an exchange, but with that Amazon layer\u201d. What would Purse.IO do if Amazon shut them down, after all they are relying on Amazon to make a profit. The founders seem to have thought about that, but believe that they are simply providing a service that is in demand. Lee said: \u201cWe think we are helping Amazon, they don\u2019t want to take bitcoin now. They are not ready for it\u201d According to Purse.io amazon\u2019s marketplace strategy which includes all of its third party sellers is weak. If creates a sort of complexity which other retailers who do accept Bitcoin like TigerDirect and Overstock do not have to deal with. Maybe Amazon made a mistake allowing third party sellers in their marketplace, after all there is Ebay for that? Maybe Amazon is caught in between two ends of the spectrum where one is a full blown retailer/ private reseller like Overstock and TigerDirect, or a marketplace which promotes 3rd party sellers like Ebay. Amazon has already tried to make certain advances toward Bitcoin but they have been very subtle and involved issuing patents to try and take advantage of the crypto market. Nevertheless, it seems that the founders and co-founders of Purse.IO feel confident about their service and it\u2019s demand:", "date": "2014-06-29T12:14:57+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 6, "day": 29}

The site is well built and looks legit, the way you can deposit/withdraw funds with either by Skrill, Bank, PayPal, or OKPay. As of 6/23/14 People on reddit have reported that coins were sent to their Bitcoin address and the funds were never deposited to their for of payment. Adog353 on reddit said: In fact, btc-plaza had shills who would falsely advertise on reddit about how much money they made from btc-plaza. Examples of such threads include: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/28vzoq/i_sold_146_btc_at_btcplazacom_with_bank_transfer/cif42bf The thread read: It really tried to socialengineer users into selling their BTC on btc-plaza. It brought attention to the government taxing taxes on Bitcoin but at the same time send a subconscious message that btc-plaza is a great site where selling 14.6 Bitcoins valued at roughly at $8683 is no big deal. There are not many clues that the site has left, but here is what the reddit community has so far. 1ExR8rKj7CeZ9xQjrfgUjXNZqUxbGXDCbp The above is one of the addresses to which the Bitcoins that were supposed to be sold on btc-plaza were sent to. btc-plaza never made a payout according to the buyer so the 2.01732 BTC that is in that wallet are considered stolen. On their site btc-plaza has a WhoIs Guard on their domain which means that the true identity of the real owner of the domain is concealed from the public\u2019s view. The identity however could be retrieved if the authorities issue a subpoena to the WhoIs Guard. The above information is most likely bogus, but on their site, under CONTACT they display some contact information, including their company phone number (+39) 346-304-3460 Their email address [email protected] and their location: Via Monti Sabini 3 Milano, Italy. Finally, we have their twitter account under @Btplaza UPDATE: @btplaza is apparently not linked to the exchange site btc-plaza and is in no way related to the scam, check out the comments section. With all the information in hand a simple subpoena should release the logs of their WhoIs guard should lead to a matching IP. As a lesson we should learn not to trust new companies offering \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d type services, especially if the company\u2019s domain is not fully transparent and has a WhoIS Guard. If you would like to see other scams that have recently occurred, take a look at this phishing site which appeared on the top page of Google and imitated the popular blockchain.info, or maybe Coin.MX which was found to have a major vulnerability in their security allowing anybody to deactivate an account based on just the email. Finally, here is an example of a malware that mines coins on your computer. As a tip for the future when attempting to use a new company\u2019s service do a basic background check about the company, a simple WhoIs search for the domain and a Google search for reviews will reveal if the company is legitimate or not. Furthermore, there are far better alternatives that are well established and are known to be legit. Localbitcoins is a great site that allows criaglist type Bitcoin trading in many forms of currency, the trades are made between individuals and and are based on escrow and reputation.

We passed 500 which was quite a hurdle in terms of emotion. We were able to sustain high volume and are creeping up to the 1000 mark. Just today we hit 600 so what will happen now? As a disclaimer the following will be pure speculation and your comments are more than welcome in regards to this. Lets take a look at the following BTC-E chart on Bitcoinwisdom: The key to reading Bitcoin charts and the approach I am going to take to predicting the future market price is to look at patterns. Yes it seems obvious but we need to establish what exact pattern are we looking for and we need to use the right timeframe. You see the bigger the price swings the bigger the time frame that you want to use to read the chart. So in our case since the latest price increase matches similar 10-20$ jumpst which started happening on May 19 we will use that as our time frame to read the chart. Here is the same modified chart but with some extra lines to help you see the pattern: As we can see the pattern Bitcoin is following right now is it stays stable for a short while (12-48 hours) and then does a quick jump of about $10-$20. While this is all speculation a clear pattern is visible, according to what has been happening since May 19th we should be seeing the Bitcoin price stabilize for the next 12-24 hours followed by a price increase of $10-$20. How can you take advantage of that knowledge? If the market keeps following this pattern our best option is to hold and wait for the uptrend to finish. If you are more of a risky player you can try waiting for the next price increase and try to sell right at the peak. So you would watch the market until you see a bright big candle like here, by the way this happened yesterday read about it HERE: in which case you would try and create a sell order about $20 higher. If you time and price the order right you should be able to sell right at the peak. Then you can rebuy at a lower price before the next price jump and make a few extra $$$. Last time I tried it (yesterday) I sold most of my coins at $578, after watching the market for a couple hours and seeing Bitcoin go as high as $590 I decided to rebuy at $580, I did loose on the $10 increase but I am glad I re bought because now Bitcoin has passed $600.

The update opens doors for Bitcoin related Apps to be added to the App Store. Since the ban of the Blockchain app from the App store, Apple has been known to be strictly against Bitcoin related Apps, however following the Worldwide Developer\u2019s Conference (WWDC) Apple issued an update that can be reviewed here. Under the Purchasing and currencies section in the App Store guidelines and update was issued related to virtual currencies: It is still unclear whether Apple will allow Bitcoin apps in it\u2019s App Store but there is definately a chance that reputable Bitcoin companies that have active KYC regulations will be able to place their mobile apps on the market. For example, Coinbase and Bitstamp are both very reputable companies who verify their customer\u2019s identities and keep detailed logs of all the transactions, because they follow federal laws in their respective territories they their apps will follow the issued guidelines and should be accepted in the App Store. However, certain exchanges such as Cryptsy or BTC-E who do not have active KYC regulations and are not transparent from the corporate point of view would not pass Apple\u2019s App Store guidelines and thus would not be able to place their Apps on the App Store. In other words with the new update Apple will only accept apps that handle bitcoin transmission as long as they comply with all the state and federal laws. Don\u2019t get it wrong, apps that show the price of Bitcoin and ones that do not facilitate Bitcoin transactions are still allowed on the App Store, an example of such apps are Coinbits \u2013 a Bitcoin price ticker and news faucet, and ZeroBlock, which is also a Bitcoin price ticker and calculator. It seems that Apple decided to follow Google\u2019s direction with its App Store, to allow Bitcoin apps but with much caution and regulation. We cannot say for sure how the update from Apple has affected Bitcoin but we can speculate. Bitcoin had a rough time where it was stuck in the low $600 during the past 2 days, However, now the price of Bitcoin is at $650. The news from Apple and the lack of bad news is definately helping Bitcoin. As of 6/2/14 Bitcoin is following an uptrend with strong volume. Lets also take a look at Apple\u2019s stock to see how it has been doing since the announcement: The above two pictures show a 5 day and a 6 month spread of Apple\u2019s stock.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/coinnext-is-the-cheapest-way-to-buy-and-trade-altcoins/", "author": "Mark", "title": "CoinNext is the cheapest way to buy and trade Altcoins", "content": "In simple terms CoinNext is an Altcoin Exchange. It is an exchange just like BTC-E and Bitstamp but in addition to trading Bitcoin to USD it allows for trading of other pairs of coins. It is directly comparable to Cryptsy, however it is fully transparent. What is so different about CoinNext and why is it the next big Altcoin exchange? This time the exchange is transparent and no anonymous. This means that it is easier to trust the exchange more and to know that it would not pull a MtGox on your bitcoins. The team consists of 2 founders. The engineers and product developers were both early Bitcoin adopters and already had experience building Bitcoin startups. The team previously built and sold a Bitcoin startup which gave them enough experience to undertake the difficult task of starting a regulated fully transparent exchange. The team started working on Coinnext in late 2013 and as active coin traders themselves they decided to build the exchange for themselves to use. It is no secret that a successful product is developed to fulfill a service that is missing on the market. The main problem with cryptocurrency exchanges was the lack of trust. Many of those exchanges are anonymous and are hosted off shore, so while they provide a much needed service they are able to get away with the low trust issue because there is no other alternative. Coinnext aims to rebuild that trust with the consumer as a cryptocurrency exchange. It is an exchange where the developers (and the consumers) would feel comfortable trading, one that is transparent and professionally built from the ground up. Every altcoin exchange faces similar diffculties, one of which is what Altcoins to add? There are so many Altcoins out there and an exchnage needs to figure out which ones have enough value in order to add to the trading platform. Let us first take a look at how Cryptsy adds Altcoins to its exchange. If you did not know by now, Cryptsy is the largest Altcoin exchange right now. They add Altcoins based on a voting system. The way the system works. The system is a mix of incentivized voting ballots. Every user gets a free vote for a coin. Voting with bitcoin donations is also another method for Cryptsy\u2019s users to voice an opinion on which altcoins should be added. User input is important to this process being open. Coinnext took a different approach to adding Altcoins, according to CoinNext: Coinnext does not have 300+ coins on the exchange because they only launched 2 weeks ago. Coinnext manages to add 2-3 new coins per day. They look at basic parameters when adding coins, they will not list coins such as \u201cCoinye\u201d because of copyright violations, but for coins which do not face any legal risk Coinnext gives almost any coin a chance. Since Coinnext is newly launched they are currently offering zero trading fees for the first 3 months as a way to promote the exchange. Because many altcoins are not worth very much, the fact that you can trade them with zero fees is a huge plus. The lack of fees makes Coinnext currently the cheapest exchange to trade your coins, so take advantage of this opportunity and sign up HERE. There is no ID verification required beyond verifying your email, so do not be worried about taking time to get your account verified you can sign up and start trading in minutes. The cryptocurrency market grows exponentially and startups that are in the crypto market must be scalable and be able to handle growth. Competition will heat up and more companies are going to try and take a bite out of the market profits. According to Coinnext: Coinnext uses Cloudflare Hosting which should mitigate DDOS attacks, they use the google app for business engine which is clearly scalable and is used by many successfull companies. Coinnext has the latest version of SSL (patched hearbleed) and uses HTML5 to support mobile devices as well. Overall the website is developed on a professional level and with the added transarancy of the founders and developers Coinnext is the next big Altcoin exchange.

CoinMX is a site that allows you to instantly buy and sell Bitcoins using your credit card. It is similar to coinbase and virwox in that it allows you to instantly purchase Bitcoins. It also has an affiliate program if you want to make some extra cash by referring your friends. A picture is worth 1000 words, so take a look for yourself (taken form reddit): Let us take our focus away from the rude customer support and focus our attention on the real issue here \u2013 security. The representative blocked a user\u2019s account without verifying ANY information. The problem with that is now any person can ask a representative to lock a certain account by only providing an email address. If you are currently using CoinMX I suggest you withdraw your funds immediately and stop using them. If someone with the wrong intent gains access to your email address he will be able to block your account and any pending orders you might have will be disabled. Besides, Bitcoin is rising like crazy right now so it would not be in the best of your interests to sell. The flaw here is the support center, CoinMX is using a third party as their customer support and a poorly paid representative will not care about your account or the company\u2019s reputation. Here is a word from CoinMX after what happened, the following response is quoted from reddit: They mentioned that they will update the thread once they research thoroughly (they misspelled it) into the user\u2019s account and discuss with their technical team. That is a meaningless statement that will not result in any action, instead what they should have done is said that they will implement higher security verification processes before representatives can take action on accounts. Remember the Ebay hack which happened a couple weeks ago and resulted in the second largest database hack in history. The vulnerability in that hacking attack were the Ebay representatives. Their login credentials were stolen or compromised and hackers were able to gain access to the servers. This is a similar situation where once again the representatives are the weak link in the company. Since it is such a repetitive issue other startups that are looking at creating customer support should take into consideration any security flaws that the CS department might create. Here is another reply on the reddit thread form CoinMX this one is referring to Ashley, the representative who was featured on reddit: One sentence does not make sense: \u201cwe have systems in place so harm cannot be done on anyones account.\u201d That is clearly not true because we saw a great example how simply giving the customer support an account\u2019s email can lead to the account being blocked. We also see further spelling mistakes in their responses, this time they spelled foolproof wrong. Given the fact of how flawed CoinMX\u2019s security system is for such a big exchange we clearly see that CoinMX\u2019s interest is not about their customer but about their profits. Hiring cheap customer service call centers might increase the profit margin but it does not take in prespective the customer\u2019s security and their funds. I advise you to stay away from CoinMX there are plenty if similar services just like CoinMX who do not have such security flaws, check out Virwox and Coinbase if you are looking to buy Bitcoins with a credit card, paypal, or a bank account.

That means that the processing power of the network is spread across multiple points which reduces the chance of failure, security breaches, and obviously centralization. However, in this sea of decentralization there are centralized services which are powered by the distributed cryptocurrencies. One of such are exchanges. They are in essence centralized islands in a sea of decentralization. What the Coinffeine team in Spain is trying to accomplish is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. An exchange that does not have a central authority which leads to a single point which is prone to failure, scams, and other unpleasantries. Here is how Coinffeine works, it provides secure peer-to-peer transactions. Currently in order for someone to engage in peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions one must have full trust in the other party, for exchange purposes you do not know your party and trust an anonymous Bitcoin user is not something any rational person would do. To combat this trust issue, Coinffein\u2019s exchange algorithm implements a distributed contract. This contract concept is known as a micropayment channel. In this micropayment channel both parties engage in a multi step transaction. Here is the breakdown: In other words, the algorithm is the escrow. After the initial commitment of funds is completed, the algorithm verifies that both parties have submitted the funds and then broadcasts the transaction to the network. The source code for Coinffeine is available on GitHub for you to review. Coinffeine\u2019s Chief Technology Officer Ximo Guanter said that most of the coding for the company has been done on the side as a project, however, after the huge support the team would be devoting their full attention to Coinffeine in hopes to speed up the development process. Guanter also said that Coinffeine is looking to become the first decentralized Bitcoin exchange. There are other similar projects that are trying to create a decentralized exchange so it almost seems as if this project is a race to the moon. However, Coinffeine\u2019s team has high hopes because Coinffeine might be the first fully functional decentralized cryptocurrency exchange but Guanter must prioritize his development and lead the team in the right direction. We hope to hear more from Coinffeine when the project hits the Alpha or Beta stage. Currently the project is in the pre-alpha phase, but the company claimed to have received a certain amount of seed funding to support further development. I am sure they will not have a problem with funding when their business is in the Bitcoin community which loves to donate and fund good causes and projects.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/most-profitable-way-to-mine-with-your-gpus/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Most profitable way to mine with your GPUs", "content": "Depending on what you want to achieve with your mining rigs you have many options to choose from. In this article I will explain the different ways to mine bitcoins with your GPU mining rigs. If you are wondering whether you should mine using GPUs or ASICs please refer to THIS ARTICLE for an explanation. In this post I will assume that you have built a working GPU mining rig and know how to the process of mining works. The first idea to look at when configuring your mining rig is whether you want stable return, or make a bet and have a chance for a larger return in the near future. Depending on the route you go there are different mining techniques for that. Depending on what route you choose you will have different options regarding the mining pools and the mining algorithm that you should choose. If you are going to go with a stable return then you must immediately convert all your coins that you mined to fiat in order to ensure the stability. That limits you as a miner to mine coins that are already on exchanges. However, the other way to approach mining is similar to gambling. you can go to cryptocointalk and check out the releases for new coins, choose a coin that you believe will enter on an exchange and one that will have some sort of future and mine away. The difficulty will be low and once the coin goes on an exchange (hopefully) you will be able to dump it and make crazy profits. If you want to go with a more stable return, there are many ways to do that. One of the ways is to mine the Scrypt algorithm on a multipool mining pool. Scrypt is the standard algorithm that most GPU miners use and has quite a lot of hashing power devoted to it. The only problem with Scrypt is that there are ASICs coming out for it. ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. ASICS are cheaper, consume less power, and have way more hashing power then GPUs. As a result, when Scrypt ASICs come out then those miners who still mine Scrypt using their GPUS will take a huge hit in profits. You see the more hashing power a blockchain gets the higher the difficulty rises, so unless you can keep buying more GPUs to match the ASICS there is no point mining an algorithm that already has ASICS for it. Take for example Bitcoin. The only way to profitably mine bitcoin is to buy a Bitcoin miner. Miners like Antminer or Terraminer are all ASICS which are designed only to mine bitcoin. Mining bitcoin with GPUs or CPUs is obsolete because of the ASICS that overpower the other components. Similarly, if you want to continue making profit with you GPU mining rig you must switch to an algorithm which does not have an ASIC developed for it, and hopefully an algorithm which will never have an ASIC developed for it. Guess what? There is an algorithm like that, and it is called Scrypt-N. Scrypt-N is an algorithm which modifies itself every couple of years, as a result developing ASICs for it will render useless after a year of mining and it takes way longer than a year to develop a functioning ASIC. I currently mine vertcoins which use the Scrypt-N algorithm. I believe that Vertcoins are the next litecoin and will dominate the crypto market as the number 3 coin. This is not an article about promoting vertcoin but the only thing I want to say about vertcoin is that unlike other alt coins it has its own miner (vertminer) and as a result it looks very promising. Keep in mind there are other coins based on the Scrypt-N algorithm which are not vertcoin, you could possible mine a newly launched Scrypt-N coin if you believe it will have future and increase in value. Back to the first idea that I was talking about. Do you want a small stable return or do you want to take a risk and invest and hope that the bitcoin market will go up along with the altcoin market? If you want a stable return then once you configure your miner you need to make sure to turn your profits from coins to fiat. If you are willing to take a bet you can either mine a newly launched coin that is not on an exchange, or go ahead and mine an established coin like vertcoin, which might go up in price someday. If you need help configuring any mining software please feel free to post in the comments and I will write you a detailed tutorial on how to set it up.", "date": "2014-04-23T22:19:33+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 4, "day": 23}

However, many altcoins fall into scams and give in to quick pump and dumps which inhibits altcoin potential. We have heard alot about dogecoin, which is a litecoin based cryptocurrency that took off as a meme and received alot of media attention. However, now we have PonziDoge \u2013 A dogecoin ponzi scheme, which is simply an experiment of the popular Ponzi Scheme. Acording to ponzidoge: It is not really a ponzi scheme because the participants know what is going on. The way it works is you are given a bitcoin address on the homepage. You send and then you may or may not get your money back. If you do end up getting your money back then you will get 110%. This is similar to how a ponzi shceme works because in a ponzi scheme you are given other investor\u2019s money as your return. This is the same thing because you are getting your money back only when other investors have invested. So if nobody else keeps investing and you are the last in line you will end up loosing your money. If you have some dogecoins to spare go to ponzidoge and play the such honest very wow game", "date": "2014-05-03T23:47:48+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 5, "day": 3}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/how-to-install-coinpunk-on-centos-6-5/", "author": "Mark", "title": "How to install coinpunk on Centos 6.5", "content": "Coinpunk is a bitcoin wallet platform. It is open source and is available for free, you can see the repository HERE In the docs section there are available tutorials on how to install coinpunk on OSX and Ubuntu. However there isn\u2019t one on how to install coinpunk on Centos. While Ubuntu and Centos are both linux distros the installation procedure must be modified. In this tutorial I will try to walk you through how to install coinpunk on Centos. The first thing you must do on CentOS 6.5 is install bitcoind. For coinpunk you must use/install a specific version of bitcoind which can be found here: now we will untar the tarball and start installing dependencies. You can find a tutorial on how to install the necessary dependencies HERE I will briefly walk through how to do that. If you don\u2019t already have it you will need to install git. first we update yum and make sure your original deps are up to date: We will need to install some dependencies from source so lets get to it, create a working directory and start compiling Berkeley DB 4.8.30 OpenSSL Boost Next we need to compile bitcoind. Navigate to the bitcoin-watch directory and run If you get an error that looks something like this: Then you will need to link the boost directory where the libraries are installed. Here is how you would run your compile commands: If everything compiles then we will now configure the bitcoin.conf file Now in the bitcoin.conf file put This will make sure that bitcoind starts up in the testnet so you can test functionality. I would let bitcoind run overnight not on the testnet and synchronize with the blockchain before continuing but it is up to you. If you get an error or still having problems compiling check out this OTHER tutorial on how to install bitcoind on CentOS 5.5 just remember that you need a specific version of bitcoind for coinpunk so when following the instructions download the right version. Still all of the commands are the same. Once you have bitcoind up and running and the blockchain updated lets start installing coinpunk. First we need to clone the repository and then install the nodejs dependancies: Now we will setup the config files. Navigate to ~/coinpunk and add the config files from the templates. go ahead and do the same to the config template in ~/coinpunk/public Now we will edit the config files to connect to bitcoind. The ports are 18332 for testnet and 8332 for prodcution. Now we will also have to setup the config file in the public folder, which looks like this: Since we will be first launching coinpunk on the tesnet then keep the line network:testnet, otherwise if you will compile for production change it from testnet to prod. Now navigate back to the coinpunk folder in ~/coinpunk and fire it up Hopefully coinpunk starts, you might get the following error: This means that the port is already in use by another program. If that is the case then you must kill whatever process is using that port or choose a different port. bitcoind is most likely the process using it so go ahead and check with: if you received the EADDRINUSE error then a process should show up. kill it by using it pid Now go ahead and try again to start coinpunk. The way to check if coinpunk is successfully installed is navigating to: So for example since my domain name is www.coiniv.com then I would navigate to http://coiniv.com:18332 If you are using chrome it should give you a warning about the ssl certificate and how its not trusted click proceed and you should see this: This is it, now you are hosting a wallet on the network just like blockchain or coinbase. Thanks to the existing tutorials provided by coinpunk.com which can be found HERE If any of you are facing issues feel free to post a comment and I will help you get it resolved.", "date": "2014-05-03T23:04:47+00:00", "year": 2014, "month": 5, "day": 3}
