Although that is nothing new, it would appear some of these attacks are a lot more successful than others. One recently discovered \u201cElectrum botnet\u201d has successfully stolen $4.6m worth of Bitcoin from victims in recent months. It is expected over 150,000 users have been infected by this malware already. When it comes to dealing with cryptocurrencies and their associated wallets, nearly all projects have a version of Electrum available to its users. In the case of Bitcoin, it would appear the Electrum wallet has been very popular for some time now, which also makes it a prone target for criminals and individuals with nefarious intentions. It would appear a dedicated botnet is now targeting these users, and is doing so in a rather successful manner as well. Most of these attacks have been apparent since December of 2018. A bit of odd timing, considering how the Bitcoin price has tanked significantly since late 2017. One would expect criminals to go after users of this wallet when one BTC is valued at $19,000, rather than near the $4,000 range. Even so, a total of roughly $4.6 million has been stolen to date, which further confirms the efforts have paid off in spades already. The botnet in question operates in a pretty interesting manner. It would appear the attackers have spun up several malicious Electrum nodes. These malicious nodes display an error to legitimate Electrum wallet apps, telling them to download a new version of the client. While the new client can be downloaded from GitHub, it is not through the official Electrum repository. Most users should be able to tell the difference right away, but novice wallet users might not be aware of which repository is legitimate. It is evident the Electrum team is all too aware of what is happening tot heir network. In recent times, the team has mimicked the approach by these criminals to display error messages in users\u2019 wallets and force them to update through the legitimate GitHub repository. Moreover, the team has ensured clients on versions before 3.3 can no longer connect to public servers accordingly. Although the fake upgrade message looks as legitimate as one would expect, it is evident users need to conduct their own research first and foremost. When downloading software updates, it is always best to do so through the official website, rather than following links shared through the application itself. It is a slight workaround, but if it can keep funds safe, users should not be too bothered by this handful of extra steps. Despite the best attempts by the Electrum team, Malwarebytes has confirmed the number of infected machines running the illegitimate client continues to increase every month. While the numbers tend to fluctuate a bit, it would appear most of the victims reside in the Asia Pacific region, Brazil, and Peru. Additionally, the number of infection vectors remains unclear, as only three of them have been uncovered so far. However, it is expected there could be as many as a dozen vectors or even possibly more. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

After hitting a low of $3,300 back in December, Bitcoin has been increasing in value ever since. The momentum and volume has been building little by little the past 5 months and today we hit a new all time high for 2019! At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $5754 having risen over $100 in the past hour alone and over $355 in the past 24 hours. Get excited because this is a new all time high for 2019! The good news is that we broke through the $5600 resistance level which we tested last week with no luck. At this point, all the eyes are on the charts to see if we can either reach $6000 or at least turn $5600 into support instead. The two major roadblocks ahead for Bitcoin\u2019s price are undoubtedly the $6000 psychological number and the $6300 level which held as support for over 6 months during the end of the bear market. Looking at the technical indicators, the RSI is extremely oversold which is only natural for such a sudden jump. What\u2019s surprising is that the market still hasn\u2019t broken past the upper Bollinger Band signalling potential for further gains. Another interesting fact about this breakout is the timing with the ongoing Bitfinex scandal. It would seem that the alleged $850 million cover-up would provide more bearish pressure to the market, but so far this has not been the case. This goes to show that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency have their cycles regardless of current events. While certain news can have an effect on the price of certain cryptocurrencies, they shouldn\u2019t be used as a telltale sign of what\u2019s about to come. All eyes are currently on the charts to see how far this bullish momentum will take Bitcoin.

Especially during the weekend, one never knows in advance how the markets might swing. Today, it seems the Bitcoin price is taking a rest day and is willing to sacrifice some of its recent gains in the process. No big drop is expected at this time. After setting a new all-time high for 2019 just yesterday, the value of Bitcoin must now contend with minor bearish pressure. It is difficult to determine if traders are simply cashing out profit or the market trend is showing signs of a long-term reversal. Either way, the price has dropped below $5,700 again, yet there is no indication the losses will continue to pile up as the weekend progresses. Over the past 24 hours, the Bitcoin price lost 1.57% in value. That is a bit surprising to some, albeit a rather expected turn of events for most veterans. A minor dip like this will not trigger a panic sell moment by any means, as it gives speculators another chance to stock up on BTC below $5,700. That is, assuming they believe the price will rebound and go higher sooner or later. Regardless of how the current market trend may look, there will always be people who remain very bullish. Bitcoin Pizza is a very interesting account in that regard. This user expects an upward price potential that could hit $2m at some point, which would make the current price look like peanuts. Bully the Bear, on the other hand, is not necessarily convinced this bullish momentum will remain in place for much longer. Depending on how the coming hours play out, there might be a very steep drop to $4,500. That is not something traders and enthusiasts would like to see happen, albeit there is nothing one can do about it if that trend were to materialize. Eduard shares a rather interesting tidbit of information. Someone who claims to have obtained episode 4 of Game of Thrones information is asking a 0.5BTC fee from interested parties to share said information. It seems a rather fishy offer first and foremost, yet there will always be people who fall for such potential scams. All in all, the current Bitcoin trend is nothing to be overly concerned about. As some of the losses have been recouped already in quick succession, it is unlikely this is the beginning of a bearish trend. Some minor pushback over the weekend is rather normal for cryptocurrency markets. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Digital currencies are an increasingly popular option for online gambling due to the protections afforded, and BitcoinCasino.io is the latest casino to emphasize it for deposits, withdrawals and promotions. Payment Options One of the topics that interested us most when we were first introduced to this new casino was the payment options. Was this actually a bitcoin-only online casino? The answer to that question is no. The operators are using Bitcoin to refer to all digital currencies as people use Kleenex to refer to all tissue. Other digital currencies supported include Dogecoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. The casino also supports traditional deposit and withdrawal options like Visa, MasterCard, Neteller and Skrill. Customer Support Another focal point for us when reviewing a new online casino is customer support. It is good to be wary of casinos that do not offer around-the-clock support and other client-friendly services. BitcoinCasino.io does. The website itself can be set to six languages: English, German, Chinese, French, Spanish, Russian, Japanese and Turkish. The casino offers 24/7 live support via live chat or an integrated messaging system. If there is one knock against the support it is that there is no phone number published as far as we can tell. Additionally, the current FAQ on the website is a bit lacks and needs to be more fleshed out with common questions. BitcoinCasino.io does not require you to download and install a dedicated client. Instead, you access the games directly through the website. The emphasis here is on instant play casino games. There are two notable benefits to this approach. You can access the games through any modern web browser. That means that BitcoinCasino.io supports most smartphones and tablets. It also supports laptops and desktop computers that use Windows, Mac and Linux as well as various netbooks. The other advantage is that the casino gets to build its game library from many providers rather than just one or several. Online casinos that take a multi-provider approach tend to have the largest game libraries. BitcoinCasino.io is no exception. It is also adding games at a fantastic rate. It was first introduced as an online casino with more than 1,000 games. By the time our review was complete, it was boasting more than 3,000 games across 23 providers. Recent press releases have promised more new games as well as more provider partnerships added to the mix. The website even lets you filter games not just by type, such as slots or video poker, but by provider, such as NetEnt or Evolution Gaming. The casino also has a solid offering of live dealer games, such as blackjack or roulette, and that selection is expected to grow too. Many of the promotions BitcoinCasino.io offers are geared toward Bitcoin and other digital currencies. The casino will match your first deposit fully up to 0.2 BTC and your second by 50 percent up to 0.2 BTC. There are reload bonuses that include free spins. The casino also offers an intriguing quest system in which you chase various activities to gain experience points, level up and earn cash back. This is essentially a rewards program but laid out with a rather novel and fun approach.", "date": "2019-05-03T11:19:10+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 5, "day": 3}

Company valuations, the price of gold, everything is compared to Bitcoin sooner or later. The following media franchises all have a total revenue which is lower compared to Bitcoin\u2019s market cap. Do keep in mind this is not intended to be derogatory toward these franchises. This article was written when Bitcoin had a market cap of $95.5 billion. Most people alive on the planet today are familiar with Star Wars. The movie franchise spawned many books, a few TV shows, video games, and tons of merchandise. All factors combined attribute to the estimated $65bn in total revenue generated by this media franchise. Interestingly enough, the merchandise sales vastly outperform the box office, home video, video games, book sales, and TV revenue combined. Considering how Star Wars is still an ongoing franchise, its total revenue will undoubtedly continue to climb, but it is likely Bitcoin\u2019s market cap will too. Most people tend to overlook Mickey Mouse & Friends has been around for 91 years at the time of writing. Over those several decades, the franchise noted just $457.4m of revenue in the box office, which is still a respectable number overall. VHS & DVD sales brought in another $280m, but the retail sales are the main money maker for this media franchise. With $69.85bn in sales, it is the main reason why this franchise has become so successful. Even so, it is still valued lower than Bitcoin\u2019s current market cap. Not too many people will be surprised to learn Winnie the Pooh remains one of the most successful media franchises to date. It event received a new movie adaptation not that long ago, further confirming things are heading in the right direction. With $460m at the box office, $58m in DVD and Blu-ray sales, and $74.515bn in retail sales, Winnie the Pooh will remain in the top 10 for quite some time to come. There has always been a certain appeal to felines, yet none as commercialized as Hello Kitty. This particular cartoon character has become a cult figure in its own right, which also explains its massive merchandise sales of roughly $80bn. Combined with $23m in Manga magazine sales and $3m in Music CD sales \u2013 which seems somewhat surprising \u2013 Hello Kitty is still going very strong, even in 2019. Although its total revenue is not that far removed from Bitcoin\u2019s market cap, there is still a clear gap to overcome. When it comes to the biggest media franchise in the past two decades, Pokemon should never be overlooked. It is still bringing in tons of money through video games, the TV shows, movies, and merchandise. Its licensed merchandise brought in $61.1bn so far, with the video games adding $17.138 bn and the card game bringing in another $10.254bn. Manga Sales, Anime box office, and home entertainment add another $3.6bn worth of revenue, which brings the total to roughly $90 billion. This is by far the biggest \u201cCompetitor\u201d to Bitcoin\u2019s market cap at this time, albeit everything needs to be put in its proper perspective. Fun Fact: Harry Potter, Marvel Cinematic Universe, and Spider-man\u2019s total revenue combined equals $89 billion, which is still lower than Bitcoin\u2019s market cap.

While altcoins may show some independent momentum now and then, it won\u2019t fool experienced traders in the slightest. As of right now, the Bitcoin price is moving up ever so slightly, as the $5,500 level has come into play again. To date, it has been a rather interesting year for Bitcoin in many different ways. After overcoming a major price retrace, it would appear the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is moving in the right direction again. Although the $5,600 level might not necessarily be retaken this week, it seems unlikely a drop below $5,000 will materialize, which is what most people are interested in. Over the past 24 hours, the Bitcoin price has gained 2.08%, which is more than respectable. This gain allowed the BTC value to briefly surpass $5,500 again, although it seems likely that will remain a level of contention for some time to come. It is a more than interesting gain regardless, especially with the weekend not that far off. The opinions regarding this price increase are all over the place on Twitter. Andres Mejia is quite pleased with his Bitcoin trades, primarily because he appears to be growing his balance quite nicely so far. Although these are only small amounts, one often has to start out small prior to entering the big leagues. Marc Friedrich, on the other hand, seems to keep an interesting opinion on gold, Bitcoin, and fiat currency. In fact, he wonders why people don\u2019t dump fiat currency, which is in a bubble of its own. Other bubble assets on his list include shares, ETFs, real estate, and so forth. Very intriguing thoughts which are not that easy to counter. Kelyoss is looking at the Bitcoin chart with some degree of high expectations. However, he also acknowledges there is some bearish pressure when looking on the 4-hour chart, albeit the daily chart seems to indicate this uptrend may have some life to it after all. Anything can happen in this industry at all times. When Bitcoin rises in value, most traders and enthusiasts will be rather happy with how things are going. However, this could lead to some price pressure for most of the altcoins, as their internal ratio with Bitcoin could suffer from a bullish BTC run.

Not entirely surprising, as yesterday saw an unexpected amount of market momentum as well. Even the Bitcoin price seems uncertain as to which direction it should in. With a current value of just over $5,300, a very intriguing trend is taking place. The current value of Bitcoin determines the momentum for all alternative markets. When Bitcoin gains value, alternative markets tend to follow suit, up to a certain degree. Today, there is a lot of uncertainty affecting all markets, primarily because Bitcoin\u2019s future price direction remains difficult to predict. Over the past 24 hours, the balance for Bitcoin looks far from impressive. There is a 0.47% gain in USD value, yet this only helps to bring the value to a hair over $5,300. It is entirely possible this level will hold this time, but that seems rather unlikely. The overall trading volume remains rather solid, though, which could offer some relief over the next few days. On social media, there are plenty of debates regarding the future value of Bitcoin. It would appear Tom Lee, a well-known financial \u201cexpert\u201d, expects to see a new Bitcoin all-time high by 2020. A very interesting opinion, although this user has been wrong on multiple occasions. As such, this information needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Those traders who keep a close eye on the Bitcoin chart may not some interesting patterns emerging. Mr. Chief shares a very interesting chart which seems to indicate the bullish momentum might not relent. However, these charts can often work in mysterious ways, either for better or worse. Although Bitcoin memes have become increasingly rare, CoinExchangeData sees this as a time to poke some fun regarding Bitfinex and Tether. Although this debate will most likely continue for quite some time to come, it hasn\u2019t hurt the Bitcoin value all that much. All things considered, the coming days will undoubtedly offer some market excitement. Whether the bears or the bulls will be in charge, is a different matter altogether. While it is good to see Bitcoin surpass $5,300 again, there are plenty of reasons to expect another dip fairly soon. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

That is only normal, as the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency dictates the pace for all alternative markets. After a rough Friday, it would appear the Bitcoin price is recovering slowly. There is still a lot of work ahead before the next bull run can begin. While yesterday\u2019s dip took plenty of people by surprise, it seems most of that negative momentum has not carried over to today. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be any further bearish pressure later today or tomorrow, but right now, things are looking relatively safe. Retaking the $5,300 level might not necessarily happen just yet, although the markets remain unpredictable. To put this in perspective, the past 24 hours have yielded a 0.71% Bitcoin price increase. As the current value sits at $5,273, plenty of traders will be happy with how things are going. Even so, it seems unlikely the price will hit $5,400 or more in the coming hours. On social media, there are also plenty of helpful people who simply want to see Bitcoin grow. Crypto Sara reminds people of how Bitcoin will not go to zero by any means, regardless of how the market trend may look at any given time. People often tend to forget any value above $0 is a good thing for Bitcoin, thus there hasn\u2019t been anything to worry about for several years now. Even though many enthusiasts are still concerned over the Tether-Bitfinex debacle, others are more than willing to move on from this issue. Carsten wants to end the short-term correction and see BTC go bullish again. While that is an understandable sentiment, one also has to acknowledge this industry isn\u2019t as cut-and-dry in that regard. When looking at the Bitcoin chart, it quickly becomes apparent the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency can easily swing either way.

In fact, the Bitcoin price, which dictates the pace for all currencies, is on the decline as well. Although the losses are still relatively small right now, it is evident the overall momentum is not necessarily pleasing too many users. When the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency dips ever so slightly in the red, alternative markets are usually quick to follow suit. As of right now, it is evident the bearish pressure affecting Bitcoin will wreak havoc among altcoins for several hours to come. Even if Bitcoin were to regain some lost value, it seems unlikely the alternative markets will fare well. Not the outlook most people are looking for, but there isn\u2019t much to be done about it. As far as the Bitcoin price is concerned, it would appear there is a minor amount of bearish pressure to contend with. This minor 1.14% decrease in value will not necessarily cause that many problems in the near future, but for altcoins, it can be quite catastrophic. With a current Bitcoin value of $5,241, one has to wonder what will happen next to the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency in the days up ahead. The uneasy market momentum triggers a lot of interesting backlash on social media. CryptoHarmonic sees some interesting market momentum shaping up right now, although the charts never tell the full story of what is going on. While the Bitcoin Dominance Index is certainly on the rise once again, it will be interesting to see how things look in a day or two from now. Kay Kurokawa has come up with an interesting way of comparing student debts, banks, and Bitcoin. Although the comparison makes a lot of sense to cryptocurrency enthusiasts, there will be plenty of other people who remain confident banks are still the go-to financial solution. regardless of how bad things may look. Longing Bitcoin is never a bad thing, although one always needs to do their own research first and foremost. As far as actual Bitcoin memes are concerned, Pete has come up with one that will tickle the funny bone of Bitcoin Maximalists. Saying \u201cnyet to shitcoins\u201d has become a somewhat popular meme as of late, even though there are plenty of alternative projects which are effectively worth checking out these days. Diversification is crucial in the cryptocurrency world at all times, after all. Even though there is no real reason for a new Bitcoin value decline, there is always a chance the bears will remain in control for a longer period.

While not all projects will gain mainstream success, the Bottle project is rather intriguing. It is advertised as a Bitcoin browser, which has seen some big update in recent times. Now is a good time to look closely at what Bottle offers exactly and why users should care. Whereas most people look at the Bitcoin blockchain as a way to record transactions, there is a lot more functionality than meets the eye. It is possible for users to directly upload files to the Bitcoin network where they will remain as immutable transactions. Every upload remains anchored into the blockchain as soon as the associated transaction has received the necessary network confirmations. Bottle aims to facilitate this aspect by letting users anchor any file they see fit onto the Bitcoin blockchain. What is rather interesting is how there are no restrictions in terms of file extensions to be uploaded. Whether it is video, images, or documents, all of these options are available to Bottle users. Even applications and interactive pages can be added, which creates a few interesting potential business files. The most important aspect is how this solution can be used to verify proof of ownership, which is quite valuable in terms of potentially monetizing specific content. Being able to upload files to the Bitcoin blockchain is one thing, but accessing them is something else. Bottle is a browser-oriented solution which lets anyone \u201csurf\u201d the Bitcoin network for potentially uploaded files. It also makes it easier to directly access files through the native supported URIs supported. One interesting aspect of this network is how files will remain accessible as there is no \u201ccentralized server\u201d hosting these files. Anyone who wants to create new applications or interactive pages based on files hosted on the Bitcoin network can do so as well. All it takes is a bit of code to retrieve the necessary files from the blockchain directly, which will always remain accessible. Unlike other options, this does not make use of the HTTP or HTTP protocol. It is a very compelling offering, although one that might not necessarily appeal to the masses at this time. With the Bottle solution available for everyone to use, getting people excited about this concept is the next logical step. While the Bottle team acknowledges they are primarily building tools which might not be used for years to come, the fact this exists shows how versatile the Bitcoin blockchain really is. With a dedicated browser tool to access the Bitcoin network in a different manner, the team is building something unprecedented. Bitcoin is not \u201cthe next web\u2019, as it is in a category of its own. When looking at the bigger picture, there will be a market for Bottle and what it provides. In terms of achieving decentralized content distribution, file sharing, and even video hosting, this solution has a lot of future potential. It may take a while until the masses become aware of how versatile the Bitcoin network is, or what Bottle does, but that doesn\u2019t mean solutions like these should be overlooked.

With all of the top markets down by 5% or more, things will not necessarily improve over the course of the weekend. Bitcoin is leading this negative trend, as it too is bleeding value at a rather alarming rate. Over the past 24 hours, the Bitcoin price deficit has only grown worse. With a 5.22% loss, one BTC is now valued at just $5,239. It is not the value traders and enthusiasts had envisioned after what appeared to be a very solid week. The push to $6,000 has been postponed, by the look of things, although this market can always rebound when people least expect it. Not too many people are holding out hope to see a Bitcoin ETF getting approved. In fact, those chances are slim to none. Looking forward to the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust is something one could certainly do at this time. However, that decision won\u2019t come before late October of 2019. Bringing Bitcoin to retail investors remains an ongoing struggle which is very difficult to resolve. Even so, some solutions already exist in this regard. Grayscale thinks now is a very good time to promote their own business, as it makes investing in BTC a lot more straightforward. The downside is how investors are never in control over their investment, which may or may not be appealing to potential clients. For those who keep a close eye on the current Bitcoin chart, it quickly becomes apparent things are not looking very smooth. Crypto Chad expected a scalp to $5,300 but that option seems out of the window right now. However, he also expects a potential price jump to $6,000 soon, which will not happen anytime soon either. A further downtrend seems to be the only logical course of action. For the time being, it is somewhat difficult to make sense of this bearish trend. There is no real reason for these price declines, yet it seems unlikely the markets will shift into a higher gear over the course of the weekend. At the same time, unpredictability has been a selling point for Bitcoin and other currencies as well. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/top-cryptocurrency-exchanges/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Top Cryptocurrency Exchanges 2019 (US Friendly Bitcoin Exchanges)", "content": "Last Updated: May 1st, 2019 When someone is first introduced to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, one of the first services they interact with is an exchange. In order to experience the beauty of Bitcoin, you first must acquire it. There are a number of ways of getting your hands on some crypto, but the easiest method is by far signing up to an exchange and purchasing it with fiat. Also Read: Top Bitcoin Casinos 2019 (US Friendly Crypto Gambling) There is a massive amount of cryptocurrency exchanges on the market. Some are better quality than others, some have less fees than others, and some are outright scams. Instead of overwhelming you and listing each exchange available, we handpicked the top 5 cryptocurrency exchanges for you to use, especially if you are in the US. The exchanges below are not listed in any particular order, but each have their own unique strengths depending on what you\u2019re looking for. One of my personal favorite exchanges, Binance is a top choice if you are looking to trade cryptocurrency on a daily basis. Binance is a cryptocurrency exchange based in China that was launched in 2017. The exchange grew so quickly that it set the record for the fastest profitable startup to achieve unicorn startup in history. If you didn\u2019t know, for a startup to achieve unicorn status they must have a valuation of over $1 billion. Binance was able to go from a valuation of $0 to more than $2 billion in under 6 months. When it comes to its platform, Binance has one of the smoothest interfaces and fastest trade engines. While minor hiccups occur here and there, overall the exchange has one of the best reputations on the market thanks to its CEO Changpeng Zhao. If you are looking to trade crypto on an exchange with high volume, fast trade engine, and bulletproof security then Binance in the right choice for you. Visit Binance Exchange Some love it, some hate it, but if you are a US resident looking to purchase cryptocurrency with fiat the easiest and simplest way possible, then Coinbase is the right choice for you. Being a US based exchange, Coinbase is subject to strict regulatory guidelines. That\u2019s one of the reasons that the company receives so much backlash from the crypto community, as inherently most people in crypto are against rules and regulations. Nevertheless, when it comes to purchasing crypto with fiat, Coinbase provides an unparalleled platform to do just that. It\u2019s important not to confuse Coinbase with Coinbase Pro \u2013 a digital asset exchange. The difference between the two platforms is the former is mostly for buying crypto with fiat and storing it, and the latter is an exchange in the traditional sense similar to Binance. Visit Coinbase Exchange Gemini is a US based cryptocurrency exchange that is owned by the Winklevoss Twins. The exchange is meant for more institutional investors but is open to the general public as well. If you are looking for a reliable exchange to make withdrawals and deposits of crypto to and from your bank, Gemini is the right exchange for you. Gemini is used to dealing with large deposits and withdrawals and has a great relationship with various banks. Once fully verified, you are able to convert crypto to USD and withdraw it via ACH or Wire Transfer and receive it the next day in your bank account. Moreover, if you would like to support the Winklevoss Twins, using their exchange is the best way to do so. Visit Gemini Exchange This list wouldn\u2019t be complete without including a decentralized exchange (DEX). It\u2019s 2019 and DEXs are all the hype right now. Using a Decentralized Exchange means you don\u2019t have to risk your balance and if the exchange goes down you still have access to all your coins. Essentially you get all the benefits of a traditional cryptocurrency exchange with none of the risk associated with it. The Binance DEX is a newly launched exchange that only has one token listed so far \u2013 Mithril. Nevertheless, it\u2019s worth making an account on the exchange and keeping a close eye for any future listings as the price of any newly listed cryptocurrency will most likely spike either after the announcement or after the actual listing. Visit Binance DEX Exchange For our last featured exchange in the list we had to include CryptoBridge. This is a much more developed decentralized exchange that already has dozens of tokens listed on it. It\u2019s extremely easy to get set up with CryptoBridge and by doing so you will get to experience a decentralized exchange firsthand. The exchange includes a desktop client that you can use so you don\u2019t actually have to go to their website at all. CryptoBridge has an assortment of tokens that you might not find on other exchanges so if you like to trade smaller cryptocurrencies you should definitely check out CryptoBridge. One drawback to choosing CryptoBridge over the Binance DEX is if you are a US citizen you will be required to undergo user verification prior to being able to use the CryptoBridge exchange. Visit CryptoBridge Exchange If you still aren\u2019t sure what Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange are, don\u2019t fret. This is an extremely common question that is often overlooked. In order to understand what crypto exchanges are, it\u2019s best to first understand what problem they are trying to solve. Back when Bitcoin first came out in 2009, if someone wanted to get a hold of some cryptocurrency there were only two options \u2013 mine it or buy it from someone else. If you wanted to get $100 worth of Bitcoin you would have to either fire up those ASICs or find someone on a forum to sell it to you. Finding someone to sell you some Bitcoins has a few drawbacks, first you have to actually find someone willing to part with their Bitcoins and second you need to either use an escrow service or establish some sort of trust between you and the other party. This is where cryptocurrency exchanges come in, you are able to use a service to purchase cryptocurrency without dealing with the logistics of finding someone to sell you coins, establishing trust, exchanging the fiat etc. Moreover, when we refer to cryptocurrency exchanges, we mean both those services that allow you to buy crypto with fiat (Coinbase, Gemini), and those platforms that allow you to trade one crypto coin for another (Binance, Binance DEX, CryptoBridge). Now that you understand what a basic cryptocurrency exchange is, let\u2019s step it up a level and go over decentralized exchanges. We will use the same method of understanding what problem the services are trying to solve exactly. Decentralized exchanges were born as a response to the constant hacking of exchanges which resulted in customers losing their balances. Imagine you are trading Bitcoin for Ethereum on an exchange. You deposit some coins and trade it for Ethereum, you decide to hold the Ethereum and leave the balance on the exchange. A few months goes by and you read on the news that the exchange has been hacked and someone has siphoned off all the funds. You realize that you had your ETH on the exchange and now that the exchange has lost all of its coins, so did you. The beauty of decentralized exchanges is that they don\u2019t have a central database that can be hacked. Moreover, you never really send your coins to the exchange\u2019s wallets, the coins remain on your computer. As such, even if the decentralized exchange is hacks or goes offline, the funds are still in your possession and thus can be recovered. There is no real drawback to decentralized exchanges form a consumer point of view. However, when it comes to developing such an exchange, it\u2019s much harder to code because you can\u2019t use traditional development methods that rely on centralized databases. The terms Bitcoin exchange and Cryptocurrency exchange both mean the same thing. Bitcoin exchange is more of an older term for those services that only deal with Bitcoin and not other cryptocurrencies. These days most exchanges that support Bitcoin also support a handful of other coins. Because cryptocurrencies operate with the same blockchain technology, it\u2019s easy for services to add an assortment of cryptos rather than just using Bitcoin all by itself. The answer to this question heavily depends on the specific exchange we are talking about. At the end of the day, any traditional exchange will have vulnerabilities that may allow hackers to empty customers\u2019 balances. However, most top exchanges have had a great track record the past few years of not having any major issues with losing customer balances. Moreover, if you want to be completely safe you should use a decentralized exchange (CryptoBridge, Binance DEX) which reduces the risk of losing your balance to essentially zero. If you are looking to either acquire cryptocurrency with fiat or convert one crypto to another, then using an exchange is the best way to do so. Depending on which exchange you use, you can easily buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP and much more cryptocurrencies with your bank account or credit card. You can also convert these coins into any other cryptocurrency you desire assuming the exchange has it listed. There are some key mistakes you should try to avoid when using any cryptocurrency exchange. 1. Don\u2019t store coins on an exchange for a long period of time. If you are looking to hold a certain cryptocurrency for a prolonged period of time (a few months+) then it\u2019s best to transfer those coins to a wallet to which you own the private keys to. There is a phrase: \u201cIf you don\u2019t own your private keys you don\u2019t own your coins.\u201d Cryptocurrency exchange wallets usually don\u2019t give you access to your own private keys, so on the off chance that the exchange gets hacked you will lose your balance. By transferring the coins from the exchange to a wallet you fully control you avoid absorbing the risk of losing your balance through a hack. 2. Make Sure to Enable 2FA. Another often overlooked mistake is not enabling 2FA when using exchanges. 2FA means Two Factor Authentication, and it\u2019s a method of authentication that requires a second \u201cfactor\u201d which is usually another device. With 2FA, in order to log into your account you not only have to input the password, but you also have to input a code that is usually sent either to your phone or email. This makes the account much more secure and harder to hack. To step it up a level some exchanges even employ 3FA \u2013 Three Factor Authentication. 3. Don\u2019t trade on emotion. This applies not only to trading cryptocurrency on exchanges but also to trading any stocks or commodities in general. Never make any impulse decisions based on emotion. The market has its cycles and if you push the red button any time a fluctuation happens that makes you uncomfortable you will end up in the hole more than if you waited for the market to stabilize or rebound.", "date": "2019-05-01T04:54:41+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 5, "day": 1}

While no one really expected the Bitcoin price to retrace so violently all of a sudden, a correction was on the horizon in any case. Right now, the drop to below $5,500 may seem scary, albeit it will likely end up as a blip on the chart in a few days from now. When the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency decides to take a break from its bullish trend, the altcoins are quick to drop in value as well. Right now, the entire top 20 in the crypto rankings is in the red, except for Tether, which is a stablecoin. Bitcoin\u2019s sudden downward spike has caught plenty of traders by surprise, albeit it is not necessarily something to be too concerned about it. Over the past handful of hours, the Bitcoin price has lost 3.2% as it dropped well below $5.500 again. With a current value of just under $5,440, it would appear Bitcoin is still in a good place compared to just a week ago. This particular downtrend, while a bit steeper than expected, will serve a purpose in the long run. No market can go up in value indefinitely. Even though there are far too many people praying for a market bounce at this time, Nando is not bothered by the price action. He is still all-in regardless of what the current market sentiment might indicate. It is also true BTC is far from intimidating once people take the time to learn what the excitement is all about. Pocket Full of Hodlonaut isn\u2019t too happy with a recent Forbes article trying to discover the \u201cnet Bitcoin\u201d For all intents and purposes, there may not even be a next Bitcoin, nor is there a need for one. Putting Binance Coin on the same level as BTC will undoubtedly rub a lot of people the wrong way, thus the comparison serves no real purpose whatsoever. For those who want some sort of opinion on where the price is headed next, The Wolf of All Streets is looking at the hourly chart first and foremost. There is a very real chance this is a minor and temporary dip, although the pressure might intensify for a little while. After a double top, anything can happen where financial markets are concerned. When looking at the bigger picture, Bitcoin will be fine under any set of circumstances. The same doesn\u2019t necessarily apply to alternative markets, which primarily derive value from Bitcoin these days. There will be some very intriguing market momentum in the coming hours where Bitcoin is concerned, although it seems unlikely any further damage will be done in a convincing manner.

The hourly Bitcoin price charts don\u2019t always look too promising, yet the overall uptrend has not relented by any means. A push to $5,400 is very plausible at this time, albeit it will require a bit more effort by traders to make it happen. Over the past few days and weeks, there has been a notable momentum shift where Bitcoin is concerned. After finally reclaiming $4,000, $4,500, and $5,000 respectively, traders started to get excited. Now that BTC remains above $5,200 without too many problems, that excitement seems to intensify, for obvious reasons. Today\u2019s momentum will keep traders excited. Although there is just a 0.8% Bitcoin price increase to $5,327, the current momentum confirms the uptrend hasn\u2019t been broken by any means. Some of the hourly BTC charts don\u2019t look overly promising but no real damage has been done so far. As long as the trading volume remains intact as well, there is no real to be concerned. On social media, the ongoing uptrend has many people excited. BTC-Baker can live with a regular 10% increase in value, as it means the price has shifted by $530 or more in the right direction. As such, it appears this user expects a push to $6,300 fairly soon. That might be a bit too optimistic under these circumstances, but one never knows how things will unfold. Crypto Millionaire App is one of the many people who keep an eye on Bitcoin\u2019s price trend. He also likes to share memes with the community at times, which is certainly appreciated. It is evident there is a lot more to Bitcoin than just the price increases. Those who survive a few price cycles can be labeled as \u201cveterans\u201d in their own regard. A different meme is offered by Cryptocurrency Wire. Comparing the physical aspect of $1.6bn worth of gold with $1.6bn worth of Bitcoin is rather funny, although it is also quite telling. For those who want to move big sums of money around in a convenient manner, using physical bullion is not the advisable choice. When looking at the bigger picture, Bitcoin\u2019s pace will continue to dictate the momentum for all alternative markets. So far, things are going according to plan, but Bitcoin\u2019s gains are not exactly spectacular either. Assuming things remain as they are, Bitcoin seems poised to hit $5,400 in the coming days.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/5-quick-tips-to-spot-the-many-bitcoin-hyips-on-the-internet/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "5 Quick Tips to Spot the Many Bitcoin HYIPs on the Internet", "content": "Scams and get-rich-quick schemes are nothing new in the world of cryptocurrencies. In the past few months, there has been a notable increase in so-called Bitcoin HYIPs. A high-yield investment program is a very common scam, especially on the internet. Below are a few tips to easily snuff out such Bitcoin HYIPs and avoid dealing with financial losses because of those fraudulent offerings. One of the main reasons why Bitcoin HYIPs are so popular is because of the projected returns on investment. While good money can be made with cryptocurrencies at any given time, one has to keep in mind those profits are never guaranteed. Any company or service provider claiming otherwise is most likely running an HYIP or some other form of dodgy investment project. There can never be guaranteed high investment returns, or even daily guaranteed returns when dealing with volatile cryptocurrency markets. Some enthusiasts may have noted there has been a vast increase in the number of potential Bitcoin investment companies. Rest assured over 90% of these companies are unlicensed or unregistered, which means they are not even allowed to offer such products or services at this time. Moreover, any user defrauded by such companies will struggle to get their money back if something were to go awry, which will happen sooner or later. Potential investors should not be fooled by companies which boast a company registration number. It is pretty common for Bitcoin HYIPs to list a UK-based company registration number. That is primarily because obtaining such a number is cheap, easy, fast, and can be done online. Simply because such a number is displayed on a website does not mean users are dealing with a genuine investment firm. Steering away from such companies is usually the most advisable course of action. A lot of the Bitcoin HYIPs in existence today tend to reach new customers through aggressive marketing tactics. Whether it is via unsolicited emails or by spamming users on social media, these companies do not shy away from going overboard. After all, a Bitcoin HYIP is only sustainable as long as fresh capital is injected into these scams. If that is not the case, the project will run out of steam very quickly. Ignoring unsolicited offers is always the advisable course of action, as strangers on the Internet should never be trusted. As one would expect from aggressively advertising Bitcoin HYPs, they will coax as many people into investing \u201cNOW\u201d or miss out on this golden opportunity. FOMO is a very real thing in the cryptocurrency industry, and HYIP scammers know that all too well. As such, they will try to play people\u2019s heart stringers and force them to invest at rates which are simply too good to be true. Cryptocurrency investments will always be accessible, and there is no genuine pressure to buy something today, as tomorrow or next week will still present its own opportunity regardless. One of the more interesting developments in the world of Bitcoin HYIPs is how more and more projects start to use fancy jargon. This is done in an effort to goad as many investors into contributing money over time. While that is not necessarily a bad thing, many people have no idea about cryptocurrencies or blockchain projects in the first place. They will only know a handful of words associated with either industry and fall for these cheap tactics as a result. Doing a bit of minor research can usually help people tell the difference between fake and genuine investment offerings. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Roughly 24 hours later, and all of those woes are well behind us. The Bitcoin price is moving up once again and has already reclaimed the $5,500 level without any problems. This offers some short-term hope for speculators and enthusiasts. Not too many people will be surprised to learn yesterday\u2019s market dip was a very brief one. As there was no real reason for Bitcoin \u2013 or the alternative markets \u2013 to retrace all that much, it appears to be a temporary correction which can work out quite well. As Bitcoin is now surging ahead again, things have begun looking up for all markets in quick succession. Over the past few hours, the Bitcoin price has successfully surpassed $5,525 following a 1.35% increase in value. A more than respectable bounce, although the push back to $5,600 might not necessarily be too easy. Slow and steady often wins the race where financial markets are concerned. It has been a good month for the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency, thus some stability wouldn\u2019t hurt either. On social media, there are plenty of people keeping tabs on any Bitcoin-related coverage by mainstream media outlets. Since those companies don\u2019t always have the best of reputations, some posts will be shut down pretty quickly. Elmo isn\u2019t too happy with CNBC\u2019s recent coverage of a wealth manager dissuading people from buying Bitcoin, as the manager is a blockchain believer and expects crypto to fail. A valid sentiment, but one that will also be criticized. On a completely different note, BTC FX EA is looking at a much brighter perspective. There are no further losses where Bitcoin is concerned, yet it seems the Forex market is also rebounding at the same time. A bit of an unusual correlation between the two industries, although it is a prominent sign for better things to come as well. While Bitcoin and memes do not get together all the time, R. Mani is quite happy with the way things are going for Bitcoin. The current price of roughly 5,000 euros is a major milestone, yet this user expects it to hit a value of 200,000 euros \u2013 or roughly $235,000 \u2013 in 2021. A bit of an optimistic outlook, albeit it never hurts to have ambitious dreams. All things considered, it would appear as if Bitcoin is on the right track to hit $5,600 once again in the coming days. The bigger question is whether or not it will act as a future support level for the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency.

Many people hope the Bitcoin price notes a new all-time high this year, yet others fear this is yet another fake breakout. For now, the value remains above $5,600, but sustaining it is very difficult. Although Bitcoin\u2019s bullish trend is causing some disruption among the alternative markets, very few people will actively care about that right now. When Bitcoin dominates the headlines everywhere, money is pulled out of altcoins faster than people can blink with their eyes. It is the normal flow of things in crypto land, and will continue to be for quite some time to come. As far as the current Bitcoin price trend is concerned, there is another 4.43% gain over the past 24 hours. Not only has this allowed Bitcoin to surpass $5,400, but $5,500 and even $5,600 as well. A very bullish surge which might meet some form of a correction fairly quickly. This will be pretty interesting to keep an eye on over the coming hours. On social media, there is plenty of BTC price talk to choose from right now. Whether any of the predictions will turn out to be correct, is anyone\u2019s guess, for the time being. Crypto Assassin expects either sideways trading or a pretty steep dump over the next few hours. Even so, Bitcoin has defied traders\u2019 expectations on many occasions, thus things can easily head in either direction. A very different sentiment is shared by #Facepalm, who only has three words for the cryptocurrency community. Those words are \u201cBitcoin\u201d, \u201cbull\u201d. \u2018now\u201d. It is certainly true Bitcoin is on a bull run for quite some time now, yet the main objective is always to ensure such growth remains in place for an extended period of time. That may prove to be a big hurdle, given the recent gains. Perhaps the funniest Bitcoin chart was shared by EmptyBeerBottle quite some time ago. This user expected a clear cup-and-handle pattern for Bitcoin, and even drew an actual mug with a handle on the price chart to prove a point. A very funny chart, albeit one that certainly came true in the end. When looking at the much bigger picture, it is evident Bitcoin\u2019s uptrend will cause altcoins to crumble and lose value for some time to come. However, if the Bitcoin surge were to come to an abrupt halt, it would seem plausible those altcoins will bleed even more value because of it. As such, there will always be some momentum to enjoy in the hours to come, either for better or worse. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Ever individual ecosystem has its own setbacks and advantages, although most of the attention still revolves around Bitcoin first and foremost. When it comes to the overall number of daily Bitcoin transactions, it would appear the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is on the right track to set a new all-time high pretty soon. Over the past few months, there have been some interesting changes as far as the number of Bitcoin transactions is concerned. After the massive spike taking place between early and late 2017, things have certainly taken a turn for the worse in the months after. This downward spiral also correlates with the Bitcoin price tanking significantly, which usually leads to fewer confirmed network transactions. Thankfully, these statistics are almost as volatile as the Bitcoin price itself. As the value per BTC has started showing signs of a recovery in early 2019, the number of BTC transactions seems to be moving up alongside it. To many people, that is a good sign, but others will shrug it off as a mere coincidence first and foremost. There are still a lot of questions whether or not the number of transactions and the actual Bitcoin price are correlated in any significant manner. What is rather apparent is how the number of confirmed TXs has gone up significantly in recent months. The slow and steady growth over the past few months would seem apparent when zooming out at the statistics chart to an all-time overview. However, when looking at the 180-day chart, there are many ups and downs to be noted in this regard. A recent drop from 360,000 to 218,000 transactions per day occurred in early March, although that may turn out to be a minor blip on the radar. Ever since that time, it would appear things have resumed their normal uptrend. In November, the average number of daily transactions sat at roughly 250,000. Today, that number has increased to just over 400,000, albeit there is some minor volatility in this regard as well. No one knows for sure what is driving this increase, although there are many different theories circulating on social media. A few new services have launched lately which seem to hook into Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain to record data, which would obviously pump the number of overall TXs accordingly. The bigger question is whether or not a new all-time high will be reached in the coming months. The current all-time high sits at just over 490,000 TX, which is still significantly higher compared to the current figures. However, one also has to keep in mind that figure was reached at a time when Bitcoin\u2019s price hit an all-time high of just under $20,000. To reach a new transaction ATH, a similar price surge may be required. At the same time, the current momentum is slowly pushing the figures to that ATH level even when Bitcoin hasn\u2019t reached $6,000 again. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts will be happy to see the number of transactions move up again. In most cases, more transactions are a clear sign of ecosystem growth. As it is rather difficult to determine what is driving these transfers exactly, there are many possible scenarios at play these days. The end result remains the same, as more transactions are a good thing. At the same time, this will undoubtedly spark new block size debates. Scaling remains one of Bitcoin\u2019s weak points even today, thus this positive trend can easily create some negative sentiment accordingly. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

This does not equal his entire Bitcoin portfolio, as he gets to keep 7 out of 288 BTC. Even though many people flock to the darknet and try to remain anonymous, their identities are found out sooner rather than later.

In the case of Matthew Phan, his arrest has unveiled a lot of interesting tidbits of information. First of all, it would appear this user has been active since 2015. Considering how the darknet has become a lot more popular in the past decade, that is not entirely surprising. Similar to the vast majority of darknet vendors, Phan bought illegal narcotics and a gun from the darknet and successfully sold the items in questions for a profit. All of these transactions were facilitated with Bitcoin, which remains the leading cryptocurrency on the darknet. Based on the evidence gathered during the investigation, officials were able to tie a total of 288 Bitcoin to this darknet user. Of that balance, 281 has been used to engage in darknet-oriented activities, which is why this amount will need to be forfeited accordingly. The remaining 7 BTC will remain in Phan\u2019s possession, as they are tied to trading gold in a legitimate manner, and have nothing to do with darknet transactions. While it is not uncommon to see darknet users multiple their Bitcoin holdings through various activities, it is evident Phan was in the process of running an online narcotics ring of some sorts. It is also believed he was an active buyer and vendor on both the Agora and Evolution marketplaces. To date, it would appear neither of these platforms is still in operation today. The global crackdown by law enforcement agencies against such platforms has resulted in numerous top markets being shut down in quick succession. Even though Phan will be forced to forfeit most of hit Bitcoin stash, he still awaits further sentencing at this time. Running a narcotics ring on the darknet usually yields a prison sentence of multiple years. What type of sentencing he may receive, remains anyone\u2019s guess at this time. Nor is there any official date as to when the verdict will be rendered. This case serves as another example of how engaging in darknet activity as either a buyer or a seller will usually lead to a jail sentence in the long run.", "date": "2019-04-22T12:16:10+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 22}

Not because the industry is no longer lucrative, but simply because such attacks have seemingly become so common it isn\u2019t necessarily newsworthy anymore. However, the average Bitcoin payment associated with ransomware attacks has risen significantly. Over the past few years, there have been numerous news stories involving malware and ransomware. Criminals have fully embraced this new business model to make a lot of money. Despite the best attempts by security researchers to ensure such attacks cannot be profitable, it seems the ransomware industry is still firing on all cylinders. In fact, the longer it remains a business, the higher the overall profitability seems to become. According to a new report shared by Coveware, it has become apparent criminals still make plenty of money when using ransomware types. More specifically, the average payment requested has increased by nearly 100% in the past few months alone. Although this could indicate the attacks are shifting from consumers to corporations and governments first and foremost, it is not a positive development by any means. Higher returns will attract more criminals exploring the ransomware business, as everyone wants to make some quick money on the side. In the report, the average payment \u2013 in Bitcoin \u2013 is $12,762 for Q1 of 2019. This is significantly higher compared to the figures attributed to Q4 of 2018. At that time, the average Bitcoin payment was listed as $6,733, which is still a very steep amount. Especially when considering how the Bitcoin price has decreased significantly in recent months, these amounts are exuberant, to say the very least. Such a dramatic shift in payments is not entirely abnormal. Researchers confirm the attacks themselves are becoming more sophisticated and targeted. Particularly the Ryuk ransomware strain is making a lot of headlines lately, as it used in conjunction with most known \u2013 and some undisclosed \u2013 remote desktop protocol vulnerabilities. By gaining remote access to target systems, criminals can determine their appropriate course of action to infect networks with ransomware accordingly. What makes Ryuk such a troublesome malware strain is how it prevents users from restoring data in a convenient manner. System recovery functions built into the Windows operating system will not be accessible, which allows the hackers to demand a higher ransom payment first and foremost. In some cases, those amounts are as high as $300,000, which goes to show the business is still firing on all cylinders. Moreover, there is a genuine chance even more sophisticated attacks will be launched in the future. Another factor contributing to the rise in average ransomware payments is how affected corporations effectively regain file access after making a payment. While that has never been a guarantee where ransomware is concerned, it seems the companies effectively paying the money have a good chance of accessing their systems again without major problems. As such, it is only normal corporations are more willing to meet these ransom demands. In doing so, these corporations also allow for more targeted attacks to be performed, which creates a vicious cycle. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

More specifically, it seems as if the Bitcoin price is on the verge of testing $5,300 but it has not successfully done so. The current momentum indicates another potential uptrend is looming on the horizon, although its chance of success remains to be determined. It has been a pretty interesting week for Bitcoin enthusiasts and speculators. The lack of any bearish momentum tends to make a lot of people excited, even though the actual gains over the past few days are pretty small in general. Even today, there is a very small bump in the right direction, but insufficient to break the $5,300 resistance. To put this in perspective, there is a 0.82% gain to bring the current Bitcoin price to $5,290. It is a very solid price level, for all intents and purposes, yet it also falls short for those who want to see a massive bull trend. The $13bn worth of trading volume should, in theory, be sufficient to keep the uptrend going and even test the $5,300 level before the day is over. Social media is often considered to be a rumor mill when it comes to cryptocurrency markets, among other things. Pomp claims Wall Street is talking about Bitcoin again, because he has \u201csources\u201d regarding such matters. Most people will know Wall Street never stopped talking about Bitcoin, yet its influence on the price remains rather unclear at this time. Paul Bucklad has a very different view on Bitcoin, albeit from a more philosophical point of view. He expects Bitcoin to come out on top following the next major financial crisis, which will seemingly occur sooner rather than later. It will be interesting to see if BTC can get a nudge from such a calamity, although it seems unlikely any major shift would occur right away. Last but not least, Cryptomer would like to inform the world as to why people trade altcoins and \u201cshitcoins\u201d. The main purpose of doing so is to accumulate more Bitcoin, rather than actually believing in those alternative projects. There is nothing wrong with increasing one\u2019s Bitcoin holdings through any legitimate means, even if it involves trading some currencies which others wouldn\u2019t touch with a ten-foot pole. All of the signs indicate Bitcoin will hit $5,300 well before the day is over. The only question is whether or not that level can be sustained and eventually turned into a new support level. Assuming that will be the case, the bullish uptrend could reach higher values over the course of the weekend. For now, everyone has to patiently wait and see how things will evolve exactly.

The culprit is not hard to find, as Bitcoin\u2019s dip drags everything down with it. This drop below $5,300 is not entirely surprising over the course of the weekend, albeit it remains to be seen when the Bitcoin price will recover this time around. Despite a solid week of semi-bullish momentum, it seems Bitcoin has finally hit some sort of minor roadblock along the way. Although there is nothing to be overly concerned about yet, it is possible the losses may mount slightly over the next few hours. As long as BTC remains above $5,200, few people will express their concerns, as there is an equal chance the market will bounce back pretty quickly. To put this in perspective, the current Bitcoin price is down by 0.99% over the past 24 hours. A deficit nonetheless, although one that only brings the value down to $5,283. Although that level may not necessarily hold, it is not the major setback some traders had expected to materialize. As such, there is some hope BTC will reclaim the $5,300 level pretty quickly and continue its slow and steady uptrend accordingly, While looking at the price chart is most people\u2019s favorite pastime, there are plenty of other developments to keep an eye on as well. One more interesting tidbit of recent information has to do with LedgerX planning to offer physically settled Bitcoin futures contracts. It would be the first US-based firm to successfully do so, which is something worth keeping an eye on. AskMeHow is seemingly a Bitcoin Maximalist, as this user doesn\u2019t necessarily see much purpose for the majority of altcoins on the market today. In fact, he claims altcoins bleeding value is a bullish sign for Bitcoin in a way. It is not the first time such comments are uttered in the cryptoverse, although there will always be people who effectively oppose such thoughts. While accurate price predictions are very difficult to come by, Frank B Underwood expected Easter to turn into a bloody mess. So far, it seems this user hit the nail on the head, as all markets are bleeding value. Then again, any Sunday can trigger such momentum, thus it seems unlikely the Easter aspect of today has much to do with it. When everything is said and done, it seems plausible to assume Bitcoin\u2019s momentum will shift again over the course of the next few days. Although no big gains should be expected at this time, the current bearish pressure won\u2019t necessarily trigger major losses either. A blip on the radar, but seemingly nothing more than that.

In the bearish sense, Bitcoin might lose a bit of value and drag all alternative markets with it. So far, it seems there is no real pressure yet, as the $5,300 level remains ripe for the taking. This is positive Bitcoin price news, albeit weekends remain unpredictable. When the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency so much as dares to move an inch in either direction, there will be new price predictions being charted. Bitcoin has captivated a lot of traders\u2019 hearts, even though it is not moving up as swiftly as some people would like. Even so, it seems the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency shows no signs of weakness yet despite a very bearish hourly candle not that long ago. All things considered, there is no reason to be surprised where the current Bitcoin price is concerned. As was to be expected somewhat, the $5,300 level remains in place, although the actual struggle for control is still ongoing. This latest 0.07% gain brings the market one step closer to success, but it seems likely this battle will resume over the coming days. On social media, it would appear the opinions regarding Bitcoin continue to dominate the landscape. Mihai sees no reason for more people to run a full Bitcoin node, even though that would never be a bad thing either. It is certainly true not every Bitcoin user needs t do so, but those who feel the desire to run one shouldn\u2019t be discouraged either. A slightly different opinion is provided by Cryptomer, who is merely interested in the current and future price changes. It is certainly true everyone wants a major surge, yet it remains to be seen if and when things will play out accordingly. This user also refers to the real capitulation in the next quarter, albeit that might be a bit of an optimistic outlook. Please, who might have one of the more interesting Twitter handles in the cryptocurrency industry, wants an early Christmas present from the top crypto markets. That will primarily depend on how the value of Bitcoin evolves, thus it would make sense to pay a bit more attention to the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency. It will be difficult to predict where Bitcoin\u2019s price heads next. All signs seem to indicate there is bullish momentum in place, but it might not necessarily lead to any convincing value changes for any market.

As long as the Bitcoin price is in the green \u2013 like it is today \u2013 there is a good chance the uptrend will remain in place. Ever since BTC surpassed $5,300, things have continued to look up despite most traders\u2019 expectations. Most cryptocurrency traders and speculators are pretty happy to see the Bitcoin value move up despite the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency surpassing the $5,300 mark. Previous attempts at hitting this value and turning it into new stable support have been rather unsuccessful, yet it would appear this time around is a bit different. More specifically, it would seem the Bitcoin price has successfully increased by 0.5% in the past few hours. This allowed the value to hit $5,300, which is a very interesting price level for many different reasons. Bitcoin is hardly ever bullish over the weekend and often notes a small loss. This ongoing slow and steady uptrend offers a lot of hope for the future. On social media, there are a fair few interesting opinions on what Bitcoin is bringing to the table at this current price level. Keyvan Davani isn\u2019t necessarily concerned about the actual price, yet he does hope for accelerated adoption of Bitcoin. While it seems unlikely 3 billion people own part of a Bitcoin in the next five years, one never knows what the future will bring. HugeStackman has very high expectations for Bitcoin. This is primarily because all of his \u201ccolleagues\u201d seem to feel pretty bullish regarding the long term as well. When a lot of people think along the same lines, there is a real chance the market will effectively head in that particular direction. However, Bitcoin is a very unpredictable market first and foremost. As is usually the case, some people remain unconvinced Bitcoin will succeed in any size, shape, or form. OldPa sees no real chance of success for Bitcoin as long as it keeps getting forked. This also indicates he is convinced Bitcoin forks will never be \u201cstrong money\u201d. It is certainly true none of the major Bitcoin forks has proven to be too successful. For the time being, there is no reason to be remotely concerned about Bitcoin.

Some of the recent USD-based gains have been wiped out, primarily because of altcoins losing value over Bitcoin. The Litecoin price, while still clinging to the $80 support level, may see some bearish pressure as well in the coming hours. No one genuinely wants to see more bearish market momentum affecting the different cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets. The year 2018 has been incredibly bearish already, yet 2019 has offered a few glimpses of hope for a better future. That doesn\u2019t mean the markets are out of the woods yet by any means, as most of the altcoins are currently facing pressure where their BTC value is concerned. Those losses can offset some, if not all USD-based gains in pretty quick succession. As far as the Litecoin price is concerned, it would appear the $80 level is still in play. More specifically, it seems there is a 1.73% gain in USD value, which can be rather beneficial for this market in the long run. However, there is also a 0.82% loss in LTC/BTC, which doesn\u2019t bode too well for the immediate future either. Although this loss isn\u2019t insurmountable by any means, it would appear further bearish momentum can materialize in the near future. On social media, there are always many different discussions pertaining to cryptocurrencies, tokens, and digital assets. Master would like to know which market is the \u201cbetter Bitcoin Cash\u201d. A bit of an odd sentiment, as there is only one Bitcoin Cash right now. Claiming how Litecoin might be the better BCH seems a bit odd, although it all depends on how one is looking at the bigger picture when it comes to Bitcoin and alternative markets. While there are dozens of exchanges and trading platforms which allow for LTC trading right now, it would appear there are some options which often get overlooked. South Africa\u2019s ICE3x has enabled Litecoin trading some time ago and offers very low trading fees accordingly. There are also no deposit fees for both crypto and fiat transfers, which can make this exchange rather appealing to the right users. One rather peculiar image has been shared on Twitter which compares Bitcoin and Litecoin accordingly. While such comparisons are nothing new by any means, they often make little to no sense. Bitcoin and Litecoin are two very different projects which should not necessarily be seen as competitors. However, it would appear there is also an interesting reason for this comparison, as Eudy Zerpa wants to convince more people to pay attention to Litecoin. As the vast majority of alternative cryptocurrency markets are under a bit of pressure, the coming hours will either make or break some offerings accordingly. Even though Bitcoin itself is not under any real pressure just yet, a lot of alternatives are losing BTC value in fairly quick succession. How all of this will play out, remains to be determined, but the current trend indicates some minor losses are looming on the horizon. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

This is the direct result of Bitcoin losing value again, which usually causes major problems for alternative markets. So far, it seems as if the Bitcoin SV price is getting hit the hardest, as its valued dropped well below $60 rather quickly. Ever since its inception, Bitcoin SV has caused a fair bit of controversy in quick succession. It is widely considered to be a \u201cshitcoin\u201d by the community, although that hasn\u2019t prevented the project from seeing some minor successes along the way. However, it would appear most of that positive momentum has come to an end, as there is a genuine \u201cDelistSV\u201d campaign occurring in the industry as a whole. This has caused a massive Bitcoin SV price collapse, which is only to be expected. More specifically, there is a 22% loss in USD value, as one BSV is now priced at just $56.28. There is also a 20.65% loss in BSV/BTC, as the ratio dipped to 0.011 Bitcoin. Neither of these trends look very appealing, but it seems the genuine pressure may not relent anytime soon either. Multiple platforms have now delisted SV, which will undoubtedly cause even more price pressure in the very near future. On social media, the big news is how Binance has delisted Bitcoin SV as a trading market. Not because of a client update or a network issue, but rather because the show has seemingly run its course. ShapeShift has also confirmed they will remove this altcoin from their platform in the coming hours. It seems unlikely all exchanges and trading platforms will do so right away, but it creates an interesting point of discussion regardless. Some people are also targeting the people who have seemingly stood by Bitcoin SV for quite some time now. Nguyen Loc is poking fun at Calvin Ayre and how he keeps defending Bitcoin SV and its team even during this troublesome period. It is certainly true no one is capable of preventing people from selling Bitcoin SV on exchanges, other than the exchanges themselves effectively delisting this trading market. A very interesting week lies ahead in this regard, although the outcome may not please everyone. Vegard Wikeby isn\u2019t too bothered by this by all of these developments. Instead, he is also proposing a solution to address the current delisting process. Launching a North America Bitcoin BSV Exchange only with CAD, USD, and MXN trading pairs would certainly be an intriguing development. Whether or not it can happen and be successful, is a very different matter altogether. When it comes to looking at the bigger picture, it would seem rather unlikely things will improve for Bitcoin SV in the coming hours. A 22% drop is a major setback, but one has to keep in mind this can easily grow a lot worse in very quick succession. While the trading volume looks good, the market cap of Bitcoin SV has now officially dropped below $1bn already.

More specifically, this forked version of Bitcoin Cash is currently getting removed from numerous exchanges, trading platforms, and companies accepting it as a payment method. As this list continues to grow, one has to wonder how the future of BSV will look. Several exchanges have already confirmed they will remove Bitcoin SV in the coming days and weeks. The first platform to do so was Binance, as its owner has taken a very harsh stance against the project and its \u201cmouthpieces\u201d, so to speak. While Bitcoin SV has always been a controversial fork, it seemed as if every exchange was more than willing to give it a fair chance. That positive momentum has now evaporated altogether. Not entirely surprising, although the speed at which these changes are enforced might raise some questions accordingly. Binance is not the only big exchange trying to get rid of BSV these days. Kraken, while initially on the fence about this decision, has now confirmed they are delisting this altcoin as well. The Twitter poll saw a clear vote in favor of removing BSV, as 71% of respondents want to see it gone. Another 22% of users commented they \u201cdon\u2019t care either way\u201d, which shows this discussion is not something affecting all cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Another exchange removing Bitcoin SV support is Bittylicious in the United Kingdom. The company claims BSV will be delisted due to low trading volume and \u201cshowing solidarity against the toxic litigious environment in the BSV space\u201d. A very strong negative sentiment toward this forked version of Bitcoin Cash, to say the very least. The bigger question is how many other exchanges will effectively follow suit. The #DelistSV campaign on Twitter is in full effect, albeit a lot of service providers have to make their position clear. Satowallet, a lesser-known multi-asset exchange, has also confirmed they will remove BSV support fairly soon. The company wants to \u201cstart cleaning up the crypto community\u201d. BitForex is currently running a Twitter poll to determine their course of action. Most of the replies favor getting rid of Bitcoin SV, at the time of writing. While getting removed from exchanges is a major blow to Bitcoin SV, several service providers are taking a similar course of action. ShapeShift has confirmed it is removing BSV support as of today, which means users will no longer be able to obtain this altcoin through the platform. Its competitors have seemingly not taken any definitive course of action at this time, thus there may be some interesting developments up ahead in this regard. The Blockchain wallet team is also ending support in a month from now. The company already offered very limited BSV support, butt hat feature will soon come to an end. While the company never clarifies its decision, it seems they are simply following the overall trend. The same applies to Phantasma Chain, as this project originally planned to support Bitcoin SV as part of its Cosmic Swaps solution. That will no longer be the case moving forward.", "date": "2019-04-17T08:06:46+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 17}

As has been the case today, the uneasy momentum triggered some losses for several alternative markets. Even so, the Bitcoin price itself is still holding up quite well. A push to $5,200 seems plausible, but it might not happen anytime soon. Any cryptocurrency enthusiasts will be happy to see Bitcoin in the green on any given day. More often than not, that is a sign there is little to no bearish pressure to speak of. If there is one thing most traders, investors, and speculators have seen plenty of, it is the bearish pressure wreaking havoc on all markets. For now, everything seems to be in order, although things can change on a dime. With a positive Bitcoin trend, all other markets get a bit of a breather as well. Over the past 24 hours, the Bitcoin price has risen by another 1.45%. Not the most impressive gain by any means, but it shows the current uptrend can be sustained without too many problems at this time. That is all one can ask for, after all. With a current price of $5,174, it seems Bitcoin may attempt to reach $5,200 again at some point this week. Whether or not that will be a successful attempt, is a very different matter altogether. On social media, there is never any lack of animosity toward Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Today, however, it seems everyone is cautiously optimistic first and foremost, which is rather indicative as to what the future may hold. Mr. Hodler tells people to stay calm and look at as the \u201clong term trust\u2019, whatever that might mean. Keeping the long-term picture in mind is always a favorable approach when dealing with volatile markets. A somewhat similar sentiment is echoed by HAU, although this user doesn\u2019t mind taking things one step further. In fact, he claims it is irresponsible to not own Bitcoin by now, which may be a bit of a stretch. While there is some merit to this statement as well, it seems irresponsible to guide people toward Bitcoin if they have zero clue what they are getting themselves into. For those who want a Bitcoin chart to gaze at, there is a lot of interesting momentum playing out. Peter Sin Guili informs the masses this is far from a bull market as of right now, which may effectively indicate there are some rough times ahead. Although it wouldn\u2019t take too much to push this market into perma-bull territory, making it happen has been pretty difficult for quite some time now. As long as Bitcoin remains in the green, there isn\u2019t too much to be overly concerned about. At the same time, one should always be wary as to what the future may hold, as there is no such thing as a continuous trend in either direction. While it seems to be a matter of time until Bitcoin hits $5,200 once again, there is always a chance something will spark a sudden run when people least expect it.

Some see every minor weakness as a big problem, whereas others simply keep the faith in hope of better momentum to materialize. It is unclear where this market will head over the coming hours and days, but no major dip should occur under these circumstances. More specifically, the Bitcoin price is still up by 0.66% over the past 24 hours, It is not the biggest change by any means, yet it seems there were slightly bigger gains just a few hours ago.

Digital Mine would like to remind people Bitcoin is still in an uptrend despite the bearish year 2018 has turned out to be. Buying 100 Euro worth of Bitcoin in 2013 would have yielded 4,772.89 Euro at this time and the same amount of Bitcoin to boot. It is always intriguing to see how these market prices fluctuate over time. Kee, on the other hand, expects no bearish pressure to materialize for Bitcoin now or in the coming days. More specifically, he expects a price increase to $6,000, albeit that seems rather unlikely given the current trend. Over time, it will most likely reach that milestone again, but no one knows for sure when it will happen exactly. When looking at the big picture, it will be interesting to see how Bitcoin\u2019s value evolves exactly. The $5,000 level should not come under any real pressure, but a push to $5,300 has proven to be rather challenging in recent weeks. It would not be too surprising to see the price ping-pong between those two levels for a little while longer. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Whether or not further gains will be realized, is difficult to predict as anything remains possible under these circumstances. Right now, the Bitcoin price sits above $5.200 again, yet a push to $5,300 remains rather unlikely. This morning, it almost seemed as if Bitcoin would drop below $5,000 again and usher in another wave of bearish pressure. Several hours later it almost seems as if this dip never occurred in the first place. No one can claim cryptocurrency markets are boring in any way, albeit they often fail to make any real sense. Today is no different in that regard, but in a positive manner. As of right now, the Bitcoin price sits at $5.212 and shows signs it may continue to inch higher in the hours to come. This 3.08% increase is already quite impressive given the current circumstances. For now, it would appear BTC happily bounces between $5,000 and $5,250 without any signs of going much higher. It is interesting to keep an eye on, as speculators make some good money playing this range. On social media, there is still plenty of debate whether or not Bitcoin SV\u2019s recent delistings have any impact on the BTC price, It would be odd to state there is n correlation between these developments. PJ Grube still remains a firm believer of Bitcoin SV, even though the price trend clearly disagrees with him. A curious turn of events which will continue to shake things up on social media for some time to come. Tristan Night, on the other hand, is happy to see Bittylicious follow the lead set by Binance by removing Bitcoin SV from its platform altogether. Some people will argue this process should have occurred on the day this fork was created. However, something has caused major exchanges to take this action now, of all times. It seems to correlate with the Bitcoin value increase, albeit that might be a mere coincidence. Other than BTC price discussions, it would appear some people still see the merit of what Bitcoin represents. ABitcoin.blog highlights the cross-border payment nature of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency. It is a feature people often tend to overlook during these times, although some people are still drawn to Bitcoin simply because of its potential in the payments space. For the time being, it is difficult to determine what will happen to the Bitcoin value in the next 24 hours. A continuation of the current trend would be a more than favorable outcome for everyone, although there is a limit as to how high the price can go right now. Surpassing $5,300 in a decisive manner may prove to be a bridge too far, albeit nothing is impossible in this industry. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

In recent years, most of the news has been negative, which won\u2019t surprise too many people. In the most recent development, it would appear China\u2019s state planner wants to put an official end to Bitcoin mining in the country. It is one of several dozen activities to be \u201cblacklisted\u2019 in the country. Ever since Bitcoin trading in China took a big hit due to new regulatory measures, the country has continued its effort to thwart any cryptocurrency activity. While those efforts have seen varying degrees of success, any hint at banning Bitcoin-related activity usually drives the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency\u2019s price down as a result. This most recent development may trigger a very similar effect, although it remains to be seen how things will play out in this regard. China\u2019s state planner has submitted a new draft proposal which will legally put an end to Bitcoin mining. Not entirely surprising, as China has begun weeding out most of the Bitcoin mining operations in the country over the past two years. This new proposal, however, seems to indicate Bitcoin mining does \u201cnot adhere to relevant laws and regulation, or wastes resources\u201d. It seems the latter angle will be the main reason for this approach, albeit no one ever knows for sure how government officials think when it comes to cryptocurrency activity. It is also worth noting this new proposal does not just revolve around Bitcoin mining either. A revised list or industries to be restricted or eliminated has been produced. It now encompasses over 450 activities, which is a vast increase compared to its previous iteration published back in 2011. It is only normal some changes are made in that regard, and the growing dislike toward Bitcoin has been well-documented as well. What is rather interesting is how there is no official date as to when these changes could go into effect. The Chinese public has the option to comment on this new proposal from now until May 7 of 2019. It will be interesting to see how things will evolve in that regard, as the public may take somewhat of a stance against some of these future restrictions. Even so, after the comment period comes to an end, there is still no official indication as to when the proposed changes would go in effect or how they will be enforced exactly. The big question is whether this news will trigger a wave of bearish Bitcoin price pressure again. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency recently broke the $5,000 resistance numerous times in a successful manner, although there may be a sharp retrace following this news. However, China hasn\u2019t played much of a role of importance in the Bitcoin industry for many years now. Most of the news coming out of that country will not affect the overall market trend for an extended period of time. Another potential consequence to take into account is how most of the Bitcoin mining hardware is produced and operated in China. As such, this potential upcoming ban could have some big consequences in that regard, although it is still too early to draw any real conclusions in this regard. It is evident China wants to distance itself from cryptocurrency in every way possible, and this new proposal is a clear example of making that vision come true in the near future.", "date": "2019-04-09T08:11:51+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 9}

While some altcoin maximalists will gladly claim otherwise, it is evident that is not the case. As such, a positive Bitcoin price trend is of the utmost importance. So far, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency appears to be on the right track, although the road ahead could be bumpy. With a positive Bitcoin trend, the rest of the cryptocurrency markets will usually see some form of promising momentum. If Bitcoin\u2019s trend falls apart, the altcoins will bleed value pretty quickly. So far, it seems as if Bitcoin shows no signs of slowing down just yet. However, there is also a ceiling as to how high the price can go at this time, as $5,300 seems to offer plenty of resistance along the way. That particular value may not be reached for some time to come, depending on how the market evolves exactly. Over the past 24 hours, the Bitcoin price has risen by 0.95%, which is not all that impressive. In fact, it is not the trend most people had hoped for, as they want to see a jump to $6,000 pretty quickly. For now, Bitcoin\u2019s value seems to bounce between $5,000 and $5,250, with no real indication that latter level will be broken in a decisive manner. Despite noting more than solid trading volume worth $13.815bn, it seems the market is at a status quo at this time. On social media, most people are a bit unsure as to what the Bitcoin momentum will offer exactly. For the time being, the bull return hinted at by Gabo is still not in place, although no one will deny Bitcoin\u2019s value has risen significantly compared to January of 2019. Sustaining that level of growth has been the main problem for all cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets to date, thus it seems rather unlikely anything major will change in that regard moving forward. PAHMPIT is not too bothered by the recent China news regarding the banning of Bitcoin mining. It is evident China plays far less of a role of importance when it comes to the BTC value these days. In terms of mining, this \u201cproposed ban\u201d can shake things up a bit, but since it has not been approved or turned into law yet, this matter should not make much of an impact overall. MASH, on the other hand, would like to plan ahead in terms of a financial future and see Bitcoin rise to the top in the process. It will be interesting to see how that vision turns out, as pretty much everyone would like to retire on Bitcoin in the next few months. For now, that seems rather unlikely, but one never knows how the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency\u2019s price may look in a year or five from today. Considering how other other markets will stand or fall based on how Bitcoin performs, the current market momentum doesn\u2019t necessarily bode all that well. While Bitcoin is not necessarily in grave danger as of right now, it seems the temporary uptrend may slowly grind to a halt once again. No major dips are expected in this regard either, but there is definitely some sense of unease as of right now. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

To start off this week, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is still going strong, as the Bitcoin price sits at $5,230. While there is some minor bearish pressure to contend with, it seems the $5,000 level will remain in place for at least another day. It is always difficult to make any accurate predictions where Bitcoin is concerned Although this currency is the market trend setter first and foremost, it is also pretty fickle even under the best of circumstances. In the past few days, Bitcoin has shown numerous bullish signs, although there has also been some sort of a retrace just prior to the weekend. Kicking off this new week on a high note is vital to keep the momentum going, and so far, it seems everything is in order. To put this in perspective, the Bitcoin price has gained 1.64% in the past 24 hours. With a current price point of $5,233.87, it would appear there is nothing to worry about just yet. One has to be careful on Mondays, though, as there is always a good chance some traders will take minor profits and wait for a lower price level to buy back in. Some bearish pressure is forming on the hourly chart, but nothing too serious at the time of writing. On social media, the expectations are quite steep as far as Bitcoin is concerned. Dutch_Patience expects a continuation of this bull run until BTC hits at least $5,700. It will take some time to reach that level, as it would require another 10% price increase. Considering how the $5,000 level needs to be beefed up to act as solid support first, it seems unlikely such a steep price increase will materialize in the coming days. WolfofMillions also has very high expectations for Bitcoin in the coming months. Predicting a price point of $15,000 or more by late 2019 seems very optimistic, even with the most recent price increase. Moreover, this user expects a new all-time high of up to $60,000 by mid-2020. Very optimistic outlooks, although nothing is impossible in this rather volatile industry. Last but not least, there simply is a lot of optimism among cryptocurrency enthusiast snow that Bitcoin has risen in value again. Q.D is happy with the current price, as it feels like when Bitcoin was at nearly $20,000. It seems some traders are happy pretty quickly these days, but that is not necessarily a bad thing either. Most people want to see this currency return to the $19,000 levels sooner rather than later, though. All things considered, there is a chance Bitcoin will see some negative price momentum in the near future. Mondays are rather notorious for some bearish pressure, especially where the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is concerned. A drop below $5,000 seems unlikely, albeit the $5,200 level may face some big pressure in the hours to come. Another interesting day of cryptocurrency trading lies ahead, by the look of things.

In most cases, it is a futile effort to make any accurate predictions in this regard. Everything stands or falls based on the Bitcoin price, which is still subjected to rather uncertain momentum right now. This doesn\u2019t bode all that well for the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency. While the altcoins are trying to recover some of their lost value as of right now, it is evident the effort will not be without its own hurdles. As long as Bitcoin remains in the green, altcoins will usually benefit. However, the question is whether or not Bitcoin will effectively remain in the green for long. Right now, that doesn\u2019t necessarily appear to be the case. When looking back at the most recent Bitcoin price momentum, things are not looking all that great. While the 0.35% gain is still in place, it may not be sufficient to warrant any sort of optimism right now. Bitcoin\u2019s overall trading volume is also on the decline right now, as just $14m worth of BTC has changed hands. All of these signs seem to confirm more bearish pressure is around the corner. On social media, there is some concern regarding the launch of Float SV While this has nothing to do with Bitcoin per se, this Bitcoin SV exchange is made possible with the help of OKEx. This could lead to very volatile market swings all across the board, as the Bitcoin SV team may be planning to mount another attempt at overtaking Bitcoin in the long run. Christopher DiSanto would like to remind the cryptocurrency users of how two important block halvings are coming up soon. While he mainly focuses on the Litecoin event, there is also a Bitcoin halving in just over a year from today. Depending on how LTC\u2019s halving affects the price, some similar momentum may materialize where Bitcoin is concerned in 2020. It doesn\u2019t happen all that often a Bitcoin meme makes the rounds on social media. Today is one of those rare exceptions, as Crypto Millionaire has identified the killer app for Bitcoin. It is a very crude image, but one has to keep in mind there is some truth to this concept as well. At the least, it brings a chuckle to many faces, which is always a good thing. When it comes to Bitcoin, there is never any real indication as to where the value will head next. Any sort of momentum can materialize in quick succession. Right now, it sees the market leans toward the bearish side of the spectrum, albeit weekends can offer some surprising trends more often than not.

In the United States, that scrutiny is even bigger compared to most other countries around the world. One 22-year-old Bitcoin trader has now been sentenced to two years in prison and forfeiting financial assets for trading and selling Bitcoin in an unlicensed manner. Ever since Bitcoin started making media headlines, people have been looking for ways to make money with the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency. Even today, making money can be done in many different ways. Depending on one\u2019s jurisdiction, some of the more profitable options are best left untouched. For Jacob Burrell Campos, the buying and selling of Bitcoin made him good money, but also granted him a two-year prison sentence in the process. Following his arrest in August of 2018, Campos decided to plead guilty to operating a Bitcoin exchange without registering with FinCEN. As most people are aware of by now, Bitcoin is still largely unregulated in the US, but companies facilitating the buying and selling of this currency will need to obtain an official money transmitter license. Campos decided not to adhere to this requirement, which ultimately led to his arrest. He also confirmed there was no AML safeguard implemented during his operations, which only makes the situation worse. Because of him pleading guilty, Campos had to wait on the final verdict. One of the first orders of business was ensuring he forfeited the illicit profits. The amount of money to pay up was set at $823,357, which shows this \u201cexchange\u2019 had been in operation for quite some time. Earlier this week, the final sentence was handed down. This 22-year-old will serve two years in prison for operating an unlicensed money transmitter business. Given the scale of his operations, that sentence could have been far more severe. Campos mainly accepted payments in cash or through MoneyGram, after which he deposited the money into an account on Bitfinex to purchase the required amount of Bitcoin on behalf of his clients. A total of $3.29m worth of Bitcoin was purchased through his account between 2015 and 2017. It was not his first foray into buying and flipping Bitcoin either, as he previously used an unnamed licensed US-based Bitcoin exchange. That trading account was closed eventually, which forced him to rely on Bitfienx more and more. While this arrest and subsequent sentencing will irate some Bitcoin enthusiasts, it is evident this is not the first time an unlicensed Bitcoin trader gets in trouble. Numerous individuals have been arrested and sentenced to jail for similar business practices. While the allure of selling Bitcoin for a profit to individuals who have no idea how to approach this industry can yield decent profits, it is not something one should do on such a large scale. If one has the ambition to run a full-fledged exchange, registering with the proper authorities is a must. The demand for Bitcoin has seemingly not slowed down in recent years. Despite the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency losing a lot of value since late 2017, the overall trading volume recorded through exchange APIs has not seen any real decline. Additionally, platforms such as LocalBitcoins and even OTC trading are becoming a lot more popular. There are also vast quantities of trading volume which are not officially tracked by data aggregators. Decentralized trading solutions will only further influence the trading of Bitcoin on a global scale. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

That is only normal, as this market dictates the pace for all other cryptocurrency markets as well. As Bitcoin is now subjected to some uncertain momentum, the mid-term price predictions are becoming all the more relevant. The following predictions show things can get pretty interesting, although not everyone will agree with these outlooks. For the past few weeks, it would appear a lot of cryptocurrency users claimed the bear market is finally over. When looking at today\u2019s price chart, it seems that may not necessarily be the case just yet, although this latest dip doesn\u2019t seem to be too severe either. EXCAVO had taken this dip into consideration, as this user claims it is part of the ongoing uptrend. Achieving the $5,000 level has been a big success, but it quickly became apparent there would be some negative price pressure in the weeks afterward as well. When looking at this mid-term and long-term Bitcoin price chart, however, there may be a lot of more momentum to look forward to. It seems there will be no further big retrace as the price pushes through to $29,000 in the coming months. That is a very optimistic outlook first and foremost, but it is not necessarily impossible to reach either. Further down the line, this trader expects one Bitcoin to be valued at $89,000 by 2022 or 2023, which would be something to look forward to. Depending on how much one stares at the Bitcoin price chart, different patterns may begin taking shape. According to Botje11, it seems the dip $4,600 will not materialize in the end, as there has been a lot more buying support than originally anticipated. It also seems Bitcoin broke through the $5,250 level in a semi-convincing manner, albeit holding on to those gains has proven to be rather difficult. This leaves a lot of wiggle room on the table, as determining the next pattern to form will be rather challenging. If there is one thing to take away from the current market trend, it is how the bulls will attempt to remain in control for quite some time to come. The uptrend is still in place, but it is also taking quite some time to move up to a higher level in the process. As such, it seems there will be either a real bull flag pattern forming, or a FOMO triangle. Either one could prove to be beneficial to Bitcoin in many different ways, although this market will remain unpredictable first and foremost. For those traders who like to zoom in up close on their Bitcoin charts, the prediction shared by IgorPorokh will undoubtedly catch a lot of attention. This user expects a Bitcoin rising flag pennant to come into play, and he has the signs to back up this claim. More specifically, the market has broken out recently and seems to reach higher values after every small or medium-sized dip. That is something most traders cannot refute, even though the price has ping-ponged a bit as of late. Even so, as the upward momentum carries over, it seems to be a matter of time until another decisive breakout takes shake. Right now, there is no indication another major BTC price push will materialize, although one never knows what the future will hold in the process. Assuming this chart comes true, however, there may be a lot of promising momentum in the coming days and weeks. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

If this is indeed a continuation of the uptrend, a lot of interesting things will happen over the weekend. Contrary to what people might expect, it seems the Bitcoin Diamond price is moving up rather quickly again. A very unusual trend, considering how BCD doesn\u2019t necessarily serve any real purpose. It has been a while since anyone even talked about Bitcoin Diamond. This self-professed \u201cbetter version of Bitcoin\u2019 has not made the biggest impact nor a lasting impression on the cryptocurrency community since its inception. That is primarily because BCD doesn\u2019t necessarily seem to introduce or address any use cases where Bitcoin might be lacking right now. It also seems highly unlikely that situation will change moving forward, as Bitcoin Diamond is a very odd market first and foremost Over the past 24 hours, the market momentum has seemingly shifted in favor of Bitcoin Diamond. Because of a very strong uptrend, one BCD is now valued at $1.32. The Bitcoin Diamond price gained 15.7% in USD value and 15.4% over Bitcoin, both of which are pretty impressive in their own regard. As is rather unusual for this altcoin, its trading volume seems more than respectable for a change. Sustaining this rate of growth will be quite difficult, though. Perhaps the oddest development involving BCD is how its price on Huobi Global is seven times higher compared to any other exchange. That in itself doesn\u2019t bode well for this altcoin market by any means, although it seems Coinmarketcap isn\u2019t even keeping tabs on this particular price. It is a clear sign of how this is an artificial pump first and foremost, although there is still good money to be made regardless. It seems this sudden turn of events has a lot of people excited, which is only to be expected. Crypto BamBii expects big things from Bitcoin Diamond, although it seems most of the uptrend is already in place. Noting further gains will be very difficult under these circumstances, although it is not necessarily impossible either. Reaching the Huobi Global price of $8.4 will be pretty much impossible, though. As is always the case when an altcoin market rises in value for no apparent reason, there will be some market arbitrage options to look into as well. For Bitcoin Diamond, there is a direct arbitrage option to explore between Binance and HitBTC. It offers a more than respectable profit of up to 8%, although that gap will not necessarily remain in place for very long. Either because BCD will lose value, or because the gap will close itself due to traders taking advantage. With most of the cryptocurrency markets entering the bullish stage once again, there is plenty of exciting momentum to look forward to in the near future. How things will play out for Bitcoin Diamond, is very difficult to predict. There is a good chance this market will begin heading down again after this bullish surge. Markets are always unpredictable first and foremost, and BCD will not be an exception by any means. Even so, the coming hours and days may surprise a lot of people when everything is said and done.

This is primarily because the Bitcoin price is plummeting all of a sudden with no real improvement in sight. The hourly charts look very bearish, thus it seems likely the $4,750 level will not remain in place for very long, assuming this trend continues. It was somewhat to be expected Bitcoin would not rally for very long until things got dire again. Any market needs a correction after sustaining either strong gains or severe losses. For the time being, Bitcoin is still up by over 19% in the past seven days, although there are notable losses to take note of. It may be a prelude of what is yet to come, although predicting this market will always be challenging. When looking at the total damage, it quickly becomes apparent the losses are quite significant. A 4,77% loss in USD value drives the Bitcoin price down to $4,888. It is not necessarily the lowest level some people had expected by now, but it remains to be seen at which value this negative spiral will end up at. Despite $20.5bn in trading volume, a sudden reversal seems rather unlikely. When looking across social media, it quickly becomes evident some traders saw this downtrend coming and cashed out well in advance. Anton took profit at $5.345 and simply exited his Bitcoin position in search of a new buying opportunity. As such, it seems this trader will keep a close eye on the BTC chart and make a purchase once things have begun settling down again. Cryptomunity tries to keep a positive attitude toward the current price momentum. More specifically, this user hopes Bitcoin is preparing for a new breakout. While it is understandable someone may be thinking along those lines, the big breakout occurred just days ago. History can repeat itself, but in such quick succession would be remarkable, even for Bitcoin. Finding any reliable technical analysis for Bitcoin is not necessarily an easy feat right now. This market is very volatile and can easily swing in any direction on the hourly chart. For now, it seems the bearish pressure remains. Philakone expects BTC to bottom out near $4.6k, or at least $4.4k as a worst-case scenario. All of the other cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets will continue to bleed value as long as Bitcoin\u2019s price remains bearish. At the time of writing, a reversal is highly unlikely, although some of the losses may be recovered if things go well. There is no reason to panic either, as this dip is entirely expected after a few days of significant price growth.

Although Bitcoin is still in the green, it dropped below $5,000 once again. Interestingly enough, the Bitcoin Cash price sees this as a signal to turn bullish yet again. Most of its gains are still intact, and it seems the $300 level will hold true for some time to come. It is evident the current overall market momentum isn\u2019t too promising as far as most altcoins, tokens, and assets are concerned. This momentum will always be subjected to change, but as Bitcoin dropped below $5,000 again, most of the positivity has been eroded in the process. Interestingly enough, it would appear Bitcoin Cash shows no signs of slowing down by any means. Despite noting over 70% gains in the past few days, it is still going strong even when Bitcoin is coming under a lot of pressure. To put everything in perspective, the Bitcoin Cash price has gained another 11.5% in both USD and BTC value today. This pushes the current price to $304.51, or 0.061 Bitcoin. Very promising trends when looking at the bigger picture, although it will be interesting to see how long all of this can be sustained for. The BCH trading volume is also picking up steam, as nearly $4bn worth of BCH has changed hands across the exchanges in the past day. The big news of the day is how Huobi DM will launch Bitcoin Cash contracts, according to Crypto Sarah. This new feature is expected to become available tomorrow, and users will also be able to leverage their position. It is another offering to bring more exposure to Bitcoin Cash as a whole, although it may not necessarily have an impact on the BCH value itself. Even so, it is another notch in the belt of this ecosystem, which is always a good sign. For those who keep a close eye on the BCH chart as of right now, there is a lot of interesting potential waiting to be unlocked. If this uptrend continues, it seems BCH will finally break out of the downward spiral in a decisive manner, which will make a lot of traders rather happy. As is always the case, though, there is a genuine chance things will not work out as planned, as it will mainly depend on how dire the Bitcoin price situation gets. Xloutpa seems to share a similar sentiment when it comes to Bitcoin Cash. More specifically, there is a big \u201cgap\u201d waiting to be filled in terms of reaching a potential new all-time high further down the line. For now, that remains well out of reach despite the bullish momentum in place right now. With the weekend not too far off, it would appear this market can easily swing either way in quick succession. At this time, it is evident Bitcoin Cash performs better than most other markets as of right now. Its gains are still in place as of right now, and the trading volume continues to rise every single day. How that will affect the value, is a different matter altogether. Sustaining the $300 level should not necessarily be a problem, although one never knows what the future may bring. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Hourly charts start to look very bearish once again, although the daily chart is still pretty solid right now. The Bitcoin Cash price is still going strong at this time, as the $320 level is well within reach. When the Bitcoin price begins noting some strong gains, altcoins will either follow suit or crumble under the pressure. While many people may not necessarily like or agree with what Bitcoin Cash represents, the current value of this altcoin cannot be ignored. After nearly a week of solid gains, it has surpassed $250 and $300 in quick succession without looking back. Over the past 24 hours, the Bitcoin Cash price rose by another 10%, as it is now valued at $321.33. There is also another 7.15% increase in BCH/BTC, as this ratio remains incredibly bullish lately. One BCH is now priced at 0.0622 BTC, which will be of great interest to traders looking to increase their Bitcoin holdings in the process. It is rather apparent the current uptrend is not all that surprising either. As Greg Geiger confirms, this current increase is the result of a bullish hourly candle and a continuation of the trend which materialized earlier in the week. Keeping this momentum alive for a few more hours or days will prove to be somewhat challenging, but given the current success rate, there is nothing to be overly concerned about just yet. MyCryptoHustle is a firm believer of bigger and better things to come where Bitcoin Cash is concerned. These past few days have been incredibly bullish for BCH, and every minor dip has been bought up rather quickly. While the market is still a long way removed from its all-time high, this trend seems to confirm an extended bullish period may come into play for all markets. For those traders who zoom in on charts, the current uptrend may look scary more than anything else. More specifically, this sudden and steep uptrend over the past few days has not been met with any real resistance. A correction will occur eventually though, albeit it is very hard to predict when that will happen exactly. When looking at the bigger picture, it is good to see all of the top markets move up at the same time. Whether or not it will lead to a major downfall in the near future, is anyone\u2019s guess. This week\u2019s minor bearish momentum triggered a bit of a panic, although the losses have been recovered without too many problems. Bitcoin Cash is performing rather well, but it too depends on Bitcoin\u2019s trend first and foremost.0 Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

After a minor wobble a few days ago, it seems the $5,000 level has been recaptured successfully. It is interesting to see a resilient Bitcoin price trend, as that is something people haven\u2019t seen much of in the past 18 months. No cryptocurrency enthusiasts will be dismayed by how the markets are developing in the past few weeks. All of this positive momentum has made people some good money, although there is also a sense of unease. Big gains hardly ever go without a steep correction, especially where Bitcoin and altcoins are concerned. For now, however, the bulls remain firmly in control which is all one can ask for. To put this in perspective, the past day has netted another 3.13% Bitcoin price increase. As such, one BTC is now priced at $5.185, which is a rather interesting level. Combined with nearly $17bn in trading volume \u2013 on a Saturday \u2013 it seems there is no market reversal in sight as of yet. There is always a chance the market will struggle a bit, but no major changes are expected at this time. As one would come to expect from this market momentum, it draws out everyone who has ever heard the term \u201cBitcoin\u201d in their life. Frank B Underwood isn\u2019t too pleased with all of the \u201cpermabull\u201d talks, simply because Bitcoin gained slightly over $120 in quick succession. It is evident this current price level is not a permabull sign by any means, albeit it does offer some hope. It is also interesting to see how well Bitcoin is performing across all of the exchanges. With the value fluctuating between $5,129 and $5,225, it would appear this is not an April Fool\u2019s Joke or blatant pump attempt by any means. The next level will be $5,500 which may prove to be a lot more difficult to achieve when everything is said and done. For those merely interested in the Bitcoin chart, the coming hours may prove rather interesting in many different ways. If Bitcoin fails to break the next resistance level, a temporary retrace is not necessarily impossible. It would not be a steep price change by any means, although there is always a chance the market will take traders by surprise. As the weekend trucks along, it would appear the Bitcoin value should remain above $5,000 without too many problems. The trading volume is very impressive, especially for a Saturday. Only time will tell if that is sufficient to keep this party going a little while longer. Nothing is ever certain in cryptocurrency, especially not the price of Bitcoin.

A bit of a correction has never hurt any market although some altcoins are more susceptible to declines than others. The EOS price is quickly giving up ground, as the value has dropped below $5.5 once again. It is no abnormal for top altcoins to deal with minor setbacks over the weekend. This particular weekend has proven to be rather bullish in general, which makes the current overarching bearish sentiment all the more normal. When Bitcoin starts to slip, altcoins often face much bigger losses in quick succession. EOS is an interesting example in this regard, although the dip isn\u2019t insurmountable. To put this in perspective, the EOS price dropped by 29% to $5.42. There is also a 2.43% dip in EOS/BTC, which is the main reason for this slightly steeper downtrend. When Bitcoin goes in the red, altcoins not only lose USD value, but they also drop against Bitcoin. Today is no different in that regard, although the dip creates investment opportunities for other people willing to take a gamble. As far as EOS is concerned, there is some interesting social media activity right now. DEXBot highlights a feature which is expected to come to EOS in the very near future. Known as Automated Lost Key Recovery, it can be a game changer in the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. It is not yet available, but it seems the development is progressing nicely. Secondly, it seems the EOS ecosystem is firing on all cylinders in terms of processing \u201cnetwork actions\u201d. With a record of 87.23 million actions processed in a single day, the network is well ahead of its competitors and other major cryptocurrencies right now. Even so, this statistic will not have much of an impact on the price in the near future. The price chart is of major interest to a lot of EOS holders and speculators. As of right now, it seems a triple top has been reached on the EOS/ETH chart, which could explain why this market is more bearish than Bitcoin. Additionally, it doesn\u2019t bode well for the next few days, albeit it remains to be seen if there will be any major disruptions. When looking at the bigger picture, it seems likely most markets will look very different 24 hours from now. Only time will tell whether that will be for better or worse, as either option is still more than plausible at this stage. For EOS holders, there is no real reason to panic, but there may be a bumpy ride up ahead. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Bitcoin Cash doesn\u2019t suffer from that problem, as it remains the most bullish market in the top 20. As the current Bitcoin Cash price sits above $250, it will be interesting to see where things head next. When Bitcoin remains this bullish for several days on end, it is a matter of time until the altcoins come under a lot of pressure. Not because they will note real losses because of dumps, but primarily because their ratio over Bitcoin is struggling so much it can negate the USD-based gains. Bitcoin Cash is one of the few coins which remains incredibly bullish in both USD and BTC terms, which is always interesting to keep an eye on. More specifically, the past 24 hours have resulted in major gains for BCH. A 39.8% push in USD value brings the current Bitcoin Cash price to $252.96. There is also a 32.3% rise in BCH/BTC, which elevates the ratio to 0.05115 Bitcoin. Very solid trends all across the board, which are facilitated by the overall trading volume surge affecting all markets. Bitcoin Cash hasn\u2019t noted $2.527bn in trades for some time now, but today seems to be a good day for this altcoin after all. As one would come to expect from such a sea of green candles, a lot of people expect the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d to be fully over at this time. Renata Nifield falls into this category, even though there is still plenty of bearish momentum that can materialize at any given moment. Since no one knows why the markets are moving up or why the trading volume has quadrupled, anything remains possible under these circumstances. It didn\u2019t take long before this BCH uptrend started spewing conspiracy theories regarding Bitcoin and Blockstream as well. Fox0 illustrates how \u201cBlockstream killed Bitcoin\u201d and \u201cBlockstream is holding back Bitcoin adoption for the second time\u201d at this time. Very odd statement considering Bitcoin is seemingly doing quite well on its own. Moreover, Bitcoin Cash wouldn\u2019t note these gains without Bitcoin\u2019s momentum either. When looking at the actual BCH chart, however, it would appear things are ripe for a correction. While few people will mind this 40% increase, it is evident such a steep uptrend in quick succession will normally not last very long. Bitcoin Cash has seen its upward and downward cycles since its inception, thus it is not unlikely another correction will occur before this week is over. Even so, now is the time to enjoy these gains and reap the profits before things potentially sour again. When looking at the bigger picture, it is evident there are a lot of interesting trends taking shape in rather quick succession. While Bitcoin Cash clearly leads the pace in this regard, other markets are crumbling under the pressure in quick succession. It will be an interesting second half of the week to determine which markets are effectively worth their salt and which will slowly disappear into obscurity. How long this uptrend will remain in place, is a different matter altogether. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/is-veriblock-to-blame-for-the-500-rise-in-bitcoin-transaction-fees/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Is VeriBlock to Blame for the 500% Rise in Bitcoin Transaction Fees?", "content": "In the cryptocurrency world, transaction fees can make or break any project. While some projects try to maintain a zero-fee transaction structure, the vast majority of them tend to charge a small amount for miners to include transactions in blocks. As such, there are some concerns over the current rise in Bitcoin transaction fees. It would appear the VeriBlock project may be [inadvertently] contributing to this rise in fees. It is never a good sign when Bitcoin becomes more expensive to move across the network. Anyone who has been involved in cryptocurrency for quite some time now will have noticed Bitcoin is often subject to transaction fee controversy. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency isn\u2019t cheap to move around the world, although it is still cheaper than most of the mainstream alternatives. Even so, it is still worth keeping an eye on these fees and how they evolve, as it is not hard to see why some users express their concerns. When looking at BTC fees chart for the past three months, a very peculiar trend has emerged. Throughout most of Q1 2019, the transaction fees have remained near the same level. While there has been a slow and steady rise on certain days, it seemed as if the situation was under control without any real problems. These costs fluctuate just like the Bitcoin price, which is only to be expected. However, in the past few weeks, the fees have seemingly spiraled out of control in rather quick succession. When looking at the big picture, the transaction fees currently on the network are a near 500% increase compared to January 1st. Although such a temporary increase in costs would be easy enough to explain, it appears this \u201cproblem\u201d has been in place for several weeks. Thankfully, it would appear the peak in fees has already passed, and things are slowly returning to normal at this time. Even so, finding an explanation for this sudden increase is a bit challenging. Several theories are floating around at this time. Some users are eager to point out the recently launched VeriBlock service may be a possible culprit. More specifically, this service writes transactions on other blockchains to a Bitcoin block, which means there is less space to include transactions in said block. It is possible this will cause a spike in fees, as the service claims over 6 million security transactions have been written to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain to date. A very spectacular amount, although it may only be part of the recent fee rise problem. Another possible explanation is how more people are moving Bitcoin across the network in general. Again, that may explain a few brief spikes, but it seems the overall trend in terms of value transferred has been the same for several weeks. This increase in costs has not prevented the most recent Bitcoin price uptrend, however, which further confirms a lot of people aren\u2019t too bothered by the cost of sending a BTC transaction at this time. For a project which aims to become the \u201cfuture of money\u201d, however, bringing the fees down would not be an unnecessary luxury. As is always the case when discussions like these take shape, there will be people who will gladly point out how \u201ccoin X\u201d is vastly superior. While that may be the case, they don\u2019t come close to Bitcoin in terms of appeal, recognition, and branding. Keeping that in mind, it remains to be seen if this temporary rise in transaction fees is something to be overly concerned about. Finding a solution to ensure incidents like this become less frequent would certainly be appreciated, but it will take a lot of time until that happens.

That in itself is a bit surprising, primarily because there was no indication anything of this kind would occur today. The Cardano price is trying to move up again, although it seems unlikely it will surpass Stellar in terms of market cap. There are many different interesting trends in the cryptocurrency world to keep an eye on. When Bitcoin moves up, alternative markets usually follow. When Bitcoin goes down, the exact same occurs but in a far more depressing manner. The current minor Bitcoin gains pay dividends for altcoins such as Cardano. This market is moving up in value, as it has successfully maintained the $0.06 level without too many problems. Over the past few hours, the Cardano price momentum has taken an interesting turn. Following a 5.6% increase in USD value and a 5% gain over Bitcoin, things are starting to look up once again. In terms of ADA/BTC, it remains to be seen how high the value can go. The current 1.546 Satoshi level seems to be solid, but a further push might be too much to ask right now. On social media, there are many people who expect big things from Cardano. Ecossexrp1, for example, prefers to buy 65,000 ADA for the same price as one Bitcoin currently, primarily because Cardano will potentially make traders a lot of money in less time. A very bullish sign, although one has to keep in mind there is a limit as to how high these altcoins can go unless Bitcoin enters the $19,000 range again. CryptoSheldon, on the other hand, looks at the ADA price chart with a different set of expectations. According to his brief TA, there is a bullish divergence forming for Cardano, which usually yields even higher values in the days to come. However, this market heavily relies on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum first and foremost, thus one shouldn\u2019t get ahead of themselves either. As has been the case for quite some time now, there is at least one triangular arbitrage opportunity for traders to explore. The one involving Cardano can yield a potential profit of up to 48%, which is rather lucrative to explore. It also involves some of the bigger exchanges, albeit not everyone is comfortable with using HitBTC, for rather obvious reasons. All of the signs seem to confirm the Cardano value may remain bullish for at least another few hours. Anything beyond that point can easily swing either way, as no one knows what will come next. Bitcoin is still on shaky legs, and another bearish wave is far from unrealistic. The best course of action is to cash out profits quickly and often before they go up in smoke again.

Others will say this uptrend was overdue and will become even more violent moving forward. As far as the Binance Con price is concerned, there is no uptrend visible as of right now. In fact, it is the only market in the top 10 to note any losses at this time. It is not uncommon for altcoins, tokens, and assets to struggle when Bitcoin remains very bullish for quite some time. Although some people still have high hopes for Binance Coin, the token simply cannot \u201chang\u201d with the top markets at this time. It is losing value across the board, as the losses continue to pile up in very quick succession. A somewhat surprising trend, although this uptrend had to end sooner or later. To be more specific, the Binance Coin price has dropped by 2.57% to $19.17. The more worrisome aspect is the 10% loss in BTC value and 11.3% loss over Ethereum. It is normal for altcoins to lose BTC value during this time, but BNB is clearly in a different league. Traders will not be happy with the way things re going, yet the current trading volume mainly represents sales rather than buys. The sentiment toward Binance Coin on social media is not looking all that great either. CryptoKop expects BNB to settle soon in BTC value, but it seems unlikely a decisive floor will be reached in the near future. This downward spiral is a sign of how BNB simply gained too much value in quick succession. A correction now and then is healthy, albeit not everyone will see it that way. Sam, on the other hand, struggles to make sense of what is happening to Binance Coin at this time. It is an unexpected trend for most holders, although everyone who knows how these markets work will acknowledge this was to be expected somewhat. As the USD-based losses continue to pile up in quick succession, it will be difficult to predict where things will head in a few hours from now. For those who look at the BBN chart, the uptrend is seemingly still in place. Given how this uptrend started in October of 2018, it seems things are not necessarily slowing down. This could be an indicator of how this current downtrend is a mere setback which will come to an end eventually. Even so, a hyperbolic chart is equally possible at this time. As is always the case in this rather unique industry, everything needs to be taken in stride and put in perspective. While Binance Coin is not performing as expected, there is no real reason to panic either. Traders who had hoped to gain more BTC in quick succession will not be too happy with the way things are going, but that is the way this industry works.

This will not be entirely surprising at this time, as Bitcoin continues to drag everything down with it in quick succession. Even the Holo price can\u2019t mount any sort of offense right now, as its value is on the verge of dropping below $0.001 once again. It is anything but surprising to learn how things are progressing across all cryptocurrency markets right now. Considering how all of these markets rely on Bitcoin first and foremost, they are destined to drop in value while the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is under a lot of pressure. For markets such as Holo, it quickly becomes evident things are not looking too great right now. Although this is to be expected, no one really knows if any bottom will be found in the coming hours. Over the past day, the Holo price has lost over 5% in USD value. Compared to Bitcoin\u2019s losses, it is evident the altcoins are bleeding value. Holo also lost 3.25% in BTC and ETH value alike, as the 30 Satoshi level has been lost once again. With the current price of $0.001099, it seems unlikely Holo will see much of an uptrend in the coming hours and days unless something changes pretty soon. For now, that seems implausible, although one never knows how this industry will look a few hours from now. One worrisome aspect for Holo is how its trading volume will not impress too many people either. As the total volume dropped to $6.13m, it seems the global interest in this market is dropping off as well. This is not in line how the overall trading volume across the industry right now, which seems to be doing quite well on its own. However, most of the money is pouring back into Bitcoin, rather than altcoins, which is only to be expected. On social media, the discussions pertaining to Holo are a bit all over the place. Steven Morris shares some interesting information explaining the difference between HOT and Holofuel, as they will be two completely separate things. It has caused a bit of confusion among HOT speculators and holders so far, but it seems things will become a lot more clear when Holofuel actually is developed and released. For now, HTO will remain the \u201cmain\u201d token, but there will be some intriguing changes on the horizon. Traders who are looking at the current HOT chart will not be too happy with the way things are going. Holo needs to find stable support first and foremost, although it remains to be seen when that level will be found exactly. A drop to 27 or even 26 Satoshi is not unlikely at this point. While the current price of 28 Satoshi has been touched upon before a few times, one has to wonder how low the price really can go this time around. Bitcoin shows no signs of improvement, which never bodes well for altcoins. All of the signs seem to indicate Holo is not in a good place, nor will it be in the near future. All eyes are on Bitcoin right now and money is being pulled out of Holo in favor of the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency. Although that is only to be expected when the bearish pressure remains in place, there may be even further pressure on the Holo market once more traders follow this lead by example. It wouldn\u2019t take much to offset some of these losses either, but traders seemingly aren\u2019t interested in exploring that option. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Contrary to most expectations, the XRP price momentum has finally flashed bullish again. Although the gains are not that big, there is an actual uptrend in XRP/BTC for a change. There has never been a boring weekend in the cryptocurrency industry so far. Albeit things did not look overly promising this morning, it seems most markets have recovered rather nicely. When even XRP manages to note green across the board, there is plenty of reason to be cautiously optimistic. How long this trend can remain in place, remains a tough question to answer. Over the past 24 hours, the XRP price has noted a 1.4% gain in both USD and BTC value. As such, one XRP is now priced at $0.312378, or 7.637 Satoshi. Most traders had given up on seeing an XRP/BTC improvement, but today hasn\u2019t disappointed so far. It is also interesting to see this asset soar past $0.31 after a turbulent week. On social media, there are plenty of discussions pertaining to XRP. One of the more odd ones is the message by Dafruid Blackaxe. While clearly a jest, using the term \u201csuicide\u201d as an ultimatum to potentially trigger market momentum is never a smart course of action. It is evident XRP sparks many different discussions, but messages like these are beyond thoughtless and crude. This user has, thankfully, deleted this message in the meantime. There is also a growing discussion regarding the \u201clegitimacy\u201d of the XRP Army on social media. Numerous people claim this is a bunch of bots, rather than real people. That is an interesting comment, especially when considering how Tron founder Justin Sun has his fair share of fake followers who are mere bots and/or duplicate accounts. Shaan Iqbal is also looking at XRP from a slightly different perspective. He expects XRP to gain utility, but it will not necessarily be the asset to replace fiat currencies by any means. Bitcoin will be a big contender. However, Ripple has never said they designed XRP to replace fiat. It is a tool to streamline and improve upon existing fiat operations. When looking at the bigger picture, it will be interesting to see where all of the markets head next. For XRP, sustaining this uptrend should not pose any real challenges, although this market tends to evolve in mysterious ways. For now, all top markets remain in the green, which is all enthusiasts can ask for. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/twitch-silently-removes-bitcoin-support-for-channel-subscriptions/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Twitch Silently Removes Bitcoin Support for Channel Subscriptions", "content": "Ensuring the mass adoption of Bitcoin and altcoins becomes a reality is an ongoing struggle. While some effort has been undertaken to make something positive happen, a lot of companies have dropped cryptocurrency support as well over the past few years. The latest company to do so is Twitch, by the look of things. Their BitPay payment option has been removed in the past few days without any prior warning. A lot of people were initially pleased to see popular streaming platform Twitch integrate cryptocurrency payments. By allowing users to send tips through Bitcoin and altcoins, an important step toward mass adoption was taken. This sentiment was later reinforced when users could actively pay for Twitch channel subscriptions in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. That functionality is made possible through BitPay, the world\u2019s leading major cryptocurrency payment processor. As is always the case when a company integrates support for Bitcoin and altcoins, there is some concern over the popularity of this option. As has been seen across other industries, once the initial hype calms down, Bitcoin and altcoins are used far less frequently. This is one of the main reasons why multiple companies removed Bitcoin payment support in recent years. It now appears Twitch has done the same, without letting their users and customers know this change was coming. When anyone tries to subscribe to a Twitch streamer, they can choose from many different payment options. The BitPay option has been removed from this list, although no one can pinpoint when this happened exactly. It seems this is not a region-based change either, as Twitch users from different continents have confirmed this payment option is no longer available. A very unfortunate turn of events, especially during these bearish times for all cryptocurrencies. One possible reason why the BitPay option was removed is due to a lack of overall interest. Although there will always be a core audience which relies on this payment method, cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t necessarily suited for subscription-based services. More specifically, Bitcoin and other currencies do not offer native \u201crecurring payment\u201d support, which is rather annoying when dealing with subscription-based services. This may be one of the reasons why the BitPay integration did not work out for Twitch in the end. As is to be expected when such a change is introduced without warning users in advance, the community feedback is not too positive by any means. A lot of Reddit users are canceling all Twitch subscriptions or are simply shutting down their own streams because of this unwelcome change. This is a rather normal reaction, although it remains to be seen if this will impact Twitch\u2019s profitability in any significant way. It seems unlikely this will make much of a difference when looking at the bigger picture. This is another sign of why cryptocurrencies are not ready for mainstream use by any means. Even though Twitch saw merit in experimenting with this new form of money, the \u201ccollaboration\u201d didn\u2019t last all that long. Although streamers can still accept Bitcoin through Coinbase \u2013 if they set up and link their personal account manually- it seems unlikely Bitcoin and altcoins will make much of an impact on Twitch in the foreseeable future. A very unfortunate development for this fledgling industry, but it was somewhat to be expected. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/top-bitcoin-casinos/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Top Bitcoin Casinos 2019 (US Friendly Crypto Gambling)", "content": "It is safe to say the cryptocurrency industry would not be where it is today without the usage of Bitcoin in online gambling. While this may seem like a niche use case, numerous Bitcoin casinos have become wildly successful over the years. There is a massive amount of Bitcoin casinos and gambling platforms available to users. Below are the top 4 Bitcoin casinos for players to choose from. Further down in the post, you will also find a list of top bitcoin dice games which you should check out if you are looking for games with the lowest house edge. Note: Online gambling may be subject to legal restrictions in some parts of the world. One of the older Bitcoin casinos available today comes in the form of mBit. The company adheres to the gambling restrictions and requirements in Curacao, which also makes it a legal entity. Their main selling points include a growing variety of games, support for live dealers, and a hefty deposit bonus. However, it is worth noting mBit only accepts Bitcoin at this time, as the company has no plans to introduce altcoin support as of right now. That situation may come to change in the future, but for now, it will be all about Bitcoin. Visit mBit Casino Another well-respected Bitcoin casino and gambling platform, Fortune Jack has built up a very solid reputation over the years. It too is regulated in Curacao, a region which seems to be rather friendly toward cryptocurrency gambling providers. With several hundred different game types to choose from, Fortune Jack caters to a very big audience. Moreover, the company supports altcoins such as Litecoin and Dogecoin, which makes it stand out from its competitors. Visit FortuneJack Casino By far considered to be the most popular Bitcoin Casino comes in the form of BitStarz. It too falls under Curacao jurisdiction, which is somewhat of a common trend among Bitcoin casinos and gambling companies. Over 1,000 different games are available for users, with more being added on a regular basis. The platform is also renowned for supporting altcoins , as well as more mainstream payment methods. This agnostic approach contributes to the company\u2019s reputation and appeal. One major selling point of BitStarz is their customer support. Rather than just relying on a contact form of web-based chat, the team also frequents social media and even Reddit. While all other companies on this list also offer good customer support, it appears BitStarz goes well beyond the norm in this regard. Visit BitStarz Casino This Bitcoin Casino has been around for a few years and has developed a reputation in the industry. The casino supports BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC and DOGE for its games. There are also various bonuses and cashback options, along with regular promos where one can receive free spins. The types of games supported by BitcoinCasino.us include High Roller, Jackpot games, Table Games, Roulette, Poker and Slot games. Visit BitcoinCasino.us If you are not familiar with Bitcoin Casinos, they are websites just like any other gambling platforms but ones that accept cryptocurrency. In fact, many Bitcoin casinos only accept cryptocurrency as payment and it\u2019s not possible to use fiat. By not dealing with fiat currencies, these platforms are able to provide faster cash outs, deposits, and make for a much more seamless experience. Furthermore, because cryptocurrency payments are irreversible, there is no need to wait for exhaustive KYC verification. Keep in mind that you might have to provide some identity verification in certain cases such as huge winnings, but 99% of the users don\u2019t face any trouble. Current regulations in the US do not explicitly state that cryptocurrency gambling is illegal. While regular online gambling is regulated and is restricted for most states, current gambling laws haven\u2019t quite caught up with cryptocurrency. There are only three states which allow for any type of gambling activity, online or offline. Those states are: Delaware, New Jersey, and Nevada. Some casinos play it safe and block any US IPs, but that doesn\u2019t mean that cryptocurrency gambling is illegal in the United States. A provably fair game is one where you can verify your bet against a third party to ensure that the casino didn\u2019t tamper with the result. All the casinos mentioned above have a section for provably fair games. If you are paranoid about a Bitcoin casino cheating you out of your winnings you may decide to play those games where the bets can be easily verified. There are three main benefits to Bitcoin Casinos: Anonymity, Provability and Speed. When it comes to using a Bitcoin Casino you usually don\u2019t have to disclose any personal information. With regular online casinos, while you may not have to do any KYC, you end up providing them with your payment details which contain all of your personally identifiable information. The second main benefit of Bitcoin casinos is the option of playing provably fair games. That\u2019s a trend that has started with crypto gambling businesses and one that ensures fairness. Last but not least, because crypto based online casinos only accept cryptocurrencies, cashouts are extremely fast and seamless. You don\u2019t have to wait days for the money to arrive at your bank account and most cash outs happen within the hour. For the casinos mentioned above, the house edge ranges between 0.5% to 2% depending on the game you play. To put this in perspective, the house edge for slot machines in Las Vegas can be as high as 10%, poker has around a 5% house edge, depending on the variation you play. The house edge for Bitcoin casinos is quite low when compared to regular casinos. This is possible with the low overhead when it comes to handling payments. If these casinos used fiat there would be all sorts of fees involved in their operation such as deposit/withdrawal fees, bank fees, etc. You have heard us talking about bitcoin casinos, think of cryptocurrency dice games as a subsection of bitcoin casinos. Dice games are usually very simple odd based games. Most of the time they are dice games where you choose a number and roll the dice, if you get a favorable result you win, otherwise you lose. Most of the time the house edge is very small for dice games and there are a variety of options when it comes to the amount of risk you would like to take. Also, some dice games have an option to perform thousands of micro bets if you would like to try out some sort of strategy. Moreover, most \u2013 if not all \u2013 cryptocurrency dice games are provably fair. Meaning you can verify the validity and fairness of any bet to ensure that the house isn\u2019t cheating you out of your winnings. If you are looking for a fun and interactive dice game, look no further! DuckDice.io is the hottest cryptocurrency dice game for 2019. With over 2 billion bets, and over 500 people online at one time this platform is proven to be a top option if you are looking to gamble a few satoshis. The interface is intuitive and you have a plethora of options when it comes to your bets. Furthermore, the house edge for the dice platform is only 1%, which is extremely conservative especially for a dice game. Visit DuckDice Another great bitcoin dice game is SafeDice. This one is just like DuckDice but the house edge is lower at 0.5%. Furthermore, just like with DuckDice you don\u2019t need to create an account to start playing. In fact, there isn\u2019t even an option to add an email if you wanted to! SafeDice is also extremely popular with over 200 million bets and over 100,000 BTC wagered, nothing compared to DuckDice but still very impressive stats. Visit SafeDice BitDice is another top cryptocurrency dice game. The main difference between BitDice and SafeDice / DuckDice is the fact that it offers other games besides dice. The other games that BitDice offers are quite unique, they are called: BitAces, Satoshi\u2019s Secret, Blast Boom Bang and Money Farm. There is also the classic Black Jack and a variation of Texas Holdem if you are looking for the classic casino games. While BitDice is not as popular as the other two dice games mentioned above, it\u2019s worth checking out if you are looking for something different. Visit BitDice Crypto-games.net is a popular online casino that focuses on fast and simple games that everybody loves. Their bitcoin dice game is extremely popular with dozens of bets per second. Every single bet is provably fair and there are options for auto betting if you are looking to perform multiple micro bets instead of one large one. The dice game for Crypto-games.net has over 2 billion bets for bitcoin alone! There have been over 3.3 billion bets overall with 149 million in the past 30 days and 2.5 million in the past 24 hours alone. There is also a public chat where you can communicate with fellow traders.", "date": "2019-03-17T19:36:39+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 17}

Some of the top markets are moving up in a decisive manner, whereas others are still on wobbly legs. The Bitcoin Cash price is surging once again, although it remains to be seen if this trend can be sustained for very long. Weekends are usually somewhat odd when it comes to cryptocurrency trading. Most people will readily agree Bitcoin Cash is a bit of an unusual market first and foremost. While the current price momentum seems to signal the coming few days will be rather interesting to keep an eye on, there is also a good chance this uptrend will come crashing down sooner or later. Since all of these top markets rely on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum first and foremost, it wouldn\u2019t take too much effort to send all markets in a downward spiral pretty quickly. Over the past few hours, the Bitcoin Cash price has risen by 10.03% in USD value and 9.52% in BTC value. Both trends look very promising, especially now that one BCH is valued at $170, or 0.042 BTC again. Combined with $509.64m in trading volume, there is a lot of positive market momentum to contend with at this time. It is also the first time in a while the BCH market cap surpasses $3bn again, which will please a lot of holders and speculators. As is always the case when it comes to alternative markets, the social media activity is interesting to keep an eye on. It would appear the \u201cofficial\u201d Bitcoin Twitter account is trying to convince the Epic Games store to accept BCH as a payment method. While they also advocate for using Bitcoin, it seems a lot of people already oppose the idea of supporting BCH. That is entirely to be expected at this time since BCH simply doesn\u2019t have a great reputation in this industry. Traders are also contemplating where things will head next for Bitcoin Cash. Crypto Future expected the ETH/BCH ratio to turn out in favor of ETH, but it clearly did not work out as planned whatsoever. Although both currencies are in no way competing with one another, their internal relation in the price department can allow traders to make some good money. It will be intriguing to see how the ETH/BCH ratio evolves in the coming weeks and months. When it comes to the current BCH chart, it is evident this latest uptrend has already seen a minor correction before resuming. TO some traders, that will be an extremely bullish sign, whereas others will expect an even steeper pushback to materialize in the very near future. Considering how the weekend is usually very odd in terms of trading behavior, there is a good chance some form of market shift will occur for BCH, either for better or worse. While all of the signs currently indicate the Bitcoin Cash value will continue to rise, there are rather steep gains in place already. A 10% push during the early hours of Saturday is not necessarily an indication as to how this market will evolve over the next 48 hours. While there may be a further push, chasing the top is not advised at this time. That goes for all other markets which note unusual gains, and not just Bitcoin Cash.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/top-5-bitcoin-casino-mistakes-you-want-to-avoid/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Top 5 Bitcoin Casino Mistakes You Want to Avoid", "content": "There is no doubt that Bitcoin casinos have always been a popular way to spend one\u2019s cryptocurrency. With how easy it is to set up an account and how quickly you can start playing it\u2019s no surprise that one of Bitcoin\u2019s main use cases is gambling. In this article we will go over the top 5 mistakes people make when it comes to choosing and using online cryptocurrency casinos. If you are looking to maximize your chances of winning, you must choose games that have the lowest house edge. Some slot games can have a house edge as high as 10%! That\u2019s simply insane. On the other hand, some games like Dice, Baccarat, Black Jack, etc. have a house edge that\u2019s only 1-2%. Keep in mind that if you are just looking to have fun then by all means choose whatever game you like, but it\u2019s important to keep the house edge in mind if you are looking to have the most chance of leaving with a profit. That\u2019s a pretty obvious mistake but one that is often overlooked. Many times, when you are on a winning streak you want to keep going and keep upping the risk. It\u2019s important to set a goal ahead of time, and if you hit that goal get out while you are still ahead. For example if you are planning to spend $100 and decide that if you double your initial investment you are going to walk away, then if you end up with $200 make sure to actually stop playing and taking your profit home. This strategy is similar to stock markets when you decide on a position where you will exit no matter what happens. Otherwise, greed takes over and is only going to hurt you in the long run. Another pretty obvious tip is to make sure you know your limits. This applies to all gambling not just bitcoin casinos. If you end up betting too much and losing it, you will be left with a sour feeling which will just ruin your day. Set a limit on what you are willing to lose that won\u2019t affect you emotionally. Gambling is somewhat similar to trading stocks / cryptocurrencies. Just like you don\u2019t want to go all in into some random altcoin, you don\u2019t want to go all in on a random slot or roulette game, you\u2019re going to have a bad time. This is one of the most common mistakes that happens with those gambling with their Bitcoins, they forget to have fun. Most people are so busy thinking of the profit they want to make that they forget to actually enjoy the moment and have fun. Most Bitcoin casinos have a chat feature which you can use to communicate with other players and just enjoy your time on the platform. Make sure you don\u2019t forget to stop for a second and have some fun!", "date": "2019-03-19T07:26:10+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 19}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/dogecoin-price-gives-up-little-ground-as-bitcoin-remains-bearish/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Dogecoin Price Gives up Little Ground as Bitcoin Remains Bearish", "content": "In theory, this would be an excellent time for altcoins to mount a very strong comeback while Bitcoin remains bearish. However, ensuring such gains materialize is often a very different matter. The Dogecoin price puts up a valiant effort in this regard, although it too notes minor losses. For now, the $0.002 level hasn\u2019t come under too much pressure as of yet. It is never a bad thing to see some of the top cryptocurrencies either maintain their value, or note the tiniest of losses when Bitcoin turns bearish again. Dogecoin often checks the right boxes in this regard, although it can also make for a boring market, according to some traders. Even today, the resilient altcoin notes small losses and successfully maintains its price above $0.002 without too many problems. Over the past 24 hours the net balance for DOGE is neither terrible nor promising. Following a 0.8% decrease in USD value and a 0.5% deficit in BTC value, the current Dogecoin price sits at $0.002045, or 51 Satoshi. Especially this latter value is of great interest to traders, as they mainly seek to increase their Bitcoin holdings. Although the Tor project confirmed they are now accepting cryptocurrency donations, Dogecoin is one notable exception on that particular list. On paper, it would make a lot more sense to accept Dogecoin over the likes of Augur, for example. It will be interesting to see if DOGE gets added tot he list at some point, but for now, that is not the case. Another interesting rather recent development is how Travala accepts Dogecoin payments. Consumers looking to book travel or accommodations through this platform can pay in DOGE, which can potentially introduce a lot more use cases moving forward. It is unclear how popular the supported currencies are on an individual basis, but having Dogecoin on the list is a big nod of approval in its own regard. One can usually leave it up to the Dogecoin community to come up with some creative ideas and connections. Kenneth Fax is an interesting example in this regard. This user feels everyone who likes National Puppy Day should also love the passion for Dogecoin. A bit of an odd correlation, although there is some argument to be made as well. While the current market momentum seemingly offers nothing to be excited about, Dogecoin remains one of the more stable markets in the top 30. When the momentum turns bearish, it doesn\u2019t budge much. The same applies to overarching bullish moment, unfortunately, but one has to take good with the bad in this industry.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitcoin-cash-price-turns-bullish-yet-bch-hate-wont-subside/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Turns Bullish yet BCH Hate Won\u2019t Subside", "content": "With most of the cryptocurrency markets still subjected to a fair bit of bearish pressure, it is rather uncommon to see one market pull ahead of the competition. For some unknown reason, the Bitcoin Cash price is still rising in spectacular fashion. It is quite interesting to see this momentum materialize, although it may be rather short-lived based on the overall market circumstances. When Bitcoin remains under a lot of pressure, it is normal for the alternative markets to suffer from similar momentum. While the exceptions will usually come in the form of smaller cap altcoins, Bitcoin Cash tries to become an exception. Ever since its value surpassed $160m, the uptrend has not been broken in a decisive manner. As such, one would expect these gains to remain in place, yet it will be interesting to see how things play out. Over the past 24 hours, the Bitcoin Cash price has noted a 6.7% gain in both USD and BTC value alike. Because of these unexpected gains, the current value has risen to $162.78, or 0.04045 Bitcoin. Both of these developments seem promising, although people looking at the bigger picture may notice the current overall circumstances might not necessarily allow this trend to stay up there for too long. As was somewhat to be expected where this market is concerned, cryptocurrency users are not favoring the altcoin in the slightest. There is a lot of hate toward BCH, as TokenPay Enthusiast illustrates. He claims BCH is a fad and could easily be ignored in favor of more established currencies such as Bitcoin or Litecoin. At the same time, this a blatant advertisement for the TokenPay service itself, which won\u2019t surprise too many people. Even though this current price momentum should warrant some excitement, Vanessa B and Fabien Braconnier are trying to make sense of it all. While there is a case to be made for this somewhat negative attitude, it is evident this market does make sense to the right people. Especially those who want to make money will not question this sudden turn of events, yet everyone else may have some second thoughts about the current state of affairs. For all of the negativity, there is at least one positive message as well. Dave McMurdo is pleased with the low fees Bitcoin Cash transactions bring to the table. While this argument could easily apply to at least a handful of other currencies in the market cap top 50, it is good to see more projects focus on reducing the fees as much as possible. No one likes to pay several dollars to move funds across a cryptocurrency network in this day and age. While the Bitcoin Cash momentum looks rather promising, it seems unlikely this uptrend will remain for long. That is not necessarily abnormal in this industry, as everything stands and ends with Bitcoin. Even BCH will see an uphill battle if Bitcoin decides to remain bearish for an extended period of time. Remaining above $160 will always be the main objective for BCH at this time, whereas every other value change else is trivial. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bitlicense-like-bitcoin-regulation-is-coming-to-five-additional-us-states/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "BitLicense-like Bitcoin Regulation is Coming to Five Additional US States", "content": "In the cryptocurrency world, there is always a lot of dismay when governments or policymakers try to introduce some form of regulation. In the United States, the introduction of BitLicense has been discussed heavily in recent years. It now seems very similar guidelines might be making their way to as many as five additional states in the near future. Although it has gone relatively quiet on the BitLicense front recently, that may not be the case for much longer, by the look of things. More specifically, it seems officials from various US states, together with the ULC, are preparing to introduce cryptocurrency guidelines across multiple US states. These guidelines will be in line with BitLicense, one of the most controversial forms of regulation in recent years. To put everything into perspective, the BitLicense is considered to be stifling growth for cryptocurrency as an industry. It is also one of the main reasons New York-based residents can only access a handful of crypto exchanges and other services these days. The main question is whether or not more companies will halt their services in New York or the other regions which will introduce very similar guidelines later this year. As is always the case when these types of discussion occur, it is important to be aware of all the facts. First of all, this proposal to introduce new guidelines was opened to public comment in the affected US states. For some unknown reason, no one seemed to oppose this concept in the state of Nevada, which either indicates no one knew it was happening, or no one bothered to oppose it. If it is the latter, there is no right for anyone in that state to complain if these new rules are effectively enforced in the near future. Among the affected states are Nevada, California, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Hawaii. The choice for introducing these new guidelines is pretty interesting, particularly because California is considered to be a major state in terms of crypto usage. However, the use of Bitcoin and altcoins has been allowed without any rules or guidelines for some time, thus it was only a matter of time until that situation came to change. It remains a bit unclear what the future will hold for cryptocurrency in these five states. While the introduction of BitLicense-like guidelines could potentially force numerous companies to no longer serve clients in those regions, it remains to be seen if it will ever come to that. After all, the introduction of guidelines is still better than officially banning Bitcoin and altcoins in any of these regions. When looking at the bigger picture, it seems this development will benefit Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the long run. That will only happen if the rules are introduced in a proper manner, albeit it is too early to draw any real conclusions in that regard. The cryptocurrency community can still make their voice be heard in this regard, although it remains to be seen if that would influence this set of rules in any significant way.", "date": "2019-03-16T13:24:07+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 16}

Today, it seems as if Bitcoin Cash is effectively noting the strongest gains in the top 10, which comes as a big surprise to a lot of people. With this 17% increase in value, the Bitcoin Cash price has surpassed $150 and $155 in rather quick succession. Sustaining this violent growth will pose its own set of challenges. While it is good to see so many markets in the green on a Saturday morning, one has to wonder if this is just a temporary turn of events. If the previous weekends have taught the community anything, it is to never look a gift horse in the mouth and cash out profits before it is too late. So far, it seems they are not following the second part of that advice just yet, at least where Bitcoin Cash is concerned. That particular altcoin is shooting up like a rocket right now, primarily because of its high trading volume. Over the past 24 hours, the Bitcoin Cash has undergone some major changes. More specifically, there is a 17.2% gain in USD value and a 13.65% increase in BCH/BTC. Because of these gains, one BCH is now valued at $156.77, or 0.03878 Bitcoin. A very promising trend, all things considered, although it is in line with what one would expect to see given the overall circumstances. Maintaining any growth in crypto land has been very difficult, if not nigh impossible, for most projects. The opinions regarding Bitcoin Cash have always been a bit over the place. This sudden rise in value is not changing that situation whatsoever, as it seems to only strengthen people\u2019s beliefs. XRP Hodler is convinced BCH is the only real Bitcoin, as BTC itself is nothing like what Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned. This train of thought has been around for a while now, yet it seems BCH is still incapable of even rivaling Bitcoin at this time. Nababati, on the other hand, would prefer to see this mixture of Bitcoin forks come to an end once and for all. Both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV could be deleted from the ecosystem, according to this user, so all the money can pour back into the real Bitcoin. It seems unlikely that will happen anytime soon, though, as all of these ecosystems have their own following and supporters right now. For those who take a closer look at the BCH price chart, it quickly becomes evident this uptrend will not necessarily be sustainable for very long. More specifically, this sudden and sharp increase in value seemingly lacks support to prevent a collapse. That in itself could turn out to be quite catastrophic for Bitcoin Cash in the coming hours, although it is too early to draw any real conclusions as of right now. All of the signs seem to indicate today can be a very positive day for all cryptocurrency markets. Although there is some bearish pressure across the hourly charts for most of the top currencies right now, it seems no major changes should be expected in the hours to come. It is still rather early in the day to make any accurate predictions, yet it would appear most of the gains could remain in place for a while. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

In a surprising turn of events, the Bitcoin Gold price is surging as of right now. No one knows why that is the case or how long the run will last this time around. It is evident a looming bearish trend is forming across the Bitcoin price chart as of right now. This momentum is not what traders want to see, although it\u2019s not entirely surprising either. A day of solid gains usually results in a pullback prior to moving up again. Pressure on the Bitcoin price usually bodes well for some altcoins, even though most are already dipping in the red as of right now. One of the altcoins noting solid momentum during this in-between time is Bitcoin Gold. Since no one seems to actively discuss BTG these days, it is all the more surprising to see the Bitcoin Gold price move up by nearly 20% across the board. With a current value of $12.70, one BTG is priced a fair bit higher than some people think it should. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, however, Bitcoin Gold is not subjected to a massive increase in trading volume. Instead, the $10.5m in volume is pretty standard for this Bitcoin clone. It may not necessarily be sufficient to keep the uptrend alive for very long. At the same time, it doesn\u2019t seem as if too many people are intent on selling BTG right now, as holders have been waiting for profits for quite some time now. No actual development has occurred recently to warrant a BTG price increase. As such, this has all of the markings of a potential pump-and-dump cycle, although it is still too early to draw any real conclusions. Since most of the trading volume seems to come from Coinbit \u2013 which has its volume excluded \u2013 and P2PB2B, it seems unlikely this price change is a genuine one. For those traders willing to take a small gamble, there are some arbitrage opportunities involving Bitcoin Gold as of right now. The price spread between Koineks and some other exchanges is relatively big, which allows for a profit of up to 4.7% per trade. It is still a bit of a risky move, as the Bitcoin Gold value will undoubtedly fluctuate significantly for some time to come. When the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency loses value for no apparent reason, some alternative markets will go through a pump cycle for no apparent reason. That is simply how this industry works in this day and age. While this will be a promising trend for long-term BTG speculators, it is unlikely these gains will remain in place for long. Once traders begin taking profits, the uptrend will be halted rather abruptly. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Answering that first part of the question will be done throughout the weekend, as the value is swiftly approaching this barrier. However, if the previous months are any indication, the uptrend may not remain in place very long. It has been coming for some time now, but it seems Bitcoin might effectively surpass the $4,000 level once again. Assuming that effectively happens \u2013 which is not a guarantee by any means \u2013 the other markets will undoubtedly follow suit in pretty quick succession. For the time being, the momentum seems somewhat promising for the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency, but nothing is ever set in stone. Over the past 24 hours, the net balance for Bitcoin looks pretty interesting. With a 1.1% gain in quick succession, one BTC is now valued at $3.963. It would not take too much effort to bridge the gap to $4,000 at this rate, although gains have been somewhat difficult to come by for Bitcoin as of late. Hanging on to the current gain will pose its own set of challenges as well. What is rather interesting to take note of is how Bitcoin\u2019s trading volume sits comfortably at over $9bn. While this has been the case for several weeks, it seems this support is finally paying off for traders and speculators. A small nudge toward $10bn will undoubtedly get some people excited although that is much easier said than done. CoinBene is the largest \u201ccounted\u201d exchange for BTC trading volume right now, which is rather surprising. On social media, the opinions regarding Bitcoin\u2019s future price momentum are all over the place. HoDLer, for example, seems to expect a further push upward, at least where BTC/EUR is concerned. By default, this should mean BTC/USD keeps moving up alongside it, although both markets tend to do their own thing every now and then. Ultimately, this run will collapse again, according to this trader, which won\u2019t surprise too many people. Secondly, it seems a new Coinbase email is making the rounds which has some people hyped up. New fees would be introduced and market stops will be removed from Coinbase Pro. How that affects all of the supported currencies on this platform, is a different matter altogether. Assuming this information is legitimate, it can spell interesting times for Bitcoin, among other projects. All things considered, this weekend may prove to be very interesting for all cryptocurrencies. With Bitcoin leading the charge in terms of seemingly bullish momentum, anything can happen over the next few days. There is no guarantee these gains will still be in place in several hours from now, but one can only hope this is the beginning of something promising.

For the time being, all of the top markets are in the dirt, with losses piling up very quickly for some. One of the biggest \u201closers\u2019 to date is Bitcoin Cash, as its value is retracing rather sharply. This is primarily because of Bitcoin\u2019s downtrend, although BCH itself has no reason to gain value either. It is evident every currency derives value from Bitcoin these days. Even the markets which have tried to build a better Bitcoin are not seeing much success when the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is struggling significantly. For Bitcoin Cash, the momentum is not looking all that promising either. In fact, there is a genuine chance things will continue to go downhill from here, which is rather worrisome. Over the past few hours, the Bitcoin Cash price has lost nearly 6% in USD value and 3.5% compared to Bitcoin. As such, both of these trends seem to confirm BCH is not generating much interest among traders and speculators. This is despite having $298m in trading volume. For now, this negative trend will probably continue for a while, at least until Bitcoin picks up the pace. On social media, there are some interesting tidbits of information pertaining to BCH. More specifically, CryptoSign highlights some compelling features which make Bitcoin Cash worth looking into, It is certainly true all of these aspects make for a very appealing cryptocurrency project, albeit it seems investors don\u2019t necessarily agree. What is rather interesting to take note of is how Bitcoin Cash is one of just five different currencies supported on the Travala platform. As this platform continues to see more interest from consumers, it is safe to assume the use of BCH is also increasing on this platform. No real specifics are provided in this regard, although it seems things are progressing nicely. Last but not least, it would appear the X4CHANGE platform has begun its rapid and rather aggressive expansion around the world. By going live in Peru, more people can now trade BCH against other cryptocurrencies and over 20 different payment methods in total. Another notch in the belt for all supported currencies, for rather obvious reasons. All things considered, everything behind the scenes is working just fine for Bitcoin Cash. On the price front, however, there is nothing to be overly excited about at this time. While there is always a chance things will improve in the near future, the current momentum is simply not too appealing. Until that situation changes, all markets will suffer from extensive bearish pressure, which may remain in place for quite some time to come. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/what-is-a-bitcoin-maximalist/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "What is a Bitcoin Maximalist?", "content": "People who are invested in cryptocurrencies will usually try to see the bigger picture. This industry is about more than just the top 15 markets ranked by market cap. Even so, there are people out there known as \u201cBitcoin Maximalists\u201d. Since this term causes a fair bit of confusion, now is a good time to address what makes one a Bitcoin Maximalist. As the name somewhat suggests, a Bitcoin Maximalists is an individual who values Bitcoin above all else. Although that idea might apply to most cryptocurrency users and investors, there is a bit more to this \u201cideology\u201d. Rather than appreciating innovation brought to the table by alternative projects, a Bitcoin Maximalist couldn\u2019t care less about those coins. Instead, such a person sees everything that is not Bitcoin as useless clutter. While this is a point of view which is understandable up to a certain degree, it has become a lot more complicated to maintain this train of thought. Bitcoin will \u2013 probably \u2013 remain the top cryptocurrency for a very long time to come, regardless of how one wants to look at it. However, that doesn\u2019t mean the other coins, tokens, and assets are \u201cshit\u201d compared to Bitcoin. Most of these projects do not even target the same audience, which is part of what makes this industry is so exciting. It is also worth noting Bitcoin Maximalists seemingly adhere to Metcalfe\u2019s Law. For those unaware, this concept pertains to how effective any network can be. This doesn\u2019t just pertain to cryptocurrencies, but also to telecommunication, social networking, et cetera. Bitcoin Maximalists often state how all alternative markets take away much-needed resources from Bitcoin in terms of nodes, service providers, innovation, and so forth. It is not an argument that goes over well with crypto-agnostic enthusiasts, though. At the same time, the statistics contradict this train of thought a bit. Bitcoin\u2019s network continues to grow without any problems. Thousands of nodes exist, and the Lightning Network is gaining more support every month. Additionally, none of the service providers is \u201cwasting resources\u201d by supporting currencies that are not Bitcoin. Even so, for Bitcoin Maximalists, it is all fuel for the fire in which all alternative markets should burn. Although it seems being a Bitcoin Maximalist is a bad thing, that is not necessarily the case. It is a very different vie won the cryptocurrency industry as a whole, but one that can be understood somewhat. Most of the alternative cryptocurrency projects bring some form of innovation to the table, although the big breakthroughs will usually end up as a part of Bitcoin in the future. This only strengthens the idea of why Bitcoin will rule the industry for quite some time to come. Rest assured there will be no shortage of new \u201cBitcoin competitors\u201d in the years to come. Thousands of projects have come and gone, but that doesn\u2019t mean developers will give up on their ideas anytime soon. It is a good thing for Bitcoin to have some competition, even if none of those projects has a chance of overtaking Bitcoin. Being a Bitcoin Maximalist is fine and dandy, but it may not necessarily be the best method to approach this industry. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

But many are still skeptical about whether it is all a hype or a real opportunity to invest. The other half are not even sure how the blockchain and crypto actually work. Whichever category you belong to, it is a fact that both blockchain and cryptocurrencies are capable of changing the world in several ways. To understand how that would and could happen, first you have to know what these are. In simple terms, blockchain is a system that stores all the information of transactions made using any cryptocurrency. They are stored in the form of blocks that are linked to one another. Each block, in turn, has the information from the previous making it impossible to modify the data. Bitcoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market now. It is decentralized, but since each transaction is verified with blockchain, it is far from being unaccountable. It won\u2019t be long before blockchain becomes hugely established and takes over many aspects of our daily lives. As students, it is imperative to be updated about the current technologies as they play a massive role in today\u2019s academics. Nowadays, it is possible to do an entire course online and get all the assistance, including materials needed, for that online. Students can also use online services to receive assistance with college and other academically related works. A great academic help service recommended by essay writing service reviews is EssayPro. For over a decade, this successful online platform has been providing top quality essays, research papers, dissertations, etc. Their experienced and highly talented writers ensure that the work is delivered on time and meets all the specified requirements. Similar to how technology revolutionized education, cryptocurrency is going to impact our financial system. Operating with cryptocurrency will require a certain skillset, which is going be in highly sought after in the future. Having foreseen this, many universities are offering business classes and other courses on cryptocurrencies. Stanford Graduate School of Business, Wharton Business School and Georgetown have all acknowledged the importance of offering courses about cryptocurrency. Today, there is an increase in companies looking to recruit employees who have an understanding of the workings of blockchain technology. With the 2017 surge in Bitcoin prices, there is no better time to learn and prepare yourself for a world highly equipped with this technology. To learn which study areas would be affected by blockchain, it is essential to know which fields would be the most affected. All data would be verified and encrypted with cryptography, creating waves of changes in how we store data and process it. It would almost make the system immune to hackings. Payments and transactions would be faster than ever, more efficient and secure. Many banks are already on their way to switching over to blockchain technology. Faster, safer and reliable modes of communication that are automated and digitalized. The field will see many innovations to adapt to technological advancement. Blockchain will put an end to corruption as every penny would be accounted for. It will promote transparency in bureaucracy, security and all government benefits would be verified. Most importantly, anything that is embedded with software, today that includes almost about anything will be much safer. Blockchain will address many critical security concerns and will increase the capabilities to a new level. These are only a few of the major areas that would be influenced. In short, whichever field you choose to work, blockchain and bitcoin would become as important as computers are today. Students should make use of the time and opportunity to train themselves in the field. All the impacts aside, most of the news about bitcoin is about its investments. In the US, 18% of students own cryptocurrencies. More are willing to invest in it and take up courses to educate themselves. Like any other investment, there are risk factors involved in this too. The regulatory and legal issues alone could change things in the future. Since there is no regulation from the authorities, there is also less consumer protection here. As students, if you are considering investing financially in cryptocurrency, you should be cautious. On the other hand, it would be wise to invest in your future and sign up for blockchain courses and become an expert yourself.", "date": "2019-03-01T04:33:19+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 1}

Younger generations seem to struggle less with this new concept of money. Although Bitcoin is far from granny-proof at this stage, a recent Lightning Network trial confirmed things are heading in the right direction. From the perspective of using Bitcoin as money, it quickly becomes apparent there is a lot of work left to be done these days. Not only is Bitcoin relatively difficult to obtain for the average person on the street, effectively \u201cowning\u201d BTC involves a fair bit of work as well. It is not a compelling alternative for most people, and changing that narrative will not be easy whatsoever. Even though Bitcoin wallets have become more user-friendly, they are still subjected to a steep learning curve. Sending payments to other people is still complex, as it usually requires scanning QR codes or entering details manually. Neither of those options is appealing to consumers, regardless of their age. Especially for elderly people, dealing with this fancy yet cumbersome technology is not something they have been looking forward to. One possible solution comes in the form of the Lightning Network. This new scaling layer streamlines Bitcoin payments. Users can open and sue payment channels for proper peer-to-peer payments. Moreover, these transactions are both cheaper and faster compared to how the Bitcoin network operates normally. It is widely considered to be a vast improvement, even though it can always be improved upon. Big was people\u2019s surprise when it turned out even the elderly have \u2013 seemingly \u2013 no problems using the Lightning Network. More specifically, a Bitcoin user\u2019s grandmother \u2013 who is 88 years old \u2013 has successfully conducted a Lightning transaction without any real problems. While this may be a very unique exception, it does show there is more to this technology than initially meets the eye. While most of the details regarding this procedure remain unclear, it has been confirmed by several people the experiment was successful. This is also the first time one can truly call Bitcoin to be financially inclusive, rather than financially \u201cawkward\u201d. Stories like these highlight the potential of what Bitcoin can become in years from today. It is also a good example of why people need to learn to look beyond the price per BTC. It is evident Bitcoin still has a very long way to go. It may not become a mainstream form of payment for the foreseeable future. However, the Lightning Network shows interesting things can happen if people are willing to make it work. It is now up to this elderly person to keep the momentum going and broadcast an LN transaction of her own in the near future.

While it remains to be seen if and when all of these losses can be recuperate din quick succession, some altcoins are already in the green again. The Bitcoin SV price, for example, is firing on all cylinders, even though it faced plenty of bearish pressure of its own. It is always interesting to see how different altcoins perform when they are put under a lot of bearish pressure. Whereas most markets tend to crumble first and foremost, others are trying to buck the overall trend. Bitcoin SV is one of the first currencies in the top 15 to effectively turn bullish, which may be a promising sign for all of the other markets. It is still too early to say for sure what will come next, though. Over the past hour or two, the Bitcoin SV price noted a strong 5.7% gain in USD value to hit $69.86 again. There is also a 10.9% gain over Bitcoin itself, which comes as a much bigger surprise. After all, now is a good time for altcoins to gains on Bitcoin, yet Bitcoin SV is usually not on the short list to effectively do so. Today proves to be an interesting exception in that regard. While other altcoins are pumping for no apparent reason, things are a bit different where BSV is concerned. CoinGate confirms they are introducing BSV merchant support. Although it is still up to individual companies and service providers to introduce Bitcoin SV payments, one has to acknowledge the initial support can be quite promising in its own right. For now, the news seems to get a lot of people excited. There are still a lot of people who consider Bitcoin SV to be the only real Bitcoin on the market today. While that is certainly a point which can be agreed upon by BSV members, the rest of the crypto community is not necessarily in the same boat. Mr. Scatman is clearly a fan of BSV, although it remains unlikely this offspring will ever overtake Bitcoin in terms of market cap, traction, or appeal. When looking at the actual price chart, it is evident the gain is quite spectacular. Such a bullish candle on the chart sends a clear message to the rest of the crypto industry. The main question is whether or not other markets will be able to follow suit, as Bitcoin SV doesn\u2019t necessarily note the big trading volume nor interest compared to some other projects. All things considered, this market reversal comes at the most opportune time. Not just for Bitcoin SV, but also for all other cryptocurrencies on the market. yesterday\u2019s dip took many people by surprise, yet it seems some of those losses can be negated today. Nothing is officially set in stone until Bitcoin itself begins moving up in a decisive manner again. For now, that hasn\u2019t happened as of yet.

February 20th, 2019, Willemstad, Curacao \u2013 At the end of 2018, EOSBet received an official online gambling license and certified itself as one of the top-rated EOS dapps. EOSBet has stormed into 2019 releasing a decentralised account system along with native Bitcoin deposits and betting. EOSBet Account System Features Typically, interacting and engaging with blockchain technology has numerous entry barriers, such as setting up cryptocurrency wallets after going through the lengthy process of obtaining cryptocurrency in the first place. However, the EOSBet team worked to develop a system which enables users to deposit funds from any source and easily bet without the use of a wallet or 3rd party software. This system also covers all blockchain costs for players, allowing them to play just as easily on a decentralised casino as a traditional centralised one. Like all other aspects of the platform, EOSBet\u2019s account system is decentralised and completely on-chain. All actions are fully viewable on any block explorer and become permanently part of the EOS blockchain. The system is also non-custodial, meaning players always maintain complete and sole control of their funds. EOSBet has stated that they built this system with the average non-technical gambler in mind. The two-click sign up process is simple, intuitive, and easier than creating an account on many centralised sites. This advancement allows non-EOS account holders to bet securely and participate in EOSBet\u2019s exceptionally generous player rewards program, opening the door to new markets. One month after launch, the account system has over 280 users who have collectively bet over $1.3M USD. Introducing Bitcoin Betting EOSBet has become the first on-chain casino to natively accept Bitcoin, with many more currency implementations on the way. Players simply deposit BTC to their accounts, play instantly, and withdraw when they please. This development is a significant step forward in the company\u2019s stated goal of bringing thousands of new users to the platform. Bitcoin gambling is a multi-billion dollar market, with hundreds of BTC bets placed each second on various centralised sites. EOSBet\u2019s provable fairness, full decentralisation, and attractive player rewards program offer an enticing reason for players to move to the platform. Additionally, the team plans to accept BCH, BSV, LTC, DASH, DOGE, ETH, TRON, and XRP. The high-speed gameplay users have come to expect from EOSBet will not change regardless of the currency used. BET token holders will receive dividends for life in all currencies offered. To date, the platform has distributed over $2M USD as part of its Player Rewards Program. The platform is also expected to launch two new games, a stimulating leaderboard, and a token distribution program in Q1 2019. Off to a hot start this year, the top-ranked blockchain casino is looking to take the online gambling world by storm and bring a compelling blockchain use case to the mainstream.

All markets are going in the deep red very quickly right now. The XRP price is no exception, as it remains under heavy bearish pressure in both USD and BTC markets. The Coinbase Pro listing isn\u2019t doing much to change that fact at this time. Despite some very promising signs throughout February of 2019, it seems unlikely the month will end on a high note. That is rather unfortunate, although it is not entirely unexpected as well. A lot of money was poured into all cryptos, tokens, and digital assets. It is only normal some of that money is pulled out again once traders pocket decent profits. As far as the XRP price is concerned, there is a 3.3% decline on the chart right now. With its current USD value near the $0.3088 level, a drop below $0.3 is not as unlikely as some people want to think. There is also a 1.22% decline in RP/BTC, which can push that ratio to 8,100 Satoshi or potentially lower as well. Not the tends traders are looking for by any means. Despite the negative price pressure, the Ripple team is still forging ahead. In its latest Insights post, the company touches upon streamlining remittance from Brazil. This can be a crucial market for Ripple in the future, although it remains to be seen how this \u201cpush\u201d will impact XRP in the long run. Ripple and XRP are two very different entities, although they are also entwined in many ways. The big news this week so far is how XRP has finally made its way to Coinbase Pro. While it will not land on \u201cregular\u201d Coinbase at this time, many people expected this news to trigger some upward price momentum. Unfortunately, that has not happened in the slightest. KenCarv is seemingly not too amused by the current market trend, but there is nothing to be done about it. Despite the current bearish pressure, some traders are still optimistic regarding the future. Jgolberino, for example, expects XRP to hit an all-time high this month. It is safe to assume he means the month of March, as February is almost over. Even so, there is nothing that warrants an XRP ATH at this time, as that would require a near 1,200% increase in value. When Bitcoin capitulates, it is only normal the rest of the markets follow in quick succession. XRP Is no longer an exception to this unwritten rule which will undoubtedly frustrate a lot of people.

Contrary to that belief, XRP is not noting any gains right now. Instead, the Ethereum price is getting all the love, as this value is seemingly underway to hit $130 in fairly quick succession. Bitcoin usually dictates the pace for all other top cryptocurrencies. This is not entirely abnormal, as the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is often the gateway to getting involved in altcoins, tokens, and digital assets. Over the past few days, the Bitcoin momentum has seemingly had less of an influence on the Ethereum value. That seems to be a positive development. To put this in perspective, the Ethereum price has gained another 3.6% in USD and BTC value over the past few hours. This rise in BTC is needed to offset Bitcoin\u2019s slightly bearish market momentum. Because of these recent gains, one Ether is now valued at nearly $128. A push to $130 seems plausible although it might not necessarily occur today. It would appear the recent Bitcoin \u201crejection\u201d usually does not bode well for Litecoin and Ethereum. However, Ethereum is, according to Gold & Crypto, a wild card because of its upcoming Constantinople hard fork. Even so, the resiliency of this market will be thoroughly tested over the coming weeks, regardless of what happens to Bitcoin in the process. Ethereum West is one of those Twitter accounts which has seemingly been waiting patiently for a small uptrend. Claiming how this is a \u201cmoon flag\u2019 is very premature even under the best of circumstances, although one can always hope this is the beginning of a bigger uptrend. That will primarily depend on market markers and speculators, though. When looking at the actual Ethereum chart, it seems the coming hours may prove to be crucial. The ETH/BTC chart is heading toward an RSI bearish Divergence, according to the 100eyes Crypto Scanner. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean any major changes should be expected overnight, When looking at the big picture, it seems as if Ethereum actively tries to decouple itself from Bitcoin. Although this has been attempted in the past without much success, it appears this attempt has a bit more \u201cjuice\u201d to it. In the end, Bitcoin will boost or drag down all markets eventually. A clean break between BTC and ETH would be interesting, but it has not occurred as of yet. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Rakuten, one of the famous Asian technology giants, acknowledges this demand. The company is expanding the functionality of its payments app and will also integrate cryptocurrency support. An unexpected positive turn of events. Japan has proven to be a breeding ground for innovative payment solutions. Especially in the mobile department, the competition is heating up every single week. Rakuten, while perhaps best known for its online store, is also a traditional finance company/ Their focus on the Japanese market has been well-documented over recent years. In its latest earnings report, a surprising announcement was made. To put this in perspective, the Rakuten Pay app will receive a big overhaul. Once the new version goes live in March 2019, users will be able to benefit from significant changes. Native support such as Rakuten Card and payment cards, barcodes, and QR code payments will take center stage. All of these features will be very useful within Japan, as consumers are spending more and more money through mobile applications these days. While all of these developments are impressive, a lot of people were surprised to hear the company point at cryptocurrency support. It is a bit unclear what type of functionality will be included exactly. Rakuten acquired a domestic Bitcoin exchange in Q3 2018. Known as Minna no Bitcoin, the platform provides convenient access to buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin in Japan. It would appear the exchange\u2019s core functionality will be integrated into Rakuten Pay moving forward. Combined with the support for linked credit cards and QR code payments, some interesting use cases may be unlocked in the future. Whether or not specific limits will be put in place or additional KYC verification may be required, remains to be determined. It is also worth noting the Minna no Bitcoin platform has not seen much activity since it was acquired by Rakuten. In fact, it appears this platform will also go through a facelift of sorts and services will be resumed in April of 2019. That means the Rakuten Pay app will be released with cryptocurrency functionality before the associated platform itself resumes its normal operations. How this will affect the cryptocurrency industry as a whole, remains unclear. It seems Rakuten is keen on bringing Bitcoin to more consumers in Japan. Moreover, their plan to provide convenient access to all kinds of payment methods through one application is a very significant development. Cryptocurrencies are like any other form of money or value, viable as a payment method. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Its value has not risen all that much either, especially after peaking at $80. Even so, the past few hours resulted in a major Bitcoin Private price spike, primarily because of the upcoming coin burn stage. In the cryptocurrency world, numerous projects try to mimic Bitcoin or improve it in some way. Most of these efforts have been in vain, primarily because it is a lot more difficult to build up a cryptocurrency rather than just copy existing code. In the case of Bitcoin Private, things have not gone according to plan. In fact, it would appear this project is all but irrelevant to most crypto users these days. That in itself is not completely surprising either. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a surprising turn of events where the Bitcoin Private price is concerned. Following a strong 30% gain in both USD and BTC value, it would appear as if things are heading in the right direction once again. One has to keep in mind this is all happening without any significant trading volume, although that in itself has never been a hindrance for this altcoin. There is seemingly a good reason as to why Bitcoin Private is of bigger interest as of right now. More specifically, the team has confirmed a coin burn phase will occur in less than a week from now. Any coins issued to original BTC holders which have not moved ever since will simply be taken out of circulation. A bit of a controversial decision, for obvious reasons. John Warmerdam is convinced there will be a positive effect on the price because of this coin burn. While it is logical to assume the available supply for BTCP will decrease significantly, there is a good chance this will not matter much where the price is concerned. After all, these coins were never moved to exchanges in the first place, thus they have not played a role in the grand scheme of things either. As is to be expected, a lot of people are not too happy about this decision either. Kay Vossenaar dislikes the entire concept, primarily because people are \u201cfed up\u201d with shenanigans like these. While it is a bit unclear what he means exactly, it is possible this user hasn\u2019t managed to access his BTCP ever since they were issued. With those coins now being destroyed in a few days from today, recovering them will become virtually impossible. Considering how valuable a coin burn really is, it may have an interesting impact on BTCP after all. It should not affect the value too much, as the number of use cases for Bitcoin Private remains limited first and foremost. As such, it would appear the fallout of this new phase will be pretty minimal as well. Even so, there will be some market movements, although there simply isn\u2019t enough trading volume to make anything happen right away. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/go-long-or-short-bitcoin-using-usdc-on-delta-exchange/", "author": "Guest", "title": "Go Long or Short Bitcoin Using USDC On Delta Exchange", "content": "Cryptocurrency derivatives marketplace, Delta Exchange has launched the World\u2019s first stablecoin-settled futures on bitcoin and leading altcoins. With the days of one way up moves in cryptocurrency prices behind us, the global crypto trading action is moving to futures exchanges. Trading crypto futures has several advantages: (1) a trader can go both long or short, (2) can use leverage to amplify trading gains and (3) enjoy lower trading fees. However, most crypto futures exchanges accept margin only in bitcoin. This means regardless of what crypto a trader is betting on, she is long bitcoin. Delta Exchange is removing this limitation by pioneering crypto futures that are margined and settled in USDC. USDC is a stablecoin that is pegged to the US Dollar. Consequently, USDC settled futures are quite similar to US Dollar settled futures. How are stablecoin-settled crypto futures Gamechangers In a futures trade, margin serves as collateral. The profit/ loss from a trade will either add to or subtract from the margin. When margin is in bitcoin, then the dollar value of the margin changes due to both trade profit/ loss as well as bitcoin price. Since most traders think of their net worth in dollar-terms, the impact of bitcoin volatility on margin value is usually unwanted. Keeping margin in USDC solves this problem elegantly as only the trade profit/ loss impacts the trader\u2019s net worth. Stablecoins have already revolutionized spot cryptocurrency trading. The market share of crypto to crypto trading was miniscule before the introduction of USDT. The exponential increase in USDT market cap and USDT pairs trading is a testament to the intrinsic demand for stablecoins in crypto trading. Delta Exchange believes that introduction of USDC-settled futures will address this need in crypto futures trading and will provide a major fillip to cryptocurrency derivatives trading. Delta Exchange offers USDC settled futures for bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and ripple (XRP). The prices of these futures contracts are in US dollars, but the margining and settlement currency is USDC. Delta Exchange allows only bitcoin deposit and withdrawals. However, traders can change BTC to USDC in a couple of clicks using the \u2018Currency Converter\u2019. Even those users that are trading BTC-settled futures contracts can avoid bitcoin price volatility by converting their non-trading BTC balance to USDC. Delta Exchange is a marketplace for trading of cryptocurrency derivatives. The exchange currently lists futures on bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), ripple (XRP) and stellar lumens (XLM), that allow up to 100x leverage and are settled in USDC or BTC. The founding team of Delta Exchange has worked with Wall Street firms like Citigroup and UBS and has raised money from the likes of Softbank and Sequoia for their prior ventures. It will be interesting how the market reacts to stablecoin futures and if Delta Exchange has cracked the secret to challenge the big fish in the crypto derivatives space.

One notable exception comes in the form of the NEM price, which seemingly rises without too many problems. Although its current gains are not that spectacular, it is good to see some positive momentum materialize today. In the world of cryptocurrency, there will always be a handful of markets which can do their own thing regardless of the overall market trend. NEM Appears to be one of those projects which currently bucks the overall bearish trend, although one has to wonder how long it will remain in place. Under normal circumstances, no coin can escape Bitcoin\u2019s grasp for very long when things head south. Over the past few hours, there has been a notable change where the NEM price is concerned. Although the 3.5% gain in both USD and BTC value is very impressive at this time, it doesn\u2019t help either value move up that much. One XEM is valued at $0.0423, or 1,170 Satoshi. This small rise may be sufficient in terms of building support at higher levels. One thing holding back the NEM run is the lack of overall trading volume. Although $17m in volume is still better than most altcoins on the market today, it is evident that might not be sufficient to sustain any form of uptrend. Nearly all of the volume comes from XEM/BTC pairs, which means Bitcoin holders are chasing some quick profits during this downtime. It would also appear some XEM traders are not too confident this uptrend will remain in place for long. AssertionError claims this trend has occurred multiple times over and always ended with a push downward. It is possible history will continue to repeat itself in this regard, albeit one never knows what the future will hold for alternative cryptocurrencies. In more positive news, it would appear some changes will be coming to the underpinning technology of NEM. A vote will be organized fairly soon. To streamline the process for all community members, some minor changes have been introduced. It is a positive sign in terms of building a future for this somewhat troubled project. All things considered, it remains to be determined what the future will hold in terms of NEM\u2019s value. Considering how the overall market momentum is rather bearish, it is safe to assume NEM will follow a similar path overnight. However, if Bitcoin were to resume its slow and steady bull trend again, this may only be the first step toward a bigger price increase for NEM. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Especially if the company in question deals with altcoin payments. The bearish market of 2018 and early 2019 creates a lot of dismay. However, there is also the recent Bitcoin Cash \u201cfork\u201d which forced EasyDNS to drop BCH as a payment method altogether. Although it is always good to see companies and service providers embrace cryptocurrency payments, they usually don\u2019t stick with their decision for long. Numerous companies have dropped Bitcoin support in recent years. Others have tried to experiment with altcoins, albeit with very little success in most cases. In the case of EasyDNS, some of their previous decisions have not panned out as well as originally assumed More specifically, the company was one of the first to officially accept Bitcoin Cash. Albeit it is still a forked version of Bitcoin, the team felt accepting it was the right thing to do. After all, Bitcoin Cash was a consensus-based fork, which makes some sense to a certain degree. As such, dealing with both payment options seemed like a smart idea. Payment processors such as BitPay also maintain this dual-coin approach, for the time being. However, it appears as if EasyDNS is no longer accepting Bitcoin Cash. This decision was made over a month ago, yet was only made public knowledge a few days ago. According to the blog post, the company was not too convinced whether they should work with either Bitcoin ABC or Bitcoin SV. Although ABC eventually regained the original BCH ticker, dealing with both versions of Bitcoin Cash was something EasyDNS simply didn\u2019t want to experiment with whatsoever. One could ask why they only took the decision at that time. Considering how the Bitcoin Cash protocol upgrade occurred well in advance, they could have potentially devised a strategy ahead of time. Even so, the final result is the exact same, as neither Bitcoin Cash nor Bitcoin SV will be accepted by EasyDNS now or in the foreseeable future. A bit of a \u201charsh\u201d decision first and foremost, although one could also see where this decision is coming from. It is important to note this particular development doesn\u2019t mean EasyDNS is turning its back on cryptocurrencies. In fact, the company made the surprising decision to introduce another altcoin as a supported payment method. Replacing Bitcoin Cash will be Litecoin, the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold and a currency which has successfully built up a strong reputation over the years. It also took 10 minutes for the EasyDNS engineers to incorporate LTC payments. This is a pretty interesting development, for many different reasons. More specifically, EasyDNS is the first and only ICANN accredited registrar in the world to accept Litecoin payments. A big feather in the cap of the LTC community and a pretty big blow to the BCH holders. Even so, one has to wonder if Bitcoin Cash will be introduced as a payment method again in the near future. It seems unlikely at this point, yet one never knows what will come next.", "date": "2019-01-30T09:11:28+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 30}

Following the most recent price gains, this altcoin is now ranked #4th in terms of overall market cap, surpassing Bitcoin Cash. The current EOS price sits at $2.33, although it appears as if there is some room left for future growth over the coming days. It is evident nearly al cryptocurrencies, tokens, and digital assets rely on Bitcoin\u2019s price first and foremost. As such, one wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to see so much green across the price charts right now. Especially where EOS is concerned, the most recent market activity has seemingly been a lackluster. Even so, the altcoin surpassed Bitcoin Cash in market cap without too much effort. Over the past 24 hours, the EOS price increased by 1.57%. Because of this gain, one EOS is now valued at $2.33, or 66,946 Satoshi. Both of these gains are quite interesting to keep an eye on, even if they might not woo a lot of investors. It is evident there is a genuine interest in EOS right now, as the trading volume sits well above $800 million. On social media, it seems there is a lot of attention on OS right now. Pantera Capital\u2019s Paul Veradittakit released a new report regarding the dApps ecosystem on the EOS blockchain. All of the signs are very promising in this regard, as over 235 apps are active on the network today. It is evident this project brings strong competition to Ethereum, Tron, NEO, and others who want to facilitate the building of distributed applications. In other positive news, it appears BetKing is preparing to launch a new cryptocurrency exchange in the near future. Said platform will support major trading pairs and popular EOS and ETH tokens. This new project can ensure there will be even more liquidity for EOS as a whole in the near future. It is also interesting to see this popular gambling platform explore options on the exchange side of the spectrum. Last but not least, it would appear EOS continues to make inroads in the business sector. The tweet by Benjamin McKenna Finch shows EOS will find a market in the career center technology industry. A very interesting development, although it remains to be seen how big this impact will be once everything is said and done. New solutions need to be built and brought to market first and foremost. All of these signs point toward a rather bright future for EOS in many different ways. Whether or not any of these behind-the-scenes developments will affect the price in any way, remains to be determined.

Bitcoin has a finite amount of supply, which is capped at 21 million coins. There is no such thing as the government printing more money when it comes to bitcoin. No new coins can be made beyond the 21 million coins. This allows the mother cryptocurrency to be less inflationary than the annual inflation rate controlled by the central banks which usually progresses at about 2%. When bitcoin initially launched on January 3, 2009. It was set up to release 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes to miners. Every four years, the code halves, which drops the released coins to miners by half. So, on November 28, 2012, the coins released fell from 50 to 25. Then on July 9, 2016, it halved again, falling to 12.5 coins released every 10 minutes. Why is this significant? The next halving event is happening on May 25, 2020. That\u2019s next year! The amount of the reward to miners is going to be reduced again. This means a reduction in supply, and we know when supply drops, prices go up. Both times bitcoin halved in the past the price of bitcoin rose dramatically the previous year. Just looking at the year before the last half, we see bitcoin rose from $220 to $770, that\u2019s a 250% return. The time before that bitcoin price rose from $3.30 to $11.50, that\u2019s a 248% return. When we combine this with the fact that cryptocurrency infrastructure is being laid out at an accelerated rate, including Bakkt taking bitcoin mainstream, the future appears to consist of an economic environment where we have a restriction in supply and an increase in demand. This could be a huge event that results in a massive price spike. We still have a few months to go, and will likely see sideways to downward pressure testing the $3200 mark before things turn around, but the end of the pain now may be in sight. Also note, this does not mean all cryptocurrencies will recover. Unfortunately, many of the projects grossly mismanaged their ICO money, which has led to stagnation within the project. Without money most of these struggling projects will cease to exist, resulting in heartbreak for their investors. However, the projects that executed properly are going to pave the way for the future and will not only survive this latest downturn but will far exceed their previous highs.

Following some fresh gains, the Bitcoin SV price has now surpassed the $60 mark once again. A very interesting development, especially when considering how all other top markets are still under a lot of bearish pressure right now. Despite successfully rivaling Bitcoin Cash at one point, it is quite evident Bitcoin SV has lost most of its traction in rather quick succession. This was somewhat to be expected, albeit few people knew the gap between BCH and BSV would grow this wide in quick succession. Clawing back some of these losses will remain an ongoing struggle. However, there is some positive momentum brewing. Over the past 24 hours, the Bitcoin SV price has gained some lost value. The 4.2% increase brings the price back to just over $64, which is pretty interesting. There is also a 6.1% gain on Bitcoin, which is what one would expect to see from altcoins during an extended bear market. Sustaining this trend will prove to be very difficult, though. As has been the case for some time now, there is plenty of social media activity pertaining to Bitcoin SV. Kurt Wuckert Jr not only shares a viable message but also a great image to go along with it. While images like these won\u2019t necessarily score a lot of brownie points with the cryptocurrency community, it is still a remarkable piece of art in its own way. Bitbot is convinced Bitcoin SV is the \u201ctruth\u201d machine which will enforce transparency and accountability. Those are some very big claims to live up to for this particular project. Having Bitcoin in the name alone won\u2019t necessarily warrant government adoption now or in the future. There is plenty of work waiting to be done in this regard. Jereme Tayamen contemplates whether or not there is another potential Coinbase \u201ccontroversy\u201d shaping up behind the scenes. He is wondering if the company is liquidating its own BSV position prior to releasing the coins to the clients. It is a bit odd how the company still hasn\u2019t issued these coins to its rightful owners at this stage. That delay isn\u2019t uncommon for Coinbase whatsoever, though. As is always the case in the cryptocurrency world, everything depends on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum first and foremost. Right now, the Bitcoin price continues to get hammered first and foremost, which doesn\u2019t bode well for any altcoins or tokens on the market.

Most people own cryptocurrencies for investment and speculative purposes first and foremost. In terms of actually using them, the situation has become very different. It appears spending Bitcoin, tokens, assets, and altcoins remains an ongoing struggle as 2019 begins. Solving that problem will be quite challenging for obvious reasons. In the Bitcoin Cash world, the same problem persists. More specifically, it is not as easy as one might think. Despite having the support of processors like BitPay, CoinPayments, and others, it is still up to users to effectively pay with this altcoin. As long as there aren\u2019t more places to spend BCH, that may remain an ongoing struggle first and foremost. It would appear at least one community member acknowledges this problem and has come up with a potential solution. Two new services have been announced to bolster the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. One service is known as Porn.Cash, whereas the other will be Cinema.Cash. Both platforms serve a very similar purpose. The main objective is to build more platforms where content creators can publish their own videos and get paid for it. As one would expect, this will primarily improve upon the use of Bitcoin Cash as an actual currency. Content creators will benefit from two particular revenue streams. They can either opt for the pay per view model, or the \u201ctipping\u201d approach. It is safe to assume the former will generate more \u201cguaranteed\u201d revenue. However, most cryptocurrency users aren\u2019t necessarily interested in spending money on video content. As such, the tipping model can also prove to be very lucrative in its own regard. Having multiple options at one\u2019s disposal is always favorable. On paper, it may seem as if the tipping method might not prove to be worthwhile for most. To counter this potential problem, an incentive is created. Users will receive CASH tokens for every tip completed through either platform. These CASh tokens will also award holders with a share of all profits generated by the platform in question. A good way to ensure some initial traction will occur. However, the success of these projects is never guaranteed. Although one has to commend community members for building such projects, it also shows there is still a very long way to go. Despite being around for over 10 years now, Bitcoin still isn\u2019t even close to becoming mainstream. It seems all other currencies on the market face an even steeper uphill battle in this regard. For Bitcoin Cash, these two new projects may spark some initial excitement. Keeping the momentum going over the course of several months or years, however, will be nigh impossible without a solid business plan.", "date": "2019-02-05T15:00:37+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 5}

That in itself is pretty interesting, especially when considering how nearly all markets rely on Bitcoin first and foremost. In the case of the Litecoin price, things have gotten pretty interesting as of late. It is now back in the market cap top 5, after a lengthy struggle. Although most discussions in the cryptocurrency industry pertain to Bitcoin first and foremost, one should never ignore the other markets by any means. Albeit there is a good chance most of these currencies will continue to lean on Bitcoin for momentum, some unusual behavior can be noted every now and then. The recent Litecoin trend is a great example of how things can evolve on their own accord regardless of what Bitcoin is doing. Over the past 24 hours, the Litecoin price has risen by 1.7% in USD value and 1.9% in BTC value. Both of these trends are pretty peculiar to be noted at this time. This is also the first time in a while Litecoin enters the market cap top 5 again, as it successfully overtook Bitcoin Cash. With a current value of $33.85 or nearly 0.01 BTC, the current momentum looks very interesting regardless of how one wants to look at things. To put this in perspective, there is some genuine excitement regarding this recent \u201cflappening\u201d. That is the term people tend to use when Litecoin overtakes another major cryptocurrency in market cap. Mitchell Moos is quite taken by this particular development, although there is a good chance the rankings will switch again over the course of today. It would also appear the community is also awarding community members for their involvement in Litecoin these days. While that is a valid approach to raise some more attention, it seems Logan Paul has gotten the \u201cweekly Litecoin MVP award\u201d. A peculiar development, although one that shouldn\u2019t necessarily influence the price in any significant manner. What is more intriguing is how Litecoin has successfully hit its one-month high. Considering how the overall bear market is still in full effect, one wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect a trend on this scale to materialize now or in the near future. Even so, the Litecoin gains are quite genuine as of right now, albeit one has to question if the trend can be sustained for more than a few hours on end. That will always be the primary concern. Although Litecoin has plenty of trading volume right now, it may not necessarily be sufficient to keep this train going for very long. After all, the Bitcoin pressure will get to all other markets regardless, yet Litecoin may try to stave off the seemingly inevitable for the coming hours. Reaching $35 might not necessarily happen anytime soon, but the 0.01 BTC level seems ripe for the taking. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

It is evident this doesn\u2019t bode well for any currency that isn\u2019t Bitcoin itself, even though that currency is also facing a steep uphill battle as of right now. For those who keep an eye on the Bitcoin Cash price, it appears things have gone from bad to worse fairly quickly. Sustaining the $110 level will not be easy by any means. Every single time Bitcoin loses value, all of the currencies derived from it will go through a similar bearish phase. Considering how Bitcoin Cash has tried to imitate Bitcoin over the past year or so, it is only normal it too faces the brunt of this bearish pressure. So far, the momentum has clearly turned against BCH, although that situation can still turn around at any given time. For now, however, the pressure will need to be endured first and foremost. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a massive Bitcoin Cash price change. Unfortunately for speculators and believers, it has not been a positive one. Following this net 11.5% decline in USD value and an 8.1% loss over Bitcoin, one BCH is now valued at just over $110. In Bitcoin terms, it sits at the 0.0319 level, although that may not act as stable support either. It did not take long for the cryptocurrency community to make some terrible jokes about this current price momentum. CryptoHunters was one of the first to label this as \u201cBitcoin Crash\u201d, a term often used to refer to Bitcoin Cash as well. It is evident Bitcoin is crashing a bit, although the massive decline some people would have expected still hasn\u2019t kicked in yet. As such, the momentum may continue to grow worse as more time progresses. It is also worth pointing out there is at least one positive development for the Bitcoin Cash gang. Roger Ver, the \u201cgodfather of BCH\u201d, celebrated his 40th birthday recently. Although it remains to be seen if it will be a day to remember given this current BCH value, the edibles certainly look to be in good shape. It will not affect the BCH value in the slightest, though. Last but not least, it would appear an interesting discussion is going on where BCH is concerned. The denomination for minor BCH transactions is causing some confusion, although it seems unlikely it will be changed in the future. As small amounts of Bitcoin Cash are transacted, referring to them as \u201cmBCH\u201d seems to be rather appropriate. An interesting debate to keep an eye on moving forward. Although no major developments are happening behind the scenes of Bitcoin Cash, it would appear the current negative trend has absolutely nothing to do with that particular aspect. Instead, it appears this most recent decline is merely a result of the ongoing Bitcoin price decline which has been going on for quite some time now. How low the BCH value will go in the coming hours, is difficult to predict. A decline to $100 isn\u2019t entirely out of the question at this point.

A lot of financial losses were sustained during this period. That is only normal, after the ludicrous end of year the market went through in 2017. A new report shows US investors lost nearly $2bn from trading Bitcoin alone. This allows for some interesting tax deduction options, though. Most US traders are seemingly unaware a net loss in Bitcoin trading can be quite lucrative. Although everyone prefers making money, the deficit can serve another purpose in a positive manner. In the United States, these financial losses can be deducted from one\u2019s tax filings. Although it will not offset the total losses sustained, it is still a form of recuperating some money in the process. More specifically, US traders lost $1.7bn through Bitcoin trading in 2018. That is a very high figure, but one that won\u2019t surprise too many traders either. The massive bearish pressure caused a significant Bitcoin price decline. All other tokens, assets, and currencies saw similar market trends last year, which is only normal. Credit Karma, the firm conducting this research, confirmed last year wasn\u2019t great. In fact, there were even unrealized losses of over $5bn. This further shows how much money can be made or lost with cryptocurrencies these days. What is rather remarkable is the approach US traders take to these losses. Rather than try to deduct them from their taxes, they simply let it slide. A very unusual development, considering the taxation guidelines in this country. Any net loss sustained from trading Bitcoin can be turned into a tax education. It is uncanny how few people actively pursue this option at this time. The company further explains: This in itself highlights a bit of a problem among US Bitcoin traders. The majority either doesn\u2019t want to \u2013 or doesn\u2019t know \u2013 they can file losses as part of their crypto taxes. Although a lot of traders are uncomfortable sharing this information with the IRS, it is evident any option needs to be explored in this regard. Especially when it comes to tax deductions, no options should be overlooked whatsoever. One also has to keep in mind the tax industry might be to blame for this, albeit partially. Bitcoin still remains a very delicate subject. Most accountants don\u2019t even know how to handle this asset either, which makes the current situation a bit more logical. Something will need to change to ensure Bitcoin traders deduct these losses in the future. As the year 2019 is shaping up to be rather bearish as well, this information may become rather handy in the future. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Now that the hash war with Bitcoin SV is fully over, it seems things are going back to normal. This also means the Bitcoin Cass price still has a long road to recovery ahead in the months and years to come. Today\u2019s gains show there is some positive momentum brewing, for the time being. After facing a serious beating throughout 2018, Bitcoin Cash has not been the same ever since. Not only did the coin lose a lot of value, but the fight with Bitcoin SV also caused a lot of problems along the way. It now seems most of those issues are in the past where they belong and the time has come to look toward the future. What that future will hold for BCH, is a different matter altogether. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a minor increase in the Bitcoin Cash value. A 3.1% gain in USD value and a 3.7% increase in BCH/BTC show this altcoin is far from dead. All of this is happening with just under $285m in trading volume, which is more than respectable. Due to these increases, one BCH is valued at $133.68 or 0.0372 BTC again. An interesting trend, although some holders would have expected much bigger things from this altcoin. The value of any cryptocurrency network can be determined by the rate at which development occurs. In the case of Bitcoin Cash, it would appear several improvement proposals are currently under review or being worked on. All of these changes can introduce some positive changes to the ecosystem as a whole. This also confirms there is a genuine interest in making the project more versatile. When looking at the current price momentum, one has to acknowledge things can easily swing either way over the coming hours. Crypto Tone Loc is convinced there may be a very bullish short-term trend, assuming the market doesn\u2019t collapse entirely in the next few hours. A rather hopeful outlook, as no uptrend has been sustained in any market for quite some time now. Crypto Beri is also looking at the current BCH price, although this user identifies some interesting levels. The main question is whether or not the support in BCH/BTC will hold near the current levels, as that could yield a push to the 0.039 range in the near future. If the support is tested, however, things may not necessarily look all that great. All things considered, this positive momentum seems to be on rather shaky legs. That is not just a problem for Bitcoin Cash, as it affects all other markets in a very similar manner. Until Bitcoin breaks out in bullish fashion, the other currencies will not see any sustainable gains either. That means the value per Bitcoin Cash may very well head back to $130 and lower in the very near future. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

The Cardano price has already lost over 7% in just a few hours. It is expected this trend will continue throughout the day, as Bitcoin\u2019s value is tanking as well. This is not the development Cardano holders are hoping for, yet there is no recourse as of right now. Whenever the value of Bitcoin goes in the red, all other markets will follow pretty quickly. This is the unfortunate side of cryptocurrency. Every other market relies on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum, even though some communities will gladly claim otherwise. In the case of Cardano, it is evident this altcoin will only note momentum when something happens to Bitcoin. That works both ways, and the current momentum is very negative. Over the past few hours, there has been a 7.2% Cardano price decline. Because of this big setback, one ADA is currently valued at $0.0426, which is not necessarily what investors and speculators would like to see right now. There is also a 3.1% decline in the ADA/BTC ratio. That is very peculiar, as now is a good time for altcoins and tokens to gain on Bitcoin in spectacular fashion. It appears Cardano is incapable of doing so. There is some positive news affecting Cardano which should keep diehard investors quite happy. The Atomic Wallet for Android has been released earlier this week. Additionally, it seems they will implement Cardano support as early as next week. Mobile cryptocurrency wallet solutions are in high demand right now, and having one\u2019s currency supported by these projects can pave the way for much broader adoption in general. It doesn\u2019t happen all that often a very troublesome \u201cmeme\u201d is poste don Twitter, at least where Cardano is concerned. The message shared by the Windy Buffalo, while amusing, also shows there is some bias toward Charles Hoskinson and his \u201cskills. The actual intent of this Tweet remains unclear as of right now, but it has a more negative tone to it first and foremost. It shouldn\u2019t bother too many Cardano investors, though. A meme a day keeps all of the bad juju away, at least in the cryptocurrency world.CryptoBu777 is doing his part in this regard by sharing a very funny meme involving Tom Hanks. One can only hope all discussions will turn to talking about the moon and lambos again. Unfortunately, the current market momentum only warrants debates regarding Matchbox cars and photoshopped moons. Although today\u2019s market momentum is not necessarily a long-term indicator, one has to keep in mind this current momentum isn\u2019t looking very promising whatsoever. It is very likely the Cardano value will continue to drop even further in the future, although no one knows where the exact bottom will be. The lack of gains in ADA/BTC is perhaps the most worrisome trend right now, although that situation can always turn around on a dime. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

More often than not, predictions need to be taken with a grain of salt. As far as the year 2019 is concerned, here is a rather mixed bag of opinions as to what will happen to this industry. Most people are familiar with the name Fred Wilson, as he is a well-known cryptocurrency price watcher. Earlier in the year, he expected the volatility in this industry associated with the bearish pressure to come to an end. So far, it seems that prediction has come true. Whether or not the markets are effectively out of the woods already, is a different matter altogether. The bigger question is what will happen now that the markets appear to be on the mend again. Sustaining this slow and steady level of growth would be good, but that is easier said than done. Wilson also hinted at how this year may be the turning point to determine which crypto-tokens are here to stay. Real results may take months to materialize, and there could be more bullish runs along the way. Most cryptocurrency enthusiasts will be quite happy with the way Bitcoin has performed in the past few months. After the long and painful drop from $19,000 down to the $3,000 range, it would appear the bulls are back in town at this time. As a result, the value surpassed $5,000 without too many problems Those who kept a close eye on the prediction shared by six fintech experts earlier in the year may recall this surge was somewhat expected. Ben Ritchie claimed Bitcoin can go as high as $9.500 in 2019, which would require another near 50% increase over the coming 7 months. Not entirely impossible to achieve, although it is apparent there is a lot of work to be done. The so-called \u201cdecoupling of cryptocurrencies\u201d is another crucial aspect to look out for in this industry. So far, no real progress has been made in that department. Albeit this particular prediction isn\u2019t taken seriously by most people, there has been a cult following for the \u201cXRP to $589\u201d meme on the internet. Given all of the developments happening behind the scenes of Ripple, there is no real reason why the value of XRP won\u2019t increase. Reaching a value of $589 seems virtually impossible, although one has to keep in mind this asset is not following the same rules as cryptocurrencies per se. When it comes to finance, big numbers are a lot easier to achieve than some people may think. Although not many people may want to hear it, there is still some firm belief the Ethereum price will tank in the near future. This was reiterated once again by a chart shared by Ratpatrol this week. That user genuinely expects ETH to retest the wick at $11 and change. Given the current value of ETH, that would seem rather unlikely, although one never really knows what the future will bring. It is a valid prediction like any other, albeit one that needs to be taken with a few grains of salt, like any other. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Since this is one of the best-performing tokens on the market today, it is only normal so many people will try to make good money with BNB. Even today, the uptrend still appears to be in effect, although one has to wonder if the value can hit $23 or higher before the sentiment reverses course. Although bullish momentum is not uncommon in the cryptocurrency industry, it doesn\u2019t happen all that often one specific market remains subject to this momentum for months on end. In the case of Binance Coin, there has not been a lack of bullish momentum for quite some time now, despite a few dips and bruises along the way. For traders and speculators, this is a gift that keeps on giving in many different ways. To put this in perspective, the Binance Coin price has risen by another 4.82% to elevate its value to $22.81. There is also a 3.34% improvement in BNB/BTC and a 4.81% gain in BNB/ETH. All of these signs confirm the interest in this token hasn\u2019t diminished in the slightest, albeit one has to wonder how long things can continue along these lines. As long as the overall trading volume remains at its current level \u2013 or even rises slightly \u2013 there is a chance a push to $23 might materialize throughout this week. Even though the BNB price is still heading in the right direction, some people are not too happy with what is going on Binance itself. Especially when it comes to BTT/BTC trading, there appear to be plenty of \u201codd\u201d sell walls. Andy Sheu claims this is the fault of Binance\u2019s CEO for not putting this activity to an end. It remains to be seen if such allegations will influence the BNB price in any way, though. In completely different news, it would appear BNB will be subjected for margin trading in the near future. According to some information Reddit, it would appear both the BNB/BTC and BNB/USDT pairs will become eligible, along with 7 other trading pairs. It will be interesting to see how things will play out in this regard, as margin trading can create a lot of price volatility for any of the supported pairs. Regardless of everything going on behind the scenes, it appears Bitcoin Florida Gator is more than happy with the way things are going right now. This user is pleased to see the BNB price move up again, after the recent push to $25 was rejected in a rather violent manner. Whether or not there will be another attempt at breaking that resistance level in the near future, is rather difficult to predict as of right now. For those cryptocurrency traders looking to make a quick buck, it would appear Binance Coin remains one of the more solid options as of right now. How long that situation will remain in place, is a different matter altogether, as Binance Coin has been on a bullish run for as long as most people can remember.

Not entirely surprising when considering how law enforcement agencies are actively cracking down on these illicit services. Wall Street Market, a platform recently thought to have exit scammed, has been taken over by German and Dutch law enforcement agencies. Three Germans have been arrested to date. Although it is not impossible for darknet marketplaces to fly under the radar for several years on end, it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so in a successful manner. Since most of the top markets have been either taken over, deleted, or simply disappeared, there seems to be a revolving door of new platforms popping up these days. Wall Street Market once started as an unknown platform, yet it rose to the top 15 in recent months. Because of this surge in popularity, Wall Street Market eventually got the attention of law enforcement agencies. For some time, it was suspected this platform was in German hands. Those findings were eventually confirmed, as German officials have arrested three suspects earlier this week. The Bundeskriminalamt is now in control of the .onion domain, the Bitcoin wallets, and the user database. This internationally coordinated action was made possible with the help of agencies in the Netherlands, the United States, and Europol. It also marks another key takedown of a top darknet marketplace, as the net is closing very quickly around these marketplaces since a few years. Rest assured this is not the final marketplace to be taken over by law enforcement officials either. Over the past two weeks, very conflicting rumors regarding Wall Street Market came to surface. Some users claimed one of the moderators was blackmailing users. Others claim the team behind WSM exit scammed and stole several millions worth of Bitcoin in the process. It is unclear which \u2013 if any \u2013 of these claims is effectively true. This takeover by law enforcement agencies puts everything into a completely different spotlight. At the same time, it is possible this operation was accelerated because of the exit scam rumors. The investigation into WSM started back in 2017. As the owners were attempting to exit scam, it is possible authorities decided to pull the trigger a bit sooner than expected. None of this has officially been confirmed at this time, however. It is also believed over 200 of the WSM users have the Dutch nationality. That would explain why the Netherlands are involved in this operation. While a lot of information regarding this development remains unknown, officials will share more details this coming Friday. They may confirm the exact number of arrests or even shed light on how this operation came to be. For the three individuals in custody, there appears to be sufficient evidence to link them to WSM. They now face charges including money laundering and trafficking narcotics. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/dogecoin-price-notes-solid-gains-as-coinbase-wallet-support-goes-live/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Dogecoin Price Notes Solid Gains as Coinbase Wallet Support Goes Live", "content": "When it comes to different altcoins on the market today, traders often keen an eye on Dogecoin. While this is still considered to be the joke currency of the internet, the market cap of DOGE tends to remain fairly stable. Now that the Dogecoin price is on the rise again, it is certainly possible all of the other markets will head in the same direction moving forward. Although the past few days have not been overly negative for any of the cryptocurrency markets, it is always good to see some positive momentum brewing behind the scenes. When even Dogecoin can inch ahead, it is only a matter of time until the other markets attempt to follow the same. As long as Bitcoin remains in the green, there is no reason to expect a market reversal. Over the past 24 hours, the Dogecoin price has risen by 3.15%, Because of this somewhat unexpected gain, the value per DOGE has now reached $0.002568 once again. At the same time, the DOGE/BTC ratio has improved by 1.65%, as the 47 Satoshi level has been reclaimed successfully. All of these developments are more than promising under the current market circumstances. However, it seems unlikely DOGE will return to $0.003 anytime soon. The big news of the week so far is how Dogecoin is now officially supported by the Coinbase Wallet service. In most cases, that could hint at DOGE becoming available for trading on Coinbase in the near future, albeit the exchange has neither confirmed nor denied this is happening as of yet. Even so, it is evident the support by Coinbase Wallet will help legitimize Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency despite the public\u2019s perception. Scrippins is one of those people who expect big things from this Coinbase Wallet news. Although other supported coins have seen their fair share of value increases, it remains to be seen if Dogecoin will receive a similar treatment. After all, there are dozens of billions of DOGE in circulation, and triggering a major market surge will be increasingly difficult. Even so, one never knows how its market will evolve in the coming days and weeks. Despite all of the positive news, it seems some people are still not too convinced Dogecoin should be considered a legitimate project. Bill Warren, for example, is still convinced Dogecoin is a joke, as he cannot make sense of the current market cap of over $300m. While not everyone might take Dogecoin too seriously, it is evident this project will not disappear no matter how badly some people may want it to. When looking at the bigger picture, it would appear most of the cryptocurrency markets are in a very good place as of right now. As far as Dogecoin is concerned, this gain could very well remain in place for a while, albeit a bigger jump might not necessarily materialize in the near future. Despite the Coinbase Wallet listing, it seems unlikely a push to $0.003 will materialize anytime soon. That is not necessarily a bad thing either.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/what-is-lightning-hosted/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "What is Lightning Hosted?", "content": "In the cryptocurrency world, there is never a shortage of new and interesting projects. Some of these ventures will be more successful than others, although most of the offerings will find their niche market sooner or later. Lightning Hosted is perhaps one of the more interesting projects as of late, although it might not necessarily appeal to everyone. On the surface, the exact purpose of Lightning Hosted might not make too much sense just yet. However, this image hosting service which uses Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network could certainly prove to be useful in the long run. The main purpose is to effectively create a way to share advertising revenue with users accordingly. The Lightning Network is quite versatile in its own right, although this is not necessarily the kind of service people would expect to see at this stage. There are a few interesting aspects to Lightning Hosted. First of all, users can upload images, yet they will have to pay a small fee to do so. This payment is done through Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network, which should prevent people from abusing this service as a whole. Although it remains to be seen if this approach will be successful in that regard, the service is still in beta and all of its aspects remain subject to change moving forward. Once the user has uploaded their preferred image, they will receive a dedicated link. Said link will display the image alongside Bitcoin-related advertisements. The person responsible for uploading the image will receive a portion of the revenue generated by those advertisements. It is an interesting business model for all parties involved, although it is still somewhat early to determine if any good money can be made from exploring this particular service. As one would come to expect, the platform\u2019s owners will maintain a strict policy as to what can be uploaded. Any illegal images \u2013 including copyrighted ones \u2013 will be prohibited. That makes a lot of sense, as those images could also pose genuine problems for the advertisers in question. Since everything is taken care of by a third party on behalf of the image uploader, it is only normal they will enforce specific rules upon its users. When newer services like these launch, there will always be questions as to how services like these can keep growing and evolving. For Lightning Hosted, there are still a lot of unanswered questions in this regard. While anyone with a Bitcoin-focused project who wants to advertise can become an official sponsor of this platform, it may take a while until users can generate a somewhat decent revenue stream from this business model. Recouping the initial cost of uploading the image will be the main objective, but it is still too early to determine how long that will take at this time. One thing that is for sure is how the team has no plans to add additional cryptocurrencies to Lightning Hosted. Even though Bitcoin is not the only currency with Lightning Network potential, this particular service will focus on the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency first and foremost. One upside of this service is how it doesn\u2019t require personal information from its users. Whether that will be enough to get more people excited about Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network, is difficult to determine. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

In fact, global Bitcoin mining alone has transcended the energy consumption of some nations including Ireland in recent years. Evidently, the environmental impact of this enormous processing requirement has still not been accounted for by the crypto-landscape. The REBGLO is a digital currency project that works with the concept of \u2018Reboot Globalization\u2019 and \u2018Reproduction and Globalization.\u2019 The project aims to leverage state-of-the-art technology to bring an eco-friendly approach towards crypto-mining process and offer greater efficiency and economic benefits. REBGLO intends to accomplish its objectives via its powerful solutions that include:- Typically in a traditional crypto-mining process, miners have to read and reconstruct the collected data across multiple unoccupied spaces on the disc, making it a complex and lengthy process. This system is primarily designed to solve scalability issues and reduce power consumption in cryptocurrency mining. When tested the technology exhibited a 17.2% improvement in hash/s. Benefits of using DTS system in virtual cryptocurrency mining:- By accumulating all the relevant data for processing on the central memory, and integrating it with instruction parallelization during the crypto-mining process, DTS improves the operational performance on a higher level. DTS system allows miners to gain mining income at higher levels than combinations including conventional mining software and mining computers. REBGLO is an unconventional electromagnetic sticker that adjusts elementary particles into a constitution state. Once collected, these particles develop a protective layer that opposes electromagnetic noise, which is responsible for reducing the battery longevity. HETTARER stickers were developed in Japan. They basically use conductive paper to gather the charged particles from electric currents emitting from the device and air naturally. These stickers come with a lifespan of 60 days and are currently available for smartphones and many other battery-operated gadgets via http://hettarer.biz/shop. Furthermore, these particles are then enhanced by the heat occurring from the battery, that offers subdued charging times and elongated battery life. By solely applying the sticker on the back of the device, users can improve the overall battery performance by 20-40%. These effective hacks can also be used on car batteries and other battery-operated household appliances. HETTARER can also be leveraged to reduce the high frequency of electric devices by 90%, thereby notably doubling the efficiency of the crypto-mining. HETTARER sticker is proven to improve both data mining speed and its results. The statistics showed that within the span of 24 hours, the sticker revealed a 133% increase in Monero data mining and a 114% improvement in Monero mining within 48-hours by multi-currency mining pool of MinerGate. REBGLO project aims to offer effective and powerful software as well as hardware solutions in order to improve the existing cryptocurrency mining process. The company in near future aims enter into the \u2018Electric Power Business\u2019 and \u2018Energy\u2019 business and develop its own electric power company. Through its efforts, the company plans to address environmental issues associated with crypto-mining as well as extend the landscape a more efficient mining environment that reduces the complexities and increasing the chances of making better profits.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/what-is-alagoria/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "What is Alagoria?", "content": "Making cryptocurrencies more useful in everyday life remains one of the major hurdles for this industry. Considering how Bitcoin is not accepted as an official payment method for most products and services, it is only normal alternative solutions need to be explored. Alagoria aims to become a top service in this regard, although it remains to be seen how successful the venture will be. Users are advised to conduct their own research prior to entrusting their money to third-party service providers. Older Bitcoin users have seen many services come and gone over the past decade. Any platform trying to make it easier for consumers to spend Bitcoin for everyday shopping has seen its fair share of struggles. Not necessarily because the idea isn\u2019t solid, but rather because not everyone is interested in spending their Bitcoin or altcoin holdings. Especially when the markets turn bearish, the desire to spend cryptocurrency becomes increasingly rare. The big question is whether services like Alagoria can change that narrative. Their business model is similar to Purse, as the team aims to offer a decent discount on items purchased. Whereas Purse tries to cater to Amazon users, Alagoria targets Home Depot and Walmart customers. An interesting decision, which may find some traction as more time progresses. A 10% discount is nothing to sneeze at, even if it just pertains to two major chains in the United States. Using Alagoria seems to be straightforward. The platform lets users buy anything from Walmart or Home Depot. Users need to copy the product URL onto the website, or simply browse the products listed on the main page. By completing the checkout process and making the cryptocurrency payment, the team will then place the same order on the retailer\u2019s own website. Users will be notified regarding the shipment of their order and receive a tracking number if available. On paper, this might not seem viable to offer customers a 10% discount. To counter that concern, the Alagoria team actively buys up discounted gift cards from either Walmart or Home Depot. Where those cards are sourced from, has not been confirmed at this time. This business model is similar to the Fold app, which also offers discounts because they buy discounted gift cards for Starbucks purchases. Depending on the availability of discounted gift cards, the Alagoria team might struggle to offer its services at certain times. As one would come to expect, the Alagoria service primarily caters to customers in the United States. Walmart and Home Depot are US-based chains, and they will not ship their goods overseas. While the Alagoria team recommends international clients to use a package forward service, it remains to be seen if anyone decides to look into that option for just a 10% discount. Those savings will often be offset by paying for a package forwarder. In terms of supported cryptocurrencies, users have four different options to choose from. Bitcoin is the main payment option, although Alagoria also supports Litecoin, ZCash, and Bitcoin Cash. A solid selection of currencies which can effectively be expanded upon in the future if the service proves to be a success. The service itself also has a lot of TrustPilot reviews for users to check out. All of those are either \u201cgreat\u2019, or \u201cexcellent\u201d. Interestingly enough, previous reviews mention \u201cAmazon purchases\u201d and \u201cMonero payments\u201d, neither of which are seemingly available at the time of writing.

Whereas the top markets still look on wobbly legs, the Binance Coin price simply remains slightly bearish. The losses are not insurmountable by any means, yet one has to wonder when that push to $25 will be resumed. Not too many people should be surprised to see Binance Coin is still in the red right now. As Bitcoin is still uncertain in which direction to head in, it is only normal the alternative markets show very similar momentum. Contrary to people\u2019s expectations, BNB is \u2013 at this time \u2013 incapable of bucking the overall trend. That situation may remain in place for at least a few more hours to come, depending on what happens to Bitcoin. To be more specific, the Binance Coin price is currently down by 092%, as it sits at $22.65. Still, a pretty decent value which is very close to the all-time high price. There are also losses over Bitcoin \u2013 1.24% \u2013 and Ethereum \u2013 0.6% \u2013 which don\u2019t necessarily bode well for the future. Even so, the overall momentum seems to indicate this dip will be overcome eventually, albeit no one really knows when that will happen exactly. On social media, there is a lot of focus on the BNB chart at this time. That won\u2019t necessarily come as too much of a surprise, primarily because this market has allowed so many traders to make a lot of money in the past few months. Ekene Paul is convinced now is the time to buy the BNB dip, albeit he also acknowledges it may take days or weeks to rise in value. A somewhat honest outlook on how Binance Coin\u2019s market trend looks right now Mihir Naik, on the other hand, has no real confidence Binance Coin\u2019s price will be moving up in a significant manner today. He likes what the four-hour chart offers, but the weekly indicators are still very weak or even downright bearish. Unless today proves to be a good day overall, there is no real indicator things will turn bullish in the near future. It is still an interesting market to keep an eye on regardless. Regardless of how the market may look as of right now, there will always be people on Twitter who attempt to shill their favorite currency. In the case of PSolutions, they still promotee BNB and the Binance exchange for being \u201cworthwhile and trustworthy\u201d. While most people might agree with that sentiment, one has to take these messages with a few pinches of salt. There are numerous worthwhile projects out there, and BNB will eventually hit a glass ceiling in terms of pricing. For the time being, it remains somewhat difficult to predict what the future will hold for Binance Coin. Right now, it is pretty evident there is a lot of bearish pressure, but that can be overcome with a nudge in trading volume and Bitcoin slightly recovering. Only time will tell which of these aspects \u2013 if either \u2013 will come true today or later this week. Uneasy market momentum will continue to dominate most markets for some time to come, by the look of things. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

In some cases, the trend will be bearish, while other markets turn mega bullish at the same time. Today, the IOTA price seems to be headed down an interesting bullish path, as its gains are quite steep already. Sustaining such a level of growth will be pretty challenging, though. Even though Bitcoin is not necessarily heading in a decisive direction just yet, it would appear some of the alternative markets are eager to move up again. IOTA Is a very interesting example in this regard, as its value has effectively surged pretty hard in quick succession. This is in stark contrast to most of the crypto market top 15, as all of those other markets are either slightly bearish or maintain a status quo. As far as the IOTA price is concerned, today has proven to be a fascinating day already. With a 17.4% gain in USD value, one MIOTA is now valued at $0.318627. There is also a near 17% increase in MIOTA/BTC, as this ratio has now been elevated to 6,010 Satoshi. A very prominent turn of events, although it would appear the overall trading volume isn\u2019t necessarily keeping up with this value increase. That may prove to be a hindrance as the day progresses. The big news to kick off this new week comes in the form of a major partnership between IOTA and Jaguar, the car manufacturer. It would appear Jaguar has plans to make use of IOTA\u2019s technology in one way or another. However, that doesn\u2019t mean they will use MIOTA directly, nor will there automatically be an increase in the demand for this currency either. Even so, it has triggered a massive price spike, which might reverse course once all of the excitement calms down once again. For those who keep a close eye on the IOTA chart, the current momentum might not necessarily make too much sense. Lunar Express claims there may very well be a small retrace sooner rather than later, as bulls might struggle to break through the next resistance level accordingly. Even so, a potential rise to $0.41 or even $0.52 is not necessarily impossible to achieve in the coming weeks and months. A similar chart is shared by pure&co, as this user seems to expect the IOTA pump to continue for quite some time to come. However, there will be a limit as to how high this market can go in one straight push, as the day is still young and a lot of people might be looking to cash out their profits accordingly. Even so, there is also a chance this may be a sign of what is yet to come throughout the remainder of 2019. Some bullish momentum will be welcomed with open arms. When looking at the bigger picture, one has to keep in mind Bitcoin will dictate the pace for all of the alternative markets at any given time. As of right now, Bitcoin\u2019s price trend remains rather uncertain, which can be somewhat problematic as far as IOTA\u2019s current price run is concerned. Even so, today is already shaping up to be an interesting day for cryptocurrency markets, although it is still too early to draw any real conclusions.

While most markets tend to keep their value stable, the Ravencoin price is retracing once again. An interesting turn of events, although things are not necessarily looking good. It is not entirely abnormal for alternative markets to lose one value over the course of the weekend. Although the top markets are in the green right now, it would appear some of the lower-ranked altcoins are not benefiting from this spell. Ravencoin is an interesting example in this regard, albeit not necessarily for the right reasons. Over the past 24 hours, the Ravencoin price has lost 5% in UD value and 5.82% in BTC value. Both of these developments push the RVN price down to $0.052814, or 996 Satoshi. Traders and holders will not be too happy with how things are going, although there isn\u2019t much to warrant an uptrend. On social media, there are a lot of interesting discussions pertaining to different altcoins right now. CryptoAK is quite pleased with the progress Ravencoin has shown in recent months, and it seems he expects other coins to follow suit in this regard. Whether or not that vision will come true, is a different matter altogether. When looking at the Ravencoin chart, it is pretty evident the current trend is not all that awe-inspiring. In fact, Posty expects a drop to 900 Satoshi or even lower, which is not necessarily something to look forward to. However, there may also be an uptrend to 1,100 Satoshi when people least expect it, which makes for an interesting outlook. CryptoFibonacci maintains a very different outlook on Ravencoin these days. He expects the support line to hold as of right now, albeit there is a genuine chance this level will break fairly soon. The coming hours may prove to be rather crucial for Ravencoin, although the current direction remains unclear. All of the signs seem to indicate Ravencoin\u2019s bearish pressure might not necessarily relent for quite some time to come. With a 5% drop already in place, there may be some panic selling over the coming hours and days. If Bitcoin were to turn bearish, this situation could grow even worse where RVN is concerned.

Many people are somewhat surprised by how the Litecoin price remains subjected to a negative spiral. While its price is still rather solid, it seems the expected push to $100 will have to wait for at least a few more days. With Bitcoin\u2019s price direction remaining unclear, no one really knows what the future will hold for the alternative markets. Litecoin, while often resilient under any given circumstance, is not having the easiest of times either. There is a rather surprising amount of bearish pressure on LTC right now, as its price currently sits just below $70. To put this in perspective, the past 24 hours have yielded a 3.94% Litecoin price decline across the board. Its USD value now sits at $69.9, whereas the BTC ratio has dropped to 0.0132 Bitcoin again. For now, no real damage has been done just yet, but if this pressure keeps up, the value may go a fair bit lower in quick succession. On social media, there are plenty of contradicting expectations as far as the future Litecoin value is concerned. Lunar Express predicts a death cross to haunt this market over the coming days, as the bullish divergence has seemingly run its course. Not a promising outlook, albeit one that is hard to argue with. For those who want something more optimistic, Daniel has an interesting message for Litecoin enthusiasts. He sees bullish charts for Litecoin and Bitcoin, although there will be a minor pullback first and foremost. This could yield some exciting LTC price momentum next week, albeit predictions are only accurate if enough people believe in them to make it come true. The bigger news to look forward to is how Litecoin will undergo a block reward halving later this year. This event is scheduled to occur in roughly 100 days from today, thus there is a chance investors may begin accumulating LTC. Hopium is a powerful tool in the cryptocurrency world, yet one has to keep the faith during these trying times. All things considered, it would appear things are looking neither bad nor good as far as Litecoin is concerned. That will leave a lot of traders and holders uncertain as to what they should be looking forward to. For those with a long-term view, the block halving can make some market shifts happen in the coming three months. Keep in mind that momentum can easily swing either way.

Even Dogecoin price discussions have become less frequent, which is highly unusual for this popular altcoin. It is now a matter of recovering some lost value first and foremost, which may take a while. It has been a fairly brutal week for most, if not all cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin\u2019s surprising dip in the red has triggered an avalanche of losses for all alternative markets. While Dogecoin is usually rather resilient in this regard, it too noted some losses along the way. As of right now, the market tries to stabilize itself and claw back some of those losses at the same time. As far as the Dogecoin price is concerned, it currently sits at $0.002512 following a 1.63% gain. Such a rise in value is rather prominent for DOGE, as it is one of the more stable markets in the industry as a whole. Most traders are interested to see where DOGE/BTC will end up at, as this ratio now sits at just 48 Satoshi. A rise to 50 or more would certainly spark some excitement. Similar to most markets, it seems Dogecoin suffers from a minor lull in trading volume. While $28.18m in volume is not necessarily impressive, it might be sufficient to let Dogecoin turn into a $300m market cap project once again. Noting any gains beyond that point will be a different matter, as the weekend is not even halfway yet. On social media, there is a very interesting DOGE price prediction. Alex King keeps people updated by claiming how 1 DOGE is still 1 DOGE. That is a most astute observation, although its USD and BTC value tends to fluctuate a fair bit at this time. Those who are not too concerned with short-term profits will be happy to know one DOGE remains one DOGE at all times. It has been a while since a good Dogecoin meme was shared with the public. AmpFury has people covered in this regard, as this particular meme is both funny and adorable at the same time. It seems even doges are interested in trading Dogecoin and watching the associated price chart. All things considered, it would appear there is plenty of rehabilitation affecting most of the top crypto markets. The one downside is how Bitcoin is still on very wobbly legs, thus there is a chance a new wave of bearish pressure will materialize sooner or later. Dogecoin is not out of the woods yet, but that is part of what makes this industry so exciting. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

There is also the actual business model, which provides a faster browsing experience, rewards from contributors to content creators directly, and an option to get either rid of ads or get paid to watch them. All of these aspects make Brave a very prominent solution for Internet users around the world, even though the project will struggle to rival Chrome, Firefox, and even Edge. Earlier this week, the Brave team also began rolling out the option for users to earn BAT tokens for viewing ads. One downside to this aspect is how ads are only available in specific regions right now, which has already caused a fair bit of friction among enthusiasts. However, this is only normal when such a compelling feature is rolled out in quick succession, as the rest of the world will be benefit from this technology in the future as well. Moreover, there are some concerns as to how the BAT rewards will affect the Basic Attention Token price. Depending on how users control their earnings, there is a good chance most tokens will be sold on the open market. The same goes for recipients of BAT tips, as the token itself cannot be used other than for tipping others and trading it for Bitcoin and other currencies. It will be interesting to see if the Brave team comes up with some form of a solution in that regard. As is rather normal in the world of open source projects, Brave\u2019s code has already been forked by the Gab team. This group of individuals sees merit in what Brave has to offer, yet they are clearly no fan of the Basic Attention Token implementation whatsoever. This may be a minor Bitcoin Maximalist attitude, yet there are plenty of people who would prefer to earn Bitcoin for viewing ads, rather than a token with very limited use cases at this time. As such, the Gab team\u2019s forked version of Brave will include some major changes. First of all, the team wants to introduce a \u201cfree speech app store\u201d, which will be very interesting to keep an eye on. They also plan to fully integrate Bitcoin payments powered by the Lightning Network, which is something many people seem to favor. Even though the Lightning Network is still in its infancy, adding it to a browser can certainly help accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin as a payment method. As one would come to expect, there is a bit of a \u201cwar\u201d going on between Brave\u2019s Brendan Eich and the Gab team. The latter wonders if Eich is effectively building a browser for consumers, or simply caters to advertisers. These opposite points of view are very interesting in their own regard. In the end, consumers get more choices, although making them switch to a different browser will remain a crucial challenge first and foremost. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/panxora-safeguards-ico-assets-with-crypto-treasury-management-service/", "author": "Guest", "title": "Panxora Safeguards ICO Assets with Crypto Treasury Management Service", "content": "April, 2019, London, UK \u2013 The Panxora Group, a cryptocurrency consortium, today announces the launch of its ICO Treasury Management Service (TMS). The TMS helps founders manage the capital raised through token generation events to ensure that it is preserved from the volatility of cryptocurrency and can support business growth. Recent research has shown that over half of ICOs fail within four months of their launch, often due to financial mismanagement. For young crypto companies, managing ICO capital is a daunting task. Keeping it in crypto exposes it to volatility and risks loss while converting it immediately to fiat could mean a missed opportunity to take advantage of a rising crypto market. In response, Panxora has launched the TMS to help crypto projects face the challenge of managing the funds they raise. Gavin Smith, CEO of Panxora said: Over Smith\u2019s 20 years\u2019 experience in investment banking and commodities, he saw the big players regularly using hedging strategies to tackle volatility. This not only preserves value, but can also represent upwards of 50% of the commodity company\u2019s yearly profits. Commodity markets and cryptocurrency share many characteristics so he saw an opportunity to create a competitive advantage for his ICO clients by transferring this expertise to the cryptocurrency industry. Using active hedge strategies based on AI trading algorithms, coupled with passive hedge balancing, the TMS can create a balance between capital growth and preservation, depending on the risk appetite of each client. The client dictates how much capital they need each month, which they can transfer into their operating account, ensuring that they can finance daily operations. Panxora\u2019s AI models were used to manage $2,900,000 raised during Panxora\u2019s Tessier-Ashpool token sale in 2017. After 15 months of trading, the company moved $2,100,000profit into an operating account, invested in 5 companies, ran the business for 15 months and still had the original $2,900,0000 plus an extra $200,000 sitting in the bank. Dynamic hedge management generated an increase of 76% during a period in which Bitcoin was down 16%. Gavin Smith concluded: \u201cHaving a plan in place for responsible management of a token\u2019s assets is not just good for the company itself. It\u2019s a signal to investors that says: we\u2019re serious about making this business work, taking responsibility for the capital you\u2019ve entrusted to us. We think this is an important step forward in the maturation of the token industry.\u201d About Panxora Founded in 2014 under the name First Global Credit, Panxora has always aimed to provide cryptocurrency owners the same opportunities as fiat currency holders have to generate revenue from their assets. With significant experience both in traditional financial and cryptocurrency markets, Panxora\u2019s co-founders brought their first service \u2013 crypto backed stock and ETF trading to market, followed shortly by its currency exchange and the launch of the investment collective, AICoin which uses proprietary AI to trade the cryptocurrency markets. The company\u2019s development team continues to innovate new products and services that will provide advantages to its customers. This includes the public launch of Panxora Crypto AI, a cryptocurrency focused hedge fund. This and other services have been designed to give crypto-asset holders ever more opportunities. With more than 30,000 customers in 35 countries, Panxora is the crypto-community\u2019s trusted partner to meet financial goals and put crypto-assets to work.

Whereas consumers were among the first wave of \u201ctargets'< it now seems most of these attempts are shifting to a completely different audience. The vast majority of current cryptojacking attacks target enterprises, with one strain making a massive impact in China over the past handful of months. Most cryptocurrency enthusiasts will be all too familiar with the term cryptojacking. This form of malware primarily focuses on making money by abusing the computer resources of its victims. In virtually all cases, the infected device\u2019s resources are used to mine cryptocurrencies, in the form of Monero, Dash, ZCash, or even Bitcoin. It has been a very bothersome trend for quite some time now, yet it seems the number of attacks will not necessarily diminish in the near future either. According to a new report by Symantec, the Beapy malware strain is one of the most problematic creatures to come to market in early 2019. It is a form of cryptojacking worm which is mainly interested in wreaking havoc upon Chinese enterprises. That in itself is a very interesting development, a sit seems criminals are less interested in attacking regular consumers or even small companies. Instead, they want to extract as much money as possible from the bigger enterprises. This also coincides with noteworthy increases where the average ransomware payment is concerned these days. What makes Beapy so difficult to deal with is how it makes use of the EternalBlue exploit. This is one of the security loopholes initially developed by the NSA and later on leaked to the public by The Shadow Brokers. As part of its process, Beapy also tries to obtain login credentials, which are spread through networks at an alarming rate. Since January of 2019, Beapy has gotten on Symantec\u2019s radar, and it seems to become a more common threat as more time progresses. Similar to some other cryptojacking malware strains, Beapy is distributed via email. As enterprises seem extremely vulnerable to such a method of distribution, it is only normal criminals will continue to target these victims accordingly. Although it doesn\u2019t appear is the attacks themselves are targeting specific companies, it is evident 98% of Beapy\u2019s activity focuses on the enterprise sector. This only further confirms consumers are not a prone target for cryptojacking criminals any longer, although that situation may come to change again in the near future. The current findings by Symantec paint a very interesting picture. More specifically, they see similarities between ransomware and crypto hacking attempts in the past 12 months. Both attack vectors slowly shifted toward attacking enterprises rather than regular consumers. For criminals looking to make a fair bit of money, going after corporations seems to be the more plausible course of action. This is not good news for enterprises, who often find themselves unable to deal with these attacks. Although Beapy appears to be prominent in China, it is not the only country on this malware\u2019s radar. Other regions being attacked include Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and even the United States. A wide selection of regions, although no one will deny over 80% of its presence focuses on China at this time. Depending on how lucrative these attacks prove to be over the coming weeks and months, there is a genuine chance the number of attacks in this country will increase even further.", "date": "2019-04-27T16:00:50+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 27}

Right now, no market is inclined to note any gains, although some do their best to contain the losses. When even the Cardano price losses over 10% in quick succession, the coming days will be rather rough. In the altcoin industry, the markets either move up with Bitcoin or perish with Bitcoin. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any middle ground in this regard, although things are not always black-and-white either. Right now, the color red seems to dominate all of the price charts first and foremost. Cardano is, just like all other top markets, losing a lot of value in quick succession. To put this in perspective, the past 24 hours have yielded another 10.7% decline in value. Although one ADA is still valued at $0.067202, one has to wonder how low the Cardano price will go in the hours and days to come. There is also a 5.84% loss in ADA/BTC, effectively forcing the 1,289 Satoshi level to come into play. What is rather interesting is how physical Cardano coins are seemingly coming to market recently. Anthony Tucci shared an image indicating as much, as the coins are seemingly minted in the month of April. A very interesting development, primarily because tangible coins are great collectibles first and foremost. Token Scorcher is looking at the current ADA price chart with somewhat mixed feelings. While the downtrend is very apparent for everyone to see, it also creates a new opportunity to pick up some cheap Cardano. Token Scorcher hoped to see the 1,300 Satoshi level hold, but that is not the case any longer. Catching a falling knife is always a risky endeavor. In fact, The Fly Investor expects this downtrend to continue, at least where ADA/BTC is concerned. It is not unlikely the predicted retrace to 1,200 Satoshi will occur in the coming hours and days, although the bigger question is whether or not that will be the effective floor for Cardano. This weekend will embody some crucial market momentum, that much seems certain. All of the Cardano momentum will primarily hinge on what happens to Bitcoin in the next 72 hours. As of right now, things are not looking too great, although things can always change on a dime. It is evident the cryptocurrency markets find themselves in a bit of an awkward position, although that is also what makes this industry so exciting.

This is primarily the result of Bitcoin dipping in the red, although that is never the only reason for this particular turn of events. The Basic Attention Token price is retracing pretty hard, as the $0.37 level could not be sustained at this time. It is not entirely uncommon to see this wave of bearish pressure materialize at this particular time. A lot of markets have noted very strong gains in recent weeks, yet it is evident such an uptrend will be met with a correction sooner or later. As Bitcoin is now struggling to push ahead even further, it is normal to see the altcoins struggle significantly as well. For Basic Attention Token, its most recent surge has come crashing down in quick succession. To put this in perspective, the Basic Attention Token price has lost 11.55% in its retrace to $0.368799. There is also an 8.73% decline in BAT/BTC, as its ratio now sits at 7m020 Satoshi. Furthermore, the 6.68% deficit in BAT/ETH further confirm the coming hours will remain rather rough, for obvious reasons. All things considered, this correction can be a good thing in terms of sustaining the long-term upward momentum. The big news of the week is how Brave browser users can finally start to earn BAT for viewing ads. While that is a significant breakthrough, it would appear this project also suffers from a key problem when it comes to the World Wide Web. Ads are only available in very specific regions right now, which further makes some users unhappy as to why they can\u2019t earn money as promised. This situation will be addressed eventually, but it is still somewhat disappointing. There are also some concerns as to whether or not the rewards being paid out in BAT is something that will be beneficial. As Yune_Tubi explains, getting paid in BTC would be far more favorable. As such, it seems likely a lot of BAT earners will effectively cash out their tokens for Bitcoin on a regular basis. That situation may come to change in the future, but when it is raised as a potential concern on day one, things might not necessarily look all that great. Luckily, there are also plenty of people who don\u2019t mind just earning BAT these days. Diogenes Valcantes is quite pleased with this utility token and how it is effectively rewarding users for browsing the internet as they would do normally. It will be interesting to see how all of these payouts will occur over time and whether or not users can make some good money with the Brave browser. No one will get rich overnight, though. While the current BAT price trend may prove to be somewhat troublesome, there is a genuine chance things will turn around fairly quickly. It will primarily depend on what happens to Bitcoin, as the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency dictates the pace for most of the alternative markets. As such, today and the upcoming weekend will be pretty interesting to keep an eye on, either for better or worse. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/5-crucial-aspects-of-indias-proposal-to-ban-cryptocurrencies/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "5 Crucial Aspects of India\u2019s Proposal to Ban Cryptocurrencies", "content": "Regulatory measures affecting blockchain and cryptocurrency projects often create a panic reaction among community members. In most cases, any regulatory measure will ultimately lead to either restricting or banning a specific type of activity. In India, a new proposal has been submitted to effectively prohibit cryptocurrency trading and use, although it has yet to be approved in the coming months. Below are a few key takeaways. Perhaps the most important aspect to highlight first and foremost is how the \u201cBanning of Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill 2019\u201d is not an official law in India at this time. In fact, it is a mere proposal which has been submitted by a dedicated panel tasked with drafting cryptocurrency regulation. As one would expect, they opt for the hasty approach to ban this type of activity, instead of fostering its growth over the coming years. While this proposal is now out in the open, it has yet to go through a round of public feedback. Afterward, the proposal will be amended if necessary, before it is proposed to the new government coming to power in India after the elections of May 2019. |That also means no official regulation will come into play before June of 2019 at the earliest. There is still a lot which can change between now and then, thus this proposal needs to be taken with a few grains of salt. Contrary to some other countries, this new regulatory proposal is not drafted by just one or two people. Instead, it already has the support of all major government agencies in the country today. That list includes the Central Board of Direct Taxes, Department of Economic Affairs, and so forth. Since all of these agencies will try to swing the \u201cvote\u201d in favor of banning cryptocurrency activity, now might be the best time to effectively prepare for this impending ban. Even if a new government takes power, these agencies will not change their opinion by any means. It would appear Indian officials are in favor of putting a blanket ban on all cryptocurrency activity. The proposal highlights the buying, selling, trading, and issuance of cryptocurrencies. That also means mining Bitcoin and altcoins will become a bannable offense, which may have some minor consequences for the industry as a whole. Even if the proposal is not approved in the end, the cryptocurrency panel will try to ban this activity under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Anyone who has paid close attention to the cryptocurrency industry in India will know there are numerous scams in that part of the world. It is only normal all of those scams combined warrant this rather stance against Bitcoin and altcoins. Especially the \u201cpromises of massive returns\u201d are a thorn in the eye of the cryptocurrency panel. While that usually doesn\u2019t pertain to legitimate currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, it seems the entire industry will face backlash in this regard. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect regarding this draft bill is how the cryptocurrency panel suggests \u201ctaking the time to implement these changes\u201d. That seems rather interesting, considering this proposal seeks to make an entire industry illegal. For those who want to defraud investors and speculators, however, that is not necessarily good news. These criminals can still be prosecuted under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act if necessary. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/the-cloud-mining-industry-meet-miningfriendly/", "author": "Guest", "title": "The Cloud-Mining Industry: Meet MiningFriendly", "content": "The crypto mining market has seen many ups and downs over the years. In bitcoin\u2019s early days, mining could be done profitably with nothing but a PC and special software installed on it. The rewards were high and could cover the costs of electricity consumed. With the increasing mining difficulty rate, the demands for computational power have increased immensely while the reward has been halved twice. Crypto-mining is so important because it brings new cryptocurrency coins into existence. The algorithm automatically regulates the rate of issuance of the new units while the total supply of bitcoins (and some other cryptocurrencies) is pre-determined upon its design. Today, cryptocurrency mining is done in several ways: with specialized hardware and software, individually or in pools, by using CPU, GPU, FPGA or ASIC. You can also mine crypto from a \u2018cloud\u2019. Hardware mining is very costly either on an individual basis or on an industrial scale. It requires enormous investments in graphic cards, immense amounts of energy and is only profitable if you live in an area where large amounts of electricity are available at a low price. The all-time leader in industrial-scale hardware mining is China. As of now, it has most of the profitability factors at its disposal and the largest concentration of mining farms compared to the rest of the world. The factors that determine profitability include cheap electricity, hardware equipment availability and the high market price for mined tokens. At the same time, it comes with a devastating impact on the environment. The by-product of running a mining farm is heat and CO2 emissions. Cloud mining represents a combination of several methods. From the user end, it is done online through a hosting service. The service provider offers you a mining contract that determines its length and profitability. This mining method has several significant advantages over all the others. This type of crypto mining allows sharing of processing power. It can be achieved from remote locations and with an average PC. As a result, that also implies no extra heat or emissions are produced. Remote mining offers lots of flexibility. So far, it is the only viable alternative to hardware mining. Among reputable cloud mining companies, it is worth noting MiningFriendly. The company operates from the most advantageous locations worldwide across several continents. It offers a choice of 5 subscription plans and 7 different mining capacity shares tailored for your budget and needs. What\u2019s more interesting, the ROI is known in advance and secures you from unwanted losses when the token\u2019s price drops. You can calculate your returns with the profitability simulator. MiningFriendly supports both crypto and fiat as payout methods and has 5 different reimbursement models. It is incredibly user-friendly and doesn\u2019t require any technical skills.

Most of the markets still deal with big losses, whereas the Binance Coin price is trying to make some sort of a comeback. How successful that venture will be in the long run, remains to be seen. Whereas most people expected the current bearish pressure to cause a lot of problems for most markets, there are always some exceptions to take note of. At this time, there is a genuine interest in Binance Coin, which is one of the few markets which tend to make people a lot of money at any given time. Even this week, it seems BNB is one of the more profitable markets, compared to Bitcoin and other alternative offerings. Over the past few hours, the Binance Coin price has successfully gained 3.75% on its rise to $23 and beyond. Although the market has seen a pretty big dip in the past few days, it would appear those losses can still be recovered without too many problems. There is also a 6.77% gain in BNB/BTC and a 7.45% gain in BNB/ETH. Very solid momentum across the board for Binance Coin today, although there is a lot of pressure on the hourly charts right now. On social media, it would appear things are getting a bit interesting where BNB is concerned. InspiringTy claims Binance Coin is \u201cwrecking\u201d the crypto industry as of right now, primarily because it tends to buck the overall price trend so many other markets are subjected to. While it remains to be seen if the \u201cgoodbye Bitcoin\u201d comment makes any real sense, there is a genuine belief Binance Coin will make other markets obsolete sooner or later. For those who look at the current BNB price chart, it is evident the uptrend is still in full effect once again. Although the dip has been noted a few days ago, the current rise from $21.4 to $23.42 is quite significant. There is some minor resistance along the way, but nothing that can\u2019t be overcome at this time. How long that momentum will remain in place, is always difficult to determine. Dean is trying a very different approach when it comes to spreading the word about Binance Coin. He contacted McDonalds in Australia to get them to accept cryptocurrency payments through the mobile application. As one would come to expect, this idea was met with a lack of optimism, as McDonalds isn\u2019t in the process of dealing with cryptocurrency payments right now. As such, it seems rather unlikely they will accept BNB all of a sudden. While it is good to see at least one top 15 market buck the overall bearish trend right now, it too may fall victim to the ongoing negative pressure. When that happens, there is no telling where the BNB price will end up at, as anything is possible in this volatile industry. Binance Coin has surprised many people so far, but it is evident all good things will come to an end sooner or later. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/5-reasons-why-atomic-swaps-trump-centralized-cryptocurrency-trading/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "5 Reasons Why Atomic Swaps Trump Centralized Cryptocurrency Trading", "content": "In the cryptocurrency industry, most of the trading occurs on exchanges. Or at least, that is what the overall statistics would indicate. Since coin-tracking sites do not keep tabs on OTC, P2P, or other types of non-centralized trading, there is a lot more to this industry than meets the eye at first. Add in the atomic swaps which continue to gain popularity, and things will only get more interesting in the near future. Now is a good time to look back at what makes these atomic swaps so promising. No one can deny the world of decentralized currencies, tokens, and assets is far too centralized when it comes to actual trading. Nearly every top exchange being used today is a centralized entity which controls users\u2019 funds, determines which currencies can be traded and when, and seems to dictate the industry in its own way. Notorious examples include Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Bithumb, GDAX, and so forth. All of these platforms offer convenient access to cryptocurrencies but at the price of not benefiting from financial freedom in any way. Atomic swaps, on the other hand, do things very differently. It removes the need for centralized exchanges, which are also prone to attacks, hacking, and mismanagement. With an atomic swap, there is no need for a third party, which will eventually lead to proper decentralized trading. Direct trades between different interested parties is something this industry can benefit from tremendously. Overthrowing the centralized strongholds will be a major challenge, albeit users will come around to embracing the benefits of decentralized options sooner or later. When a cryptocurrency investor or enthusiasts want to trade currency A for asset X, things often get complicated. Not every currency, token, or asset can be traded against every other token, asset, or currency on the market today. That may seem rather odd, but there are three major base trading pairs across most exchanges. The list includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Bar some minor exceptions, those are the main options for users to explore when dealing with any other currency, token, or asset today. Through atomic swaps, things will work very differently. Not only does this form of trading connect users directly without an intermediary, but it allows for a virtually infinite number of potential trading markets to be created on the fly. Any currency, token, or asset becomes interchangeable with any other offering on the market at that time. Everything can be done in one smooth motion, which is what users should actively seek in this day and age. When dealing with centralized trading platforms, there are always some fees to be paid. Whether it is on the deposit or withdrawal side, users will pay either way. Some exchanges even maintain maker and taker fees, while making the deposits and withdrawals free of charge. There is no such thing as a free lunch when using a third-party facilitator, especially in the cryptocurrency industry. That is only normal, as these companies need to make money in one way or another. Through atomic swaps, however, the need for a third party is no longer there. As such, the maker, taker, withdrawal, and deposit fees are also non-existent. Users will still pay on-chain transaction fees for sending money to other users, which is only normal. These traders take place across their individual networks or blockchains every time, and very few currencies can be transferred without paying a fee of some sort. However, there may be some interesting solutions to counter those fees in the future, for all one knows. Regardless of how people may look at centralized exchanges, they are not all powerful. Every single company facilitating cryptocurrency trading is subjected to system issues, wallet maintenance, regulatory concerns, and so forth. All of this requires users to put a lot of trust in the company they use, which is far from an ideal situation. If an exchange is found guilty of violating regulation, they can be shut down in specific regions or even altogether. This can create a fair few problems for users accordingly, either financially or otherwise. By removing the need for these centralized entities, all of these associated problems will be resolved as well. Atomic trades do not suffer from wallet maintenance, regulators targeting specific platforms, or having to trust anyone but oneself and the other user. Although this latter option may still cause a few problems and concerns, the main objective of an atomic swap is to enable trustless trading. Only time will tell how that will work out exactly., but it\u2019s certainly something that will need to be addressed before this new form of trading can take off. Perhaps the biggest problem the industry faces right now is how very few markets are interoperable in any way. Although systems exist to connect different blockchains and currencies, tokens, or assets, those are still few and far between. Interoperability in this industry is a must if mainstream growth is ever to be achieved. Otherwise, it will always remain a very limited niche industry. The current infrastructure also forces users to focus on the \u201ctop markets\u201d first and foremost, as those can provide access to the alternative markets. Diversification is crucial in this industry, yet it seems to be an overlooked facet more often than not. Many people hope atomic swaps will be capable of changing this narrative. By default, the option to freely exchange currencies, tokens, and asset swill boost overall diversification. Since users can trade different offerings directly without jumping through additional hope, a very different cryptocurrency ecosystem can be created. Additionally, the concept of an atomic swap will facilitate interoperability between different projects on a completely different scale. Combined with fee-less and trustless trading solutions, there is a lot to look forward to in the years to come. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

That is much easier said than done, as none of the top markets is able to contain the losses right now. The XRP price is going down a very slippery slope, as a drop below $0.3 seems very plausible all of a sudden. In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, tokens, and digital assets, there are always specific market trends which might not make too much sense. Even though Bitcoin is currently down by a few percent, the alternative markets easily lose 5% or more. Even XRP is facing tremendous pressure right now, which is not necessarily something people had expected. To be more specific, the XRP price has lost 6.86% as it now sits barely above $0.3. This is very different from the $0.325 level which was still in place until a few hours ago. Combined with the extra 4.52% loss in XRP/BTC, it quickly becomes evident things are not looking good. At this rate, XRP will easily drop below 5,000 Satoshi in the near future, which isn\u2019t necessarily a promising development. As the price woes continue to keep a lot of people engaged, the Twitterverse is looking at things from a different angle. Dsavino would love to see XRP supported by ErisX, although the company has not indicated such plans at this time. This unified platform for spot and CFTC-regulated futures products is worth keeping an eye on, even if it doesn\u2019t support Ripple\u2019s native asset. Krypto Kris has a somewhat disturbing observation when it comes to XRP community member\u2019 behavior. He sees more holders selling their holdings on Twitter and Telegram. While most people think that is worrisome, he actually sees it as a bullish sign. The current price trend would certainly disagree in that regard, although things can always turn around on a dime. There is another interesting observation brought to the masses by Mr. B XRP. He would like to remind people how RippleNet has been evolving as of late and how popular this technology has become in Japan lately. It is certainly a global expansion, although there is always more work to be done to improve upon the existing infrastructure. It will be interesting to see where XRP\u2019s price will end up at in a few hours from now. A dip below $0.3 is not dramatic by any means, although it will undoubtedly trigger some mild panic. The XRP/BTC ratio, on the other hand, continues to take potshots every single day, regardless of the overall industry trend. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/eos-price-heads-to-5-despite-hitting-1-million-account-milestone/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "EOS Price Heads to $5 Despite Hitting 1 Million Account Milestone", "content": "Even though Bitcoin still shows no signs of slowing down, the top alternative markets wouldn\u2019t mind to see things turn around ever so slightly. More specifically, all of the top altcoins are still in the red, with the EOS price drifting slightly lower every hour. Even though its current price point is still more than acceptable, one has to wonder how things will evolve over the next few hours and days. Even though it is far from uncommon to see altcoins lose value when Bitcoin goes on a tear, it remains to be seen if and when things will turn around for EOS and its \u201ccompetitors\u201d. As of right now, Bitcoin seems to be struggling slightly on the hourly chart, thus it is possible there may be some relief for the altcoins out there. For EOS, things are not looking too great right now, but it seems unlikely the price will drop below $4.5 anytime soon. Over the past day or so, the EOS price has dropped by 4.24% down to $5.13. There is also a 5.2% decline in EOS/BTC, which will undoubtedly put a lot of strain on the USD side of the spectrum as well. With one EOS now valued at 91,582 Satoshi, it would appear things will get pretty interesting in the days to come. Reclaiming the 0.001 BTC level would be a big step in the right direction for this particular altcoin. The big EOS-related news of the week so far is how this ecosystem has \u2013 finally \u2013 surpassed 1 million accounts. That in itself is a remarkable turn of events, although it may only be a sign of what is yet to come. There is a notable increase in accounts over the past few days, as 30,000 of these accounts were registered in the past 26 hours. Very interesting developments, which could easily warrant a price increase in the coming days and weeks. There is also an interesting proposal by EOS New York which would involve the burning of a significant amount of EOS tokens. The group proposes this course of action to burn all of the eosio.saving to eosio.forum. While token burns can often influence the price of said token, it seems rather unlikely this will be the case for EOS. Most of the Twitter community appears in favor of burning the coins, but the proposal has yet to be approved. Last but not least, it would appear some people are taking offense to Huobi Wallet officially supporting EOS and the airdrops taking place as part of that ecosystem. As EOS holders can claim their BG tokens as of right now, it seems Zack Williams is mad because Huobi Wallet never tried to support Steem in such a manner. Not all ecosystems will gain the same level of support of respect, which is only normal in this industry these days. When looking at all of the other markets, it seems EOS is not off worse compared to some of its competitors. However, with the recent account milestone being reached, one would expect things to improve in that particular department. There is more than enough trading volume to make interesting things happen, although it will mainly depend on what the future will hold for Bitcoin as well.

Most of the top markets have lost between 2% and 6% as a result, although there are always some notable exceptions. The Basic Attention Token price has shrugged off any bearish pressure, and is now skyrocketing once again. It is a remarkable turn of events, and one which makes many traders a lot of good money. For anyone who has looked at the BAT price chart in recent months, it quickly becomes apparent this currency sees ups and downs on a regular basis. With many ups and downs to be noted in terms of pricing and market cap, it is one of the more volatile markets to keep an eye on. The latest uptrend, however, has been in place for some time now and seems very hard to break. That could be interpreted as a very bullish sign for long-term speculators, although the market will remain unpredictable first and foremost. Over the past few hours, the Basic Attention Token price has gained 10.7% to rise back to $0.437646. There is also a 9.5% gain in BAT/BTC, and a 14% increase in BAT/ETH. All of these developments are very promising in their own regard, which further shows there is a lot of momentum behind this market at this time. Combined with over $109m worth of trading volume, there is plenty of potential market momentum looming around the corner. The current BAT price trend has many people on Twitter excited, which is far from surprising. Profits always seem to make a lot of people happy, as no one will deny the opportunity to make good money. Decentralized Bliss has high hopes for BAT and a few other coins, which might pop off in the very near future. As promising as Basic Attention Token might look right now, diversifying one\u2019s portfolio remains the most viable strategy first and foremost. A somewhat similar sentiment is shared by ShareableGuy. He is quite convinced things are still looking strong for Bitcoin and all of the top alternative markets in place right now. This list includes Basic Attention Token, among others, but it remains to be seen how things will play out exactly. Whereas some of the other coins on this list have lost USD and BTC value alike, BAT seems more than capable of bucking that trend. When looking at the actual price chart, it would appear there is a lot of interesting information to be looked at. Mihir Naik is quite pleased with the quick 5.5% profit he secured over a three-hour period, yet it remains to be seen how the market will evolve exactly. While BAT has broken out of the downward trench, there is still a chance a new resistance will be met in the very near future. Assuming that is the case, there is no telling where the price might end up at. All things considered, it is rather interesting to see the Basic Attention Token price note such major gains across the board. While there are other markets which could do the exact same, it seems BAT does so in a far more convincing manner. How long these gains will remain in place, is very difficult to predict at this time. A push to $0.45 seems plausible in the long run, but it might not act as a new support level right away.

While this altcoin still has a very loyal following first and foremost, there hasn\u2019t been much exciting Verge price action either. That situation may come to change following the current momentum, as an unexpected price change has taken place all of a sudden. It is always interesting to see how different cryptocurrencies respond to a bullish Bitcoin price run. Whereas most of the alternative markets have come under significant pressure all of a sudden, it would appear Verge is going in the opposite direction. A rather remarkable turn of events, primarily because it has been a while since anyone got excited about Verge\u2019s value. That may come to change once the price surpasses $0.01 again, assuming that will effectively happen. Over the past few hours, the Verge price has shot up like a rocket. Following a strong 7.54% gain in USD value, one XVG is now priced at $0.009136. There is also a 2.62% gain in XVG/BTC< which is perhaps the biggest surprise of them all. Most altcoins lose a lot of value in BTC terms, yet it seems Verge is more than capable of effectively doing the exact opposite. Very interesting developments worth keeping an eye on. The big news of the week is how Verge now has an official iOS wallet capable of supporting transactional privacy through the Tor network. This is widely considered to be a major development for this particular altcoin. It is unclear how much it influences the XVG price right now, but rest assured the hype may allow this momentum to carry over until the evening or even tomorrow. The push to $0.01 might become even more interesting in that regard, although there is no guarantee for success. Some traders even go as far as offering Verge-related advice pertaining to which levels to keep an eye on. CryptoWolfTeam expects the 160-165 Satoshi range to be great to buy XVG at this time. The current value sits in between these levels as of right now. Whether or not it will hit the sell area of 190 Satoshi or slightly higher, is a different matter altogether. Anything is possible in this volatile industry. For those who are looking for a quick buck without holding onto Verge for too long, there is a triangular arbitrage opportunity which can yield some big profits. Although it involves a few different currencies, it eventually comes down to flipping the obtained XVG on Bitbns to maximize one\u2019s profits. Options like these are always worth exploring in the cryptocurrency industry, even when the overall Bitcoin momentum is bullish. All things considered, it would appear Verge is making some sort of a minor and potentially temporary comeback all of a sudden. Whether or not there is any long-term momentum to keep an eye on, remains somewhat questionable right now. Even so, it is good to see at least one market move up when Bitcoin is bullish, as other markets tend to struggle significantly in this regard. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

In fact, there is always a chance some individual markets will note big losses when Bitcoin goes on a new run. As far as the Digitex Futures price is concerned, things are not necessarily looking all that great. The losses are piling up across the board, and there is little improvement in sight at this time. It is not entirely uncommon to see a handful of crypto markets note severe losses during an overly bullish trend for Bitcoin. As most altcoins tend to lose value in their internal ratio with Bitcoin, that can usually negate some USD-based gains as well. For Digitex Futures, the past few days have been anything but positive. Losses are still piling up all across the board and it seems that trend will not relent in the coming hours. Over the past 24 hours, the Digitex Futures price has dropped by another 8.95% down to $0.105122. As if that isn\u2019t enough, there is also a 13.53% loss in DGTX/BTC \u2013 down to 1,900 Satoshi \u2013 and a 12.07% loss in DGTX/ETH \u2013 down to 0.0006 ETH. None of these trends will instill a lot of confidence among holders and speculators, although there isn\u2019t too much one can do about this current negative trend. There is one major development which can help DGTX recover some lost value over the coming weeks and months. The Digitex Exchange software is still being tested behind the scenes as of right now. Although the exchange is expected to launch very soon, it is good to see some further ongoing testing to make sure everything works as expected. April 30th is the official launch date, although it remains to be seen if it can give the DGTX price a healthy nudge. There is also some debate as to whether or not Digitex Futures should migrate to the Binance Chain. It seems unlikely that will happen in the near future, although there is always a chance BNB will make its way to the Digitex Futures exchange in the coming weeks. While the latter option would make a lot more sense, it remains to be seen how things will play out accordingly. There is a lot of excitement when it comes to Digitex Futures exchange as of right now. Stephen Pickering can\u2019t wait to trade on this new platform, even though it remains to be seen if the experience can live up to people\u2019s expectations accordingly. This project is crucial for DGTX in many different ways, as the community can\u2019t handle any more disappointment in this regard. The coming weeks will get very interesting for many different reasons. When looking at the bigger picture, it seems DGTX will have a very rough road ahead, for obvious reasons. The losses are piling up quickly and might grow even worse as Bitcoin continues its bullish run in quick succession. Altcoins tend to suffer when that happens, and Digitex Futures looks incredibly vulnerable in this regard. The coming hours and days will be rather crucial for this market, albeit the outcome might not be overly positive. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

That is a very interesting development worth keeping an eye on in the near future. With Bitcoin popping off, it seems alternative markets follow suit pretty quickly. The Tron price still has some work to do first and foremost, but there isn\u2019t much to be concerned about in that regard. It is not uncommon to see alternative markets struggle when Bitcoin is noting some rather big gains. Although it is usually a temporary a matter of time until things return to normal, one has to keep in mind Bitcoin dictates the pace for everything else. Tron is under a fair bit of pressure when it comes to the current Bitcoin trend, primarily because the TRX/BTC pressure is still firmly in place. That in itself will worry a lot of traders and speculators, but it is also to be expected. To put this in perspective, the Tron price itself is up by 1.32%, which will keep a lot of people very happy. A value of $0.025281 is more than respectable in this regard. However, the worrisome development is how TRX/BTC continues to decline in value at an alarming rate. Ever since the 600 Satoshi level was breached, it didn\u2019t take long for this ratio to keep drifting lower. Today, it sits at 457 Satoshi, and may go even lower before the day is over. That in itself is a bit worrisome, although there may be some changes when people least expect it. Despite the price woes, there are plenty of developments happening within the Tron ecosystem. First of all, the Tron block height surpassed 8.6 million earlier today. Given the ongoing growth of Tron and how the dApps boost overall transaction numbers as well, things are getting very interesting in that regard. It is also a sign of overall ecosystem growth, which will be of great interest to long-term Tron investors and holders. A recent message by the Tron Foundation is also getting a bit of attention. More specifically, it would appear a recent Meetup involving the Tron USDT launch has been well received by the San Francisco crowd. No one will deny Tron has been doing a lot of things right in recent months, but there is still plenty of work to be done in the years to come. Organizing events like these are also of great value, as it keeps the community engaged at all times. Last but not least, there is the other Tron-related project known as BitTorrent Token. Albeit BTT has not performed all that well by any stretch of the imagination, the token is now listed on ChangeNow. It is a platform which supports registration-free swaps of dozens of different cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets, which can introduce some interesting trading volume changes for all supported markets. When looking at the bigger picture, it would appear there is not necessarily much to be concerned about as a Tron holder. While the TRX/BTC ratio continues to get battered first and foremost, the USD-based gains are still in place as of right now. If Tron can sustain itself above $0.025, there could be a very interesting week ahead. In terms of TRX/BTC, however, it would appear the drop to 450 Satoshi and possibly lower is all but inevitable right now. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

In most cases, the competitors will lose tremendous value in their BTC ratio, which pushes down the USD value as well. If the XRP price is any indicator, the top markets will start to slip pretty soon. It is evident there is plenty of pressure, but it can be overcome without too many problems. Over the past few months, it has become more than apparent XRP is not necessarily performing as expected. Although its USD value is not doing all that bad by any means, the XRP/BTC ratio is getting beat up fairly regularly. Even today, there are still further losses to keep an eye on, which is not making traders feel at ease. As a result, its USD-based value is also dipping in the red already. To put this in perspective, the XRP price has lost 0.09% in USD value to drop down to $0.325918. Nothing to be too bothered about, although a bit odd to see when seeing most of the alternative markets in the green. This deficit is created primarily because of XRP/BTC bleeding value once again. Another 4.57% loss has materialized in this regard, as XRP has dropped below 6,000 Satoshi for the first time in ages. Right now, the ratio sits at 5,865 Satoshi, and will potentially drop even lower as more time progresses. On social media, the opinions regarding XRP will always be somewhat divided. The Real Block X is keeping a close eye on the order books, as most of the buy orders are stacked in the low $0.30s range right now. That is pretty interesting to keep an eye on, assuming the value will ever drop to that particular level. Based on the current market conditions, it seems normal to expect another drop to materialize in the coming hours. Elcrypto, who openly advertises he is an XRP enthusiast, wonders why people are dumping XRP as of right now. It is a bit of a double-edged blade, as people are simply letting money flow back to the real top cryptocurrency, which is still Bitcoin at this time. If an actual dump is taking place, however, this may be only the beginning of what may yet be to come throughout the remainder of this week. Although XRP memes usually do not get too many people excited, the one shared by Crypto Joe XRP might put smiles on many faces regardless. This user is not bothered by Bitcoin pulling ahead, but he expects XRP\u2019s \u201cjets to fire up\u201d accordingly when the time is right. When all of this would happen exactly, is a different matter altogether, but there is some potential merit to this particular train of thought. All of this uneasy market momentum should not come as too big of a surprise for most people. Every time Bitcoin gains over 1% in value per day, there will be some casualties among alternative markets. While some people may worry XRP should not go down in value right now, the reality often works out very differently. There is a chance its USD value will continue to drop slightly lower in the coming hours, although one never knows how things will evolve. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

By integrating the Dutch-based blockchain platform LTO Network, they enable blockchain technology as an option for more than 1 million users worldwide, resulting in over 300,000 monthly transactions on LTO Network public chain. Over the last few years, the adoption of the digital signature has seen an immense rise in the corporate landscape. Whereas just years ago, scanners and couriers had a significant part in the concluding of a \u2018wet signature\u2019 agreement, the digital signature has become embedded widely in finance and legal departments. Industries that are traditionally slow on widely adopting new technologies, with digital signatures appearing to be the exception to this rule. This multi-billion dollar industry with a 31% per year compound annual growth rate shows the stretch that this technology still has to offer. With the future in mind, in which novel solutions allow digital signatures to become digital workflows that save money, increase efficiency and move businesses forward, these projected growth numbers even seem rather conservative. Micha\u00ebl Krens, CTO of SignRequest: Rick Schmitz, CEO of LTO Network: To really differentiate yourself from other players in the electronic signature landscape, you have to think outside the box. You can trust SignRequest systems, or any other signature provider, that the time of signing stated in the audit trail is the correct one, but with enabling blockchain technology our users now have the possibility to have hundreds of other systems verifying this as well and thus eliminating the need to trust a single party.

Weekends are usually nefarious for bearish pressure, whereas Mondays will confirm the trend or make other things happen. Today, it seems the latter option is in place. As the Cardano price shows signs of life again, traders show some degree of excitement where this altcoin is concerned. After a bit of a rough Sunday, it would appear as if the cryptocurrency markets are bouncing back rather strongly. This is in line with what most traders and enthusiasts had expected, although it is still good to see it come true. With Bitcoin leading the charge, there is a genuine chance the alternative markets will recover most of their recent losses in quick succession. Cardano is already on track to do just that, but there\u2019s still a ways to go. More specifically, the Cardano price has regained 4.6% in USD value as it rose back to $0.076211. There is also a strong bounce in ADA/BTC following a 3.48% improvement. With one ADA now valued at 1,435 Satoshi, everything seems to be back to normal, for the most part. The next objective is to improve upon the trading volume, as just $80m worth of trades isn\u2019t exactly convincing under these circumstances. On social media, there is plenty of Cardano-related activity to take note of. BTCJeanRalphio shares his latest trading strategy which seems to make a lot of good money in the long run. For Cardano, there were some wild swings recently, with a 57% gain one week and a 19% drop shortly after. Very interesting information for aspiring traders looking to make some good money. While trading advice should always be taken with a grain of salt, it is relevant information regardless. When it comes to the Cardano charts themselves, the current momentum seems to spark plenty of excitement. Although the recent retrace has triggered some concerns regarding the long-term trend, it seems this bounce is keeping most people rather happy. It all comes down to whether or not this trend will remain in place for very long, as that remains the more difficult question to answer. A slightly different opinion is shared by CardanoBuzz, although the opinion is still more than valid. This user claims the recent correction was entirely to be expected, primarily because of the recent bull run which preceded it. With the support still sitting tight at $0.072, it seems likely to assume this new uptrend may have some merit to it in the end. While there is a reason for cautious optimism, things can still change on a dime. All things considered, the current Cardano momentum seems to be legitimate. Although no major gains might materialize in the near future, the current uptrend is more than sufficient to keep things going for a little while. Once the trading volume picks up a bit, there may be even further momentum in either direction. As long as Bitcoin remains in the green, there won\u2019t be any real problems for any of the alternative markets. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Today is no different in that regard, as the current Factom price trend doesn\u2019t correlate with the top markets whatsoever. Traders will be pleased to see some gains materialize for FCT, as it has been a rough year so far. It is commendable to see some markets move up when the overall industry-wide sentiment is bearish first and foremost. In the case of Factom, it seemingly doesn\u2019t matter what is happening to Bitcoin as of right now. This market shows no intent to follow Bitcoin\u2019s pattern, as it effectively notes some gains whereas other markets fail to do so. To be more specific, the Factom price has effectively gained 4.51% to rise back to $9.34. Despite this somewhat appealing value, its total market cap still sits at just $88.22m, which is a lot lower compared to what people would come to expect. There is also a 5.5% gain in FCT/BTC, as this ratio has returned to 0.00177499 Bitcoin. Very interesting developments for a market which fails to note any real trading volume. On social media, there aren\u2019t too many discussions pertaining to Factom right now. Not entirely surprising, as the gains are neither impressive nor expected. It would appear this market struggles to keep traders engaged, although that can be said of many other alternative offerings as well these days. One of the discussions taking place comes in the form of how the FCT/BTC trading volume has effectively risen. Despite being well below one-fourth of a million Dollars, it is higher compared to the 30-day average. That is quite telling as to how few people seem to care about FCT as of right now. As the Binance DEX is getting a0 lot of attention, the team running the show is looking for ways to add more markets in quick succession. Gauging community feedback is an important first step in this regard. Krypto Kreme would like to see Factom listed, even though it seems unlikely that will happen. Without trading volume, there is no real reason for such a listing. All things considered, it seems unlikely the Factom uptrend can remain in place for more than a few more hours. This is primarily due to the lack of trading volume, but also because no one seems to really care where this market is headed. It is a bit of an odd offering this Sunday, although interesting things can always happen when people least expect it. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Although it seems the overall gains remain fairly limited, plenty of traders will be happy to see the XRP price improve upon its position. When it comes to the different cryptocurrencies, tokens, and asset son the market, there is hardly ever a unified trend. This is a good thing, as far too many markets will only note price changes depending on what happens to Bitcoin. Albeit some people will put XRP in that same boat, it is more than capable of forging its own path in this day and age. Over the past 24 hours, it would seem most of the XRP value woes have been negated successfully. Right now, the XRP price is up by 1.71%, as it successfully rose to $0,325916. There is also a 0.7% gain in XRP/BTC, which ensures this ratio remains above 6,000 Satoshi for at least another day. That in itself will offer some relief to most of the traders out there today. Postis Alpha shares some interesting views on what the future may hold for XRP. Rather than making some outlandish prediction, it would appear this user acknowledges there might note another all-time high in the near future. These markets are unpredictable first and foremost, thus anything is possible. Aussie Investor, who is a notorious XRP bull, keeps the faith alive where Ripple\u2019s native asset is concerned. He is quite pleased with how the market withstood the selling pressure for multiple months now and successfully bounced back every single time. This is a promising for the long run, albeit it may not result in steep gains either. Even so, a viable piece of information which often gets overlooked. Despite all of the hate XRP fans seem to get on Twitter these days, some users are more than proud to represent it. Fabio is now an official part of the XRP community and seems to be quite happy about it as well. Messages like these show everyone in this industry could get along rather well, if only they tried. When looking at the bigger picture, it would appear most of the top markets are going through a positive spell to kick off the new week. That is incredibly interesting to keep an eye on, albeit not indicative as to what may happen in the coming days.

Even the Tron price is going down significantly, with the hourly chart still looking very bearish at this time. Not too many people will be surprised to see Bitcoin dipping slightly in the red over the past few hours. This dip was coming for some time now, yet it has only materialized today. This is problematic for all of the alternative markets, as they primarily rely on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum first and foremost. Even Tron, which is often considered to be the next big thing, is under a ton of pressure right now. All things considered, it would appear the Tron price is incapable of moving up under these circumstances. With a 5.24% loss, one TRX is now valued at $0.024711. There is also another 4.32% in TRX/BTC, as that ratio has dropped to just 469 Satoshi. As long as that particular market remains under intense pressure, it seems plausible to assume the 450 Satoshi level will be reached fairly soon. It is only normal Tron traders are not too convinced where this market is headed next. As the market now sits below the 200 EMA, Lotus seemingly expects a bounce to materialize accordingly. In the real world, however, it would seem more likely the price will continue to tank unless Bitcoin goes through a sudden revival. There is a rather mysterious tweet by TronTokens Official which seems to make little sense. One has to wonder if this message has anything to do with the Tron project itself or any of the dApps built on top of its blockchain. Even so, Ponzi Schemes are a nuisance and should be eradicated sooner rather than later For those who are looking for a quick buck, exploring arbitrage opportunities is always a good option. Tron is subject to some interesting price gaps, although EXMO is not necessarily the most reliable exchange in terms of trading volume. For those who appreciate a quick 1% profit, the options below are worth checking out. When looking at the big picture, this may not be the best Sunday for the cryptocurrency markets given the current price trends.

Whereas some people expect big things from XRP, it would appear Ripple\u2019s native asset isn\u2019t making too much headway. In fact, the XRP price is going in the red as well, with a dip below 6,000 Satoshi looking all the more plausible. It is always interesting to see what the future holds for markets which are not Bitcoin. Since most of these markets rely on Bitcoin to gain any real value, it is only normal they lose value as soon as Bitcoin goes off a cliff. Although the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is not losing that much value, it appears things are a bit different where XRP and consorts are concerned. To put this in perspective, the XRP price has lost 3% to drop to $0.320269 once again. Ever since this asset broke the $0.33 level, there has been plenty of resistance on the market for some unknown reason. In terms of XRP/BTC, there is another 2.15% loss. People who have kept a close eye on this particular ratio will have noticed the decline from 9,000 to 6,000 Satoshi has been in place for some time now. So far, the ratio still sits at 6,087 Satoshi, but it is still under a fair bit of pressure. As one would come to expect, the XRP community remains strong despite how the market is evolving at this time. Zerp-Hunter isn\u2019t too bothered with the ongoing hate toward both Ripple and XRP, although he is more of a fan of the hold and accumulate game affecting different cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets. As such, it is always interesting to keep an eye on how individual community members look at their favorite asset. XRP NEO likes to post very cryptic messages on Twitter, which is only what one would come to expect from someone going by such a Twitter handle. He claims the Ripple and XRP rabbit hole keeps getting deeper and deeper. Whether or not that is a good thing, is a different matter altogether. It seems there are many prominent developments behind the scenes, albeit the price isn\u2019t responding in kind at this time. When looking at the actual XRP chart, it would appear there are many different possibilities which can play out over the coming hours and days. If this bearish pressure continues, there may be a drop to 4,500 Satoshi. However, there may also be a rebound fairly quickly, although one never knows what the future will hold. Although XRP is once again under a fair bit of pressure, it seems as if things could reverse course at any given moment. In terms of XRP/BTC, things might not necessarily improve, but there is a genuine chance the USD value will see some form of improvement in the very near future.

In Israel, it would appear as if a recent indictment is making a fair bit of attention. One citizen has been indicted for stealing nearly 1% of the entire Dash supply to date. A very interesting claim which warrants some explaining. Anonymous and privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies have attracted a lot of attention over the past few years. Even though Bitcoin remains the biggest cryptocurrency on the market, it is evident there is a growing focus on the likes of Dash, Monero, PIVX, and so forth. So much even that some people are tempted by options to steal such currencies from unsuspecting users by any means necessary. In Israel, things have reached a new level of escalation in that regard. A recent indictment filed against Afek Zarad paints a rather intriguing picture. More specifically, this user is charged with stealing 26 million Shekels worth of Dash, or roughly 1% of the current DASH supply available on the market today. This money is stolen from the culprit\u2019s roommate, who has been a cryptocurrency investor for many years now. It seems that individual has made some good money by doing so, as he primarily accumulated 74.990.74 Dash, worth nearly $9m at current prices. It is believed Zarad successfully transferred the funds to his own accounts through five different transactions. Additionally, the money was then moved on to different wallets to successfully erase any trace of their origin. It is unclear if a tumbler or mixing service was used, as the report seems to indicate all transfers have been linked together after some research. Unlike some other currencies, Dash transactions are not necessarily untraceable, despite making the job slightly harder. While the evidence is seemingly in place to back up all of the allegations, there are still some key hurdles which need to be addressed. One of the pressing questions is how they will try to prove the victim effectively owned the Dash balances in question. Moreover, there are still some questions as to how the money was stolen exactly and why the victim\u2019s accounts were not protected better than this. Furthermore, it will always be difficult to determine who effectively moved the coins and for what purpose. Stating how the accused has done so is one thing, but backing up the claims with solid evidence to remove any doubts is a different matter altogether. Additionally, proving the original owner had no hand in this transfer will pose its own set of challenges, for rather obvious reasons. Rest assured this particular case will get a lot of attention. Not just from a legal perspective, but the Dash community will also be keen to figure out what will happen to the funds in question. With nearly 1% of the circulating supply seemingly in limbo, anything can happen to the price over the coming weeks and months. If such amounts were to be liquidated, things could very dire in quick succession. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While not all markets follow similar patterns, the usual suspects seem to be moving up accordingly. A lot of people will keep an eye on the Basic Attention Token price, as it has gone on another major surge for some reason. As long as Bitcoin remains in the green, there is a good chance most alternative markets will go through very similar motions. Although the gains for most top markets are pretty small \u2013 if they exist at all \u2013 there are always interesting exceptions within the market cap top 50. Unsurprisingly, BAT is moving up fairly strongly again, especially now that some of the BNB hype has calmed down. More specifically, the Basic Attention Token price has gained over 15% in USD, BTC, and ETH value alike. Very impressive statistics, as weekends usually offer little to no bullish momentum for alternative markets these days. With a current value of $0.425, 7,983 Satoshi, or 0.00244 ETH, BAT remains a very solid performer under most circumstances. It is not entirely surprising to see this most recent BAT price surge lead to some consternation on social media. XBTLife sees this as some sort of joke even though the current gains are firmly locked in place and rather tangible. Whether or not they will remain in place, is a different matter altogether. Chase Simpson has seemingly been a long-term believer in Basic Attention Token. His purchase of BAT at $0.11 has paid off in spades so far, although it is possible this may only be a sign of things to come. As the Brave ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, the demand for this particular token may fluctuate accordingly. When looking closer at the actual price chart, it is only normal to see so many people expect a moonshot in the very near future. Although BAT is still just halfway to setting a new all-time high, this most recent uptrend has been rather remarkable for many different reasons. Christina Todaro certainly expects bigger and better things to come now that the recent losses have been recovered. It is good to see some of the cryptocurrency markets note strong gains during a weekend It is a rather rare sight, although it is never impossible to see major bullish market momentum.

Most of the markets are either in the green or not tiny losses which is not all that worrisome. The Tron price is also heading south, primarily because the hourly charts continue to add minute bearish pressure to the overall trend. It is only normal some crypto market swill suffer from a retrace of sorts during the weekend. As Saturdays and Sundays are usually very bearish for top markets, the overall trend today comes as somewhat of a surprise. However, markets such as Tron do not always get to benefit from a stable Bitcoin price during these times. Today is no exception in that regard, as minor losses can be noted across the board. To put this in a different spotlight, it would appear the Tron price is suffering from a 1.26% loss as it dropped to $0.026101. What is slightly more worrisome is how TRX/BTC continues to head south as well. A fresh 2.05% loss drives this ratio down to 490 Satoshi. It is evident the 500 Satoshi level remains under a fair bit of pressure these days, and may continue to go lower in the near future. On social media, there are some questions as to which currencies, tokens, and assets will make their way to Binance DEX in the coming months. Sonny Red wouldn\u2019t mind seeing TRX and BTT get listed on this platform in the near future. While TRX would seem like a solid bet, the listing of BTT is a different matter altogether. Speaking of exchanges and Tron trading, it would appear BW \u2013 the Asian platform -has finally decided to get on board with Tron. Why it has taken the company this long, is difficult to answer right now. Even so, traders can exchange TRX for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT. Very interesting pairs which can only help improve Tron\u2019s overall trading volume and liquidity. As one would come to expect in 2019, there are still people who genuinely want to see some markets burn to the ground. Colector72 Crypto makes an interesting comment in this regard, as he hopes to see TRX drop down to $0.0183. In fact, he hopes others will help push the price down to this level, which is not necessarily the kind of attitude this industry needs right now. All things considered, Tron\u2019s current losses are anything but insurmountable. Even though things might not look all that promising right now, these losses can be recouped with little to no effort.

All of these offerings tend to offer something slightly different from its competitors, to varying degrees of success. ZenGo is a very different creature, as it is a wallet solution which doesn\u2019t require key pairs whatsoever. As is to be expected, this controversial approach tends to leave the community a bit divided. While one has to commend cryptocurrency wallet developers on trying a different approach compared to the current offerings, one has to wonder how many of these options will prove to be viable in the long run. ZenGo, a project developed by KZen, is very different compared to what most people are used to by now. Unlike most, if not all of the other offerings, this wallet does not require key pairs to prove ownership of currencies or enable transactions. More specifically, the KZen blog post confirms their project makes use of open source threshold cryptography. This is, in the team\u2019s opinion, a viable way of replacing private keys and all of the hassle associated with this particular information. A lot of cryptocurrency users struggle to keep their private key safe from harm. Moreover, not everyone understands how that vital piece of information should never be shared with anyone else, thus it is considered to be a potential point of failure. The ZenGo cryptocurrency wallet still benefits from the key features one would expect from such solutions. Users can backup the wallet if needed, recover it if something goes awry, and the funds will only be controlled by the end user. While it sounds too good to be true, the team is confident they have successfully pulled it off. Although their product is currently still in private beta for mobile devices, it seems the concept has tremendous potential for the future. The big question is whether or not this software solution can succeed where others struggle or have failed. More specifically, cryptocurrency wallets are not for the masses, regardless of how simple they may have become to use in recent years. Getting people interested in Bitcoin and altcoins will remain the first order of business, and it appears ZenGo will not necessarily address that particular problem right away. Once the application becomes available to more people, it will be interesting to see how the user base responds. It is likely this solution will be appreciated by veterans and those who are already involved in cryptocurrency. However, for the average person on the street, it will be of little to no interest. Without any cryptocurrency to be stored, it seems unlikely too many people will experiment with ZenGo. While the business model is more than interesting, it will not sway the public\u2019s opinion on Bitcoin and altcoins. In the end, this is another sign of how dealing with cryptocurrencies can be made a lot simpler and more straightforward. While it is an interesting idea, the key hurdle in this industry is to get more people interested in this new form of money in the first place. How the KZen team will tackle that particular aspect, remains unclear at this time. Rest assured this keyless crypto wallet solution will get plenty of attention, either for better or worse.

While this is not entirely surprising, it would appear the Litecoin price is facing a lot of negative pressure as of right now. Its price may very well drop below $75 in quick succession, but it seems unlikely any further decline will materialize. In the cryptocurrency world, weekends are usually interesting in many different ways. More specifically, it would appear most of the bullish momentum materializing earlier this week is slowly being eroded where the alternative markets are considered. Litecoin has come under a ton of pressure over the past few hours, although it is not in proportion to how Bitcoin\u2019s price is evolving. To be more specific, the Litecoin price has dropped by 6.84% to $75.74. There is also a 6% decline in LTC/BTC, which further confirms things can get a lot direr over the coming hours. With one LTC now valued at 0.01439 Bitcoin, a fair few traders will be unhappy and concerned as to what is happening all of a sudden. It is rather odd for a market with $2.658bn in trading volume to see such major declines in quick succession, but there is little to be done about it. On social media, there is no real concern among the Litecoin community at this time. More specifically, Philip Kennedy keeps people informed of how much LTC is mined every single day. It would also appear one of the bigger Litecoin \u201cwhales\u201d has accumulated a fair portion of those mined coins. That in itself is very interesting for many different reasons, albeit it may not necessarily reflect on the LTC price in any prominent manner. Earn With Rk, on the other hand, sees this particular development as a sign of how the Litecoin uptrend is still in place. While that is a commendable attitude toward the current market decline, expecting a $116 price target seems rather unlikely. Although anything is possible in this volatile industry, one has to wonder when this 50% value increase should materialize exactly. For those who keep a closer eye on the Litecoin chart, it would appear things are getting very interesting moving forward. Although the LTC/USD ratio has all but collapsed at this point, one has to keep in mind this may very well be just a temporary setback. Even so, recovering this 6% loss may prove rather challenging, as it will probably take several days to make it happen. All things considered, all alternative markets stand or fall based on Bitcoin\u2019s overall momentum. Even though Bitcoin notes a very minor loss right now, the alternative markets are getting battered beyond belief. For the time being, it seems rather unlikely Litecoin will recover these losses in quick succession, but one never knows what the next week may bring.

As the weekend is a notoriously bearish period, one would come to expect some altcoins to lose value regardless of where Bitcoin is headed. Today is no different, as the VeChain price is under pressure and might drop below $0.007 again. Although it seems to have gone relatively quiet where VeChain is concerned, the project is still faring quite well. In fact, there have been several major milestones for this project over the past 18 months, all of which could have influenced the price in a positive manner. Surprisingly, it seems this market continues to note bearish and sideways momentum despite everything that takes place behind the scenes. Over the past 24 hours, the VeChain price has lost another 2.3% in USD value and 2.85% over Bitcoin. Because of these ongoing changes, one VET is now valued at $0.007012, or 132 Satoshi. Neither level will please traders and speculators, yet it seems unlikely any major changes will occur over the next few hours. The bigger development involving VeChain this week comes in the form of a grant pool. Sunny Lu confirmed this $500m pool will incentivize developers and businesses to focus on VeChainThor development. Building new applications, solutions, and platforms is always a top priority, thus this announcement can genuinely shake up the market. Daniele is genuinely convinced the current Vechain value is far below the price it should be at. While that is an argument like any other, it would appear the market makers disagree with that statement at this time. Adoption of a blockchain ecosystem doesn\u2019t necessarily trigger a token price rise by any means. When looking at the actual price chart, it becomes apparent there is a lot of pressure on the current support level. Assuming this level will not hold, there may be an even bigger price retrace ahead over the coming hours and days. How low the VET price can go, is up for debate, but the current outlook isn\u2019t all that great. When looking at the bigger picture, it quickly becomes apparent anything can happen where VeChain is concerned. Only time will tell if that is for better or worse, as the current trend may not be indicative of what is yet to come. At least, that is what most holders and traders hope for, at this point.

Some projects will face declines well before their competitors. It seems the Stellar price is still maintaining its uptrend, despite some minor pressure on the hourly chart. In this volatile world of cryptocurrencies, tokens, and digital assets, any sort of market momentum can materialize when people least expect it. Right now, the bearish sentiment seems to grow stronger by the hour, whereas most traders expected a bullish outbreak. For the time being, Stellar is capable of holding on to its small gains, but that may not remain the case much longer. To be more specific, the current Stellar price is still up by 1.54% as it rose to $0.112876. There is also a 0.75% gain in XLM/BTC, as the ratio now sits comfortably at 2,127. How long either of these levels will remain in place, is difficult to predict. Once Bitcoin starts to slip, it will go downhill pretty quickly for alternative markets. What is rather interesting is how all crypto markets seem to maintain their normal trading volume without missing a beat. For Stellar, that is roughly equal to 11% of its market cap, which is more than acceptable under any circumstance. However, if the bearish pressure becomes tangible, this volume may trigger a fair bit of selling off in very quick succession. An interesting few hours lie ahead for this particular market. On social media, there are some interesting developments worth keeping an eye on. Running a Stellar validator is not overly complicated. Wirex, the payments and payment card provider, currently runs three different validators. They all appeared on the network over the past few weeks, which further seems to confirm the company has high expectations of Stellar. In a completely different discussion, there is still a lot of excitement regarding the partnership between IBM and Stellar. Since IBM\u2019s blockchain division is using XLM for settlement and built their solution on Stellar\u2019s infrastructure, the possibilities seem virtually limitless. How that will affect the XLM value over the coming months and years, remains somewhat difficult to predict. All things considered, Stellar\u2019s price will probably not remain in the green for much longer. That same logic applies to all other markets, thus it is not an isolated incident by any means. For now, the market trend doesn\u2019t seem to warrant any steep declines either, thus it is likely no real damage will be done in the process. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

So far, it has proven to be one of them ore profitable investments of 2019, and even more so for those who bought it when BNB was valued at mere cents. In its latest uptrend, the Binance Coin price is getting a lot of attention again, as it seems on par to hit $23 this weekend. When Bitcoin is moving up ever so slightly, there are plenty of alternative markets which will perform admirably as well. As far as Binance Coin is concerned, it seemingly couldn\u2019t care less which way Bitcoin is headed these days, as it mainly resumes a bullish trend without too many problems. The most recent setback has been overcome as well, as the BNB value continues to skyrocket without any real resistance. To put everything in its proper perspective, the Binance Coin price gained another 8.81% to rise to $22.68. There is also an 8.42% gain in BNB/BTC, and a 7.58% increase in BNB/ETH. All of these trends are very impressive in their own regard, although it remains to be seen how high the price can go in the near future. Many people expect a new all-time high, which would require another 9-10% increase in value. Not unlikely given the bullish sentiment. On social media, there are plenty of people who are smitten by Binance Coin, for rather obvious reasons. Jamie is impressed with the way BNB is potentially the first top market to note a new all-time high. It is pretty interesting to see any market note a new high after the bearish year 2018 has proven to be. Even so, if Binance Coin can note such strong gains, there is no reason to think the other top markets won\u2019t be able to do the same. Speaking of reaching a new high, it would appear Petr Misan expects some sort of uptrend to materialize in the near future. Considering how it would \u201cjust\u201d require a $2 price increase per BNB, it is far from unlikely to see something along these lines occur. The bigger question is whether or not that value can be reached, and if so, how long it will take for a massive BNB correction to kick in. As is always the case on Twitter, there are also those who oppose the current Binance Coin hype. Robb Stark \u2013 not the real one \u2013 considers BNB to be a \u201cscam coin\u201d because the exchange has not been \u201cpublicly audited\u2019 for quite some time now. It is evident this rise in BNB value raises a lot of questions, but spewing such allegations without any proof to back it up seems to be the wrong way to go about it. When the dust settles, the true test for BNB still lies ahead. These current gains are a continuation of what has been happening for quite some time now, yet one also has to wonder how sustainable the trend itself really is. Going from $4.79 to $22.68 between December 2019 and April of 2019 is very impressive, but it seems unsustainable. Even so, Binance Coin shows no real signs of weakness at this point, thus anything remains possible. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/ontology-price-dips-slightly-but-should-recover-fairly-soon/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Ontology Price Dips Slightly but Should Recover Fairly Soon", "content": "Another day dawns upon the cryptocurrency industry and it appears a minor amount of bearish pressure is making its presence felt. While not all markets are suffering from this momentum, it would appear the Ontology price is starting to struggle for any real momentum. Overcoming this minor setback will not pose too much of a challenge, but one never knows what the future holds. It is not necessarily worrisome to see over half of the top 20 crypto markets in the red right now. As none of the losses are too steep, it would appear interesting momentum might be brewing ahead of the weekend. Ontology, while also suffering from a minor setback, is seemingly on the road to recovery once again. Its value seems to hold its own above $1.3 without any real resistance, which is pretty interesting to keep an eye on. Over the past 24 hours, the net tally for Ontology shows a 2.79% decline in USD value to $1.32 and a 2.33% loss over Bitcoin. None of these setbacks is disconcerting, although it may have spooked some traders and enthusiasts. The overall trading volume of $72.84m is still going strong, however, which may indicate this downtrend is only temporary. It will primarily depend on where Bitcoin\u2019s value is headed next, as that will dictate the pace for all other markets as well. The big news of the day is how Ontology has been added to the Voyager investment platform. Users can buy and trade ONT with US Dollars through the iOS app without paying any commission. It can help improve the altcoin\u2019s overall liquidity, albeit the actual impact of this offering remains a bit unclear. It seems this functionality was available since February, yet the company only now paid \u201cofficial\u201d attention to it on Twitter, for some reason. A lot of people pay significant attention to price alerts, either through websites or Twitter accounts. Invalert has confirmed they are now tracking Ontology, alongside BAT, BNB, and IOST as well. This is pretty interesting for traders and speculators alike, although coin alerts are never a guarantee for making money in the volatile cryptocurrency industry. For those who want some ONT chart action, it would appear the coming hours can be very crucial. Crypto-GAINZ expects a new uptrend to materialize in the next hour or three, assuming the $1.3 level holds as support for a while longer. For now, it appears that will be the case, but there is also a genuine chance some further bearish pressure could materialize. With the weekend just around the corner, any and all options need to be kept on the table at all times. While Ontology might not be indicative for other cryptocurrency markets, it would appear this particular altcoin should bounce back fairly soon. If other altcoins recoup their losses as well, the uptrend should be resumed once the weekend comes around. There are never guarantees in this industry, but it would appear the ONT value should go in the green again fairly quickly. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While weekends are not usually known for their bullish momentum, today has proven to be a more than interesting exception in this regard. The Binance Coin price is moving up swiftly, as yesterday\u2019s trend is still in place today. This also marks the first new all-time high for BNB in over a year. It is always interesting to see how the individual cryptocurrency markets evolve throughout the weekend. As long as Bitcoin remains as bullish as it is right now, there is nothing to worry about where alternative markets are concerned. Binance Coin is the biggest \u201cbeneficiary\u201d of this bullish surge, as it is the first top 10 coin to note a new all-time high in 2019. To put this in perspective, the Binance Coin price noted another 10.64% gain in both USD and ETH value alike. There is also a 9.78% rise in BNB/BTC, which puts an even more interesting spin on this particular market as of right now. With a current price of $24.72, or 0.1424 ETH, or 0.00466 Bitcoin, things are looking pretty good. One has to wonder how long this train can keep going, as BNB has been bullish for several months already without facing much of a setback. On social media, the perceived \u201cshilling\u201d of Binance Coin is still ongoing. Any market which rises in value will see this type of behavior from community members, which is only to be expected. S1lverbox wants to remind people now is still a good time to buy BNB as its current value might not necessarily be an indicator as to what will happen in the coming months. In fact, there is always a chance BNB will come tumbling down in the future, as unlikely as that might seem right now. Weiss Ratings is also keeping a close eye on what is happening with the cryptocurrency markets these days. The company has seemingly high hopes for Binance\u2019s blockchain and decentralized exchange solution. Only time will tell if these releases can impact the price in any significant manner, but it is evident a lot of things are coming together for Binance and its native asset at this time. Those who prefer to look at a BNB price chart, it would appear the coming hours may be rather crucial. Although the uptrend remains intact right now, one has to wonder if there will be a pullback of some sort in the coming few days. This massive uptrend without much resistance has made a lot of traders good money, but they will be taking profits fairly soon at this rate. Whether or not that will effectively disrupt the price trend, is very difficult to predict. While most people expect Binance Coin to hit $25 and even $30 in rather quick succession, nothing is ever set in stone in the cryptocurrency industry. This market is incredibly bullish, and even more so than other top markets. This could be a sign of BNB decoupling itself from Bitcoin in a meaningful manner, although it may also be an uptrend which will result in a 60% correction over the coming weeks. One never knows where these markets will head next, for rather obvious reasons. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Contrary to what people expected, the Ravencoin price is noting some pretty big losses across the board. Holding on to the $0.057 level might not be as straightforward as initially assumed. It is more than obvious most of the cryptocurrency markets follow Bitcoin\u2019s price trend at all times. Some of the adverse markets can be worth keeping an eye on as well, but only if the trend works in their favor. For Ravencoin, that is not the case right now, as it is one of the few top 50 markets noting any net losses. In fact, the losses may continue to pile up over the coming hours. To be more specific, the Ravencoin price dropped by 4.4% down to $0,057624. To make matters worse, there is also a 5.4% decline in RVN/BTC, as that ratio now sits at just 1,090 Satoshi. It is not impossible this ratio will continue to dip further and eventually test the 1,000 Satoshi level to find new support. When it comes to the current Ravencoin momentum, the emotions are running wild on social media right now. Stanley would like this altcoin to \u201cstop fucking with his emotions\u201d. Getting emotional when trading cryptocurrencies is one of the key mistakes many people make. This is a cold hearted business, in good days and bad ones. CryptoNail shares an interesting price chart for Ravencoin which might put some people\u2019s concerns at ease. Although the altcoin is in a triangle pattern, for the time being, there isn\u2019t much to prevent a breakout in either direction. It is more likely the market will continue to fall, but an uptrend can always occur when people least expect it. Snr_cr offers a bit of a different chart which seems to confirm the downtrend will remain in full effect for quite some time now. That is not necessarily what traders want to see, but the chart clearly depicts a descending channel which might prove very difficult to break out of. Especially with the weekend around the corner, things can easily go from bad to worse. All things considered, it is somewhat unfortunate to see Ravencoin fall victim to a downtrend while all other markets are seemingly thriving. That doesn\u2019t mean all markets will turn bearish again overnight, but some altcoins will suffer from more pressure compared to others. As far as RVN is concerned, the coming days will be pretty interesting, regardless of where the market will head next. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While the current trend might not necessarily please every trader, speculator, and enthusiast, it is the hand people are dealt regardless. The Cardano price, while expected to turn very bullish, has seemingly gone the other way in quick succession. It seems a bit odd to see the market head south, although it remains to be seen how long that situation remains in place. In the cryptocurrency world, there are many different market trends to keep an eye on at all times. When Bitcoin dips ever so slightly in the red, some altcoins will follow in very quick succession. Cardano is one of the few markets which has successfully bucked the Bitcoin trend for some time now, yet it appears today will not necessarily be too successful in that regard. Even so, its current deficits are not problematic to overcome either. To put this in perspective, the Cardano price has lost 4.7% to drop below $0.8 for the first time in quite some time. Although the $0.079476 value is not necessarily a bad outlook either, it appears a fair few enthusiasts had expected a rise to $0.1 in quick succession. So far, that momentum has not materialized as of yet, although things can easily turn around over the course of the weekend. There is also a 4.19% decline in ADA/BTC, which will put more strain on this market. On social media, there appears to be some genuine excitement regarding the recently released Cardano roadmap. It is pertinent for any cryptocurrency project to keep its community engaged and updated at all times. For Cardano, the foundation for Shelley has been well received, thus it seems likely to assume some market momentum will materialize in the coming months if these roadmap milestones get checked off. It would also appear one of the female Japanese Cardano enthusiasts has gotten a lot of attention in the past few weeks. Although this will not impact the ADA price in any way, it is always interesting to see more community members get a bit of a spotlight. For Cardano, it is also an interesting way to gain a bit more attention moving forward, which is always a promising sign. Last but not least, there is a new Cardano-themed video by The Crypto Lark which hints at upcoming changes and developments affecting Cardano. With staking support coming in the near future and a stronger focus on the enterprise vision materializing, there is some reason to be cautiously optimistic. How all of this will affect the project as a whole in the near future, remains to be determined. Even though the current ADA price momentum might not necessarily look all that great, there is always a chance things will turn around when people least expect it. If Bitcoin can get in the green again, it seems all the more likely Cardano and other alternative markets will follow suit pretty quickly. With the weekend just around the corner, there is a lot of potential market momentum to look forward to, either for better or worse. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

The Ethereum price makes for an interesting example in this regard, as it is still going strong without any real setbacks. Sustaining a value of over $170 will be difficult, but one never knows what the coming hours may bring. In the world of cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets, it would appear there is a lot of interesting momentum to contend with as of right now. While Bitcoin notes very small gains first and foremost, it seems Ethereum is still going rather strong. Its gains are not spectacular per se, but it is interesting to see similar uptrends where both its USD and BTC value are concerned. A lot of altcoins note small losses in BTC value, but Ethereum is one interesting exception. When looking at the Ethereum price trend, the current 2.72% has allowed the value to rise above $170 again. In fact, it even surpassed $171 without too much resistance, but there is always a chance some reversal will kick in. Combined with a 2.42% increase in ETH/BTC, it seems everything is going according to plan. There is also over $6.3bn worth of trading volume to take into account, which can allow this uptrend to remain in place for a little while longer. On social media, a lot of people are sharing their views on the Ethereum chart, which is not entirely as surprising. Moarbtc seems to expect a \u201cblowout\u201d for ETH/USD on Bitfinex in the coming hours and days, although the proposed price target might be a bit too optimistic first and foremost. Sustaining the current level will already be difficult enough as is, especially with the weekend looming just around the corner. Wally530 seems to offer a somewhat similar view, although it is not necessarily as optimistic by any means. While there is a chance for an uptrend and subsequent dip prior to higher values being reached, it seems no fallback is expected for the foreseeable future. Considering how the current gains are rather small, it would not necessarily warrant too much of an uptrend under the current circumstances. Last but not least, there is the view shared by SignalFI. The \u201cGolden Pitchforks\u201d scenario, while rather unusual, is still in play according to this particular trader. Since there is no real bearish pressure to speak of, there is a genuine chance the uptrend will be resumed in a slow and steady manner. How high the price will go in the process, is difficult to predict. All things considered, it would appear there is a lot of positive momentum where Ethereum\u2019s current price trend is concerned. While that momentum may not turn into spectacular gains and losses over the coming hours and days, it is all traders can ask for at any given time. A price push to $200 seems rather unlikely at this time, but reaching $175 is not necessarily out of the question by any means. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Albeit Ripple\u2019s XRP is not a cryptocurrency by definition, it is traded on crypto exchanges and against other cryptocurrencies. It also allows traders to make some good money if the value shifts in a positive manner. Right now, the XRP price seems to be somewhat bullish, as there are strong gains in both USD and BTC value alike. The past few weeks have been a mixed bag for Ripple\u2019s XRP asset. At least in the price department, there have been ups and downs across the board, which ultimately nearly negate done another. As such, it seemed as if there would be no exciting price action for some time to come. Today has already shown there is still plenty of momentum in the tank, as a healthy uptrend has begun to materialize. How long it will remain in place, is a different matter altogether. To put this development in perspective, the XRP price has gained 4.72% to rise back to $0.3395. It seems a push to $0.34 and potentially higher should materialize in the coming hours, although nothing is ever certain in this volatile industry. There is also a 3.61% gain in XRP/BTC, which brings the ratio back to 6,443 Satoshi. There is still a very long way to go until this level reaches 9,000 Satoshi or more again, but it seems some losses have been recuperated in the process. When browsing social media, it seems there is a lot of excitement among the XRP community. A lot of people are keeping a close eye on the Fiat Leak website, as it shows how different cryptocurrencies and assets are being purchased in real-time. The site seemingly indicates the XRP action is picking up significantly, as roughly 25 million XRP is traded every hour. That might not seem like much, but it would explain why XRP\u2019s overall trading volume is on the rise in the past few hours. A lot of people are keeping a close eye on the current price chart, which shouldn\u2019t come as too big of a surprise. Darren CoinRivet hopes to see some interesting momentum materialize in this regard, although there is a chance some resistance will come into play fairly quickly. After all, no market is allowed to move up without much resistance these days and it seems unlikely XRP will be an exception. For some unknown reason, there is still the XRP meme which depicts a potential price push to $589. While it is virtually impossible to ever reach that price, it seems this particular meme is making the rounds once again. Vanessa B is the one responsible for making it pop up again, even though no one really believes XRP will ever hit a double-digit USD value, let alone nearly $600. When looking at the bigger picture, it seems there is a lot of momentum brewing behind the scenes of all the top markets. As long as Bitcoin remains in the green, most of this momentum should remain in place for some time to come. As far as XRP is concerned, turning $0.34 into a new support level is certainly possible, although one never knows how the winds will change in the near future.

While no real sense of weakness is detected as of right now, it would appear interesting shifts are happening nonetheless. The Binance Coin price has successfully surpassed the $20 mark, which will please a lot of traders accordingly. Plenty of cryptocurrency traders have high hopes for Binance Coin. This native token of the Binance trading platform has made quite the impact in recent months. However, its price trend has not necessarily followed the path people were hoping for, as there have been some interesting setbacks along the way. Today, most of that negative momentum belongs to the past, as it appears BNB is pushing through resistance levels pretty quickly. To be more specific, it has been a while since the Binance Coin price hit or surpassed $20. It seems this hurdle has been overcome in the end, although it has taken a significant amount of time to do so. Many people now believe BNB will surpass its all-time high of nearly $24.5 pretty soon, although that might be a bit optimistic. The current 4.86% gain to bring the value to $20.66 is pretty spectacular, and will undoubtedly trigger some market resistance as well. The most recent price spurt has triggered a slew of expectations from BNB holders and speculators, as was to be expected. Homeless Bitcoiner hopes for a price of $100 or more, although that might not necessarily occur in the near future by any means. While it is evident the BNB/USD market is on fire, it will fall apart if Bitcoin decides to go through another bearish stint. This coming weekend may prove rather interesting in that regard. ScotsmanTrades is keeping a very close eye on how the charts are evolving right now. It seems there is an interesting correlation between the Bitcoin and Binance Coin charts right now, although it is difficult to determine where things will head next. If Bitcoin goes through a similar bullish breakout, a push to $10,000 could materialize a lot sooner than people expect. For now, this correlation needs to be taken with a few scoops of salt, as BNB can break out a lot easier than Bitcoin ever will. While it doesn\u2019t happen all that often Binance Coin gets its own memes on Twitter, it would appear things are a bit different today. Nikita Poymatov has shared a very nice meme to celebrate Binance Coin hitting $20 in such a decisive manner. Although it remains to be seen how long that value can remain in place, the current momentum seems very promising first and foremost. With all of this impressive momentum in place, one would expect Binance Coin to remain rather bullish for quite some time to come. However, these current gains may also trigger a lot of sell orders from traders simply taking profit and waiting for a drop to $18 or lower to buy back in. It is impossible to predict where this market will be headed next, as it can easily swing in either direction without much of an advance warning. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/enjin-coin-price-uptrend-keeps-going-following-strong-gains/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Enjin Coin Price Uptrend Keeps Going Following Strong Gains", "content": "In the world of altcoins, there is never a lack of market momentum whatsoever. While not all markets are effectively moving in the same direction, it would appear some offerings make much of a bigger impact compared to others. The Enjin Coin price is an interesting example in this regard, as it continues to impress traders all over the world. A lot of traders were expecting to see Enjin Coin turn a bit more bearish in the weeks to come. So far, that has not happened yet, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing either. Although the market is still going strong, there are plenty of losses which need to be made up in quick succession. It seems unlikely that all-time high will be reached again fairly soon, but the current uptrend remains in place without too many problems. To put this in perspective, the Enjin Coin price has gained another 5.73% to rise to $0.176785. In terms of ENJ/BTC, there is a 5.33% increase to 3,373 Satoshi. Last but not least, ENJ/ETH is also up by 2.95%, which further confirms the overall uptrend is still in place. When looking at the rest of the markets, it appears ENJ is firing on all cylinders. If the ENJ/BTC trend remains in place, things can get very interesting in the coming days and weeks. When pump and dump groups continue to pay attention to the same markets for an extended period of time, things will either collapse or get very interesting. For Enjin Coin, it appears the Binance VIPSignal group has high expectations for this particular altcoin despite noting some very solid profits in recent weeks. How high the market can go, remains to be determined, as everything is possible in this industry. What is equally interesting is how Enjin Coin has recently been listed on the Binance platform through a USDT trading pair. While this is not the first ENJ trading pair on Binance, it is an interesting addition. More gateways to get people into trading this altcoin can yield further liquidity, which is something this particular market would certainly benefit from. Last but not least, there is the view shared by Daniel Muvdi. This trader has pocketed 15% in profit with Enjin Coin over the past few days, which is impressive in its own regard. However, he expects even more positive momentum to materialize in the coming weeks, which is pretty interesting to keep an eye on. Whether or not this optimistic view will effectively materialize, is a different matter altogether. All things considered, there is plenty of positive momentum in the cryptocurrency market to ensure Enjin Coin continues inching up ever so slightly. A near 6% gain is impressive compared to other markets, thus it seems unlikely any further gains will materialize in the next few hours. However, there is always a chance a surprising breakout will occur, although one never knows what the near-term future will hold for Bitcoin and alternative markets.

While some markets successfully keep losses to a bare minimum, the Digitex Futures price is not necessarily putting up much of a fight. That comes as somewhat of a surprise, although it remains to be seen how things will evolve exactly. Fans of Digitex Futures will not be pleased with the way things are going right now. As this market noticed some pretty strong gains in recent weeks, many users expected the uptrend to continue for some time. However, that is not necessarily the case, as it now seems the price is retracing rather quickly. Most of the recent gains have been wiped out once again, yet it remains to be seen if another uptrend will materialize in the near future. More specifically, the Digitex Futures price has dropped to $0.118235 after another 6.82% decline. There are also losses in both BTC and ETH value, which will not come as too big of a surprise to most people. The bigger question is whether or not things can turn around for this altcoin even if Bitcoin remains in bearish territory. Right now, that seems rather unlikely, although altcoins usually tend to evolve in mysterious ways first and foremost. There are some pretty big developments taking place behind the scenes which would warrant a new uptrend in the near future. First of all, the team will be attending Paris Blockchain Week, which kicks off today. There will be a spotlight on DGTX in many different ways, albeit it remains unclear if this can have any effect on the price, either for better or worse. Attending events like these will help the DGTX branding effort, though, thus it is always worth exploring. The bigger news of this month is the impending launch of the Digitex Futures exchange platform on April 30th. This platform will operate under a zero-fee structure, which is always interesting to keep an eye on. Native exchanges for specific currencies are always a bit hit-and-miss. Some people see it as a way to inflate prices, whereas others see the benefit of additional trading liquidity. Only time will tell if this platform is beneficial in the end. MoondoggerMcKenzie is one of the \u2013 seemingly many? \u2013 traders who effectively sold a stack of Digitex Futures ahead of this dump. It is evident the most recent uptrend generated some pretty big profits for traders, but one has to keep in mind the long-term holders in the altcoin industry are hard to come by. For DGTX, the low trading volume makes it easier for dumps like these to influence the price in a negative manner. When looking at the bigger picture, it seems unlikely there will be any market reversal for altcoins, tokens, and assets until Bitcoin itself moves in the green again. When that will happen exactly, is anybody\u2019s guess, as the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has not shown any signs of doing just that. As such, Digitex Futures holders will need to bide their time and hope for things to improve in the very near future. Without more trading volume, it seems unlikely any major changes will occur, either for better or worse. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

There is no real bearish pressure to speak of just yet, but it seems a continuation of this strong uptrend might pose its own set of challenges. The Stellar price is still inching up, but its losses in BTC value can easily negate the push to $0.12. Volatility is nothing new in the cryptocurrency industry by any means. Bitcoin, altcoins, tokens, and assets all see very odd market shifts, even if they don\u2019t always make sense at that time. For now, most of the top markets remain in the green as they cling to minor gains first and foremost. However, it seems a few of these alternatives deal with pressure on their internal ratio over Bitcoin. That can trigger some minor USD losses if this trend keeps up. To put this in perspective, the current Stellar price is still up by 2.34% over the past 24 hours. That in itself is promising, as one XLM is now priced at $0.115763. What is rather worrisome is how XLM/BTC not just fails to note any gains, but has effectively dipped in the red on this Wednesday morning. A 0.27% drop is nothing significant, but it shows there may be some bearish pressure coming from that direction. There are some key developments taking place behind the scenes which may paint a positive outlook for Stellar. First of all, the number of active nodes and active validators continues to increase every quarter. That in itself is an ongoing sign of ecosystem growth and decentralized network support. Although it will not impact the price necessarily, any sort of growth is more than welcome for any project active in this industry today. Secondly, the Stellar team has released their Monthly Roundup for April of 2019. In this report is some interesting information pertaining to platform updates, events, and development projects driven by the community. These reports often get community members excited, as it shows the growth rate is still strong. Projects keeping the community engaged often tend to do well compared to those who struggle to communicate in any significant manner. Traders keeping a close eye on the XLM chart may have noticed the momentum can easily swing either way. More specifically, the XLM/BTC chart is not looking all that great right now, and there are little to no improvements in sight at this time. If the key trendline is broken in a bearish manner, there is a genuine chance the 2,200 Satoshi level will not hold for much longer. Even so, the current pressure isn\u2019t necessarily significant enough to warrant further bearish pressure in the coming hours. For the time being, it is difficult to determine where Stellar might be heading next. Although there is a chance this is the sign of bearish pressure looming on the horizon, it remains to be seen how things will play out exactly. Everything stands and falls based on what happens to Bitcoin. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency isn\u2019t under too much pressure as of yet, but things can always change in a heartbeat.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/holo-price-notes-impressive-gains-across-the-board/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Holo Price Notes Impressive Gains Across the Board", "content": "Whereas all cryptocurrency markets tend to show bullish signs, few of them have effectively noted any real gains in BTC or ETH volume today. That is not necessarily uncommon, although it may effectively disrupt some traders\u2019 expectations. The Holo price is a notable exception in this regard, as it is moving up across all markets in quick succession. A remarkable reversal after a very rough period. When all markets show bullish signs up to some degree, one has to wonder what the future will hold exactly. Bitcoin dictates the pace for all other offerings, which has been the case for quite some time now. However, this also means altcoins may effectively lose BTC value, which in turn negates some of their USD-based gains. That doesn\u2019t apply to Holo today, as it is one of the few markets in the top 40 to effectively note steep BTC-based gains alongside its USD-based uptrend. To be more specific, the Holo price has risen by 15.19% to rise back to $0.001462. However, there are also gains in HOT/BTC \u2013 11.36% \u2013 and HOT/ETH \u2013 12.18% \u2013 which show this uptrend has some legs to it. Although Holo has never had any impressive trading volume to begin with, it seems the $21.3m could be sufficient to keep this uptrend going for a few more hours. How high the price can go in the process, is a different matter altogether. There will be a glass ceiling at some point, albeit no one can accurately predict the top level at this time. Despite all of the positive Holo market momentum, there are those who refute this project and its future potential. Smart Investor is one of those people, as he expects AWS and Azure to simply clone Holo\u2019s technology and gain even more market traction in the process. Since Holo has, according to this user, no patents to speak of, there is always a chance bigger companies will copy this technology and commercialize it in the process. Most traders and enthusiasts will keep a very close eye on the price chart in the hours to come. According to Tony Satoshi, the uptrend is in full effect and may continue for quite some time to come. In fact, this user expects the price to more than double in the weeks to come. That might be a bit too optimistic at this time, although nothing is impossible in the cryptocurrency world these days. A somewhat similar sentiment is echoed by Ilker Ates, who expects the Holo party to continue for quite some time to come. In fact, he expects a HOT/BTC all-time high to materialize fairly soon, followed by a new ATH for HOT/ETH. Optimism is a good thing in the cryptocurrency world, but one also has to keep their emotions and expectations in check first and foremost. The year 2019 will not necessarily yield any all-time highs to speak of, although there are still seven and a half months to go. All things considered, Holo is one of the more impressive markets in the cryptocurrency industry as of right now. Whether or not it can sustain its gains or even improve upon the current levels, is a different matter altogether. As long as Bitcoin continues its uptrend, there is nothing to be overly concerned about just yet, but the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is known to be fickle more often than not.

The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency drags all other markets down with it once again, which creates some very uneasy market momentum. During times like these, the Dogecoin price usually makes a stand, yet it seems incapable of doing so this time around. It is only normal to see most of the altcoins on the market struggle when Bitcoin is in the red. Even though not all markets derive value from Bitcoin directly, it seems none can escape the negative pressure which ensues when Bitcoin is bleeding value. Dogecoin is usually a very resilient market in this regard, but it too suffers from minor setbacks all across the board. To be more specific, the Dogecoin price has dropped by another 2% to $0.0028. This value is still pretty solid where Dogecoin is concerned, although one has to wonder how long it can be sustained for. In terms of DOGE/BTC, things are not looking all that problematic despite a 0.5% decline to 55 Satoshi. All things considered, DOGE is still as resilient as it has been for several months, although the losses are still visible for everyone to see. On social media, there is never a shortage of support for Dogecoin whatsoever. Nuttee expects Dogecoin to hit $100 at some point, even though it seems incredibly unlikely that will ever be the case. It would certainly be interesting to see, though. He also wonders what brand of car people will drive when that level is hit, but it is safe to say most traders will have exceeded their expiration date before that happens. One just never knows when it comes to Dogecoin, however. Crypto Kuvera is looking at things from a slightly different perspective. Although the discussion pertaining to Binance and Dogecoin has been kicked around many times now, the exchange still doesn\u2019t support this popular altcoin. Kuvera expects DOGE to become available on Binance soon, yet has zero evidence to back up such outlandish claims. Anything can happen in this industry, but this listing seems rather unlikely. Speaking of which, CryptoPappy wouldn\u2019t mind seeing Binance replace the now delisted Bitcoin SV with Dogecoin. It would certainly make some sense up to a certain degree, as removing one pair should, in theory, allow for a different altcoin to be supported in the process. Whether or not the company will effectively replace BSV, remains unclear at this time. When looking at the bigger picture, it remains to be seen how all of the different cryptocurrency markets will behave in the coming hours and days. As anything remains possible under the current market conditions, there may be further losses or potentially a minor market reversal in the very near future. For Dogecoin, it seems the current levels could be maintained without real problems, although that situation is always subject to change first and foremost.

Since Bitcoin dictates the pace for all altcoins, tokens, and assets, its momentum is of great interest to many people. The EOS price is currently benefiting from this positive spell, although it might not necessarily regain the $5.5 level and turn it into support right away. When it comes to the different cryptocurrency markets, one has to wonder when the next breakout will occur. As of right now, it seems unlikely any major changes are expected, albeit one never really knows what the future will hold in this regard. For EOS, the current momentum seems promising, although there is some bearish pressure on EOS/BTC as well. This is in line with most of the alternative markets as of right now. To put everything in its proper perspective, the EOS price has gained 1.53% to rise to $5.48. It is not that far removed from the $5.5 level, although one never knows for sure if such \u201ccrucial\u201d levels can be reached in the coming hours and days. What is slightly more worrisome is the EOS/BTC dip of 1.55%, which can eventually drive the value down to 0.001 BTC or lower in the near future. That would be a worrisome development, although it might not necessarily happen for some time to come. On social media, there are a lot of tidbits of information to browse through. TrexCryptoMania shared an interesting picture which depicts further growth of the EOS dApp ecosystem, as well as its trading volume and transaction volume for the past week. All of these statistics are impressive in their own regard, albeit they may not have any impact on the price whatsoever. Even so, everything looks good where EOS is concerned, whereas ETH seems to be dropping off all across the board. Speaking of which, it would seem both Ethereum and EOS were top performing cryptocurrencies in the past week. However, Ethereum noted some big losses as well, whereas EOS seemingly managed to hold its own quite well without any major problems. How both markets will correlate throughout this week and the months to come, could prove to be rather interesting to keep an eye on. As has been the case for quite some time now, it seems EOS is subjected to arbitrage opportunities on a nearly daily basis. As of today, there are several options to explore in this regard, with profits going as high as 1.43%. While this might not necessarily be that appealing to some traders, any profit is better than having to deal with financial losses. As the EOS value seems to push toward $5.5 once again, one has to wonder how things will pan out in the very near future. As long as Bitcoin remains in the green, it seems rather likely to assume all other top markets will see a very similar pattern. The overall crypto trading volume still remains on the low side, for some reason, but that isn\u2019t deterring most of the markets at this time. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

All morning, the markets looked incredibly bearish, yet that ship ha snow sailed again. As Bitcoin shifts into a higher gear, the other markets are quick to follow. The Basic Attention Token price is moving up swiftly, as reaching $0.32 and beyond seems very plausible. It is commendable to see all cryptocurrencies move up so swiftly after what appeared to be a disastrous start of the week. Extensive bearish pressure on Monday and the early hours of Tuesday is never a good sign. However, it seems the industry has become a lot more resilient in recent months, as nearly all of those losses have been recuperated without any real problems. Over the past few hours, the Basic Attention Token price has gained another 7.11% as it rose to $0.315. There are also gains in BTC and ETH value, albeit those are less spectacular compared to the USD_based gains. What is a bit odd is how the overall crypto trading volume has dipped significantly. That may be an indication this bearish trend is far from over. On social media, there has never been a shortage of support for Basic Attention Token. Roger Williams sees the merit of BAT as a whole, primarily because it can be a powerful tool for both marketers and publishers alike. Although the ecosystem is still rather small right now, things seem to be progressing nicely where this token is concerned. Heverac, one of the many cryptocurrency traders to be found around the world, expects some upward price momentum to materialize in the near future. The Brave browser has been well received to date, thus there is tremendous potential waiting to be unlocked where BAT is concerned. Making it all come together to rival Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers will be a different matter altogether. When looking at the BAT price chart, there is always room for speculation. Isa hopes to see a new all-time high materialize where Basic Attention Token is concerned. Whether it will be this year or in a decade from now, will always be difficult to predict. Volatile markets are known for following very strange curves more often than not. When it comes to looking at the current market trend, it is a bit unclear what will happen over the coming hours.

The BitTorrent Token price is finally mounting some sort of rise, although the momentum is not sufficient enough to convince traders this is the promising sign of a major market reversal. When it comes to the different cryptocurrency markets, there is a severe reliance on Bitcoin first and foremost. Whereas the Bitcoin momentum is not necessarily all that impressive right now, it seems as if some markets are trying to take advantage at this time. BitTorrent Token falls into this category, as its current value is slowly rising. More specifically, there is a 6.4% BitTorrent Token price gain in USD, BTC, and TRX value alike which may keep traders engaged for a little while. Because of this minor rise, one BTT is now valued at $0.000741, or 15 Satoshi. Especially this latter value fails to impress, and it may not surpass 20 Satoshi for quite some time to come. Crypto Bids is trying to keep a positive attitude toward BitTorrent Token despite the lack of any exciting price momentum. He wouldn\u2019t mind selling it at $0.1 per BTT at some point, although one has to keep in mind such a value will not be reached anytime soon. In fact, it might never happen, for all one knows. Minexpert, one of the many Turkish traders making some noise on social media, has some hope for BitTorrent Token over the coming weekend. It is evident the current momentum might warrant cautious optimism, but these gains can be negated with one bearish hourly candle. Especially if Bitcoin were to slip again, BTT will come under plenty of pressure as well. A different view is shared by Jason Taylor, who sees this as the beginning of a potential bull trend for BTT. While that attitude is somewhat understandable, BitTorrent Token has no reason to turn bullish, no matter how badly traders want to see it happen. Even so, weekends are often unpredictable, thus anything is possible. For the time being, it remains to be seen what happens tot he Bitcoin price first and foremost. Depending on that outcome, the value of BTT may change for better or worse. It will be a very interesting weekend for most cryptocurrency markets, and BitTorrent Token will not necessarily be an exception in this regard. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Since everything hinges on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum, a fair few altcoins may find themselves in a bit of trouble. The Enjin Coin price is an interesting example. Following its price surge a few weeks ago, the overall downtrend is still in effect today. It has become apparent a lot of the top markets are under immense pressure right now. This is not uncommon where Mondays are concerned, yet it will make a lot of people very twitchy over the next few hours. Bitcoin is not looking all that great right now, which eventually drags all other markets down with it. It will be pretty interesting to see what kind of slaught one can expect, as every volatile period will yield new buying opportunities as well. As far as the Enjin Coin price is concerned, things are not looking very impressive either. Its recent pump to $0.45 has resulted in steep corrections shortly after. Even today, it still struggles to maintain the $0.16 level following this new 6.9% decline. There is also an 8% decline in both BTC and ETH value, further adding more pressure to Enjin Coin\u2019s trend as a whole. The trading volume, on the other hand, looks rather healthy, which is a positive sign. On social media, the price predictions involving ENJ are all over the place. Australian Chartists sold Enjin Coin simply because the 10% profit obtained over the weekend was the maximum they could get from trading this coin. As such, this subsequent decline may be a result of speculators cashing out in quick succession, although it remains to be seen how much damage that would cause. It seems this user doesn\u2019t favor buying ENJ again, even at the current value, which could be rather problematic. CryptoCheck is looking at different statistics to determine where ENJ may be heading next. In fact, he is mostly interested in what happens to ENJ/BTC in the coming days and weeks. While it is possible there may be a bottom in place for this pair, it seems unlikely there won\u2019t be further price decreases for Enjin Coin. Even so, a market reversal is always possible, regardless of how things may look at this time. Last but not least, there is the vision by CryptoNTez. He expected the ENJ breakout to continue today, but given the current market trend, it is evident that plan can be canceled altogether. While things looked great for ENJ nearly 24 hours ago, the momentum follows Bitcoin\u2019s chart almost to a fault. As such, there is no real surprise as far as the current downtrend is concerned. The coming hours may offer some interesting momentum regardless, as these markets can turn around on a dime. Recovering these losses may prove far less of a problem for Enjin Coin and consorts than most traders would think. While the ENJ/BTC and ENJ/ETH deficits are a different matter, the USD value of this altcoin might not remain in the red for very long. All it would take is bullish Bitcoin momentum, which can always happen when no one really expects it. Every dip is a buying opportunity, for those willing to take some medium-sized risks with their money. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Not entirely surprising, when considering how the Bitcoin value is subjected to a dip as well. The XRP price, while often relatively stable under most circumstances, is also losing a bit of value at this time. However, it seems to be able to contain those losses pretty well. It is always interesting to see how individual cryptocurrency markets deal with the overarching conditions. When Bitcoin turns bullish, everything seems fine and dandy. It is during bearish waves like the current one when projects earn their stripes, either for better or worse. In the case of XRP, it is following Bitcoin\u2019s trend, although it seems to contain the losses pretty well at this time. How long that will remain to be the case, is a different matter altogether. Over the past 24 hours, the XRP price has lost 2.24% to drop down to $0.3215. There is also a 0.8% decline in XRP/BTC, as this ratio now sits at just 6.320 Satoshi. The XRP/BTC market has been under a fair bit of pressure for quite some time now, and it seems unlikely any major reversal will occur in this department. That doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a bad sign by any means, but it is something well worth keeping an eye on as more time progresses. As is usually the case where social media is concerned, there are fans of XRP and people who will try to drive the project into the ground. Kieran Kelly falls into the first category, as he is quite pleased with how parent company Ripple is conducting itself right now. It is certainly true the perception of Ripple could have an impact on the XRP value in the next few months, even though they are two separate entities altogether. There are also Twitter accounts dedicated to keeping track of large sums of XRP being moved across the network. Werner Strydom isn\u2019t too pleased with these messages, primarily because they do not seem to contribute to the ecosystem. Additionally, it seems the movement of large amounts of XRP has not had any real impact on the market as a whole, thus it seems this information can be ignored first and foremost. For those who want to keep a close eye on the XRP chart moving forward, it would appear there is a lot of momentum ahead in many different ways. Deniz is keeping a close eye on XRP/BTC, even though this ratio has continued to decline for quite some time now. He expects a major bounce to occur when XRP hits 6,100 Satoshi, although a rebound to 20,000 Sats seems very unlikely under the current circumstances. All things considered, it would appear as if XRP is not doing all that bad at this time. While the losses can\u2019t be overlooked, it would appear things could improve pretty quickly. As the trading volume is still pretty close to the $1bn level, there may be a lot more momentum waiting to materialize in the coming hours. Whether that will be for better or worse, is difficult to predict at this time. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

That may come as a surprise to most, primarily because last week wasn\u2019t looking overly impressive by the time the weekend came around. The EOS price is still going strong right now, as it has successfully surpassed $5.5. Sustaining an uptrend on a Monday will always be a challenge for any market. It is always interesting to see how individual cryptocurrency markets evolve when a new week begins. In most cases, there will be some bearish pressure, although that doesn\u2019t appear to be affecting all markets as of right now. There is always a possibility a bearish trend will materialize in the near future, but for now, most of the top markets remain in the green. EOS is no exception in this regard, as its rise to $5.5 is pretty interesting to keep an eye on. To put this in perspective, the EOS price has gained 4.58% to rise to $5.54 on this Monday morning. There is also a 2.48% gain in EOS/BTC, as this ratio has now risen to 0.00107 Bitcoin. Both trends are pretty interesting in their own right, although it remains to be seen what the future will hold for this particular market. Other assets and tokens are coming under a bit of bearish of pressure already, yet it remains to be seen how EOS handles this pressure in the coming days and weeks. On social media, there are always some interesting views on the different cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets. CryptoTIm is now seemingly convinced Twitter is designed for people so they can keep tabs on EOS related things. It is a bit of a stretch, although one has to keep in mind cryptocurrencies would be less attractive if it weren\u2019t for platforms like Twitter. The real purpose of this social media network is very different, though, but everyone is entitled to their own thoughts. Some community members are also getting excited regarding the upcoming Block One event which is taking place during June. Although it remains to be seen if there will be any major announcements, events usually get cryptocurrency users excited in general. Conferences like these also bring the EOS community closer together, which can only be beneficial to the ecosystem as a whole, in the end. When it comes to looking at the current and future price trend, there are still a lot of questions which can\u2019t be answered right now. Varun Mehra claims EOS is on a bull trend and will continue down this line for some time to come. A bit of an optimistic view when the hourly charts for all markets don\u2019t look too appealing. However, cryptocurrency is an unpredictable industry first and foremost, thus anything can happen in the coming hours and days. While EOS is still showing some bullish signs, surpassing the $5.5 level will undoubtedly meet some resistance levels in the coming hours. For traders, it is usually all about surpassing psychological barriers first and foremost, and $5.5 is one of those key levels for EOS. The trading volume still looks pretty strong, thus there may not be too much of a dip today. However, everything stands and falls with Bitcoin, and the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t look too strong at this time. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Most of the markets are currently in the green again, yet it seems the bearish pressure will not relent just yet. As far as the Binance Coin price is concerned, it would appear the current uptrend may not remain in place for too much longer. When a new week comes around and Bitcoin is still in the green, there is plenty of reason to be cautiously optimistic. However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean all of the alternative markets will go through similar momentum. More often than not, a positive Bitcoin trend is nefast for altcoins, albeit things are not looking too bad right now. Binance Coin still notes some gains, although it will dip in the red fairly quickly at this rate. To be more specific, the Binance Coin price currently sits at $19.5. This represents a 2.37% increase in USD value, which is more than acceptable under the current market circumstances. The bigger concern is how BNB is already in the red over Ether, and the 0.52% gain over Bitcoin might not remain in place for much longer either. Mondays are known for their overall volatility, thus this trend is not entirely surprising either. On social media, it would appear as if there is some additional information regarding Binance\u2019s BNB burn. As most users are aware of, BNB coins are burned every single quarter, although the amount is not necessarily communicated in advance. As such, users can now predict how many tokens will be destroyed in the coming weeks. This burn phase will help reduce the overall supply, thus potentially trigger a Binance Coin value change in the process. There is also another interesting tidbit of information which no one can refute. As Chuck Costellos shows, there is a genuine rate of engagement regarding Binance Coin. While these statistics are never indicative of what a project may be all about in the long run or how its price will evolve, it would appear people enjoy talking about BNB regardless. Whether or not this will aid in the push to $20, is a different matter altogether. Speaking of the current and future BNB price, it would appear the current chart doesn\u2019t necessarily look too appealing either. As the latest push has not been officially confirmed, it would appear a downtrend is in order. This is in line with the current BNB value decline in ETH value, with its BTC value likely to follow pretty quickly. How dire things will get, remains to be determined, but for now, it seems the uptrend has come to an end. When looking at the bigger picture, a trend established on Monday morning isn\u2019t necessarily indicative of what this week will bring to the table. Considering how all cryptocurrencies rely on Bitcoin first and foremost, there will always be some volatility. Binance Coin will not be able to escape this negative trend at this time, although it seems unlikely any major changes should be expected. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Not entirely surprising when considering how weak Bitcoin has looked since Sunday afternoon. For Electroneum price watchers, things are not looking too great right now. The ongoing decline continues to haunt the market and trigger a drop to below 110 Satoshi soon. Despite what is widely considered to be a big year for Electroneum already, it appears things are not necessarily looking too great right now. More specifically, no one is discounting the developments taking place behind the scenes. On the price front, however, things are looking a bit different in recent weeks. No major uptrend has materialized, although no one knows for sure why that is the case exactly. Over the past 24 hours, the Electroneum price has dipped by a further 0.26% to $0.005778. There is also a 1.71% deficit in ETN/BTC, as that level has now dropped down to 112 Satoshi. It seems very likely this ratio will hit 100 Satoshi or even lower regions in the coming hours. The bearish pressure affecting most cryptocurrency markets shows no signs of relenting just yet, which will not please too many traders whatsoever. On social media, most community members try to keep the faith and hope for better days ahead. One prominent development is shared by Electroneum mart Uganda. Another native resident successfully bought a 16GB memory card for their phone while using Electroneum. It is a very promising turn of events, as it would appear Uganda may become a crucial region for ETN usage in the near future. Drshepard shares some interesting news, although it has not been officially confirmed by the Electroneum team at this time. More specifically, he claims an Instant Payment System patent is pending, which would allow it easier for ETN to gain mainstream traction over the coming years. It also involves using off-chain transactions to achieve instant payments, which would be rather interesting to keep an eye on. Such features can pave the way for a brighter future where Electroneum is concerned. Crypto Bezos, on the other hand, tries to keep an eye on the bigger picture, rather than chasing short-term price changes right now. It is certainly true the final quarter of 2018 was pretty good for ETN, yet it seems most of that momentum has now evaporated completely. There is still a long way to go to draw any real conclusions where these altcoins are concerned, as the cryptocurrency industry is an ever-evolving creature first and foremost. For the time being, the latest leg of this bearish pressure will need to be endured by Electroneum holders. How things will look within a few hours and days from today, is a very different matter altogether. Since none of the major markets look to be in great shape right now, there is no real reason to expect any major reversal to occur in the near future. The big question is whether or not ETN can remain above 110 Satoshi for another day, as that seems rather unlikely. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

As of right now, most of the markets are regaining some lost value, which is good to see. Even the Binance Coin price is moving up in quick succession, which will undoubtedly get some holders excited. Reaching $18 level again should not be too much of a problem under these circumstances. As soon as Bitcoin started showing signs of recovery this morning, it was a matter of time until alternative markets followed suit. As of right now, nearly the entire top 20 is in the green, albeit there will always be some temporary exceptions. Binance Coin, which had a bit of a rough week for some unknown reason, is currently recouping those losses in quick succession. It may take some time until a new attempt at $20 takes shape, however. Over the past few hours, the Binance Coin price has regained 5% in lost value as it rose to $17.88 again. There is also a 4.4% gain in both BNB/BTC and BNB/ETH, which is all traders are looking for right now. The only downside right now is how the trading volume is still on the low side, but it is expected that will pick up as well. As long as Bitcoin remains in the green, it seems likely the alternative markets will follow suit. Social media has come to life again following this rather unexpected crypto uptrend. As far as BNB is concerned, RB3 is convinced buying the token yesterday during the dip was one of the better decisions to make. Everyone likes some juicy profits every now and then, and it seems Binance Coin is capable of delivering exactly that during this time. How long that will remain to be the case, is a very different matter, as that primarily depends on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum. Flo S has a more cynical view when it comes to the current crypto market trend. More specifically, this user singles out BNB and BTT for a very specific reason. While it remains to be seen if any \u201cump\u201d will materialize in quick succession, remains to be determined. As the weekend is just around the corner, there may be some interesting market momentum waiting to materialize. Crypto Expert, on the other hand, is simply looking at the BNB chart in search of potential profits and new market trends. While the user hints at how \u201clots of news is coming\u201d, it remains to be seen what will happen to this market specifically. For now, there is some chance for major upward momentum, although most traders will acknowledge things can easily fall apart when people least expect it. Based on the overall market momentum, it would appear things can get pretty interesting for most of the markets in the next few hours. Assuming Bitcoin successfully remains in the green, there may be a lot of profit waiting to be pocketed. Everything stands or falls with Bitcoin, however, and the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is still on wobbly legs first and foremost. As such, anything can happen, either for better or worse.

Fans of the XRP price will be less happy right now, as their favorite currency has noted rather steep losses. Nothing that can\u2019t be overcome with some effort, but it shows how much Ripple\u2019 asset relies on Bitcoin. All cryptocurrency markets will follow Bitcoin\u2019s momentum, either for better or worse. Today, it is evident the bearish pressure has gotten to all markets in quick succession, which paints a rather bleak picture. Nothing seems to indicate these losses will remain in place very long, but turning the ship around will not be easy either under these circumstances. As far as the XRP price is concerned, the current losses paint a rather intriguing picture. The 7.35% decline in USD value has forced the price lower, but it has not dropped below $0.33 s of yet. More interestingly, it seems XRP/BTC is far less bearish than expected, with just a 2.27% loss. This is an indicator of how quickly things can improve in this industry, albeit one has to take everything in stride. As so many traders keep a close eye on the XRP chart, it quickly becomes apparent different opinions are formed in the process. Tex S Hodlem sees an unusual trend, as it seems there have been numerous instances where XRP went in the red in the sixth week after the previous dip. So far, it seems unlikely major losses will occur today, albeit one never knows what these markets have in store. A somewhat unusual observation if shared by Dutch xrPal. Rather than looking at this trend from a negative standpoint, he expects the \u201cdip restoration\u201d to kick in like it did last time. There is a certain correlation between the two most recent dips, albeit history won\u2019t always repeat itself either. Last but not least, there is still some dismay over Coinbase not adding XRP at this time. Costa Rica Kely is not giving up on seeing this happen, yet it has become rather apparent Coinbase has little to no interest in Ripple\u2019s native asset. It is their decision first and foremost, although one that still raises plenty of eyebrows within the XRP community. Given how XRP is struggling far less in its BTC ratio compared to most other alternative markets, there is a chance some losses could be recovered in that regard. If so, the USD-based losses might be offset ever so slightly, although without a Bitcoin rebound, that seems unlikely.

As Bitcoin remains stuck in the red, it is only normal alternative markets see a similar trend. One notable exception comes in the form of the Waltonchain price, which is moving up without too many problems. A surprising turn of events, but one that also shows the bears might not be here to stay. In the cryptocurrency world, virtually all markets will follow Bitcoin\u2019s price trend first and foremost. That is only normal, as all of these currencies are traded against Bitcoin as their main trading offering. This can cause a lot of problems for these markets moving forward, as they will lose a lot of value when Bitcoin is dropping in price. Waltonchain is an interesting exception today, even though its gains are not necessarily all that steep either. Over the past 24 hours, the Waltonchain price has risen by 3.65% to climb back to $2.06. There is also a 7% gain in WTC/BTC and a 7.8% gain in WTC/ETH. Both of these trends are pretty interesting in this regard, although it remains to be seen what the future will hold exactly. With $6.44m in overall trading volume, Waltonchain may be rather limited in terms of where it can go moving forward, but this uptrend is rather promising in terms of seeing some bullish momentum amid a sea of bearish pressure. On social media, traders are still chasing any profit they can obtain right now. As such, WTC has become a very interesting market for these people. TH3000 Crypto Bot is spreading the good word by showing how WTC/BTC is the ratio to keep an eye on in the altcoin industry right now. Crossing the 14-day EMA Is a pretty bullish sign, although it may be a fake breakout as well, for all one knows. A similar sentiment is echoed by Papa Coiner, who likes to see this action taking place where WTC/BTC is concerned. More specifically, this market is going full steam ahead as of right now, but one has to keep in mind how this uptrend may not remain in place for very long. After all, the low trading volume can be a massive hindrance for Waltonchain, as there isn\u2019t too much genuine interest in this market as of yet. For those who simply want to look at the price chart itself, it would appear the rebound and subsequent pump has caught a lot of people by surprise. Bumblebtc sees this as a \u201cnice pump\u201d, although others may have very different opinions regarding this market. Its major decline since the past price increase is a clear indication of how up-and-down this market can really be. Chasing the pump is never a smart idea in this regard. For altcoins, the coming hours may prove to be very crucial in terms of noting any sort of comeback. Waltonchain is clearly leading the pack in this regard, although it seems likely this artificial uptrend may come to an end in the very near future as well. Even so, the gains over both Bitcoin and Ethereum are pretty interesting to keep an eye on right now, as those show altcoins can mount a comeback during these trying times.

Many people turn to Dogecoin to see where things may head in the very near future. So far, it seems the Dogecoin price hasn\u2019t recovered as of yet, but there is a chance things will improve in the near future. It is quite interesting to keep an eye on all of the cryptocurrency markets in this day and age. Considering how everything stands or falls with Bitcoin, one would expect the altcoins to struggle quite significantly. That is certainly the case right now, although things have started to look less dire compared to a few hours ago. As such, some sense of recovery now has the markets in its grip, which can yield some unexpected market momentum in the process. Over the past 24 hours, the Dogecoin price has still lost 4.16% as it dropped to $0.002764. This means the $0.003 level will not be recovered in the very near future, which may displease quite a few traders in the process. However, in DOGE/BTC, things are starting to look up. While there is still a deficit, the 1.04% loss is far less steep compared to other markets. At this time, one DOGE sits at the 55 Satoshi level, which is pretty interesting at this time. A small rebound may occur in that ratio, which can have a positive impact on Dogecoin\u2019s USD value as well. While the price changes may be going on, things are seemingly heating up behind the scenes. Huobi US is currently launching a Dogecoin4charity campaign. Every Huobi signup and level 1 verification will receive 1 DOGE. Additionally, the company will donate 1,000 DOGE per verified sign up to Grateful Dogs Rescue in San Francisco. It is a very interesting campaign to keep an eye on, which may bring some more positive attention to the Dogecoin project as a whole. There is also a chance Dogecoin will be officially supported by Trust Wallet in the near future. The company hosts a poll on Twitter where users can vote for one of four projects to be supported next. Dogecoin faces some stiff competition in the form of Cardano, NEO, and EOS, but it is an interesting option to gain more exposure for DOGE within the cryptocurrency industry. For now, it seems Cardano has the most votes, however. Most people know Dogecoin because of the amazing memes shared by community members at regular intervals. Bobby Hill has combined Game of Thrones with Dogecoin in this latest meme, which would put a very interesting spin on this popular show. It brings a chuckle to most people, which is all one needs during this bearish pressure. The creativity of Dogecoin community members never ceases to amaze when it comes to the memes. Unless DOGE/BTC goes through a major bull run in the coming hours and days, it seems unlikely the DOGE/USD ratio will improve in quick succession. However, Bitcoin itself looks less weak compared to yesterday afternoon, which may be indicative of somewhat of a market reversal.

As Bitcoin flashes in the green ever so slightly, the other top markets should be able to recover pretty quickly. So far, not all markets are doing so, as the XRP price is still clearly in the red. On the one hand, it is good to see nearly all of the top cryptocurrency markets regain some lost value in quick succession. Yesterday was not the best of days by any means, yet it seems things may be on the mend at this time. For XRP, unfortunately, it seems things are not looking too great, although the current trend isn\u2019t exactly bothersome either. It will take some time to recover the lost value, That is not necessarily a bad thing either, but it will upset some traders regardless. To be more specific, the XRP price is still down by 1.4% in USD value, as it sits at $0.327291. There is also an ongoing decline in XRP/BTC, resulting in a 1.7% drop 6,456 Satoshi. It has become more than apparent the XRP/BTC ratio is struggling for quite some time now, and there are little to no improvements in sight right now. Its USD value, however, should be capable of recovering without too many problems, assuming Bitcoin can move up by a few percents. On social media, it seems XRP to the M is not too pleased with the way things are going. However, the stability affecting XRP is not necessarily a bad thing either at this time, primarily because other markets are very volatile first and foremost. Even so, it seems as if XRP will be capable of recovering without too many problems, although one never knows what the future will hold for this individual market. For those looking at the price chart, some interesting momentum can be noted depending on where one decides to look. More specifically, the XRP/JPY market is showing signs of an uptrend right now, which may be indicative of what will happen to the USD value as more time progresses. Japan is a pretty big country when it comes to cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets, and there is still an interest in XRP as of right now. It would appear some traders are seeing a lot of different things when it comes to XRP, however. Skyler McCrary seems to think the current XRP chart is trying to convey a message of sorts, albeit no one knows for sure what message that would be exactly. After a while, one has to make up their own chart trends, but this may be taking things a bit too far. All things considered, it seems as if XRP will be recovering its lost value without too many problems. Although it may not necessarily occur today, the current trend is not as worrisome as most people would have expected at this time. If Bitcoin remains in the green, it seems to be a matter of time until all markets go through another bullish trend. How that will affect XRP exactly, remains to be determined at this time.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/tron-price-bites-the-dust-as-bears-shake-up-all-markets/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Tron Price Bites the Dust as Bears Shake up all Markets", "content": "The bearish cryptocurrency momentum affecting most, if not all markets, is taking its toll on some of the top altcoins. When Bitcoin puts on the brakes in an aggressive manner, other markets tend to follow suit pretty quickly. If the Tron price is any example of what is yet to come, today will not be a good day by any means. Its value has absolutely tanked and continues to drift lower every hour. It is rather uncommon to see a market on the level of Tron lose so much value in very quick succession. While it is not the first time this happens, once also has to wonder how dire things will get in the hours and days ahead. For now, it seems the onslaught is in full effect, as roughly $10bn has been wiped off the total cryptocurrency market cap in just a few hours\u2019 time. That is usually an indication things will remain pretty brutal moving forward. Over the past few hours, the Tron price has declined to $0.026, which represents a 13.88% decline. Things are not looking much better in TRX/BTC territory, as the altcoin lost over 10.2% in that regard a swell. Despite a jump to 600 Satoshi seeming rather plausible on Monday, that momentum has now been eroded completely. The bigger question is whether TRX can remain above 500 Satoshi for much longer, as the pressure continues to mount. Despite the negative price pressure, Justin Sun is trying to keep the momentum alive for Tron on social media. He looks back on the progress achieved throughout the past six months. It is certainly impressive to see how Tron has grown ever since, but it seems that growth alone will not necessarily warrant prominent price changes. Additionally, a lot of people think Sun is just a \u201chustler\u201d, whereas others wonder when BTT will finally get a pump. One simply can\u2019t please cryptocurrency enthusiasts these days, it seems. As one would come to expect, there is a very strong focus on the TRX price chart at this time. CryptoJunky expected a big correction to kick in sooner or later, although he does regret not using a stop loss in the process. When markets turn sour in such a violent fashion, a stop loss order would certainly be of great value. For now, traders have to wait and see how dire things will get before the price can bounce back. John Peters van Ton is in the same boat, sort of. This trader sees this as an ABC correction, which does not necessarily warrant him to sell his positions by any means. It is an interesting buy opportunity for those who are confident Tron will bounce back in the future, as this lower price can allow for some quick profits in the not-so-distant future. Cost-averaging down one\u2019s positions is never a bad idea, although it\u2019s never wise to put too many eggs in one basket. When looking at all the other markets, it shows Tron is not the only one facing a fair bit of pressure right now. It has noted some higher losses compared to other markets, but it can also potentially recover that lost value a lot quicker if things turn around. For now, the losses will need to be taken in stride, as everyone waits for Bitcoin to turn around again. That may take a while, as the weekend is just around the corner as well.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/litecoin-price-heads-below-80-following-major-dip/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Litecoin Price Heads Below $80 Following Major Dip", "content": "When the Bitcoin price goes in the deep red without any real reason, the altcoins will be quick to follow. Although traders and investors do not like to see things heading down this path, there is little one can do about it at the current pace. The Litecoin price, while usually relatively stable, is also under a lot of pressure. Its value has dipped below $80 and could even drop below $75 in very quick succession. While it is rather normal to see all cryptocurrency markets go through a correction of some sorts, no one expected losses of 10% or more for some of the top altcoins. That in itself makes this line of developments all the more interesting, although one has to keep in mind things can easily reverse course in quick succession. For Litecoin, it seems the steep losses are facing some resistance, but the overall trend is not necessarily all that worrisome just yet. To put this in perspective, the Litecoin price has lost over 10.5% in USD value, as it currently sits at $78.63. A drop below $80 was not necessarily what users expected, given how LTC was priced at $94 just a day or two ago. Even so, this mainly because of Bitcoin\u2019s downtrend, combined with losses in LTC/BTC of 7.35%. As such, it will be interesting to see if Litecoin remains below $80 for long, or bounces back in rather quick succession. When looking across social media, it quickly becomes apparent there is a major focus on the current price chart, which is only normal. B. Lorenz expects a buy opportunity for Litecoin to materialize in the very near future, although it remains to be seen if that will yield some buy pressure or further losses in the coming hours. As long as the value remains near $77, there is nothing to worry about as of right now. Teklordz sees this current momentum as a \u201chealthy pullback\u201d, which might be a bit of a stretch. It is not necessarily the biggest concern whatsoever, but if the value would drop below $75, it seems likely a lot of people will grow wary first and foremost. One thing to keep in mind is how Litecoin is seemingly a lot more volatile compared to Bitcoin, which may not be the most promising sign. Last but not least, there is a chart shared by Justfive. Longing Litecoin at its lowest point reached today is a very gutsy move, although it may very well play out for the better. Assuming there is a bounce, things will effectively pick up steam pretty quickly. However, there is also a chance the market will continue down this bearish path, which would put a lot of pressure on Litecoin and other crypto markets as well. When looking at all of the other markets, it would appear things could get pretty interesting moving forward. If Bitcoin can overcome this dip without too many problems, the overall bulltrend may very well continue for quite some time to come. However, that bounce needs to materialize ahead of the weekend, or things could get out of hand even further. For Litecoin, the momentum will primarily depend on what happens to Bitcoin.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/stellar-price-struggles-to-overcome-the-dip-despite-promising-developments/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Stellar Price Struggles to Overcome the dip Despite Promising Developments", "content": "As the week nears the halfway point, it will be interesting to see which markets can perform and which will fall apart. So far, the overall uptrend is still rather evident, although things can easily change. The Stellar price remains in the red at this time, although its bullish hourly chart might help change that fact pretty quickly. It is always interesting to keep an eye on the many different cryptocurrencies, tokens, and digital assets available today. Although it remains to be seen how things will evolve exactly, there is still a lot of bullish momentum brewing behind the scenes. As Bitcoin continues its uptrend, Stellar seems to struggle for traction a bit. Not that big of a deal, as this deficit can be overcome without too many problems if the trading volume picks up again. Over the past 24 hours, the Stellar price is still down by 1.1% as it dropped to $0.127127. There is also a dip in XLM/BTC< which drives that ratio down to 2,423 Satoshi. Neither of these developments are extremely worrisome, although they do seem to buck the overall trend affecting most markets right now. As such, there is a genuine chance things will get pretty interesting moving forward, albeit one never knows what the future will hold for this particular market. There is still some excitement regarding the use of Stellar\u2019s network by Western Union. Albeit the remittance giant initially showed an interest in Ripple, it seems the company is keeping all options on the table at this time. Which solution the company will work with in the end, remains to be seen, as both Stellar and RIpple have their own advantages and downsides. The bigger news of the week so far comes in the form of Astrograph. This represents a gateway to the Stellar blockchain ecosystem through a single GraphQL endpoint. For corporations and developers, this can have some very big consequences in terms of developing new products and services. Developments like these can help advance a blockchain ecosystem to a whole new level over the years to come. For those traders who simply want to make some money at all costs, there are a few arbitrage opportunities available involving XLM. A price difference between Binance/KuCoin and Bitexen can make interested parties some decent profit in the process. Bitexen is not the most liquid exchange by any means, but it is still an option worth looking into for a quick buck regardless. The big question is when Stellar will recover from this dip and where its value will head next in the process. As of right now, it seems the overall bullish momentum affecting most markets will spill over to XLM as well, albeit no major gains are expected at this time. A day of minor gains would not hurt this industry either, even if it makes things far less exciting compared to the past week. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/ethereum-price-drops-to-171-yet-dip-seems-to-be-short-lived/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Ethereum Price Drops to $171 yet Dip Seems to be Short-lived", "content": "When the Bitcoin price starts to head south in rather quick succession, it is evident the rest of the markets will follow suit pretty quickly. The Ethereum price, while going through a bit of a run recently, is now facing a fair struggle in terms of maintaining the $170 level. It has become apparent this latest uptrend may have come to an end for now, but that doesn\u2019t mean things will not improve in the near future. It is never good to see all of the top crypto markets dip in the red so quickly, but that is how things go in an industry primarily relying on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum. Ethereum, while often considered to be very different from Bitcoin and some other major competitors, tends to follow the BTC price trend to a T more often than not. Today is an interesting example in that regard, as this market has lost 5 times as much value as Bitcoin in terms of percentiles, which is quite telling. To put this in perspective, the Ethereum price has lost 5.32% to drop to $171.29. Depending on how the markets evolve in the coming hours, it seems likely a drop to $170 or potentially even lower is rather likely. In terms of ETH/BTC, there is also a fair bit of pressure, resulting in a 4.57% loss. One Ether is still valued at 0.03289 Bitcoin, thus it seems those losses will not make much of an impact in this regard. What is rather interesting is what the future will hold for Ethereum, both in terms of its price and the actual developments under the hood. Joseph Lubin recently touched upon what may be in store for Ethereum. It seems Ethereum is destined to become the \u201cglobal settlement layer\u201d, but also play a key role in terms of privacy features. Some people may look at this is an ambitious outlook, although the technology is being put together to make it happen. Looking beyond those features, it seems some of the core problems affecting blockchain and cryptocurrency are still waiting to be solved. The Crypto Lark confirms scalability will always remain a topic of debate, primarily because it has proven to be very difficult to achieve. This doesn\u2019t just apply to Ethereum either, but it is evident this project is often looked at as one the big contenders to solve this issue. When looking at the current prices, it is evident people have a varying degree of expectations. The Secret Trader, for example, still expects a drop to $80 for Ethereum, after which the altcoin will suddenly jump to $1,400 in the months to come. This would require Bitcoin to drop to $3,000 again, after which the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency moves up to the $20,000 range. Rather interesting predictions, although it is possible none of them will come true in the end. For the time being, it seems the Ether value should remain above the $170 level without too many problems. However, there is a genuine chance this value may be broken in the very near future, albeit potentially briefly. Ethereum still has a rather high amount of trading volume, and it seems Bitcoin\u2019s price dip will not be too severe at this time. As such, this dip could be over sooner than people realize.

This trend has been forming for a little while now, although most traders expect the losses to be contained first and foremost. That may not necessarily be the case for all markets, as the VeChain price is losing a fair bit of value in rather quick succession. In the cryptocurrency world, there is never a price trend which has proven to be sustainable for the very long run. It seems such a trend will not necessarily materialize throughout 2019 either, although the rollercoaster ride is less apparent in recent months compared to previous years. As Bitcoin is dipping in the red once again, all of the alternative markets are quickly following suit at an alarming pace. As far as the VeChain price is concerned, it seems the pressure is getting the best of this market in quick succession. With a 7.47% loss, the price has now dropped to $0.006810. In terms of VET/BTC, the pressure is also heating up, resulting in a 6.8% decline to 131 Satoshi. As the trading volume also seems to decrease significantly, one has to wonder if and when this market will rebound again. So far, there is no indicator that will happen right away. Despite all of the negative price pressure, it shows the VeChain ecosystem is still firing on all cylinders. The partnership with DNV GL is slowly paying off, as the company\u2019s \u201cseal of approval\u201d is now appearing on physical products. This is all made possible thanks to VeChain\u2019s underpinning technology to bring a lot more transparency to products and their origin. A very prominent development, although one that will not necessarily influence the price in any way over the coming months and years. There is also another update regarding PlayTable, a project which seems to have caught a fair bit of attention in recent weeks. This new gaming device will be powered by VeChainThor\u2019s blockchain. While the product has been in development for quite some time now, it appears the closed beta will be coming to an end very soon. No product ship date has been confirmed at this time, but it seems everything is coming together nicely. For those who are merely watching the VET chart right now, it would appear this downtrend is not necessarily all that surprising. Lotus predicted there would be a price collapse in the near future. Depending on how things evolve, a drop to $0.0062 is not entirely out of the question. This is not what traders are looking for exactly, but there is very little one can do about it as of right now. As is to be expected during bearish times like these, it seems unlikely VeChain or any similar markets will recover value in quick succession. Unless Bitcoin turns around again, there will be plenty of red across all charts, for rather obvious reasons. Even if Bitcoin goes on another bull run, VET may not be able to benefit, as its VET/BTC ratio will remain under a ton of pressure in the process.

The ongoing increase in Bitcoin value can easily drive altcoin prices down. The Enjin Coin price seems to fall in this latter category, as it is incapable of maintaining its value for very long this week. It is not entirely abnormal to see altcoins lose a bit of value when Bitcoin goes through an extended bull trend. After all, altcoins derive value from Bitcoin, yet these trends tend to drive down the internal value between said altcoin and Bitcoin. Enjin Coin knows this struggle all too well, as its BTC-based losses force the USD value down as well. More specifically, the Enjin Coin price is down by just over 3% as it dropped to $0.148364. There is also a 6.51% loss in ENJ /BTC and a 5.57% loss in ENJ/ETH. These two latter ratios cause the downward slope in USD value, and it seems things may not necessarily improve in the near future either. On social media, the Enjin Coin community remain hopeful things will pick up again fairly soon. CryptoKing expects a target of 3.300 Satoshi to be hit, which would require a near 35% increase in value over the coming hours and days. Reaching the ultimate target of 10,200 Satoshi will not happen anytime soon, but one can always hope for a brighter future. For those users who are mainly looking at the ENJ chart, the coming hours will offer some fireworks in any case. Posty expects the support level to hold true, but if this market keeps getting hammered, that may prove to be a very difficult task. If the support is broken decisively, this market may continue its downward spiral for some time to come. John, on the other hand, hopes to see some form of improvement in ENJ/BTC first and foremost, albeit it seems unlikely any real changes will occur right away. Bitcoin is tearing it up again, which will drag all alternative markets down a bit in the process. Enjin Coin will not escape that trend, no matter how hopeful one may be. Although it seems as if the Enjin Coin momentum is far from promising, it is not the only market going through some struggles. This may be the beginning of a downward surge for most altcoins, at least until Bitcoin stabilizes again and the losses can be recuperated by alternative markets. For now, it seems unlikely a reversal will occur, but one never knows how these volatile markets will evolve. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Not every day can be ludicrously bullish, but the Cardano price seems to be on a different level at this time. Its solid gains continue to push the price higher, as reaching $0.1 is not that far off any longer. A lot of people will be quite pleased to see the bullish cryptocurrency momentum continue for yet another day. Although there is always a chance a major dip will kick in sooner rather than later, the crisis has seemingly been averted once again. As long as Bitcoin remains in the green, the rest of the markets seem to follow suit. Cardano is no exception in this regard, which will please a lot of ADA holders. Over the past 24 hours, the Cardano price has gained another 8.2% as it rose to $0.091768. There is also a 4.3% gain in ADA/BTC, pushing that particular value to just under 1,700 Satoshi. Both of these trends are very promising, even though Cardano seems to note a bit lower trading volume all of a sudden. Not all markets see a massive influx of money, after all. It seems there is plenty of genuine excitement surrounding Cardano at this time. Cryptohunter70 is looking forward to the Shelley update which is expected to come to Cardano\u2019s main net in the very near future. It is a crucial protocol upgrade which can shape the future of this project in many different ways. FristyXRP, who is usually a supporter of Ripple\u2019s native asset first and foremost, is also keeping a close eye on Cardano. More specifically, he wonders if Uphold would list ADA in the near future. According to the company, this is indeed a popular request, but no immediate plans can be unveiled at this time. Some open communication regarding this type of feedback is certainly appreciated. Last but not least, most ADA watchers and enthusiasts simply have skin in the game to make some money along the way. Surferocrypto is one of those individuals who love the green candles forming on the Cardano and Bitcoin charts. It is certainly true Cardano is going through a rather bullish period right now, and it seems unlikely the momentum will slow down in the coming hours or even days. It is good to see virtually all top markets resume their uptrend despite facing some minor pressure in the first three days of the week. This leads to believe the bear market may be further away than some may think, albeit the bears still cast a shadow over all markets regardless. For Cardano, reaching $0.1 seems a distinct possibility, but the final 10% gain may be the hardest to accomplish. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Today offers a bit of a mixed bag in terms of markets rising and declining in quick succession. While Bitcoin remains rather bullish, the Tron price is one of the biggest rises of today. A very impressive trend, albeit one that may be difficult to sustain. It is always good to see crypto markets resume their promising momentum after an action-packed weekend. While weekends are never indicative as to what the rest of the week will bring, it seems Tron\u2019s momentum was right on the money. Contrary to many people\u2019s expectations, the TRX value shows no signs of declining. Over the past 24 hours, the Tron price has gained another 8.75% to rise to $0.031114. There is also a 7.43% gain in TRX/BTC, which pushes that value to just under 600 Satoshi. Both trends are very impressive in this regard, as they are sustained by over $752m worth of trading volume. As such, a reversal seems rather unlikely at this time. As one would come to expect, there is a rather positive attitude toward Tron brewing across social media. CryptoYeshe, for example, remains convinced Tron is going for the lead. That means it should overtake Bitcoin at some point, which is nigh impossible. However, there is a chance the price will remain in the green for some time to come, albeit that will primarily depend on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum. A similar sentiment is echoed by GuiCryptoGui, although this user is seemingly trying to provoke a reaction first and foremost. Asking where the Tron haters are will always draw some unwanted attention, although there is some merit to this attitude as well. It seems a lot of hate toward Tron has disappeared in recent weeks, which is rather unusual. For those interested in dealing with the TRX chart, the market can still swing either way without any real problems. Crypto Tone expects a push to $0,05 to materialize fairly soon, which would result in a near 65% price increase. Not entirely impossible, but not all that realistic either. When looking at the big picture, the markets mainly flash bullish signals as this new week commences. It is certainly possible some altcoins, tokens, r assets will face bearish pressure, although it should not result in any serious losses. For Tron, turning $0.03 into a support level will be the first order of business. If that is done successfully there may be a sustainable uptrend in its future.

While some markets are struggling for traction, the ABBC Coin price simply doesn\u2019t fall into this category, It seems to pump and dump on regular intervals, with today showcasing some very bullish momentum for no apparent reason other than \u201cbecause it can\u201d. Over the past few months, very few currencies have made traders a lot of good money in a 24-hour time span. While most markets will allow for decent profits regardless of their overall market trend, it seems unlikely anyone can pocket gains of over 50% in quick succession. ABBC Coin is one notable exception in that regard, as it would appear to be doing its own thing at any given time. That is not necessarily a bad thing, at least when one just looks at this market as a way to make a quick buck. Today\u2019s ABBC Coin price momentum is pretty interesting in its own regard. Following another surprising 95% gain in both USD and BTC value alike, one ABBC is now priced at $0.35, or 6,838 Satoshi. Those traders who bought in to increase their BTC holdings will be rather happy with the way things are going today. No one will say no to a 95% increase in BTC holdings for no apparent reason. Cashing out such profits is of the utmost importance before the market sours again. As has been the case during previous ABBC Coin pumps, the most trading volume originates from TOPBTC, BitForex, and LBank. RightBTC also puts up a valiant fight, but it is not keeping up with the top three at this time. Interestingly enough, none of these exchanges are prominent where other cryptocurrencies, tokens, or assets are concerned. None of the major exchanges list ABBC at this time, which is somewhat indicative of what this market is all about in the end. On social media, there is always some information to be found pertaining to current cryptocurrency price trends. ABBC Coin was one of the worst markets just a few days ago, a sit lost nearly 10% in rather quick succession. Such losses are not entirely uncommon when it comes to altcoins with a lower market cap. As such, it is all the more unusual to see this market gain 65% in value today. It is also apparent no other market will be able to keep up with ABBC\u2019s gains today. Not entirely abnormal, as it would appear this market is firing on all cylinders right now. The only market which comes close notes 1/6th of ABBC\u2019s gains. Even so, all of these markets can look very different in a few hours from now. What goes up must eventually come down, and altcoins are no exception in that regard. When looking at the big picture, it will be interesting to see what the future will hold. Now that Bitcoin is trying to overcome its bearish momentum, there is a good chance some altcoins will begin bleeding BTC value again. In the case of ABBC Coin, it would appear its bull run could be coming to an end fairly soon, even though one never knows how this particular market will evolve under these circumstances.

With no real indicative momentum to take note of, markets can easily swing either way without too many problems. The Tron price is still going strong right now, as its gains have remained intact. Other markets were not as successful, but that is somewhat to be expected at this time. When it comes to the individual cryptocurrency markets, they can either follow Bitcoin\u2019s lead by example \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 or do their own thing altogether. Tron seems to fall into the latter category right now, primarily because its gains were in place even when Bitcoin was slightly bearish last night and earlier in the morning. As such, it is all the more impressive to see TRX remain in the green for such an extended period of time, and it seemingly shows no signs of slowing down either. More specifically, the Tron price has gained 6.4% to rise to $0.030205. This level may prove to be rather crucial where this altcoin is concerned, as many traders still expect a push to $0.05 to materialize in the very near future. Combined with a 6.19% increase in TRX/BTC, it would appear things are certainly heading in the right direction. One downside is how TRX hasn\u2019t broken through the 600 Satoshi resistance just yet, but that situation may change at any given time. There are some key developments taking place behind the scenes which may explain this particular uptrend at this time. First of all, the TronLink team released their mobile application. Although the current giveaway will get a lot of attention, for rather obvious reasons, it is another mobile wallet solution for TRX users to enjoy. One can never see enough competition in the cryptocurrency world, primarily because it is all about giving users a choice first and foremost. Secondly, it appears a new trading market for TRX will launch on the CoinTigerEx platform. It would appear Tron will be traded against LTC, ETH, XRP, EOS, XLM, and BTT. A very interesting development for this particular altcoin, primarily because these pairs can offer some rather different form of liquidity. After all, it doesn\u2019t happen all that often one can trade TRX against the likes of EOS, XRP, and XLM, for example. When it comes to memes, most people tend to look toward Dogecoin first and foremost. Tron now also has its own cat-inspired meme, by the look of things. It depicts one rather angry kitty which simply wants Tron first and foremost. Memes make the world go round these days, and it is always good to see more of them come to social media over time. Having a bit of a laugh in the cryptocurrency industry is often undervalued, as one can\u2019t be too serious all the time. Despite all of the positive momentum, one has to wonder how high the TRX price can go in the next few hours and days. Considering how there is always a chance the market will come crashing down if Bitcoin were to slip again, there is always some concern. Assuming Tron can remain above $0.03 for a few days, the push to $0.05 may come to fruition eventually. For now, that seems like a distant dream, but one never knows what the future holds.

While most of the markets do not suffer from too negative pressure right now, it seems that situation may come to change in the very near future. The EOS price is still going strong, which may come as somewhat of a surprise to the masses. When it comes to the cryptocurrency industry, the mid-week is usually a time where things either take shape or fall apart completely. For most markets, the bearish pressure is kicking in pretty quickly, whereas EOS is still going strong. Albeit its gains are rather minimal, it shows the ongoing uptrend still remains in place at this time. Over the past 24 hours, the EOS price gained 2.1% in both USD and BTC value alike. This brings the current price to $5.6, or 0.00107 Bitcoin. Both levels are pretty interesting to keep an eye on, primarily because they have been in play for quite some time now. If this trend continues, EOS may end up as one of the bigger \u201cwinners\u201d of the day compared to other top markets. While some people would have expected the overall crypto trading volume to return to the $25bn level, it seems that will not happen just yet. Over $52bn worth of crypto has changed hands today, and $3.265bn of that volume belongs to EOS. This market keeps trading over half of its market cap in daily volume for some time now, which might help keep the uptrend going for another day. It would also appear the EOS trading pair is now active on the Coinbase Pro platform. There are still a lot of traders unaware of this situation, thus it seems unlikely this platform\u2019s volume will become significant right away. Even so, it seems the sell walls are incredibly thin right now, which is rather unusual for any currency getting listed on a new exchange. For those who keep a close eye on the price chart, it would appear EOS/USDT will become a pretty intriguing market. If another minor gain is noted, a breakout seems very likely toward the $6 level. Sustaining that jump will be incredibly difficult, even under the best of circumstances. Even so, a lot of holders and traders are quite excited about this prospect, for obvious reasons. The big question is whether or not EOS can successfully buck the bearish trend which seems to affect so many different markets right now. So far, so good, but there is always a chance this minute gain is wiped out in very quick succession. As long as Bitcoin remains in the green, EOS will see similar momentum. Having to rely on that market is not necessarily the most appealing ordeal right now. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Bitcoin is still on wobbly legs, but Ethereum isn\u2019t intent on waiting for things to happen. In fact, the Ethereum price appears to be genuinely bullish right now, as the push to $200 is still going strong. It is rather remarkable to see how all of the cryptocurrency markets responded to what appeared to be bearish momentum. A bit of negative price pressure was to be expected today, although it seems no real damage has been done in the process. Ethereum is a key example of how quickly things can turn around, as the market is firing on all cylinders once again. More specifically, the Ethereum price has risen by just over 6% to $178.24. There is also a 4.48% gain in ETH/BTC, as that ratio has reclaimed the 0.0341 BTC level successfully. With over $9.6bn in trades, it seems the demand for ETH will not necessarily slow down either. How that will affect the price, is up in the air. On social media, there are plenty of opinions regarding Bitcoin and the other top markets. Slice of Satoshi wouldn\u2019t short any market right now unless one is absolutely certain the trend will reverse for a decent period. Right now, no signals indicate the markets will stop moving up anytime soon, albeit one never knows what the future will have in store either. Chart watchers try to make sense of what is happening right now, albeit to varying degrees of success. Artoftrading confirms Bitcoin will dictate the pace for alternative markets, including Ethereum. As of right now, it appears BTC will continue to rise in value for a little while, which may bode well for ETH as well. Satish, on the other hand, expects all markets to collapse pretty soon. Traders enjoy looking for recognizable patterns which may help them predict the future and manipulate the markets at the same time. While there are potential correlations between the 2015 chart and the current one, it seems unlikely history will repeat itself so \u201cconveniently\u201d at this time. As is always the rule on cryptocurrency, nothing is ever certain nor should it be taken for granted. Ethereum is clearly in a bullish stage right now but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t suffer some losses when people least expect it. For the time being, a push to $200 seems likely in the days and weeks to come, although a drop below $175 could materialize out of nowhere as well.

The overall trend is still incredibly bullish, but some individual markets are struggling for any real traction. Not entirely surprising, as Sundays are usually very boring in terms of crypto trading. The Ethereum Classic price is going through an unexpected bullish surge right now, which is rather intriguing to keep an eye on. In the world of cryptocurrency and altcoins, Ethereum Classic is not necessarily considered to be a currency worth holding. At the same time, it is one of the few markets which can note gains out of the blue and make traders some good money in the process. Today is another day for making good money with ETC, as the current uptrend is both steep and somewhat promising in terms of long-term momentum. More specifically, the Ethereum Classic price has gained 20% to bring its value to $6.76. There is also a 16.87% improvement in ETC/BTC, as this level has now returned to 0.00131 Bitcoin. Very promising signs for an altcoin which is often overlooked. There is also $888m in trading volume, which is unusually high for ETC. It is even higher than the project\u2019s own market cap, which may be a sign of things to come. There is a very promising development which could warrant the current price increase. A recent meeting among network participants was organized, which aims to introduce a new network upgrade called Atlantis. This hard fork can make a big impact on the Ethereum Classic ecosystem, although there is still a lot of work to be done prior to introducing these particular upgrades. Rallyqt sees now as a good time to effectively point out which version of Ethereum is the real deal and which is the offspring. Although everyone agrees Ethereum Classic forked from Ethereum, this user claims ETC is the original whereas ETH is the actual fork. This dates back to a disagreement over developments within the ecosystem a while ago, which resulted in Ethereum becoming an \u201cadjusted\u201d chain and ETC retaining the original data. Although memes and Ethereum Classic do not go hand-in-hand these days, there is one particular internet meme which can easily apply to all different cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets. Darran McDermott is taken aback by the ETC price momentum, albeit in a positive manner. As such, this meme is certainly applicable where the current momentum is concerned, although it remains to be seen if this price level will still be in place in a few hours from now. When looking at the big picture, Ethereum Classic was one of the underperforming markets this week. Its price level has remained relatively stable, whereas other markets have surged multiple times. The altcoin is now making up for it, although such a steep value increase will usually not remain in place for too long. Even so, today is a good day to make money just like any other, regardless of how one feels toward Ethereum Classic. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

As Bitcoin begins to slip again, most of the top markets are suddenly in the red. Not entirely surprising, although it seems unlikely this momentum will last very long. Until things improve, the Holo price will remain under a fair bit of pressure. It is not entirely abnormal to see altcoins struggle for traction on a Sunday afternoon. In fact, it has become such a common sight, people were almost concerned today wouldn\u2019t offer much of the same. Lo and behold, the markets are dipping in the red again for a little while. Holo is an interesting example in this regard, albeit this market has dipped for several days in a row now. At this time, the Holo price sits at $0.001295, or 25 Satoshi. This represents another 3.54% drop in BTC and USD value alike, and there is a 3% setback in ETH value as well. None of these trends are particularly encouraging, although they are also a continuation of a trend established earlier this week. On social media, it is very difficult to find too much positive talk regarding Holo. That is not abnormal during the weekend either, as people have other things to do than sit on Twitter. HOLO Dude, on the other hand, is still convinced Holo and Holochain both rock regardless of what the price outlook may be. A valuable sentiment, although not too many people will feel this way at this time. Smart Investor shared a screenshot of how the Holo Telegram chat is being run these days. When a channel moderator answers with memes indicating the person asking a genuine question is worthy of a facepalm, a rather hostile tone is set. This is not just a problem affecting Holo either, as most chat groups are operated in a similar manner these days. Not a positive attitude toward potential new investors, though. For those who are looking for some chart action, Minexpert has Holo users covered. This Turkish trader expected the 27 Satoshi level to break either today or in the very near future. The overarching bearish pressure is clearly visible. How low the market will go, is difficult to predict, but a drop to 23 Satoshi is not as unfeasible as some may think. When looking at the bigger picture, it is evident some bearish pressure affects all markets right now. Holo is unfortunate in this regard, primarily because it was already on a downward slope for some time. Even so, these losses are not insurmountable by any means, thus there will undoubtedly be some sort of price action in the hours and days to come.

While his companies may not necessarily be profitable, the products he offers to society are always a topic of discussion. In a recent social media post, Musk confirmed the goal is to make Tesla cars compete with Lyft and Uber to let their owners earn a passive revenue stream. The main reason why this somewhat surprising comment suddenly came to be is due to a disgruntled Tesla user taking to Twitter. Said user was wondering why the camera in his Tesla was \u201coperating\u201d without it being used with Sentry Mode at that time. Given the privacy concerns users have these days, it is evident such a situation can quickly spark a major controversy. Luckily, it seems the purpose of this camera is a lot less worrisome than people may have originally anticipated. As it turns out, this camera will indeed serve a genuine purpose which will benefit Tesla owners all over the world. In due time, Elon Musk\u2018s company will launch its \u201cTesla shared autonomy fleet\u201d. This particular business is set in place to allow this company and its customers to compete with Uber and Lyft in terms of ride sharing. However, it will not necessarily work out in a similar manner, as the car owner won\u2019t even need to be present to partake in this particular business model. As the name somewhat suggests, the \u2018autonomous\u201d part of this car fleet is crucial. It is, in theory, possible for Tesla owners to make money with their card while it makes use of autonomous driving. Although these cars are not equipped to do so at this time, this \u201cswitch\u201d can be flipped pretty quickly. Mush confirmed the software for this specific purpose is being development. It will still require regulatory approval first and foremost, but that bridge will be crossed in due time. As far as the camera\u2019s activity is concerned, it will record video as the autonomous car is driving its ride-sharing passengers to and from locations. This video can then be used to identify potential culprits who did something to the interior of the car and serve as legal evidence in court. It is a slightly different spin on how a cash cam works, but the idea is generally the same, except for looking at the inside of the car, instead of other cars on the road. This revelation is quite intriguing, for many different purposes. The concept of ride-sharing has met a lot of regulatory scrutiny in major countries around the world. By removing the human driver element, things will either get cleared up or become even more complicated as time progresses. Additionally, allowing car owners to make money with the autonomous software offered as part of their vehicle will undoubtedly spark some peculiar debates in the not-so-distant future. While there are still a lot of aspects about this new \u201cfeature\u201d, Musk confirmed more information will be revealed in two weeks from now. It seems this Twitter discussion lifted the veil on something the company had planned to communicate already. Self-driving technology is always interesting to keep an eye on, although it is still in the very early stages of development right now. Tesla is trying to things to a whole new level in this regard, but it remains to be seen if their efforts will be successful.", "date": "2019-04-07T12:30:25+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 7}

Not necessarily because a lot of things happened, but rather because of the Dogecoin price rising significantly. Although an out-of-hand April Fool\u2019s Joke is the main reason for the recent price gains, it seems all of that momentum has come to an end. It is one of the first top markets to show worrisome signs of a trend reversal. For most cryptocurrency enthusiasts, Dogecoin is a bit of an unusual market. Its momentum often makes very little sense compare dot Bitcoin and other top markets. Moreover, there are plenty of people who feel this currency shouldn\u2019t even exist. Even so, there is always some money to be made where DOGE is concerned, which allows this market to thrive under most circumstances. Today, however, the positive momentum has disappeared completely. To put the current DOGE trend into perspective, there is a net 4.5% Dogecoin price loss. As such, one DOGE is now valued at $0.003297, which is still more than respectable. The bigger concern is how DOGE/BTC has lost 6.7% to drop to 64 Satoshi. Those who bought Dogecoin at 51 Satoshi won\u2019t mind this dip too much, yet those who chased the pump earlier in the week will not be too pleased with the way things are going, for rather obvious reasons. On social media, Dogecoin is always an interesting topic to keep an eye on. Jan Hvizdak shares how the DOGE trading volume and price seems to evolve at specific times. When algos are working hard and the humans decide to not intervene too much, the momentum shifts drastically. For now, it seems the bots and algorithms are doing most of the trading once again, although this dip will also make a few human traders rather nervous. In slightly more positive news, it would appear Dogecoin has received a listing on the OOOBTC trading platform. While not a major exchange by any means, it can provide slightly more exposure and liquidity for Dogecoin, which can have an interesting impact on the price. In this day and age, one almost wonders why some exchanges still haven\u2019t listed DOGE, but there are quite a few such platforms out there. The main \u201cculprit\u201d of this downfall is how the Elon Musk joke has gotten out of hand and has now run its course as well. More specifically, the \u201cbig news\u201d was how Elon Musk allegedly became the CEO of Dogecoin, even though that was clearly a joke first and foremost. Even so, plenty of people will have chased this price pump in the process and are now paying the price for their greed. One thing potentially working on Dogecoin\u2019s favor is how this market is a lot more resilient than people give it credit for these days. A dip like this, while not necessarily unexpected, is not something that will disrupt the recently established uptrend. If the losses continue to pile up, that story becomes significantly different. When normal trading resumes tomorrow, DOGE\u2019s value may look very different compared to its current levels. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

So much even that of the top 10 markets, seven of them have dipped in the red fairly quickly. The Cardano price is going down a very slippery slope as of right now, which shouldn\u2019t come as too big of a surprise. It will be interesting to see if these markets can effectively recover some losses pretty soon. Not too many people should be surprised to see the majority of altcoins, tokens, and assets go deep in the red today. While Bitcoin is still holding on to some of its gains, it too will start losing value over the next few hours. However, for alternative markets, those losses are usually compounded, which can trigger an avalanche of price gains or losses. In the case of Cardano, things are not looking good by any means, and it seems unlikely a major improvement will occur anytime soon. To put this momentum in perspective, the Cardano price has lost over 7.1% in quick succession. This drives the US Dollar value of ADA down to $0.083989. In terms of ADA/BTC, things are not looking too great either. A 6.9% decline in that ratio drops ADA to 1,637 Satoshi, with a further drop below 1,600 looking very likely. It is evident all of its \u201ccompetitors\u2019 will struggle as well in the hours to come, but Cardano is clearly leading the pack right now. On social media, the discussions pertaining to Cardano are all over the place. John Investing clearly sees an uptrend for Cardano where its rating in Google Trends is concerned. As has been the case more often than not, an improvement in Google Trends\u2019 searches does not correlate with the price in any meaningful way. As such, it seems unlikely Cardano will become more popular all of a sudden, although nothing is impossible in this industry. VAST is confident now is perhaps the worst time to short Cardano, although the explanation doesn\u2019t make too much sense either. More specifically, claiming ADA is going down in BTC value because \u201cBitcoin is pumping\u201d no longer applies at this time, as Bitcoin is dropping in value just like all other markets. As such, there will be plenty of interesting momentum moving forward, but there is no indication Cardano will reverse course in the coming hours. Those who are merely interested in the ADA price chart may not like what they see either. TG Confirms Cardano hasn\u2019t been looking too great over the past few hours, and it seems a major drop will occur in the very near future. This drop is not necessarily catastrophic, as all markets have seen major gains in very quick succession. Some sort of setback could prove to be crucial in terms of achieving long-term growth for ADA. A lot of the near-term market momentum will hinge on how the Bitcoin price evolves accordingly. Right now, it appears the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency faces a lot of pressure and will struggle for a little while. As far as alternative markets are concerned, they will suffer more of the same momentum, which is only to be expected. Cardano is the biggest value \u201closer\u201d at this time, but it may also rebound a lot quicker compared to other offerings. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While most traders will not be too happy with that particular development, this past week has been unusually bullish as well.

Even so, there is no real indication this downtrend will remain in place for too long, albeit one never knows for sure what the future will bring. As far as the XRP price is concerned, it would appear the current momentum is negative. It is not overly negative either, but there will not necessarily be an uptrend in the near future. With a 2.27% loss in USD value and a 2.73% decrease in XRP/BTC, things are not looking too great. One XRP is currently valued at $0.352358, or 6,816 Satoshi. A drop below 6,800 Satoshi is very likely, especially if Bitcoin were to enter its bearish mode again. On social media, it would appear there is still some optimism as far as the long-term price targets are concerned. TT101 expects a drop to 6,500 Satoshi this week, but in the long run, a major breakout should occur. While that outlook is commendable first and foremost, most traders won\u2019t look beyond the short-term momentum at this time. After all, cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets are designed to make money, not necessarily force users to hold on to them for the long run. For those who take a closer look at the XRP price chart, it seems things are not looking bad nor good. The current resistance level should not be ignored, as it may act as tough support for this popular asset. However, there is also a chance this level will be dumped through pretty quickly, depending on how the overall industry-wide trend evolves. Given the bearish outlook right now, it is not unlikely things will continue along the same path for a little while. Although it doesn\u2019t happen all that often one sees an XRP-related meme being shared on Twitter, Sam seems not too happy with today being another average Monday. This user expected a big XRP run, yet it has not materialized in the end. As such, he still has to work his regular job and continue living life as normal. Even so, it seems unlikely a new all-time high won\u2019t be reached in the near future, but for now, one has to endure this onslaught. For the time being, there is nothing to be overly concerned about as of yet. A bit of bearish pressure was to be expected, albeit some markets will struggle a lot more compared to others, for rather obvious reasons. As far as XRP is concerned, no big drop is to be expected at this time, although the remainder of the day may not necessarily offer too much excitement as of right now.

For the time being, it seems the losses are kept to a bare minimum first and foremost. Even so, the Binance Coin price is trying to regain some of its most recent glory, albeit reaching $20 again might not necessarily happen over the course of the weekend. It is evident a lot of cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets will effectively come under some pressure over the course of the weekend. While it remains to be seen how things will evolve in the coming days, there might not be too much of an overall uptrend during a period when the majority of trading volume tends to dry up. In the case of Binance Coin, this week hasn\u2019t been overly positive by any means, although no major decline has occurred either, in hindsight. As of right now, the Binance Coin price is trying to move up again. Depending on how one wants to look at this chart, it is either very successful or subjected to a very slow start first and foremost. With a 1.15% gain, the price now sits at $19.28. Rising to $20 is the main objective for traders, but it remains to be seen if that is even feasible in the long run. There are also minor gains in BTC and ETH value, although they can be ignored for the most part as well. One worrisome aspect for BNB holders is how some of the pump groups are already cashing out under these circumstances. Bot Invest bought BNB a few hours ago and ha snow cashed out completely with a minor profit. It is evident there is some money to be made through high-frequency trading today, albeit it can also disrupt a few markets along the way. How Binance Coin will be affected by these quick flips, is anyone\u2019s guess at this time. A very remarkable poll was shared by Koinfox today. Its poll asked users about their BNB holdings pertaining to the IEOs offered on Binance Launchpad. The overall sentiment doesn\u2019t look promising where the upcoming IEO is concerned, as a lot of people either consider it \u201cboring\u201d or \u201calready overbought\u201d. If the IEO use case becomes less appealing to Binance Coin holders moving forward, this token may very well see a major decline in price fairly soon. For those who are mainly interested in watching at the Binance Coin chart, there is a very bullish trend visible for everyone to see. CryptoBull expects the value to ping-pong between $17.4 and $23.6. While a drop to $17.4 is not out of the question by any means, a push to $23 or above is a different matter altogether. Even though the current market conditions may appear somewhat promising, it seems unlikely there will be any major price changes in the next few hours and days. It is rather apparent the Binance Coin momentum primarily hinges on Bitcoin\u2019s price at this time. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is seemingly not intent on losing or gaining much value today, which could very well result in a status quo for all other markets. Binance Coin, while usually capable of doing its own thing regardless of the overall sentiment, will prove to be an interesting market to keep an eye on.

This mobile-oriented cryptocurrency project has seen its fair share of success, although some users are turning their back on this entire concept already. The Electroneum price isn\u2019t performing as expected either, by the look of things, which might make ETN slightly less appealing to investors and speculators. Even though this past week has been very bullish for most of the cryptocurrencies on the market, not all projects have benefited from these gains either. More specifically, Electroneum has lost a fair bit of value in the past few weeks. Its downtrend is still in place as of right now, which is a bit surprising, given the overall market trend. Recovering this lost value will prove to be incredibly challenging, but it is far from impossible. To put this in perspective, the Electroneum price lost another 2.47% in the past 24 hours. As such, one ETN is now priced at $0.006049. Not the lowest value, but it seems this ongoing downtrend has made a lot of people antsy. On top of that, there is also a 3.28% drop in ETN/BTC, as that ratio has now plummeted to 121 Satoshi. not promising trends by any means, but there isn\u2019t much to be done about this overall lackluster or negative sentiment toward this altcoin at this time. When looking across social media, it would appear there is plenty of negativity surrounding Electroneum at this point. Btcetnrekt, for example, highlight show it has become significantly cheaper to by 1 million ETN these days While a lower price point could get new investors excited in the process, it seems unlikely most people see it that way. In fact, this user expects a further drop by 50% in the coming months. A rather bleak outlook, although it is somewhat understandable where this is coming from. In terms of the mobile mining app adoption, it seems some users are sharing statistics which paint a worrisome outlook. Ragnar Van Tonderson claims there are just under 89,000 people mining ETN through the iOS and Android apps. If that is indeed the case, there is a severe lack of mass adoption. Some users expected to see 1 million miners in the first 12 months, but it seems unlikely that will be the case at this rate. WALLst vents his frustration and disappointment by claiming how Electroneum is acting like a \u201cshit coin\u201d. It is very difficult to please the cryptocurrency crowd these days, it remains to be seen how this market will evolve in the hours and days to come. Electroneum has surprised many investors and traders in the past year and a half, yet it remains to be seen if such an unexpected uptrend can materialize again in the foreseeable future. For the time being, there isn\u2019t too much promising sentiment as far as Electroneum is concerned. As this ongoing downtrend remains in place, the community is seemingly turning a lot more hostile in the process. When even Bitcoin\u2019s most recent bull run can\u2019t help ETN rise in value, a very interesting albeit unusual situation is created. The overall ETN trading volume is also very low, despite the recent listing on Huobi Global. All of these signs seem to confirm this downward spiral won\u2019t be broken that easily.

It would appear there is plenty of positive market momentum right now, although that can easily evaporate when people least expect it. The Stellar price is still going strong at this time, although its trading volume could use a healthy nudge. It is only normal all of the top alternative markets follow Bitcoin\u2019s trend during these peculiar times. Luckily for traders, the overall momentum is very bullish, which makes for a rather enjoyable week so far. Stellar holders and enthusiasts will be happy with the way things are going, as the push to $0.13 is still in full effect right now. Over the past 24 hours, the Stellar price gained 7.66% to bring its USD value back to $0.126827. There is also a 4.5% gain in XL/BTC as that ratio now sits at 2,540 Satoshi. Traders could not ask for more at this time, other than perhaps an increase in overall volume. Just $442m in trades is not necessarily too great during these times. No one will be surprised most of the XLM-related discussions on social media pertain to the price and where Stellar may be heading next. Nick V expects now is the last time to sell for a while, although it remains to be seen how this chart will pan out. A big leg down wouldn\u2019t be too surprising, but it isn\u2019t too likely either. BenjpTrades wonders if XLM will be capable of breaking out of this downward channel in a successful manner. It is difficult to predict what the weekend will bring, as another rejection at this key level will potentially trigger plenty of bearish pressure in the following days. For now, the uptrend seems in place, but this situation can change at any given time. Last but not least, Bobby Atkins has an interesting view on XLM\u2019s price performance. His trading methods have seemingly paid off in the past few months, although the chart seems to confirm this uptrend may have topped out already. It is evident these gains will be met with a correction of sorts sooner or later, but no one knows exactly when that will be. All things considered, there is no reason to complain about XLM or any other top crypto market right now. The positive trend remains intact, which is rather unusual on a Friday afternoon/evening. As such, the next few days will either offer more of the same, or a completely adverse trend. Either way, there will always be money to be made or lost, regardless of the overall market sentiment.

For a Saturday, there is no real reason to complain about how things are progressing so far. The VeChain price is trying to mount some form of bull run, although it will take a lot more effort to ensure such a trend can materialize. Although most of the cryptocurrency-related discussions usually do not include VeChain, this altcoin and ecosystem should not be overlooked either. It is a project in the market cap top 25, which is an impressive feat in its own right. One issue VET has is how its trading volume is, even on the best of days, incredibly low. As such, there are hardly ever major price swings to get traders excited. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a notable VeChain price increase. Following a 374% gain, the USD value of VET now sits at $0.007675. There is also a 1% gain in VET/BTC, as VeChain is now valued at 149 Satoshi. Both of these trends seem sustainable, even with just $11.78m in overall trading volume. There are some very peculiar developments taking place behind the scenes which could warrant this most recent price change. Kenneth Ashley has successfully registered his own domain through the VeChain Name Service. VeChain is not the only project to offer this type of functionality by any means, but it seems some people see merit in using it, at least. There is also an interesting discussion taking place regarding PlayTable. More specifically, this is expected to become the worlds\u2019 first blockchain gaming console which makes use of VeChainThor. A very interesting concept which can have some major mainstream consequences down the line. When it comes to the actual price chart, it would appear there is some further room for upward momentum over the next few hours. A small retrace might kick in in terms of VET/BTC, but nothing that would drastically upset the overall trend either. CryptoBezos seems to echo a similar sentiment, albeit it will always be uncertain as to how this market will move forward. As is always the case in the cryptocurrency world, VeChain will move along with Bitcoin in either direction. For now, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is doing its job in this regard, although there isn\u2019t any spectacular momentum to speak of either. VeChain may continue its push to $0.008, but it will take a fair bit of effort to get there. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

It would appear some genuine bullish momentum is forming, primarily because Bitcoin is shifting into a higher gear again. Alongside it, the EOS price is noting some big gains in quick succession. A push to $6 isn\u2019t unlikely, but it will not be reached anytime soon. When Bitcoin resumes its promising uptrend, it is usually a matter of time until altcoin markets display notable changes. Earlier this week, some markets went in the red because Bitcoin was gaining value. Today, that is not necessarily the case, although this situation can change at any given moment. For EOS, the current uptrend seems very promising, assuming it can effectively be sustained. To be more specific, the EOS price noted a 5.73% gain to $5.57. There is also a 2.69% increase in EOS/BTC, which may prove to be more interesting ratio to keep an eye on. If EOS were to lose value over Bitcoin, its USD-based gains can be negated fairly quickly as well. So far, everything seems to be heading in the right direction for this market. As is to be expected, this somewhat unexpected uptrend has plenty of holders and speculators excited. SatohsEOS is quite pleased with this most recent uptrend, although a bit of cheerleading will usually not make a market head in the right direction. At least this user isn\u2019t shilling his favorite coin as obscenely as some others. Most of the focus by EOS holders and traders will be on the chart itself. Looking at this chart will always offer some form of insight, although history will not necessarily repeat itself time and time again. For EOS, there is a chance this momentum will continue throughout the weekend, although no major gains are to be expected at this time. A similar sentiment is echoed by Davut Sahinm one of the many Turkish traders who is keeping a close eye on EOS. As promising as things may seem right now, there will be plenty of market pressure to contend with regardless. Depending on how Bitcoin\u2019s chart evolves, EOS may see a lot more unexpected momentum, either for better or worse. Any positive market momentum materializing throughout the weekend is never a long-term price indicator. As such, it remains a bit uncertain where EOS will head next, as any option remains on the table until proven otherwise.

At the same time, it tends to make a lot of people nervous, as they acknowledge this uptrend cannot be sustained indefinitely. At this rate, it seems to be a mere matter of time until the Litecoin price surpasses $100 again. There will be plenty of resistance before this happens, though., It would appear as if Litecoin has suddenly become the talk of the cryptocurrency industry in this week-long bull run. While other markets are gaining value as well it seems LTC does so in a more convincing and prominent manner. That is usually a good sign for Bitcoin and other top altcoins as well, albeit there is always a chance this momentum disappears in the blink of an eye. Over the past 24 hours, the Litecoin price rose by another 6.77% to reach $94.06. In terms of LTC/BTC, there is also an uptrend, albeit the 3.89% change is less significant compared to the net USD gains. With Litecoin slowly approaching the 0.02 BTC level once again, there is seemingly no shortage of bullish momentum at this time. On social media, the Litecoin fans are coming out en masse when the momentum remains this promising. Litecoin Biker, for example, notes how LTC has nearly twice the trading volume of Bitcoin Cash, one of the strongest risers among altcoins today. Even with more trading volume, it remains to be seen if Litecoin can hit $100 in the next few days. Tarun Jain is looking at a slightly bigger picture where Litecoin is concerned. When zooming out on the price chart, it quickly becomes apparent this bull trend has been in place for quite some time now. So far, the past three months have resulted in more than respectable gains, which shows Litecoin is performing better than most other top markets out there. For those enthusiasts who want a shorter time frame as far as the LTC price momentum is concerned, it seems there is nothing to be concerned about either. These past three days have yielded a very bullish uptrend for Litecoin, combined with more than sufficient trading volume to keep traders engaged. While it remains to be seen how long Litecoin can remain as bullish as it is right now, a market reversal seems rather unlikely. A push to $100 seems more plausible, although it will be very difficult to reach that mental level as well.

I was super lucky to be introduced to Blockchain Whispers by one of my colleagues. I thought: \u201coh, it is again one of many signaling channels on Telegram\u201c, but later I discovered that it\u2019s much more than just a source of accurate crypto signals \u2013 free and paid ones. D Man, the leader of Blockchain Whispers is the author of the #1 Amazon Bestseller: Blockchain Decrypted for 2018. It is rated 4.5 out of 5 stars on Amazon, and it is still one of my best crypto investments. How Do I Know They Are Accurate? I was introduced to Blockchain Whispers in September 2018. That was the time when their premium traders (Sicario, Hellfire, and The Circle) demonstrated 15 Bitmex premium signals for free. I didn\u2019t catch the first couple calls but seeing the astonishing accuracy, I joined as soon as they published a new signal. I personally made over +60% profit in just 2 weeks. Out of 15 shared signals in total, 13 ended up in profit, and 2 hit the stop loss, making +282.51% profit. The signals and results are still all transparently shown on their bitmex-position-calculator page \u2013 with all given entries, stop loss prices, take profit prices, leverages, updates and total made profit for each signal, etc. These were all just margin trades. Now you\u2019re probably wondering: \u201cOkay, they are doing good on margin trades, but what about altcoin signals?\u201c Blockchain Whispers Smashes Altcoins Too! In March this year, Blockchain Whispers shared stats of Premium altcoin signals from February 11th to March 19th on their Telegram channel @blockchainwhispersbaby. Out of 7 free altcoin calls, 4 ended up in profit, 3 are pending, and not one call hit the stop loss, making more than +90% profit in total.

Other signals indicate things are not looking all that great. As long as Bitcoin remains in the red, alternative markets will struggle. The Enjin Coin price is an exception, as it is one of the most bullish offerings in the entire top 60. A remarkable turn of events, although escaping the bearish trend will not be easy. It is always surprising to see how the different cryptocurrency markets deal with the overall industry circumstances. Whereas Bitcoin is still struggling to gain some real traction, it seems other markets are moving up in the process. Enjin Coin is one of those markets which seemingly doesn\u2019t care too much about moving alongside Bitcoin, as it is breaking out all of a sudden in quick succession. Sustaining this growth after a major price drop may prove to be very difficult, depending on how the other top markets evolve. Over the past 24 hours, the net balance for ENJ is a 5.58% gain in USD value, a 7.26% gain over Bitcoin, and a 6% gain over Ethereum. All of these signs are incredibly promising for Enjin Coin price watchers, although it seems unlikely this market will escape Bitcoin\u2019s gravitational pull for very long. The $44.2m in trading volume may help move things along rather nicely, though. It is evident this market needed a bit of an upward nudge after the recent downfall. As such, the current value of $0.159947 seems more than fair. Even though most people are looking at Bitcoin first and foremost, it seems the Enjin community is getting excited as well. More specifically, it would appear the recent ENJ-USDT pair on Bittrex is getting a lot of positive attention. Although it may not necessarily introduce a lot of liquidity right away, having a stablecoin pairing is always promising where alternative markets are concerned. It would also seem there are some users who simply enjoy the direct communication provided by the team on Telegram. Communication is often a problem for alternative crypto market teams, yet it seems the Enjin team is doing a good job at this time. Maintaining an open dialog between team members and the community is one way of ensuring the ecosystem can keep on growing. Plus, it also makes ENJ seem more professional compared to a lot of other offerings available today. Lil Vasili & Igor seems to be stirring the pot in terms of the Enjin wallet being pre-installed on the new Samsung Galaxy S10 phones in South Korea. It would appear the pre-installed application will also make its way to the US and Canada in the near future, which will be interesting to keep an eye on. None of these developments will have a notable effect on the ENJ price, although it is a great way of getting more exposure for the project as a whole. As is always where one of the most volatile financial industries is concerned, the current ENJ price trend is not indicative of what will occur throughout the weekend. This minor uptrend is promising, but as long as Bitcoin remains in the red, its potential for future gains will be severely limited. A push to $0.16 seems very plausible, but anything beyond this level will be a struggle first and foremost. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

As far as the Tron price is concerned, the current trend is incredibly bearish first and foremost. Big losses in USD and BTC value alike are making this market seem less appealing by the minute. Overcoming these setbacks is not impossible, though, but it will pose its own set of challenges. Although most people expected something entirely different, a lot of crypto markets are suddenly in bearish mode once again. After several days of promising momentum, things have now come to a head as market corrections begin kicking in pretty quickly. Tron is one of the top markets facing more pressure than others, but that is not entirely surprising either. While the trading volume is more than sufficient to overcome these deficits later today or in the coming days, it is highly doubtful things will improve in the near future. To put the Tron momentum into perspective, there is a 5.8% loss in USD value and a 6.4% decrease in TRX/BTC. Because of this bearish pressure, the current Tron price sits at $0.026269, or 524 Satoshi. There is always a chance this market will drop to 500 Satoshi before a new uptrend emerges, albeit nothing is ever set in stone in this volatile industry. Anything can and possibly will happen at some point. When it comes to the social media sentiment regarding Torn, there are always interesting discussions to keep an eye on. Mr. Dobalina is somewhat convinced over how this project is associated with BTT, which effectively \u201crewards\u201d users to potentially share and upload pirated content. This could prove somewhat problematic for exchanges supporting Tron, although it seems unlikely any of them will undertake any sort of action to change this aspect. Isamalia, on the other hand, is convinced Tron is absolute crap. Its value is so linked to Bitcoin, it is not hard to see where the \u201cbut it\u2019s a market follower\u2019 sentiment comes from. That doesn\u2019t mean Tron is bad by any means, as virtually all markets are linked to Bitcoin in one way or another. Tron is certainly no exception in this regard, albeit it remains to be seen how things will progress over the coming days and weeks. Last but not least, there will be an important update coming to TRONdice. The internal upgrade will result in renewing the game contract and making everything more transparent in the process. It is a change everyone will benefit from, and it seems TRONPoker will launch in the very near future as well. More dApps show the ecosystem is still growing, despite there still being room for more improvements. While the Tron market doesn\u2019t look too appealing right now, it would appear things will improve sooner or later. How that situation will evolve throughout today, is difficult to predict. There is a chance the current momentum is a prelude of what is yet to come, albeit nothing warrants a major price drop either. It all depends on what Bitcoin decides to do, as that market doesn\u2019t look too healthy either as of right now. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While the positive momentum has obviously returned, no one really knows how long this trend can be supported. For now, however, the main focus will be on the Litecoin price, for some. This particular altcoin is noting strong gains again as it attempts to break the $90 resistance once again. It is only normal to see Litecoin benefit from Bitcoin\u2019s renewed surge. Although there is always a chance this trend will reverse over the weekend, there seems to be sufficient momentum behind this price rise to keep things going for a while. Litecoin too notes great trading volume as its price tries to break the next resistance level near $90. Over the past 24 hours, the Litecoin price has noted a strong 6% gain in USD value, pushing the price to $88.3. There is also a smaller 3.08% gain over Bitcoin, as the LTC/BTC ratio returns to 0.0175 Bitcoin. Traders will be rather pleased with the way things are going at this time. primarily because there is plenty of trading volume to go around. On social media, the excitement surrounding Litecoin is also returning, it seems. Crypto Capital Venture is confident Litecoin has a bright future, as there is a halving coming up in four months. Moreover, the vast majority of LTC are already in circulation. A block reward halving can trigger short-term price spikes, but only time will tell whether that will effectively occur this time around. Todor Slavchev shared an interesting musing with the Twitterverse this week. This user is confident Litecoin is better than Bitcoin in every single regard. As such, he also offers a moment of silence for Bitcoin Maximalists who never bothered to look at LTC to date. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but it seems unlikely Litecoin will overtake Bitcoin anytime soon if ever. Trader Bahs, on the other hand, is simply looking for ways to make as much money as possible. Longing Litecoin, XRP, and EOS has proven to be a successful trade so far, even though any market could have yielded some degree of gains compared to 24 hours ago. The big question is when traders will begin shorting en masse again, as that seems to be a matter of time. When looking at the big picture, it would appear Litecoin\u2019s uptrend only occurs because Bitcoin is rising in value. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is evident the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is under tremendous pressure to perform right now. This coming weekend will prove to be incredibly interesting, either for better or worse. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

The XRP price is an interesting example in this regard. It is the only top three market in the green right now, primarily because of a healthy increase where the XRP/BTC ratio is concerned. This momentum will please a lot of holders and traders, albeit its longevity remains rather uncertain, for the time being. It is not entirely abnormal to see XRP perform rather well when Bitcoin comes under a fair bit of pressure. Over the past two years or so, the price chart of XRP and BTC seemed inversely correlated, albeit they do tend to follow similar patterns every now and then as well. Today proves how these markets can head in opposite directions at a crucial time. XRP is moving up swiftly across the board, whereas Bitcoin is somewhat struggling for momentum as of right now. To put this in perspective, the XRP price has gained 4.8% to rise to $0.363051. The bigger story is how there is a net 6.52% gain in XRP/BTC, which brings that ratio back to 7,324 Satoshi. It has been a while since XRP rose above 7,300 Satoshi, as this ratio has been subjected to an ongoing downtrend for several weeks now. Why the situation is suddenly turning around, remains a bit unclear. Traders and holders will not complain, though, as it is the bullish sign they have been looking for. On social media, there is always at least one rumor which will trigger a lot of attention. Bull Run Wonka claims XRP will become the official currency of Venezuela. There is no evidence to back up these claims, nor is there any real reason to expect any evidence to materialize. Venezuela has its own cryptocurrency and it would be rather odd to see XRP make any meaningful impact in this country moving forward. David Clough is trying to make sense of this current trend. That is very difficult to achieve, as it seems this uptrend has materialized seemingly out of the blue. While it is possible a minor bull run is taking shape, it will primarily depend on how dire things get where Bitcoin is concerned. For the time being, traders need to take the gains when they materialize and remain patient when the momentum shifts again. Dutch xrPal is seemingly one of the least patient XRP holders and traders on Twitter today. It is certainly true XRP has tried to break an upside resistance level three times and failed miserably every single time. With a fourth attempt now being launched the coming weekend may prove to be rather interesting where this market is concerned. However, making any accurate predictions at this time is pretty much impossible. While the current XRP momentum may get some people excited first and foremost, it remains unclear how long this market can buck Bitcoin\u2019s negative trend. The gains in XRP/BTC are very promising in that regard, although it seems unlikely the $0.37 level will be reached in the very near future. Even so, it seems this market is in rather good shape, which may come as a surprise to plenty of enthusiasts and traders. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

As far as the current trend is concerned, it was a mere matter of time until the momentum soured. All markets are getting battered right now, with the Litecoin price losing nearly 12% in very quick succession. Turning this ship around will prove rather difficult. A lot of cryptocurrency traders keep a small amount of Litecoin as part of their portfolio. In this volatile industry, diversification is key at all times. Although the Litecoin value surpassed $90 earlier in the week, it has now dropped down to $83 again. This sharp correction was somewhat to be expected, albeit it may not necessarily remain in place for very long. The Litecoin price is currently subjected to a near 12% decline in USD value and a 6.8% loss in BTC value. As such, one LTC is priced at $83, or 0017 Bitcoin. Both of these levels are still more than significant, primarily because one LTC was valued a lot lower when the year 2019 came around. It is always pertinent to keep the bigger picture in mind when it comes to cryptocurrencies as a whole or on an individual basis. On social media, there is never a shortage of interesting discussions pertaining to cryptocurrencies. JohnKimoOfficial sees a clear Litecoin uptrend over the past few months. It is certainly true the current value is still a near 300% increase compared to January 1st, thus it seems there is no reason to panic by any means. Plenty of LTC price charts can be found on Twitter right now, although most of them offer some conflicting information. Dan C expects this retrace to continue all the way down to $72 or potentially even lower. That seems a bit steep, although it will primarily depend on what happens to Bitcoin over the coming hours and days. It would seem Crypto Eraser has a completely different opinion as to where LTC will be heading next. There is some solid support in place above $80, and there is no volume nor wick to speak of at this time. That doesn\u2019t mean the downtrend won\u2019t be extended, but for now, it seems the hourly candles are showing bullish signals again. When looking at the bigger picture, all of the top markets still hold on to their gains accumulated in the past few days. Some of those profits are no longer in play, but the overall trend remains intact, for the time being. There is a genuine chance all markets will rebound in the coming days, albeit that will primarily depend on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum.

Some of the top markets are already dipping in the red, which usually doesn\u2019t bode too well for alternative offerings. As some markets struggle, others will continue to soar. The KuCoin Shares price, however, is getting battered on an hourly basis at this point. Some of the top cryptocurrency exchanges have issued their own tokens or asset in recent years. Binance Coin gets most of the attention, although KuCoin Shares has also garnered a strong following. Its current price trend, however, is rather bleak, as this market notes the biggest losses in the entire market cap top 50. The current value doesn\u2019t accurately reflect some of the developments taking place behind the scenes. The big question is whether or not those changes will impact KCS\u2019s value in a positive manner. Following a net 20% loss in USD value and a 21% decrease over Bitcoin, it seems the KuCoin Shares price is on the retrace. While it is still valued at $1.66, this slippery slope seems to indicate that value may not be in play for much longer. There is also an 18.3% decrease in KCS/ETH, which only adds more pressure to this market. It is a bit unclear why KCS is facing so much pressure across the board, although it is possible other markets will go through a similar stage fairly soon. In terms of ecosystem developments, the KuCoin team made a key announcement this week. The parent company will begin implementing a KCS buyback, which can have a positive impact on the price. All of the purchased KCS will be burnt and removed from circulation. It is not the first time this process takes place, as five other buybacks have occurred over the years. How this affects the KuCoin Shares value once the buyback occurs, remains to be determined. Overcoming the current losses won\u2019t be easy. In other somewhat positive news, KuCoin has also begun its spotlight token sales recently. The first project has seemingly sold out in less than an hour, which is very impressive. It seems this platform operates similar to Binance\u2019s Launchpad, as partaking in these token sales can only be done through KCS. Even so, the big interest in this token sale has seemingly caused the KuCoin Shares value to plummet. Not necessarily what traders and speculators had hoped for at this point. It would also appear there are simply a lot of people who prefer using the KuCoin exchange over some other trading platforms. That is only normal, as it leads to further decentralization. If everyone used one and the same trading platform \u2013 as in, a centralized one \u2013 things would get rather troublesome for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. However, it seems most of these comments have to do with an ongoing KCS giveaway on Twitter, which may skew the picture a bit. Although the current KCS market conditions are far from appealing to most, this dip also creates a buying opportunity for those who are willing to take a big gamble. All of the markets are still very unpredictable and volatile at this point. Depending on how Bitcoin\u2019s situation evolves over the coming hours and days, the KCS chart may head in an interesting direction. Only time will tell if that is for better or worse.

Cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets are no different in this regard. A fair few markets are under pressure right now, as the XRP price trend clearly illustrates. How all of this will play out in the hours to come, remains difficult to predict at this time. When all of the crypto markets turned bullish, there was some concern as to how long the uptrend would last. As this momentum seemed to continue unabated, signs of FOMO became visible across the different markets. Fast forward to today, and it appears a big correction is kicking in for all tokens, assets, and currencies. XRP is currently bleeding value all over the place, despite noting a more than impressive amount of trading volume. This will either be a very short dip or a massive market reversal Over the past 24 hours, the XRP price has lost 1.7% in USD value, pushing it down to $0.344278. There is also \u2013 yet another \u2013 3.39% loss in XRP/USD, as that ratio is now approaching the 6,800 Satoshi level. Ripple\u2019s native asset has been under tremendous pressure in the BTC department for quite some time now. It does not appear any major uptrend will materialize in that regard, although no one really knows why. It seems the higher trading volume isn\u2019t helping matters much either at this time. On social media, Tommygun asks the question which is only everyone\u2019s mind at this time. Is this the end of the bull run, or will the positive momentum return later this week? It seems the opinions regarding this matter are all over the place, as no one has been able to make sense of this most recent price surge either. Bitcoin remains in the green, for now, but it too is facing some pressure on the hourly chart. A very interesting second half of the week lies ahead in this regard. XRP to the M confirms a lot of people had doubts regarding this week\u2019s gain. Some media outlets even referred to it as a possible April Fool\u2019s Joke, even though that would have lasted for three days and involved several dozen billions of dollars. Now that the markets show signs of reversing course, it would appear there may be some merit to the April Fool\u2019s debate after all. This user also expects to see XRP hit $1 at some point, but the current trend won\u2019t necessarily allow for that to happen. For those who are not too obsessed with price charts, the overall trading volume of XRP provides a remarkable statistic. According to XRP Bella, it is the first time the asset has noted such high trading volume since early 2018. Although that period was subjected to a lot of bearish pressure, it did indeed yield higher trading volumes for most markets compared to the 12-month period following it. Trading volume alone doesn\u2019t make for a bullish market, though, that much is rather obvious at this point. For the time being, it is still too early to draw any real conclusions as to where the markets are heading next. A correction of sorts would kick in eventually, as it is healthy for markets to reset themselves after an extensive bull run. How low the price will drop in the process, however, is a different matter altogether. This current dip might be a prelude of what is yet to come, albeit nothing is ever set in stone in this volatile industry. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Similar to some other markets, the Dogecoin price has turned incredibly bullish in rather quick succession. Sustaining this level of growth is always difficult, but Dogecoin wouldn\u2019t be Dogecoin without some surprising momentum. As was somewhat to be expected when it comes to the alternative markets, sustaining any real gains is not all that easy when Bitcoin rises in value. Most markets tend to lose BTC value, which can easily negate some of the USD-based gains in the process. As far as Dogecoin is concerned, it would appear things are not looking all that bad after all. It has taken a while for this momentum to materialize, but things are looking up for the meme currency of the internet. Over the past 24 hours, the Dogecoin price has risen by 30.8% in USD value and 26% in TBC value. Following these surprisingly big gains, one DOGE is now priced at $0.003323, or 67 Satoshi. Especially this latter aspect will please a lot of holders and traders, primarily because there haven\u2019t been any notable DOGE/BTC gains in the months prior to this uptrend. A very interesting turn of events at this time, albeit this momentum can remain in place for some time. It is evident this most recent Dogecoin surge has made plenty of people good money in the process. Gaza Boss, for example, has made a lot of money in the past week of buying Dogecoin, which shows this market should never be overlooked by any means. Dogecoin isn\u2019t the most appealing market among traders, which also explains why its trading volume still sits below $90m right now. That is not necessarily a problem, but it can be a bit bothersome further down the line. The recent April Fool\u2019s Joke claiming how Elon Musk decided to become the CEO of Dogecoin got a surprising amount of good attention. It is evident this was clearly a joke first and foremost, although many people see it as the catalyst which sent DOGE in an upward spiral. While Elon Musk seemingly likes Dogecoin, it is rather unlikely he will ever actively get involved in this cryptocurrency. The big question is how long the DOGE price can remain at this level, and if so, where it will head next. Me Harkness isn\u2019t too convinced there is much to get excited about, as the downtrend line still hasn\u2019t been broken in a convincing manner. However, there is a chance things will continue to improve from here on out, which would effectively make DOGE a bull market like Bitcoin and others. The coming days will offer more clarity on this front, as a lot of unknown factors remain in play at this time. All of the current market signs seem to indicate Dogecoin\u2019s price run is far from over. The lack of real trading volume is still problematic, primarily because the current figures may not be sufficient to keep things going for much longer. Compared to other markets DOGE generates far less trading volume than it should, which can have a negative effect on the price as well. However, as long as Bitcoin remains bullish, Dogecoin will most likely see very similar momentum. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Nothing is ever set in stone in this odd industry. Despite some promising markets moving up all around it, the BitTorrent Token price simply isn\u2019t budging. A peculiar trend, although it is part of the expected multi-month bear market which keeps eroding all buy support. Despite all of the fanfare associated with the initial sale and trading of BitTorrent Token, it is safe to say the project has not evolved as expected. The lack of technical use cases for this token makes it a speculative offering first and foremost. This is also reflected in the price department, as the USD value remains flat, whereas its TRX and BTC value continues to plummet day by day. Slowly but surely, this token\u2019s buy support is being eroded, and there is no real improvement in sight. Over the past 24 hours, the BitTorrent Token price gained 1.29% to push the value to $0.000803. Not exactly an improvement compared to several weeks ago, even though all of the alternative markets are showing plenty of bullish USD momentum. What is worrisome is how BTT has now dropped to 16 Satoshi or 0.02917 TRX. Neither level will please holders all that much, as there is little to no buy support if BTT drops below 14 Satoshi. Social media is never a good place to find any financial trading advice. That doesn\u2019t prevent individuals from trying to do so regardless, though. Rsconversions would like people to stop investing in BTT because it is a \u201crubbish coin\u201d. There is an argument to be made there, although it seems unlikely anyone will follow this advice blindly. It certainly is one of the more disappointing markets at this time, but \u201crubbish\u201d seems a bit of a stretch. There is also some growing dismay regarding Justin Sun and the unkept promises regarding BitTorrent Token. Despite announcing a product launch of Q1 2019, that deadline has now passed without much of an update. As such, it seems normal this market will continue this downward trend for quite some to come, unless something changes to make this token more appealing to the masses. For now, the status quo will undoubtedly remain in place, albeit that is not necessarily a good thing. For those merely interested in the price chart, the opinions are a bit all over the place. Crypto Expert still expects a breakout, even though there are absolutely no signs or indicators that will happen whatsoever. Even if Bitcoin were to remain bullish, it seems rather unlikely anything big will happen for BitTorrent Token because of this trend. BTT Simply is not pulling its weight at this time. When looking at the bigger picture, the term \u201cunderperforming\u201d comes to mind when looking at the BitTorrent Token trend. While there is no reason to note any real gains either, it quickly becomes evident things will not necessarily improve in the near future either. For early investors and bag holders, that is not the development they have been looking for by any means. For now, the momentum will need to be endured first and foremost, but there is little reason to expect any real improvements moving forward. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While its gains are nothing to sneeze at by any means, it is evident some of its market cap range \u201ccompetitors\u2019 are having more success. A lot of people are genuinely wondering how long this Bitcoin momentum can remain in place. With a near 26% gain in the past few days, it is evident this bull run has grown well beyond proportions. That is not necessarily a bad thing by any means, but it will be intriguing to see how all markets respond to this challenge over the coming days and weeks. As far as the EOS price is concerned, the current uptrend isn\u2019t half bad, but not overly impressive either. A 15% rise in USD value means one EOS is priced at $5.47. There is also a 6.15% gain in EOS/BTC, bringing that ratio to 0.00106 BTC again. Both trends are more than acceptable, but they are far less significant compared to Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and several other markets. Changing that scenario will not be all that easy. On social media, there have always been some very interesting discussions pertaining to EOS. C4Chaos, for example, is wondering why anyone would use either XRP or Bitcoin Cash, in terms of sending transactions with a fee when EOS can do it without additional costs. An interesting sentiment, albeit there is a case to be made for using most of the top currencies, tokens, and assets for regular transactions these days. When it comes to the current dApp ecosystem, there has been significant growth for both EOS and Tron these days. Of the top applications, half of them belong to the EOS ecosystem, which is rather intriguing. It is evident there will be some fierce competition with Tron in this department. Even so, there is no sign of Ethereum-based dApps in the top 10 right now, which is rather telling. There is also some growing dismay regarding Coinbase\u2019s reluctance to enable EOS trading at this time. Although that is not too surprising by any means, one has to keep in mind the company will keep adding more offerings as time progresses. Whether or not EOS will ever be officially supported, is difficult to predict. Logic would say that will be the case, but cryptocurrency is not always a rational industry. When looking at the bigger picture, it is obvious this EOS bull run will fall apart of Bitcoin reverses course. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has shown no signs of doing so, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen in the near future. This massive industry-wide uptrend will be met with a correction of sorts sooner or later. When that will happen, all markets need to buckle up to prepare for the worst.

A lot of people claim how no bull market can be established until the \u201cbig three\u2019 are all moving up in a decisive manner. So far, it seems as if the Ethereum price is fulfilling that task alongside Bitcoin and XRP. Its gains are not as impressive as some other markets, but the overall trend appears to be in place in a somewhat convincing manner. It is evident all of the top cryptocurrency markets need to move up in quick succession in order to ensure an uptrend is effectively materializing. While Bitcoin seems to be leading the dance without any real problems, there was some concern as to why Ethereum wasn\u2019t moving up alongside it earlier this week. Many different factors could be at play in that regard, yet it appears things are starting to look up again. Some solid gains have been noted in the process, and things are looking promising once again. To put this in perspective, the Ethereum price has noted an 11.3% gain in USD value to push the price to $167.72. There is also a solid gain in ETH/BTC, as the 4.92% improvement shows there is some life left in this particular market. With a current value of 0.03385514 Bitcoin, a lot of holders and traders will be pleased with the way things are going. Combined with $10.747bn in trading volume \u2013 which is absolutely insane \u2013 there may be some further momentum in the very near future. As one would come to expect, the discussions on social media mainly pertain to cryptocurrency prices right now. An interesting trend has become apparent where Ethereum is concerned. According to Pankaj Balani, a lot of margin traders are getting liquidated on BitMEX, primarily because they were shorting ETH in the process. This is a very positive trend first and foremost, although it pales in comparison to the Bitcoin-related liquidations. With this uptrend in place once again, it is only normal some miners are firing up their GPU farms again. Although there is a chance this uptrend is just temporary, there may be some bearish pressure moving forward. How that will affect the Ethereum mining operations in people\u2019s homes, remains to be seen. Without a certain value to at least break even, few people will be interesting to keep unprofitable mining operations going for an extended period of time. For those who merely want a snapshot of the ETH price chart, Byzantine General has people covered. It is evident this decisive breakout is very promising, although there may be another downturn in the very near future. No markets can keep rising in value indefinitely, not even when the trading volume is spiking across all markets. As promising as any uptrend may look right now, there is a lot of genuine concern as to how things will pan out in the next few days and weeks. When looking at the bigger picture, all of these market gains stand or fall with Bitcoin. As the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency continues to move up ever so slightly, there is no real concern as of yet. However, surpassing $5,000 and turning it into a stable support level will be a monumental challenge. Everyone wants to see a return to $19,000 pretty soon, but there is no reason to expect any miracles at this time. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Not all of these creations will gain mainstream traction despite having some solid or unique ideas. The launch of Onederx, which has seemingly gone by unnoticed, is well worth paying attention to. It is the only platform to officially allow users to trade memes. Always conduct your own research prior to trusting these platforms with money. People who are familiar with the various cryptocurrencies on the market will acknowledge memes have begun playing an increasing role of importance. Dogecoin is one of the greatest examples in this regard. It was created as the meme currency of the internet and still holds true to that image in 2019. Other coins have seen their fair share of memes as well, either for better or worse. It is only normal some sort of \u201cmarket\u201d is established for this specific purpose. According to the team at OneDerx, there is a genuine demand for trading memes. To ensure this is made possible, they apparently created a composite meme-index. This index is, as the name suggests, composed of memes which will create a different type of futures trading market. Users who are willing to take a gamble with their Bitcoins can forecast meme trends and make real money by doing so. It will always be a niche project and market first and foremost, yet the idea is viable in its own regard. It is important to note users will not be trading individual memes. Instead, the Meme-index tracks the activity of all leading meme communities in real time. With the current bullish trend in place for all of the markets, there is a genuine chance the use of memes will drastically increase in the weeks to come. As such, this Meme-index can be quite interesting to keep an eye on, as it has seen its fair share of fluctuations already. The trading of the Meme-index occurs through perpetual contracts. Most traders will be familiar with this concept, as it is used by some of the leading trading platforms in the cryptocurrency industry. Known as MEMES-BTC, it is a \u201cfunctional trading tool\u201d that lets users benefit from leverage, shorting, and withdrawing profit like they would normally. Although this may be a bit confusing to new users, the trading vehicle itself seems to be well-suited for this type of business activity. A lot of people might be wondering how this Meme-Index is weighed at all times. It appears a very simple process is used, although one that may also raise a lot of questions. The Onederx team scans the memes thread on Reddit, of which the top 25 memes are extracted. By adding up the number of votes, the index value will be calculated and adjusted every 20 seconds. A very interesting way of handling this process, although there will always be some concerns as to whether or not this approach can actually work. As is usually the case when new projects like these are launched, one has to wonder how long OneDerx will stick around for. As novel as the service may seem on the surface, there is always a chance this project will disappear due to a lack of interest or other reasons. It is pertinent interested parties conduct their own research prior to contributing money to a project like this. The team hopes to be taken seriously, although it remains to be seen how things will evolve in the months and years to come. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While it remains to be seen which markets will effectively move up or down, the Tron price appears to be in a good place at this time. Solid gains in USD value are always a positive sign, although the TRX/BTC ratio is facing a fair bit of pressure due to Bitcoin\u2019s own uptrend. It is not uncommon to see individual cryptocurrencies, assets, or tokens note a 10% gain when looking across the charts. Tron is no exception in that regard, although it is evident there will be a correction sooner or later. With the current uptrend locked in place, many people expect TRX to hit $0.03 at some point this week. Not impossible, but it would require another 15% gain in order to make that happen. Realizing that potential will mainly depend on what happens to Bitcoin for the foreseeable future. To put everything into perspective, it would appear the Tron price has gained 11.2% to bring its USD value to $0.026217. On the TRX/BTC front, however, things are not looking that great. A bet 2% loss is not entirely abnormal when Bitcoin turns bullish. In fact, most altcoins will struggle in the BTC department when the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency resumes its bullish trend. For now, the 560 Satoshi level should hold true for TRX, but it is possible a further decline will kick in later today. Even though the Tron ecosystem keeps growing, not all of its dApps should be trusted. CryptoRob isn\u2019t too amused with the Tron Village dApp, which has seemingly taken his money and bailed. Although it remains to be seen if there is a logical explanation for turn of events, he expects to be out of 11,200 TRX. That represents nearly $300 at the current price. While this may seem insignificant to some, it is evident such dApp experiences can cause serious problems for the associated currency. In more positive news, it would appear CryptoCompare has now officially introduced support for TRXMarket. While this will not have an impact on the price whatsoever, the TRXMarket is an important decentralized marketplace solution to promote the Tron project as a whole. Gaining such recognition at an early stage is a major step forward, although there is still a lot of work to be done regardless. CryptoNelly, who initially wasn\u2019t a big fan of Tron by any means, has now seemingly appreciated what the community is doing. Its dApps are seemingly straightforward to use, which can help put Tron on the map as a whole. The big question is whether or not other blockchain and dApp ecosystems will experience similar growth and appreciation over time. There are still a lot of hurdles to overcome for Tron and other projects prior to dApps becoming mainstream, though. As long as Bitcoin remains this bullish, it is likely Tron and other markets will note similar momentum moving forward. However, the Bitcoin will undergo a price correction sooner or later, which can spell trouble for the altcoins, tokens, and digital assets on the market. As far as TRX is concerned, the USD value should remain above $0.026 without too many problems. The pressure on TRX/BTC, however, will not necessarily relent all that soon.

The uptrend is still in place as of right now, and it seems most markets continue to move up accordingly. Even the Holo price has successfully noted big gains, although its BTC and ETH ratio is plummeting pretty hard. Most traders remain hopeful this is the beginning of much bigger things to come. The past week and a half haven\u2019t been too great for fans of Holo. Not because the currency is a dead project all of a sudden, as that appears to be far from the case. However, the value of HOT has seen its fair share of bearish pressure, up until two days ago. As such, these past 24 hours have yielded a lot of opportunistic momentum which very few people expected to witness. Over the past 24 hours, the Holo price has gained 7.5% to rise to $0.00124. In terms of BTC and ETH ratio, however, the losses are quite steep with 5.66% and 3.3% respectively. Although traders had hoped for a push to 40 Satoshi again, the HOT value sits at 26 right now. It is likely this ratio will continue to decrease over the next few days. There is one tidbit of rather interesting news for Holo which would warrant a further price increase. BiteBTC has confirmed they will be listing HOT as of today. Although it is not the biggest exchange by any means, one has to keep in mind any form of additional liquidity will be beneficial to this altcoin. As such, it may warrant another minor price push, yet it is unclear how much of a difference this listing will make when everything is said and done. XRPSteve makes a rather interesting point at this time. This most recent Bitcoin price rise \u2013 as well as the value increase of altcoins, tokens, and assets \u2013 has caused a major mood shift to occur all of a sudden. This is the enthusiasm most people expect to see all year round. Following an 18-month bearish trend, however, it is only normal the mood is a bit sour first and foremost. For those who merely care about the price chart and where the HOT value is heading next, Escobar has some intriguing thoughts. He claims Holo is one of the new shiny coins on the block which will see a major pump similar to the levels attained throughout 2017. It is a very optimistic outlook, although it may very well come true in the long run. Any market will benefit from Bitcoin\u2019s momentum, which is only to be expected. When looking across the board, one has to wonder how long all of this momentum can be sustained under these circumstances. As long as Bitcoin remains in the green, it seems unlikely any form of correction will occur. However, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has been very unpredictable since its inception.

More and more markets are moving in the double-digit percentage gains range, which is rather promising. When even the EOS price can gain over 10% in quick succession, it would appear the overall interest in these different markets is still growing in a swift manner. When Bitcoin turns uber bullish as it has in the past 16 hours, there is always a genuine concern as to how long such gains can be sustained. If the previous attempts at an uptrend are any indication, this round could prove to be rather short-lived first and foremost. However, Bitcoin shows so signs of slowing down just yet, nor do the alternative markets at this time. EOS, for example, is moving up strongly and swiftly, which has a lot of people excited for obvious reasons. As of right now, the EOS price has gained over 10% to rise to $4.61. It is not the highest value this market has seen today, as there appears to be some negative price pressure in play as well. This is most apparent where EOS/BTC is concerned, as that ratio doesn\u2019t look too promising as of right now. More specifically, the altcoin lost nearly 5% over Bitcoin, pushing the ratio down to 96,547 Satoshi. Not abnormal, as the massive Bitcoin price rush usually doesn\u2019t bode well for altcoins. In terms of future ecosystem growth, there is a good chance EOS will get a lot more positive attention moving forward. EOS New York discusses Eclipse, which is an automatic resource management solution for EOS dApps. It allows for scaling dApps automatically without having to be concerned about resource management. Some of the bigger dApps already make use of this solution as of right now. An interesting way of addressing some key concerns. For those who are mainly interested in the EOS chart, it seems there is a lot of momentum brewing. Although there is a visible dip in the past few hours, it may prove difficult to break this uptrend. That will mainly depend on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum and which direction it decides to head in over the coming hours and days. It is evident this steep upward trend can never be sustained without a correction to kick in sooner or later. There is also a strong belief all of the markets will transition into semi-permanent bull markets fairly soon. That will only happen if and when Ethereum decides to join the fray. While ETH does not some gains as well, it seems to be well behind the curve as far as Bitcoin and most top altcoins are concerned. Even so, traders should enjoy this current momentum while it lasts, as there is a good chance it may not last all that long. Although the EOS/BTC trend doesn\u2019t look too promising, it would appear the USD value is still going strong. That is all one can ask for when Bitcoin engages its own pumps, as that currency will always lead the dance first and foremost. For now, it seems EOS will continue its uptrend in terms of USD value, although there will be some further losses in the Satoshi range to compensate this bull trend.

Not because it isn\u2019t noting any gains, but its deficit in BTC value is slowly eroding some of the USD-based XRP price gains. As such, there is still an uptrend to speak of, albeit traders are not too happy about the XRP/BTC ratio, for obvious reasons. For those traders and enthusiasts who look at the bigger picture, it becomes apparent XRP\u2019s price trend is not entirely abnormal. Most of the non-Bitcoin markets note strong USD gains, yet lose value over Bitcoin itself. Although some markets have smaller BTC-based losses compared to others, it would appear XRP is a bit of a different creature. It is one of the few markets whose BTC-based losses are bigger than the USD-based gains. To put this in perspective, the XRP price has gained 6.5% to bring the value to $0.332242. However, in XRP/BTC terms, it seems a 7.75% loss has materialized over the past 24 hours. It has to be said how XRP has been in a downward spiral where this ratio is concerned, but this level of downtrend is rather worrisome. It is also the first time in a whole one XRP is valued at less than 7,000 Satoshi. This is not something most traders will be happy with. Despite this slightly worrisome trend, it would appear the community isn\u2019t overly concerned at this point. Matt Humphrey is quite pleased with the current gains in USD value, as it marks one of the bigger movements in quite some time. However, there is always a chance things will turn around, either for better or worse, in the very near future. As far as XRP is concerned, it seems the uptrend can be resumed, although the losses over Bitcoin will not be negated so quickly. Hamza, on the other hand, simply likes to support XRP because this user expects big things from this particular ecosystem. The interesting aspect is how this user also doesn\u2019t own a significant amount of XRP either, which is a bit different from most XRP \u201cshills\u201d to be found on the internet these days. It almost seems as if anyone who supports a specific cryptocurrency, token, or asset has to be a bag holder, even though that is far from the case. Nico, who likes to take a closer look at the current market trends, is quite pleased with how XRP is evolving. Not in terms of XRP/BTC, although this current low value may very well present an interesting buying opportunity to look into. After all, it has been a while since XRP dropped below 7,000 Satoshi. It remains to be seen if the market can recover, though, as that may prove difficult as long as Bitcoin remains as bullish as it is today. When looking at the bigger picture, it is evident the Bitcoin uptrend is causing all alternative markets to lose value in BTC terms. As long as those losses do not override any USD-based gains, there is nothing to be overly concerned about. In the case of XRP, the current downtrend is somewhat problematic, but it seems unlikely the USD value will go in the red anytime soon. How high it can go, is difficult to predict, as $0.33 needs to be turned into a support level first. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Bitcoin has seemingly shifted into a higher gear and the rest of the markets do their best to catch up. The Litecoin price is one of the strongest risers in the altcoin segment, as its value will seemingly hit $70 without too many problems. That is, assuming Bitcoin doesn\u2019t fall apart in the hours to come. When Bitcoin started pumping out of the blue, it quickly became apparent there would be some interesting market momentum for alternative markets as well. It now seems that is effectively what traders have gotten, although a lot of markets are still under bearish pressure. Litecoin is a notable exception in this regard, as it has effectively gained value without too many problems. The one downside is how LTC/BTC isn\u2019t looking too healthy, but that is to be expected. Over the past 24 hours, the Litecoin price has gained 10.2% in USD value to push the price near $67. There is also the 2.7% loss in LTC/BTC, which is not necessarily a good sign. When keeping the bigger picture in mind, it would appear there may be some further pressure in that department over the hours to come. It is very difficult for altcoins to note gains in BTC value when the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency turns bullish. Litecoin will face some struggles to hang on to the 0.01432 BTC level throughout today. On social media, Litecoin is an actively discussed topic, although mainly for price chart purposes. Matt, for example, expects LTC/USD to keep improving throughout the day as the recent bull flag has been topped. As such, there is a chance this momentum will remain in place, and a push to $70 wouldn\u2019t seem impossible by any means. However, depending on what happens to LTC/BTC, things could get a bit more interesting. A massive drop in that ratio can easily negate USD gains for Litecoin. A slightly different sentiment is shared by Keshav R Narla. This user sees a major uptrend across all cryptocurrency markets, which seems to signal a major bull run could materialize for all markets in the coming months. Claiming how all cryptocurrencies are \u201cout of the downtrend\u201d, may be a bit premature, as there is still a chance this is an April Fool\u2019s prank pulled by some big whales who want to manipulate the markets. Plebonacci, on the other hand, would like to point out how bullish Litecoin momentum can usually bode well for other altcoins, assets, and tokens on the market. This Litecoin uptrend has been in place for quite some time, when looking at a slightly bigger picture, which seems to indicate there is something intriguing happening behind the scenes. However, there are never any guarantees in the cryptocurrency world, as everything is always subject to change. It is evident today\u2019s major uptrend across all top markets will heavily rely on what happens to Bitcoin in the coming hours. As the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency will probably be unable to sustain this growth for more than a few hours, it is only normal to expect other markets to go through a similar trend. The coming hours will be pretty crucial for many different reasons, although it is unclear what will happen in the next few days. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Working with a venture capital firm, Matthew Ledvina has a strong focus on technology-based investments. Blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies, is beginning to revolutionise the venture capital landscape, opening up new opportunities for backing start-ups on a global scale. Initial coin offerings are increasingly being used by blockchain projects both in the early stages and to fund growth for larger companies, creating a globalised investment platform accessible to venture capitalists around the world. Blockchain Blockchain technology first became known to the public with the launch of Bitcoin, the world\u2019s first decentralised cryptocurrency. Blockchain created the first solution to digital trust, with a decentralised ledger system that is time-stamped, transparent and prevents the removal of important information. Around five years or so after the launch of Bitcoin, others began to realise that the underpinning blockchain technology could be used as a foundation for many different types of operations, not just cryptocurrencies. By the beginning of 2018, almost 15% of all financial institutions were utilising blockchain technology. A surge of investment led to the use of blockchain across multiple industries, including healthcare, supply chains, transportation, insurance, voting and contract management, to name but a few. Initial Coin Offerings Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are used by start-up companies to raise capital, much in the same way as an initial public offering (IPO). With an IPO, a company sells shares in the business to private investors, who receive returns or dividends on those shares as the company grows and who may be able to sell them on for a higher price at a later date. An ICO is roughly equivalent to this model but using cryptocurrencies. With an ICO, companies aim to raise funds from investors through launching a new coin, service or app. Investors can buy in using pre-existing digital tokens or fiat currency, in exchange for which they receive new digital tokens that are specific to the investment. The funds from investors can then be used by the company to launch its new product, further its goals or develop a new cryptocurrency, with investors hoping to see returns as their tokens grow in value alongside the fortunes of the company. ICOs essentially work as crowd-funding schemes whereby many different investors can purchase a stake in the offering. Opening New Markets Venture capitalists are beginning to see the advantages of ICOs over traditional VC investments as these open up whole new markets to the investor. Historically, venture capital investment has been relatively confined to local markets. ICOs create unique opportunities for the venture capitalist to enter new international markets, making it increasingly possible for an investor on one side of the world to provide funding for a project on the other side of the world. ICOs also break down several of the barriers of traditional venture capitalist investment, such as the necessity of being locked in to the investment for a long period of time. The Regulatory Environment At present, most cryptocurrencies and blockchain are largely unregulated, which creates uncertainty with many venture capitalists. As ICOs create more opportunities for venture capital investment, there is an increasing need for more regulations and control. The challenges are in implementing these without stifling innovation. As much blockchain investment crosses geographical boundaries and jurisdictions, clarification on tax matters is required for when investors trade between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. Creating regulated exchanges for the management of ICOs could help users differentiate legitimate opportunities and learn more about where exactly their money is going. There are clearly still a variety of challenges that need to be addressed before venture capital investment in blockchain hits the mainstream. However, with around US$6 billion raised by ICOs in 2017 and about $55 billion raised by venture capital funds, significant opportunities are being created on a global scale.

While this poses no problems for most markets, it also seems the current gains are not that spectacular by any means. As far as the XRP price is concerned, not much is happening right now. While there is no reason to panic just yet, it seems unlikely the price will go much higher in the very near future. Although it would appear the XRP value has only just begun to climb out of its hole again, there is a chance the momentum will stall or turn around pretty quickly. As is usually the case in the cryptocurrency, token, and digital asset world, there is a good chance the uptrend will fall apart pretty quickly. For XRP, the current gains \u2013 as small as they are \u2013 are still in place, but it seems unlikely the momentum will push the price much higher in the near future. To put this in perspective, the XRP price has still gained 0.55% in USD value, but lost 0.05% over Bitcoin. This latter aspect is not necessarily problematic, but no one will deny XRP hasn\u2019t been too successful in terms of noting gains over Bitcoin. A brief push to 7,600 Satoshi has failed to materialize, as it seems more likely the 7,550 level will fall pretty soon. Not the trend traders are looking for, albeit the $0.31173 level will not necessarily come under too much pressure moving forward. On social media, one has to be very careful with any information gathered today. April Fool\u2019s Day is a pretty interesting day, although it also leads to a lot of conflicting information. TT101 expects massive momentum in the coming days, although the XRP/BTC ratio may not necessarily improve all that much in the coming hours and days. Even so, this downtrend has been in place for quite some time now, thus a reversal is not necessarily out of the question either. There appear to be ongoing discussions by SBI Japan and R3 who are debating how XRP will be integrated into these systems moving forward. A more detailed video is expected to be released soon, although it is a bit unclear what both companies have in mind exactly. Even so, any discussion which briefly touches upon XRP will be well received by the XRP community at this time. It may not necessarily affect the price in any way, though. Although XRP is not necessarily known for its memes or funny images, Cryptoon has come up with a rather funny meme depicting the current mood within the XRP community. Although it is clearly meant to poke fun at some of the more outlandish price predictions, it is evident the video itself will put a smile on many faces. It is also something the community will hopefully appreciate, as a bit of fun has never harmed anyone. While the XRP/BTC ratio is not looking all that great at this time, there is no reason to expect a major retrace in the near future either. In terms of USD value, it would appear the $0.31 level should remain intact, regardless of what happens to Bitcoin. The overall trading volume for XRP still remains rather low, although it should pick up a bit as the day progresses. For now, maintaining a status quo wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a bad thing where XRP is concerned. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Today appears to be one of those days when there is no holding back the meme currency of the internet whatsoever. In fact, it would appear the pumps have been engaged in a dramatic fashion, as the Dogecoin price is simply soaring in quick succession. Wile the year 2019 hasn\u2019t been too great for Bitcoin, Dogecoin, or any other market, that doesn\u2019t mean the situation can\u2019t be turned around in quick succession. There is always a small chance the momentum will suddenly shift significantly, either for better or worse. In the case of Dogecoin, it has clearly turned bullish beyond belief, although it remains to be seen how long this can remain in place. Such a massive uptrend out of nowhere will usually not last too long. To put everything in perspective, it seems the Dogecoin price has risen by 19% in USD value and 18% over Bitcoin. As such, one DOGE is currently valued at $0.002483, or 60 Satoshi. Especially this latter aspect is quite impressive, as Dogecoin had seemingly lost control of 60 Satoshi in recent months. That is usually not a good sign, but Dogecoin has \u2013 somehow \u2013 regained that lost glory in quick succession. A good day for DOGE enthusiasts, although no one should lose their head over this turn of events. On social media, there is always some excitement regarding Dogecoin in many different ways Nevermore is one of the people who likes to poke fun at this project in different ways. He claims how he has now been appointed as the \u201cChief Shilling Officer\u201d for Dogecoin, which would be a very interesting function in many different ways. Especially when the job would be to shill DOGE to XRP and TRX buyers. No one will be surprised to learn most of the discussions pertain to the current DOGE price. It is a sudden turn of events which took a lot of people by surprise earlier today. However, this \u201cwhale momentum\u201d will usually result in a correction of some sorts. If Dogecoin faces a big correction, this entire uptrend can be wiped out without too many problems. It is something to keep in mind at all times. Samstoshi sums up the current state of affairs rather aptly. Dogecoin\u2019s price has pumped on the first of April. While most people would expect this to be a joke, it is in fact happening. Whether or not this is the beginning of the \u201caltcoin season\u201d so many people expected, is a different matter altogether. This uptrend is pretty intriguing in its own regard, as no other market has noted gains similar to these in recent days. How all of this will play out for Dogecoin, is very difficult to predict. It is a very unpredictable market first and foremost, although that has worked in its favor in the past as well. This current steep uptrend, however, will prove rather difficult to sustain if the trading volume doesn\u2019t pick up quickly. So far, that has been the only lackluster aspect of this entire uptrend, but it is something that can be rectified with ease. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Although there is a sea of bullish momentum to keep an eye on, there is always a chance the market will reverse course pretty quickly. As far as the Ravencoin price is concerned, it would appear things are looking very promising right now. A lot of altcoin traders have begun paying attention to Ravencoin over the past few months. Not necessarily for the technical side of the project, but rather because this altcoin allows them to make a lot of good money in the process. There is nothing wrong with chasing ways to make money in this industry, although it may bode troublesome for the future of Ravencoin once a price ceiling has effectively been released. So far, that top is not in place just yet, as a new all-time high seems within reach. Over the past 24 hours, the Ravencoin price has gained 6.5% in USD value and rose by 5.71% compared to Bitcoin. Both trends show there is a lot of interesting in this altcoin. Its current uptrend may be related to the current Bitcoin price uptrend, although that has not necessarily been confirmed at this point. The $33.64m in trading volume seems to help move things along nicely as well. As such, there is a bright future ahead for RVN, at least until this momentum calms down a bit. On social media, there has never been an issue in terms of hyping Ravencoin. Andy Sheu shared an interesting image which shows how versatile the project can be. However, it seems the current price has nothing to do with hype or marketing, but rather the appeal it has to new users. A bit of an interesting message, although it remains to be seen how things will evolve in the future. Rest assured any RVN price increase is met with a lot of hype regardless. It would appear a very interesting development is taking place behind the scenes. More specifically, a community member is working on rewards and dividends. How that feature will look exactly and whether it can convince more people to pay attention to this project as a whole, is up for debate. Any development which can help advance Ravencoin will be welcomed with open arms by the community members. As far as the current RVN price chart is concerned, there is plenty of potential ahead. Although it remains to be seen where the next top will be, Crypto Hunter Gon expects RVN to hit at least 2,000 Satoshi. It currently sits at 1,523 Satoshi, which means another 30% increase should materialize, assuming this chart is correct. It is quite a big leap for this market, but given its history, it is not entirely impossible by any means. As is always the case in the cryptocurrency world, there is always a chance all of the current market momentum will collapse out of the blue. When Bitcoin remains in the green, it seems unlikely the alternative markets will see much pressure in the hours to come. Even so, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is still under a fair bit of pressure, thus no one should expect any major bull runs for Ravencoin or other markets in the near future.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/matthew-ledvina-explores-how-icos-are-globalising-venture-capital-funding/", "author": "Guest", "title": "Matthew Ledvina Explores How ICOS Are Globalising Venture Capital Funding", "content": "Venture capital has traditionally been localised to markets, with investors looking at making early-stage investments confining themselves mainly to fairly local businesses. However, this is all beginning to change with the introduction of ICOs, or initial coin offerings. ICOs are changing the venture capital landscape and providing unique opportunities for investment far further afield than ever before, using blockchain technology to securely open new markets to investors everywhere. Matthew Ledvina works with a venture capital firm that has a strong focus on regtech and fintech investment on a global scale. Blockchain is creating myriad new opportunities for venture capital investment, the effects of which are already beginning to be seen internationally. Cryptocurrency-Focused Start-Ups Blockchain first came into the public domain as the technology behind the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. It provided the solution to the problem of digital trust when talking about online currencies, bringing a decentralised ledger system into play that is transparent, time-stamped and doesn\u2019t allow for the removal of any information. While blockchain can be and has been used for may different types of operation since the advent of Bitcoin, it is still widely associated with cryptocurrencies. Blockchain and cryptocurrency venture capital investments reached US$3.9 billion in just the first three quarters of 2018, according to the research group Diar. Compared to the whole of 2017, this was already an increase of more than 280%. The total number of deals almost doubled as well, according to data from Pitchbook, as did the average size of investment. Crowdfunding Through ICOs Initial coin offerings can be used for capital raising in much the same way as an initial public offering. The difference between an ICO and an IPO is that investors pay in cryptocurrency and, rather than receiving shares, are provided with coins or tokens. These tokens are given in new cryptocurrencies, which are also based on the same underlying blockchain technology. The idea is that as the new venture becomes more successful, the value of the new cryptocurrency rises, and therefore so does the value of the tokens that are owned by the investors. ICOs create unique crowdfunding opportunities whereby investors from almost anywhere in the world can get involved in funding start-ups provided they have access to cryptocurrencies. Blockchain Regulations At present, most blockchain and cryptocurrency markets are largely unregulated, which can create uncertainty for investors. Other potential concerns include the historically volatile nature of the cryptocurrencies that underpin the market, along with the sudden nature of the growth of ICOs. Questions are therefore being raised about the best ways to regulate without curbing innovation. Suggestions include clearer guidelines on the tax situation when exchanging cryptocurrency coins in and out of fiat currencies, along with better regulation and monitoring of crypto-exchanges. If the boom in blockchain investment is to continue, venture capitalists need to be reassured that everything is above board, which involves creating a framework for ICOs that lets people see which are legitimate. As a relatively new field, it is also important to develop a working group of experts, including policy-makers, economists and blockchain innovators. Blockchain has made some important steps in democratising venture capital, but the level of uncertainty means that there is still some way to go before blockchain VC investment enters the mainstream. Matthew Ledvina has a professional interest in both venture capital and in merging technologies, which include blockchain and artificial intelligence. He is an expert on US taxation and has a background in the law and business administration. Follow Matthew Ledvina on Vimeo and YouTube for blockchain and FinTech video updates.

While Bitcoin is currently subjected to a bit of a bullish spell, the same won\u2019t always apply to alternative markets. When looking at the Electroneum price, it quickly becomes evident the recent losses have left a mark on this currency. Recovering them will be a tough challenge, albeit an important first step has been taken. Quite a lot of people were surprised to see Electroneum continually lose value last week. Albeit the overall market conditions have not been the greatest by any means, most of the crypto markets held their own quite well. Electroneum was seemingly incapable of avoiding this downtrend, which is still in effect as of today. However, there currently is a minor gain across the board which can help turn the situation around and make something interesting happen. To be more specific, the Electroneum price has risen by 1.3% in the past few hours. Because of this minor gain, one ETN is now valued at $0.005765. There is also a very small change in ETN/BTC, as a 0.39% gain will not get too many people expected. Sustaining the 140 Satoshi level will be a key challenge for this market moving forward, but it is not entirely impossible to do so as the day progresses. No real gains in ETN/BTC are to be expected at this time. Mr. CryptoCZ is perhaps the biggest Electroneum bull in the world today. This enthusiast recently shared a key list of achievements earned by Electroneum throughout 2018. Considering how the mobile mining apps are now firing on all cylinders and the M1 smartphone seems to be in high demand, things are still looking up in early 2019. Keeping this momentum going will be crucial for this alternative market, although there is always plenty of work to be done. There are a fair few community members who still expect mass adoption of ETN to occur. Soon thinks this altcoin is too good to be ignored, whereas Ziegler Toby expects mass adoption to still be multiple years away at this point. While there is plenty of momentum in favor of Electroneum as of right now, it remains to be seen how this situation evolves moving forward. The crypto industry is not out of the clutches of the bear market trend as of yet, thus anything can happen in the coming months. One particular point of concern is shared by Stevie Haynes. This user confirms the ETN buy support has been eroded slowly in recent days and the buy orders are being stacked at much lower levels. This usually warrants a bearish trend to materialize fairly soon, although one never knows what the future will bring for an alternative market. It appears ETN will see a major market shift pretty soon, either for better or worse. While the current signs do not indicate Electroneum will turn mega bullish in the near future, there is always a chance this may be the beginning of a prominent uptrend. Small gains are usually an indicator some market trend is brewing, although ETN has shown plenty of bearish signals in recent weeks. As long as Bitcoin remains in the green, there will not necessarily be any real problems for alternative markets like Electroneum, but carving out real gains will also be problematic.

There is seemingly a distinctive lack of markets moving up in a significant manner. The VeChain price may be a notable exception in this regard, as this altcoin is finally noting some decently-sized gains. It has been a while since a decisive uptrend or downtrend affected the VeChain market. Price stability is often underrated, yet it makes traders and speculators no money whatsoever. Today, however, there is a lot of good money to be made with VeChain. How long its uptrend can last, is difficult to predict at this time. Over the past 24 hours, the VeChain price has risen by 5.2% in both USD and BTC value alike. Because of this uptrend, one VET is now priced at $0.00616, or 151 Satoshi. Holders will be happy with the way this market has evolved this weekend, even if it may not be indicative of what will happen in the days and weeks to come. On social media, it would appear there is a lot of excitement regarding VeChain\u2019s technology gaining official recognition in China. Whether or not this will impact the VET price in any significant manner, is a different matter altogether. It is always good to see more blockchain projects gain some recognition, although it will not automatically result in price changes. Most cryptocurrency users and traders are interested in price charts and making a profit along the way. Buy & Hold 100Crypto expects a further uptrend for VeChain, albeit the past three months have been pretty bullish in their own regard. A 41% increase in value over three months is not that bad, all things considered. As far as JENS is concerned, VeChain is \u201clooking good\u201d at this time. It is certainly true the uptrend since late 2018 has been in place for quite some time now and shows no signs of slowing down whatsoever. Hitting 175 Satoshi may still be a bridge too far, even right now, but it is not impossible by any means. All things considered, it would appear VeChain is in a rather good place at this time. The gains are solid, although the trading volume is still pretty bleak. Further gains can be noted without too many problems, assuming Bitcoin doesn\u2019t head in the opposite direction again. That is, despite how things may look right now, still a distinct possibility. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/new-euro-pegged-stablecoin-lets-holders-earn-annual-interest/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "New Euro-pegged Stablecoin Lets Holders Earn Annual Interest", "content": "In the cryptocurrency world, stablecoins have become a lot more prominent in the past few years. Whereas Tether\u2019s USDT asset continues to generate the most liquidity, a fair few competitors have emerged in the past 18 months. The Universal Protocol Alliance is now looking to add another stablecoin to the mix, which can earn users up to 8% interest to boot. It will also be a currency tied to the Euro instead of the US Dollar. Most cryptocurrency enthusiasts and trader swill welcome this new stablecoin with open arms. Although stablecoins do not rise or decline in value \u2013 or they shouldn\u2019t, at least \u2013 they can provide a hedge during times when Bitcoin turns rather bearish. Over the past 18 months, there has been an ongoing bearish trend affecting Bitcoin and all alternative markets. As such, traders have been looking for a viable hedge to avoid ongoing losses to their trading portfolio. Stablecoins such as USDT can prove to be rather interesting in that regard. It makes for a different kind of asset, albeit one that can still be exchanged for Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies across most exchanges. The Universal Protocol Alliance, a conglomerate of blockchain organizations, will try to capitalize on this stablecoin momentum. Their goal is to introduce a new currency pegged to the Euro, known as \u201cthe Universal Euro\u201d. This currency will come to market in April of 2019, albeit no further specific date has been announced at this time. Universal Protocol Alliance co-founder Dan Shatt explains: For those who are unfamiliar with the Universal Protocol Alliance, the team is made up of prominent companies and service providers. This list includes Brave, Uphold, Cred, Blockchain at Berkeley, and a few others. It is expected Uphold will be the first trading platform to embrace the UPEUR stablecoin. Participating exchanges will let customers earn interest on their stablecoin through the CredEarn technology. BitGo and Ledger have also confirmed support for this new stablecoin moving forward. Among the main selling points for the Universal Euro are transparency, returns, and low fees. Stablecoins are subject to nearly non-existent volatility, and this new offering can even result in an annual rate of return. To earn the returns, users will stake their UPEUR through the CredEarn application on the Uphold platform. Despite being a stablecoin, it will offer nearly the same features as most cryptocurrencies on the market today. That functionality includes key recovery, which is crucial in terms of keeping assets safe and recovering them if the time arises. How successful this new Euro-pegged stablecoin will be, is very difficult to determine. There have been other attempts to create a Euro-based stablecoin in the past, although its liquidity is always a problem. UPEUR is the first of its kind to provide an annual interest to holders, which is rather interesting to keep an eye on. Even if it doesn\u2019t end up generating a lot of trading volume, users will still be able to reap some rewards from just owning the currency on the Uphold platform. An intriguing development, although one that might not necessarily make the biggest impact.", "date": "2019-04-01T08:11:32+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 1}
{"url": "https://themerkle.com/price-of-paragon-has-multiplied-over-5-times-since-sec-cease-and-desist/", "author": "Zane Huffman", "title": "Price of Paragon has Multiplied Over 5 Times Since SEC Cease-and-Desist", "content": "Through 2018, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) became increasingly active in their regulation of the cryptocurrency space, particularly in regards to recent ICOs. This activity partially came in the form of Cease-and-Desists (C&D) delivered to a number of projects. Of these included Paragon. On November 16th, 2018, Paragon (PRG) received a C&D for their 2017 ICO which raised US$12 million in the sale of, in the eyes of the SEC, unregistered securities. Per the C&D, Paragon was required to pay a US$250,000 fine to the SEC and refund investors of the ICO. In response to the news, PRG dropped to local lows of US$0.02 in the following week, for a market cap of roughly US$1.2 million. As this took place on the same time-frame as Bitcoin\u2019s nosedive from US$6,300, the news hit the Paragon team and holders especially hard. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to recognize that a US$12 million plus $250,000 repayment is a gargantuan of an obstacle for a project barely worth seven figures. As such, many had called for the unfortunate death of Paragon, citing it\u2019s legitimacy as a viable project versus many of the other projects the SEC struck down. Paragon trading followed these predictions. At the end of November, the coin\u2019s market cap had fallen below US$200,000, and daily trading volume barely substantiated above the four figure mark. Of course, the story doesn\u2019t end there. Today, four months later, PRG is trading over US$0.11, with a market cap of over US$7 million. Very impressive growth during the height of the bear market, especially for a project considered dead by the larger space. How did they do it? Paragon is an ecosystem of services that seeks to empower businesses and individuals in the cannabis industry. The primary development the team is working towards is a seed-to-sale tracking solution for cannabis projects, similar to the authenticity tracking developed in projects like VeChain and Waltonchain, where customers will be able to verified the makeup of the strains of marijuana products at dispensaries. Additionally, Paragon has recently developed a mobile application that can be used to make payments, record and message contacts, and interact with other features in the ecosystem. There is a co-working space for PRG users called ParagonSpace through which the app can be used to book appointments and pay. However, proper developments alone do not bring a project \u201cback to life\u201d, as we have unfortunately experienced through a number of projects. The primary component of Paragon\u2019s revival is a lot less eloquent than some of the great things they\u2019ve been doing. On January 1, 2019, the price of PRG was pumped sky-high US$10 per coin. The market cap eclipsed $600 million and Paragon was, for just long enough, displayed proudly on the front page of CoinMarketCap as one of the highest valued projects in the space. This pump happened on a negligible volume of US$25,000 and the price was soon returned to Earth, but it signified enough of a happening to catch the attention of everyone in the space. With everyone talking about PRG, new money inevitably flowed in. Without listing on any larger or better respect exchanges, Paragon saw growth simply from news spreading about this peculiar project. Days after the pump the market cap had already settled above US$5 million. Today, that number has more than doubled to $12 million. And unlike just a few months prior, prospects seem to be looking up for this interesting weed coin.", "date": "2019-03-31T15:41:03+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 31}

So far, there have been plenty of mixed signals on that front. Bearish and minor bullish momentum seem to interchange on a regular basis. For alternative markets, this usually doesn\u2019t bode too well. However, the Holo price isn\u2019t feeling any ill effects because of this uncertain behavior. Although altcoins usually don\u2019t fare too well during the weekend, this edition has proven to offer some interesting momentum regardless. With a lot of markets swinging in either direction, gains and losses are easy to come by. A lot of traders will be happy to see Holo moving up again, albeit ever so slightly. Any small gain is more than welcome at this time, as this market hasn\u2019t had the best of times recently. As far as the Holo price is concerned, the momentum looks far more impressive than initially assumed. Although a 3.1% gain is not necessarily all that great, it is far better than continuing this slow and steady decline. Because of this surprising uptrend, one HOT is now priced at $0.001187, 29 Satoshi, or 839 Etheroshi. All levels are solid, assuming this uptrend doesn\u2019t collapse out of the blue in the hours and days to come. On social media, there is always something new to learn about Holo, HoloChain, or HoloFuel. HoloIslandNews has shared a YouTube video on how HoloFuel economics will work It makes for a very interesting short video which provides some valuable insights as to what will happen to this ecosystem. Making information easier to understand for the average person can get more people interested in this project moving forward. It would also seem the Weiss Ratings team has taken a liking to Holochain. For a non-blockchain crypto project, it seems to offer a powerful service which can genuinely rival the world\u2019s leading providers. That is, assuming this ecosystem can be developed as such, which will remain a difficult question to answer for quite some time to come. When looking at the HOT price chart, it is a bit difficult to make sense of what may be coming next. The status quo is still in effect despite this small uptrend. That would also mean there is no real uptrend in sight although markets tend to evolve in mysterious ways first and foremost. When looking at the bigger picture, the bearish pressure still affecting Bitcoin may not bode too well for Holo\u2019s momentum. Although nothing has ever been set ins tone in this industry, there is a chance some negative momentum will materialize either tonight or tomorrow.

Bitcoin and Ethereum seem to check the right boxes, although it would appear Dogecoin is clearly up there as well. Given its current value increase, the Dogecoin price also appears to be nearing the $0.0021 level once again. Finding any true market indicator over the weekend has been a futile effort over the past few years. Cryptocurrency markets operate on their own accord and seemingly don\u2019t always follow the overall sentiment. Dogecoin, while usually a stable coin, has become increasingly popular because it can maintain its value under most circumstances. In some rare cases, it can even gain value when traders least expect it. To put this in perspective, the past 24 hours have yielded a minor Dogecoin price increase. Following a 0.53% improvement in USD and 0.36% gain in BTC value, it would appear Dogecoin is performing rather well. So much even that reaching $0.0021 should not pose any real problems moving forward. The 51 Satoshi level will also remain in play, but a surge in this department remains unlikely. The big news of the weekend is how a new alpha version of the Doge Racer game has been made available to Patrons. There will also be a live stream of this game this weekend, and further bug fixes will occur over the next few days. It is evident developing a Dogecoin-oriented game is not easy, but the progress to date seems very promising. It would also appear a potential scam is making the rounds in the cryptocurrency world. Users are being targeted to buy company names through the Ethereum Name Service by an unknown individual. One user even responded by offering to pay 5,000 DOGE instead of 5,000 ETH for this purpose. It seems unlikely that offer will be accepted, though. For those who merely look at the DOGE price chart, it is a bit difficult to make sense of what will happen next. As there is still no clear direction in place, this minor uptrend can be negated without too many problems. Even so, the weekly chart doesn\u2019t look half bad right now which may indicate some upward momentum will materialize fairly soon. As is always the case where Dogecoin is concerned, the current market conditions can change at any given momentum. Whether that will be for better or worse, is a difficult question to answer at this point. There isn\u2019t much trading volume and the overall gains are relatively small.

All of the top markets have noted small to medium-sized gains at this time. The Dash price, while often overlooked in this volatile industry, has noted some significant gains in the process. In fact, it is the most bullish market in the entire market cap top 75. It is evident a lot of eyes are still on Bitcoin\u2019s price momentum first and foremost. Not necessarily because a further bearish trend is expected, but it will dictate the pace of all alternative markets for quite some time to come. In the case of Dash, it doesn\u2019t seem to rely as much on Bitcoin as some other markets. However, a bullish surge in BTC can easily trigger a lot of excitement for alternative markets as well. As Bitcoin is now up by nearly 1%, it is only normal the altcoins, assets, and tokens show signs of life. Over the past 24 hours, the Dash price has risen by 12.65% in USD value and 11.6% in BTC value. Those are phenomenal gains, especially when considering the new week has only just begun. With a current value of $114.83, or 0.0278 Bitcoin, Dahs seems to be doing the job just fine. Its trading volume is also picking up a bit, as over $347m worth of Dash has changed hands recently. If this level of trading can remain in place, there will be some further interesting momentum to look forward to this week. Although there isn\u2019t too much news regarding Dahs, there is a recent community Q&A which has been shared with the rest of the world. In terms of communicating with their community, the Dash team certainly has positioned itself quite well. Updates like these tend to keep people engaged and interested at all times. It may not affect the price by any means, but it is still good to see the transparency being maintained. Due to the lack of actual news, it is only normal to expect a lot of people looking at the price charts right now. The Dash chart introduced by Endoryan shows there is some promising momentum taking shape right now, although nothing is ever certain in this volatile industry. As promising as things may look right now, there is always a chance the momentum will sour when people least expect it. For Dash, such a downfall seems rather unlikely, but there is always a chance something will occur. For those traders who prefer to explore different ways of making money, Dash is part of an ongoing loop arbitrage option with a profit potential of up to 19%. It involves using Livecoin and OKEx, which are not necessarily the worse exchanges by any means. However, there may not be too much liquidity to make major profits either. As such, looking into this opportunity is worthwhile, but no one should expect to make thousands of dollars from this trade. When looking at the bigger picture, there may be plenty of upward momentum for all markets throughout the day. As long as Bitcoin doesn\u2019t fall off a cliff again, there is a genuine chance this may be the beginning of a slightly extended bull run. For Dash, a push to $115 will occur pretty soon, but noting gains beyond that point may prove to be somewhat difficult. In terms of Dash/BTC, a push to 0.028 BTC is not out of the question.

It is commendable to see some altcoins, tokens, and assets attempt to buck the inevitable trend, albeit most effort will ultimately be in vain. Despite some promising changes this week, the Dogecoin price is losing some of its regained value already. When it comes to analyzing individual cryptocurrency markets, it is often futile to look for common denominators. Altcoins follow Bitcoin, a trend that has become more than apparent in the past few years. Dogecoin, while often successful in terms of negating bearish pressure, appears to follow Bitcoin\u2019s trend today as well.

Over the past 24 hours, the Dogecoin price balance shows a 0.5% loss in USD value and a 0.4% setback over Bitcoin. Because of these negative developments, one DOGE is worth $0.002079, or 52 Satoshi. Both of these levels have been in play for over a week now and seem to act as support. However, if Bitcoin were to turn mega bearish, it remains to be seen where DOGE\u2019s value will end up at. What is somewhat worrisome for Dogecoin is how its overall trading volume has nearly collapsed. Although $20.4m in trades is not bad by any means, it is not sufficient to keep these levels afloat for long. As such, it seems logical to assume there may be some further pressure on this market. Ensuring no massive losses are sustained will be the main order of business for this weekend. On social media, there is some good news for fans of Dogecoin and cryptocurrency faucets. ES Faucets is making a surprising return all of a sudden, which is a bit surprising. The team was running crypto mining scripts on their site, which earned them some negative feedback. Those scripts are now gone, and the faucet functionality is back again. Those who prefer to keep an eye on the Dogecoin chart rather than directly trading it may notice some interesting opportunities. There is still a chance for a 20% gain to materialize in the weeks to come. That will only be possible if the current support levels remain in place, which is an uncertain development as of right now. When taking all of the information into account, it remains to be seen how things will evolve for Dogecoin over the course of the weekend. Nothing is ever set in stone in this industry, regardless of what may be happening to Bitcoin in the process. No major losses should be expected at this time, although regaining the $250m market cap level will be a different kind of challenge. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Traders saw a good opportunity to make money and its trading volume soared to new heights pretty quickly. That situation hasn\u2019t remained in place for long, as the BitTorrent Token price has taken a serious beating ever since. Today, however, it seems some minor gains are materializing in quick succession. It is always difficult to make sense of new cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets when they first launch. Although there is always a lot of excitement, very few of these projects manage to sustain any real growth a few months down the line. BitTorrent Token is no exception by any means, as its initial value has not been seen ever since. In fact, it seems the slow and steady decline remains in place several weeks later, which is not a promising sign. Over the past 24 hours, it has become apparent BitTorrent Token might note some gains after all. With a 0.8% gain in USD, BTC, and TRX, the current BitTorrent Token price sits at $0.000767, 19 Satoshi, or 0.03283796 TRX. All of these levels seem pretty solid, all things considered, although sustaining these gains may prove to be rather difficult. When looking at the BTT trading volume, however, there isn\u2019t any real reason for excitement whatsoever. With $15.3m in trades, it seems the overall interest in BitTorrent Token has calmed down significantly. As such, the price may collapse again in the coming days, although it remains to be seen what will happen next. Reclaiming the $150m market cap level will seemingly not happen overnight. It would appear there is also some genuine dislike toward BTT, which will not be all too surprising to most people. Andiiii, for example, expects the first major price target for BitTorrent Token to be near the 12 Satoshi level. That would represent a near 33% decline in value, which is \u2013 when looking at the bigger picture \u2013 not entirely unlikely either. As such, the coming weeks will prove to be rather interesting overall. Turkish traders have shown a keen interest in BitTorrent Token, although not necessarily for the right reasons. Eser26 seems to confirm BTT needs to break out of this downward wedge sooner rather than later, but it seems rather unlikely that will happen. However, this user still expects a potential rise to 49-50 Satoshi in the long run, which may be rather optimistic under the current circumstances. Unlike some other markets, the BTT value may rely on Bitcoin a lot more than other markets. That is not necessarily a bad thing when the momentum turns somewhat promising. However, weekends are never an indicator as to what will happen to this particular market in the coming days and weeks. For BitTorrent Token, it seems further pressure lies ahead, although it can be broken with some effort. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

As the uneasy market momentum remains in place, it remains to be seen who will buck the trend in a decisive manner. So far, it would appear the Digitex Futures price is putting up a strong fight. Its nearly non-existent trading volume remains a sore point, however, With thousands of cryptocurrency, token, and asset projects to keep an eye on, finding a spot in the market cap top 100 becomes an increasingly difficult challenge. For Digitex Futures, it seems the current momentum might allow it to gain a few ranks in quick succession. It is one of the few markets to note medium-sized gains right now, which will get a few traders excited in the process. Over the past 24 hours, the Digitex Futures price has risen by 4.25% to $0.085976. There are also gains over Bitcoin \u2013 3.61% \u2013 and Ethereum \u2013 2.93% \u2013 respectively, which paints an intriguing picture. One mystery remains, however, as DGTX notes just $630,000 in trading volume. Why this figure remains so low for a $63.4m market cap project, is anyone\u2019s guess at this time. The recently released report by the DGTX team has a lot of holders and speculators excited. This project noted very strong gains during the month of March, despite there being some periods of bearish pressure. As such, it seems there is plenty to look forward to, albeit a potential price correction should not be overlooked either. This report itself also has plenty of people excited for the month of April. Crypto Don Juan expects big things to happen in late April and early May. While it remains to be seen if anything worth noting will occur at that time, it is crucial to keep advancing this ecosystem. So far, it seems there are some intriguing developments on the horizon, although their impact on the DGTX price may be minimal at best. Crypto News, on the other hand, would like to see more people invest in Digitex Futures. While it may be an undervalued project in this person\u2019s opinion, it appears the rest of the community doesn\u2019t necessarily agree. Once the Digitex Futures Exchange launches in late April, that situation may very well change. As is always the case when a particular market rises in value when Bitcoin is bearish, this uptrend may be temporary. A lot of traders are desperate for profit right now yet chasing pumps is never a smart choice. For Digitex Futures, the continuous lack of trading volume paints a bleak picture. Changing that situation may not be all that easy either, as HitBTC and Mercatox simply aren\u2019t that popular compared to other exchanges. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

One noteworthy example is the Enjin Coin price, which seemingly cannot catch a break. A rough Sunday lies ahead for this market, although the current momentum is not definitive by any means. When the individual cryptocurrency markets start to move in opposite directions, there is a lot of money to be made or lost in quick succession. As long as Bitcoin remains in the green, the rest of the markets should, under normal circumstances, stay in the green as well. During the weekend, that natural order has proven very difficult to maintain for reasons unknown. As far as the Enjin Coin price is concerned, it would appear the momentum is bearish first and foremost. This is not what traders and holders are looking for, although this decline is not entirely surprising either at this time. ENJ Has had a good run in recent weeks, yet it seems the correction is finally kicking in. Every market needs a good reset now and then. this 5.5% downturn brings the value to just below $0.15, which won\u2019t please too many people. In terms of overall trading volume, Enjin Coin performs as one would come to expect from a Saturday, There is a notable decrease in volume, albeit not necessarily a worrisome one. Binance remains the biggest market, although some interesting action is happening on Upbit and Bithumb as well. For now, no further price decline is expected. On social media, the opinions regarding ENJ are a bit all over the place. Charles Russell expects this altcoin to be \u201cripe for bagging\u201d again, which would usually indicate an accumulation period has presented itself. Only time will tell if that is effectively the case, as this dip doesn\u2019t make the market look too appealing to traders and speculators. For those who want to look at the ENJ chart, things are not looking too great by any means. As the initial support level was broken with relative ease, the coming hours may prove crucial in terms of finding the actual bottom. If that process fails, this market can see further losses pile up in the coming 24-36 hours. Although Enjin Coin looks a lot more bearish than one would come to expect, this correction is long overdue. It may not necessarily grow much steeper than this, although there is still a lot of pressure on ENJ which will not disappear all of a sudden. Sustaining the $0.149 level will be extremely challenging, but far from impossible. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

As is usually the case, the Bitcoin momentum an easily spoil the party without much effort. So far, it seems the Zilliqa price shows no signs of slowing down, especially now that $0.02 has been surpassed without any real problems It doesn\u2019t happen all that often Zilliqa effectively notes real gains when traders and speculators want to make it happen. More often than not, this altcoin market remains subdued, although there have been some rather intriguing developments taking place behind the scenes. Today, it seems as if ZIL is cashing in on those developments, at least for the time being. To be more specific, the past 24 hours have yielded a 5.5% Zillia price increase across the board. Following this uptrend, one ZIL is now priced at $0.020199, 493 Satoshi, or 14.281 Etheroshi. With just under $16m in trading volume, there isn\u2019t much to be concerned about, although sustaining this uptrend may require a bit more liquidity. As one would come to expect, most traders and speculators keep a very close eye on the ZIL chart right now. Even though the current momentum looks rather promising, Kripto-Takip isn\u2019t too sure what to make of the market. Some potential targets have been identified, although reaching them is always more difficult than originally assumed. Blockchain Bull seems to project a very different potential price trend for Zilliqa which isn\u2019t as promising. In fact, if ZIL fails to break out of this channel in a positive manner, it seems likely the price will turn bearish again pretty soon. The coming hours and days may prove rather crucial for this altcoin, although no one can accurately predict what will happen next. Last but not least, Crypto Wunderbaer tries to keep faith in Zilliqa. More specifically, this is the only trader who openly confirms there is a promising ZIL/USD trend shaping up. As is usually the case, this will mainly depend on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum, which looks anything but solid at this point. Additionally, this trend is by no means an indicator as to what will happen in the coming few days. When looking at the big picture, it is only normal Zilliqa tries to carve out some gains after maintaining the status quo for some time. The big question is whether or not these gains can be solidified and a higher support level can be created in the process.

While there is still a long way to go in this regard, it would appear the Binance Coin price is trying to move up swiftly. After successfully surpassing $17, the sky seems to be the limit. This past week has not been the best for most cryptocurrencies, tokens, and altcoins. There has been some rather negative pressure on most markets, although no one knows why this occurred in the first place. Even Binance Coin went through a bit of a retrace in the process, although it appears most of those losses have been recovered already. As such, traders have high hopes for what may yet be to come. In the past 24 hours, the Binance Coin price has gained 4.5% in USD, BTC, and ETH value alike. Because of these sudden gains, the BNB value now sits at $17.35, 0.00423 Bitcoin, or 0.1223 Ether. As such, it seems there may be further gains on the horizon, even though the overall trading volume isn\u2019t necessarily looking that bad. With $201m in trades, there appears to be a genuine demand for BNB at this time, albeit that situation may come to change in the near future. On social media, there has never been anything but excitement regarding Binance Coin. Simon Lovera de Leon isn\u2019t too bothered by any negative comments either, as this user deems BNB to be the most profitable coin on the market as of right now. When half of one\u2019s portfolio is made up of one currency, it has to perform as expected first and foremost. So far, it seems Binance Coin is performing as expected, although the all-time high is still well out of reach. Those who are mainly interested in the current price chart may notice there is room for further upward potential. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the price will keep going up from this point forward, although one never knows how individual crypto markets will evolve throughout the weekend. Binance Coin seems to be doing its own thing first and foremost, thus the remainder of the day could prove to be rather interesting. Klondike also has high expectations for Binance Coin throughout the day and over the course of next week. The uptrend appears to be in full effect as of right now, although there is always a chance the momentum will dissipate in quick succession. As is usually the case where technical analysis is concerned, it will only works every so often. When looking at the bigger picture, it seems the Binance Coin value is rising because of Bitcoin\u2019s recovery. If the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency were to turn bearish again this weekend, one never knows how things will evolve as far as the alternative markets are concerned. For now, things are looking up for BNB, but no one should be chasing the top by any means. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While most people would expect EOS to not sustain real losses under the current circumstances, the alleged link to Bithumb\u2019s hack could prove to be troublesome. As the EOS price has now lost a bit of value in quick succession, it will be interesting to see what the future bring. Those traders who can look beyond the Bithumb news will acknowledge EOS would be subjected to a bit of retrace sooner or later. Although that wasn\u2019t necessarily planned for this weekend, no one will be too surprised to see this trend materialize. It remains to be seen if EOS funds were effectively stolen from Bithumb last night, although the company has not officially confirmed that is the case at this time. Even if that were to be the case, it remains to be seen if customer funds are affected. To put the past 24 hours into its proper perspective, the EOS price lost 2.11% in both USD and BTC value alike. As such, the current price sits near the $4.23 level, or 0.00103260 Bitcoin. While both levels are still pretty impressive at this time, it remains to be seen if there will be further pressure moving forward. The trading volume of EOS has not struggled in the slightest, which is perhaps the most promising aspect of the day so far. On social media, there will always be a few people making fun of what is happening to Bithumb. Why that is the case, is a very good question which can\u2019t be answered at this time. Crypto Sarah seems to have a lot of fun because of this hack. This Tweet also mentions how both EOS and XRP funds are missing, although the exact figures and details remain a bit unclear. Even so, incidents like these are never to be made fun of, as they usually don\u2019t bode well for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. In more positive and tangible news, it would appear there are some interesting messages being shared by Dan Larimer lately. He confirmed the Apple wallet source code will be open source, which is always interesting to keep an eye on. There is also a potential correlation between Block One and the US government, although there is still plenty of work to be done. How serious all of these messages need to be taken, is always subject to interpretation first and foremost. Furthermore, the EOS ecosystem is still firing on all cylinders, even though some of these developments tend to get overlooked on a regular basis. Scatter continues to work on their own services and products, which can help improve the overall adoption of EOS and its associated products and services. Developments like these show there is plenty of positive momentum brewing behind the scenes, although they may not impact the price in any significant manner. Although things are not looking too great for EOS right now, the same can be said for many other markets as well. These losses are not insurmountable by any means, even though it will cause some problems along the way as well. Based on the current trend, it seems most of the deficits will be recuperated pretty quickly, although shifting into the green again will pose a fair few hurdles. That is not necessarily a bad thing by any means, but traders will remain uneasy until things settle down again. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Further down the rankings, however, it seems the Basic Attention Token price is getting a lot of attention. Its most recent uptrend has made traders a lot of good money this afternoon, yet it remains to be seen if this momentum is still in place 24 hours from now. Not too many people will be surprised to learn Bitcoin\u2019s minor promising spell also bodes well for the alternative markets. Altcoins heavily rely on Bitcoin\u2019s price momentum, although some try to do their own thing at all times..Basic Attention Token falls into this latter category more often than not. Traders claim that is also one of its core strengths under these market circumstances. To be more specific, the Basic Attention Token price has gained 16.7% in USD and BTC value today, as well as nearly 16% over Ether. The current value sits at $0.282477, or 6,901 Satoshi. Both of these levels seem rather peculiar as they are on the halfway point between the current support and next resistance levels. With the weekend on the horizon, very interesting momentum could materialize. There are always some developments taking place behind the scenes which are worth keeping an eye on. The Brave team has launched a new community hub for the Basic Attention Token news, information, and so forth. Platforms like these can help improve upon the current BAT adoption rate, although there is always plenty of work to be done regardless. Additionally, it would appear the Brave team has also begun introducing BAT rewards for Android users. Although this is still a beta feature at this time, it is a pretty interesting change altogether. Given how many people use a browser on their mobile device, it seems to be a big step in the right direction. Chart watchers will not necessarily be too keen on what is happening to BAT at this time. Although there is a very strong uptrend in place, it also seems like this can collapse in an hour from now. Basic Attention Token struggles to maintain momentum every single time it goes up, thus it seems unlikely this time will be any different. As is always the case when the weekend looms on the horizon, it remains to be seen what will happen to Bitcoin. Those potential changes will also impact the Basic Attention Token trend for better or worse. As such, there will be plenty of exciting momentum to look forward to.

This weekend is no different, although a fair few markers suffer from bearish pressure. Very few offerings can buck this trend, and it would appear the IOTA price is feeling the pressure at this time. It is not uncommon for the top crypto markets to flash some bearish signals during the weekend. Most of the weekends to date have resulted in either minor losses or very minor gains for these markets. Today, the pressure seems to be in full effect, especially now that Bitcoin has dipped in the red for no apparent reason. This usually doesn\u2019t bode well for markets in the top 25, as IOTA clearly illustrates. Over the past few hours, the IOTA price has lost 1.17% in USD value and 1.03% over Bitcoin. Because of these setbacks, the current price sits at $0.304924, or 7,463 Satoshi. Although these levels are still more than respectable, one has to wonder if things will remain anywhere near these values for much longer. After all, there is a good chance the bearish Bitcoin momentum will drive the MIOTA price down even further. When glancing across social media, it seems the community is not too worried about the current price whatsoever. In fact, the Iota team has confirmed equity-free funding and a 12-month programme are available to IOTA and DLT developers, courtesy of LEDGER. This company is not to be confused with the hardware wallet manufacturers, as both companies are separate things. Another step forward for blockchain and IOTA, which is always a good sign. It would also appear the OnePageX exchange team is making it easier for consumers and enthusiasts to purchase IOTA. Although it is one of the multiple supported currencies, their exchange widget can be integrated into any platform. This can drive global IOTA adoption forward, assuming there is any genuine interest in this particular offering. Cryptocurrency traders who are not too keen on holding IOTA at this time may want to look into arbitrage trading. It would appear this particular altcoin offers an interesting option for profit when flipping coins between Binance and Gate. With a potential profit of over 3.4%, this opportunity will not necessarily remain accessible for very long. Even though the overall market trend looks rather bleak, it seems unlikely IOTA and consorts will note any steep losses in the coming days. That is, assuming Bitcoin doesn\u2019t go on a crazy downward spiral, which always remains a distinct possibility. For now, the $0.304 level should hold where IOTA is concerned, although there will be some resistance along the way as well. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

The XRP price, while often rather resilient, is disappointing a lot of holders and traders today. It struggles to maintain its current level and risks dropping below 7,500 Satoshi over the weekend. In the cryptocurrency and digital asset world, joy and disappointment are often entwined in mysterious ways. Whereas Bitcoin\u2019s value tried to move up ever so slightly, it seems XRP is the one market losing out on the uptrend. In fact, it is the only top three market to note losses in both USD and BTC value today, which is somewhat unexpected. Unfortunately for holders, it also appears unlikely this situation will improve. When looking at the past 24 hours, the XRP price hasn\u2019t performed as expected. A 0.75% loss in USD value drives the price down to $0.307795. There is also the 1.31% deficit over Bitcoin, bringing that ratio to 7,519 Satoshi. It seems very likely the 7,500 Satoshi level will not act as support over the weekend, which could spell big trouble for XRP. On social media, the sentiment toward XRP has not changed much despite this most recent dip. Haydar Sayar, for example, expected this bearish pressure, although he still expects big things for the asset in question. It is a bit unclear what this ultimatum until \u201c2023\u201d means exactly, as waiting four more years for a bull run is not something most traders look forward to. There are always speculators who consider XRP as a market being manipulated. Although it is evident this asset isn\u2019t following the uptrend of other top markets in the past month, three months, and six months, claiming it is being \u201cheld down\u201d is a bridge too far as well. For the time being, it will be interesting to see if and when this situation improves. When it comes to looking at the XRP chart, there isn\u2019t too much to get excited about either. Although an uptrend can easily materialize out of nowhere, it seems the downtrend will be continued for some time to come. How low the price will drop, is anyone\u2019s guess. Holders will hope things do not get too dire, albeit it is impossible to make any accurate predictions in this regard. As the weekend is just around the corner, it will be interesting to see if the XRP momentum can be turned around in quick succession. As weekends are usually adverse in terms of trading trends, it may very well happen. However, the overall trading volume remains well below $1bn, which doesn\u2019t instill too much confidence either. An interesting weekend lies ahead, either for better or worse.

Although there are numerous companies operating without problems, the same cannot be said for Bithumb. Once South Korea\u2019s largest exchange, it has now become a seemingly prone target for hackers and criminals. The company confirmed a new heist which will spark some very juice mainstream media headlines. This entire incident involving the Bithumb exchange will undoubtedly raise a lot of questions. This particular exchange has been subjected to at least one previous incident not that long ago. While one would expect such major companies to learn from their mistakes, it seems a completely new problem has popped up in the process. According to the company\u2019s official explanation, there has been an incident which is labeled as an \u201caccident\u201d. To put this ordeal in its proper perspective, the company has delayed cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals earlier this week. The reason for doing so remained unclear at the time, although new information has come forward ever since. It appears the company took this rather harsh course of action because of abnormal withdrawals being detected. Its in-house monitoring system immediately flagged some odd behavior by users, which is why these artificial delays were introduced. After carefully investigating the matter, the Bithumb team ensured all funds from the cold wallet were safe. It turns out this was not an actual hacking attempt, but more of an internal problem caused by the exchange\u2019s own staffers. Referred to by the company as \u201cinsiders\u2019, it seems the problem can be considered to be an inside job. What that would mean exactly, remains a bit of a mystery at this time. The KISA and Cyber Police Agency are helping the exchange to look into this string of unusual incidents at this time. As one would come to expect, the company has also confirmed some funds has been lost in the process. How much funds have been stolen, is a bit unclear, as conflicting figures are circulating on the internet right now. Recovering the funds will be difficult, if not entirely impossible at this stage. It seems unlikely this theft of funds will cause problems for Bithumb customers, which is a silver lining many people will be rather pleased with. It is also expected the deposits and withdrawals will be resumed shortly as well. On Reddit, this particular incident is getting a lot of attention, albeit not necessarily for the right reasons. A lot of people expect this \u201cinside job\u201d to be something else entirely, although there is no evidence to back up such claims at this time. There is also plenty of speculation as to how much money is missing and which currencies might be affected by this incident. Until further notice by Bithumb themselves, those discussions are mere speculation and not based on actual facts. Given how this is not the first incident involving the Bithumb exchange, one has to wonder how this will affect the company\u2019s position moving forward. South Korea is still an important region in terms of cryptocurrency usage, although incidents like these have become very common in that part of the world lately. For Bitcoin and altcoins, this news is problematic as well, although it seems unlikely any major markets will be affected.", "date": "2019-03-30T12:54:49+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 30}

Although there are still numerous markets in the red, some others are moving up again. Contrary to most people\u2019s expectations, it appears the Binance Coin price may not be noting any real gains as the day progresses. It is always intriguing to note how individual cryptocurrency markets tend to evolve as more time progresses. When Bitcoin turns bearish, it is evident the other markets will come under a lot of pressure as well. Binance Coin, while not relying on Bitcoin on most days, is seemingly trying to get its act together once again. So far, that has proven to be rather difficult, but there is always a chance things will improve further down the line. For now, however, the losses remain in place. Over the past 24 hours, the Binance Coin price has dropped by 1.3% to $16.65. There are also deficits of 1.65% over Bitcoin and 1.85% over Ethereum. It is a bit of an uncommon trend, primarily because BNB tends to move up in quick succession regardless of the overall circumstances. Although the trading volume of BNB is not necessarily bothersome by any means, it is also a lot lower compared to the previous days and weeks. Despite this negative market trend, there are some developments to look forward to. It would appear Binance Coin has finally gotten listed on Bitrue, where it will be paired with XRP, Bitcoin, and USDT. Three pretty interesting trading pairs which can introduce plenty of additional liquidity for Binance Coin in the process. Bitrue also has a seemingly decent reputation among traders, thus this can be a prominent development for the BNB ecosystem as a whole. Additionally, it would appear a new partnership between Binance and Crypto Voucher has been established. The objective of this collaboration is to make the purchase of BNB easier for all parties involved. For now, it remains to be seen if there is any interest in this new offering and how it will affect the BNB value in the process. It is good to see this exchange-oriented token gain more use cases outside of Binance itself. For all of the positive news, there is also some dismay as to how BNB is being traded on the Cryptobulls exchange. Although most traders have not heard of this trading platform to date, it would appear there is some concern regarding its legitimacy. More specifically Miyukri considers CryptoBulls to be a \u201cfake exchange\u201d due to rather lengthy withdrawal delays. If that is indeed true, it can negatively impact Binance Coin as well. As no real significant losses have been sustained where Binance Coin is concerned, there is no real reason to panic either. It is certainly true things could be improved upon from here on out, but with the weekend around the corner, that may prove to be a difficult goal. The lack of exciting trading volume can easily send this market in a further negative spiral, although it is still early to draw any real conclusions in this regard.

As AI offers a tailored experience to those frequent visitors the question remains as to whether or not the two could ever truly work in harmony to provide an experience that is unmatched by any other. Artificial intelligence has begun to make its way into every aspect of our lives as technology evolves. With machine learning being present in-home devices such as the Google Home and Amazons Alexa as well as in cars and the technology that they use. This is the implementation of machine learning that can respond to a command that you are looking for and is present in everyday devices such as our mobile phones and even thermostats. Although this is becoming more and more common, it is only beginning to be adopted in the world of cryptocurrency the question is does it work? Due to AI learning from the behavior of the people using it, this could be beneficial for tracking trading behaviors as well as optimizing your experience to suit your needs. With a number of companies using the implementation of AI to tailor the trading experience of cryptocurrency as well as predicting fluctuations in the prices showing real potential to heavily influence the business sector. By using artificial intelligence within the world of cryptocurrency you are reducing the risk of human error on the likes of payments and contracts. This makes it a benefit for individual and businesses alike as it helps to streamline the process as well as ensuring that all payments are secure. AI can also be used to calculate the number of bitcoin that are in circulation through each individual computer helping to automate the process and make the mining process much more efficient. This could make the process of trading and dealing in cryptocurrency much easier for large businesses as this will offer frequent updates on markets as well as remember trading behaviours allowing them much quicker access to information. This AI can help to monitor the value of bitcoin also as this can offer notifications of any fluctuations that may occur which has helped to create an improved user experience on the platform since being founded 10 years ago. The use of AI can also help to speed up the process of trading as well as the security surrounding each transaction. With AI able to predict the value of the currency in the coming months, businesses are able to be much smarter with their money and make payments at a time that benefits them. Although the implementation of such technology is inevitable it is important to use it to your advantage, as the more information that you give the algorithm the more it will be able to help you. Due to the lack of corruption surrounding this currency, you will not be hit with any hidden charges, this then means that businesses can predict profit margins as well as any potential drops in advance. This is significant as this provides more financial stability as this currency is not affected by inflation rates or taxes. The main function of AI within bitcoin is to monitor the value of your stock as well as the market as a whole. This analytics provides additional information to users allowing them to make more informed decisions. This intelligence will use the information that it collects from your search patterns as well as the intelligence from the stocks and combines them allowing you to develop your knowledge and trade with confidence. Despite this being in the early stages, there are big plans in the future to further expand the use of AI within cryptocurrency to provide more information to users as well as an all-round secure experience with ultimate precision. As cryptocurrency and AI continue to become ever closer it is bringing big changes to the industry as well as the business sector making this alternative currency far more appealing to big businesses looking for an efficient way to trade.", "date": "2019-03-28T15:02:26+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 28}

Whereas most markets try to note some form of bullish momentum, Electroneum is heading in the opposite direction. So much even that the Electroneum price has now officially turned bearish, at least temporarily. In the cryptocurrency world, there is no such thing as individual markets making sense to the average onlooker. Electroneum is a very interesting example in this regard, a sit follows a completely opposite trend compared to Bitcoin and other top markets. Although some bearish pressure looms ahead for most cryptocurrency markets right now, one wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect ETN to be one of the first to note pretty steep losses at this time. Over the past 24 hours, the Electroneum price has lost 0.86% in USD value and 1.44% in BTC value. As a result, one ETN is now priced at $0.006040, or 148 Satoshi. It is rather interesting to keep an eye on both of these trends, although neither of them is looking too great. Perhaps the most worrisome aspect is how ETN\u2019s trading volume has collapsed entirely. After several days of multi-million dollar trading, the volume has dropped to $281,000 again. Not the most impressive development. On social media, it quickly becomes apparent some interesting things are happening behind the scenes. South Africa appears to be an interesting market for Electroneum right now. An informal trader has begun spreading the word about ETN and is now telling others about how this ecosystem works. It is an intriguing region as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned. South Africa could become a hotbed of crypto activity, assuming regulators allow it to thrive in the years to come. Speaking of Electroneum\u2019s presence in South Africa, it would appear a local car wash now officially accepts ETN transactions in exchange for its services. Although this may not prove to be the most lucrative option for this particular company, it is comforting to see cryptocurrencies make inroads in this part of the world. There is still a very long way to go until Electroneum becomes really big in South Africa, but these are important steps in the right direction. It is always interesting to see how altcoin traders deal with the current uneasy market momentum. WallSt, for example, is quite happy with his ETN holdings, even though this market is one of the first to dip in the red in such a decisive manner. Other altcoins are not doing too great either right now, but that is only to be expected under these circumstances. It is always possible ETN will recover at some point in the near future, although one never knows for sure. For the time being, it remains to be seen what the coming hours will hold for all cryptocurrency markets. If Electroneum is an indication of what is yet to come, there will be a major downtrend for all markets in the near future. That wouldn\u2019t necessarily be appealing to traders and speculators, but it remains to be seen what will come next. For now, the $0.006 level should remain intact, but there will be some pressure on this market for some time to come. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

That in itself is a good sign, primarily because all projects have their own individual value and worth. Despite facing a ton of controversy, the Tron price is still rising. Given how irate a lot of community members are over Justin Sun\u2019s \u201cbotched\u201d Tesla giveaway, that situation may change sooner rather than later. Although the actions of Justin Sun and the value of the Tron network should be seen as two separate things, that is not necessarily the case for everyone. In fact, it would appear the community is starting to turn its back on both Sun and Tron because of the recent Tesla giveaway \u201cshit show\u201d. Cryptocurrency community members can be a feisty bunch, although drawing a winner, sharing it in a video, then pulling the video offline and posting a new random draw video will not bode well for the public image of Tron either. Over the past 24 hours, the Tron price has gained 1.35% to rise to $0.023548. There is also a near 2% improvement in TRX/BTC, pushing the ratio to 582 Satoshi. It still seems unlikely a push to 600 Satoshi will occur over the weekend, although one never knows what the weekend will bring. There is also more than sufficient trading volume to keep things going right now, although it remains to be seen how dire things will get due to this community outrage. Maintaining the $11 rank in market cap is also a big challenge, it would seem. The big news is how Justin Sun recently confirmed he would live stream the \u201cTesla contest\u201d winner. While that video was indeed uploaded to the internet, it was also rendered invalid\u201d by Sun himself due to a \u201cTwitter glitch\u201d. A bit unusual, especially when considering how the video can be seen on Twitter just fine. As such, the person who effectively won the giveaway will not receive his prize, which has created a lot of bad blood between Tron, Sun, and the crypto community. It would appear this odd way of dealing with the crucial giveaway has already created a lot of bad blood. Splash, for example, wonders if anyone is even surprised by this \u201cscam\u201d. The answer to that question seems rather self-explanatory, although it should not serve as a platform to promote both EOS and Cardano in the process. Even so, the way this giveaway was conducted tends to raise a lot of new questions which do not bode well for the Tron project as a whole. Once a level of trust is thrown out of the window, it can never be regained in full. CryptoGunby is already past the point of bashing both Tron and Justin Sun over this \u201coutrageous\u201d turn of events. Instead, he took the more mature approach and removed all references regarding Tron from his Twitter profile. It will be interesting to see how this entire situation will be resolved in the near future, as there is still a chance everything will be made right. It seems unlikely at this time, but one never knows how things evolve in the cryptocurrency world. Stranger things have happened, after all. Based on all of the extracurricular activities surrounding the Tron creator, it will be interesting to see if the TRX price is affected in any way. Knowing how this particular market evolves, it seems unlikely the \u201cTron army\u201d will let that happen. As the top markets remain bearish, though, there will be some repercussions for TRX at some point down the line. This weekend may prove to be very crucial in many different ways, although the price direction remains uncertain. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

This trend would materialize sooner or later, primarily because Bitcoin was looking pretty weak yesterday afternoon. Although the losses remain contained, it will be interesting to see if the Litecoin price can remain above $60 for much longer. In the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin\u2019s price trend will set the tone for all alternative markets in quick succession. When Bitcoin goes up, other markets thrive. If the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency loses value, it would appear the markets will turn bearish in both USD and BTC value alike. As Bitcoin is now looking to resume the bearish angle, altcoins such as Litecoin have already begun losing value as well. Not the trend people are looking for, but it remains to be seen how much damage will be done in the process. Over the past 24 hours, the Litecoin price dropped by 1.63% to $60.34. There is also a 1.25% deficit in LTC/BTC, bringing that ratio to 0.01489 BTC. These are still more than sufficient values to keep things above $60, although it remains to be seen what the future will bring for Bitcoin and alternative markets. Combined with $1.825bn in trading value, Litecoin is not in the worst of places whatsoever. Unfortunately, it remains unclear if the $60 level will act as support. The opinions on that front remain rather divided right now. When looking on social media, there is one new company accepting Litecoin as one of the many payment methods. More specifically, Track Smoke Shop in New Jersey now accepts both Bitcoin and Litecoin, which is a pretty interesting turn of events. Although this is another minor use case for these currencies, it shows some companies are still willing to take the plunge in terms of experimenting with cryptocurrency payments. For those traders who are looking at the current LTC chart, there are a few possible scenarios which can work out. First of all, there is the prediction by Inter X. This user expects the LTC/USD ratio will go on a bullish rampage fairly soon, although the current market momentum seems to oppose that idea. Even so, there has been a bit of an uptrend recently and it seems likely traders will try to improve upon that aspect in the days ahead. As is always the case, however, the Litecoin momentum will heavily rely on what happens to Bitcoin. As such, keeping a close eye on what Bitcoin does will be pretty crucial in this regard. The chart shared by Whale // Bitcoin // shows Bitcoin will probably continue its downward trend for some time to come, unless it can break through the resistance level near $4,015. As the weekend is just ahead, it seems unlikely BTC can remain above $4,000 for much longer, but one never knows what the future will hold. For the time being, the overall cryptocurrency market momentum seems to be rather uncertain. This minor bearish pressure isn\u2019t sufficient to get a lot of people worried, but it can prove very difficult to overcome throughout the day. Although there is no lack of trading volume as of right now, it would appear there is little reason to push the markets up in value again. For Litecoin, maintaining control of $60 will be the main priority, yet it is up to the individual market participants to make things happen. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While Bitcoin is clinging on to minute gains, it would appear the Factom price is turning bullish in a convincing manner. Although it is a bit unclear if this trend can be sustained for much longer, this momentum will please a lot of traders. It is always interesting to see how individual cryptocurrency markets evolve when the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is still trying to hit its stride. Even though Bitcoin seems to remain in the green for some time to come, it also becomes apparent other markets show a bigger desire to move up in quick succession. If Factom is any example, there will be a lot more positive market momentum to keep an eye on over the next few days. This market has seemingly engaged all cylinders in the past day, as the push to $7 seems to be in full effect. To put this price trend in perspective, Factom has gained 7.7% in both USD and BTC value alike. Due to these gains, the Factom price currently sits at $6.85, or 0.00167917 Bitcoin. Both levels are quite impressive, especially when considering how bearish most markets looked earlier this week. One worrisome aspect for Factom is how its trading volume is nearly non-existent. With just $500,697 in trades, sustaining this near $65m market cap will prove to be a challenge in its own right. Assuming this volume can be beefed up a bit, there isn\u2019t necessarily something to worry about as of yet. On social media, there is no lack of support for Factom at this time. In fact, Atom Ant is quite pleased with Factom\u2019s Harmony aspect. This technology can improve upon reviews, audits, and implementing blockchain capabilities. It is certainly something to look forward to in the future, although it remains to be seen how many companies and entrepreneurs will effectively make use of this particular technology in the years to come. For those who are looking at the price chart right now, Factom may offer a lot of interesting momentum moving forward. Endoryan has recently shared an interesting chart, although it appears a key resistance level will be coming up in the very near future. Assuming this resistance can be broken, things will undoubtedly look great for FCT. However, overcoming the key resistance levels will always be difficult for any cryptocurrency and blockchain project. Everything stands and falls with Bitcoin, after all. Genghis Khan Sperm Shot, who may have one of the more unique names on Twitter, currently looks at Factom as \u201chis baby\u201d. In terms of fundamentals, Factom is, in his opinion, on the same level as Bitcoin. Whether or not that makes it a prominent selling point for FCT, remains to be seen, as the opinions on Bitcoin are all over the place these days. Moreover, the recent rankings by the CCID in China seem to indicate Bitcoin is not the top project so many people expect it to be. As such, being on the same fundamental level may not necessarily be a big deal in the eyes of some. It is always difficult to predict how cryptocurrency markets will evolve at any given time. Although there is no lack of positive momentum to keep an eye on right now, it would appear Bitcoin may not remain near the current level for much longer. If that were to be the case, there is a chance the Factom value will come tumbling down again as well. The main question is whether or not this will occur before Factom hits $7.

As of right now, the Bitcoin price barely holds on to its gains, but it would appear that might not be the case for much longer. The EOS price is also going quite strong right now, as it seems to pile up the gains without too many problems. When Ethereum and XRP are starting to dip in the red, one would expect most alternative markets to follow suit pretty quickly. One notable exception in this regard is EOS, as this market seemingly knows nothing about bearish pressure at this time. Instead, it seems to be tricking along rather nicely, as its trading volume continues to provide plenty of support to ensure this market moves along. It is evident this type of momentum is somewhat surprising, although it is still in place as of right now. Over the past 24 hours, the EOS price has gained another 4.47% in USD value to push the price to $4.28. There is also a 4.28% gain in EOS/BTC, as that ratio now sits at 0.00104872 Bitcoin. A very interesting continuation of the earlier trend, primarily because it appeared the 0.001 BTC level would provide a lot more resistance in the coming days. For the time being, the $2.6bn in trading volume also seems to be doing its job quite well, On social media, there are a lot of people who like to point out the positive aspects of EOS more than anything else. Luke Stokes, for example, sees EOS as a validation of how open source and decentralized development should be done. Although most people will readily argue there are other decentralized and autonomous solutions on the market today, it would appear EOS is getting a lot of attention in this regard. When pump signal groups start to call for EOS shorting, one knows things will get pretty interesting moving forward. More specifically, the Twitter account below seems to indicate there will be some bearish pressure on EOS, although it seems that momentum hasn\u2019t come into play as of right now. There is always a chance the momentum will turn around in the near future, but for now, it seems unlikely this signal has any real merit to it whatsoever. Surprisingly, it would appear a fair few other users are also convinced EOS/BTC will hit a glass ceiling fairly soon. Klondike expects the bearish divergence, double tap, and RSI factor to come into play later today. However, the market seems to indicate there must be further upward momentum, thus it remains to be seen how things will evolve exactly. As the weekend looms ahead, anything can happen in this volatile industry. All of the signs seem to indicate there will be further upward momentum for EOS, albeit the traders and speculators have an entirely different opinion. Since it remains unclear how controls these markets exactly, the future price momentum can easily swing either way. For EOS, the reliance on Bitcoin has become less apparent, which is usually a very good sign. Considering how Bitcoin looks to turn pretty bearish again fairly soon, most of the market factors seem to work in favor of EOS at this time. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Not because they don\u2019t like an increase in value, but primarily because they expect a new wave of bearish pressure to materialize. For the time being, most of the top markets remain in the green without too many issues. The Ravencoin price is moving up swiftly once again, which seems to cap off its strong weekly run. When the Bitcoin trend tends to move up for a few days in a row, it seems the alternative markets will do the exact same. Ravencoin is no exception in this regard, primarily because it tends to benefit tremendously from bullish momentum. This has been apparent for quite some time now and it seems today will be no exception. Bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency industry is more than welcome, yet some markets trend to note massive gains in quick succession. Over the past 24 hours, the Ravencoin price has gained another 28.36% to push the USD value to $0.065748. In terms of RVN/BTC, there is a 27.54% increase, which brings that ratio to 1,615 Satoshi. Traders and holders will be quite pleased with all of these developments at this time, although it remains to be seen how long this can be sustained. While there is no reason for bearish pressure, it seems a lot of people will begin taking profits in the near future. On social media, there are plenty of debates regarding cryptocurrencies and Ravencoin in particular. The official Twitter account of the projects is looking for ways to keep improving the project in its own way. More specifically, they have posted a lot of ideas to offer better security, further layers of scaling and features, code peer review, et cetera. No bug bounty program is in place at this time, but that situation may come to change in the near future. Andy Sheu expects more bullish momentum for Ravencoin to materialize in the coming days. With the weekend just around the corner, there is always a chance things will continue to improve from here on out. However, this user would love to see RVN/USDT trading on the Binance exchange. While that is a commendable request, it seems rather unlikely the exchange will effectively add such a trading pair moving forward. Every cryptocurrency needs a good meme to keep its community engaged and happy. While Ravencoin isn\u2019t necessarily known for its memes, it seems there is a very interesting one making the rounds on social media right now. Ravens feasting on a dead bear is not an uncommon sight in the real world. It also aptly explains the current RVN market momentum, although it remains to be seen if this momentum can be sustained for very long. As Ravencoin continues its bullish run, there will be plenty of people who take good profit along the way. After all, a 28% increase in quick succession is pretty appealing for most traders, which is only normal. However, this market has been subject to a desire to set a new all-time high. As that value is now officially reached at $0.065748, it will be interesting to see what comes next for this particular market. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Whereas some of the most promising darknet markets were shut down in the past few years, things have gone rather quiet in the scene. However, it now seems Dream Market will shut down at the end of April. This appears to coincide with a recent raid by Europol, as the agency arrested multiple individuals this week. One of the main reason why darknet markets matter to cryptocurrency enthusiasts is because Bitcoin and select altcoins are the preferred payment methods. On the one hand, this will give cryptocurrencies a very bad reputation, as has become apparent in recent years. However, the other side of the medallion is how there is an increase in global cryptocurrency usage, which should benefit the ecosystem in the long run. That latter aspect may become less prevalent, as numerous marketplaces have been shut down in the past half decade. Whereas darknet markets were once thriving and popping up in every corner of the world, the landscape has changed significantly. All of the top marketplaces are long gone by now, and Dream Market was the only bastion still standing. Sadly for its users, that will not be the case for much longer. On its website, the team has confirmed Dream Market will shut down on April 30, 20198. The message also states how all services will be transferred to a partner company, which means the concept of Dream Market will live on as a new darknet marketplace. What is always worrisome when such messages are shared, is whether or not the \u201cnew\u201d platform is trustworthy. For all one knows, this could be a message put up by Europol after seizing control of the Dream market Onion domain. Creating honey traps for darknet vendors and customers is nothing new in this industry. In fact, it is a rather common tactic which tends to yield in multiple arrests over the course of many years to come. For now, it remains to be determined how legitimate this \u201cpartner company\u201d will prove to be. To make matters even more interesting, Europol has recently confirmed several individuals have been arrested. All of these users are linked to darknet activity, which could indicate Dream Market has been a target of this agency for some time now. While there is no official mention of this top marketplace in the report itself, the timing seems a bit too convenient to indicate otherwise. During the Europol raid, conducted with the help of the FBI, DEA, and Canadian police forces, plenty of drugs, weapons, and cryptocurrency were seized in the process. When Dream Market will shut down in about a month from now, a lot of darknet users will have to look for a new home. While the partner company could be an outlet to keep an eye on, there are plenty of concerns as of how this platform should not be trusted. It is rather uncommon for a top market to refer to any alternatives. As such, it seems caution is more than warranted at this time. Hansa, another top market which was shut down a while ago, went through a somewhat similar procedure. How this new development will affect the cryptocurrency scene, is difficult to predict. Fewer outlets to give Bitcoin and altcoins a terrible reputation is a good sign, but it will also make this form of money less \u201cuseful\u201d to a lot of people. It seems likely to assume a fair few new darknet marketplaces will pop up in the near future where Bitcoin and other similar currencies are welcomed with open arms. One also has to commend Europol for trying to make the internet a slightly safer space, even though these agencies are fighting an uphill battle first and foremost.", "date": "2019-03-28T09:16:52+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 28}

Although the current top markets show an entirely different trend, not all of them are effectively gaining value over Bitcoin itself. Despite some promising XRP price momentum, it is still struggling in the BTC value department right now. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it can cause some unrest as well. When the top markets all decide to turn bullish in very quick succession, one has to keep in mind things will not necessarily be green across the board. There is a very big difference between noting gains in USD and BTC value. Although both trends can materialize at the exact same time, it doesn\u2019t necessarily happen all that often either. Especially where XRP is concerned, it would appear the XRP/BTC gains will be a bit more difficult to come by these days. Over the past 24 hours, this odd and unusual trend becomes all the more apparent. While the XRP Price gained 2.36% in USD value, it lost 0.25% in BTC value once again. This brings the current XRP ratio to 7,597 Satoshi, or $0.308635. While some traders still have high hopes to see XRP return to 8,000 Satoshi at one point or another, it seems unlikely that will be the case in the near future. For some users, this can be rather problematic, although it is entirely to be expected as well. On social media, it would appear Huobi has big plans for XRP in the near future. More specifically, the company has confirmed there will be XRP contract son Huobi DM in the very near future. It is another way of bringing more potential liquidity to this market, albeit it may not necessarily affect the XRP value in any significant manner. Rest assured it will certainly spark some initial excitement, but from a long-term perspective, there might not be too much interest. When it comes to looking at the actual price chart, rather interesting momentum appears to be shaping up. XRP will, just like all other top markets, rely on Bitcoin\u2019s price momentum first and foremost. Right now, that price trend doesn\u2019t look too promising by any means, although one never knows what may come next for Bitcoin. In terms of XRP/BTC, however, a head-and-shoulder pattern appears to be forming, which can always yield some interesting price changes in the near future. GameOfCrypto seems to maintain a very bearish outlook where both XRP and Bitcoin are concerned. To put this in perspective, the user expects Bitcoin to crumble and retrace in a rather violent manner. While that is certainly a distinct possibility, it remains to be seen if and when that particular trend will materialize. A bearish Bitcoin trend certainly won\u2019t do XRP any real favors, although it seems this current uptrend has some legs to it. Everything in the cryptocurrency needs to be taken in stride. While it is evident there is plenty of minor bullish momentum forming right now, it appears that situation may change pretty soon. Most markets note somewhat bearish hourly candles as the afternoon began, this it seems likely some pressure will occur before the week is over. What that means exactly for XRP, is a different matter altogether. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

Although there is always some concern as to whether or not this trend will last very long, it seems most markets are making the best of it right now. The Binance Coin price is trying to move up in a decisive fashion, although it lags behind a few other top markets as of right now. A lot of traders seemed oddly surprised to learn even Binance Coin would suffer from the bearish momentum affecting all other markets over the weekend and throughout Monday. While it is true BNB tends to do things a bit differently from the rest of the markets, one has to keep in mind it too tends to follow Bitcoin in good or bad times. Ever since Bitcoin decided to move up once again, it seems Binance Coin has taken that lead by example. Over the past 24 hours, the Binance Coin price has noted a 4.76% gain in USD value to bring the price back to $16.87. There is also a 2.07% increase in BNB/BTC and a 0.97% improvement in BNB/ETH. All of these signs are very promising for BNB holders and speculators, although it remains to be seen if they can all be sustained in the long run. There is nothing wrong with Binance Coin at this point, although there is some dismay on social media regarding the current course of action. It would appear there are a few interesting developments on the horizon for BNB. Although this token is primarily linked to the Binance exchange, there is also some interest by other exchanges to provide access to BNB. Bitsten, while a rather unknown project, has confirmed they will list Binance Coin in the next few days. While it may not necessarily result in any major price changes, more liquidity is always a good thing. Another exchange, known as Ice3x, will enable a Binance Coin trading pair against the South African Rand. A very interesting development, primarily because the South African market could prove to be very interesting for all currencies, tokens, and assets alike. While some users expected Ice3x to not list utility tokens, it would appear things are progressing in an interesting direction as of late. Regardless of the exchange listing news, it would appear most people primarily care about the BNB chart. That is only normal, as this industry is popular primarily because people want to make good money. RektCapital expects more upside for Binance Coin, even though the claims of how BNB made a new ATH is factually incorrect. The actual ATH for BNB is $24.46, a value which hasn\u2019t been reached since early 2018. It seems unlikely that price level will be achieved again in the near future, although that will primarily depend on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum. All of the current BNB price momentum looks promising, especially to those who want to get in and out quickly for some easy profits. Those who prefer the long-term game, it remains to be seen where things will stand in a few months from today. The bear market is still not over at this point, thus there is a good chance the market will retrace again in the very near future. When that will happen and how dire things could get, is a big mystery. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

That is not entirely unlikely, as this is an odd time of day to trade cryptocurrencies. The BitTorrent Token price is trying to hold on to its minor gains, yet it seems unlikely this market won\u2019t dip in the red later today. However, the wave of positive news may help keep this market afloat for a little while longer. It is evident all of the alternative markets are on edge right now. More specifically, the promising Bitcoin price trend hasn\u2019t necessarily remained in place. Although those gains have not been lost, continuing the uptrend has proven to be extremely difficult, if not impossible. As the hype and excitement ebb away, it seems the altcoins, tokens, and assets will turn bearish again as well. BitTorrent Token is one example, although there are many different developments taking place behind the scenes. Over the past 24 hours, the BitTorrent Token price has gained 1.12% in USD value, 0.57% over Bitcoin, and 0.85% in Ether value. Although this is still a very promising trend first and foremost, the overall trading volume will not be sufficient to keep things going for much longer. As such, the current BTT price of $0.000778, or 19 Satoshi, could collapse at any given time. However, the news involving BTT can easily put a different spin on this on this market moving forward. The first development to take note of is how BitTorrent Live has been announced. It is a new live streaming application making use of BitTorrent technology. It will also serve as a social media platform, of which there are already dozens in the world today. Assuming this project can deliver upon the promised \u201cnew content experience\u201d, it may bring a lot of positive attention to BitTorrent Token moving forward. Secondly, there is the announcement regarding BitTorrent Speed. It is advertised as \u201cthe largest blockchain application powered by BitTorrent\u201d. A very interesting way of phrasing it, primarily because it will be released in Q2 of 2019. This means its release can occur anywhere between next Monday and the final day of June. It is something to look forward to as well, albeit it may not impact the BTT value in any significant way. For the traders, all that matters is the BTT chart and where it will move next. While it looks as if this market has seen better days, there is still a long way ahead to reach its previous all-time high. In fact, this particular market has seen nothing but a slow and steady downfall ever since it was launched on exchanges, which is not all that promising. However, one could also argue things can only get better from here on out. For the time being, it remains to be seen what the future will hold for BitTorrent Token and the other alternative markets. As BTT was introduced, people got hyped, yet the project has not delivered on that initial promise. The recently announced developments, however, may effectively change that situation moving forward. If these services can be launched in time and effectively deliver on their promise, there is a chance the BTT value will respond in kind. If and when that will happen, is a different matter altogether. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

A lot of traders remain unconvinced things will not remain this positive for very long, which is only normal at this time. As far as the Tron price is concerned, there is nothing to be overly concerned about at this time. As the price surpasses $0.0234 again, the main question becomes whether or not this market can hit the 600 Satoshi level once again. It is always interesting to keep tabs on individual cryptocurrency markets when the momentum turns bullish for at least a full day. There will always be markets which impress a lot more traders than others, but the overall uptrend appears to be firmly in place as of right now. For Tron, the current price outlook pretty interesting, all things considering, although some traders would have expected a lot more momentum to materialize at this time. Over the past 24 hours, the final tally for Tron is how the value moved up by 5.17% in USD value and 1.89% in BTC value. Both of these trends are pretty interesting to keep an eye on, as they push the Tron price to $0.023467, or 577 Satoshi. As is to be expected the TRX/BTC uptrend is a bit slower compared to the USD gains, but it may be a matter of time until that situation rectifies itself. The big news of the week so far is how Justin Sun has confirmed the very first winner of the USDT-TRON car giveaway has been selected. Although her public information remains a bit unclear, it appears she will receive a brand new Mini Cooper. This also means the Tesla giveaway is still ongoing at this time, thus interested parties can still participate at this time. Given the high amount of fake followers Sun allegedly has, one can only hope this giveaway is genuine. As is to be expected, most people are interested in the Tron chart for profit purposes. Justfive is still uncertain as to what will happen next for TRX, as the uptrend has not been confirmed at this time. This minor positive momentum can easily be negated, primarily because the overall trading volume doesn\u2019t look too impressive at this time. The big question is why or how Binance would confirm the legitimacy of this uptrend, as waiting for that kind of signal is usually a point of concern. Purple Squid Crypto, on the other hand, seems to have bought TRX without knowing how this market will evolve. It is certainly possible there will be a major uptrend in the near future, although that will primarily depend on what happens to Bitcoin in the coming days and weeks. Assuming Bitcoin remains in the green, the momentum should bode well for alternative markets such as Tron as well. For the time being, it remains to be seen how the TRX/BTC ratio will evolve in the coming hours. Assuming this ratio doesn\u2019t break the 600 Satoshi resistance level, there could very well be a minor dip in USD value as well. It seems unlikely Bitcoin will move too much higher in the coming days, and some traders still expect a drop to $2,500. If that latter vision were to come true, there is a chance TRX will drop below $0.02 fairly quickly. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

That in itself is a big surprise, but also a welcome one. As the markets begin to look healthy again, traders seem excited about what will come next. The Litecoin price has climbed above $60 again and seeks to resume its bullish trend in quick succession. It is quite interesting to see how the cryptocurrency momentum is still in place as of right now. After a few rough days, yesterday\u2019s uptrend took a lot of people by surprise. As such, there was some concern as to whether or not there would be a retrace this morning, yet that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case as of yet. If Litecoin is any indication, things can get pretty interesting moving forward, although there is a limit as to how high these markets can go in the process. As far as the Litecoin price itself is concerned, there is a healthy 3.15% uptrend in USD value to take note of. However, there is just a 0.54% gain in LTC/BTC, which is slightly worrisome. It may take some time for altcoins to hit their stride in terms of potential BTC gains. Even so, LTC is doing a good job, as it currently sits at $60.9, or 0.01503 Bitcoin. It will be interesting to see how much upward potential there is left throughout the day once this day is over, as there is still some uneasy on the markets. When looking across social media, it would appear it is pertinent to keep the past in mind as well. More specifically, if people purchased Litecoin at the time of launch \u2013 or when it first hit exchanges \u2013 they would be up by 1,316% at this time. A very strong showing of increasing value, even after going through a hellacious bearish market trend for some time. It is certainly possible this percentage will continue to increase. Most traders only look at the short-term gains or losses, but the long-term perspective still looks pretty good, all things considered. There are always those people who think these are the early days in terms of profit potential. While there is certainly a case to be made in this regard, expecting Litecoin to hit $250 again seems a bit overly optimistic. However, It is certainly possible such a trend would occur, primarily because all of the markets show a keen desire to keep moving up. Only time will tell if that is even remotely possible under these circumstances. The bear market still isn\u2019t over by any means, thus caution remains advised. LitetheWorld is looking for ways to make money with Litecoin in whatever way possible. As such, he would even go as far as shorting or dumping Bitcoin SV if it would allow this trader to accumulate even more Litecoin in the process. A bit of an interesting approach, although the sentiment toward Bitcoin SV has soured significantly in recent weeks. Litecoin should be capable of doing fine on its own without people actively manipulating other markets, though. As these Litecoin gains look incredibly promising, it remains to be seen what the future will bring exactly. As long as Bitcoin remains in the green, it seems rather likely the alternative markets will do so as well. Litecoin, while not necessarily too reliant on Bitcoin, will continue to enjoy this positive momentum in its own way. Carving out improvements in LTC/BTC, however, may prove to be rather difficult at this time. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

The top markets remain subdued and there is no real enthusiasm among traders to speak of. For the XRP price, it remains to be seen if and when the price will drop below $0.30. The current mounting pressure seems to indicate this is merely a matter of time. Under normal circumstances, one wouldn\u2019t expect XRP to follow Bitcoin\u2019s negative trend so blindly. This time around has proven to be very different in that regard, although it remains a big mystery as to why this is happening as of right now. While the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency remains bearish first and foremost, it seems the other markets will face their own share of bearish pressure for some time to come. That in itself is not what traders and speculators have hoped for, but it seems unlikely anything will change in the foreseeable future. Over the past 24 hours, the XRP price has lost another 2.24% in USD value to drop down to $0.301. There is another 0.31% loss in XRP/BTC, which pushes that ratio down to 7m642 Satoshi. Not entirely surprising where this latter development as concerned. However, it also confirms the 8,000 Satoshi level is well out of reach for this popular asset as of right now, which will displease a lot of holders. A drop to 7,500 Satoshi seems rather plausible at this point, although there is no real indication as to how the markets will evolve exactly. When looking across social media, it seems there are a lot of different opinions regarding XRP and Ripple. Cryptoguru075 expects there to be a lot of bearish pressure moving forward. Claiming Ripple hasn\u2019t released any news for a full year might be a bit of a stretch, though, There have been quite a few key developments, although it remains to be seen if there can be any meaningful impact for XRP in the process. Berite is speculating how exchanges might be dumping their XRP all of a sudden. It is remarkable to see someone openly name Binance in this regard, even though there is zero indication that company \u2013 or any other \u2013 is effectively liquidating XRP. There wouldn\u2019t be any reason for doing so either, as XRP is simply following Bitcoin\u2019s bumpy trend as of right now. No manipulation appears to be taking place, especially with such bleak trading volume. It is uncanny what traders come up with when the momentum remains bearish for more than a few hours. This tweet has been deleted ever since it was first pointed out, unfortunately. For those who are mainly interested in the actual price chart, it is evident the coming hours will prove to be crucial in many different ways. If the trendline is broken, there may very well be a drop to $0.28 or slightly lower in the coming days. Most of this will depend on what happens to Bitcoin first and foremost, as that market dictates the overall momentum. For XRP, things simply are not looking great, unfortunately. All of the market momentum seems to confirm there will be even further bearish pressure across all markets. While traders will not like this in the slightest, there is no remote indication things will turn around on a dime. Hourly candles still remain bearish for all top markets, which only further confirms the bear market is not over. How low all of these markets will go in the coming hours and days, remains to be determined. Anything is possible in this industry. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While that is a rather promising turn of events, it will take some time for all of the alternative markets to regain lost ground. The Basic Attention Token price is on the right track already, as it is trying to push through to $0.22 once again. When the Bitcoin price turned bearish nearly two days ago, alternative markets were quick to follow suit. That is only normal, as most of these offerings directly derive value from the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency. Basic Attention Token has tried to remain in the green all that time and is now the first to note major gains. It is evident the push to $0.22 is in full effect, assuming this uptrend proves sustainable. When tallying up the past 24 hours, the Basic Attention Token price gained over 8.1% in USD value to rise to $0.217. There is also a 7.6% increase in BAT/BTC and BAT/ETH, which is always promising to keep an eye on. Combined with $22.67m in trading volume, there should be no retrace in the near future. However, volatile markets will always be unpredictable first and foremost. It is evident a lot of traders have high expectations for Basic Attention Token. DaoCoinTech, for example, sees a double peak and negative mismatch on the daily chart. Whether or not that means this uptrend will fall apart, is always a bit of a difficult question. The current momentum seems to indicate BAT is in a good flow, although one never knows what the next few hours will bring. BitcoinBanksy has seemingly turned bullish when it comes to the favorite altcoins and tokens on the market. While it is true some markets perform a lot better under bearish conditions compared to others, there will be a time when this train of thought no longer applies. When that will happen exactly, remains to be seen, but it is evident Basic Attention Token will not engage the pumps every time Bitcoin goes in the red. Last but not least, there is the tweet by Philosof which points an interesting picture. This chart clearly shows how pump-and-dump-like this market can be on the best of days. If history were to repeat itself, there will be another steep downtrend fairly soon, as these gains have not been sustained successfully all week long. Either that, or a major breakout will occur. When taking everything into consideration, it would appear Basic Attention Token can be an interesting market for onlookers. Those who have skin in the game may grow a bit more nervous as time progresses, as this market will undergo changes either for better or worse.

It seems unlikely DigiByte will be the coin to do so, as its value is tanking quite hard for some unknown reason. As the DigiByte price losses continue to pile up, there\u2019s a chance DGB will drop below 300 Satoshi fairly soon. Although altcoins will usually bleed value when Bitcoin turns bearish for quite some time, the current losses for DigiByte might not necessarily make the most sense either. Its losses are a lot steeper compared to nearly all other markets in the top 50, which will worry quite a few holders, speculators, and traders alike. For the time being, it remains to be seen what the future will hold for DGB, although one never knows how bearish or bullish things will get in the next few hours and days. For the time being, the DigiByte price remains subjected to increasing bearish pressure. With a 14.4% loss in USD value and a 12.85% loss over Bitcoin, one DGB is now valued at $0.012268, or 311 Satoshi. Neither level is impressive by any means, although one would expect some of these losses to be negated fairly quickly. With just $1.3m in trading volume, however, that might not necessarily occur anytime soon. Traders have cooled off on DGB at this time, which is in line with other markets. On social media, there is still some hype surrounding DigiByte at this time. Stephen Kendal, for example, is quite pleased about DGB being represented during Coin Fest UK. The next event will occur in Manchester next week. Without the help of Bullex, that showcase would not be possible, by the look of things. There is still a lot going on behind the scenes of DigiByte, even if the price seems to tell a different story. Other community members also do their part to spread the word about this altcoin and blockchain project. RedTekno shared a very interesting infographic highlighting all of the upsides to DigiByte. One would almost forget this currency has been around for over four years, which is something very few altcoins can achieve in this day and age. While DGB may have a lot of facets working in its favor these days, it seems Bitcoin will remain the dominant currency for quite some to come. There is also some dismay regarding a recent tweet by Coinbase Custody. As Kyber Network was added to this platform, it seems a lot of DGB community members were disappointed DigiByte hasn\u2019t been supported as of yet. While it is evident Coinbase Custody is going through the motions of supporting as many tokens, assets, and currencies as possible, they can\u2019t work miracles either. For now, DGB enthusiasts will have to bide their time like everyone else. When all of the top markets remain bearish for more than a few days on end, it is normal altcoins will start to retrace in quick succession. DigiByte is no exception in this regard, although things could still get a lot worse from here on out. That is not necessarily something to look forward to, as there is a genuine chance the DigiByte value will drop below 300 Satoshi if this trend continues for a few more days.

However, it is a bit odd to see certain markets shoot up by over 10% as if there were no bear market in the past few days. Regardless of that train of thought, the EOS price seems to be moving up in a decisive manner once again. Surpassing $4 again is the first major milestone to be achieved. When Bitcoin starts to regain its feet, all of the altcoins will usually follow that example to some degree. Certain markets will be less bullish, whereas other swills imply engage the pumps and begin firing on all cylinders right away. As of right now, EOS seems to fall into the latter category, as it is noting very strong gains in relatively quick succession already. This is visible across both USD and BTC alike, which will only further fuel speculation as to how high this market cap can rise in the process. Over the past 24 hours, the EOS price has noted a strong 11.5% gain in USD value, pushing the price to $4.08. There is also a prominent increase in EOS/BTC following an 8.96% improvement. bringing the ratio back to 0.001 Bitcoin. These are very impressive trends, primarily facilitated by $2.542bn in trades. Everything seems to indicate this particular market will continue to move up throughout the day, although such strong gains are usually met with some form of correction sooner or later. When looking across social media, there is a lot to get excited about as well for EOS. First of all, there are some big announcements coming to EOS in the near future which will be of great interest to developers and community members alike. Any cryptocurrency and blockchain project needs constant improvements to keep moving ahead, and this particular offering is no different. It remains to be seen if this will affect the market in any significant manner, as that is a completely different story. The recently released Weiss Ratings seem to confirm EOS is still in the lead when it comes to global public blockchain solutions. Although the report does contain some minor factual errors, according to Jason Deane, the overall sentiment seems to indicate EOS is well ahead of most other projects available on the market today. While this report carries some weight, it remains to be determined whether or not there will be any real impact on the value because of it. EOS New York, one of the many Block producers who make up this ecosystem, has recently noted how EOS has come up on top in virtually all of the major rankings these days. Additionally, some of the projects which have collaborations with EOS are also getting a lot of attention lately, While these developments are very promising first and foremost, it is evident the competing projects will put up a fight in the coming weeks and months. Traders are getting very excited when it comes to EOS, especially when such strong gains can be noted in quick succession without too many problems. However, there is a good chance this momentum will be halted sooner or later, as a lot of people will try to cash out profits early and often until the bull market is effectively confirmed to be in place. Right now, that is not the case whatsoever, as Bitcoin\u2019s run is still on very shaky foundations right now. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Until that happens, this extensive bearish trend will need to be endured, unfortunately. When even the Binance Coin price is going down in value, one has to acknowledge this is not the best of times for this industry. When looking at the big picture in terms of overall crypto market momentum, it is only normal to see all currencies, tokens, and assets in the red. That is except the coins which are going through what appears to be a pump cycle. Binance Coin is, for once not rising in value when Bitcoin\u2019s value is in the red. That seems to confirm this token\u2019s trend may have run its course, for a little while. Over the past 24 hours, the Binance Coin price momentum has soured significantly. While some people may claim this coin will gain another 100% fairly soon, the current balance looks a bit different. A 2.76% loss in USD follow and 1.2% losses over both Bitcoin and Ethereum do not paint a happy picture. While the current value still sits above $16.5, it remains to be seen how much longer that will be the case. Even Weiss Ratings is seemingly growing tired of the BNB price surges which seemingly make little to no sense. They confirmed the Launchpad changes have been beneficial to this price trend, although it also fuels the speculation as to how this price run is artificial first and foremost. It is always interesting to see these different opinions on such changes. A similar sentiment is echoed by CryptoAndChill. This user sees the current BNB model as a way to create more accredited investors, instead of opening up token sales to the masses like originally intended. It is not a business model most people will agree with, and one that can harm the BNB price in the distant future. Comments like these should not be overlooked by any means, as they show people are getting tired of how things are being run. Adam, on the other hand, is concerned over the number of use cases for Binance Coin now and in the future. It is mainly focused on the Binance exchange, although Travala accepts it as well. Even so, without additional utility, and the potential outcome of cutting out smaller investors, the current price seems unsustainable for the long run. A lot of the positive momentum is turning against this market in recent days, which isn\u2019t entirely unexpected. While the current momentum seems to indicate the Binance Coin value will recover fairly soon, the overall sentiment among community members shows something else entirely. It is certainly possible this market will see another uptrend materialize at some point, but the growing dismay among holders and onlookers does not bode well. Addressing those concerns may prove crucial for the future of BNB. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

With Bitcoin still down by nearly 2%, it would appear nothing exciting will happen today either. Even though the Ontology price has been rather bullish over the past week and a half, it seems most of that momentum is being eroded in very quick succession. It was a matter of time until the value of Ontology would come crashing down once again. As this market has seen some very big gains in recent weeks, one would expect a correction to occur fairly soon. It now seems that price correction is kicking in, and is making some very volatile waves in the process. It seems rather likely the ONT value will drop below $1.1 pretty quickly if this trend remains in place. The current tally for Ontology is not exactly promising by any means. A 9% drop in USD value and a 7.17% decrease in ONT/BTC do not paint a positive picture by any stretch of the imagination. These declines drive the Ontology price down to $1.14, or 28,945 Satoshi. Its overall trading volume is still doing quite well, although the $70.65m is not necessarily sufficient to turn this ship around now or in the near future. It is evident Bitcoin\u2019s trend affects all alternative markets in a bearish manner. On social media, it would appear there is still some excitement surrounding Ontology. More specifically, the project itself is tweeting about the TOP airdrop which is occurring later today. Users can still enter to win a few tokens, but it is evident this is not the momentum traders will be looking for. However, it can bring some positive attention to ONT as well, as the Top Network is an Ontology incubated project. For those who are primarily looking at the current ONT chart, it seems things will not necessarily improve moving forward. More specifically, the current pattern shows there is still a wedge in play which seems to lean toward further bearish pressure waiting to materialize. Assuming that is the case, double-digit percentage losses are on the horizon for Ontology, which is in line with what other markets are going through right now. Traders and speculators who just want to make some good money during this time can look into triangular arbitrage opportunities. One of those options involves the use of Ontology to pocket a potential profit of up to 92%, which almost sounds too good to be true. The involvement of BitBns is, once again, the weak link in this process, but one never knows what this intra-exchange trade can offer in the end. Making money in this industry requires taking a few risks. All of these signs seem to confirm the cryptocurrency industry is not in a good place right now. While that situation may change in the near future, it seems Ontology will not really much of an uptrend moving forward. That will only happen if Bitcoin decides to move up in quick succession, which seems very unlikely at this time. Why this bearish momentum is still in place right now, remains a big mystery to pretty much everyone. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

No market in the top 15 is noting gains except for the EOS price. While the uptrend is minimal at best, the market still clings to these small gains like there is no tomorrow. When the top cryptocurrencies remain bearish for nearly two full days in a row, a lot of unrest is triggered among investors and speculators. That is a rather normal turn of events, as the current outlook is anything but positive. For EOS, the current pressure is bothersome as well, albeit not necessarily definitive. It is one of the few markets to note an uptrend in BTC value, which is rather remarkable. Over the past 24 hours, the EOS price has risen by 0.17% to $3.65. This has proven to be a solid support level, although a minor pullback seems all but inevitable at this time. What is more intriguing is how EOS/BTC went up by 1.88% during this latest bearish trend. With a value of 92.625 Satoshi, it would appear EOS is doing a lot better than most alternative markets available today. Although there seemingly isn\u2019t much to get excited about, keeping tabs on the latest EOS developments is always a good idea. The latest edition of EOS Echo offers a lot of information, ranging from Eosfinex to Loom Network and Bancor\u2019s new unified wallet. It is a good source for weekly updates and developments, as there seems to be a lot going on behind the scenes of this project. Looking beyond the news, it seems traders are not too confident where this current price trend is concerned. CryptoNail expects a major resistance level to drive down the EOS value in the hours to come. While EOS is not necessarily following Bitcoin\u2019s price pattern by any means, it is only normal some correlation will occur sooner or later. A very similar bearish outlook is shared by Nico, who expects a somewhat interesting price shift to occur fairly soon. Although there are some bullish signs, Bitcoin is leading this dance one way or another. As such, it is only normal caution is warranted at this time, primarily because Bitcoin\u2019s momentum remains uncertain and indecisive. Changing that scenario will not necessarily happen overnight, by the look of things For the time being, it remains to be seen if this EOS/BTC ratio can be sustained or even improved upon further. I that is not the case, the USD losses will become apparent fairly quickly, as Bitcoin looks to drop even further overnight. An EOS value of $3.5 or lower seems rather unlikely, although it will primarily depend on whether the $3.6 level can act as solid support. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

For the time being, it seems none of the top markets show much interest in moving up again. Even the Stellar price is still down by roughly 2%, even though there are some interesting developments behind the scenes. For those people who keep a close eye on the various crypto, token, and asset markets, it quickly becomes apparent there is plenty of exciting momentum behind the scenes of most markets. On the surface, the prices are not necessarily following these developments to a T. Stellar is a good example in that regard. While there are some key partnerships being forged as of late, the XLM value is not responding in kind just yet. The next balance for the Stellar price is a 1.88% decrease in USD value and a 2.08% loss over Bitcoin. Neither of these trends is particularly worrisome either, but they do confirm the bear market is far from over at this point. While Stellar\u2019s trading volume is also pretty weak, that is to be expected following a rather volatile weekend. The $0.105 price level has not come under any real pressure as of yet, but it remains to be seen if that will remain to be the case for much longer. It appears a lot of traders have high expectations for XLM moving forward. Nick V sees the current momentum as an opportunity to pocket some gains. While it is commendable to see traders predict a bounce will occur for XLM, these markets often tend to respond in rather funny ways. As such, this trend may not necessarily materialize as expected, although anything remains possible at any given time. For now, it seems likely a small bounce could occur later in the day. Traders who are not too keen on waiting for any further downtrend or a potential uptrend can always explore arbitrage opportunities. There are two direct arbitrage options to explore. A price gap between either Binance or Kraken and Bitexen can yield speculators a potential profit of up to 1.28%. Not the most spectacular gains by any means, but it seems to be sufficient to make some people look into these options a bit more. All of these exchanges should offer sufficient liquidity to make interesting things happen. There is also a triangular arbitrage option which can yield a much higher potential profit. More specifically, it would yield a potential profit of up to 95%, although that does require using multiple exchanges and trading pairs. Especially the final step of selling on Bitbns can be of concern, but there are some minor profits to be pocketed along the way as well. XLM is involved in these trades, which shows the price difference between trading platforms are worth keeping an eye on. For the time being, it remains a bit unclear how all of the top crypto markets will evolve throughout the day. Although Bitcoin seems to be digging itself out of a hole, there is still no decisive course of action to speak of. That usually doesn\u2019t bode well for alternative markets like Stellar, although it seems the losses are being recuperated slowly and steadily. A push to $0.11 is not entirely unlikely, although no one should expect any immediate miracles either. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Of the top 20 projects ranked by market cap, 17 of them are in the red at this time. The Tron price is still under a lot of pressure these days, even though most traders expected something else entirely. It will be interesting to see what comes next, yet an uptrend seems very far away under these conditions. It is evident the momentum keeping Bitcoin in a very tight grip doesn\u2019t bode well for all alternative markets. While no one will be surprised by this particular development, it is a very annoying aspect to deal with. Regardless of how altcoin, token, or asset ecosystems might be evolving, they will not see any positive price momentum if Bitcoin isn\u2019t up for it either. Tron makes for a good example in this regard, as its behind-the-scenes developments are potentially interesting. However, the TRX price is still piling up the losses at this time. Over the past 24 hours, the Tron price lost 2.8% across the board. Its USD value currently sits at $0.023155, or 577 Satoshi. It will be difficult for TRX to regain the 600 Satoshi level in a convincing manner, although nothing is impossible in this peculiar industry. As the trading volume starts picking up again, there could always be some unexpected and interesting changes looming on the horizon. For now, however, the downtrend will most likely remain in place throughout the remainder of the day. In terms of ecosystem development, things are looking pretty interesting for Tron. Its dApp ecosystem continues to grow, as this project notes more new user acquisitions compared to EOS and Ethereum alike. Although this is not entirely a surprise either, it would appear there will be some excitement regarding this most recent development. So far, it does not appear to impact the TRX value in a significant manner, though. In more exciting news, it would appear eToro has decided to introduce Tron support. Although the company tends to support many different currencies, assets, and tokens, Tron was notably absent from its list. That situation has now been rectified. While some TRX community members are excited, claiming how this altcoin will make its way to the NYSE or S&P 500 seems rather worrisome. Such developments will not occur for any cryptocurrency, token, or asset in the near future. There is also quite some buzz regarding the Tether stablecoin coming to the Tron blockchain. Until that happens, there is a new USDT-TRX pair to keep traders engaged for the foreseeable future. TRXMarket, a decentralized exchange based on Tron technology without trading fees, has added this particular trading pair over the weekend. How popular it will prove to be, is difficult to predict. It is a welcome development for the Tron ecosystem as a whole, though, as more trading pairs and USDT exposure is never a bad thing. All of the market signs seem to indicate the bearish pressure will make its presence felt throughout the day. That is never something to look forward to, albeit it is not easy to stave off the inevitable either. Until Bitcoin starts to shift gears in a positive manner again, it seems extremely unlikely Tron will see any price gains in its own regard.

Information counts and getting that information to the consumer in such a way that is easily understood is vital. Today, most know a certain amount about Bitcoin, whether that has been gleaned off the internet or read in the daily newspapers, but it is still surprising just how many consumers still do not realise how beneficial it is, especially in today\u2019s social climate where divulging personal details is frowned upon by many. Just like paying for your online casino games using your monthly phone contract or pay-as-you-go-account, Bitcoin releases consumers from the worry of identity fraud and other, online crimes. Bitcoin provides a decentralised way to pay for services and goods with no ties to any financial institution or government and this means for the consumer that all transactions can be completed faster and more securely than other, conventional ways of paying. Paying for goods and services using bitcoin is also completely anonymous. Although many people have heard of and know a little about bitcoin it seems that fewer are aware of what Blockchain is, and what it provides. Since its conception Blockchain has evolved and grown allowing digital information to be distributed, yet importantly, not copied, and today the tech community is finding other potentials for the technology other than crypto-currency. Not only can blockchain be programmed to record financial transaction but practically everything of value can also be recorded, which means that the web as we currently know it could easily gain a new layer of functionality. Blockchain brings extra security which could mean that new businesses operating on the internet would be able to rid themselves of the traditional institution of finance.

While Bitcoin is still in uncertain waters, it would appear the IOTA price is struggling significantly. At this time, it is a bit unlikely what is driving this downtrend, although there may be further losses up ahead. While Bitcoin is not necessarily impressing cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors by any means, there is nothing to be overly concerned about either at this time. Unfortunately for the alternative markets, weak Bitcoin momentum will usually result in some very awkward momentum for these altcoins as well. As far as IOTA is concerned, things are not looking too great right now, primarily because the downtrend is visible all across the board. Over the past 24 hours, the current IOTA price trend is not overly promising by any means. With a net 2.95% loss in both USD and BTC value, it is evident things are not looking too great right now. This recent downtrend drives the value down to $0.3049, or 7,582 Satoshi. While most holders and investors will not be overly concerned by that particular trend, it may very well be a sign of what is yet to come in the near future. Assuming that is the case, the $0.3 level will not hold for very long. Despite the current price pressure, most IOTA enthusiasts are not too concerned about what is going on. There are still a lot of developments taking place behind the scenes which spell an interesting future for this particular project. As Chris Mueller explains, there is a lot of focus on Fognet and other developments making use of IOTA technology in one way or another. According to some sources, it seems some of the IOTA team members also made their presence known during a recent OMG blockchain event. As there was an active discussion regarding the use of IOTA technology on an international level and creating potential standards, there is something to look forward to. There is no official timeline as to when such standards would be created, although there is always a chance things could evolve a lot faster than anticipated. There is also a very peculiar albeit interesting Tweet by Value-Investor. Although not everyone will agree with this user, he does touch upon an important point. More specifically, he expects IoT solutions will see a big growth courtesy of various cryptocurrency projects. However, the likes of IOTA will not necessarily be used for more mainstream transactions. It will be interesting to see if this vision comes to fruition, as anything is possible. For the time being, it seems unlikely IOTA will mount a strong comeback anytime soon. Although the market is not in the worst of places as of right now, the bearish pressure may not necessarily relent anytime soon either. These losses are quite steep and the overall trading volume sits well below $15m.

During the weekend, the momentum can easily swing either way for altcoins, tokens, or assets. As far as the Cardano price is concerned, there is still a lot of initial promise. Its most recent gains are also interesting to take note of at this time. Traders who have kept a close eye on the altcoin markets in recent weeks may have noted some interesting trends are taking shape. While Cardano is not known for its major pump cycles or steep gains out of the blue, the market seems to be moving up slowly and surely. Even today, this is one of the few top 10 markets in the green, which further confirms the demand for ADA is not drying up just yet. To put this in perspective, the Cardano price has gained another 4.3% in both USD and BTC alike. This brings the value to $0.061958 or 1,543 Satoshi. A lot of traders and speculators will be quite happy with this trend, although it is merely a continuation of what has been taking place nearly all week long. Combined with $127.22m in trading volume, it is evident there may be some further gains on the horizon for ADA. However, that will only happen if Bitcoin doesn\u2019t lose more value than it already has. One particular and peculiar trend in the Cardano ecosystem is how Charles Hoskinson likes to do many surprise AMAs through social media and YouTube. This most recent addition seemingly got a lot of valuable feedback once again, although some users have indicated they would like to see fewer videos and more actual work being done. As the Shelly release is just around the corner, it seems this surprise AMA came at the right time. It would also appear a lot of traders are at a point where taking profit becomes rather straightforward. Wallstreet Income confirms they noted 219.2% profit with Cardano so far. Although pump signal groups should never be trusted or paid for by any means, it is a clear indication Cardano checks a lot of right boxes for traders and speculators alike. How high this price can go from this point onward, is very difficult to predict. It would also appear some people are getting better at predicting the Cardano value movements. While one always should conduct their own research and not blindly follow any price chart, it would appear one of these charts is bang on the money, for a change. He accurately predicted most market movements to a T, although there were some minor hiccups as well. That particular chart seems to indicate there is room for further gains, albeit not too many. For the time being, there is nothing to overly concerned about when it comes to the current Cardano value. While there is room for some further gains, it seems there could be a fair bit of bearish pressure looming ahead as well. As long as ADA remains above $0.061, most traders and holders will be quite pleased with how things are going as of right now. Even so, a massive Bitcoin collapse- which plenty of traders still expect \u2013 could easily send this market in a downward spiral as well. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

That is completely normal behavior when Bitcoin turns ever so slightly bearish once again. It puts a lot of strain on other top markets, although the Litecoin price is still doing its own thing. Sustaining this current upward momentum will be a bit troublesome, but so far, there is no reason to panic. It is evident Bitcoin leads the dance when it comes to determining the perceived value of alternative cryptos, tokens, and assets alike. This year, however, Litecoin has shown to not be too bothered by Bitcoin\u2019s momentum when things get sour. It still benefits from a bullish BTC run like every other market, but the altcoin can stand on its own two legs without major issues. Today is another interesting example in this regard. To put this in perspective, the Litecoin price has gained 1.8% in USD value and 2.14% in BTC value. It is especially this latter aspect which triggers some cautious optimism. Sustaining gains over Bitcoin is crucial to ensure the USD value doesn\u2019t plummet right away. For now, one LTC remains at a value of $60.87, although it seems further gains may be difficult to achieve. It would appear the traders and speculator son social media do not favor Litecoin\u2019s chances at this point. Bully the Bear, for example, expects \u201cheavy dumps\u201d to materialize in the hours to come. So far, the market has not shown any real signs of weakness, although one never knows if that might be a mirage. Calling for heavy dumps seems a bit odd at this point, however. A similar sentiment is echoed by Frenchy\u2019s Crypto Charts. This user sees a problematic near-term future for the LTC/BTC chart, although it remains to be seen if these predictions carry any real weight. A drop to 0.0135 BTC would not be that problematic for Litecoin by any means. It would represent a near 10% decline, though, which seems rather steep given the current trading volume and overall momentum. For those traders who want to get the most bang for their buck, an interesting triangular arbitrage opportunity involving Litecoin has appeared. With a potential profit of just over 49%, there is a lot of good money to be mad. That is assuming there will be sufficient liquidity across all of the involved exchanges. Kraken and Binance should pose no problems, but Livecoin is usually a very different story. All of these signs seem to indicate Litecoin is successful in bucking the bearish trend at this time. Even though traders and speculators expect this uptrend to collapse fairly soon, there is seemingly no indication those predictions will come true. As the day progresses, however, there can always be unexpected changes which cause a ripple effect. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Today seems to offer something most people had expected, although some markets have effectively begun moving up as well. With the Basic Attention Token price noting some solid gains in quick succession, it would appear as if traders might make some good money in the process. Not a week goes by without any recently listed currency on Coinbase noting value when the markets turn bearish. A few months ago, those currencies were somewhat random. This day and age, it appears Basic Attention Token is the go-to staple in terms of noting small gains when Bitcoin is facing some problems. As that particular bearish Bitcoin trend continues, it seems as if other markets need to start moving up on their own. BAT Is doing a good job in that regard, although there is still a long way to go. To be more specific, the Basic Attention Token price has risen by 5% in USD value and 5.8% over Bitcoin and Ethereum. Both of these trends are pretty interesting to keep an eye on, although it remains to be seen how this will play out for this market over the next few hours. With a current value of $0.21, or 5,255 Satoshi, BAT looks rather good. However, sustaining an uptrend throughout the weekend is always difficult, if not nigh impossible. It is evident a lot of people have high hopes for this particular market at this time, although there is still a long way to go. CryptoPolls expects both ADA and BAT to remain bullish for some time to come, although nothing is ever set in stone in this particular industry. The main question is whether Bitcoin will go down in value, as that can easily drag all alternative markets down with it. When looking at the actual BAT price, it would appear the current chart looks somewhat interesting. Following some strong gains in recent hours, one has to wonder if this momentum is even remotely sustainable at this time. Especially the BAT/JPY market is going through a massive uptrend right now, yet it seems that may be the first market to meet a lot of bearish pressure in the process. For those traders and speculators who want to make some money but not hold on to their Basic Attention Token for too long, a triangular arbitrage option has arisen. It is possible to make some good money by buying and flipping BAT between VeBitcoin and Binance, which can yield a pretty decent profit of up to 1.7%. Although this may not necessarily be the most profitable option to deal with BAT at this time, one has to keep in mind decent and easy profits should never be overlooked either. It is only normal to see a few people get excited about the current Basic Attention Token value increase. While there is still a very long way to go prior to solidifying these gains, it seems today may offer some rather interesting price momentum regardless. While no major gains should be expected from any major market at this time, there is a good chance some other markets may start to move up as well. As such, the coming hours may prove rather interesting to keep an eye on. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

The NEM price, while often overlooked by a lot of people, is seemingly noting some strong gains as of late. Although the momentum is not exceptional or spectacular by any means, a lot of holders and traders will be pleased with the current progress. If it can be sustained, today may be a positive time for this particular altcoin. It is evident all of the markets in the top 25 often rely on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum first and foremost. As the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency faces yet another minor wave of bearish pressure, there is nothing to get overly excited about. However, not all markets within the top 25 are following Bitcoin\u2019s trend, which is pretty interesting to keep an eye on. When even NEM notes some decent gains, one knows things will get pretty interesting in many different ways. Over the past 24 hours, the NEM price successfully gained 1.96% in USD value and 2.21% on Bitcoin. Both of these trends push the current value to $0.051448, or 1,282 Satoshi. A very promising development, especially considering how the overall trading volume is pretty weak. Considering how $14m in volume will not get any market traders excited, it seems to be sufficient to keep this trend going for a while. At the same time, a bearish trend can materialize at any given time. The big news of this week for NEM is how there is some public feedback opportunity involving the project\u2019s Catapult system. As this new feature will be an integral part of the NEM ecosystem moving forward, collecting feedback from the public is always a good way to see where things stand. There also appears to be an indication the consensus mechanism will be changed to Proof-of-Stake+, which sounds pretty interesting, all things considered. It would also appear NEM is gaining a lot of traction in Ukraine as of late. When it comes to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, Ukraine has proven to be a very interesting and prominent region in recent years. It is a bit unclear why NEM is gaining traction over there all of a sudden, but the development is pretty interesting, all things considered. For those who are merely interested in the NEM value chart itself, it seems the current uptrend is not necessarily set in stone by any means. More specifically, it appears there is still a lot of resistance looming ahead, which may prove rather difficult to break through. Assuming NEM doesn\u2019t break through those levels, it seems unlikely major gains will materialize in the future. Based on the current market circumstances, one would expect the NEM trend to continue for quite some time to come. However, the weak trading volume, combined with the resistance levels waiting to be broken through paint a rather bleak picture for NEM today. While there is always a chance the momentum will take a completely different direction, the current trend lacks any real conviction by the look of things.

Most of the markets are seemingly moving up once again, although there is still a lot of work to be done. As far as the Huobi Token price is concerned, it appears the value is rising primarily because of the first token listing on Huobi Prime will occur fairly soon. The year 2019 has been primarily about exchange-oriented tokens rising in value, by the look of things. As Binance Coin continues to fire on all cylinders, Huobi Token has also begun making a name for itself. It appears to be a matter of time until KuCoin Shares will go down a similar path, assuming that exchange decides to venture into \u201cselect token listings\u201d as well. Huobi is only the second major exchange to do so recently, and it seems that decision is already paying off for HT holders. Over the past few hours of the early Monday morning, it appears the Huobi Token price has risen by 7.3% in USD and ETH value. There is also a 6.9% gain in BTC value, which will please a lot of users in the process. With a current value of $2.55, or 63,376 Satoshi, it seems everything is progressing as expected. The overall trading volume of $82m is also pretty interesting to keep an eye on, as it could be sufficient to keep things going. The main reason for this HT value increase is the impending launch of the first token listing on Huobi Prime. As users will not need to meet the 500 HT requirement to participate, there will undoubtedly be high price expectations for HT. Depending on how successful this token sale proves to be, Huobi Token may effectively follow a path similar to Binance Coin. For now, a lot of questions are still waiting to be answered. There is also a chance the current HT price trend is materializing because of the recent Pundi X listing. While there may be no obvious correlation between the two, there will undoubtedly be an NPXS/HT trading pair sooner or later. It seems a lot of things are coming together for Huobi Global in very quick succession, which usually tends to get a lot of traders excited in the process. For now, there is still some market uncertainty, For those who take a closer look at the HT price chart, it quickly becomes evident things can get pretty interesting over the next few hours and days. There is a good chance this market trend will collapse once again in pretty quick succession, although one never knows how all of these markets will evolve. Most of it will also depend on what happens to Bitcoin, which is always a mystery As Bullish as Huobi Token may seem right now, nothing is ever set in stone. Cryptocurrencies, assets, and tokens often evolve in many different ways, which can make for interesting momentum down the road. While the trading volume for HT looks pretty significant right now, there is always a chance it can come back to haunt the market as well. Sustaining the $2.5 level will be the main order of business for this token. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

The EOS price, while looking somewhat promising on the hourly chart, has yet to overcome a few hurdles along the way. For the time being, this market falls victim to the same bearish pressure as all other top cryptocurrencies. Not the trend traders had hoped for, but the ship can be turned around with too many problems. It is evident the current cryptocurrency market trend is not too promising for most of the top markets. That is not entirely abnormal, as nearly everything in the top 15 will follow Bitcoin\u2019s lead when it comes to price changes. EOS is a dutiful follower in this regard, even though holders and traders had expected something entirely different. Bucking the pressure will not be easy by any means, but it is not impossible either. Over the past 24 hours, the EOS price has reduced by 1.54% in USD value, bringing the price down to $3.67. There is also a smaller EOS/BTC downtrend with a 0.62% loss. Because of this second development, the current value sits at 90,736 Satoshi. Neither of these trends is exactly beneficial to EOS, but it seems the EOS/BTC losses can be offset without too many problems. The current trading volume is also interesting, as it sits at $1.663bn. There are quite a few interesting EOS-related developments on the horizon, by the look of things. First of all, the EOSFinex platform has gotten closer to being released. It is expected a beta will become accessible in the next few weeks to come, That in itself will bring some positive attention to the platform itself, as well as the EOS currency in its own right Whether or not it can impact the EOS value in any way, is a different manner. There is also some community excitement regarding the EOS World Expo. It is a good example of how this ecosystem continues to grow. According to the official Twitter account, there is a growing list of apps and attendees to keep an eye on. Additionally, there may be multiple announcements in the coming weeks, although no further details have been provided in this regard. An interesting future lies ahead either way, although no price impact is expected at this time either. The recently issued \u201crankings\u201d of blockchain ecosystems released by the CCID continues to spark many different discussions. There are plenty of people who consider EOS and Tron to be on the same level, even though the CCID has a very different opinion. EOS is favored for its creativity and basic tech, whereas Tron seemingly has better applicability. Rest assured these rankings will continue to shift around quite regularly in the months to come. When looking at the bigger picture, it quickly becomes apparent things are looking neither bad nor good for EOS at this time. If the EOS/BTC can be overcome without too many problems, there is a good chance the situation will improve sooner rather than later. A push to $3.75 would certainly become plausible at that time, although no one can accurately predict how things will evolve in the coming hours, especially with the weekend right around the corner.

As most of the bearish pressure has relented once again, the markets are trying to move up in a swift manner. The Binance Coin price is noting some modest gains, although some traders expect this latest run to carry a lot of weight. Only time will tell if they are correct in that assumption. It is evident the cryptocurrency markets have waited for Bitcoin to move up throughout the first half of the day. Albeit it took some time to do so, the current momentum seems to indicate this weekend may not be all that negative. As Binance Coin starts moving up again rather quickly, there will be plenty of people trying to chase the top. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a 3.87% Binance Coin price increase. In USD terms, the token is now valued at $15.27. There are also gains in ETH and BTC value, pushing the ratio to 0.00378 BTC or 0.11 Ether. All of these trends are incredibly promising for a lot of traders, albeit there is always a chance the current uptrend will be negated fairly quickly One aspect driving the Binance Coin trend first and foremost is the social activity surrounding this project. Chuck Costellos goes as far as claiming how Binance Coin is the new Bitcoin and XRP is dead. Both of these statements are factually incorrect, albeit it is evident he has high expectations for BNB. It is now up to this project to deliver on those expectations, which is never an easy task. Whenever Weiss Ratings shares something on Twitter, it is evident a lot of people will listen. The company touches upon Binance\u2019s alleged hide-and-seek game in terms of regulation and moving the headquarters around the globe. How that would affect Binance Coin\u2019s credibility, remains unclear. It also didn\u2019t take long for BNB supporters to come to the project\u2019s rescue in this regard. Most cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets are complicated to obtain for the average consumer. Binance Coin is now seemingly being integrated into various Bitcoin ATMs. For now, this appears to be a one-way transaction provided by the CoinFlip team, although they are looking at ways to enable two-way support. An interesting development worth keeping an eye on. Making it easier to access these tokens, assets, and currencies is always beneficial to the overall ecosystem. While some people are openly taking exception to Binance Coin these days, no one will deny the value continues to move up over time. A push to $16 is rather unlikely to materialize this weekend, although it will primarily depend on whether Bitcoin turns bullish or not. For now, BNB is in a good place, yet it seems likely there will be some price resistance on the horizon fairly soon. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Most people would expect the Electroneum price to go on the rise at this point, yet it seems the market isn\u2019t moving all that much. In fact, there is still a net loss in both USD and BTC value to contend with, which might not necessarily go away anytime soon. When it comes to the different cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets on the market, most of them tend to follow Bitcoin\u2019s price trend blindly. While that is not necessarily the case for all projects, it has been an interesting correlation to keep an eye on. As Bitcoin has now tried to turn bullish again, the alternative markets would usually follow quite without giving it a second thought. Electroneum is one notable exception in this regard, for some unknown reason. More specifically, the Electroneum price has lost 2.4% in both USD and BTC value in the past 24 hours. It is not the biggest deficit by any means, yet it will certainly worry a fair few holders and speculators. Because of these declines, one ETN is now priced at $0.006288, or 156 Satoshi. Thankfully, it seems the trading volume is still picking up, as it sits at just under $9.4m sat this time. It would appear a fair few enthusiasts are quite pleased with the Electroneum M1 smartphone release. Simo18121 has seemingly gotten his hands on one of these devices, as they are now available from Amazon UK. It is still a pretty interesting development to see such a device being produced and offered on a major platform. Whether or not it will lead to mass adoption, is a different matter altogether. Secondly, it seems some users are trying to convince Kim Dotcom to look into Electroneum. While such an effort can be worthwhile, it seems unlikely this individual will pay special attention to ETN. While the project is trucking along nicely, Dotcom has always been a fan of Bitcoin first and foremost. As such, his advice to reinvest in gold, silver, and \u201ccrypto\u201d will probably not encompass any altcoins or alternative markets. When it comes to the Electroneum trading volume, there are some concerns as to how the individual exchanges are shaping up right now. More specifically, Steve Elliot is pleased to see KuCoin and Huobi note strong ETN volume, whereas the COinbene volume seems to be plummeting pretty quickly. It is a bit odd to see this platform be relegated to $14 on the exchange rankings all of a sudden, although others are taking its place without too many problems. The big question leading into this weekend is whether or not Electroneum can turn this price momentum around without any real problems. The trading volume should not necessarily pose any problems in that regard, although it remains to be seen if the price will be able to respond in kind. There is no real reason for ETN to remain in the red for very long, although cryptocurrency markets usually respond in odd ways during the weekend.

Contrary to most people\u2019s expectations, the Tron price is moving up fairly quickly. After surpassing the 600 Satoshi level once again, it would appear TRX is in a pretty good place. That is, assuming that uptrend can be sustained for more than a few hours. Most traders will be quite pleased to learn the bearish pressure has not remained in place for very long. While yesterday did not look too great, today seems to offer a bit more hope. Bitcoin is already on the retrace again, though, and this may hurt all alternative markets moving forward. For the time being, Tron seems to buck the negative trend. Its gains are still in place, although one has to keep in mind there will be plenty of resistance to keep an eye on. Over the past 24 hours, the Tron price noted a strong 6.86% increase in USD value. This brings the value to $0.02432 again, although a push to $0.025 is not necessarily feasible at this point. In terms of TRX/BTC, there is a 7.41% gain, bringing that ratio back to 605 Satoshi. Maintaining a hold of the 600 Satoshi level will not be easy whatsoever, but it can be done. The current trading volume should make that possible, although one never knows how things will play out. Although the current TRX price momentum seems to be doing quite well, there are still lots of people who oppose the concept of Tron and its founder Justin Sun. Geoff Golberg, for example, would like to point out roughly 20,000 of Sun\u2019s recent Twitter followers were created in the month of March 2019. They also seem to simply want to partake in his $20,000 giveaway, which will always attract some sort of unwanted attention. How this affects the perception of Tron, is a bit unclear at this time. Crypto Picks, an avid watcher of crypto price charts is not too convinced there will be a long-term Tron uptrend to keep an eye on. More specifically, he expects the TRX/BTC ratio to remain as bearish as it has been for some time now. The current push to above 600 Satoshi may come under a lot of pressure in this regard, although it is still early to draw any real conclusions. There is always a chance this \u201cdoom scenario\u201d will play out as foretold. When looking at the more detailed charts, it seems there is a good reason as to why people expect a downtrend fairly soon. With such a bullish candle materializing out of the blue, there is a good chance this uptrend cannot be sustained for very long. After all, a bullish candle sparks excitement, but they are also very difficult to sustain for an extended period of time. While Tron might be an exception, it is more likely to expect things to return to normal fairly soon. For the time being, most of the crypto, token, and asset markets are under a fair bit of pressure. Despite some positive trends forming across the board, it is evident a Bitcoin price retrace will drag all other markets down with it in the process. How this will affect Tron, is always difficult to predict. While this market is usually rather resilient, it is impossible to buck the overall trend if it remains in place. As such, this weekend will prove to be interesting for many different reasons. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Up until an hour ago, it seemed as if most markets would turn bullish. Right now, some of that momentum has been eroded once again. None of the top markets look incredibly good right now, as even the XRP price suffers from uncertainty. It is evident the current top crypto market momentum doesn\u2019t offer much excitement. With all of the top projects either at a status quo or noting minor gains, the expected bull run fails to materialize so far. Even XRP isn\u2019t showing any signs of either positive or negative pressure, which makes traders rather twitchy. As the weekend looms ahead, the coming 72 hours may prove rather crucial for this market. To put the current momentum in its proper perspective, the XRP price gained 0.2% in USD value and 0.1% in BTC value. As such, one XRP is valued at $0.313, or 7,775 Satoshi. This latter ratio struggles to improve, by the look of things, as a return to 8,000 Satoshi or more will seemingly not happen anytime soon. Some traders are getting fed up with the way some XRP community members respond to everything which might put this project in a negative spotlight. Even a bearish technical analysis is not welcome by any means, even if it seemed to be somewhat accurate at that time. A bit of a troublesome development, although it is nothing to lose sleep over either. In more positive news, it would appear some users still expect major growth for Ripple and XRP in the first half of 2019. Although the date proposed by ELITES is probably an April Fool\u2019s joke reference, one never knows what RIpple might have in store. For now, nothing has been officially announced for April 1st, albeit only time will tell if it is a date to take note of. There is also some potential concern over Western Union\u2019s relationship with Ripple. As the company is seemingly interested in Stellar \u2013 via Thunes \u2013 it remains to be seen what will come of these developments. It is always good to trial competing solutions, although it appears the \u201cdeal\u201d with Ripple was pretty much in the bag. For now, it has zero impact on the XRP value, although that situation could always change. All signs seem to indicate the overall status quo will remain in place for the remainder of the day. Unless Bitcoin were to turn mega bearish or bullish over the weekend, XRP\u2019s value will not necessarily undergo any real changes.

While that might not please too many users, it is evident this pressure will not relent automatically either. Despite this overwhelming pressure, it appears the DigiByte price is still moving up rather swiftly. A bit of a surprising development, as this market is often overlooked by most traders and speculators. Not all cryptocurrencies follow Bitcoin\u2019s price trend blindly. That in itself is quite promising in this day and age, although one has to wonder if this situation can remain in place for very long. As of right now, it seems DigiByte is capable of successfully avoiding Bitcoin\u2019s trend, although it is doing so in a way that might not make too much sense to a lot of enthusiasts. Especially its very weak trading volume is a big question mark. Over the past few hours, the DigiByte price managed to gain 9.42% in USD value and 11.13% over Bitcoin itself. Both trends are very impressive, especially for an altcoin which barely notes $2.881m in trading volume. Because of this somewhat surprising uptrend, the current value per DGB sits at $0.014539, or 362 Satoshi. As both of these trends prove to be somewhat promising, one also has to wonder how long they will remain in place. Bucking the overall industry-wide trend for very long is usually rather difficult. When it comes to surprising developments like these it is pertinent to keep an eye on social media. Although the opinions on DigiByte are a bit all over the place, some users would like to see DGB make its way to Coinbase in the very near future. While it is not impossible by any means, it will be interesting to see if the company effectively takes customer feedback to heart in this day and age. CryptoDucky, on the other hand, isn\u2019t too bothered with having this altcoin listed on more exchanges such as Coinbase. Instead, he predicts DGB is one of the two currencies one needs to hold to become rich in the near future. While that level of optimism certainly is something else, it seems unlikely either of those two markets will pop off when Bitcoin remains as bearish as it is right now. For traders willing to take a bit of a gamble with DigiByte, there is an interesting triangular arbitrage opportunity worth looking into. It can yield a potential profit of over 11%, although it does require the use of some lesser-known exchanges and trading platforms. As such, this option might not be as appealing to everyone, but it is still an option worth looking into regardless. Although DigiByte is one of the more bullish markets within the market cap top 40 right now, it remains doubtful these gains can remain in place for very long. Bucking Bitcoin\u2019s trend is usually very complicated for most altcoins, and it seems unlikely DigiByte will form an exception in this regard. However, if its trading volume were to pick up all of a sudden, there may be some interesting momentum to keep an eye on. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

With Bitcoin and other top markets in the dirt a bit, it is all the more interesting to see the Ethereum Classic price move up all of a sudden. Although the gains are not spectacular, there is always a chance this altcoin will hit $5 in the next few hours and days. When the top markets turn rather bearish, one has to be happy with any market which does not blindly follow this pattern. Although Ethereum Classic is not the most popular project by any means, it is evident the current price momentum will get many people excited a bit. It is also the only market in the market cap top 20 which notes gains of over 4% right now, thus it seems likely a lot of people will try to make good money with it in the process. Over the past 24 hours, the Ethereum Classic price noted a strong 4.75% gain to push the USD value to $4.83. There is also a 5.8% improvement in ETC/BTC, bringing that ratio to 0.0012 Bitcoin. Both of these trends are made possible thanks to over $338.8m in trading volume, which is rather steep for this particular market. As is usually the case when Ethereum Classic\u2019s value begins to rise, there will be some funny memes to enjoy. Stev shares a pretty interesting one, and one that is also factually correct. Ethereum Classic is capable of noting gains whereas other markets are at a near standstill. Sustaining this level of growth will always be complicated, especially with the overarching bearish pressure affecting this industry. For those who mainly want to determine where the price will head next, it seems the ETC chart looks somewhat promising. Nevermore expects some intriguing price action on Coinbase in the ETC/USD pair, although it seems unlikely any major push should be expected. Reaching $5 is still possible right now, although it will require some significant effort to make that happen. A somewhat similar sentiment is echoed by Crypto Fibonacci, who is looking at the ETC chart like a hawk. It is obvious ETC is not only bucking Bitcoin\u2019s trend, but it does the exact opposite. Not necessarily all that significant for a market which tends to pump at random over the past year and a half, but still interesting for traders. All things considered, it would appear Ethereum Classic could maintain this \u201cbullish\u201d momentum for the remainder of the day. It is not that difficult to buck the current bearish trend, and the rather high trading volume seems to indicate traders will not relent anytime soon. However, this market tends to flip from bullish to bearish and vice versa on a seemingly random basis. Chasing the pump is never a smart idea. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Today is no exception in this regard, as the entire top 10 \u2013 except Tether \u2013 has lost over 1% in value. Further down the ranking, the IOTA price is putting up a valiant fight. It genuinely attempts to buck the trend and stay above $0.30. So far, so good, for this market. It is not all that easy for any cryptocurrency to note solid gains when Bitcoin goes in the red. Although it remains to be seen how long IOTA can avoid this bearish pressure, the current momentum doesn\u2019t look half bad by any means. There is some effort by trades to keep this train going and ensure one MIOTA doesn\u2019t drop below $0.3. Whereas Bitcoin has lost over 1.3% in value today, the IOTA price has gained 2.8% in USD value and 4% over Bitcoin. As such, one MIOTA is currently priced at $0.307143, or 7,648 Satoshi. A more than respectable value for a market which struggles to generate even $25m in actual trading volume. One would expect this figure to be higher following this promising trend. Unlike other altcoins which pump for no reason, there is an IOTA-related development which gets some people excited. Zeux has confirmed they are adding IOTA as a solution for crypto payments. Developments like these can help put this project on the map, as it can be used for payments at retail stores. While Zeus may not influence the MIOTA price all that much, it is a promising sign for the community members. Heico Ebach thinks IOTA is one of the, if not the most undervalued market in all of cryptocurrency right now. Its current market cap seems fairly solid, although some users would like to see it double or more in quick succession. As long as Bitcoin remains this finicky and bearish, that will not happen in the near future. Without a bullish Bitcoin trend, IOTA\u2019s market cap will not explode on its own. When looking at the actual price chart, a very interesting pattern becomes visible right away. There is a head and shoulder pattern on the IOTA chart, at least for those who want to see it that way. With a breakout right after completing the \u201cright shoulder\u2019, it is expected a bull trend will emerge. So far, it is too early to use the term \u201cbullish\u201d, especially because of a weak hourly candle. The current IOTA outlook is not as bearish as one would expect when looking at the overall trend. However, just because MIOTA is still in the green right now does not mean it will stay that way for much longer. With the lack of real trading volume, triggering a very bearish candle would not be entirely all that difficult. The coming hours will be crucial for this market either for better or worse.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/the-tor-project-enables-cryptocurrency-donation-support/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "The Tor Project Enables Cryptocurrency Donation Support", "content": "Regardless of how one wants to look at things, it has become apparent Tor plays a growing role of importance in the cryptocurrency world. A lot of privacy-oriented projects tend to rely on Tor in terms of maintaining privacy and anonymity. In a somewhat surprising turn of events, the Tor project now accepts various cryptocurrencies for donations. This is a pretty intriguing development, although it remains to be seen if it will yield any major donations. Over the past few years, numerous companies have begun introducing cryptocurrency donation support. While this is a good way to bring Bitcoin and select altcoins into the mainstream, it also appears most of these efforts are rather short-lived in terms of gaining attention. With the current bear market still in effect, a lot of crypto holders are less eager to spend their holdings as well. How that will affect the Tor Project\u2019s recent decision, remains to be determined. To be more specific, the Tor Project has officially begun accepting a handful of cryptocurrencies for donations. That list includes Bitcoin, Litecoin, Stellar Lumens, Dash, Ethereum, Augur, Bitcoin Cash, Monero, and ZCash. What makes that list so particularly interesting is how it lists numerous non-privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies. The use for Augur is also a bit unusual, as it is a token on the Ethereum blockchain. With hundreds of tokens on that network, choosing this one over the rest will undoubtedly raise a lot of questions. Additionally, it would appear the donation form for the various cryptocurrencies give users an option to include their personal information. Although anonymous donations are possible as well, one has to wonder why anyone would effectively share their name and address in the first place. Tor doesn\u2019t have a terrible reputation by any means, but cryptocurrency users have never been keen on sharing their personal information in any way, shape, or form. On social media, there is also some initial backlash to this recent decision. While some users offer helpful comments in terms of making this donation process a bit more automated, there are also a lot of people who see this as a \u201chalf-assed\u201d attempt at trying to get on the crypto hype bandwagon. With only an option to manually copy donation addresses, sending transactions from a mobile device is pretty much impossible. Additionally, it is not the most secure method of dealing with crypto payments in general. As one would come to expect, there are also a lot of people who don\u2019t necessarily agree with this list of supported currencies. Since so many coins sue Tor for any concept or another, it is only normal those currencies want to gain \u201csupport\u201d through this donation page as well. Discussions like those can be quite interesting to keep an eye on in the future, although it is logical to assume a lot of these smaller projects will be overlooked for the foreseeable future. There are also a handful of people who simply oppose this idea altogether. Since Tor is a project which has some ties to the US government, the recent net neutrality discussions have made it fall out of a favor a bit. Moreover, there are some users who prefer donating to open source contribution, rather than this particular project. It is evident this crypto donation-related decision has already sparked a few interesting discussions which are all worth keeping an eye on.", "date": "2019-03-22T09:16:52+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 22}

As of right now, everything in the top 10 looks rather bleak, primarily because Bitcoin is bleeding value all over the place. However, there is always a chance some positive momentum occurs because of this trend. When even the Dogecoin price is in the red, however, the future is not looking too great. In the world of cryptocurrency, there is a lot of information to keep an eye on. Not all markets will follow the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency\u2019s price trend, which is always a welcome sight. When it comes to Dogecoin, however, it would appear there is always some adverse momentum. It is worth keeping an eye on Dogecoin at all times, as it is usually an indicator as to what will happen to the other markets over the next few hours. Right now, that trend is not necessarily too promising. Over the past 24 hours, Dogecoin has been somewhat successful in terms of maintaining its current value. Although a 0.12% drop isn\u2019t too bothersome whatsoever, one has to keep in mind that in itself does not look promising whatsoever. There is a 1.12% gain in DOGE/BTC at this time, however, which could easily offset the minor USD losses over the coming hours. That is, assuming this DOGE/BTC trend will remain in place, which may prove to be rather difficult to maintain. On social media, it would appear something interesting is happening. Although the Dogecoin community still wants to get DOGE listed on Coinbase in the near future, it seems these demands are growing less common. This may be a sign of the community giving up on this project as a whole, although it is also possible Dogecoin doesn\u2019t even need Coinbase in the first place. The recently listed coins on this exchange have not done too great in the price department, after all. In the world of Dogecoin, there is never a lack of memes and funny images. Dogecoin Memes has shared a nice meme this time around and one that shows how one\u2019s Dogecoin memes folder will usually trump that of Windows or the regular memes one. Images like these will keep the community entertained for some time to come, although it is evident it will not impact the price whatsoever. A good meme a day keeps the depression away, though. The day can only get better when there is not just one, but two separate Dogecoin memes in one day. Siyana would like to see Dogecoin pump, rather than dump. While that is to be expected from traders and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, it seems unlikely there will be any major price increase in the near future. However, with the strong DOGE/BTC gains in place, there is a chance there won\u2019t be much of a dump either throughout the rest of the day. As is usually the case when it comes to Dogecoin, this market is even more predictable than most others out there. Since it doesn\u2019t appear to rely on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum all that much, there is a good chance things will turn out to be rather interesting moving forward. How high or low the value will go throughout the day and over the weekend, is very difficult to predict. After all, there is usually a lot of surprising price momentum during the weekend.

In this volatile industry, one of those coins can be found virtually every other day. Despite noting very strong gains a few days ago, it would appear the ABBC Coin price is dropping hard right now. Completely to be expected at this time, as the bearish pressure isn\u2019t relenting. Most people will readily agree the recent ABBC Coin pump took them by surprise. Not because of the intensity of the pump itself, but rather because the project itself seemingly doesn\u2019t amount to all that much either. While it does try to use the Alibaba name, it seems to be very unsuccessful in this regard. As such, it is only normal the price comes down again after this recent surge. Slowly but surely, it appears to be returning to its pre-pump levels. To put this in perspective, the ABBC Coin price hit $0.622 a few days ago. Ever since that time, it has retraced rather violently, which is only normal. Because of today\u2019s 11.6% loss in USD value and 10.83% decrease in Bitcoin value, the current value dropped to $0.227653. It seems likely this value will continue to decrease and even hit $0.2 before the day is over. While there is still a lot of trading volume, it seems most traders are cashing out to keep losses to a minimum. Because of this recent 36% decrease in value over the past 7 days, it remains to be seen what the future will hold for ABBC Coin moving forward. Its top markets are still TOPBTC, BitForex, and RightBTC< neither of which are all that popular among most cryptocurrency traders. Moreover, without clear use cases for this altcoin, it seems unlikely there will be a rebound in the near future. One never knows with these small altcoins, though, For traders who bought the top, it seems unlikely they will recover their investment anytime soon, if ever. That is the danger when it comes to chasing pumps, as they will usually be over by the time most people take notice of them. ABBC Coin is a clear example, as all of the hype surrounding this project has evaporated when the market turned bearish. As that trend continues, it is evident traders who want to make money shouldn\u2019t be looking to buy in right now. At the same time, there was some initial excitement regarding ABBC Coin just yesterday. After a brief and unexpected 5.62% gain materialized out of the blue, some users thought history would repeat itself. In reality, things often work out very differently. That positive momentum was very short lived and how added to the pressure for ABBC Coin. For now, it seems likely to assume the weekend will bring more of the same. With the weekend just around the corner, there is usually a sense of unease among cryptocurrency users. Since weekends usually yield bearish pressure, and the current trend is bearish already, the losses will either continue to pile up or some unexpected bullish momentum will materialize. For ABBC Coin, no real gains should be expected except for an out-of-the-blue bullish candle. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Top markets are still down, and most alternative markets are either at break even or note slight gains. Traders currently searching for bullish momentum will not have an easy task doing so. Surprisingly enough, the Ontology price is moving up once again, as it seeks entry into the market cap top 15. When it comes to looking at the overall cryptocurrency industry, there are always a fair few unknown aspects to keep in mind. Even when an altcoin is rising in value all of a sudden, one has to keep in mind there is a chance the momentum will reverse course fairly soon. In the case of Ontology, there is plenty of positive momentum right now, even though a fair few traders have taken profit already. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a notable Ontology price increase. A fresh 15.5% gain pushes the ONT value to $1.29, or 31,783 Satoshi. Combined with $128m in overall trading volume, it seems the interest in Ontology has not subsided in the slightest. However, there doesn\u2019t appear to be any genuine reason for this latest uptrend. When traders start to see such big profits, it is only normal they start cashing out sooner rather than later. Crypto Case Info has done exactly that when the profit was a bit higher than it is right now. As such, there may be a lot of negative pressure on this market moving forward, which can pose a whole new set of problems for this altcoin. Even the Turkish traders, who have seemingly taken a major interest in all pumpy altcoins these days, are looking at this market with some doubt. It now seems the rising triangle has pretty much peaked and will see some pushback toward the 30,000 Satoshi level fairly soon. However, that will primarily depend on what happens to Bitcoin in the next few hours and days. Coco Manji, on the other hand, is keeping somewhat of a long-term view on Ontology. By doing so, this user pocketed a potential profit of up to 25%, which is more than acceptable under the current market circumstances. Although that uptrend will not be sustained for very long, it is sometimes worthwhile to keep holding when the momentum turns bullish. All signs seem to indicate the Ontology value has peaked already. While that doesn\u2019t necessarily warrant a massive bearish run, it is likely some sort of correction will occur prior to the weekend. How steep that dip will be, is up to anyone\u2019s guess at this time. No one should try to chase this pump by any means, albeit traders are advised to make their own decisions at all times.

Although some currencies are trying to turn the negative into a positive, the road ahead will be filled with roadblocks and hurdles. As long as the Dogecoin price remains in the red, there is a good chance no real price breakout will occur for Bitcoin or Ethereum. Although there isn\u2019t anything to warrant the current bearish pressure across the top markets, there is also no reason to expect a sudden price reversal either. Bitcoin is trying to climb out of the small hole it dug itself in, although there is still plenty of work to be done. This affects all other markets as well, with Dogecoin struggling a fair bit on its own. A drop below $0.002 seems unlikely, but the DOGE/BTC ratio turns rather bearish once again. To put this in perspective, there has been a 1.4% decrease as far as the Dogecoin price is concerned. This discrepancy is notable in both USD value, as one OGE is priced at $0.002062, or 51 Satoshi. While the 50 Satoshi will continue to act as support, one also has to acknowledge there is only so much support to be offered. Dogecoin won\u2019t fall apart overnight, but it\u2019s not doing well either. It would appear there is an effort underway to bring more mainstream exposure to Dogecoin. The official Twitter account has reached out to Psyonix Studios to inquire about a Dogecoin decal or flag for the popular Rocket League game. It would be a promising fit, as Dogecoin has a history in terms of cars through their Nascar venture several years ago. A lot of Dogecoin traders are getting fed up with Binance. More specifically, the sheer desire by the company to not enable DOGE trading, for some unknown reason. Millennial Hoarder claims Binance shouldn\u2019t be trusted because they don\u2019t want to list this altcoin. It is a bit unclear why DOGE still isn\u2019t on this exchange by now, but the situation is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. There is also a discussion taking place regarding the future of Dogecoin, both in terms of price and development. Jan Hvizdak, while clearly uncertain as to what will come next in either department, remains confident things will improve from here on out. Keeping the faith in a project is of the utmost importance these days, unless one wants to keep chasing quick pump-and-dump schemes for profit. All things considered, it would appear this negative Dogecoin momentum could remain in place throughout the remainder of the day. While that is not necessarily promising by any means, there is nothing to be overly concerned about either. The trading volume looks a bit bleak, all things considered, thus the coming hours may prove to be rather crucial in many different ways. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

The VeChain price is trying to move up in a decisive manner, although overcoming the key resistance levels will pose a big challenge. For now, the push to $0.006 is still in full effect. Once the trading volume picks up a bit, that value may not seem that far away. It is always interesting to see most of the top 25 markets move up when Bitcoin gets rid of most of the bearish pressure. While the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency itself isn\u2019t moving up all that much, the rest of the markets are benefiting from it regardless. VeChain is an interesting example in that regard, although the main question is how high the value can go over the next few hours and days. To recap the past 24 hours, there has been a notable 5.8% increase in the VeChain price. This brings the USD value to $0.005744, which is not all that bad at this time. There is also a 5% uptrend in VET/BTC, driving that ratio to 141 Satoshi. It seems unlikely the 150 Satoshi level will be reached anytime soon, especially with just $20.3m in overall trading volume. On social media, there is some interesting sentiment toward VeChain at this time. Jason Rockwood is one of those people who is more keen on checking what applications will be built on top of this ecosystem, rather than just looking at price charts. It is evident the community has high hopes for applications and platforms to be built on top of VeChainThor, although it remains to be seen how things will play out. Crypto Robin, on the other hand, is extremely excited about the upcoming VeChain Summit of 2019. As this event will occur in April of 2019, there are plenty of rumors circulating on the internet regarding potential announcements and developers. So far, nothing has been officially confirmed in this regard. Meeting people\u2019s expectations during events like these will always be a double-edged blade. Pleasing everyone is impossible, even under the best of circumstances. As is always the case, there are plenty of people who watch the charts like a hawk to make the most money. Mind Trader is one of those individuals who expect the VET/BTC resistance to cause problems near 143 Satoshi. With the support at 136 Sats, however, no real downtrend should occur if that level can\u2019t be broken. A breakout above 143 Satoshi could trigger a pretty big next leg up, though. While it would appear the VeChain market is in a pretty good place right now, it is impossible to determine what will come next for this market. As long as Bitcoin\u2019s overall momentum remains rather indecisive, there are thousands of possible outcomes to contend with. The lack of actual trading volume could prove to be problematic first and foremost, although it hasn\u2019t held this particular market back in the past either.

Some markets note massive gains, whereas others are still on wobbly legs. Contrary to what most expected, the Holo price is not moving up a decisive manner at this stage. Although the current trend is not necessarily worrisome as of yet, finding a new foothold is not all that easy. It is commendable to see all markets carve out a path for their own these days. While most of them will continue to rely on Bitcoin first and foremost, some are doing so in a less tedious manner than others. Holo often seems to be doing its own thing regardless of the overall trend, albeit today may be a slightly different trend. Its current value sits just above $0.0012m yet it remains to be seen if that level can be maintained after all. Over the past few hours, the Holo price has noted a minor 1.85% gain to keep the USD value at $0.001207. In terms of BTC and ETH value, the gains are less spectacular, at 0.91% and 0.92% respectively. It is evident there is seemingly a lack of desire to keep this uptrend going for very long, albeit some slow and steady gains would not be all that bad for this currency either. It is a healthy change of pace from its massive gains and subsequent losses. Regardless of what might be happening behind the scenes of Holo and Holochain, most people simply care about the price. Especially the Turkish traders are smitten by this market and they expect some pretty big gains to materialize in the coming weeks and months. As is always the case where altcoin markets are concerned, anything is possible, yet nothing is ever set in stone. R.P. Is another trader who mainly wants to see the value of HOT take off in quick succession. Expecting a massive bull run before the Summer seems a bit too optimistic at this time, primarily because there is nothing which warrants an industry-wide bull run at this time. That situation may come to change in the near future, though, but it will mainly depend on Bitcoin to make big things happen. Leave it up to altcoin traders to be excited at all times and see any possible opportunity as a way to strike it rich. Frank is looking forward to what will come next for Holochain in the coming weeks and months. There is still plenty of work to be done prior to ensuring Holo becomes mainstream in any convincing way, but things are seemingly moving in the right direction. That wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact the HOT price in any way, though. For the time being, it seems the $0.0012 level will remain in play for Holo. There may be a slightly higher push in the coming hours, but it seems unlikely double-digit percentage gains should be expected at this time. The overall drop in trading volume to just $7.3m is not exactly promising either, but it doesn\u2019t have to cause any major disturbances either.

Ongoing development is vital for the success of any project, regardless of which industry it is targeting. In the case of Cardano version 1.5 has been released on the main net yesterday afternoon. It is also the final release of the Byron development phase, as the Shelley \u201cera\u201d will pave the way for a new Cardano in many different ways. As such, this most recent client and main net release are crucial to ensure the transition to Shelley can occur as swiftly as possible. As part of the update, a new consensus protocol is introduced. Such changes are always interesting to keep an eye on, as they can make or break projects quite easily. For Cardano, it seems the new consensus protocol will be known as Ouroboros BFT. It is a \u201cliaison\u201d between the current Ouroboros Classic and Ouroboros Genesis. This latter protocol will be used as part of the Shelley era moving forward, whereas its Classic counterpart will be retired. To put this development in its right perspective, the switch to Ouroboros Genesis is groundbreaking for Cardano. It will introduce the proof-of-stake concept, but with the same security-wise \u201cguarantees\u201d as proof-of-work protocols such as the one found in Bitcoin. That will be something to look forward to, albeit one has to wait and see what the future will hold exactly. The switch from Ouroboros Classic to Ouroboros BFT will occur through a separate protocol upgrade and is not part of the 1.5 release by default. As is always the case this major new release will require all network participants to upgrade as quickly as possible. Daedelus users can upgrade to Cardano 1.5 through the client version 0.13.0. Failure to upgrade in time will cause problems for the upcoming hard fork which introduces the Ouroboros BFT consensus protocol. Although it is expected there will be no major issues in this regard, it doesn\u2019t hurt to make sure users upgrade sooner rather than later. This also applies to all service providers relying on Cardano for any of its specific purposes. The main problem is how there will undoubtedly be a few different \u201cclients\u201d to facilitate this upgrade. There has been a rise in fraudulent cryptocurrency-related applications over the past few years. It is not unlikely Cardano users will be targeted by this particular aspect either. Never allow anyone to access their wallet for whatever reason, nor should users download software from unofficial sources or forum posts. Keeping tabs on this particular aspect will prove somewhat difficult, but most users should be able to rely on common sense. Cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms will also need to update the wallet API before upgrading to version 1.5. It seems that will not pose any major problems moving forward, although it will be interesting to see if all companies decide to make this happen in a swift manner. All things considered, this is a major development for the Cardano ecosystem and its community. Although the \u201cbig\u201d changes have yet to materialize, the foundation for those upgrades is in place as of right now. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Despite the potential any individual market may display at any given moment, there is not necessarily a direct correlation with the price. In the case of the Electroneum price, the current momentum doesn\u2019t seem to affect the value in a positive manner. That is a bit unusual, although there is a chance things will turn around sooner or later. In this volatile industry, it is always pertinent to keep the bigger picture in mind. While Bitcoin Maximalists might not necessarily pay much attention to the thousands of altcoins on the market, the rest of the community is looking at things from a different perspective. As far as Electroneum is concerned, there are plenty of recent developments which could effectively yield a much higher price in the near future. So far, the market hasn\u2019t responded to these developments in a promising manner, though. Over the past 24 hours, the Electroneum price has dropped by 0.34% in USD value and lost 1.5% in Bitcoin value. While the current levels of $0.006437 or 157 Satoshi are still pretty solid, it seems to be a matter of time until something changes. One would expect ETN\u2019s increased trading volume of nearly $13m to help matters move along, but that is not the case at this time. It is a sign of how the recent Huobi listing is helping this market gain more liquidity. The big news of the week is how the Electroneum M1 smartphone can now be purchased from Amazon in the United Kingdom. Although the device isn\u2019t available through Amazon in most other countries as of yet, there is a good chance it will come to the US and other major regions fairly soon. In terms of ensuring ETN gains mass adoption, this turn of events could have some very interesting consequences moving forward. There is also a chance Electroneum could be added to Litebit in the near future. While it remains to be seen if the company will acknowledge the community\u2019s interest in this regard, there is always a good chance something will happen sooner or later. Litebit has positioned itself as a relatively important gateway for cryptocurrencies in Europe as of late. They could also provide more fiat currency gateways for ETN, which can help improve the market cap ranking in the process. Last but not least, one Electroneum community member has started to print merchandise which is ETN-themed. While it remains to be seen if these products will ever become available for mass purchase, it is a very interesting initiative regardless. Spreading the word about any cryptocurrency is always an uphill battle. Clothing and other forms of merchandise may prove to be rather helpful in that regard. Although the current ETN price is still in the dirt, for the time being, there is a chance things could turn around at any given moment. With Bitcoin and other top markets showing some minor bullish signs, it is usually a matter of time until all alternative markets benefit from this particular trend as well. For Electroneum, the coming hours may prove rather crucial, although no one knows for sure how things will evolve exactly. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Today is no exception in this regard, although it would appear as if there is still some uncertainty across the markets as well. The Binance Coin price is moving up nicely, although it is taking a slow and steady approach first and foremost. It is evident the cryptocurrency industry is still in a good place right now, especially with most of the top markets shifting into the green zone again. While some stability would also be appreciated, most traders prefer to see some gains at any given time. It appears Binance Coin has users covered in this regard, primarily because it tends to note some gains in quick succession at all times. Today is no different in that regard, albeit the market isn\u2019t moving up as swiftly as people expected. Over the past 24 hours, the Binance Coin price has risen by 1% in USD and ETH value, and 0.77% in Bitcoin value. While all of these trends are somewhat promising in their own regard, it remains to be seen if they can be sustained for very long. As the value approaches $15.9 again, a push to $16 again is not entirely out of the question. Considering how the trading volume is still relatively low, however, that may require a bit of extra effort first and foremost. On social media, there are many different discussions pertaining to BNB. Some users would love to see Binance build a better Coinmarketcap, as that site has gotten a lot of flack in the past twelve months. It now seems something will need to change in this regard, although it is unclear what role BNB would play in that regard. There are plenty of CMC alternatives out there already, although some of those still derive incorrect market data from that site in the end. When it comes to the current price charts, however, it remains to be seen what will happen next. CryptoandChill expects BNB to pull back to $12 in the coming days, which would require a very bearish turn of events all of a sudden. It is not entirely impossible this market would lose 25% in value for no apparent reason, but at this time, that scenario seems implausible. Depending on how far one would zoom out on the chart, it quickly becomes apparent BNB is still mega bullish. Any level of resistance to date has been wiped out pretty quickly, although there is still a good chance this last set of green candles will be undone in quick succession. Although Binance Coin tends to do its own thing first and foremost, there is no market which rises in value for an extended period of time without facing price drop. All of the signs seem to indicate things will get very interesting for all top cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets. Although Binance Coin is gaining a lot less value than one might assume, there is nothing to be overly concerned about as of right now. This current uptrend should not face too many problems as long as Bitcoin remains in the green. However, anything can happen in this volatile industry.

While there are some interesting price changes taking place right now, few currencies note nay real bullish momentum. The Huobi Token price, on the other hand, has noted very strong gains all week long and seemingly continues down the same path without too much resistance. Holders of Huobi Token will be quite pleased with the way the value of their token is going lately. After what seemed to be an extended period of sideways trading, HT suddenly decided to break out a few days ago. So far, the momentum hasn\u2019t let up, as today\u2019s gains clearly illustrate. In this day and age, tokens associated with popular crypto exchanges all tend to do quite well, it would appear. Over the past 24 hours, the Huobi Token price has increased by another 14.5% in USD, BTC, and ETH value alike. These gains push the value to $2.52, 62,234 Satoshi, or 0.0148 Ether. A very interesting turn of events, as Huobi is not talked about that often in comparison to some other big trading platforms. There is also a heavy increase in HT trading volume right now, as its volume has surpassed the Huobi Token market cap. Speaking of trading volume, Huobi Global is not the only place noting an increase in HT trading. LBank and Gate.io are both in the top 4 as well with their USDT pairs. This is in line with what happens on Huobi Global, as the USDT pair on that platform is also generating the most volume. It is evident this price run may continue for quite some time to come, as there doesn\u2019t appear to be any real price resistance to contend with at this time. On social media, it seems some traders are ready to ditch Huobi Token and look for greener pastures. Klondike confirmed their Telegram channel called out HT a while ago and took a lot of profit in the process. With the position now almost entirely liquidated, it may be a good time to look at other markets in search of further profits. It will be interesting to see how this will affect the overall HT momentum over the coming hours and days. For those merely interested in the price chart, even Huobi Global seems to confirm things are not looking that promising in terms of sustaining this uptrend. While there are clearly strong gains in HT/USDT, it would appear this momentum may not remain in place for very long. Depending on what happens to Bitcoin and the HT trading volume, the coming hours will prove to be rather interesting. No massive setback is to be expected at this time, but one never knows what the future will hold. As is always the case in this strange and volatile industry, making sense of individual markets is difficult, if not nigh impossible. For Huobi Token, an interesting trend has formed. Hardly ever does one see a market generate more trading volume than its overall market cap. Only time will tell if that is a good thing for HT, as there is a good chance that aspect may come back to harm this particular market before the day is over.

With Bitcoin still on what appears to be wobbly legs, it seems things will not necessarily pop off in a significant manner. The Tezos price, on the other hand, is making quite a few inroads as of right now. Its weak trading volume is a bit of a problem when it comes to sustaining these trends. When most of the top cryptocurrencies are capable of barely noting any gains these days, it seems unlikely things will improve for lower-cap alternative markets right now. There will always be some exceptions in this regard, as Tezos is a clear example of how things can evolve when people least expect it. While its current price trend is somewhat promising, most people will readily agree it is not sustainable for very long. To put this in perspective, there is a 17% gain in both USD and BTC value alike. This pushes the Tezos price back to $0.578, or 14,289 Satoshi. While most holders and speculators will be quite happy with the way things are going right now, it seems there isn\u2019t too much XTZ trading going on at this time. With just $8.21m in trades, there isn\u2019t any real momentum to support this uptrend for more than a few hours on end. On social media, it would appear there is some degree of excitement when it comes to Tezos as of right now. Especially when it comes to the \u201cbaking\u201d aspect of Tezos, things are starting to heat up in recent weeks. There is also an associated meme regarding this particular process, although one could argue it may not necessarily matter all that much in the end. Those who are looking closely at the XTZ price chart will notice there is a very strong and swift uptrend. As has been the case in this industry for quite some time now, such steep gains materializing without any genuine reason for it will usually result in a retrace. Nico is quite happy with the quick 10% profit, but it is evident buying in now is a major risk. Earlier today, it also seemed as if Tezos would overtake ZCash in terms of market cap, albeit that is no longer the case. At this time, ZEC is %$20m ahead in market cap of Tezos, which seems to indicate this \u201cflip\u201d was not meant to last all that long. It is an interesting aspect to keep an eye on, but it seems unlikely Tezos will even the market cap top 20 anytime soon. All things considered, it would appear Tezos is trying to dig itself out of a hole all of a sudden. While that is a commendable course of action first and foremost, this massive uptrend in quick succession seems rather unstable. Combined with very weak trading volume, it would appear there will be some sort of correction in the very near future. However, XTZ can be a bit of an odd market in this regard, thus anything can happen. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Ever since this market hit the 40 Satoshi level, traders have expected the momentum to return sooner rather than later. So far, that hasn\u2019t happened whatsoever, as the Holo price seemingly remains bearish. There are some signs on the horizon this may come to change fairly soon. It is evident not all of the alternative cryptocurrency markets do well when Bitcoin is trying to move up once again. More often than not, the smaller cap markets will lose value in BTC first and foremost. Holo certainly falls into that category more often than not, although it remains to be seen if that situation can be turned around in the near future. Considering how there is some positive momentum brewing right now, it quickly becomes apparent anything can happen throughout the day. Over the past 24 hours, the Holo price has managed to break even in the USD department. That in itself is rather interesting, as it will not necessarily get many people excited. The 0.15% loss in BTC value is offset by a 0.09% gain in Ether. As such, the current price of $0.001164 is seemingly more than fair, although it may try to rise to $0.0012 unless Bitcoin turns incredibly bearish again for no apparent reason. Combined with a somewhat decent trading volume, it seems Holo is in a good place at this time. On social media, there are some interesting discussions to keep an eye on. MikeS has hopes the BTC Markets team will enable support for Holo in the future, although the team has not confirmed that will be the case. In fact, they only mentioned XLM will be added next, yet the mention of Holo has either been ignored, or they simply have no plans of doing so at this time. Approaching service providers to bring more exposure to a specific project is never a bad thing, though. XRP Nurse highlights one of the downsides of Holo, although this could easily apply to many other cryptocurrencies, assets, and tokens as well. It is certainly somewhat complex to move Holo onto a Ledger hardware wallet, although there are ways of solving this problem with a bit of research. If any of the developments would be interested in streamlining this process as much as possible, they could make life easier for a lot of people in the process. Last but not least, there is some price discussion as well. Holo has become rather popular among Turkish cryptocurrency traders as of late. Yavuz Selim Yildiz expects to see Holo break out again in the future, although it is evident the Holo has performed better than some other tokens as well. Based on the current market momentum, no imminent breakout should be expected. However, the developments happening behind the scenes may make their mark on the price moving forward. All things considered, Holo seems to be in a good place despite the lack of a clear price direction. That is not necessarily a bad thing, as price stability is often undervalued in this particular industry. If the trading volume were to pick up once again, there is a good chance the price momentum will turn in a more telling direction as well. A push to $0.0012 is not out of the question today, but there is always a chance the bearish trend will be resumed before the day is over. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While the majority of the top 10 is in the red, the Cardano price is moving up rather quickly. Its current gains seem promising, but breaking through the next key resistance level will prove to be very difficult first and foremost. As such, it remains to be seen if the day will end on a high for ADA. It is evident most of the top currencies will stand or fall based on what happens to Bitcoin. While it seems the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is doing its own thing without too many problems, there is still a fair bit of uneasy market momentum to contend with as well. As of right now, it would appear Cardano is trying to buck this seemingly negative trend, but it appears there will be some hurdles along the way to contend with. Over the past 24 hours, the Cardano price has risen by 3.9% in USD value and gained 3.6% over Bitcoin. Both of these developments are promising, as one ADA is now valued at $0.052032, or 1,288 Satoshi. The big question is whether or not this momentum can be sustained, and if further gains can be noted across the board. With $46.118m in trading volume, that may prove very difficult over the coming hours. The overall crypto trading volume is also still down, which could put additional pressure on all markets. On social media, there is some growing dismay regarding the surprise AMAs organized by Charles Hoskinson. Although these AMAs are pretty important for any cryptocurrency at this time, one also has to acknowledge the majority of community members is waiting for the Shelley release. Adding another \u201csurprise AMA\u201d to the list seems to delay that aspect in the minds of some people, even though that is not necessarily the case whatsoever. When looking at the current ADA chart, however, it quickly becomes apparent the coming few hours may be crucial. The 1,300 Satoshi level is considered to be a major resistance zone, and the price is approaching that level rather quickly. Assuming Cardano\u2019s uptrend is rejected at that level, there is a good chance the market will enter a slightly bearish phase for a little while. It will all depend on what happens to Bitcoin first and foremost. As can be seen in the Tweet by Casual Crypto, there is a good chance the retrace will drive the price back down to 1,250 Satoshi. It is not the biggest drop whatsoever, but there is no clear support above 1,270 Satoshi at this time. If the current prices can be maintained for an hour or two, there may be further buy support to keep this party going. For the time being, it seems unwise to expect any major Cardano uptrend in the near future. While the current momentum is somewhat promising, it wouldn\u2019t take much effort to erode all of these gains either. Remaining above $0.05 should not be too difficult, all things considered, but there isn\u2019t much to be overly excited about either at this point.

It is not entirely uncommon to see the top markets struggle a bit when the value of Bitcoin dips in the red all of a sudden. While no one knows for sure why this new wave of bearish pressure has materialized, it seems it could turn into a rough ride over the next few hours. XRP is also falling victim to this trend, albeit its losses are still very minimal at this point. Whether or not that will remain the case, is a different matter altogether. To put the current market sentiment in perspective, it seems the XRP price has lost 0.85% in USD value and 0.65% in BTC value. Neither of these trends is promising at this time, but it seems unlikely there won\u2019t be any major drops in price. With a current value of $0.3154, or 7,799 Satoshi, no actual damage has been done. The ongoing XRP/BTC downtrend is not exactly promising by any means, but things could always turn around on a dime. On social media, it would appear there are some interesting discussions pertaining to XRP. It is a bit uncanny how so many people have no idea CoiNGate processes XRP payments on behalf of corporate clients. Moreover, the company confirmed they have at least 5,000 businesses on their list at this time, which is pretty interesting to keep an eye on. How much XRP the company processes in terms of volume per month, has not been disclosed at this time. There are also a fair few XRP community members who are not too keen about being associated with \u201cbots\u201d. Todd, for example, is tired of being called a bit simply because he supports XRP. This is one of those types of discussions which won\u2019t lead to any changes, as XRP has been subjected to a lot of opposition for quite some time now. It seems unlikely that will come to change in the near future. For those who took a peek at the actual price chart, it would appear there is a lot of pressure on XRP across all fronts. Especially XRP/USD may remain very bearish for quite some time to come, especially if Bitcoin were to turn bearish for an extended period of time. It remains to be seen if that will be the case, but the current chart doesn\u2019t bode all that well. As is always the case in this volatile industry, there is a good chance this momentum will be temporary in nature first and foremost.

While the top markets still try to find their ground, it seems some of the lower-cap alternative ones are moving up. If the Kin price is an example of what awaits throughout the day, there could be a lot of surprising momentum in the coming hours. It is not entirely uncommon to see small cap altcoins move up in spectacular fashion after a bit of a dull weekend. While Kin is a potentially viable project, it has not been talked about all that often in recent weeks and months. That situation will undoubtedly change following this most recent price spike, although it remains to be seen how much higher the value can go, at least in Bitcoin value. Over the past 4 hours, the Kin price has noted a 21.4% gain in both USD and BTC value. There is an even bigger increase in KIN/ETH, although not that much. For now, one KIN is valued at $0.000048. or 1 Satoshi, or 35 Etheroshi. All of these values are respectable, yet it remains to be seen if and when this currency can hit its stride. Going from 1 Satoshi to 2 Satoshi might not seem difficult, but with a circulating supply of 756 billion KIN, that is not all that easy. As was to be expected, this sudden sharp price increase triggers a few interesting conversations on Twitter. MercatoX will support the Kin swap as the project transitions from the current ERC20 token to their own blockchain. This swap is another step toward ensuring this ecosystem remains viable at all times. Other exchanges will support the swap as well, although the exact date for this procedure has yet to be confirmed by all parties involved. There is also a somewhat older post on social media which seems tog et people excited. The Kin ecosystem is still being developed as of right now, which will require major partnerships and collaborations. For now, it seems things are progressing nicely in that regard, although hitting $0.019 per token may not necessarily happen anytime soon. It is something to look forward to if it happens, but right now, the current price level seems more than acceptable. As was to be expected at this point in time, a lot of traders expect Binance to list KIN at some point or other. It remains unlikely the company will go through this process in the short term, although their team will usually keep tabs on what is happening in this industry at all times. How that would affect Kin in the future, is impossible to predict at this time. All things considered, it seems Kin is doing exactly what traders had hoped for. That doesn\u2019t mean this uptrend will remain in place forever, although there doesn\u2019t appear to be that much pressure either. In KIN/BTC, the value can\u2019t go much lower than it is right now, yet there may be some pushback in KIN/ETH. For now, the only real problem is the trading volume, as $1.85m in trades is not spectacular. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Not all of the bearish pressure which materialized has disappeared, but things are not looking too bad either. The Stellar price is rebounding sharply after a rough day, and its value seems on track to hit $0.12 later in the day, assuming this price trend is sustainable. It is always interesting to see how different cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets try to evolve at any given time. Especially in the price department, it would appear the reliance on Bitcoin has become far less apparent recently than it normally is. This is not a bad thing by any means, but it also creates a bit more uncertainty which most markets do not need. For Stellar, it is working wonders right now, although some people may see things differently. Over the past 24 hours, Stellar is the strongest gainer in the entire top 10. Its 5.18% gain in USD value pushes the Stellar price back to $0.115. There is also a 4.75% gain in XLM/BTC, bringing that ratio back to 2,851 Satoshi. These solid gains all across the board seem to indicate things can get pretty interesting moving forward, although there is never a guarantee things will continue down this path for very long. On social media, the big news of the day is how Stellar has been tapped by IBM to launch a global payments network. While this development has been coming for quite some time now, it appears the circle is finally complete. It is possible this news is part of the reason why the Stellar value is rising all of a sudden, although other factors can be at play as well. There is also some concern as to how the rivalry between XRP and XLM will play out. XRPiano shares some interesting details, although they are not necessarily something to be concerned about. Stronghold did indeed remove a few different XLM pairs while adding XRP. However, the company also partnered with IBM to make use of its Stellar-based payments network. A bit of an odd turn of events, albeit one that seems to make sense to all parties involved. When looking at the current XLM price chart, a very interesting pattern shows up. More specifically, there is a major cup formation visible, which ha snow resulted in what appears to be a minuscule handle before the breakout occurred. This can be interpreted in many different ways, yet Umut Bey clearly sees it as a major bullish signal. All of the current market signs seem to indicate Stellar is a bullish market, although the opinions will obviously differ in this regard. With these strong gains and Bitcoin slightly gaining value as well, the coming hours can play out in many different ways. While nothing is ever set in stone in this volatile industry, one has to admit XLM looks somewhat strong and a push to $0.12 seems plausible. That doesn\u2019t mean it will happen, though.

The overall bearish momentum isn\u2019t intensive enough to trigger any major price changes at this point. Further down the rankings, it would seem the Electroneum price is trying to dig itself out a hole. The way ahead is still long, for obvious reasons. As far as the smaller cap altcoins are concerned, there is some interesting momentum taking place right now. While most of the top markets do not see much positive momentum right now, the altcoins tend to do their own thing more often than not. In the case of Electroneum, there is some positive momentum brewing across the board. It may go by unnoticed for today, though, as the differences are minimal. To put this in perspective, the Electroneum price notes a 0.3% gain in USD value and a 0.7% increase over Bitcoin Both of these promising trends push the value back up to $0.006534, or 162 Satoshi. While these are not the most spectacular gains, it may be the beginning of an uptrend. The trading volume for ETN has collapsed again, which was to be expected. It would appear some Electroneum enthusiasts are patiently waiting to see what the future will hold. Jack, for example, expects to see some price momentum ahead of or during May of 2019. It seems based on some statistics which would work in ETN\u2019s favor, although it remains to be seen if Bitcoin\u2019s block reward halving would impact ETN in any significant manner. Some users are also dismayed by Electroneum, which is not entirely surprising. Crypto Fraea expected more things from ETN and has now been sorely disappointed. A bit of an odd sentiment given the developments and milestones reached in the past few months. However, everyone can have their own opinion, as it is a free world. Last but not least, it would appear Electroneum is now officially supported on TradingView. It is not the biggest development, but traders will certainly benefit from this development. This could lead to more price charts for ETN being shared on social media, albeit that will not necessarily impact the price in any way. Any form of recognition is welcome for alternative cryptocurrencies. Although Electroneum is far from a bullish market at this stage, the current trend has some potential. Whether or not it will remain in place for more than an hour or two, will primarily depend on what happens to its trading volume. Without any notable increase in that department, it seems unlikely a big uptrend will materialize in the next 24 hours. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While Bitcoin reclaimed the $4,000 price level not that long ago, there are plenty of other developments to keep an eye on a swell. In a new update, the Cryptopia team confirms their exchange is back up and running, albeit in somewhat limited fashion. A lot of cryptocurrency enthusiasts were dismayed when Cryptopia announced their trading platform got hacked several months ago. While crypto exchange hacks are nothing new in this particular industry, Cryptopia has been at the center of attention ever since. Despite claims of an exit scam or a fake hack, the company has seemingly done everything they can to resolve this situation as quickly as possible. Even though the official investigation is still underway at this time, it seems the company has received the green light to resume operations. All clients who suffered from the recent hack received an email to warn them about the trading being resumed in the near future. After launching the site in read-only mode about a month ago, things have now returned to normal. Although there is still a lot of work to be done, things appear to be progressing in the right direction. One aspect of the recently issued message states: The introduction of this CLM token is not entirely surprising either. It was expected Cryptopia would try to recover the losses and refund affected customers in some way or another. It is also good to see the company confirm it cannot be traded on the platform \u2013 yet \u2013 as that would cause a lot of friction first and foremost. This also seems to be a good way to keep customers up-to-date regarding the progress associated with recovering the stolen funds. How they will handle things from a legal perspective, is a different matter altogether. For the time being, Cryptopia users will able to trade 40 different cryptocurrencies through their respective trading pairs in Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin. Although the platform supports more coins than just this list, those markets will be reopened at a later undisclosed date. It is an important first step in the right direction to keep users happy and engaged. However, exchange enthusiasts also have to keep in mind the company is still in the process of clearing up a lot of loose ends, thus no miracles should be expected. A lot of cryptocurrency traders will be happy to see Cryptopia is coming back. Other companies suffering from exchange hacks have not been as fortunate to resume their services in the end. As the platform starts to generate revenue again, they should be able to start repaying affected users as well. All things considered, it seems things are coming together for the company. One can only hope their platform is now more secure than ever before, as another hack could be catastrophic for this exchange.", "date": "2019-03-19T09:15:13+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 19}

While the top markets are still all over the place, there is still some bearish pressure to contend with as well. The XRP price is still in the red, and most traders seemingly expect it to drop further to $0.31. Not s good start of the week, but the current trend may not allow that lower level to be hit. While most people expected the XRP value to buck the bearish trend over the weekend, it seems that has not happened as of yet. While the current losses are not too bothersome to contend with whatsoever, it is evident there may not be an uptrend for some to come. That will displease a lot of holders and traders, yet there isn\u2019t much one can do about it under these current circumstances. Over the past 24 hours, there is a 0.3% loss in USD value and a 0.2% loss in BTC value for XRP. While that doesn\u2019t warrant any optimism whatsoever, it is unlikely to cause any panic selling either. With the current XRP price still sitting at $0.316951, or 7,898 Satoshi, everything seems to be in order. However, there is some concern over XRP/BTC, which is seemingly not intent on returning to the 8,000 Satoshi level anytime soon. Even so, anything can change in this volatile industry. On social media, there is a fair bit of unrest where XRP is concerned. Mr. Ripple sees this as a mere continuation of the sideways trading momentum, which has been in place for quite some time. It would appear there is still some minor upward momentum in place when zooming out on the chart, although it can easily turn into a bearish trend if no positive changes are noted. Pinca is growing concerned over how XRP is going up so slowly, and even fails to note any real gains at this time. Claiming this is another sign of market manipulation is a stretch too far, though. The \u201cmanipulation\u201d word is thrown quite a lot of this industry, even though it hardly ever seems to apply. As such, it seems XRP is merely following Bitcoin\u2019s trend, which is to be expected. For those users who look at the current price chart, it quickly becomes apparent there may not be too much of an XRP uptrend in the foreseeable future. XRPilkington looks at the four-hour chart and expects further bearish momentum to drive the price down to $0.31. That should, in theory, be the final push down prior to bouncing back strongly, although no official price target has been shared with the rest of the world. All of the market signs look rather bearish where XRP is concerned. Not too many traders should be surprised by this, as this situation will not change if Bitcoin turns bullish again. Even when that happens, it seems rather likely the XRP/BTC ratio will remain under pressure for quite some time to come. There is some intriguing market momentum to look forward to, but it might not be too pretty when it materializes. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While there is some excitement in certain markets, the top currencies are rather disappointing right now. The Enjin Coin price, which recently saw a major value surge, is still going strong as of right now. No one will be too surprised to note some altcoins succeed in noting strong gains whereas the majority of the top coins are struggling. While projects such as Enjin Coin would certainly benefit from bullish Bitcoin price momentum, it seems they can effectively move on their own as well. That is part of what cryptocurrency so interesting right now, as one never knows where the next batch of profits might come from. Over the past 24 hours, it would appear there is a 21% increase in the Enjin Coin price. More importantly, this is an uptrend which affects the USD, BTC, and ETH value alike, further confirming the uptrend is going strong. Because of this new surge, one ENJ is valued at $0.201, 5,004 Satoshi, or 0.00144592 Ether. A very promising turn of events, even though most holders recently noted some strong gains as well. When looking at social media, it would appear there is some interesting information pertaining to Enjin Coin. Quantza would love to see Binance.je add Enjin Coin. That would make things rahte ritneresting, a sit cna provide a lot more epxosure for ENJ in the process. Getting the word out about different altcoins is usually very difficult, yet it seems there are ways to make this process a lot more straightforward. It also appears Binance has plans to conduct an AMA with altcoin developer teams through their own Telegram channel. Enjin Coin is one of the options to vote on, as are Holo, Aion, and others. This seems to indicate Binance knows all too well what ENJ is about, although one shouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions right away. An AMA for any of the listed coins would certainly yield some excitement, as this kind of exposure can be invaluable. For those merely interested in the actual price chart, it seems things are looking promising, but not without potential price pressure. VIP25 Crypto Coin Analysis claims a pullback to 5,000 Satoshi is possible, which is in line with the current value. However, breaking the resistance at 6,100 Satoshi will be a massive challenge. Altcoin markets remain rather unpredictable, even under the best of circumstances. What makes Enjin Coin a rather remarkable market is how it notes almost as much trading volume as its current market cap valuation. With most of the trading coming from UpBit, Bithumb, and Binance, it seems there may be more of the same for the foreseeable future. How high the price will go, remains to be determined, as there may be some bearish pressure in the near future. Such steep gains can hardly ever be sustained without any repercussions.

In the case of the Binance Coin price, the positive momentum has not dried up entirely just yet. There is a chance BNB will overtake Bitcoin Cash in market cap, depending on how things evolve for Bitcoin and the likes. A push through to $16 is not out of the question either. It is evident most of the top markets are under a fair bit of bearish pressure at this time. This means today will not necessarily be the most profitable day for trading or buying cryptocurrencies, assets, and tokens. There will always be exceptions to take note of, such as Binance Coin. Regardless of the overall market trend, this asset seems to be dancing to its own beat. Even today, it successfully bucks the negative price trend. Over the past 24 hours, the Binance Coin price has successfully maintained its minor bullish trend without too many problems. A net gain of 2.5% in USD value brings the price to $15.82. There is also a 3.2% gain over Bitcoin and a 4.4% improvement over Ethereum. All of these trends are very promising, for obvious reasons, although there is a good chance this momentum will slowly become less bullish if Bitcoin remains as bearish as it is right now. A very peculiar image has surfaced on social media, although no one knows for sure whether or not it is a genuine picture. It depicts a football with the Binance logo, which may lead to some interesting marketing efforts over the next few months. One user even goes as far as suggesting Binance should look into sponsoring the World Cup of 2022. That seems highly unlikely, primarily because the event takes place in Qatar. That region isn\u2019t necessarily known for its pro-Bitcoin stance, although no outspoken negativity can be noted either. For those who prefer a more technical analysis of what is happening to BNB, things will get interesting. Krypto Wave Trader expects a massive retrace in the coming few hours, although that seems rather unlikely given the current overall market momentum. However, it remains to be seen if there will be a continuation of this uptrend later today, as that remains difficult to predict at this time. Bagsy is a different creature in this regard, albeit this user confirms Binance Coin still looks bullish without too many problems. It is remarkable to see this project push through without that much effort, whereas Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are bleeding value all over the place. That doesn\u2019t mean Binance Coin will escape this negative trend unscathed, although it seems to be faring quite well at this time. There are many different opinions on Binance Coin and whether or not its value is correct. Some people feel this token is overpriced, whereas others will undoubtedly claim it should be worth $50 or more. As long as BNB continues to do its own thing regardless of the overall market momentum, a push to $16 is not necessarily that difficult to achieve. Anything beyond that will probably remain off-limits from a short-term perspective. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Although there are some minor casualties to take note of, the Ontology price continues its prominent rise to the top 15 by market cap. When it comes to the different and numerous altcoin markets accessible today, they usually tend to follow Bitcoin\u2019s momentum for better or worse. As Bitcoin is still in a somewhat bullish phase since surpassing $4,000, it is all the more logical to see the top altcoins move up in similar fashion. Ontology, a recent entrant in the market cap top 20, has successfully maintained its position in recent weeks, Today, the altcoin seems poised to move up the ladder. Over the past few hours, there has been an interesting Ontology price increase. With a 5.7% increase in USD value, one ONT is now priced at $1.07. There is also a 3.4% gain on Bitcoin, pushing that value to 26,473 Satoshi. Both trends are very promising at this time, and they can seemingly be sustained with the current trading volume. That in itself can be interpreted as a bullish signal by some hopefuls. Speaking of trading volume, Ontology notes just over $56.1m in trades today. Most of that volume comes from Bit-Z, Huobi Global, and Binance. The first two pairs are linked to USDT, whereas Binance\u2019s BTC market is delivering the goods. Interestingly enough, Ontology has four other USDT pairs in the top 7, which is rather unusual for altcoins. The sentiment on social media seems to be rather indecisive. Posty, for example, is cautious despite the promising upward momentum. It is certainly true this market can either break out or pull back in quick succession. Chasing the top is not necessarily a valid strategy where altcoins are concerned, and it seems some people are finally getting that message. Higher Highs, on the other hand, allowed FOMO to cloud his judgment a bit. Although the investment has seemingly paid off already, it is also a risky move. One can understand why one who recently made good money with Litecoin would expect similar results from Ontology. So far, so good, but everything remains up in the air at this point. All things considered, today is shaping up to be a very intriguing day of trading for all cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets. Even Ontology is reaping the rewards from this overall bullish momentum, which further confirms anything can happen over the next 48 hours. How high this altcoin will go, is very difficult to predict. A potential retrace may occur sooner than people expect. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Despite a lot of positive momentum brewing, the hourly charts look increasingly bleak for all of the top markets. For now, the Dogecoin price has not lost any real value in the process, but that situation may change fairly soon. The losses in DOGE/BTC put a lot of pressure on this particular market as of right now. Although the weekend is usually a terrible period to trade cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets, this week may offer something entirely different. A lot of traders will be pleased with the way things are going right now, primarily because most of these gains were completely unexpected at this time. Even so, the current profits could be wiped out rather easily, primarily because Bitcoin is looking pretty bleak on the hourly chart. Over the past 24 hours, the Dogecoin price damage has been contained for the most part. In fact, the USD value has risen by 1.4%, which is a pretty interesting trend. Because of this uptrend, one DOGE is still valued at $0.002. However, there is a 0.8% decrease in DOGE/BTC, as a 0.8% setback has been recorded in this department. This is not necessarily a promising turn of events, at the 50-50 Satoshi range will come under a lot of pressure. On social media, most of the Dogecoin-related discussions pertain to the price. That is only normal, even though some of the advice issued earlier today by Ryan Treadwell is no longer viable at this time. It seems a lot of the top currencies are already on the retrace right now, which means things could get gnarly for Dogecoin over the coming hours. It could still be a good time to buy DOGE, though. One of the main advantages Dogecoin brings to the table is how it is both fast and cheap to use for transactions. So much even that virtually any amount can be transacted for $0.0002 in fees or even less. That in itself is very different from Bitcoin or most other cryptocurrencies. However, it may not necessarily be a primary reason for a DOGE price change, either for better or worse. While Dogecoin is best known for its memes, it does appear the \u201cDoge for President\u201d campaign is interesting to keep an eye on. While clearly intended as a joke, one has to keep in mind the \u2018artwork\u201d floating around on the internet is making quite an impact. Depending on how one feels about the current political climate in the US, Doge for President in 2020 might not necessarily be such a bad idea whatsoever. All of the signs seem to indicate most of the positive cryptocurrency market momentum will be wiped out sooner or later this weekend. For the time being, it seems Dogecoin might remain in the clear for some time to come. That doesn\u2019t necessarily include the DOGE/BTC ratio, which is already facing a growing amount of pressure.

All top markets also depict bearish hourly charts, which is only adding more proverbial fuel to the fire. Even the Ethereum price, which recently surpassed $140 again, is facing a fair bit of uninvited pressure. It is only normal to see some of the excitement ebb away when the weekend comes around. Yesterday offered a lot of promising momentum, and even today things are not looking all that bad. However, there is also a growing amount of bearish pressure, which is only to be expected. For Ethereum, it is unclear what will come next, although there is nothing to be overly concerned about at this time. Over the past 24 hours, the net result for Ethereum is still positive. With a 3.14% increase, the Ethereum price sits at $141.84, which is higher than expected. There is also a 1% increase in ETH/BTC, which will be crucial in terms of maintaining these US Dollar gains if Bitcoin were to turn bearish again. Ethereum is also one of the few top altcoins to maintain gains over Bitcoin at this time of day. On social media, there are a lot of interesting debates regarding Ethereum at this time. Delphi Digital recently released their detailed report on Ethereum, which touches upon many different factors of this ecosystem. It is interesting to see how it focuses on the short-term and long-term, outlook, as well as the roadmap and key risks. An interesting read, although people are still advised to draw their own conclusions. It would also seem a lot of people are looking at the Ethereum value chart from a completely different perspective. User OMG.NinjaForex claims how Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum usually rise in value over the weekend before dropping in value during the next week. Today is not necessarily the same, as there is a growing amount of bearish pressure affecting all of these markets. The main question this weekend is whether or not Ethereum will find the necessary support levels to keep this momentum going. The current chart seems to indicate a massive resistance level has been triggered, which may lead to its ultimate demise in terms of short-term gains. The coming hours will be very interesting to keep an eye on in that regard. As is always the case, there is a good chance this bearish momentum will only cause a brief intermission. All markets look healthy and note very high trading volumes, for a weekend. If this trend keeps up, it is possible Ethereum will hit $145 before the weekend is over.

For Ethereum, there is a lot of pressure to contend with. Part of the reason is Bitcoin\u2019s decline, but there is also some concern over the implementation of ProgPoW. For now, the Ethereum price remains above $140, albeit just barely. When Bitcoin starts to lose value \u2013 albeit ever so slightly \u2013 it usually doesn\u2019t take long for all of the alternative markets to go down in price as well. While these losses may not necessarily remain in place for a long time, it puts another wave of pressure on all markets. Such momentum is very common during the weekend, as Saturdays and Sundays are usually synonymous with portfolio losses. This weekend has not bucked that trend, despite some initial excitement on Saturday morning. As far as the Ethereum price is concerned, the momentum isn\u2019t too promising today. There is a net 2% loss in USD value and a 1.25% decrease in ETH/BTC. Because of this bearish pressure, the Ethereum value has dropped to just above $140 or 0.0349 BTC. On paper, there is nothing to worry about whatsoever, but it seems likely the value of one ETH will drop below $140 if this trend remains in place for much longer. It would appear there is some debate as to whether or not the Ethereum developers should implement ProgPoW in a future hard fork. While the developers have confirmed this change is coming, the community has never been too big of a fan of this particular proposal. Major changes like these can help advance the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole, although it will upset some miners in the process. As long as Ethereum remains reliant on mining, keeping the miners happy needs to be the main priority. Although ProgPoW will upset the balance of Ethereum mining a bit, it remains unclear when it will be introduced. For now, the developers have allegedly confirmed it will occur in \u201ca future hard fork\u201d without going into any specific details. Keeping in mind how Ethereum still has a \u201cdifficulty bomb\u201d to contend with, it is evident ProgPoW may help ease the transition from PoW to PoS in the next few years to come. On social media, there is some excitement regarding the current crypto market trend, although not necessarily in a good way. Jan Groenen, for example, expects Bitcoin to drop below $4,000 again, which would also send Ethereum\u2019s price below $140 in rather quick succession. It will be interesting to see if this vision can come true, For now, it seems to be a matter of time until that change happens, although one never knows what the future will hold. All things considered, it seems logical to assume the Ether value will drop below $140 fairly soon. How long that situation will remain in place, is a different matter altogether. Most of the Ethereum value changes will depend on Bitcoin\u2019s price evolution. So far, things do not look too promising, but there is always a chance the situation will improve fairly quickly.

The Tron price, while still under pressure, may very well see a rebound fairly soon. Its losses in BTC value are nearly gone, which should allow the USD value to recover a bit of lost ground as well. It is always interesting to see how individual cryptocurrency projects evolve as more time progresses. The fewer projects rely on Bitcoin\u2019s price momentum first and foremost, the healthier the ecosystem will become. As far as Tron is concerned, it remains to be seen what role Bitcoin\u2019s price momentum plays exactly. More often than not, it would appear as if Tron couldn\u2019t care less about what Bitcoin offers. This is also evident when looking at the Tron price momentum over the past 24 hours. A net loss of 0.9% in USD value is not positive, but it is not necessarily insurmountable either. There is also the 0.5% loss over Bitcoin, which is slightly more promising. More specifically, if these losses can be nullified, there is a chance the USD value will bounce back from its current level of $0.023237. Reaching 600 Satoshi may prove to be a bigger challenge, though. It has to be said, the developments taking place in the Tron ecosystem are looking promising. Over 12 million smart contract triggers have been executed over the past two weeks. While not necessarily a determining factor, it is something to keep an eye on moving forward. Combined with the overall excitement regarding Tron in general, it seems to indicate this ecosystem continues to grow by leaps and bounds. Speaking of innovation and the Tron ecosystem, the number of dApps continues to increase. Alongside it, the TRX volume across these distributed applications is also on the rise. By actively surpassing $100m in 24-hour volume, things are getting pretty interesting. This growth shows there is a lot of potential waiting to be unlocked, even though dApps are always a bit of a niche trend among cryptocurrency users first and foremost. Even when things are going well in the Tron ecosystem, it seems there will be those who oppose the project at any possible turn. Even the recently shared Tron-themed mug on social media draws comments such as \u201cTron is a shitcoin\u201d. There is a good reason why no one can have nice things in the cryptocurrency world, and this sums up that reason quite perfectly. All things considered, there is a lot to be excited about when it comes to Tron. Even though the current price might not necessarily reflect this positive momentum, there is nothing to be overly concerned about at this time. If the TRX/BTC losses can be overturned, there is a good chance things will improve pretty quickly. This bearish trend during the weekend is not an indicator of what may come next week either.

It now seems another rumor is spreading, although it seems unlikely to have any major impact. A new set of cryptocurrency-oriented guidelines has been announced in Mexico, which leads many people to believe crypto will be banned. That is far from the case, as the guidelines are not even official yet, nor do they mention any \u201cban\u201d either. As is always the case when a proposal regarding cryptocurrencies are other forms of virtual money are concerned, there will be some misunderstandings. As can be seen from the original document issued by officials, there are some potential changes on the horizon. While most crypto enthusiasts may not necessarily be too happy with this turn of events and change in general, it would appear the guidelines are not official at this time. While the proposed changes will certainly impact cryptocurrency service providers, it is a stretch to say Mexican officials want to ban Bitcoin and similar currencies. Every government around the world is looking at this form of money and will attempt to regulate it in the end. Those rules, while putting some people\u2019s minds at ease, will not necessarily have any long-term impact on the cryptocurrency industry either. In fact, Bitso has already stated that, if these guidelines are turned into law, their business will not necessarily be impacted. The company sees no problems in terms of offering its existing services and potentially even expanding upon them in the future. That in itself shows any claims of \u201cMexico banning cryptocurrency\u201d is blown out of proportion by quite a margin. Unlike some other countries, Mexico is seemingly taking a more level-headed approach to this particular industry. For the time being, the new guidelines proposed by Banxico will remain subject to public commentary. Any Mexican cryptocurrency enthusiasts having concerns regarding these guidelines is advised to effectively voice their concerns through the proper channels. While there may be some growth stagnation during the initial stage of these new guidelines \u2013 assuming they are ever approved \u2013 that hurdle can be overcome without any real problems. There is one particular aspect of these guidelines to take into account. In late 2018, Mexico introduced the Fintech Law. As an innovative framework, this platform was designed to foster collaboration between service providers, regulators, and the government. Unfortunately, the proposal by Banxico seems to ignore most of that \u201cgoodwill\u201d outright, which might lead to the guidelines being amended following the public feedback period. Rest assured the involved parties will review these guidelines in the coming eighty-plus days. After that time, the feedback will need to be reviewed and potential amendments introduced. The central bank of Mexico carries a lot of weight, yet it seems they have no real intention of preventing the use of cryptocurrencies at this time. It will be an interesting discussion to keep an eye on, although no real \u201cverdict\u201d is expected in the next few months. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Nor are there spectacular losses to take note of, although that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean these markets are in a good place right now. The Cardano price has risen the strongest out of the entire top 15 so far, which seems to indicate a lot of interesting things are happening in that market at this time. It is not entirely uncommon to see most of the top crypto markets deal with some uneasy momentum. This situation has been in place for quite some time now, which is still a direct result of the 2018 bear market. Even in early 2019, that bearish pressure always seems to loom overhead, for some reason. Cardano is not affected by this particular development at this time, which is promising in its own right. Sustaining this uptrend will be a different matter, with the weekend around the corner. To put this in perspective, the Cardano price has risen by 5.7% in both USD and BTC value alike. That in itself is rather interesting to keep an eye on, primarily because so many other top markets note gains of 1.5% or less. Cardano\u2019s current value approaches the $0.05 level again, which may prove to be a new support level or a major hindrance. Either scenario is still in play at this time. On social media, the Ledger support for Cardano is seemingly far less important than the actual price charts. That is a sign of how this bullish run may come to a halt fairly soon. Crypto Wunderbear expects this run to improve even further, assuming Bitcoin doesn\u2019t spoil the party. It is evident Cardano relies on Bitcoin quite a bit right now, which can prove to be very problematic in the long run. Nerubica, on the other hand, remains a bit on the fence as to how this price run will play out. Considering how there is nothing to be overly excited about as of yet, it seems this small nudge can easily be squashed. ADA\u2019s Trading volume is also far from impressive, although that particular aspect has not been of too great concern to traders and holders in recent months. With the $0.05 level within reach, there may be a minor push in terms of trading volume over the coming days. Some traders always try to make the best of the current situation. BitcoinBethke, for example, expects ADA to hit 1m330 Satoshi, which would require another 7% increase compared to the current level. However, this user also indicates it to be a short-term target, which may result in a new decrease shortly afterward. Cryptocurrencies are volatile first and foremost, with Cardano not being an exception in this regard. Although it is somewhat promising to see Cardano\u2019s value rise while other markets struggle for traction, getting ahead of oneself is never a good sign either. For now, the lack of high trading volume and the main focus on the price, rather than actual developments, can make this a rather short-lived uptrend as long as Bitcoin remains on shaky legs. It could make for a very interesting market to keep an eye on over the weekend, though. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

With most of the top markets in the green, a promising tone ahead of the weekend has been set. However, there is a chance everything will fall apart sooner or later. Until that happens, there is a good chance the Litecoin price momentum will push its value to $60. It is always good to see currencies that are not Bitcoin moving up in quick succession. For the time being, most of the top markets fall into this category, although the overall momentum is still rather uneasy. Despite noting some mid-sized gains, most currencies are heavily reliant on Bitcoin\u2019s price momentum first and foremost. Litecoin may not be an exception in this regard, although it seems to be holding its own quite well. Over the past 24 hours, the Litecoin price has noted a strong gain in both USD and BTC value alike. Following a 3% gain, one LTC is now priced at just under $58. The LTC/BTC ratio improved to 0.01466 BTC, which is something worth keeping an eye on as well. Combined with the almost standard trading volume of over $1.8bn, it seems Litecoin is in a good place to keep the momentum going for some time to come. It would appear this LTC price momentum triggers some interesting discussions on Twitter. Jimmy Z claims Litecoin is on its way to hit $75 in the near future. While that is always a possibility, there is still a lot of work to be done first and foremost. If Litecoin can reach $60, things will get very interesting over the weekend. However, if Bitcoin were to turn bearish, everything goes out of the window. A completely different opinion is provided by Bitcoins Life. This particular user expects a major Litecoin crash to occur in the near future. There may be a push to $60 or even $65 before it happens, though. It is evident this user sees no point in any currency that isn\u2019t Bitcoin, although that much could be derived from looking at the name on social media. For those users who are not too concerned about the current Litecoin value and simply want to make money first and foremost, there is an appealing Litecoin arbitrage option to look into. With a potential profit of up to 99%, it is one of the most lucrative options to come by in recent weeks. It does require users to rely on Livecoin, Gate, and BitBns, which might not be the most appealing course of action. All of these signs seem to indicate Litecoin is in a good place at this time. While it remains to be determined how long this momentum will remain in place, there is no reason to expect any real turn of events. Considering how Bitcoin is in the green as of right now, there may be further positive market momentum. The weekend will be quite interesting to keep an eye on for many different reasons.

For the time being, there are some projects which note strong gains, whereas others are still uncertain about their future direction. The Holo price is surging once again, which is a welcome sight for holders after a few rough days. It is not uncommon for altcoins to come under pressure when Bitcoin is turning rather bullish out of the blue. That scenario doesn\u2019t always apply to all alternative markets, which is only to be expected. Right now, it would appear Holo is moving up rather nicely, primarily because it doesn\u2019t note any losses over Bitcoin As long as that situation remains in place, there is a good chance this price run could continue for a while longer. Over the past 24 hours, the Holo price has undergone some peculiar changes. More specifically, there is a 14% gain in USD value, a 10% gain over Bitcoin, and a 7% increase over Ethereum. All of these changes are incredibly promising for this altcoin, assuming they can be sustained. That will mainly hinge on whether or not the $13.2m in trading volume will act as support or turn into ballast dragging the price down. For now, it seems to be doing the job, as the Holo value reached 30 Satoshi once again. On social media, there is a lot of excitement regarding the current HOT price trend. That is only normal, as there are quite a few bag holders who bought in after or during the previous price rush. Dr. Holo, for example, is pleased to see Holo rise so strongly after a rough week. When people get overly excited about such gains, however, there is a good chance the momentum will sour pretty quickly. For those who are interested in the actual price chart, it would appear things continue to look promising. As long as the 27-28 Satoshi level remains in place as support, there is a chance to push through to 33 Satoshi later today. That is where the resistance will meet the buy support, and the fireworks could potentially begin. It is still unclear whether or not this push can remain in place for some time to come, though. Any cryptocurrency rising in value right now needs a good meme to keep people\u2019s spirits up. Holo has such a meme which features an interesting bit from the Zoolander movie. Although this meme could virtually apply to any cryptocurrency, it seems to fit Holo \u2013 or HOT \u2013 a lot better. Memes like these show the cryptocurrency community is still rather creative, despite a lot of bearish pressure in the past 18 months. All things considered, Holo looks to be in a very good place right now. With the gains across USD, BTC, and ETH value firmly in place, it would appear things could get even more interesting over the next few hours. While the volume also looks decent, a bit more trading volume has never hurt anyone whatsoever. The main question is whether or not Holo is capable of producing more trading volume during a weekend, as that is usually a major struggle for any altcoin.

While this momentum can still turn around on time, it seems Bitcoin\u2019s solid gains will allow alternative markets to remain in the green. As far as the XRP price is concerned, it would appear the current gain is solid, especially now that its value surpassed $0.32 once again. When the value of Bitcoin rises, it usually doesn\u2019t take too long until all of the other markets follow suit in quick succession. Today is such a day where this correlation between different markets becomes all the more evident. Because of the solid Bitcoin gains, it seems XRP is moving up fairly quickly as well. This is a very promising trend, all things considered, although there is still a long way to go. Over the past 24 hours, the net result for XRP is hopeful. Following a 3.08% increase in USD value, the XRP price now sits at $0.3217. The downside is how another minor XRP/BTC loss occurred, as that ratio is incapable of reclaiming the 8,000 Satoshi level yet again. While this will dismay a fair few traders, it seems unlikely it will spoil the overall positive mode. XRP has also managed to pick up the pace in trading volume, albeit ever so slightly. On social media, it is somewhat uncommon to find any solid trading advice at this time. Edwin de Haas, however, sums up the core sentiment of cryptocurrency trading quite well. While it remains to be seen if anyone will take this advice to heart in the coming months, it does appear things are progressing in that direction for most markets. Not chasing pumps is always the smarter course of action. When looking at the actual price chart, it would appear things could easily head in either direction. More specifically, the recent XRP uptrend has been pretty interesting to keep an eye on, yet it is rather apparent this uptrend is still on wobbly legs. Not because Bitcoin might fall apart, however likely that may seem. Instead, there is seemingly a lot of XRP resistance on the charts. It does not happen all that often a meme is presented to the XRP community. Today is rather a remarkable day in this regard, although it is a meme that will undoubtedly create some friction among community members as well. Even so, there is a case to be made in this regard, primarily because this steep uptrend will usually be appreciated without a second thought. A funny meme regardless, even if one doesn\u2019t agree with it exactly. All things considered, it seems this particular uptrend will surprise a lot of people. No one really expected any sort of bullish momentum to materialize prior to the weekend, let alone continue throughout Saturday. So far, things continue to look promising for Bitcoin and all other alternative markets, but the weekends will usually result in a bit of bearish pressure. At the same time, the overall crypto trading volume is relatively high for a weekend, which may be a sign of things to come. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

As far as the VeChain price is concerned, there is a lot of excitement for a lot of obvious reasons. As the price surpasses $0.0053 again, it seems traders expect a further uptrend over the next few hours. In the world of cryptocurrency, there is never a shortage of positive momentum or excitement. While that excitement isn\u2019t always warranted, it appears things are slowly coming together for VeChain in terms of partnerships and ecosystem growth. This results in a logical price increase, although it is a bit unclear if it can be sustained for an extended period of time. With a 3.35% increase in USD value and a 2.3% gain over Bitcoin, it seems things are looking promising for the VeChain price. This uptrend pushes the value to $0.00538, or 136 Satoshi. It is difficult to determine how high this price can go in the coming days, as that will primarily hinge on how Bitcoin is performing. The big news of the week is how VeChain has secured another major partnership. To most people, the company Haier will be well-known, although it is somewhat of a mystery to some. It seems Haier plans to integrate VeChain into its own Cosmoplat solution, which should provide a lot of exposure for the project. It may not impact the VET valuation in the slightest, though. This new partnership is the latest in a growing list for VeChain. While these partnerships, agreements, and deals are significant in their own right, they will not necessarily generate an increase in VET use. It is evident this news will certainly get a lot of people talking about VeChain, but that is only to be expected at this time. There is another development which has seemingly been ignored by most people. Although its impact remains to be determined at this time, it seems VeChain will be represented during a debate on private vs public blockchains. Such major exposure for this blockchain project can be crucial for future growth, although it remains to be seen if anything comes of it. With everything slowly coming together for VeChain, the weekend should offer interesting trading momentum. However, the overall trading volume is rather lackluster, which could indicate this latest uptrend is rather short lived once again.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/bet-with-blockchain-1xbit-sports-betting/", "author": "Guest", "title": "Bet with Blockchain: 1xBit Sports Betting", "content": "Sports betting is no longer a sector reserved to sports fans, and cryptocurrencies are not only for nerds. The collision of these two worlds comes in the form of 1xBit, an online betting platform which supports the use of cryptocurrencies. 1xBit has built itself a reputation since its launch in 2011, becoming one of the leading brands from the crypto betting scene. The platform incorporates a broad array of sports and events on which its users can place their wager. Everything from American Football, Basketball, and Football, to eSports, and Martial Arts is available. Each day new events are added to the list so that bettors have access to the most exciting fights and matches. In order to offer an enhanced betting environment, the platform accepts more than 20 cryptocurrencies as payment, among which we mention Bitcoin, Litecoin, Zcash, and Ethereum. 1xBit Just Added a New Section on Its Website The website features a number of sections which permit users to perform several bets, such as betting on their national team, a tournament, and many more. 1xBit brought forth a new section, UFC, which enables users to bet and review information, such as handicap, odds, and other stats for mixed martial arts fighters. UFC is the leading promoter of mixed martial arts, which brings only the best fighters and has the most viewed matches. Each year brings other several hundreds of UFC matches and, fortunately for sports fans, 1xBit created a special section which allows them to place bets on the outcome of UFC matches. Blockchain: Can It Help Online Betting? To create estimates of profits and odds, bookies apply analytics and probability on a spectrum of statistics and expert predictions to evaluate the outcome of an event. By adding their own profit margins to this probability, they produce the final odds. These odds are then used to multiply the value of the bets made on the platform, which generates the possible proceeds. It is known that bookmakers make their earnings and pay out to winning users with the money resulted from the losing bets. If you have more losing bettors, you have more profit, right? This logic can drive greedy bookies to produce slightly altered odds, promotions, and stats to manipulate in their favor the way a user bets. But with bookies based on distributed ledger technology, there are fewer concerns regarding the security and fairness of sportsbooks and their practices. By recording all transactions made on a blockchain, this makes all the stored data immutable, transparent, and accessible to anyone. 1xBit is a cryptocurrency-only bookie which offers a secure and transparent medium convenient to all its bettors. Traditional bookies do not leave much room for privacy when registering for an account. To create an account, you usually have to submit sensitive personal data which then goes through a lengthy verification process. 1xBit, on the contrary, provides anonymity and privacy through its quick One-Click account signup, which generates a password and personal account number with one single click of a mouse. After this process, the two-factor authentication feature can be activated to bring more protection to the account. Liquidity rates is another important aspect that can be positively influenced by the use of blockchain. Non-blockchain sports bookies charge fees for every withdrawal made, which is rather discouraging for frequent bettors who are looking to cash out right away. 1xBit allows users to make deposits and withdrawals without having to worry about fees. The only payment option accepted by 1xBit is in the form of cryptocurrencies, and due to this implementation, transactions are executed faster and without additional fees since the financial processing doesn\u2019t have a middleman. Cryptos Active in the Sports Scene More and more cryptos and blockchain projects are slowly making their entrance into the sports industry through various advertising tactics. Sponsorships and endorsements by and for crypto projects have started popping up in various corners of this industry. A recent example would constitute Litecoin and the deal it made with GLORY Kickboxing, a world-renowned kickboxing league. Through this partnership, fans can buy merchandise from the official website of GLORY by using LTC. A blog entry made by 1xBit illustrated another instance in which blockchain and sports intertwined. Stratis is a blockchain focused on dApp development which sponsored boxer James DeGale in the match for the World Super-Middleweight title. There are many more examples that can be listed, but we will limit ourselves only to these cases. The possibilities and use cases of blockchain are what piqued the interest of several betting platforms, such as 1xBit, to make the transition to crypto payments and benefit from adopting this technology.", "date": "2019-03-14T17:04:12+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 14}

Most of the bearish pressure has been averted, yet the current gains are fragile in nature. One notable exception comes in the form of the Qtum price, which is seemingly surging. Its overall trading volume of over $1.9bn makes zero sense to most traders, though, which could prove to be interesting to keep an eye on. In the cryptocurrency world, it is not uncommon to see altcoins go through a hearty pump-and-dump cycle. Some traders refer to these trends as \u201caltcoin season\u201d, although most users know better than that. In the case of Qtum, it seems there is a plain pump going on right now, primarily made possible thanks to a ludicrous amount of trading volume. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a 16% Qtum price increase. This trend is visible across both the USD and BTC markets, which paints a rather interesting picture. Because of this most recent and unexpected gain, one QTUM is now valued at $2.71, or 69,048 Satoshi. A very intriguing trend, especially at this time in history. Sustaining it will be rather complicated. On social media, there isn\u2019t anything spectacular to talk about when it comes to Qtum. A new potential partnership with Zeux could lead to some interesting mobile payment development. However, it is also worth noting Qtum is available for trading on OnePageX, a crypto exchange very few people seem to be using today. It may note a slightly higher trading volume today, assuming this pump will continue for a little while longer. The main concern right now is the overall Qtum trading volume, which makes no sense. Over $1.9bn in volume for a market cap of $250m is virtually impossible without fake volume or wash trading. In the case of Qtum, the volume mainly stems forth from LBank\u2019s BTC market, which seems to confirm the wash trading angle could certainly be in play. Regardless of why the price is going up, some traders are making good money because of this pump. Theomega is one of those people who noted a 30% increase in holdings. It is unclear if this user prefers to convert to USDT or Bitcoin, albeit it doesn\u2019t really matter in the end. Such strong gains will be cashed out for profits pretty quickly, as holding the bag would be counterproductive. All things considered, it would appear this Qtum pump will run out of steam at some point. A violent retrace is not out of the question, as a drop below $.25 would return the price to a more normal and manageable level. When that will happen exactly, remains to be determined. Anything is possible under these circumstances, but for now, the pressure is building slowly. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/what-is-altcoin-season-and-why-does-it-matter/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "What is Altcoin Season and Why Does it Matter?", "content": "There are numerous trends in the world of cryptocurrency. While it is evident nearly all of the major currencies rely on Bitcoin\u2019s value first and foremost, there is also a period when that unwritten rule is thrown out of the window. Traders often refer to such a trend as \u201cAltcoin Season\u201d, even though most people will agree such a thing does not necessarily exist. There is a very fine line between what is perceived as \u201cAltcoin Season\u201d and \u201cpump-and-dumps\u201d. It is safe to say no altcoin will gain value when Bitcoin is either bearish or extremely bullish. Although that situation can change over time, a bearish Bitcoin market will usually drag all alternative markets down with it. When the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency gains 5% in value or more, it takes a while for alternative markets to catch up. This is primarily because those currencies are losing value against Bitcoin directly. When this situation suddenly turns around, a conundrum known as \u201cAltcoin Season\u201d is created. It is the time of year when flavor-of-the-week altcoins suddenly start to gain a lot of value regardless of how Bitcoin\u2019s price is evolving. It is not entirely uncommon for alternative markets to gain a lot of value out of the blue, although such trends are usually referred to as \u201cpump-and-dump schemes\u201d first and foremost. Unlike what the name would suggest, the \u201cAltcoin Season\u201d is not necessarily something which happens during a specific time of year. In fact, there is no such \u201cAltcoin Season\u201d every year either, as the year 2018 made that rather apparent. However, it is a period during which cryptocurrency traders tend to get overly excited about smaller-cap coins gaining value so they can increase their Bitcoin holdings in the long run. No one will be surprised to learn the so-called Bitcoin Maximalists are not too keen on the \u201cAltcoin Season\u201d trend either. This is primarily because those users believe Bitcoin is the only currency which really matters, but also because it takes away trading volume and overall money from Bitcoin. There is nothing wrong with traders looking to increase their BTC holdings through these smaller-cap altcoins. However, that doesn\u2019t warrant the use of the term \u201cAltcoin Season\u201d by any means either. Until proven otherwise, it is nearly impossible to distinguish between the \u201cAltcoin Season\u201d and pump-and-dump schemes. Since most of the currencies gaining value during this \u201cseason\u201d are currencies which usually serve no purpose, have no real use case, or no clear future, it is only normal they will be referred to as \u201cshitcoins\u201d. As such, one has to adjust the expectations of what an \u201cAltcoin Season\u201d is and isn\u2019t. While it is promising to see some markets move up during these rather bearish times, the term \u201cAltcoin Season\u201d can be incredibly misleading. Considering how most of these markets will effectively drop in value again fairly quickly, it seems wrong to think of these minor uptrends as an extended run. However, there is nothing wrong with trying to make money by any means necessary.

While that is somewhat annoying, it is also completely to be expected. Even the Dogecoin price is feeling a bit of pressure, yet it seems to maintain its current value without too many problems. Traders will be pleased to hear the 52 Satoshi level is still in play. When the top crypto markets begin showing signs of weakness once again, it is a matter of time until bearish momentum materializes. With Bitcoin on the verge of dipping in the red, the coming hours will prove to be very crucial. For Dogecoin, there is nothing to worry about just yet, as everything remains in the green. That is somewhat surprising, although also a promising sign for all other markets. Over the past few hours, most of the positive cryptocurrency momentum has evaporated completely. This is visible where the Dogecoin price is concerned as well. A 0.4% gain in USD value and a 0.55% improvement over Bitcoin are not spectacular by any means. It is still far better than losing value like some other markets valued at a similar market cap. With the price still at $0.002030, things are looking rather positive. On social media, it would appear the overall DOGE sentiment isn\u2019t exactly bullish either. While some resistance has been broken earlier this week, there is no real continuation of the uptrend. This is primarily because of Bitcoin\u2019s sideways and bearish trend, but also because a lot of effort has been put into reclaiming the 52 Satoshi level. Keeping the price above $0.002 is also an ongoing struggle at this time. Luckily, it seems most Dogecoin users are well aware of why DOGE is so successful, In terms of using it for any kind of transaction, it seems there is no equal to this altcoin at this time. Its low fees and quick processing time make it vastly superior to Bitcoin and most other altcoins on the market today. It is also one of the strengths of this particular currency which is overlooked quite often. Last but not least, there is still a growing demand to see Dogecoin listed on the Binance trading platform. Despite ongoing inquiries from the DOGE community, it seems Binance couldn\u2019t care less about Dogecoin, for some unknown reason. Adding this currency would certainly result in a fair bit of liquidity, which benefits any cryptocurrency trading platform. All things considered, it seems Dogecoin will be able to maintain the current price levels without any real problems. The $0.002 level appears solid, as does the 52 Satoshi support. However, if Bitcoin were to turn mega bearish, Dogecoin will not be able to escape the negative trend unscathed either. A few interesting hours and days are ahead in this regard.

Although most markets remain in the green, there is a significant drop in XRP\u2019s price as of right now. The actual drop is not necessarily that steep, but it is evident things may come under further pressure moving forward. Considering how most markets were under a bit of bearish pressure earlier this morning, it is not too surprising to see minor losses materialize. In the case of XRP, the current trend is slightly disconcerting, although it seems the losses will be kept to a minimum. One worrisome aspect is how the price dropped below 8,000 Satoshi again, although reclaiming that value will not pose any major challenges. Over the past 24 hours, the net balance for XRP is slightly negative. With a 0.8% drop in USD value and a 1.1% loss over Bitcoin, the XRP price now sits at $0.3126. With a drop below 8,000 Satoshi, a fair few traders will not be too happy with the way things have gone. However, this appears to be a temporary setback first and foremost. There is no real major news regarding Ripple or XRP to speak of. One interesting video has surfaced which seems to indicate RIpple\u2019s trading engine is used for a particular marketplace. While that could be a bullish sign, it has absolutely nothing to do with the valuation of XRP at this time. As such, this news will \u2013 most likely \u2013 not have any impact on the price of this asset whatsoever. ShillWave, on the other hand, is seemingly too convinced there is anything to worry about in the slightest. In fact, this user keeps accumulating XRP regardless of the overall circumstances. Cost-averaging down one\u2019s investment is always a smart idea, especially while the bear market is still in effect. For those who are merely interested in the price chart, it seems this sideways and slightly bearish action may remain in place for some time to come. It is evident the range is tightening, and no bullish momentum has formed for XRP so far. As such, it seems logical to assume this is the beginning of another bear trend which may spill over into the weekend. For the time being, it seems likely more top markets will follow XRP\u2019s momentum over the coming hours. That is not entirely abnormal, although it is not the sign most traders are looking for. XRP is also the first top market to \u201cbuckle\u201d, which is never a fun label to deal with. It may also be the first to rebound sharply over the next few days, for all one knows.

So far, most of the damage remains contained where the top markets are concerned, although this may only be a temporary scenario. Surprisingly, this seems to make the Stellar price turn even more bullish all of a sudden. Very interesting market momentum to keep an eye on, assuming it can be sustained. While some people expect Stellar to follow Bitcoin\u2019s price momentum first and foremost, it seems rather unlikely that will be the case throughout today. For a lot of traders, this will be a welcome turn of events, whereas others will try to disrupt the market momentum in its entirety. Bucking this uptrend may prove rather challenging for many different reasons, though. Over the past 24 hours, the Stellar price has gained 7.6% across the board. Because of this ongoing price increase, one XLM is now valued at $0.1117, or 2,863 Satoshi. Very promising value shifts all over the place, although it remains to be seen how long it can be sustained. The overall trading volume seems to have suffered from a dip as well. Just $170.4m worth of trades have been executed, which might not be sufficient to keep things alive for very long. The big news of the week is how Stellar has made its way to the Coinbase Pro platform. Although this move was expected to occur sooner or later, it comes at a rather interesting time. Not that long ago, XRP made its way to this trading platform as well. Its price took a bit of a nosedive following that development, yet it seems the XLM price is picking up steam in the process. How this new listing will pan out for XLN, remains to be determined. On social media, it seems there is some cautious excitement and confusion regarding Stellar\u2019s price trend. Arkane expected the XLM value to plummet just like all other top markets, but it is evident that is not the case whatsoever. It isn\u2019t necessarily \u201cpumping\u201d either by any means, as this uptrend has been in place for quite some time now. By the look of things, that may remain the case for a while longer. For those who are not too interested in holding XLM for the long term, arbitrage opportunities are always worth exploring. In the case of Stellar Lumens, it would appear things are looking quite good. Several arbitrage opportunities can be explored for a potential profit of up to 2.3%. That is, assuming one is comfortable using either CEX or EXMO to cash out the profits in the end. These rather unexpected market conditions seem to favor Stellar\u2019s uptrend at this time. As other markets begin to crumble under the pressure, Stellar continues to do its own thing without any real problems or setbacks. As such, the $0.11 level could be turned into solid support over the coming hours, but it is still too early to draw any real conclusions on that front. If the trading volume picks up a bit, things could get very interesting for this particular asset. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Although nearly all markets are linked to Bitcoin in one way or another, one also has to acknowledge individual developments can spark price excitement. As far as the Electroneum price is concerned, it would appear there is plenty of excitement to go around. Key developments and a new exchange listing pave the way for a bullish period. After what can only be described as a bit of a rough weekend, the start of this week wasn\u2019t too promising for Electroneum. Although there was no real reason for bearish pressure, most of the markets went through an uncertain trend for a little while. It now seems all of those doubts are out of the way, as multiple markets resume their bullish momentum without too much effort. Electroneum is one of those currencies, which further confirms it is in a rather good place right now. To put this in perspective, the Electroneum price has risen by 12% in USD value and 11.6% in BTC value. Because of this somewhat unexpected big uptrend, the Electroneum value has risen to $0.006478, or 166 Satoshi again. This is a vast improvement compared to the 143 Satoshi level a few days ago. Plenty of traders got worried at that time, for rather understandable reasons. Its trading volume remains relatively low, but that situation may change fairly soon. As confirmed by the Huobi Global exchange, it would appear ETN is making its way to this platform later today. Deposits will be opened first, and both ETN/BTC and ETN/ETH trading markets will go live the next day. Electroneum withdrawals will not be accessible until the 15th, which is how these listings usually go. The community expects this listing to introduce a lot more trading liquidity, although that is much easier said and done. There is also a new development update provided by the Electroneum team. Over the past few days, there was some concern as to whether or not new developments were ongoing. It seems those concerns were unjustified, as the project is still moving forward. As is usually the case when updates are shared, some people couldn\u2019t care less about actual developments and just want more exchange listings. With Huobi Global now checking that box, a few interesting days may lie ahead. There is also an interesting observation by 47 Bullion to take note of. Over the past few years, mobile \u201cclick farms\u201d have become a lot more common. This Twitter ponders if turning those devices into Electroneum cloud miners through the iOS and Android apps would be an option worth exploring. After all, it is a good way to generate a passive income, even though no one will get rich from doing so anytime soon. The main question is whether or not Huobi Global can offer ETN the trading volume it so direly needs. While getting listed on such a platform is a big development, if the market doesn\u2019t deliver, it can be removed rather swiftly as well. Speculators who wanted a big exchange\u2019s support should be pleased with this development. Once the excitement calms down, however, the ETN price could be in for a rather rough ride.

Even though it is not the most exciting market to keep an eye on, it usually serves as an overall industry trend indicator. With the Dogecoin price now on the rise and successfully surpassing $0,002 again, it seems the rest of the week will yield interesting market momentum. It has been coming for quite some time now, but the value of Dogecoin has finally overcome a key resistance level. Although OGE is far from the only cryptocurrency to note real gains today, it seems there are a lot of people out there who keep a close eye on this particular market. Especially holders who want to increase their BTC holdings will pay close attention to the meme currency of the internet. To put everything in its proper perspective, the Dogecoin has surpassed the $0.002 level again. This is made possible following a 2.85% increase in both USD and BTC value alike. In terms of DOGE/BTC, the 50 Satoshi acted as solid support through a worrisome weekend. Today, one DOGE is valued at 52 Satoshi again, although not much further progress is to be expected at this time. On social media, it seems the usual Dogecoin-related discussions are taking place. Mj confirms there is a lot of value being transferred on the network in the past few hours. In fact, Dogecoin transits more value per hour than some other top currencies do in an entire day. That alone tells something, even though it doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect on the price in either positive or negative fashion. Many people expect Dogecoin to go tot he moon some day. Jan Hvizdak, on the other hand, expects the moon to come to Dogecoin. It is a very different semantic, although the end result could very well be the exact same. When this is expected to occur, is anyone\u2019s guess. There is still a long way to go until any currency, token, or asset comes near \u201cmoon levels\u201d again. When looking at the current DOGE/BTC price chart, it is evident a tug-of-war is going on. While the 50 Satoshi support level has been under a lot of pressure, it now seems the 51 Satoshi level will take its place. As such, it is up to traders to nibble away at 52 Satoshi if they want this run to continue. It will be difficult to do so, though, but one never knows what the future may hold. For the time being, Dogecoin holders would do well to enjoy this semi-bullish run while it lasts. The cryptocurrency industry has seen numerous setbacks after some promising momentum, and this run may end up the exact same. However, if Bitcoin were to remain in the green as well, anything can happen. It will be interesting to see how long the value can remain above $0.002 this time around.

While there is still a long way to go, far less red on the charts is always a good thing. The Litecoin price is trying to move up again after a minor struggle. The push to $60 is still in effect as of right now. It is good to see nearly all of the top markets in the green again after what appeared to be a new wave of bearish pressure forming. Litecoin is suddenly turning on the pumps again, as its one-week trend was bullish well before today. However, it seemed that market would turn bearish for a while as well. With that crisis now off the table, it will be interesting to see if $60 becomes a viable price target over the coming weeks. As far as the Litecoin price is concerned, it would appear things are getting rather interesting. With a 3.15% gain in USD value and a 2.68% gain over Bitcoin, no one can deny things look promising right now. As the Litecoin value surpasses $57 again without too many problems, there is some cautious optimism to be noted. Combined with a healthy trading volume, this week may turn out to be a rather good one. On social media, there is no shortage of Litecoin discussions as of right now. It seems the recent post regarding the Litecoin Core 0.17.1 release candidate sparks some excitement. Further developing any cryptocurrency is always necessary. Standing still in the cryptocurrency world will always result in a massive price decline. While Litecoin might not be the most innovative altcoin on the market, it certainly shows some signs of life when the time is nigh. There is also a very peculiar poll on the internet which would see the creation of Litecoin Bank. More specifically, WEG Bank is intent on changing its name to Litecoin Bank if their Twitter poll gets enough support. As is to be expected, a portion of the community does not like this idea whatsoever, as associating cryptocurrency with a bank is asking for trouble. For those who are mainly intent on checking out the price chart, it would appear there is room for further growth at some point. A return to a price of $300 or more will not happen in the near future whatsoever, but it is always important to keep one\u2019s options on the table these days. Slow and steady will certainly yield favorable results compared to quick pumps. Based on the current market circumstances, it would seem Litecoin is clearly in a good place. The big question is whether or not this is a permanent uptrend or just another blip on the radar. Assuming it is the latter, things could return to normal pretty quickly at this rate. A push to $60 would spark plenty of excitement, for rather obvious reasons, yet it remains to be seen what will happen to Bitcoin first and foremost.

While this is not a confirmation of a sustainable uptrend, one has to acknowledge the current XRP price momentum looks somewhat intriguing. Although the price remains at a near status quo, the push to 8,000 Satoshi is still ongoing. As long as Bitcoin remains in the green \u2013 however slightly \u2013 good things will probably come to the alternative markets. It is evident XRP is no exception in this regard, although it seems there is something brewing at this time. Sustaining the $0.31 level will not be that big of a problem whatsoever, but it appears the XRP/BTC trend could see some big changes moving forward. To be more specific, there is a big development in place already. One XRP is valued at less than 8,000 Satoshi, with no real improvements in sight. The most recent 0.35% loss isn\u2019t helping matters much. Despite this trend, there is a 0.12% gain in USD value, which is almost neglectable. For some reason, XRP/BTC keeps offsetting most XRP/USD gains, even under the current circumstances. On social media, there is some unrest among XRP enthusiasts. While that is not entirely surprising by any means, it seems some traders want to see a market shift happen pretty soon. X-Ray Pete, for example, expects some sort of \u201cevent\u201d to usher in XRP\u2019s bull run. One has to wonder what can potentially trigger a major XRP price surge at this time, as none of the recent news seems to do the job. Neil J Duncan, on the other hand, expects something else entirely This user quoted a former Ripple employee as saying how XRP is the world\u2019s most liquid asset. While there is a case to be made there, it remains to be determined what will happen in the future exactly. Liquidity is crucial for any asset, yet it doesn\u2019t automatically correlate with its value or perceived value. Last but not least, it seems the XRP \u201chaters\u201d are slowly running out of mud to sling or arguments to use. As XRP NEO confirms, there are very few facts to be used against RIpple and XRP. While there are a lot of different opinions on both projects at this time, emotions tend to cloud many judgments. That doesn\u2019t mean XRP will be more or less successful than it is today in a few years time. With all of this information in the back of traders\u2019 minds, it seems unlikely any major price change will occur for XRP. The current status quo is rather easy to sustain, yet pushing through to the next level is anything but. As such, the ongoing losses in XRP/BTC may continue to disrupt any USD-based price changes for some time to come. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Although some bearish momentum began forming in the evening, it seems things have taken a turn for the better again. The Stellar price, which already showed signs of a promising bull run last week, is simply continuing its momentum. For now, the $0.1 level acts as solid support, which comes as somewhat of a surprise. It is quite interesting to see how all of these individual markets behave under the current market circumstances. While it is only normal to see most markets benefit from Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing trend, it would appear things are picking up steam where XLM is concerned. Its bull run last week is still not over, by the look of things, which comes as somewhat of a surprise. Not necessarily because people expected a downtrend, but primarily because reaching $0.1 was expected to trigger more backlash. Over the past 24 hours, the Stellar price has noted another 4.3% increase in USD value and gained 3.74% over Bitcoin. This new push brings the XLM value to $0.103951 or 2,661 Satoshi. It would appear these levels will need to act as further support, although it remains to be seen if that can effectively happen. The $148.5m in 24-hour trading volume is not exactly that impressive, but it is not necessarily the worst development either. On social media, it would appear there is a lot of excitement regarding XLM at this point. CryptoCurrency seems to be cheerleading from the sidelines, although some people will undoubtedly interpret this as shilling. While the current market momentum would certainly warrant holding XLM in search of further profits, one would think this run will not continue forever. In fact, there may be some sort of small correction at some point in the very near future. For those who are looking at the actual XLM chart, it would appear things are not looking all that bad either. There have been numerous waves up and down where this market is concerned, yet it seems a drop below $0.1 will not necessarily occur anytime soon. That is, unless the Bitcoin price were to drop well below the current level, which is always a possibility. The current circumstances seem to indicate the uneasy Bitcoin momentum could remain in place for a while. For those users who are interested in XLM arbitrage opportunities, it seems there are plenty of choices today. More specifically, there is a good profit to be pocketed from exploring XLM price differences between the exchanges below. One potential downside is how EXMO doesn\u2019t necessarily have the most liquidity to speak of, which could thwart any attempt at scoring the big money. All things considered, Stellar is going on quite a good run as of late. The positive momentum is still in place even today, yet there is a genuine chance this trend will sour later today. When that happens, the value should not drop below $0.1 in the process, although the 2,600 Satoshi level may come under a bit of pressure in the process. Maintaining the market cap rank 9 position should not pose any genuine problems either. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

The Cardano price, while not all talked about all that often, is going through a positive spell as of right now. That in itself is a surprising and remarkable development, especially because it appeared the top markets would remain bearish for quite some time to come. After a rough evening yesterday and uneasy momentum during the early morning hours, things have begun looking up for all cryptocurrencies. Cardano is one of the first top 15 coins to note a strong gain, although it seems to be a matter of time until the rest will follow suit. For the time being, it remains to be seen how long this current trend will remain in place. Over the past few hours, the Cardano price has gained 4.1% in USD value, bringing the value back to $0.047268. There\u2019s also a 5% gain over Bitcoin, pushing the price to 1,214 Satoshi, for the time being. Its overall trading volume is still on the low side of the spectrum, as $54m in volume is not all that spectacular. Considering ADA\u2019s market cap sits at $1.225bn, one would expect $125m in trading volume or more. On social media, it would appear as if there is an increase in Cardano these days. That is what the CardanoBuzz account claims, at least, although it seems there are no real major discussions pertaining to Cardano to take note of right now. The upcoming introduction of Shelley may change that situation in the near future, although it remains to be seen how all of this will impact the price, if at all. The bigger topic of debate is how Cardano is slowly moving toward a gradual decentralization of the network and core protocol. That in itself will lead to some interesting developments, although this \u201cphase\u201d will last for quite some time to come. Assuming the developers can get this transition right, the second half of 2019 may have some intriguing things in store for Cardano. For those who keep an eye on the actual ADA price chart, however, things are not necessarily looking bad nor good. The somewhat sudden Binance maintenance could have easily triggered a price drop, yet it seems the opposite is happening. That is rather unusual in this volatile industry, although it is a welcome sight. TheWolfofAllStreets expects there to be a further dip prior to breaking out to ADA hitting almost 1,700 Satoshi. An interesting train of thought, although it may not necessarily come true. For the time being, this sudden uptrend affecting top markets is a big surprise. Although it is not a bad thing by any means, it would appear there is some uncertainty regarding its potential longevity. There has been plenty of bearish momentum in crypto for quite some time now, and it seems not all of that pressure has subsided at this time. For Cardano, a push to $0.05 is possible, but not necessarily plausible. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

With most top markets noting a gain of 5% or less, it would appear VeChain is doing things very differently. So much even that the VeChain price currently notes a 16% gain across the board, although there is no real reason for such a sudden outbreak This also makes one wonder if the momentum can be sustained for more than a few hours. It is quite evident a lot of cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets have waited for a Bitcoin uptrend to materialize. As most of these markets directly derive value from the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency, it is only normal those markets turn bullish when Bitcoin does. VeChain is no exception in this regard, although it remains to be seen if the market isn\u2019t getting ahead of itself right now. After all, this steep growth should result in a retrace at some point. Over the past few hours, the VeChain price has risen by 16% across the board. This brings the US Dollar value back to $0.005271, whereas the BTC value hit 135 Satoshi once again. It is a very promising sign all across the board, although one has to keep in mind such steep and sudden growth can also be problematic. Combined with the relatively low trading volume, all of this excitement could peter out pretty quickly. On social media, there is still a lot of excitement and hype regarding the upcoming VeChain Summit of 2019. So far, no one really knows if any major announcement will be made. If there is one, it remains uncertain what it could possibly be about at this time. There is always the chance of not seeing any major announcements during this event, although that would certainly be quite disappointing to a lot of investors. There are also traders who are inclined to cash out the current profits, which is only normal. Following such a steep increase, not cashing out these profits would be a lot more worrisome. Ashish Thadani is trying to chase a potential XLM pump, although it remains to be seen if this is the last leg of VET\u2019s run. Keeping all of this information in mind, things will undoubtedly get interesting over the coming hours. The actual VET price chart doesn\u2019t look overly promising, although it is not all that bad either. With this most recent leg up in place, it would appear the double bottom will remain in effect for a little while longer. There is also the breakout of the triangle, which can be interpreted as a major bullish sign. Even so, these volatile markets are nearly impossible to predict under the best of circumstances. For the time being, traders would be wise to consider cashing out some profits before the momentum sours. If history has shown anything, it is how no uptrend will be supported for very long, especially in the cryptocurrency industry. As such, it will be interesting to see if VeChain can remain above $0.005 throughout the day. A push to $0.0055 isn\u2019t impossible either, but it might be a lot more complicated than traders would assume. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

With Bitcoin dragging everything else down with it in quick succession, the losses are piling up fairly quickly. For the Electroneum price, the current momentum is not necessarily all that great. A drop below $0.0055 seemingly looms ahead, which will not please most investors, for obvious reasons. Although a lot of traders and speculators had high hopes for Electroneum in the first quarter of 2019, it seems most of this excitement has evaporated once again. With the price in the dirt for nearly a week on end now, it seems unlikely any real market reversal needs to be expected. The trading volume for ETN is not moving up either, primarily because of the lack of major exchanges supporting it. To put everything in its proper perspective, the Electroneum price has lost 4.84% in USD value and 3.57% over Bitcoin. This development brings the ETN price down to $0.005532, or 142 Satoshi. Neither of these trends will get a lot of people excited, which is only to be expected at this time. Although there is some support at the $0.0055 level, it remains to be seen how long it can remain in place under these circumstances. On social media, there is a lot of unrest among the Electroneum community, by the look of things. Ziegler Toby is worried about the lack of project updates since Mobile World Congress 2019. While several key announcements were made at that particular time, it seems that isn\u2019t sufficient to keep holders engaged for the long run. That is only to be expected, although there is no market panic to speak of whatsoever. The Scrooge XPRess, on the other hand, would love to see some more fiat onramps for Electroneum in the coming months. The lack of support for fiat currencies in most countries can hold down the growth of any cryptocurrency project. The role of importance of South Africa for Electroneum remains to be determined, but the lack of a fiat onramp in this country can prove to be quite challenging. Last but not least, a lot of people were smitten by the Electroneum mobile cloud mining application. However, it seems some users are not getting their payouts in a swift manner. Nathan Joyce claims his payout has been delayed by a week, which would certainly be problematic if that is more than an individual issue. There has never been an official timeline as to when these payouts would be processed, although one would expect them to be completed fairly quickly. All signs seem to indicate the bearish ETN price trend will continue for quite some time to come. Bitcoin\u2019s trend isn\u2019t helping matters. The unrest on social media can trigger a further sell-off in the coming days, although the overall trading volume hasn\u2019t changed all that much. A drop below $0.0055 seems all but inevitable at this time, although one never knows how things will play out.", "date": "2019-03-11T15:25:13+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 11}

So far, that appears to be the case, as eight out of ten top markets are in the red right now. Even the XRP price is facing a bit of bearish pressure. It remains to be seen if the $0.31 level can be maintained for much longer, as the current trend doesn\u2019t look all that promising. No one will be surprised to see the bearish Bitcoin pressure get to alternative markets in recent hours. Most of these markets derive value from Bitcoin first and foremost, although there will always be some exceptions in this regard. As far as XRP is concerned, it would benefit from a Bitcoin uptrend, even though that could easily disrupt the XRP/BTC ratio. That ratio has, for the first time in a while, dropped below 8,000 Satoshi and is staying there. Over the past 24 hours, the net 0.46% loss in USD value is not overly important. It does push the XRP price very close to the $0.31 level, although the level may hold for a little while longer. There is also a 0.6% gain in XRP/BTC, yet reclaiming the 8,000 Satoshi level will prove to be incredibly challenging first and foremost. The overall trading volume for XRP looks somewhat promising, although it may not be sufficient. On social media, there has never been a shortage of discussions pertaining to Ripple and XRP. Investment Perspectives, for example, claims Ripple is doing exactly what the company has advertised in the past few months. However, a positive development for Ripple doesn\u2019t necessarily result in promising XRP value momentum either. Ripple and XRP are entwined in some ways, yet completely different things for the most part. When looking at the current price chart, the momentum does not look too promising. MooniaK expects the range to bounce between $0.3 and $0.31 for the next few hours, although the bearish pressure will probably get the better of this market in the end. That is not a promising outlook by any means, although it is also possible this scenario will play out in a completely different manner over the coming hours and days. For those who want to explore potential profits without holding on to XRP for too long, a triangular arbitrage has popped up today. Although using BitBns will be problematic for some enthusiasts, there is a lot of good money to be made with this particular trade. A potential gain of over 41% is always enticing, albeit the different hoops one has to jump through can make it seem less appealing. When looking at the bigger picture, it seems unlikely any market will recover until Bitcoin gets its act together once again. When that will happen exactly, is anyone\u2019s guess at this point. For XRP, the $0.31 level will remain under a fair bit of pressure for the foreseeable future. Dropping below this threshold is not catastrophic, yet it can make a lot of people antsy.

While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are clearly setting the bar for everyone else, it is also quite evident Dogecoin is here to stay. Unlike most other altcoins, DOGE has a special place in people\u2019s hearts, although the price doesn\u2019t always reflect it. Even today, the $0.002 level still hasn\u2019t been broken in a positive manner, which puts a lot of strain on the Dogecoin price and its investors. For those people who had expected bullish DOGE momentum over the weekend, there was plenty of disappointment. None of the top markets \u2013 with the exception of Stellar \u2013 noted any real gains in the past 48-60 hours. That is rather unfortunate, although it was also somewhat to be expected. Until Bitcoin finds stable ground, all other markets will remain under a lot of pressure as well. Dogecoin will not be an exception in this regard. To put this in perspective, the current market momentum doesn\u2019t look too promising. The Dogecoin price lost another 1.43% in USD value and 1.25% in Bitcoin value. Luckily, the 50 Satoshi level is holding its own right now, but that situation may come to change in the very near future. In terms of USD value, one DOGE is priced at $0.00196, which means the $0.002 level is still a long way away at this time. On social media, there are a few interesting tidbits of Dogecoin-related information to take note of. First of all, a new Dota 2 merchandise site is looking to experiment with Dogecoin payments. Although it is evident this particular platform will not necessarily gain a lot of traction right away, it is still a rather promising development overall. More sites dealing with Dogecoin payments is a sign of ecosystem growth. A rather interesting post has shown up on the Dogecoin Reddit this weekend. More specifically, it seems some users are wondering where the community has gone and what will happen next for this particular altcoin. There is a bit of cynicism to contend with in this regard, as the \u201cincreasing interest in shitcoins\u201d is considered to be the main reason for this lack of community engagement. Although Dogecoin has seen its fair share of unique and interesting memes over the years, some images tend to stick better in people\u2019s minds than others. The meme below is perhaps one of the more iconic ones to ever be created. It can also mean a fair few different things, depending on how one wants to look at it. Some see Dogecoin as a waste of money, whereas others consider it to be the greatest altcoin ever created. Although there is no real positive Dogecoin momentum as of right now, it seems unlikely this altcoin will start bleeding value all over the place anytime soon. While Dogecoin usually relies less on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum, the altcoin would certainly benefit from a positive development affecting that market. Even so, the 50 Satoshi level is still under plenty of pressure at this time, which doesn\u2019t bode well for the near future. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

In today\u2019s edition, it would appear there is a sudden and surprising interest in Groestlcoin. So much even that the price has more than doubled in value over the past few hours. That is primarily because of a heavily inflated trading volume, which seems to make little sense at this time. While every cryptocurrency, token, or digital asset is an individual project first and foremost, it is always a bit unclear how things will evolve in the price department. In the case of Groestlcoin, there is a loyal community which supported this project in recent years. Even so, the GRS price never showed any real potential for more than a few hours on end. This run may turn out to be more of the same, even though its magnitude is quite bullish all across the board. In the past 24 hours, the Groestlcoin price has risen by 142% in both USD and BTC value alike. That is rather interesting to take note of, as this altcoin has not noted such steep gains for quite some time. Because of this unexpected price rush, the value per GRS has risen to $0.5786, or nearly 15,000 Satoshi. Long-term holders will be pleased with these gains in Bitcoin value first and foremost, as that is what most altcoin traders are after these days. The big news this week is how Groestlcoin may finally become more useful in the real world. A new partnership with PolisPay allows the altcoin to be used as a funding method for a Mastercard-themed debit card. While this development is more than interesting, all things considered, one also has to wonder how many people will make use of this functionality. For those who expect this to be the beginning of a major \u201cnews wave\u201d for Groestlcoin, the situation may not work out all that well. More specifically SanctiGrial expects this to be the debit card news to become irrelevant first and foremost, with no long-term sustainability behind it. While that may be true, it remains to be seen if this is just a pump cycle after which things return back to normal. When looking at the actual GRS/BTC price chart on Binance, it is evident things are not looking too great. The quick succession of green candles has already triggered a minor collapse, although it seems the GRS price is rebounding swiftly. Such ups-and-downs will continue to occur for quite some time to come, as the gains of over 100% are hardly ever sustainable for the long run. It will mainly depend on whether this $490m in trading volume remains in place, yet that seems unlikely. It is rather interesting to see such a bullish market emerge when most of the top markets are pretty bearish. Although Groestlcoin is a very different creature at this time, it appears to be a matter of time until things will return to normal for this altcoin. At the same time, it may be a sign of what is yet to come for all other crypto markets over the coming hours and days. Some bullish industry-wide momentum would be more than welcome at this time.

Although not all markets are even close to turning bullish, the weekend will undoubtedly yield some promising momentum. Until then, however, the Binance Coin price will seemingly remain under a lot of pressure. All of the \u201cadvocating\u201d on Twitter is seemingly backfiring on this project a bit. It is not entirely surprising to see the value of Binance Coin drop off a bit after a very strong bull run earlier this week. Those massive gains would never be sustainable for the long run. Such a strong uptrend will always be met with a correction, which is exactly what BNB is going through at this time. While it remains a bit unclear how long the negative pressure will remain in place, it seems this may not be the current bottom by any means. Over the past 24 hours, the Binance Coin price lost 5% in USD value, 5.4% over Bitcoin, and 4.5% over Ethereum. It is a sea of red all across the board, which was entirely to be expected. Because of this downtrend, the value per BNB has dropped to $14,42 or 0.00367902 BTC. Not necessarily a big problem at this time, although the overall trend is not positive either. While the trading volume remains strong, it seems unlikely any major uptrend will occur in the coming hours. On social media, the hype and excitement regarding BNB is seemingly spiraling out of control. More specifically, there are now people who genuinely believe Binance Coin\u2019s market cap will surpass that of XRP. Although not entirely impossible by any means, it is also rather improbable. It will be interesting to see how things evolve in this regard, as there is over $10bn separating both markets right now. M.m is another individual who can seemingly only see stars and the moon when it comes to Binance Coin. While there is nothing wrong with being smitten by a project, a price surge to $20 in the next 11 days seems rather peculiar. Again, this is an entirely probable scenario given the recent BNB price trend, although it will primarily depend on what happens to Bitcoin first and foremost. Del Rypto, on the other hand, expected BNB to hit 0.004 Bitcoin just a few hours ago. Unfortunately for him and other traders, this never materialized in the end. Three rejections in a row only confirm this uptrend was not sustainable by any stretch of the imagination. While Del Rypto still noted a 140% profit in the process, it remains to be seen when the next attempt to break 0.004 will occur. As is always the case just ahead of a weekend, there may be some unexpected momentum over the next 72 hours. Whether or not that will bring hope to Binance Coin holders and speculators, is difficult to predict at this time. With these rather steep losses already in place, it seems there may be a lot more negative momentum later today. Crypto investors tend to panic whenever the momentum sours these days.

Although there will always be some minor expectations in this regard, it is pretty evident there will be some hurdles to overcome. As of right now, the EOS price faces the most pressure in the top 5. Its losses are not worrisome in the slightest, yet things are not looking too great either. While the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is not necessarily losing all that much value, it is evident there is plenty of bearish pressure to keep an eye on. Especially where the other top 5 markets are concerned, the losses are stacking up pretty quickly already. EOS is a good example, as it has lost the most value of the entire top 5 at this time. That loss needs to be nuanced a bit, as the actual decline is not all that steep. Over the past 24 hours, it becomes apparent the EOS price has decreased by 2.1% in USD value. This negative momentum drives the price down to $3.64, which is not necessarily all that worrisome. In terms of EOS/BTC, things are not looking too great following a 1.78% drop. The 92,700 Satoshi level will seemingly hold true for at least another day, even though it wouldn\u2019t take much additional pressure to shatter that support level. On social media, there is never a shortage of excitement or developments affecting individual cryptocurrency projects. Whale Alert is an interesting account on Twitter to keep an eye on, although its recent message sparks some confusion. The account claims 1 trillion EOS was transferred from an unknown wallet to another unknown wallet. Since this transaction doesn\u2019t exist \u2013 and blatantly surpasses the total supply of EOS by factor 100 \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t cause any real panic whatsoever. In slightly more tangible news, there is a chance an interesting collaboration between EOS and Wanchain might be on the horizon. More specifically, the WanChain team confirms a new chain bridge will be announced shortly, although no one knows for sure which project will be tapped in the process. EOS is a potential candidate, although there are plenty of other options to take into account as well. As has been the case for quite some time now, there will always be arbitrage opportunities to take advantage of. In the case of EOS, there are a few interesting price gaps between some of the bigger exchanges. This will allow for potential profits of up to 1.58%, which is not a bad thing by any means. Even if the EOS value were to turn more bullish or bearish, these gaps will most likely remain in place for some time to come. All of the current market signs indicate EOS will not necessarily recover any lost value until Bitcoin goes in the green again. That in itself is always a worrisome turn of events, although it remains to be seen how long the negative pressure can remain in place. Since no major losses are recorded across any of the top 5 markets right now, it would appear this momentum can turn around on a dime. That will be something to look forward to over the coming hours.

In the cryptocurrency world, that situation is no different, although things are done a bit differently. Monero, one of the more popular altcoins, has undergone another major fork, which makes the project further ASIC-resistant and privacy-oriented. The trade-off is how its network hashrate has dropped off significantly in the process. When it comes to upgrading the core protocol of any cryptocurrency, a hard fork is usually the best way to go. Bitcoin has seen its fair share of upgrades over the years, and Ethereum is going down a very similar path. Monero, the anonymity- and privacy-oriented altcoin, has seen many major upgrades over the past few years as well. Its most recent hard fork has been deemed a success, which is rather promising, all things considered. As is always the case, there is a good reason as to why such a protocol upgrade is introduced. The Monero developers have never been a big fan of ASIC mining hardware disrupting their network. As part of this most recent hard fork, the team decided to successfully thwart current and future ASIC mining altogether. It is a very serious decision, although one that not everyone will agree with automatically. Some cryptocurrency users see ASIC mining hardware as a valuable addition, rather than a threat. Anyone who has high hopes for using ASIC mining hardware for Monero will be sorely disappointed. A new algorithm has been introduced, known as CryptoNight-R. It is incompatible with all current ASIC mining code and will \u2013 most likely -thwart all future ASIC mining efforts at the same time. All miners will need to update their mining software as well to be compatible with the new algorithm. It is this shift which is the main culprit for Monero\u2019s network hashrate dropping off by nearly 80% in the past few days. For most cryptocurrency projects, a near 80% drop in hashrate would be quite catastrophic. It puts the project at severe risk, although it seems unlikely this situation will remain in place for Monero. The switch to new mining software will always have an impact and may take a week or more to be fully resolved. While some ASICs may have been mining XMR prior to the fork, their \u201cdisappearance\u201d should not cause too many problems at this time. The latest hard fork also introduces some other noteworthy changes. First of all, the dynamic block size algorithm has been revamped slightly. Blockchain bloating attacks will no longer be a factor, which is a positive development. A quality of life change like these will please a lot of XMR enthusiasts, as it is a change everyone will benefit from in the long run. Combined with the introduction of additional transaction privacy, this fork seemingly has a lot to offer for everyone. As is always the case when an important protocol change is introduced, the new Monero clients were available for download well in advance. Users who have not upgraded yet are advised to do so as quickly as possible to avoid any potential issues. All service providers involved in Monero are expected to complete the necessary upgrade pretty soon as well. In terms of the network hashrate, it will be interesting to see what comes next for this altcoin project. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

A lot of uneasy momentum has materialized in the past few hours, which usually doesn\u2019t bode well for the coming days. When even the Dogecoin price is turning a bit more bearish than it already was, there isn\u2019t much to get excited about right now. It is not necessarily all that common to see Dogecoin \u2013 of all currencies \u2013 show weakness during a time when one would expect the opposite. So far, the year 2019 has not been too easy for DOGE, even though there is no real reason for this particular development. With the price still not breaking through the $0.002 resistance, and the 50 Satoshi level coming under pressure, things simply do not look good. Over the past 24 hours, there has been another 0.7% decline in USD value and a 1.17% deficit over Bitcoin. Although the current price of $0.001985 will not worry too many people, the drop to 50 Satoshi isn\u2019t comforting in the slightest. Although this is a solid support level for the Dogecoin price, it too can fall if push comes to shove. That is not something speculators are looking forward to. On social media, there are always some interesting opinions regarding Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets. Mj, for example, isn\u2019t convinced Dogecoin should take a back seat to Nano, XRP, or ReddCoin at this stage. There is an argument to be made here, primarily because none of these markets are targeting the same users as of right now. In more positive news, it would appear the DogePal service will continue to push the appeal of Dogecoin in the right direction. It is a very interesting service which unlocks a lot of potential use cases, even though it is only designed for the Dogecoin ecosystem. Even so, the option to tip DOGE has been well received so far, especially because of the anonymity features users can explore. When looking at the actual Dogecoin chart, however, it remains to be seen what the future will hold exactly. As the new level of support is under a lot of pressure, a breakdown would be rather catastrophic for Dogecoin. As such, the coming few days will prove to be crucial in many different ways, although it remains to be seen how everything will play out. That will primarily depend on what happens to Bitcoin over the course of the weekend. With these fresh losses in place as of right now, it is a bit unclear how dire things will get for Dogecoin over the coming hours and days. Although the USD value should remain in place for the time being, the 50 Satoshi level will need to provide strong support. It has been a while since DOGE dropped below this particular threshold, yet it may happen again in the very near future. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Two days ago, the market seemed a bit bearish, whereas yesterday was slightly more positive. Today, it seems as if the bearish trend will return once again. Despite the odds, the Electroneum price is starting to move up ever so slightly. A promising development, at least for the short-term. When Bitcoin and other top markets show some signs of bearish pressure, virtually all other markets will follow suit in the near future. Today appears to be one of those days when things seemingly will not turn out all that well, although Electroneum may prove to be a minor exception. Although its overall momentum is far from impressive right now, there is some positivity affecting the market at this time. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a healthy 3% increase in the Electroneum price. This rise affects both the USD and BTC value alike, which shows there may be some life to this uptrend. More specifically, the current price sits at $0.006156, or 157 Satoshi. It would appear the 150 Satoshi has held after all, although there may still be some further pressure in the coming days. Weekends are usually rather disruptive for some currencies, especially the lower-cap ones. The excitement regarding ETN is always present on social media. It seems the Electroneum team still has a few leftover M1 phones from Mobile World Congress 2019. It is evident this device has a lot of people talking about Electroneum as of right now, although it is not necessarily something that will elevate the price all of a sudden. A tangible product is still pretty uncommon in the cryptocurrency world these days, thus ETN seems to be ahead of the curve. Akinsboy is simply happy to see how Electroneum\u2019s team is delivering on all promises and within the allotted timeline, for the most part. It is evident this project is checking a lot of the right boxes in this regard, even though its current value and market cap might tell a completely different tale. Developers sticking tot heir timeline is another rarity in the cryptocurrency world these days. Paul Tomlinson considers now to be a good time to buy more ETN. Although this user doesn\u2019t mind using the KuCoin exchange, having Electroneum on Binance would certainly be an interesting sight to behold. It would appear as if Binance has no imminent plans to add Electroneum, although one never knows what the future may hold. Currencies which perform well and are not subjected to much controversy usually seem to make their way to Binance sooner or later. All things considered, this upward Electroneum momentum was somewhat to be expected. Although the gains are not all that big at this time, it seems unlikely the weekend will disrupt this momentum as of right now. However, Electroneum\u2019s trading volume remains incredibly low, like it has been for several months now. Until that volume improves significantly, it seems unlikely a real breakout will occur in the near future. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Nearly all of the top 10 markets are in the red, with the exception of Bitcoin and, surprisingly enough, Stellar. In fact, the Stellar price notes some minor gains on this Friday afternoon, which can be quite interesting to keep an eye on over the coming days. With Bitcoin still on wobbly legs and the other 2 top markets in the market cap top 3 going in the red, one would expect all other markets to follow suit. While that is the case for most projects, it would appear Stellar is an exception. Although its uptrend is not small by any means, it might not necessarily be all that sustainable either. Increments in XLM/BTC will be required to keep this train going over the course of the weekend. Over the past 24 hours, the Stellar price has risen by 3.3% in USD value and 3% over Bitcoin itself. This is very positive and seemingly consistent growth, which is all one can ask for. Because of this rise in value, one XLM is now priced at $0.08865, or 2,255 Satoshi. Sustaining this level will not necessarily be complicated, as long as the trading volume doesn\u2019t drop off a cliff all of a sudden. On social media, there are plenty of people watching the XLM charts right now. That is only normal, as most users simply want to make money at any given time. Right now, Stellar is the most lucrative top market to do so. CryptoJebo expects another uptrend to materialize after the C wave has been completed. An interesting outlook, although there are never any guarantees. Nicky Crypto, on the other hand, is quite pleased with the profits secured by buying XLM at the most opportune time. For the time being, reaching $0.09 might be a bit too difficult, although it seems there is plenty of room for further upward momentum. Whether or not that will materialize over the weekend, has yet to be determined at this point. For those users who simply want to make a lot of money without paying much attention to potential price swings, the following triangular arbitrage opportunity is worth looking into. With a potential profit of up to 36.5%, there is some good money to be made. One downside is how one has to use both EXMO and BitBns to make this happen, which might not appeal to too many people. Considering how XLM is nearly the only top 10 market noting any real gains right now, the coming weekend will prove to be very peculiar and interesting. If Stellar can buck the negative trend affecting other top markets for a few more days, a push to $0.1 is not entirely out of the question either. At the same time, it is pertinent for traders not to get ahead of themselves under these promising circumstances. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While there is still a long way to until major breakouts occur, it would seem no real damage is to be expected today. The Binance Coin price is still going strong today, as the $15 resistance level has been obliterated without any real problems. The past few weeks have been pretty interesting for select cryptocurrency markets. While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP have not necessarily noted any real changes, it would appear Binance Coin is following a completely different path. That in itself is rather commendable, although many people expected the token tied to the world\u2019s leading crypto exchange to perform well. This recent 30-day trend, however, is pretty significant. Even in the past 24 hours, the Binance Coin price noted a strong 14% gain in USD value. This pushes the price to $15.4. There is also a 13.3% increase over both Bitcoin and Ethereum. It has been a remarkable trend for BNB throughout 2019, especially when considering how all other markets have performed. Binance Coin also notes healthy trading volume with $234m in trades. As was to be expected, this BNB price movement is making a lot of people rather nervous. As BenjaminBlunts points out, a lot of people are trying to call the top on Binance Coin and failing miserably. It remains to be seen how long this trend can be extended, yet the previous all-time high is coming within reach as of right now. That in itself shows the coming days and weeks will undoubtedly get very interesting. When looking at the actual price chart for the past thirty days, it quickly becomes apparent the bull run is firmly in place. More specifically, the price rose from $7.8 on February 5th to $15.4 on March 7th. A remarkable turn of events, primarily because no other market has turned as bullish as BNB. Sustaining this trend should become a lot more difficult, although there are still no imminent signs of weakness. According to Crypto Leb, it seems rather unlikely anything positive will come of this in the coming days and weeks. This user expects Bitcoin to \u201cstart ripping\u201d again, which usually doesn\u2019t bode well for any of the alternative markets. Although the impact on BNB has yet to be determined at this point, it is very likely there will be some sort of blowback on Binance Coin when it happens. Based on the current and recent BNB market momentum, it remains to be seen what the future will hold for Binance Coin. Although there is a chance this uptrend will be resumed, some resistance will begin forming pretty quickly. With a near 100% gain over the past month, a lot of traders will start taking profits fairly quickly. Once that happens, things will undoubtedly get very interesting for BNB holders and speculators.

VeChain is an interesting example in this regard, primarily because the current gains are quite severe. Although it remains to be seen how long this VeChain price will remain intact, a gift horse should never be looked in the mouth. With Bitcoin is still stuck in sideways trading and both ETH and XRP slowly lose value, it seems things are not looking too great for most cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean all markets will go through a bearish phase at this time, as VeChain clearly shows. It is one of the few markets successfully making a positive impact. Based On the current circumstances, this uptrend may not necessarily remain in place for long, though. To put this in perspective, the VeChain price has noted a 6% gain across the board. In USD terms, the price is pushed up to $0.004567. The VET/BTC ratio looks a bit bleak at 117 Satoshi, although no drop below 100 Satoshi is on the horizon at this time. One thing to keep in mind is how VeChain notes very little trading volume, although that hasn\u2019t been too much of a problem in the past few months. Picking up the pace in this regard would put a lot of traders\u2019 minds at ease, though. The big VeChain news of the week is how there will be a VeChain Summit in 2019. According to social media, the event will occur in San Francisco, and it seems tickets can be purchased with VET. A very prominent turn of events, although no one knows for sure what kind of announcements can be expected at this time. Events like these will usually offer some exciting news, thus the expectations for this event will be rather high. For those traders and holders who are merely interested in the current and future price, it remains to be seen how this market will evolve. JG, for example, expects the price to drop to 113 Satoshi before bouncing back strongly in a few weeks from today. So far, it seems the upward trend is already in place, and 113 Satoshi might not necessarily be reached again this week. A different point of view is provided by Mind Trader. This user can see this bull trend continuing over the next few days. One requirement for such a trend to remain in place is to effectively keep the VET/BTC ratio above 118 Satoshi. That level is still under a lot of pressure right now, although it remains to be seen if it will hold or fall. The coming hours will prove to be quite interesting in this regard. All things considered, it would appear VeChain is in a pretty good place right now. Although there are no actual major developments to take note of at this time, it seems the community is hyped about the upcoming Summit. That in itself can usually trigger some positive market momentum these days. With the weekend just around the corner, it seems as of some interesting market momentum can be expected.

So far the damage has been fairly limited in that regard. Even so, the Tron price has dipped in the red ever so slightly, although there doesn\u2019t appear to be a genuine reason for this sudden change. For the time being, it remains to be seen how long this uneasy situation will remain in place. Although Bitcoin is not exactly in a strong position right now, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is not subjected to a ton of bearish market pressure either. This should, in theory, ensure most of the top alternative markets remain in the green as well. While that is partially the case, markets such as Tron are already dipping in the red. This is primarily due to TRX/BTC losses being recorded in the past few hours. Over the past 24 hours, the balance for Tron is not too great. A 1.6% drop in USD value and a 1.8% decline over Bitcoin drive the Tron price down to $0.023252, or 594 Satoshi. Losing control of the 600 Satoshi level will undoubtedly make some traders nervous, albeit it seems this will only be a temporary setback. There are some interesting Tron-related developments to take note of. First of all, TRX will be listed on the OKEx C2C platform in the near future. While OKEx is no longer considered to be one of the biggest exchanges, it can still offer sufficient liquidity. TRX Was previously available for spot and derivatives trading, but it will now come to the C2C market as well. Secondly, the Tron Foundation has also confirmed Justin Sun will be attending the Token 20149 event in Hong Kong. While it remains to be seen if any surprise announcements can be expected, getting the word out about this project will always attract some attention. Even though Tron has become a recognizable brand, there is always more work to do in the marketing and educational department. Last but not least, a new dApp is making the rounds, although Tron users should be wary of it. Known as Mega Chicken, this dApp is a never-ending investment game. It seems most community members expect to lose money through this particular project, thus it would be best for users to conduct their own thorough research first and foremost. Not every dApp is worth looking into, for obvious reasons. All things considered, the current TRX price momentum doesn\u2019t appear to make any sense. Nothing negative has happened, yet some investors are seemingly cashing out in favor of Bitcoin. With the weekend just around the corner, this bearish trend can easily be extended unless something changes overnight. For now, no steeper losses are to be expected, although these volatile markets are always unpredictable. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/abbc-coin-price-pump-continues-with-another-60-gain/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "ABBC Coin Price Pump Continues With Another 60% Gain", "content": "There are always some developments in the cryptocurrency world which might not make too much sense at first. One surprising development involving ABBC Coin. This relatively unknown altcoin has entered the market cap top 25. Even today, the ABBC Coin price is surging quite hard, as it seeks entry into the crypto market cap top 20. Whether or not this growth can be sustained for very long, is a different matter altogether. Every time a relatively unknown cryptocurrency starts to rise in value, an opportunity for making good money is created. In the case of ABBC Coin, that profit potential has surpassed nearly everyone\u2019s expectations in recent weeks. Its value has risen from $0.065 to $0.628 in a matter of weeks, without meeting too much resistance. That is a rather interesting turn of events, primarily because this currency ha snot generated too much buzz since its ICO in March of 2018. Over the past 24 hours, the ABBC Coin price has risen by another 63% in USD and BTC value alike. That in itself is a very spectacular gain, especially for a coin with a total supply of just over 1 billion coins. As a result of this push, one ABBC is now valued at $0.6289, or 0.00016 Bitcoin. With a market cap of just over $250m, it seems ABBC coin is well on its way to enter the crypto market cap top 20. That is, assuming these gains can be sustained for a few days, rather than mere hours. For those who are unaware of what ABBC coin actually does, it is time for a recap. ABBC is designed to focus on distribution, finance, shopping, security, and using blockchain technology. It has mobile applications for iOS and Android, as its native wallet supports multiple cryptocurrencies. The team also completed its ICO in Q2 2018, after which the wallet received facial recognition support. Additionally, the ABBC Shopping mall opened its doors to bring more use cases for this coin to the table. On paper, none of this sounds too exciting or unique in the cryptocurrency world. Although the project has development teams in Dubai, Belarus, and Pakistan, that in itself shouldn\u2019t warrant such a major price increase either. Although it seems this currency could be successful in the future, one has to keep in mind it may not necessarily do anything other currencies cannot. For speculators, this price run is quite enticing, but for ABBC users, it seems little has changed in recent months. There isn\u2019t much excitement regarding ABBC Coin on social media these days either. CoinBene is trying to keep the hopium alive, although an exchange shouldn\u2019t necessarily blatantly advertise a coin on their platform. The most popular exchange for ABBC is IDAX, followed by Bit-Z, and RightBTC. Not the most prominent exchanges by any means, although all pairs in the top 10 generate over $1m in 24-hour volume. When looking at the big picture, it would appear ABBC Coin is going through a hefty pump cycle, although it remains to be seen if a subsequent dump will materialize in the coming days and weeks. Assuming that is the case, a 90% retrace would not entirely be out of the question either. For now, chasing the top of ABBC Coin is not advised, regardless of how appealing the current momentum may look at this time. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Although considered to be a joke project by a lot of people, the Dogecoin brand is one of the most resilient ones on the market today. Unfortunately for holders, it seems the Dogecoin price isn\u2019t returning to $0.002 as of yet. While the current DOGE value isn\u2019t too far off, it seems there is a lot of resistance to contend with at this time. Not too many people would have expected a bullish Dogecoin trend at this time. This particular altcoin always behaves in odd ways, either for better or worse. Although DOGE follows the general uptrend across the industry, it does so in a seemingly unconvincing manner. Reclaiming the $0.002 level has proven to be difficult, if not nigh impossible. That is slightly worrisome, from a short-term perspective. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a minor Dogecoin price change. A 0.95% increase in USD value is insufficient to break the $0.002 resistance, albeit just barely. The 0.37% increase in DOGE/BTC won\u2019t get too many people excited either, as the 51 Satoshi level remains in play. Those who seek Bitcoin gains by investing in DOGE will have to bide their time if this trend continues. One of the main objectives of any cryptocurrency is to gain traction. An unnamed Minecraft hosting company has now begun accepting Dogecoin payments, according to the Reddit post below. It is a minor development when looking at the bigger picture, yet it only further confirms how strong the Dogecoin brand really is these days. It is a payment method first and foremost, rather than a speculative vehicle. In further promising news, it seems at least one additional Dogecoin network node will be coming online shortly. Patata Cuantica confirms the node is syncing. Although this is not necessarily something to get excited about, having individual users run a network node is always invaluable. Any crypto network is only as strong as its network nodes, and Dogecoin is no exception. MovableSingularity, on the other hand, would like to point out the development side of Dogecoin is still ongoing. Instead, this user claims the DOGE developers are building on a different repository prior to making the information public. That approach would explain a few things, and it is also an understandable decision. For now, this remains unconfirmed, though. Although the current Dogecoin trend is not necessarily spectacular, the currency remains in the green without too many problems. That is all long-term holders and investors can ask for at this time. Unless something major changes, it seems unlikely the price of this altcoin will undergo any real changes in the coming days. One never knows what could happen during the weekend, however.

Whereas Bitcoin is still on wobbly legs, it seems the XRP price isn\u2019t making any move to break out either. Its minor losses in BTC value put a lot of pressure on the market right now, which is why the USD ratio remains virtually the same. For the time being, it seems as if this uneasy momentum will continue for a little while longer. When Bitcoin remains in a bit of an awkward state, it is only normal to assume the alternative markets will go through similar momentum. That is not uncommon in this industry, and it will seemingly continue to happen for some time to come. Unfortunately for some of the top markets, this uneasy momentum doesn\u2019t allow these other projects to move in a decisive direction either. XRP is a great example in this regard, as it simply cannot move up or down right now. While some XRP price stability will certainly be appreciated, it also makes for a somewhat \u201cboring\u201d market. With a net gain of 0.46% in USD value, one XRP is still valued at $0.316502. In terms of XRP/BTC, there is a 0.05% decrease. With one XRP now valued at 8,079 Satoshi, a drop below 8,000 Satoshi seemingly becomes a lot more plausible. That is not a development investors and holders are looking for, but it is seemingly impossible to delay the inevitable. Richard Morgan is sharing some interesting albeit wildly speculative and totally unconfirmed rumors regarding XRP. This user claims the IMF will make a major announcement in a few weeks. While that in itself wouldn\u2019t be out of the ordinary whatsoever, it is a bit unclear what this could possibly mean for Ripple or XRP. After all, the correlation the IMF and XRP still remains uncertain at this time. Make of this \u201cinformation\u201d what you will. Mark Brown, on the other hand, would like to remind people these are still the very early days of cryptocurrency and digital assets. Bitcoin faced a fair bit of resistance during its first ten years, thus there is no reason to expect XRP to fare any better or worse in this regard. While there is never a guarantee the price will improve moving forward, it seems there will be some changes at some point in the future. For those who are interested in the actual price chart, it would appear the coming hours will be crucial. If the price fails to break out of this current formation in a positive manner, it seems likely to assume the market will turn slightly more bearish in the days and weeks to come. However, it wouldn\u2019t take that much effort to turn this market bullish. As such, it will be an interesting weekend, even though not too much should be expected from it either. All things considered, it seems as if XRP will continue its sideways momentum for quite some time to come. Although that is not necessarily a bad thing by any means, one has to keep in mind the bullish momentum hasn\u2019t returned to Bitcoin either. Until the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency decides to get its act together, it seems unlikely any of the alternative top markets will see much in terms of bullish momentum.

For now, it seems no real problems have been detected as of yet, although some hourly charts are not looking too promising. Despite the pressure, the EOS price is still going strong, albeit a push to $4 may be a bit too much to handle right now. In the cryptocurrency world, there is always a chance things will turn around when people least expect it. Although it seems Bitcoin will not dip in the red today either, that sentiment will always remain subject to change. As long as Bitcoin remains bullish, all of the other markets will follow a very similar pattern. EOS is currently benefiting tremendously from Bitcoin\u2019s surge, even though it too gains on BTC in its own way. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a hefty 13.4% increase as far as the EOS price is concerned. Additionally, there is a near 10% gain in EOS/BTC< which is perhaps the most interesting aspect as of right now. Combined with $2.46bn in trading volume, it appears EOS is doing a lot of things right, primarily because its trading volume continues to increase accordingly. On the social media platforms, there are some very interesting EOS-related discussions taking place. First of all, it appears some users are annoyed with Pokerking.one putting commercial messages on the EOS blockchain. While doing so is perfectly fine, one has to wonder how much blockchain spam will be created in the process. Not overdoing it is always the best course of action. In more positive news, the Unlimited Tower SRPG game will be making its way to alpha testing very soon. Although the details for participation have yet to be announced, it will be a full-fledged game powered by the EOS blockchain. Developments like these can have a significant impact on the project as a whole, assuming the game is worth its salt, of course. For those crypto traders simply chasing profits, it would appear there are a few interesting arbitrage opportunities worth looking into. More specifically, the potential profits range from 1.79% to 2.5%, which is more than acceptable for altcoin and token trading these days. It does involve using some of the lesser-known exchanges, however, thus trading liquidity can prove to be somewhat problematic at times. All things considered, it would appear the EOS price should maintain the current level of $3.75 throughout the day. A further push is not entirely out of the question either, albeit there seems to be insufficient momentum to push the value to $4 in quick succession. That is not necessarily a bad thing, as a gain of over 13% should not be overlooked by any means. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/dogecoin-price-remains-below-0-002-as-doge-btc-gets-hammered/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Dogecoin Price Remains Below $0.002 as DOGE/BTC Gets Hammered", "content": "As most of the top crypto markets are turning bullish again, it seems as if things will finally begin moving up in general. Surprisingly, it seems the Dogecoin price is not seeing too much action to get excited about right now. Instead, its net loss in BTC value is keeping the USD value below $0.002, for the time being. Not necessarily what one would have expected to see at this time. When it comes to looking at individual cryptocurrency markets, there will always be some exceptions to the general trend. In most cases, one would expect Dogecoin to see to turn bullish alongside other markets, albeit in a more subdued manner. Today, however, it would appear that is not the case, as the DOGE price remains on the bearish side of the spectrum. To put this in perspective, the Dogecoin price in USD value has risen by 0.09%. Not the biggest gain, especially when considering how one DOGE is valued at $0.001984. Reaching $0.002 again is certainly possible, but it is simply not happening as of yet. In terms of DOGE/BTC, there is a net 2.32% loss, which is perhaps the most worrisome aspect. The current 51 Satoshi level may not remain in place for very long, by the look of things. On social media, there is hardly ever any negative sentiment toward Dogecoin. Even today, Shibatoshi Dogomoto is convinced going all-in on Dogecoin is the smart choice. Never put one\u2019s eggs in the same basket, though, as that will usually cause financial trouble in the long run. Dogecoin is a stable currency, though, but it may not necessarily yield spectacular gains in the coming weeks and months. Some Dogecoin community members are still fond of the Dogecar days. I certainly was an intriguing sight to see a NASCAR race where one car\u2019s design was all about Dogecoin and this mysterious cryptocurrency. Back in those days, cryptocurrencies in general were a lot simpler and there were a lot less scams as well. Even so, there is a chance Dogecoin will rise again in terms of mainstream media exposure, but it may not happen anytime soon. A meme a day often keeps the bad juju away, even in the cryptocurrency world. Dogecoin Memes has everyone covered in this regard. Its latest meme further confirms Dogecoin will receive a new update fairly soon. There is also some attention for the recently launched DOGE/USD pair on Vertbase. That latter development is a pretty big deal, although it might not necessarily affect the price in a significant manner. Although the DOGE/BTC ratio is evolving in the wrong direction, it seems unlikely too much damage will be done in the next few days. It is not uncommon for altcoins to lose BTC value when Bitcoin is rising in value. Dogecoin is seemingly going through such a trend right now, yet it seems the momentum may shift again in the near future. Until that happens, speculators will need to endure this bearish pressure for a little longer. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

For Bitcoin and Litecoin, the Lightning Network is considered to be the \u201choly grail\u201d of scaling and instant payments right now. While it remains to be seen if that will effectively be the case, it appears things are progressing smoothly. Litecoin still has a lot of catching up to do, but that is entirely to be expected. One particular aspect about the Lightning Network is how it is a technological implementation which doesn\u2019t just work for Bitcoin. Any cryptocurrency which has activated Segregated Witness in the past \u2013 or plans to do so in the future \u2013 will be capable of enabling LN support at some point. Litecoin was the first major currency to enable SegWit even ahead of Bitcoin, thus it is only normal its community is exploring the Lightning Network as well. So far, it seems the interest in this new technology as has been somewhat lackluster. While there are numerous payment channels, the figures are not necessarily getting people excited. Some recent changes have allowed the number of Lightning Network channels on Litecoin to rise to just above 1,000. An important first milestone, which can lead to even more payment channels being created over the coming months and years. This increase in Litecoin LN payment channels coincides with a strong LTC price push. It has been well documented how the value of Litecoin has surpassed $50 in recent days. It is possible this rise in value has led to more LN payment channels being created, although that is always difficult to confirm. The current 1,012 channels are operated between 161 participants, further confirming this is still a rather small-scale effort. That situation will keep changing constantly, as cryptocurrencies are always evolving. The Lightning Network for Litecoin \u2013 or any other currency \u2013 will stand or fall based on overall financial capacity. For Litecoin, there is just over $7,000 in \u201cliquid funds\u201d, which is not necessarily impressive. However, a few weeks ago, that figure sat at just under $4,000. A very promising increase in such a short span of time. It seems unlikely Litecoin\u2019s LN will ever reach the same level as Bitcoin, although one never knows how things will pan out in a few months or years from now. While the Litecoin statistics are not looking all that bad, Bitcoin is still dominating the landscape right now. With just over 7,000 LN nodes and nearly 32,000 payment channels, Bitcoin is doing quite well in this regard. Its overall network capacity has also risen to nearly $3m. A very solid figure, but there is always room for further improvements. That applies to both Bitcoin and Litecoin alike in this regard. As both networks seem to note a hefty increase in Lightning Network activity, things will get very interesting in the coming months and years. Litecoin is an interesting \u201ccompetitor\u201d to Bitcoin in this regard, even though it is well behind the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency at this stage. It would also appear Litecoin is getting some Onion-capable Lightning network nodes as of late, which should yield some interesting use cases over time.

February 25, 2019, Denmark\u2013 Hypnoxys (HYPX) is a project with the dream of decentralizing the \u2018chatting industry\u2019 and as such, has developed a multi-functional messenger app and protocol that delivers all the staples of instant messaging such as group chats, audio, and video calls etc., whilst also offering a native token that can be earned through using the application. Time for Change Instant messengers come in all shapes and sizes, though they typically offer simplistic over-used features that are lacking in innovation and are simply advertising revenue streams for their stakeholders. Furthermore, centralized systems have been taking advantage of user data and conversations for quite some time, and that needs to change. With HYPX, it will change. By tapping into blockchain technology, users can rest easy knowing that their conversations aren\u2019t visible to centralized entities. They are instead bolstered by the tech and made highly secure through encryption. Messages for straight from the user to the blockchain without any go-betweens, they are then encrypted with a process called HYPX-crypt, making them impossible to be decrypted by anyone. Incentives On the multiplatform Dapp (Decentralized Application), the native crypto, HYPX, can be earned by holders of the token who utilize the application and willingly accept advertising. Additionally, when a user holds 5,000,000 HYPX tokens and adds advertising to the application, their HYPX earnings are boosted by a 1.25x multiplier, and higher revenue can be gained. Furthermore, HYPX can be transferred between users through the Dapp, paving the way for a possible ecosystem to develop and grow in the HYPX community. Now and Then The HYPX model has proven successful with investors and users. Hypnoxys distributed over 31,000,000,000 tokens through its token sale, pre-sale, and with the help of two Denmark-based venture capital firms, raising a hard cap of $2,234,000 for the project in a matter of days. Having launched the Open Alpha version of the Dapp which is available now, the team is now looking ahead into roadmap as it sets out to achieve its aims. Next up in March, the team will look to have the HYPX token listed on exchanges. Then over the following months, the Dapp will receive a lot of attention as the fine-tuning including implementation of additional features will take priority, edging closer to the final product. There are many projects, blockchain or not, who are vying for a portion of the messenger market, one that is diverse and gigantic. But none are doing in such a way where the users benefit from not only having peace of mind, knowing their discussions and data aren\u2019t being tapped, but also having a means to passively earn crypto on the platform.

A fair few people will be surprised to see the Electroneum price is still bearish at this time. Its losses in both USD and BTC value continue to pile up, which is not necessarily what most people would have expected to see right now. It is safe to say the Electroneum market has seen some interesting momentum in recent months. When most markets were down, the value of ETN would often offer a bit of a reprieve. That is no longer today, although the reason why remains unclear. With all top markets enjoying bullish momentum, it is all the stranger to see Electroneum turn uber bearish all of a sudden. Over the past 24 hours, the Electroneum price has lost nearly 6% in USD value, driving the price down to $0.005832. There is also the 8.82% loss over Bitcoin, which is something to be even more concerned about right now. This particular drop has forced ETN down to 150 Satoshi, a value traders hadn\u2019t expected to see for quite some time to come. Even so, ETN is doing the exact opposite of all other markets, for some unknown reason. There is another big Electroneum-related development which can put a positive spin on the ecosystem. More specifically, there is a partnership involving ETN and South Africa\u2019s The Unlimited mobile provider. Users can earn double airtime and double data when they top up their balance with Electroneum. It is a major development for this mobile-oriented cryptocurrency, although it doesn\u2019t appear to impact the price in a positive manner. As far as the ETN community is concerned, it would appear another \u201ccall to arms\u201d is on the horizon. CryptoLady wonders which community is stronger between Digibyte, XRP, and Electroneum. So far, it seems as if Digibyte is getting the most votes, even though these Twitter polls never amount to much in the end. For the time being, however, it is an interesting \u201cdebate\u201d to keep an eye on. CryptoSuaveA is wondering how and when Electorneum will make a strong impact in the price department. Although the current crypto winter has not lasted over two years \u2013 it has been in effect for 17 months \u2013 it seems as if ETN is turning wintery again. Additionally, the currency saw a fair few short upward bursts whereas other markets remained in the red. As such, it seems ETN will do just fine in the long run, despite the current minor setback. All things considered, it seems the value of Electroneum will return to normal levels sooner or later. While this wave of bearish pressure is rather unexpected at this time, it seems there is nothing to be overly concerned about as of right now. The ongoing mobile expansion is still in play. With this interesting partnership in South Africa, a valuable precedent has been created. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Most of the top markets remain in the green, albeit just barely. For the XRP price, there is nothing to be overly concerned about. Its minuscule gain in USD value is promising, and the status quo in XRP/BTC is being maintained without too many problems. Although a lot of traders would love to see some major bullish momentum in the crypto industry today, it will not be happening. After yesterday\u2019s minor sure, today is all about maintaining the status quo for most markets. That is never a bad thing, as less volatility is what the industry really needs at this time. Even the XRP value has remained nearly flat, although the community isn\u2019t worried in the slightest. Over the past 24 hours, there hasn\u2019t been any notable XRP price change to take note of. A 0.4% increase in USD value brings the price to $0.316839. The 0% difference in XRP/BTC ensures the 8,114 Satoshi level can be maintained for a while longer. As long as XRP doesn\u2019t lose value over Bitcoin, there should be no real price pressure to speak of. On social media, there is still an ongoing war\u2019 brewing between XRP supporters and Forbes and Bloomberg. Both media outlets are accused of spreading misinformation regarding Ripple and XRP. This debacle has been going on for over a week now, yet it seems no resolution can be found at this time. Rest assured this debate will spill over to the coming days as well. ESFXRobo is confident there will be some promising momentum for XRP in the days and weeks to come. As long as the $0.31 level holds true, a further push to $.035 should not necessarily be too complex. However, there hasn\u2019t been ay sign of a confirmed outbreak for XRP or any other currency, token, or asset. As such, any scenario remains in play for now, although a decisive sign would be appreciated. Although it has seemingly gone by almost unnoticed, there is now a song about XRP on YouTube. It has been \u201cwatched\u2019 over 10,000 times already, which is rather interesting to take note of. Songs themed around cryptocurrencies, tokens, or assets are always interesting, even though they hardly ever remain relative for very long. Even so, it is another way of getting people excited about this asset. All things considered, it seems as if XRP is performing as expected. The lack of bullish momentum \u2013 or a bearish trend \u2013 is something to keep in mind at all times, albeit it doesn\u2019t have to be a negative thing by any means. With all top markets still fractionally in the green at the time of writing, there is plenty of reason to be cautiously optimistic. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

The downtrend reached 61.80% Fibo, while now the price may go up to the local resistance at $133.70. Once it happens, the crypto may both rise to $144 and bounce and hit the support at $119.45. Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum founder, told Business Insider that his major goal was to create a crypto that would enhance Bitcoin capabilities and functions. Those are currently restricted to a single purpose (like those of a calculator), he says, and while the BTC performs it well, it is not enough. Ethereum is more like a smartphone, Buterin added, as it can support quite a few apps at a time. The Ethereum founder also commented on the cryptos he invests into. Of course, ETH is the major investment; however, around 10% of his money is invested into Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, ZCash, and others. Constantinople, a new Ethereum\u2019s update, was successfully released in late February, which reduced the block mining time from around 21s to 12.50s, which is a record low. The hard fork was released without any major issues, and the hash rate was fine, too. Once Constantinople got released, the ETH devs started planning the new strategy.

Except for Tether, none of the top markets is still in the red at the time of writing. The biggest gainer so far is Binance Coin, as its value is seemingly going off the charts quite quickly. A promising Binance Coin price trend for those who invested in this token many moons ago. When looking at all of the top 20 crypto markets, it quickly becomes apparent one particular listing outperforms everything else with ease. Binance Coin has been on an absolute tear in early 2019, and it is seemingly well underway to record a new all-time high in very quick succession. To be more specific, the all-time high for BNB sits at $17.08, whereas the current value is $13.58. Not that big of a gap, at least when compared to all other markets. Over the past 24 hours, the Binance Coin price rose by another 21.5% in USD value, 50.6% in BTC value, and gained 18.6% on Ethereum. All of these trends are incredible in their own right, as BNB turned bullish well ahead before Bitcoin was able to finally slide over into the green again. Considering how one BNB is now worth 10% of one Ether, things have gotten very interesting in the cryptocurrency industry all of a sudden. No one will be surprised to learn there are a lot of people unhappy about the fact they never bought into the BNB ICO. At that time, some tokens were valued at less than 0.5% of their current value. Even so, no one expected Binance to become the biggest crypto exchange in the world. The company has surprised a lot of people in a positive manner lately, and the price is showing it. This sentiment is echoed by BlueNET Crypto, who acknowledge Binance Coin wouldn\u2019t be as successful without the Binance team putting in so much work. There is certainly a case to be made there. No cryptocurrency project can ever attain a high value without a solid ecosystem surrounding it. In the case of BNB, new use cases continue to be added on a regular basis these days. This only further shows there is a lot more to this token than initially meets the eye. When looking at the actual BBN price chart, however, it quickly becomes apparent this current trend may be too bullish to sustain for very long. A 20%+ gain in mere hours will usually result in a correction waiting to happen. However, BNB has always been a different breed in the cryptocurrency industry, and it seems there is plenty of support to keep this party going a while longer. In the end, it is not surprising to Binance Coin pop off first and foremost. This was a matter of time, as all other markets are either too fragile to move up or simply face too much resistance to make any big jumps occur. BNB is DOing its own thing in this regard, although that won\u2019t automatically lead to a new all-time high in the coming days. There will be plenty of resistance along the way.

If the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency shows bullish momentum, all other markets will too. The Tron price is currently one of those markets trying to turn bullish. Following the recent announcement of USDT tokens coming to Tron, that is not entirely surprising either. When everything comes up positive in the cryptocurrency industry, it is only normal something happens to the prices of individual projects. After a very rough start to the week yesterday, it would appear as if things are slowly returning to normal all of a sudden. The Tron market is an interesting example in this regard, as it too is gaining a lot of value in very quick succession. This has many different reasons and is not just a direct result of Bitcoin moving up. To put everything in perspective, the Tron price has risen by 6.7% in the past 24 hours. This brings the value per TRX back to $00022886, which is not all that bad. There is also a 5.92% gain on Bitcoin, which is rather telling under these circumstances. Altcoins need to gain on Bitcoin if they want to start positioning themselves for a bull run again. So far, it seems that is exactly what is happening, as similar momentum can be noted across the different altcoins right now. The big news this week is how Tron will be getting its own version of USDT tokens. Tether has confirmed they will issue TRC-20 versions of the USDT asset on the Tron blockchain. Although no official launch date has been announced at this time, it is a development which has many people excited right now. It is still too early to say whether or not this will effectively lead to any major developments in the Tron ecosystem. Secondly, it would appear a relatively new service has been added tot he Tron network. Known as Trongram, it will seemingly let users spread messages to the entire community. While such a service can certainly be a worthwhile addition, one has to wonder if many people are interested in spending TRX for such a purpose. Even so, any addition is a promising development. For those traders who are only looking at the current Tron chart, it would appear there may be a fair bit of resistance on the horizon. Although the overall uptrend is seemingly locked in place, there is always a chance things will turn around when people least expect it. In the case of Tron, it will all depend on how the TRX/BTC ratio evolves in the coming hours. A collapse in that department can easily send the USD value in a negative spiral. With all of the top crypto markets turning bullish once again, a very interesting situation has been created. Although most people expect some form of upward momentum to materialize this week, one never knows for certain until it actually happens. Now is not the time to get ahead of oneself either, as there is still a long way to go before an uptrend is officially locked in place. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Modest gains are seemingly not on the agenda for some projects today, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The Litecoin price, for example, is popping off after breaking through the $50 resistance level without any noteworthy problems. The year 2019 has been very kind to a handful of cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets so far. While that doesn\u2019t necessarily apply to the markets most people would expect, Litecoin holders will be quite happy with the way things have gone recently. Today is another example of why this project is worth keeping an eye on, as LTC has noted some incredibly solid gains in quick succession. Over the past 24 hours, it has been very interesting to keep an eye on the Litecoin price. Following a 13.8% gain in USD value, one LTC is now priced at $52.86. There is also a near 10% gain over Bitcoin, which pushes the ratio to 0.01357 BTC. Very solid developments where Litecoin is concerned, as this market puts some of its competitors to shame. There is a very interesting development taking place on social media. LTC Whale Watcher has noted how one of the biggest Litecoin whales has continued to accumulate as the price moved up. Another 32,733 LTC has made its way to this particular wallet address. It is unclear if this user keeps funds on an exchange, a hardware wallet, or otherwise. Even so, it seems some investors genuinely keep the faith in LTC. In terms of future price predictions, the sky\u2019s the proverbial limit where Litecoin is concerned. Liveitup2050b wouldn\u2019t mind seeing one LTC valued at $200 in December of 2019. While that is not necessarily unlikely whatsoever, it would appear that projection is rather optimistic. One good day of trading in March doesn\u2019t equal a nine-month bull run by default. When looking at the actual LTC price chart, it seems there is not that much resistance to contend with, for the time being. That is quite intriguing for many different reasons. If people are not putting up sell orders, they are either waiting for a higher price or plan to dump into open buy orders pretty soon. Either outcome will be rather interesting to keep an eye on. With nearly 14% worth of gains already in the books, it seems to be a matter of time until Litecoin this a proverbial glass ceiling. Every uptrend needs to be met with some sort of pullback fairly quickly if it is destined to resume the uptrend over time. The bullish amount of LTC trading volume, however, seems to indicate a pullback might not happen just yet. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While some currencies are off the chart right now, Cardano takes a more modest and manageable approach. A 6.4% Cardano price increase is nothing to sneeze at, although it seems the accumulation phase might not be over yet. Whereas most currencies are trying to note double-digit percentage gains over Bitcoin, Cardano is not necessarily too concerned with that particular trend. Although the altcoin benefits from Bitcoin\u2019s rise in value like any other, it would seem the push is a lot slower and more deliberate. That in itself is an approach which will often yield great results over a longer period of time. To put this in perspective, the Cardano price has risen by 6.4% in USD value and just 2.82% in BTC value. Because of these gains, one ADA is now priced at $0.043324, or 1,113 Satoshi. Although some traders may be dismayed by the lack of a genuine pump, uptrends like these should ideally last numerous days, if not weeks. Massive gains in the first few hours will ensure a lengthy uptrend cannot occur. It would appear the Cardano community is cooking up an interesting plan. Anthony Tucci, for example, would like to see a lengthy debate between Charles Hoskinson and Andreas Antonopoulos regarding Bitcoin and Cardano. Although it appears neither party is opposed to the idea, one has to wonder if there is anything to gain from doing so. Definitely something worth looking forward to, if it ever were to happen. In more tangible news, the upcoming Input Output event in Miami is getting a lot of Cardano enthusiasts excited. This summit is expected to take place on April 17-18 of 2019. What it will entail exactly, is always a bit of a guess. Some potential new announcements could be on the horizon, as there are several references to \u201cblockchain 3.0\u201d. A bit of mystery usually does wonders for the price of any cryptocurrency. For those who are primarily interested in the actual Cardano chart, it seems the accumulation phase for ADA may not necessarily be over yet. An extended period of sideways trading has been noted in recent weeks, and it seems this minor push will not necessarily change that situation. Based on the current industry momentum, it would appear things are heading in the right direction for Cardano and its competitors. As such, one has to wonder if this run will last very long or if it will result in a new downtrend in the coming hours. As of right now, it seems a market reversal seems rather implausible, although the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies should not be underestimated.

Bitcoin dictates the pace, which will undoubtedly put even more strain on alternative markets as more time progresses. Even the XRP price is not capable of mounting a comeback, even though the XRP/BTC ratio looks a lot more resilient compared to most other markets. It is not uncommon for alternative markets to create some negative sentiment in the cryptocurrency industry. Although they are not at fault for doing so as of right now, they will add to the overwhelming sentiment of how things will not improve anytime soon. In the case of XRP, the expected push in XRP/BTC is not happening as of right now, which is not necessarily what investors have been looking for. To put this in perspective, the XRP price lost another 3% in USD value, yet just lost 0.4% against Bitcoin. If the XRP/BTC ratio could somehow turn around all of a sudden, some of the USD-based losses could be offset as well. Until that happens, the 8,100 Satoshi level will need to act as further support, yet it remains to be seen if that will effectively be the case. In USD terms, XRP is now valued at $0.3047, but could very well drop below $0.3 in the coming hours. When looking across social media, it seems the overall sentiment toward all currencies, assets, and tokens is rather \u201cmeh\u201d. The recent Forbes article debating where or not Ripple \u2013 and its associated XRP asset \u2013 are a scam is not helping matters along in this regard either. While the article itself is raising some interesting points, it seems they have taken a harsh approach to this project for some reason. In more positive news, it would appear as if the XRP community is quite happy with the way things are going in tip bot land. More specifically, the XRP tip bot even has its own meme these days, which only further confirms this project is getting a bit of attention. It has proven to be a welcome addition to the ecosystem, as users can easily distribute XRP to anyone else by using social media. For those who want to look at the current price chart a bit closer, it would appear there is something interesting taking place as of right now. More specifically, the current XRP chart looks very similar to that of 2014 prior to the major bull run being triggered in the following months. It remains to be seen if history will repeat itself in this regard. There is always a chance things will play out in a similar manner, as this industry has seen numerous repeats over the years. It is evident things are not looking all that great in the cryptocurrency industry when even assets like XRP cannot find stable ground as of right now. Although this particular market shows some promising sign of growth in terms of noting gains over Bitcoin. Whether or not it will be possible to do so today, is a very different matter altogether.

Bitcoin is raining down upon all other currencies and eroding their support levels in rather quick succession. Even the Tron price is under a lot of pressure right now, as its value has dipped below $0.022 again. Retaining the current price point in USD and BTC value will pose its own set of challenges, for obvious reasons. It is only normal all other markets lose value when Bitcoin starts losing value again. Why this is happening now, of all times, is difficult to explain. It seems Bitcoin does its own thing first and foremost, but it doesn\u2019t bode well for the alternative markets so far. When even Tron is bleeding value all over the place, everyone can see things are not looking too great. However, there is always a chance the markets will recover when people least expect it. Over the past 24 hours, the Tron price has lost 5.7% in USD value and 3.3% in BTC value. These declines drive the price down to $0.021684, or 576 Satoshi. As long as the TRX/BTC trend remains in the red, it seems unlikely any form of recovery will materialize today. While the current Satoshi level is still rather solid, one has to keep in mind this can easily be driven down lower with a bit of extra trading volume. Although the current TRX price doesn\u2019t effectively confirm it, things are still looking pretty good for Tron behind the scenes. Several users confirm there are now over 2 million Tron accounts on the network, which is a very big milestone for any project. The push to 5 million is still in full effect, although it may take a while until that particular level is reached. Traders are seemingly not too dismayed by this most recent price drop, even though it may force them to take profits a bit quicker than normal. Alitolgausta bought in at 550 Satoshi, which indicates this particular user is still in profit as of right now. It might not be the profit he or she was looking for at first, but any profit is more than welcome when involved in cryptocurrencies. As has been the case for some time now, it appears there are a lot of interesting arbitrage opportunities involving various cryptocurrencies these days. Tron is no exception, as users can expect a profit of up to 1.54% for exploring price gaps between different crypto exchanges. Although these potential profits are not necessarily the most appealing, a bit of arbitrage a day can make people good money regardless. As no one knows why Bitcoin\u2019s value is plummeting once again, it is difficult to predict whether or not the momentum will turn around later today. It is certainly possible things will improve for Tron pretty soon, although that will mainly depend on Bitcoin first and foremost. With all of the promising developments behind the scenes of Tron, it seems unlikely the price can be kept down for an extended period of time. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Although most markets seemed ready to move up again yesterday night, things have turned out very bearish. The EOS price is a good example of this souring trend, as it is quickly losing ground across the board. It is never a good sign to see the top crypto markets open in the red on a Monday morning. While this may not be an indicator of what is yet to come later this week, everyone can see the bear market is far from over at this point. Despite some promising signs in February, it seems March will bring a lot more pressure for no apparent reason. This does not bode well for Bitcoin, nor for any of the alternative markets. As far as the EOS price is concerned, it seems the pressure is mounting quickly. With a net 6.5% drop in USD value already locked in, today could get very ugly for the top markets. This discrepancy pushes the EOS value down to $3.32, which might not be the bottom by any means. There is also a 4.4% loss in EOS/BTC, which is perhaps even more worrisome. Maintaining the 88,000 Satoshi threshold will prove incredibly challenging if this trend keeps up for a few more hours. One thing that can easily turn the situation around for EOS is its high trading volume. Even during the weekend, EOS had seemingly plenty of liquidity to go around. Today should be no different in that regard, although it will mainly depend on whether or not traders want to just sell or also look to cost-average down their investments. If the latter comes into play, this dip might be short-lived after all. On social media, Unlimited Tower continues to try and attract positive attention for EOS. The entity recently partnered with DexEOS, which is a decentralized exchange built on top of EOS technology. Although this partnership is a pretty big deal, it may not necessarily affect the end user right away. The ongoing growth of the EOS ecosystem cannot be denied, but that doesn\u2019t mean the price will respond in mind. There is also some community excitement regarding the \u201cupcoming public roadmap\u201d hinted at by Daniel Larimer. No one knows for sure whether or not this roadmap will impact the market in a positive manner, but it certainly gets people talking about EOS once again. It has been a while since a public plan of approach was presented by the EOS team, thus it is only normal people want to find out a bit more in the coming days and weeks. Although all of the market signs seem to confirm things are not looking good for EOS, everything is going rather smoothly behind the scenes. The public roadmap can trigger some market movements, either for better or worse. However, until Bitcoin shifts gears again, it seems unlikely any market will escape its gravitational pull into bearish territory. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Although not all of the momentum is bullish, it appears the Verge price is trying to move up in rather quick succession. Following some very strong progress in the past few hours, there is a chance Verge might actually re-enter the market cap top 50. It has gone relatively quiet on the Verge front as of late. Although this altcoin has attempted to break free from Bitcoin and the rest of the pack on many occasions, none of those efforts have garnered much attention for more than a few days on end. Even its partnership with Pornhub failed to impress the masses. Even so, the project is still going very strong these days, and its price is moving up rather nicely. To put this in perspective, the past 24 hours have been rather interesting for XVG. Following an 11.3% increase in both USD and BTC value, the Verge price now sits at $0.006749, or 176 Satoshi. Combined with nearly $12m in trading volume, there is a genuine chance this push may remain in place for the remainder of the day. On social media, there has never been a shortage of opinions regarding Verge. West Coasts Finest claims Verge has 1 coder stealing Bitcoin code, whereas the rest of the developers are not worth their salt either. These are very serious allegations first and foremost. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, even though the XVG community has taken exception to this statement. Crypto_Sky, on the other hand, is convinced Verge will be here to stay for quite some time to come. In fact, this user expects XVG to become a part of everyday life in one way or another It would be good to see cryptocurrencies gain more mainstream traction, yet no one knows exactly how and if that will ever happen exactly. Additionally, one has to wonder if XVG can succeed where others struggle. For those traders and speculators who are looking at the actual XVG price chart, it quickly becomes apparent only two scenarios can play out. Either this run turns gigantic and smashes past the current resistance levels. Another option is how this pump will peter out quickly and force the price lower compared to this morning. All things considered, Verge is perhaps one of the most exciting markets to keep an eye on today. While every other altcoin, token, or asset is trying to maintain its status quo, XVG is effectively moving up in quick succession. Given its history with pump-and-dump cycles, however, there is a chance this particular run might not necessarily last all that long either. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

With none of the main markets effectively making a significant move, there are a lot of uncertain factors to keep an eye on. As far as the Electroneum price is concerned, things are not looking bad or good right now. A status quo ensues, which is often better than unwarranted volatility. A fair few interesting developments have taken place in the land of Electroneum over the past few weeks. By officially launching the mobile mining app on iOS and Android, as well as joining the GSMA advisory board, a firm step in the right direction has been taken. However, it seems most of these developments have not affected the market value in the slightest. Over the past 24 hours, that status quo hasn\u2019t changed much either. The Electroneum price lost 0.02% in USD value and gained 0.05% in Bitcoin value. As such, the actual price seems to hold its own at $0.006436, or 167 Satoshi without too many problems. These developments are not necessarily inspiring, but still noteworthy. On social media, there is no lack of excitement when it comes to Electroneum. WALLSt is looking forward to the upcoming battle between Electroneum and XRP. It seems this Tweet pertains to the future market valuation of both projects. As such, Electroneum should gain value or XRP will collapse. Either development would be rather intriguing, although the latter seems the most improbable of the two. The launch of the mobile mining application has seemingly gotten a lot of people excited. CryptoMan976 confirms over 15,000 new signups were recorded since the Mobile World Congress 2019 event. With the total now climbing above $130,500, it seems things are looking relatively good for ETN in this regard. Crypto Steem Man is one of those people who likes to accumulate large amounts of coins when the markets turn bearish. This approach can usually help bring down the average cost of one\u2019s portfolio, although the potential profit waiting to be pocketed may not be too significant either. While the Electroneum value seems to be content with this state of affairs, it seems unlikely no changes should be expected in the future. All of the developments behind the scenes pave the way for interesting price shifts at some point in the future. Reclaiming the $0.007 level will be very difficult right now, although nothing is impossible in the cryptocurrency industry these days. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Bitcoin still seems uncertain as to which direction to head in over the coming days. This doesn\u2019t bode well for any of the top markets, as the XRP price is suffering from similar indecisive momentum. When Bitcoin continues to remain stuck in sideways momentum, other top markets like Ethereum and XRP will not see too much action either. In fact, it seems XRP is maintaining a status quo right now, which is always interesting to keep an eye on. While there is no reason to expect anything different right now, this market is perhaps the least reliant on Bitcoin these days. The damage over the past 24 hours is minimal and can almost be ignored. The XRP price lost 0.6% in USD value and 0.33% in BTC value. As such, one XRP is priced at $0.3122 or 8.124 Satoshi. Both of these values have been in play for several days now, and it seems nothing will change in the coming hours either. Despite the lack of price excitement, the XRP community remains confident things will pick up steam eventually. Captain XRP envisions a price target of $3 and more, which would require the current market cap to increase by factor 10. Not unlikely, but not necessarily something that will happen just because someone on the internet says so For those users who expected a lack of arbitrage opportunities due to this XRP status quo, there are a few options available. First of all, there is the triangular option with a potential profit of up to 54%. It involves using HitBTC, Kraken, and WazirX. This latter exchange is not known for its trading liquidity and may very well be unavailable to people in specific regions. For traders who prefer to use more traditional arbitrage options, there are a few options as well. Both Coinbase and Bitstamp maintain lower XRP prices compared to CEX and Bitfinex, which makes for some nice profits of up to 2% per trade. There is always money to be made with either cryptocurrency, token, or asset, assuming one is willing to put in some minor effort in the process. When everything is said and done, it seems likely to expect more of the same sideways momentum this evening and tomorrow morning. The fact that XRP got added on Coinbase and failed to pump only further confirms this development is not generating the buzz some traders had expected. Perhaps it has something to do with the delay on Coinbase\u2019s part, although that may only be part of the story. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/ethereum-price-loses-5-yet-traders-continue-to-accumulate/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Ethereum Price Loses 5% yet Traders Continue to Accumulate", "content": "A lot of things happen in the cryptocurrency world every single week. Most of those developments gain some form of traction, whereas most traders and speculators tend to ignore everything else. In the case of Ethereum, its hard fork seemingly went off without a hitch. However, it has not affected the Ethereum price in a positive manner, as a drop to $125 looms ahead. When Bitcoin loses value out of the blue, the other markets will mimic that momentum for at least a few hours. Even the giants like Ethereum will lose value simply because Bitcoin is slipping. This has been a very awkward and annoying correlation between all currencies, although it seems unlikely any major changes should be expected in the near future. Even today, it seems the bearish momentum will dominate all markets with relative ease. Just by looking at the current Ethereum price, one can see things are not heading in the right direction. A 5% drop in USD value is not the best way to start off a new week. Because of this drop to $128.39, it is very likely to assume ETH will reach $125 later today. There is also a 2.6% loss in ETH/BTC, driving this ratio down to 0.03411 BTC. Losing ground in USD value and to Bitcoin at the same time is often a recipe for short-term volatility. As has been the case for a few weeks now, these markets do not suffer from a decrease in overall trading volume when the momentum sours. That in itself has always been interesting to keep an eye on. Even where ETH is concerned, its volume sits at $3.7bn and shows no real signs of slowing down. Unfortunately, it seems the majority of traders right now want to sell ETH rather than buying it. The big news involving Ethereum last week is how the project successfully pulled off its Constantinople hard fork. After hitting some snags on the testnet earlier, it seems all of the kinks have been worked out in the process. While some people expected the fork to drive the price higher, that hasn\u2019t materialized as of yet. Even so, a protocol upgrade hardly ever triggers a price change when it goes live. A lot of traders are seemingly looking at this ETH price drop as an opportunity to accumulate more Ether. Cost-averaging down one\u2019s portfolio is a good way to ensure profits can materialize later on. With Ethereum, these drops have become a bit more frequent as of late, as breaking through the $140 resistance in a decisive manner has proven rather difficult. It is the fourth time in a row the value dips pretty sharply after some promising upward momentum. While some people may see the current price fluctuation as a reason to get worried, it seems unlikely any real harm will be done in the coming hours and days. A sudden price drop is never fun to look at, but there is nothing one can do about it as of right now. As long as Bitcoin doesn\u2019t drop off a cliff, most of the alternative markets should be able to minimize their losses first and foremost. Ethereum is usually rather resilient, although one never knows how this round may play out. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Bitcoin seems to be recovering slightly, yet the top markets remain under a lot of pressure. The Stellar price is trying to move up swiftly, although the going will not be without hurdles. A push to $0.09 should not pose that many problems today. When Bitcoin remains stuck in sideways trading momentum for an extended period of time, one has to wonder how the alternative markets will respond. As is usually the case, these markets tend to follow Bitcoin\u2019s pattern almost to a fault. Stellar is no exception, although its current bullish signs offer a welcome reprieve for holders and speculators alike. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a 4% Stellar price increase across both its USD and BTC value. This brings the value per XLM back to $0.0877, or 2,281 Satoshi. A push to $0.09 should be more than possible under these market circumstances. However, that will primarily depend on what happens to Bitcoin later today. Mark Johnson seems to have faith in Stellar Lumens at this time. At the same time, this rise from $0.083 to $0.087 has been very quick, which means there should be some sort of a retrace in the next few hours or days. Even so, it also shows this push was perhaps coming for some time, yet only materialized today, for some unknown reason. The XLM chart shared by TheCryptoCryBaby shows there may be some interesting back-and-forth momentum in the coming days. While it remains unlikely XLM has bottomed out for 2019, there is also no indication a further drop will materialize in quick succession. Rest assured there will be some exciting and disappointment in the near future. Arbitrage opportunities can often save traders\u2019 portfolios without too many problems. In the case of XLM, there is a very appealing triangular arbitrage option worth exploring. Exploring these options usually requires multiple exchanges, although CEX and Kraken have a solid reputation. BitBns, on the other hand, is unknown to most traders. As is always the case in one of the most volatile financial industries in the world, nothing is ever set in stone. The promising XLM price momentum at this time can easily look very different in the hours and days to come. While XLM has sufficient trading volume to make good things happen, there are plenty of traders who will chase any quick profit and move on to a different market.

That is only to be expected, as most investors are tired of seeing their portfolio bleed value on a regular basis. The Dogecoin price remains rather stable so far, as the $0,002 level has not been broken in a decisive manner. As such, it is also one of the few top 30 coins to note a small gain. Whereas most cryptocurrency users would love to chase a good old pump-and-dump, it seems nearly no market can generate any excitement today. Finding a coin which offers stability instead of volatility is a good alternative in this regard. Unfortunately for traders, choices are very limited in this regard as well. It seems Dogecoin checks most of the right boxes, primarily because it always generates some decent trading liquidity. Over the past 24 hours, there hasn\u2019t been any significant Dogecoin price change. While there is a 0.8% gain in both USD and BTC value, it doesn\u2019t amount to all that much when looking t the bigger picture. One DOGE is still valued at $0.002014, or 52 Satoshi, like it was a few days ago. As such, it seems this level will act as the new support moving forward, assuming no major retrace occurs. When the weekend comes around, there usually isn\u2019t too much trading volume to take note of. In the case of Dogecoin, that situation is no different, although there is no reason to panic either With $15.48m in volume, it would appear there is still plenty of interest to buy, sell, and trade Dogecoin on a Sunday. Whether or not the volume will be sufficient to keep this uptrend in place, has yet to be determined. Even though there was some concern regarding the Dogetheruem bridge not being developed further, it seems the price hasn\u2019t responded in a negative manner. In fact, the dip was bought pretty quickly. It is a bit unclear why Rasedul Hasan decides to share a price chart dating back to August of an unspecified year, but the sentiment still applies up to a certain extent. When it comes to finding memes involving Dogecoin, there is never a dull day whatsoever. Fizz has created an interesting image depicting two dogs in what appears to be a Minecraft setting. While it remains unclear what the exact meaning of this meme is it will undoubtedly lead to some intriguing storylines. The Dogecoin community gets quite creative these days. All things considered, it seems the Dogecoin value will not see any major changes in the coming hours. Even with Bitcoin remaining on the bearish side of the spectrum, the meme currency of the internet continues to do its own thing first and foremost. The big question is whether or not the $0.002 level can turn into support over the coming days and weeks. That may prove to be crucial for the future DOGE price.

That is not entirely uncommon during the weekend, especially when Bitcoin is losing value in quick succession. As far as the EOS price is concerned, the momentum isn\u2019t looking too promising either. It will be interesting to see if the $3.5 level can act as support in the coming hours and days. It should not come as much of a surprise to see all alternative markets under pressure when Bitcoin turns bearish. As is usually the case when things had in this direction the altcoins lose more value than BTC, primarily because the individual ratio to Bitcoin comes under a lot of pressure. EOS is no exception in this regard, which won\u2019t please too many speculators. Over the past 24 hours, the combined damage to the EOS price is quite severe. More specifically, there is the 4.2% decline in USD value, pushing the price down to $3.51. There is also a 3.46% decrease in EOS/BTC, which drives that ratio down to 91,065 Satoshi. So far, nothing irreversible has happened, but the overall trend simply isn\u2019t what most people had hoped for. There appears to be a serious debate going on on social media right now. When it comes to gauging the development of the EOS ecosystem, opinions are all over the place. Rami James expects some major media outlets \u2013 both in crypto and MSM \u2013 to effectively rectify their reports. Whether or not that will happen, is up in the air. An interesting discussion worth keeping an eye on. Collar Crypto always tries to make the best of the current situation. Stating how EOS is undervalued and Ethereum is overvalued, will undoubtedly irk a lot of people. However, there is a case to be made if the user thinks he is in the right. It will be interesting to see how all markets evolve in the coming months. If the bearish momentum were to return in full force, being undervalued or overvalued will not matter that much. The tweet by Crypto and Chile is rather amusing, for many different reasons. Warren Buffet is a very interesting individual in correlation with cryptocurrencies. It seems highly unlikely he would appreciate EOS or anything else in this industry, simply because it is a cryptocurrency. Crypto enthusiasts muse about the strangest things sometimes, but it makes for an interesting read. While most people hope to see some more positive momentum for all markets come tomorrow, it seems rather unlikely that will happen. However, there are several precedents where all markets turned bullish on a Sunday for no apparent reason. That could happen again, although it seems no major bump will materialize for EOS just yet.

Further down the rankings, however, it would appear the Digitex Futures price is trying to reclaim some lost ground. It has been a while since the project made some waves, after all. When Bitcoin is struggling during the weekend, some of the lower ranked altcoins tend to rise in value. Correlations like these make cryptocurrency such an interesting and exciting industry at all times. Additionally, it is important to keep tabs on all alternative markets and not just look at the top 25. While not everyone agrees lower-ranked projects will be successful in the end, Digitex Futures gets people talking every now and then. Over the past few hours, there has been a remarkable Digitex Futures price trend. Following a 6.1% gain in USD value, one DGTX is now priced at $0.0512. There is also a 7% gain in BTC value and a 9.2% increase in DGTX/ETH. All of these signs are very promising, especially when looking at the overall bearish pressure affecting virtually every other market right now. What is somewhat worrisome for this token, however, is how the overall trading volume fails to impress. A project valued at $37.7m should be capable of noting one-third of its market cap in trading volume. In the case of DGTX, the volume sits at just $2.9m, or less than 10% of its market valuation. Not the statistic people are looking for, although it might not have much of an impact in the long run, The big news of this week is how the Digitex Treasury Token sale has begun. This also coincides with the announcement of launching the Digitex Futures Exchange, which will go live on April 30th. Many people have high expectations regarding this new platform, although it remains to be seen if the developers can deliver. Launching a new exchange will always attract some attention. Theo Constantinides is quite happy with the way Digitex Futures is performing as of late. He expects the exchange launch to effectively create a massive demand for DGTX in the weeks to come. It also appears the platform will allow users to trade without fees, which is something everyone can appreciate. Although the current price swing tends to favor DGTX, this momentum can evaporate in very quick succession and when people least expect it. It is never worth it to chase a pump or a market rising in value. Some excitement will materialize regarding the Digitex Futures Exchange, but that is rather common when it comes to announcements in this industry. The actual product release, on the other hand, tends to trigger a sell-off more often than not. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While fewer markets are in the red at this time, there is still a lot of unease to contend with. As far as the top markets are concerned, nothing is moving in a decisive manner. However, it seems the Basic Attention Token price is losing ground again after an unexpected bullish run yesterday. It has been a pretty interesting week for Basic Attention Token, at least in the price department. Following some new developments and partnerships, it appears the interest in this token is moving up again nicely. However, most of that positive momentum which materialized yesterday has all but disappeared today. The result is a decline in price, which was entirely to be expected. More specifically, the Basic Attention Token price has decreased by just over 5% across the board. Not entirely surprising, as there was a very strong uptrend just yesterday. It is only normal traders start taking profits when the momentum works in their favor. Especially with BAT, one has to take profits quickly, as the momentum can easily sour where this token is concerned. For now, one BAT is valued at $0.1768, or 4,588 Satoshi. As is always the case in the crypto industry, the overall trading volume tends to take a serious hit on Sundays. For BAT, the volume sits at just $21.74m, which is a lot lower compared to yesterday when the price was getting pumped. As such, it seems likely to assume the price decline will continue for a few more hours to come, unless something changes out of the blue. What is rather peculiar is how traders shared an interesting chart yesterday. TQ Crypto confirms Basic Attention Token successfully broke above the 200-day moving average for the first time since November of 2018. To most people, that seems like a major bull flag, yet the market has capitulated as a result. This creates a lot of short-term uncertainty, although no massive losses are to be expected at this time. For those traders who want to make money but remain hesitant about trusting Basic Attention Token\u2019s momentum, exploring arbitrage opportunities is always a viable alternative. Today, BAT is seemingly a part of a triangular arbitrage opportunity which involves Litecoin as well. The exchanges involved are Binance, Kraken, and Koinex, which means overall liquidity should not pose too many problems. Although this new BAT price decline will make some traders anxious, it was to be expected this market would not remain bullish for very long. The overall market circumstances do not favor a strong uptrend as of right now, although Bitcoin has begun showing minor signs of recovery. This will not be the last time the value of Basic Attention Token rises, but it seems the $0.176 level will need to begin acting as support first.

So far, nothing of the sorts is even close to happening where the top markets are concerned. Further down the rankings, all eyes are seemingly on the Ravencoin price. This altcoin tends to perform extremely well when other markets are under severe pressure. When Bitcoin runs out of steam \u2013 like it has been doing rather regularly since November 2017 \u2013 it is normal for all other markets to bleed value as well, However, not all altcoins follow Bitcoin\u2019s trend, either for better or worse. Ravencoin has been one of the notable exceptions in this regard, as it successfully breaks out under overwhelming bearish conditions. In the past few hours, the Ravencoin price increased by nearly 29% in both USD and BTC value. Because of this unexpected surge, one RVN is now valued at $0.0194, or 505 Satoshi. Both levels will be pleasing on the eye for traders and speculators alike. The overall trading volume is also looking very healthy, which might help keep this surge alive for a little while. There are some interesting developments behind the scenes which are worth nothing. It appears Ravencoin has obtained a USD fiat gateway on the Vertbase platform. That in itself is a remarkable development which has seemingly gone by unnoticed. It is difficult for small-cap altcoins to get a USD pairing these days, yet it seems Ravencoin can cross that hurdle off its list. HakanAykanat4 is one of those altcoin speculators who is in it for making as much money as possible in this industry. His target of 759 Satoshi is still in play right now, although there is some resistance forming as of right now. Even so, considering how the price was 296 Satoshi a few days ago, this trend is quite remarkable. Crypto Buddha is hoping for the starts and the moon right now. While no one can blame trader for getting a bit enthusiastic, it seems unlikely Ravencoin will hit $1 in the near future. At the same time, a very bullish Bitcoin surge can push the value of all altcoins up in the process. A fifty-fold increase in value would be required for Ravencoin to hit $1, which will not occur overnight by any means. While all other markets are clearly struggling for traction, Ravencoin is simply soaring. How much of this has to do with the Vertbase listing, will always be up to interpretation. It is good to see at least one market move along swiftly at this time, although chasing the pump is never an advisable course of action in this volatile industry.

Bitcoin has dipped in the red again, which usually doesn\u2019t bode well for the alternative markets. On days when the XRP price loses over 2% for no good reason, there simply won\u2019t be too much to be excited about. This week had a lot of interesting news for cryptocurrencies, tokens, and digital assets alike. When Coinbase confirmed they were adding XRP to both the Pro and regular platform, people expected a major bull run to materialize. As has been the case for other currencies getting listed on the exchange, no real uptrend materialized for XRP in the end. In fact, the hype has evaporated almost completely. As a result, there is a very notable XRP price decrease throughout the day. With a 2.4% setback in USD value, one XRP is now priced at $0.3146. There\u2019s also the 1.9% decline in XRP/BTC, driving the value below 8,200 Satoshi once again. Neither of these trends is too worrisome right now, but it appears there will not necessarily be a recourse later today. Even though the market itself shows no interest in moving up. the XRP community continues to try and make things happen. Neptune XRP wouldn\u2019t mind seeing more people drop Bitcoin donations and switch over to XRP instead. From an environmentally-friendly perspective, XRP would make a lot of sense. However, Bitcoin\u2019s impact on the environment has also been severely exaggerated in recent years. Some other users are seemingly flocking to XRP because it is the more stable currency on the market today. While it would make sense for some people to convert their fiat currency into something like XRP, it is not necessarily the best idea to put all of one\u2019s eggs in the same bucket. For those users who are desperate to make some profit with XRP regardless of the current market trend, arbitrage opportunities are always worth looking into. As far as XRP is concerned, there are a few interesting and potentially lucrative options to look into today. With potential profits of up to 2%, these traders can help a lot of trader negative the asset\u2019s net losses. As long as Bitcoin does not find new stable ground, no one should expect alternative markets to offer something different. For XRP, the reliance on Bitcoin has become less apparent, except during times like these. When the momentum sours, no currency will escape the grasp of Bitcoin dragging everything else down with it.

As long as Bitcoin remains at a status quo, altcoins could either gain or lose significant value. The Holo price, after facing a rough patch, is seemingly moving in the right direction again. While the gains are looking solid, there is a lot of bearish pressure as well. While Bitcoin remains in its current uneasy situation, one would expect altcoins to attempt mounting a comeback. Most of them are seemingly incapable of doing so at this time, although some markets try to push the pace. Holo is one of those markets which usually tends to buck the trend, although it has come under a lot of pressure in recent weeks. As such, traders were not too happy with this momentum, although it seems things are turning around. In the past few hours, there has been a remarkable turn of events where Holo is concerned. More specifically, the Holo price has risen by 5% in both USD and BTC value. There is also a 6.3% increase in ETH value. Because of these gains, one HOT is now valued at $0.001166, or 30 Satoshi. Especially this latter aspect is of great interest to traders, as it seemed such a value would not be reached for some time. As was to be expected, this current momentum has triggered a lot of excitement on social media. H_O_L_O_Dude, for example, is about ready to start performing a moonwalk based on the current momentum. While the gain is worth paying attention to, it is not necessarily backed by sufficient trading volume or enthusiasm. It is possible the high for the day has been reached already. Eren Diler, who is also keeping a close eye on the Holo chart right now, expects a push to 32 Satoshi later today. While some traders expected 36 Satoshi to be the high for the day, that seems rather unlikely at this time. Even so, there is nothing too get overly excited about as of right now, as a minor 5% jump should not be all that surprising after the most recent downtrend. While those price targets may seem somewhat realistic to a lot of people, there will always be individuals who expect bigger and better things. Ken Lin, for example, thinks it is still likely there will be a push to 40 Satoshi over the coming weeks. Not impossible by any means, although the current momentum simply doesn\u2019t warrant a massive surge as of yet. While most Holo speculators will be quite pleased with how things are going, it is evident this may very well be the high for this weekend. Until Bitcoin turns on the pumps again, it seems unlikely one should expect a major development for HOT. One never knows how these markets will evolve, though, as cryptocurrencies are volatile and mysterious. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

One particular market successfully bucking the trend is Litecoin. This popular altcoin is slowly turning bullish, which can be seen from its current short-term Litecoin price increase. While it is unclear if that momentum will remain in place for very long, it is a welcome sight regardless. While Bitcoin itself is still trying to find its next support level to regain some lost value, other markets are not as patient whatsoever. That is a good sign, although it could also lead to some setbacks while trying to jump the gun. For Litecoin, things are looking relatively good right now, although there is still a long way to go prior to making this an official uptrend. In the past few hours, the Litecoin price has risen by 2.6% in both USD and BTC value. It is pertinent for alternative markets to gain on Bitcoin as of right now, as that will help offset any USD losses triggered by the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency. For now, Litecoin has climbed above $47 again, although the push to $50 may not necessarily happen today. It is an interesting trend ahead of the weekend, though. Litecoin enthusiasts on social media are trying to convey an important message these days. Blue Oyster is confident Litecoin is not designed to make anyone rich, which is a bit of an odd sentiment at this time. However, it is a currency which can provide financial freedom to all users, which is something that applies to Bitcoin and other top markets as well. Even so, it is good to keep one\u2019s expectations in line with what may be achievable, rather than hoping for something which may never materialize. When looking at the actual chart, however, it is evident there is not necessarily too much to be excited about right now. As there is more sell volume shaping up, combined with slowly weakening buy orders, there is a chance this uptrend will not remain in place all that long. However, one never knows how things will evolve in these markets, as cryptocurrencies remain unpredictable and volatile at all times. Tone Vays, while well-known in the cryptocurrency world, is not too happy with the Litecoin Foundation. He highlights how some of the previous collaborations with other projects have \u201cscam\u201d written all over them. Even so, it has not reflected badly on Litecoin itself, and all of those collaborations are seemingly in the past as well. While it is true Litecoin still has a lot of overall trading volume, there will be a lot of resistance between the current price level and $50. That doesn\u2019t mean there will be an automatic correction either, although no one should expect any miracles from Litecoin at this time.

All markets are affected by this uneasy momentum every single day. So far, it seems the XRP price is no exception, even though it is trying to move toward $0.32 again. The recent listing on Coinbase and Coinbase Pro could spark some excitement. It has been an interesting week for the cryptocurrency, token, and digital asset markets alike. While Bitcoin is still at a status quo, for the time being, it would appear the other markets are trying to make their mark for better or worse. XRP, while always a rather popular asset, is trying to make something happen in the coming hours and days. Slow and steady will often yield the best results in the long run. To put this in perspective, the past few hours have resulted in a 1.85% gain in USD value and a 2.06% gain in BTC value. Because of these gains, the XRP price has risen to $0.319851 or 8,291 Satoshi. XRP Holders will be pleased with that BTC-oriented uptrend, as it appeared the asset would drop below 8,100 Satoshi earlier in the week. A push to $0.32 is very feasible right now, but that may be the limit for the coming hours. After getting added to Coinbase Pro earlier in the week, it now seems XRP is also listed on the regular Coinbase platform, as well as the mobile applications. This is a bit of a surprise announcement, although it was only a matter of time until this situation came to be. Surprisingly, the news seems to generate far less excitement than the hype ever did. What is rather remarkable is how there appears to be an increasing demand for XRP, at least according to the Fiat Leak website. This website is usually monitored tot rack Bitcoin purchases around the world, but it seems the XRP side of things is also worth keeping an eye on over the coming days. With up to 2.5 million XRP being bought and sold every minute, things are seemingly heating up. For those who take a closer look at the actual price chart, however, it quickly becomes apparent not much has changed. In fact, the price seems prepared for a major liftoff, but it might take a while until it becomes visible in a convincing manner. The Coinbase listing can effectively make some things happen, although it seems the company waited so long very few people get excited over it. For the time being, this Friday is showing some early signs of potential promise. While it is not materializing in terms of massive gains all of a sudden, it is interesting to see Bitcoin moving up fractionally as well. As long as that situation remains in place, interesting things can happen over the weekend. What that means exactly for XRP, is a different matter altogether.

For fans of Litecoin, the current momentum is very promising first and foremost. Following some strong gains, the Litecoin price is on its way to reach $49 again. A surprising turn of events, although one that will spark some interesting debates. This year could be rather interesting for all cryptocurrencies, tokens, and digital assets on the market. While Bitcoin is still seemingly stuck in the dirt, some other altcoins are trying to make their mark. One of those coins is Litecoin, a currency which is often overlooked by most traders and speculators. It has been a good start to 2019 for LTC, primarily because the gains continue to pile up when the momentum shifts. To put this in perspective, the Litecoin price has risen by over 3% in both USD and BTC value alike. This push brings the price to $48.82 or 0.01268 BTC. Compared to some other currencies on the market, it would appear Litecoin is checking a lot of the right boxes for traders. Combined with $1.238bn in trading volume, there is no indication this trend will not remain in place for a while. On social media, it seems there is some positivity brewing as well. Thepoorholder is confident Litecoin is getting ready to enter a mega bullish phase. After all, the current chart seems to indicate there are some very interesting similarities with the November 2017 trend. While that could be seen as a potential market indicator, history doesn\u2019t always repeat itself where LTC is concerned. Eire-Litecoin, on the other hand, is looking at a slightly bigger picture first and foremost. When the next bull market comes around \u2013 which will happen eventually \u2013 there is a chance Litecoin will play a role of importance. While it remains to be seen how all of this will pan out exactly, the current momentum seems to favor this altcoin at this time. For those who want to take a much closer look at the actual LTC price chart, it quickly becomes apparent the $46 level is currently acting as support. That is not necessarily what people had expected to see at this time, but it appears this situation may remain in place for some time. Assuming buyers continue to stack orders, things could get very interesting. All things considered, the majority of crypto markets seem to be in a good place right now. While Litecoin is moving up a lot quicker than all of its \u201cmarket cap competitors\u201d, it is not necessarily noting monster gains either by any means.

Although Binance Coin trumps all of its competitors by miles, the Huobi Token price is seeing its own bull run right now. With a current value of $1.31, it seems a lengthy period of sideways trading is finally coming to an end. In the cryptocurrency exchange world, Huobi seemingly gets overlooked rather often, for some unknown reason. The platform provides access to many different markets for trading, yet it appears the exchange simply can\u2019t meet the overall trading volume of its major competitors. That in itself is an interesting situation, although the Huobi Token is not necessarily feeling any negative effects in the process. While the Huobi Token price hasn\u2019t budged much in 2019, today is shaping up to a very interesting day. Not only is there a 10% gain in USD value, but also in BTC value. Additionally, HT gains 11.25% on Ethereum, which is equally impressive. All of these gains push the HT price back to $1.31, 33,885 Satoshi, or 0.00957 Ether. All levels appear to be quite solid at this time, assuming there is a genuine interest by traders to support these levels. To support such a strong and sudden uptrend, Huobi Token will need enough trading volume. So far, it seems that is not too big of a problem. With $27.6m in trades, nearly half of its market cap valuation in value has changed hands. That seems to confirm the interest in HT is very real right now, although that situation may come to change as the weekend comes around. While most of the HT trading action comes from the Huobi Global platform itself, LBank is also contributing nicely with its HT/USDT pair. For now, it seems the USDT pairs are dictating the pace for this token, with BTC and ETH pairs taking a bit of a backseat. That seems to be a very promising development at this time, primarily because USDT trading is less speculative in nature compared to ETH or BTC trading, at least for these types or tokens. It is rather remarkable to note how Huobi Token has successfully reached a 30-day high at this time. With most top markets still in a bit of a slump, reaching 30-day highs seems nigh impossible for Bitcoin and consorts. However, markets like HT continue to follow their own path first and foremost. It makes for some interesting trading in this volatile industry. All things considered, this appears to be a very strong HT price push. With sufficient trading volume, it might even be extended for a few more hours, although noting further gains will be quite problematic. It will be interesting to see if any of the other exchange tokens see a similar trend later today or over the course of the weekend.

With Bitcoin on the precipice of losing even more value, the alternative markets are struggling to stay afloat. Most losses are kept to a minimum, yet it appears the Electroneum price remains under a lot of downward pressure. It is rather apparent the good news affecting individual crypto markets will not necessarily result in promising price momentum. Although the Electroneum team released its M1 smartphone, the market has not responded in kind whatsoever. Instead, it seems the value of ETN continues to dwindle, as it has now dropped below $0.007 once again. To put this in perspective, the past 24 hours have not been kind to Electroneum in the slightest. In fact, it would appear there has been a 5.7% retrace in USD value and a 5.4% dip in BTC value. Because of this negative trend, the value per ETN is brought down to $0.006794 or 176 Satoshi. It is very different from ETN hitting $0.008 not that long ago, yet it seems that level will remain unattainable for quite some time to come. As has been the case for some time now, there are some interesting rumors being distributed on social media. Some people claim Electroneum could receive support on the Ledger Nano hardware wallet line soon. While that is anything but impossible at this time, one has to keep in mind something like this will be communicated by the company in due time. So far, they have not done anything of the sorts. What is happening in reality, however, is how Chris Gorman has attended his first GSMA Intelligence advisory board meeting this week. Considering how Electroneum is now represented as part of this \u201cexclusive group\u201d, it will be interesting to see how this affects the altcoin itself. It is still a very major development, even if it might not impact the price in the slightest. An intriguing observation is provided by Mr. CryptoCZ, who seemingly confirms the mobile Electroneum app is doing quite well in Slovenia. What is even more interesting is how the app is seemingly not far behind Revolut and Coinbase in this regard, further confirming Eastern Europe starts to see merit in this project. Everyone likes to earn some free money, after all. While everything seems to be heading in the right direction for Electroneum behind the scenes, the same cannot be said for its current price. That is partially because Bitcoin is still losing value right now, but also because there is a seeming disinterest in crypto again all of a sudden.

Fetch.AI recently completed its token sale through Binance\u2019s Launchpad platform. It was such a big success, the sale was over in about 15 seconds. As is usually the case, this surprising success attracts some dismay and leaves a lot of people frustrated. Given the success of Initial Coin Offerings in the past, and the subsequent growing disinterest, the Fetch.AI token sale was never a guaranteed success. Although the project has generated some buzz, that is never a guarantee for attracting investors. By officially partnering with Binance\u2019s Launchpad to organize this sale, however, the team managed to attract more than sufficient people willing to give them money to build their infrastructure. Organizing such a token sale on a dedicated platform owned by the largest crypto exchange in the world is a smart move. This exposed the Fetch.AI sale to millions of users from all over the world. For an artificial intelligence and digital economics company, raising sufficient capital is pertinent to ensure their vision can be turned into a working product. The token is now also trading on the Binance exchange already, which can put some people who missed out on the sale in a good position to acquire tokens after all. As was to be expected from this quick listing, some early investors attempted to crash the market in quick succession. The value dipped a slow as 0.000071111 BTC in the early hours of trading. At the time of writing, that value has seemingly stabilized near the 0.001 mark, for the time being. With nearly 12,000 Bitcoin in trading volume already, it seems logical this market will remain volatile for quite some time to come. Especially given the overarching bearish trend affecting the entire crypto industry right now. Although everything seems to have gone well for Fetch.Ai, the crypto community seemingly has a very different opinion. Since very few people were able to buy into the tokens ale, there is a lot of frustration and dismay. Some people claim there was a \u201crigged CAPTCHA field\u201d, which prevented most people from even partaking. It is evident this quick campaign, combined with some technical issues for some, puts the entire ordeal in an awkward spotlight. There are quite a few people frustrated over the way token sales on Launchpad are organized. As buy requests are placed in a queue, it is a free-for-all scramble to get something out of it. While it is unclear if anything can be done about this situation to improve upon Launchpad token sales in the future, the overall dismay may not necessarily quiet down soon either. It is only the second token sale on this platform so far, but seemingly the second which is subjected to some controversy. For all the people who are calling this token sale a scam, it seems there is nothing wrong with the way Binance is organizing these offerings. While the end result may not be to everyone\u2019s liking, the project has received the necessary funding and the token can be bought and sold on the exchange a few days later. At the current price of $0.37, being able to buy in at $0.08 was very appealing, but that doesn\u2019t mean there will be no further room for profits.

The Revain price, while usually performing well during these uncertain times, is bleeding value all over the place once again. In the world of altcoins, there is a lot of odd momentum taking place right now. While there is no real reason for any downtrend in the cryptocurrency industry as a whole at this time, it quickly becomes evident things are not looking too great when looking at the bigger picture. When even currencies such as Revain are facing a lot of pressure in quick succession, today may not yield any positive outcome after all. Over the past 24 hours, the market has seemingly turned against Revain in many different ways. More specifically, there is a 6.9% decline in USD value, dropping the value down to $0.11873. There is also a 6.7% loss in Bitcoin value and a 5.6% loss over Ethereum. None of these trends warrant optimism, as it may only be the beginning of what is yet to come later today. One thing that has always been a bit odd about Revain is its trading volume. Unlike other altcoins, Revain seems to be continually struggling for trading volume. Even today, it notes just $422.569 in trades, which is next to nothing for a project valued at over $57.5m. This altcoin is not of great interest to most traders, even though it has allowed them to make good money during times like these in the past. As most of this trading volume comes from exchanges which most people do not even use at this time, it seems unlikely there will be any recourse moving forward. BTC-Alpha and BitForex remain the biggest contributors for Revain as of right now, although it is a bit unclear how all of this will evolve in the near future. Getting listed on bigger exchanges has become easier lately, yet with so many projects vying for attention, Revain is not making itself stand out enough, by the look of things. It is also worth noting the Revain sentiment is not necessarily surprising at this time. Not just because Bitcoin remains in the dirt, but also because the currency had hit a 30-day low a few days ago, That low is now being improved upon, although it is not necessarily a good development for people holding R as part of their portfolio. All signs point toward further bearish pressure for Revain. This is not the development people are looking for right now, although there isn\u2019t much one can do about the overall industry trend on their own. As such, today will be an interesting day, regardless of the outcome. For Revain, it seems highly unlikely this will be the bottom at this time, although one never knows what may come next.

While this applies to virtually all other markets, it appears the EOS price is trying to buck this overall trend, and is even mildly successful at doing so as well. Everything needs to be taken into account when minor uptrends like these materialize. It hasn\u2019t been the easiest week for EOS so far. Following the news regarding $7.7m worth of EOS being stolen in quick succession, there has been some community backlash in general. That is only to be expected, although it does not necessarily mean there is a major problem that can\u2019t be rectified either. For now, however, it seems the market is trying to shift into bullish gear, albeit it will not be an easy feat. To put this in perspective, the EOS price has noted a 1.2% gain in both USD and BTC value in the past few hours. A remarkable development, especially when considering how Bitcoin is still down by roughly 0.15%. With the current price sitting at $3.57, or 92,421 Satoshi, things are not looking all that bad either. With the trading volume not dipping all that much either, there is a chance this trend can be sustained for a while. Every day offers some interesting insights on social media which most people would not necessarily expect. More specifically, the Center for Information and Industry Development in China ranks EOS as the top public blockchain. It is followed by Tron and Ethereum. While some people may debate that second and third place, it seems EOS has its ducks in a row quite well at this time. There is also an active Twitter poll going on courtesy of Bitmama. This crypto trading platform would like to add at least one new currency to its platform in the future. With users being able to choose between EOS, Tron, and Steem, it seems EOS is quickly gaining support, whereas nearly no one seems to vote in favor of TRX. That result will undoubtedly shift around a bit until the vote closes tomorrow morning. With the security debacle still sparking debates, Corey Miller shares a rather interesting observation. He claims just 10% of top BPs are running a full node due to the growing block size. However, EOS new York already countered that statement and shows things are not as bleak as they may seem at first. A very interesting topic worth keeping an eye on in the future. For the time being, it is anyone\u2019s guess as to how and when the crypto markets will move in the coming hours. As the weekend draws near, some erratic movements can be expected. As far as EOS is concerned, sustaining this upward momentum will not be easy in the slightest. However, it seems pushing down the value will also be a challenge, thus a status quo seems to be the most logical outcome. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Despite promising signs this morning, most markets have dropped in the red ever so slightly. Even the Holo price is facing a rather big decline, which seems to indicate the next leg up for this token may not necessarily occur right away. It is not entirely uncommon for altcoins to go deeper in the red than Bitcoin itself. In fact, this is a rather common development in the past three to four years When those altcoins not only lose USD value, also BTC and/or ETH value, things are not looking all that great. For Holo, it is evident the coming hours will be crucial in terms of determining the overall trend ahead of the weekend. To be more specific, the Holo price has declined by over 4% across the board. Because of this negative pressure, the value is driven down to $0.001114 USD, or 29 Satoshi, or 813 Etheroshi. While this setback is not too significant by any means, the overall trading volume will not be sufficient to turn the ship around. This also means HOT will not reach 40 Satoshi again in the coming days. As is always the case where social media is concerned, there is no shortage of interesting information out there. HoloIslandNews shared a YouTube video explaining how Hlochain\u2019s benchmark scenarios could unfold. It is a very informative video for fans of the ecosystem, although it might not necessarily get too many non-holders excited right away. Even so, bringing more positive attention to Holo is never a wasted effort. There is also some information being spread about Holochain and Holo the token. It is evident Dr. Holo is explaining the difference in a concise manner, as it is important to distinguish between the two. This is similar to how people confuse XRP and Ripple, even though they are two completely different entities as well. Based on the current market conditions, it seems unlikely Holo will see much of an upward trend in the coming hours and days. As the price has already briefly dipped one of the key support levels, it is evident this may not necessarily be the last time something like this occurs. If the downtrend continues, things can get very ugly in rather quick succession. All things considered, it would appear things will not necessarily improve all that much for Holo. That is rather unfortunate for the people who bought this altcoin at a higher value, although they should know the risk of chasing pumps quite well by now. Until Bitcoin recovers in a significant manner, no alternative market will note much of an uptrend. Unfortunately, it seems Bitcoin may not necessarily begin forming a new leg up this week.

As the value of Bitcoin and all altcoins, tokens, and assets is still incredibly low compared to the 2017 levels, some providers will have to close up shop. The latest one to announce such a turn of events is CoinHive. The popular crypto mining solution provider will suspend its services come March 8th. Most people will not remember CoinHive fondly. Not because the service provided is terrible by any means, as it offers a genuine alternative to the traditional ad-driven business model for content providers. However, their mining scripts have gotten a very bad reputation due to the rise of cryptojacking malware in 2018. Most of those tools all seemed to rely on CoinHive mining scripts in one way or another. Combined with the declining price of Monero \u2013 or XMR \u2013 it seems CoinHive has gotten itself into a very awkward position as of right now. The falling XMR price has caused a lot of problems for investors and traders as well. However, it seems to be slow to recover as of right now, which puts even more strain on companies such as CoinHive. That is not the only reason why the company is calling it quits, though. CoinHive also noted a massive decrease in overall Monero hashrate. This is primarily due to the most recent hard fork introduced by the developers, it seems the overall Monero mining effort has taken a bit of a blow. There will be another hard fork on March 9, which will also introduce an update of the mining algorithm itself. Because of that change, CoinHive seemingly comes at risk of becoming obsolete altogether. As such, the service will be discontinued, and all mining scripts in existence will cease to function in their entirety. Dashboards will remain accessible until the end of April 2019, which will let users withdraw funds until that point. It is unclear what will happen with unclaimed payouts afterward, although this warning is issued well in advance. The main thing to keep an eye out for is how the shutdown of CoinHive will affect the cryptojacking efforts globally. Since most of these malware strains rely on CoinHive scripts, it seems logical to assume earnings generated by criminals will face a major setback as well. That doesn\u2019t mean they will not be able to come up with new solutions, by any means, yet it may trigger a positive shift in the long run. While it will be sad to see CoinHive disappear, it is evident the cryptocurrency industry is not in the best of states right now. As long as this rather bearish market trend continues, there will be further casualties eventually. At the same time, this development can provide an opportunity for other companies to stake their claim. This industry is constantly evolving behind the scenes, after all.", "date": "2019-02-28T09:05:02+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 28}

This primarily stems forth from Bitcoin\u2019s indecisive attitude as of right now. While the IOTA price is still in the green as of right now, it remains unclear if that will be the case in just a few hours from now. It has been a while since people last discussed iOTA in such a manner which would warrant any bullish price momentum. So far, that situation has not changed in the slightest. Although the project is currently being developed as of right now, there has not been too much excitement by the look of things. Even so, the price is still holding on by a straw, which offers some potential future promise. In the past 24 hours, the IOTA price has gained 1.4% in SUD a value and 1.34% in BTC value. Because of this most recent rise, the IOTA value has risen to $0.28627, or 7,541 Satoshi. While this price development seems promising, it quickly becomes apparent IOTA still struggles in terms of trading volume. Just $8.14m in trades is not necessarily all that great for a project valued at nearly $800m. Behind the scenes of IOTA, there are still some very promising developments to take note of. First of all, the Iota Reactor Connector has been open sourced, which can lead to some very peculiar developments over the coming months. With the code now open source, the team will work on providing tutorials and documentation to let other developers experiment with this technology. There is also some excitement regarding the IOTA Data Marketplace, which seems to welcome new partners nearly every month. Although things have changed a bit compared to the initial proof of concept, the code has now been open sourced. As such, all of the data marketplace features can be decentralized properly, with the help of the IOTA community. Another positive development, although one that may not necessarily influence the price all that much. For those traders and enthusiasts who are mainly interested in the current chart, it seems as if IOTA is approaching the bottom of a triangle right now. While there is a chance that level will not act as support for very long, it could also serve as a platform for a price bounce in the near future. The coming hours will prove to be pretty crucial in this regard As is always the case in the cryptocurrency world, no one ever knows what will come next. While the IOTA momentum doesn\u2019t look too promising at this stage, that can change of Bitcoin were to turn a bit bullish again in the very near future. Although that seems rather unlikely, all of the developments taking place behind the scenes can work in IOTA\u2019s favor in the long run. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

As such, Ethereum Classic becomes one of the go-to markets, since it tends to rise in value quite regularly. Even today, the Ethereum Classic price is moving up slightly faster than a few others. While it might not reach $4.5 today, the momentum is still promising. All of the cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets rely on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum first and foremost. While that can be quite problematic in many different ways, it would also appear that works in favor of most markets when the overall momentum turns bullish. Today is another example in this regard, as all of the top 20 markets are in the green simply because Bitcoin began moving up once again. As far as the Ethereum Classic price is concerned, things are looking somewhat promising as of right now. With a 2.7% gain in USD value and a 2.1% increase in BTC value, the momentum has turned bullish once again. Because of these gains, ETC is valued at $4.41 again, or 0.0011 BTC. A further push may prove challenging, as the overall trend is still on wobbly legs as of right now. As is usually the case where cryptocurrencies are concerned, everything stands or falls with trading volume. Ethereum Classic seemingly has no real problems in that regard, as the trading volume sits at $173.123m. That is over one-third of ETC\u2019s market cap, which should be sufficient to ensure no wild price swings in either direction can occur on short notice. As long as that situation remains unchanged, there should not be any further bearish pressure in the coming hours. On social media, there are a few interesting discussions regarding Ethereum Classic at this time. Land Wolf, for example, would love to see COinbase introduce a payment option which would support ETC. While that is not impossible by any means, it seems unlikely things will effectively head in such a direction. There is also some dismay regarding how Dash is being used for payments, even though this user feels ETC is clearly the better option. There is also an interesting development to bring ETC to the Ethereum ecosystem in a wrapped version. This concept is not entirely new by any means, as the concept has been tested before with wrapped Bitcoin, among other projects. While one can wonder why there is a need to bring ETC to ETH, it is still a remarkable development which can benefit the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. As is usually the case, Ethereum Classic has been somewhat of an oddball in the cryptocurrency world. Any developments involving ETC usually do not impact the price, yet speculation tends to do the job just fine. Since today has one piece of news in both categories, it will be interesting to see what happens to the ETC price in the coming hours. No real changes should be expected for now.

The respondents consider blockchain as a revolutionary technology that is capable to improve business processes and the economy as a whole. Does that mean that the year of 2019 will become a turning point in the blockchain development? A number of large companies have already applied cutting-edge technologies and shared their plans to continue putting blockchain solutions into practice. For example, a global tech-giant IBM has recently launched the IBM Food Trust blockchain platform to help retailers track the supplies of chicken, eggs, and tomatoes. According to the firm\u2019s plans, this platform will cover all fresh products by 2020. IBM Food Trust will allow retail chains to check the origin and safety of goods. The French retailer Carrefour has already joined the platform. The company will monitor products delivered to 12,000 stores in 33 countries. In addition, such retail corporations as Walmart, Nestle, and Unilever also expressed their intention to implement the IBM\u2019s solution. One of the largest car manufacturers Daimler AG together with Landesbank Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (LBBW) successfully finished the trial blockchain project in 2018. Several German banks \u2013 Esslingen-N\u00fcrtingen, Ludwigsburg, and Ostalb \u2013 also joined the project. Within the framework of this trial project, all the transactions were conducted using blockchain. Now, Daimler AG and LBBW intend to issue joint credits under smart contracts. The Blockchain is steadily penetrating into the aviation industry. In December 2018, the American technology company Honeywell announced the launch of the blockchain platform to buy and sell aviation parts. The company believes that this solution will become an ideal tool to track the origin and movement of goods. By the way, Honeywell is not the only enterprise that employs innovations in this branch. The air carrier Swissport is implementing the blockchain solution to monitor air freights while Singapore Airlines creates blockchain wallets for loyal clients. The Internet companies keep pace with the traditional businesses. A range of large players started to work with digital money and blockchain in 2018. Thus, Yahoo integrated trading with Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin on its platform, Yahoo Finance. The company\u2019s Japanese arm Yahoo Japan is going to open a cryptocurrency exchange in April 2019 or later. Microsoft purchased a famous web service GitHub to host and develop IT projects. The blockchain platform TRON bought BitTorrent service to integrate its protocol into it in order to increase the loading rate. Blockchain can considerably improve business processes and markets. The technology has proved its usefulness in the field of data storage and processing, logistics, cybersecurity, finance, legal activities, and many others. A number of countries consider up-to-date technologies as an opportunity for economic growth and strive to facilitate their development. There are, for example, Georgia, Spain, Australia, Estonia, and others. The Philippines are among those blockchain-friendly states. The Philippines\u2019 Department of Science and Technology (DOST) is focused on the development of breakthrough technologies in the country and is currently studying them. To get expertise and advice in this field, the authorities have cooperated with the Noah Project, a recognized leader in blockchain in the Asian region. The company is applying the decentralized ledger technology at Dakak Beach Resort and has introduced several hi-tech payment solutions to the market. A user-friendly and secure Noah Wallet is one of these solutions. This tool helps people store and use their Noah Coins and other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether. Besides, the Noah specialists created Noah Pay, a blockchain application, whose aim is to make crypto payments more convenient and efficient. Noah Pay allows customers to acquire goods and services just in one click by using a QR code. Moreover, this app also opens new opportunities for vendors, allowing them to accept and process crypto payments, as well as attract new clients from among crypto holders. All these achievements moved the Noah Project closer to its primary goal, which is to build an ecosystem totally based on blockchain and its own cryptocurrency. This ecosystem consists of the future crypto hub Noah City and digital leisure and recreational facility Noah Resort. Users will be able to employ their Noah Coins across the system and get various bonuses for that. The provided payment solutions will help them smoothly manage their digital funds. It seems the Philippines treats blockchain solutions seriously and is going to join such innovative countries as Switzerland or Malta. Who knows, maybe Noah City will become a new Zug. Blockchain startups boomed in gold 2017 and survived in bearish 2018. Which will be the year of 2019? The market participants believe that strong and time-proved projects will rule the day this year. Those who performed well and made progress will continue reaching new milestones. At the same time, new much more professional and success-hungry ventures will appear and will compete with the existing ones.", "date": "2019-02-26T09:48:52+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 26}

The EOS price, for example, is still under a fair bit of bearish pressure at this time. Despite some positive developments behind the scenes, it would appear the price is not responding in kind at this time. In the cryptocurrency world, there is hardly ever anything like a \u201cmajor trend\u201d. Although a lot of projects rely on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum first and foremost, some will buck the trend at any given time. In today\u2019s edition, it would appear EOS is bucking the positive trend, which will come as a rather big surprise to a lot of traders and speculators. There is no real reason for this particular trend either, which makes it a bit odd first and foremost. To put this in perspective, the EOS price is not benefiting from Bitcoin\u2019s gains. More specifically, there is a 2.2% decline in USD value down to $3.49. There is also a 2.5% decline in EOS/BTC, which drives the value down to 90,636 Satoshi. Neither of these developments is all that promising, although these declines are not exactly steep either. Considering how EOS still notes a hefty trading volume, it seems plausible to assume this negative trend can turn around eventually. On social media, there is seemingly no negativity toward EOS at this time. More specifically, EOS New York has shared a recap of some of the most recent developments and updates affecting the ecosystem. It is evident the dApp ecosystem is still growing nicely, and the upcoming changes to EOS governance will be very crucial to keep an eye on. A lot of traders are keeping a very close eye on what the future will hold for EOS in the price department. More specifically, it seems some people expect the price to bounce in the coming hours. While it remains to be seen how things will play out exactly, there is no real indication of a further downtrend. Even so, these markets tend to evolve in mysterious ways. As has been the case for virtually all cryptocurrencies, there are arbitrage opportunities for EOS as well. Although the profits are pretty interesting to look into, it remains to be seen how long this price gap remains in place. As long as EOS remains bearish like it is right now, there will undoubtedly be some price difference between the top exchanges. All things considered, there is a good chance EOS will follow the overall positive market trend sooner or later. However, it is also apparent all of that momentum heavily hinges on Bitcoin\u2019s price developments, which still look rather uncertain at this time.

While Bitcoin is on the mend, most of the other markets are still trying to find their way. The Litecoin price, while trying to move up, is still losing ground to Bitcoin. That in itself will create an interesting situation well worth keeping an eye on. In the world of cryptocurrencies, there is no such thing as a definite market trend. While it is true the overall momentum seems to favor bullish momentum right now, the reality can easily be very different. With Bitcoin in the green, one would expect most markets to follow. However, this makes it a bit more difficult for altcoins to note gains over BTC in the process. As far as the Litecoin price is concerned, the uptrend has yet to materialize properly at this time. Although there is indeed an uptrend in USD value to push the value to $45.84 again, there is also a minor drop in LTC/BTC at the same time. While a 0.15% deficit is nothing to be overly concerned about, it is evident the uptrend may not necessarily materialize all that easily either. It can make for some intriguing momentum in the coming hours, especially with this high overall trading volume. There are some key developments which would seemingly warrant a Litecoin value increase. First and foremost, the Litecoin Foundation announced a partnership with Glory Kickboxing. This will ensure LTC is the official cryptocurrency for this sports organization, and users will be able to pay with LTC for GLORY events in the future. A major development for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Secondly, Mavens is confident now is the time to put his entire tax refund into Litecoin. That in itself is a bullish signal in its own right, although one has to wonder if it is the smart decision in the long run. While one could buy a decent amount of LTC with this tax refund, putting thousands of Dollars into one cryptocurrency and not diversifying might not necessarily be the most feasible approach. Regardless of how the overall crypto market trend may look at any given time, there is always an arbitrage opportunity to take advantage of. In the case of Litecoin, it would seem there is some good profit to be made for those who simply want to increase their BTC holdings in quick succession. A 1% profit should never be looked down on, although there may be more lucrative opportunities later today, depending on how the LTC price evolves. All of the current market signs seem to indicate something interesting is bound to happen. Whether or not that will result in bullish market momentum, is a very different topic of debate. Considering how Bitcoin is noting very minor gains, a status quo may not necessarily be the worst outcome either.

While most of the top currencies are moving up slightly, it seems the Binance Coin price is becoming pretty bullish once again. That in itself is a very interesting development, primarily because the $10 target is well within reach once again. It is not all that easy for any cryptocurrency to make a positive push as of right now. That in itself is surprising to some, although most people can see the bigger picture. With Bitcoin still remaining on somewhat uncertain ground, it is only normal the alternative markets will face a few hurdles along the way as well. Binance Coin is trying to break free from the pack right now, although it is still too early to speak of a confirmed breakout. To put this in perspective, it seems as if things are heading in a promising direction where the Binance Coin price is concerned. With a 4.3% gain in USD value, the current price of $9.95 is not too far off the $10 mark. There is also a 3.5% gain in BTC and 2.2% gain in ETH value. All things are coming up green for Binance Coin all of a sudden, although it remains to be seen if the trading volume can effectively support this uptrend for very long. One of the main reasons for this ongoing rise of BNB is how the ecosystem continues to grow in many different ways. Using BNB is about much more than reducing Binance trading fees these days, which only further strengthens the interest in this asset. Although the number of major use cases is still limited, significant progress has been made in recent months. There is also an interesting tweet by the Binance CEO which seems to confirm Binance Coin is the top token on Ethereum\u2019s blockchain in terms of market cap. That in itself will provide ammunition for a fair few different debates in the future. It is vastly more prominent than Maker, USD Coin, and TrueUSD, although all of those tokens target a very different audience first and foremost. Last but not least, there are a few people who would like to see a partnership between PayPal and Binance in the future. While there is a case to be made there, it seems unlikely such a partnership will ever happen in the real world. After all, those companies are very different from one another. It could be a lucrative partnership for both companies, though. With this positive momentum locked in place, it is evident things may continue down this path for a few more hours. Once the price hits $10, however, it is possible there will be a lot more negative pressure on BNB, for rather obvious reasons. It is evident there is no confirmation a bull trend will effectively materialize at this time. As such, there is a genuine reason to be cautious where this uptrend is concerned.

With Bitcoin moving in the green again, the expectations for all alternative markets are rather steep. What is remarkable is how the XRP price is moving up in quick succession. Its 5% gain primarily stems forth from the recent Coinbase Pro announcement. It has been coming for a day or two now, but it appears most of the cryptocurrencies, tokens, and digital assets are turning bullish once again. Although Bitcoin is still relatively fragile right now, it would appear there is some positive momentum brewing across other markets. XRP Is an interesting example in this regard, as its price is shooting up like a rocket once again. To put this in perspective, it would appear there is a 5.5% XRP price uptrend in terms of USD value. As such, the value per XRP has returned to $0.32. Considering how the price was bound to hit the low $0.29s over the weekend, it seems things are taking a turn for the better. There is also a 5% improvement in XRP/BTC, as this ratio reached 8,326 Satoshi once again. Both developments are very interesting to keep an eye on under these circumstances. The big news is how XRP is being listed on Coinbase Pro. It is important to distinguish this doesn\u2019t mean XRP will be added to Coinbase itself, but only the Coinbase Pro platform. While this is still a very big development, all things considered, one has to keep in mind there is only so much momentum this announcement can generate. Inbound transfers are already live, but trading has not been enabled live as of yet. There is also an interesting tweet by Binance\u2019s CEO regarding XRP. Although many people dislike the exchange for not adding XRP at this time, he does confirm XRP has a great user base. While this is a nod of approval of sorts, it will not necessarily lead to a listing on Binance either. For the XRP community, it will offer an interesting topic of debate regardless. It is always good to see the community pay close attention to service providers meddling with XRP. In the case of LiteBit, a European service provider, they are still labeling XRP as RIpple. That is not entirely uncommon, although it is something which should have been fixed a long time ago. Ripple and XRP are two completely different things, thus it is crucial to distinguish between the two. For the time being, it would appear as if the XRP momentum will remain bullish for a few more hours. However, one has to keep in mind this will primarily depend on what happens to Bitcoin in the coming hours and days. As long as Bitcoin\u2019s momentum remains pretty weak, anything can happen, either for better or worse. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

This becomes very apparent given the launch of \u201cblockchain phones\u201d and devices capable of supporting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin out of the box. The Electroneum team, while building an altcoin for the mobile ecosystem, has also built a phone. Known as the M1, it can be rather appealing to the right people. One would not necessarily expect a cryptocurrency project to unveil its own native phone. Building such a device is one thing, but ensuring it can be distributed on a large scale is something else entirely. In the case of Electroneum, the team has built a new phone known as the 1. While it remains unclear who manufactured it exactly, the device will provide people with access to ETN cloud mining. For those who have paid close attention to Electroneum, the team has developed mobile cloud mining apps. These applications were released on both iOS and Android in recent weeks. So far, it would appear as if the community has responded positively to these applications. While users need to perform a brief KYC procedure before gaining access to the service, they will earn a small passive income every month from running the application. By taking this concept one step further, the Electroneum team confirms they are seemingly in it for the long haul. A physical product release was not what most people expected from this project anytime soon. However, the team is not too pleased with how the phone industry is evolving. These days, paying $1,000 for a new phone every year or two years is slowly becoming the new normal. Especially for people who live in developing regions, such devices are not accessible nor affordable. The Electroneum.M1 aims to offer a cheap and viable alternative in this regard. It is an Android device running version 8.1 Go, powered by a Quad Core 1.3Ghz CPU. It also supports 4G and dual SIM cards, which can be of great value to residents in developing countries. Although this device is not designed to be a powerhouse by any means, it can still be a promising development. The main focus lies with selling this $80 phone to as many people as possible and expand the Electroneum ecosystem in the process. According to the website, users will receive up to $3 worth of ETN per month by running the cloud mining application. It is not the most lucrative option to make money, but it can help offset some costs. Additionally, the Electroneum cloud mining app recently introduced new features. Users can now top up their air time in select countries, which was introduced just ahead of launching the M1 phone. While there will be some debate as to whether or not this is the first cryptocurrency phone on the market, it is a development which will bring some more positive attention to cryptocurrency as a whole.

As far as the VeChain price is concerned, there is a big drop, just like most other markets. However, there are some interesting behind-the-scenes developments which can affect the situation in a promising manner. Although Bitcoin will determine how altcoins will behave in the coming hours and days, there are always individual project\u2019s developments to take note of. While Bitcoin is currently dragging VeChain down with it, there are still some upcoming developments which can get people a bit more excited about VET, and even VTHOR. While that might not affect the price immediately, it still shows there are still plenty of things to look forward to. To be more specific, the VeChain price has dropped by 8.45% in the past few hours. However, there is \u201cjust\u201d a 0.25% drop in BTC value, which seems to indicate some market reversal may be in order in that particular department. With a current value of $0.004495, VET is still valued rather fairly at this time. Its overall trading volume is not looking bad either, although many traders would have expected a bit more in that regard. The big news involving VeChain for this week is how the Gate.io exchange will airdrop VTHO tokens to VET holders. Additionally, the company has officially confirmed they will launch a VTHO/ETH trading market. It is something a lot of long-term investors and speculators will be quite pleased with, although it remains to be seen how this will affect the value of VeChain itself. Mr. Brian tries to keep a level head when it comes to dealing with the VET price momentum. While the chart seems to indicate things are not looking all that bad right now, there is nothing to get overly excited about just yet either. A breakout of some sorts would be quite interesting to see, although it may not necessarily occur today or tomorrow. It would appear today is one of the best days to perform market arbitrage trading. Considering how all markets are subject to volatile momentum these days, one has to keep in mind not all exchanges will maintain the same value per coin at all times. In the case of VeChain, there is a pretty big gap between Binance and Gate, which can yield a profit of up to 4%. This is in line with some other altcoins and tokens on the market today. Although the current outlook does not necessarily warrant any form of excitement, the things happening behind the scenes are quite significant. An official VTHO airdrop shows VeChain is still making a lot of waves in the industry as a whole. While it is possible all markets will see some bullish momentum once everything has calmed down again, no one knows for sure when that will happen. Until then, VeChain holders will need to remain patient first and foremost. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

Ever since Bitcoin decided to turn bearish for no apparent reason, the overall momentum has been rather troublesome. Some markets are dealing with a lot more pressure compared to others. The Cardano price, for example, is bleeding value left, right, and center at this time. It is safe to say none of the alternative markets will see any real positive momentum unless Bitcoin picks up the pace in a significant manner. For the time being, it seems unlikely that will happen in the near future, primarily because there is nothing to warrant an effective uptrend. In the case of Cardano, its close-knit reliance on Bitcoin is causing a lot of problems over the past 24 hours. More specifically, the Cardano price has dropped by over 13% in the past 24 hours. Because of this major setback, the USD value per ADA has now hit $0.042872. There is also a 5.4% decline in ADA/BTC, pushing the value down to 1,122 Satoshi. While a dip to 1,000 Satoshi will not necessarily become a problem this week, the pressure may not necessarily relent either. An ongoing decrease in ADA trading volume also doesn\u2019t appear to bode well. Whereas most crypto markets are noting a small to medium-sized increase in overall trading volume, it does not seem as if Cardano is following suit. For a top 15 coin by market cap, it appears there is just $47.5m in 24-hour trades. Not all that impressive, especially when compared to all other markets. Until that situation improves in a significant manner, it seems unlikely ADA will become an exciting market once again. There is one very promising development coming to Cardano in the near future. A recent tweet by Charles Hoskinson confirms stakepools will be introduced at some point in the future. Stakepools can be a very promising addition to the Cardano ecosystem. Further details regarding this effort have yet to be unveiled and confirmed at this point, though. Even so, it seems to get a lot of ADA community members excited at this point. For those traders and speculators who simply want to make a lot of good money, trading cryptocurrencies may be a bit too dangerous right now. Exploring the arbitrage opportunity involving ADA may be a safer bet, assuming one has access to both platforms involved in this trade. For a potential profit of up to 3.3%, it is evident some effort may be required. Under these circumstances, such a profit should never be overlooked. All of these signs confirm this bear trend is very real and can continue to pose a lot of problems in the next few days. Considering how Bitcoin dictates the pace for all markets as of right now, there will be nothing to rejoice about until the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency gets its head out of the gutter. When that will happen, or what will trigger a sudden reversal, is anyone\u2019s guess at this time. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

One interesting market to keep an eye on in this regard is Dogecoin. Although it doesn\u2019t lean on Bitcoin\u2019s price trend as much as other currencies, the mighty DOGE has noted some impressive gains. As the Dogecoin price reclaims the $0.002 level, the coming hours will prove to be rather interesting for traders. Although there was some concern regarding Dogecoin yesterday, it would appear most of the concerns were a bit premature. Considering how Dogecoin simply followed the overall bearish market trend yesterday afternoon, one had to wonder if that would remain the case for very long. This popular altcoin usually does its own thing regardless of the overall market trend. Over the past few hours, the Dogecoin price has risen by 3.6% to push the value back to $0.002017. There is also a 3.15% increase in DOGE/BTC, although that just results in a shift from 51 to 52 Satoshi. Both developments will be of great interest to a lot of people, although Dogecoin has never been one of the strongest risers either. As such, this uptrend will not necessarily result in spectacular gains in quick succession. Over the past few months, there has been a lot of debate regarding the future development of Dogecoin. Although there are no immediate changes required to make this project better, some people openly criticize the lack of further development. Dogecoin Memes decided to turn this debacle into a funny meme, although it seems unlikely that will settle the matter once and for all. Some users may also experience problems when withdrawing Dogecoin from the Coinsquare platform. While it\u2019s a bit unclear what is going on exactly, the team is working on a solution. No new update regarding this matter has been posted ever since the company confirmed something was amiss. However, it seems no major problems will be created because of this temporary setback. For those traders who simply want to pocket a quick profit, there is an appealing Dogecoin arbitrage opportunity available as of today. The DOGE price between Koineks and Sistemkoin is very different, which gives traders a profit of up to 1.2% per trade. Although it seems as if things have gone quiet on the DOGE arbitrage front as of late, this option is still worth looking into throughout the course of the day. All of the current market signs seem to indicate there will be a solid crypto market recovery in the coming hours and days. As long as Bitcoin doesn\u2019t turn immensely bearish again, there is nothing to be overly concerned about at this time. For Dogecoin watchers, this most recent price recovery will be a welcome sight as well. The $0.002 level is crucial for this altcoin, although turning it into solid support has been a big challenge.

Considering how all markets rely on Bitcoin in one way or another, things are not looking too great right now. The Dogecoin price, while usually remarkably stable, is facing an onslaught as well. Its value dropped below $0.002 again and the 50 Satoshi level may not remain in place for much longer either. It has quickly become apparent the bearish trend which began shaping up yesterday is not a short-term setback. Although the markets are showing minor attempts of turning bullish once again, it seems rather unlikely there will be any positive momentum to speak of. No market is capable of escaping this negative pull of Bitcoin, not even Dogecoin. That in itself is not a promising sign for the remainder of February 2019. To put this in perspective, the Dogecoin price has decreased by 7.6% to bring its USD value to $0.001943. There is also a minor 0.5% decline in DOGE/BTC, which seems to indicate Dogecoin might make some form of impact in that regard. However, the 51 Satoshi level is currently under so much pressure, one has to wonder if it can effectively hold up. For now, that is a question which cannot be answered right away. Even though the price momentum might not necessarily make too many people excited, there are still plenty of people who like Dogecoin. Tom, for example, enjoys the speed and stability of Dogecoin which, in his opinion, cannot be found in most other cryptocurrencies. While it is certainly not the only currency to note some stability and speed of transacting, Dogecoin has also one of the most solid brands on the market. There is also some concern regarding the current and future status of Dogemoon. Although any cloud mining project deserves to be scrutinized first and foremost, it appears a lot of people have been using this service. With the website going completely dark without prior announcement of explanation, there is a chance this program will be shut down for good. Not necessarily the development users are looking for, but it was somewhat to be expected. Similar to virtually all other cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets on the market, there are a few arbitrage options to explore where Dogecoin is concerned. Although the gains are a bit lower compared to some other markets, the 1.2% profit on average is not necessarily all that bad either. As the price remains volatile for some time to come, there is a chance this arbitrage gap will remain in place for some to come. All of the Dogecoin-related circumstances seem to confirm the USD value will not necessarily budge all that much. When it comes to DOGE/BTC, however, there is something to look forward to, as this ratio seems to be correcting itself rather swiftly. While that may not necessarily result in much positivity overall, there is always a chance things will improve from here on out. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

The unexpected setbacks which occurred yesterday are still leaving their mark today. For most altcoins, this will spell a lot of trouble. The XRP price is the first to see its seven-day gains wiped out completely and turned into a negative. It is always interesting to see how things are evolving when the market turns bearish out of the blue. Although it is not entirely abnormal for such a correction to kick in, one has to keep in mind it was not necessarily expected to be this severe. In fact, it would appear the current trend is only the beginning of what is yet to come in the coming days and weeks. That in itself is not a pleasant outlook by any means. To put this in perspective, the XRP price has dropped by over 10% in USD value, down to $0.303. There is also another 1.7% setback in XRP/BTC, as one XRP is no longer valued at 8,000 Satoshi. Instead, it now sits at 7,931 Satoshi, with no real hope of recovering anytime soon. Although the trading volume is still in place, it has become apparent most users want to sell instead of buying and holding right now. On social media, there are some very interesting discussions taking place right now. Andrew Bit, for example, expects the downtrend to continue for quite some time to come. There is a genuine chance Bitcoin\u2019s momentum will drag everything down even further, although that has not been officially confirmed by any means. For XRP, the downward channel is still in play, and it seems that may not come to change in the near future. There is something to be cautiously optimistic about where XRP is concerned. More specifically, Lionel remains excited about the prospect of seeing SBI unveil its live service which should use XRP as a currency. For the time being, that may be the only big news that can potentially push the price back up, even though developments like these hardly ever affect the price in the first few days. When looking for ways to make money with cryptocurrency, there are numerous options worth exploring. Despite the current bearish momentum, there are a fair few good arbitrage opportunities around when it comes to XRP. Some of these options can yield a rather high profit of up to 4.5%, which is rather unlikely when it comes to digital assets and cryptocurrencies. Today seems like to be a good day to take advantage of this opportunity. All of the signs point toward further bearish pressure throughout the day. While it is not impossible for this trend to effectively turn around pretty quickly, it currently seems unlikely that will happen. Why this drop has materialized, remains a big question mark. Many rumors hint at market manipulation, but as always, that is nearly impossible to prove. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Although Sundays usually provide bearish momentum, today\u2019s deficit is quite steep. Holders of TRX will not be too pleased with the current Tron price. The steep losses are causing a lot of unrest on the market, which is only to be expected at this time. Every single time the value of Bitcoin drops by even the smallest amount, all other markets will quickly follow suit. Tron is no exception in this regard, as it too relies on Bitcoin\u2019s price trend first and foremost. That symbiotic relationship is now claiming its toll, as Tron loses a lot more value than Bitcoin. Not a good trend to end the week on, although there isn\u2019t much that can be done about it. To put this in perspective, the Tron price has lost nearly 7% in value over the past two to three hours. Because of this dip, the USD value of this token has now dropped to $0.0234. There is also a 1.5% dropoff in TRX/BTC, pushing the ratio down to 615 Satoshi. It is red all across the board, although Tron is not the only market facing a lot of pressure at this time. On social media, there is a lot of excitement, regardless of what the price may be at the time. Justin Sun has confirmed Tron will receive another major protocol upgrade in a few days. Several new features will be introduced, including performance improvements and multisig support. A very promising upgrade, by the look of things. There is still some confusion as to what the correlation between Tron and BitTorrent Token will be. As Goldn explains, they complement one another to create the \u201cwatching Netflix on Android\u201d experience of cryptocurrency. A very bold claim, as there is no point in comparing completely different things with Tron or BTT. In fact, comments like those tend to attract a lot of backlash. Some people consider such bold claims to be clear shilling attempts. WeitBlick, for example, is convinced Netflix and Android are real, whereas Tron has yet to fulfill on nearly all of its promises. A valid point, although one that will undoubtedly create some debates as well. For the time being, there is no clear indication as to how long this downtrend will remain in place. Until Bitcoin goes into the green again, it seems unlikely any of the alternative markets will be able to. For Tron, this drop comes at a crucial time, as one would expect a bullish surge prior to this newly announced protocol upgrade.

In the altcoin department, it would appear as if the Electroneum price is poised to move up again. Its USD losses are kept to a minimum, whereas ETN is noting impressive gains over Bitcoin. A remarkable trend, although the community is abuzz with excitement as well. It is evident most cryptocurrencies rely on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum. For the time being, that will not necessarily yield too many positive results. Although most of the hourly charts are starting to turn green again, overcoming these steep deficits will not be easy. One currency not too bothered by this onslaught is Electroneum. It too lost value, but far less than virtually all other projects in the top 100. More specifically, the Electroneum price currently sits at $0.007575. This is a bit lower compared to the $0.008 reached earlier in the week. Given Bitcoin\u2019s sudden reversal, one has to be glad the market did not crumble further. As of right now, there is just a 1.14% loss in USD value. On the flipside, ETN gained 5.5% over Bitcoin, pushing the value to 198 Satoshi once again. On social media, there is a lot of buzz and hype surrounding Electroneum right now. The upcoming Mobile World Congress event has many people excited, although the actual announcements remain a bit unclear. Some Twitter accounts go a bit overboard when it comes to highlighting this event, but that is somewhat to be expected under these circumstances. Some \u201cinsider sources\u201d even claim there will not be just one, but two separate announcements at MWC2019. This will undoubtedly lead to a fair bit of speculation, although it remains to be seen if the actual news warrants all of the excitement. Considering how the mobile cloud mining apps have already been released, it remains to be seen if something else can make such a big impact. When it comes to determining which is the best altcoin to invest in right now, there will be as many different opinions as there are people. Damian Mooruth claims Electroneum is all one needs to succeed, primarily because the altcoin had a very solid week ahead of the recent dip. Even so, some other currencies noted far bigger gains. All things considered, one would expect it to be a mere matter of time until ETN recovers its USD-based losses. Even if Bitcoin were to remain bearish, the ongoing rise in ETN/BTC can negate most of the pressure with ease.

That is only understandable, as most expectations have been suppressed for nearly a full year. As far as the XRP price is concerned, the momentum seems promising as well. Oddly enough, the asset struggles to improve its position in BTC value. Even today, those gains are nearly non-existent. In this volatile industry, it is evident most traders buy altcoins, tokens, and assets to increase their Bitcoin holdings over time. This approach has worked out quite well for several years. For those who bought XRP in recent months in the hopes of multiplying their BTC holdings, things are not necessarily working out all that well. In fact, the asset is still struggling to maintain the current level despite its overall gains. To put this in perspective, the XRP price has risen by 4.5% in USD value. Following this new increase, one XRP is now valued at $0.333. That will please a lot of investors, even though there is still a lot of work to be done. In terms of XRP/BTC, things are not changing all that much. In fact, the 0.2% improvement barely pushes the price to 8,045 Satoshi. Not the development people have been looking for. On social media, there are numerous expectations as far as RIpple\u2019s native asset is concerned. Bolsatero expects a push to $0.35 prior to heading as high as $0.55. A very ambitious outlook, primarily because XRP does not the strong gains all of its market cap \u201ccompetitors\u201d offer right now. That doesn\u2019t mean XRP is in bad shape, but it is important to keep one\u2019s expectations in check. KenCarv, on the other hand, has a bit of a different prediction. While there is always a chance he is absolutely correct, these markets tend to evolve in mysterious ways. Expecting XRP to go parabolic after Bitcoin gets a higher high would be something to behold for sure. Whether or not that can or will happen, is a different matter altogether. Last but not least, there is another interesting prediction by CryptHawk. Heading to $0,58 seems inevitable according to this user. While it is in line with some other predictions on social media, this will all mainly hinge on how Bitcoin\u2019s value evolves in the coming days. Assuming Bitcoin remains bullish, there is still no guarantee XRP will head down a similar path in the process. All of these signs confirm XRP is moving up slowly but steadily. While it may not be to the liking of those speculators chasing quick profits, it is usually the better approach. There is no point in pushing a value up by 25% only to have it result in a 35% correction the next week. As such, XRP seems to be doing just fine, although it is not the most spectacular market right now. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Nearly none of the top markets note any real momentum that is worth taking note of. Especially the EOS price is dealing with a major retrace right now, despite hitting $4 earlier in the week. Reclaiming those losses will not come easy in the slightest, especially not if Bitcoin remains in the red. Most cryptocurrency traders and enthusiasts had expected some form of correction to kick in. More often than not, such a correction occurs during the weekend, when little to no fresh capital is injected into the markets. It seems this weekend has been a prime target for people looking to cash out profits or trigger a dump of sorts. All markets lost a lot of value, but EOS was seemingly hit a bit harder. Ever since Bitcoin started sliding down a slippery slope, the EOS price has looked very shaky as well. The end result is a near 13% drop in USD value, down to $3.61. There is also a 5.4% deficit in EOS/BTC, pushing the value down to 94,222 Satoshi. Neither trend is hopeful whatsoever, although things can look very different tomorrow. What is rather interesting is how the overall crypto trading volume sits at over $38.4bn. That is rather significant, for a Sunday. EOS maintains its strong volume even today, with over $2.4bn in trades. The majority of its volume comes from USDT pairs provided by OKEx, Huobi Global, ZB.com, and Bit-Z. It would appear EOS/BTC or EOS/ETH is not as popular of a pair as one would expect during this bearish trend. Behind the scenes of EOS, there are some interesting developments taking place. EOS42 confirms they are looking into an opt-in account recovery solution for all users. While this is still a proposal and not an \u201capproved development, the concept will be very interesting to most EOS holders. Dealing with a hacked account is never fun, and being able to recover it somehow can put a lot of minds at ease. Daniel Stricker is not too amused with the current developments, which is only understandable. The bears are in full control of the market, although it remains to be seen if they are done dumping, for the time being. There have always been concerns regarding market manipulation, yet there is never any real evidence to prove such claims. Even today, the massive decrease in overall valuation is not a sign of manipulation, regardless of how orchestrated the effort may look. Although the EOS market doesn\u2019t look all too appealing right now, not all of the positive momentum has been eroded either. Over the past seven days, EOS still gained a lot of value, even though it lost 12% of that value today. There is always a chance this momentum will resume its original trend sooner or later, but for now, it is anyone\u2019s guess as to what will happen early next week.

Some altcoins lost over 10% in value in the span of a few minutes. Especially the Bitcoin chart looks worrisome in this regard. Litecoin price watchers will not be too happy with this trend, albeit it was somewhat to be expected. When the momentum remains positive in the cryptocurrency for several days, one has to wonder how things will evolve in the near future. As was to be expected, a major downtrend occurred earlier today. The hourly charts look extremely bearish for all markets, with Litecoin facing a lot of pressure across the board. The weekend may not necessarily end on a high after all. To put this in perspective, all cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets are losing 5% in value or more on the hourly chart. This is primarily because Bitcoin is into overbought territory. As far as the Litecoin price is concerned, a net 6% loss is the current bottom line, although this figure will undoubtedly fluctuate a fair bit throughout the day. With the value driven down to $46.08, or 0.0119 BTC, a lot of questions go unanswered. It is quite interesting to see how the community responds to this somewhat new challenge. Bitcoin Litecoin Master sees the dip as a golden opportunity to buy more LTC. Even if it were to dip further, there is no reason not to buy LTC, according to this user. Given the current violet market swing, continuing to buy may not necessarily be the smartest idea. Although there are still notable gains in the past seven days, a lot of momentum has been eroded all of a sudden. RayTheStoryteller shares an interesting tidbit of personal experience involving people who show an interest in cryptocurrency. While it is true the price per Bitcoin may be rather steep, that doesn\u2019t necessarily make it not worth buying. Purchasing Litecoin can be quite lucrative as well, although most people tend to do so to increase their BTC holdings. It appears as if most traders expected the Litecoin momentum to turn pretty bearish today. Brad Metz expected the pullback to occur a bit later yet it seems the speculators and traders were well ahead of the curve in this regard. How bad things will get, is anyone\u2019s guess at this point. This violent momentum can trigger a lot of panic selling moving forward. All things considered, the bearish pressure everyone expected to materialize has finally arrived. While the hourly candles look bleak, if not downright bothersome, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean this trend will remain in place. The high trading volume of all markets could lead to the dip being bought up quickly. A lot of traders simply took profit, and it is showing. For Litecoin, the next few hours will confirm if the value can return to $50 soon. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While Bitcoin is on most people\u2019s mind right now, it appears the Maker price is also worth paying attention to. With its solid gains in recent days, the value per MKR has surpassed $750 once again. It is evident a lot of people are looking for any cryptocurrency which can make them a lot of good money in quick succession. While it is certainly true this can apply to any market as of right now, most of the top currencies and assets have medium-sized gains first and foremost. Maker is one of the few notable exceptions, as this project is well on its way to enter the market cap top 15. Over the past 24 hours, the Maker price has risen by another 11.3% to bring the USD value back to $759. In terms of MKR/BTC, the ratio improved by 6.76% and now sits at 0.18287 BTC. Maker also gained 1.68% on Ethereum, bringing its ratio to 4.66 ETH. Very impressive trends all around, although it is evident this momentum may prove very difficult to maintain first and foremost. Most of the top 15 cryptocurrencies note gains because of their inflated trading volume. For a weekend, a total volume of over $34.28bn is absolutely insane, especially compared to a few weeks ago. In the case of Maker, it appears the volume remains relatively low. With a token valued so highly, one would expect this volume to be much higher compared to the current $2.7m. Even so, it may prove sufficient to keep the bull run going for a while longer. One thing potentially keeping the Maker value run grounded somewhat is how this token is not traded on most major exchanges right now. Instead, Ethfinex and the Kyber Network are the biggest MKR trading platforms right now. HitBTC is also in the top three, although that one is well behind the other two at this time. It will be interesting to see if this token finds its way to other exchanges in the near future. What is rather interesting is how specific Twitter accounts keep tabs on how things are evolving where the major exchanges are concerned. Although someone successfully sent 500 MKR to Bitfinex, it seems those funds have either not been sold or failed to crash the uptrend altogether. Rest assured more people will be moving their MKR to exchanges in the coming days, especially if this uptrend remains in place. All things considered, it seems to be a matter of time until the MKR price run comes to an abrupt halt. Not because there is anything wrong with the project, but the low trading volume, combined with nearly zero activity on the bigger exchanges, usually do not bode that well for this particular market. Even so, the crypto industry is full of surprise first and foremost. Anything can happen, especially where markets like Maker are concerned. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While nearly all top markets are in the green again, few of them are as bullish as Ethereum. Right now, it seems the Ethereum price could hit $160 without too many problems. With the upcoming Constantinople fork in sight, the coming days will undoubtedly get interesting. For a lot of altcoin projects, delaying a key protocol upgrade can spell disaster. It seemed as if Ethereum\u2019s delayed fork would pose its own set of problems, although that eventually did not last all that long. While some traders were dismayed, the price has rebounded sharply ever since. As the actual fork draws near at this time, the value per ETH is surging once again. To put this in perspective, Ethereum has turned bullish when Bitcoin did so this afternoon. However, the Ethereum price has risen by over 5.6% in USD value, which is a lot steeper than BTC. With a current price tag of $157.44, or 0.0382 BTC, things are looking very good for this popular token. Its overall trading volume is equally impressive, with $4.24bn in trades. On social media, there is a lot of ETH-related talk right now. Most people are interested in the Constantinople fork and how it will affect the ETH value over the next week or so. Airdrop Daily Updates heavily shills ETH because of this fork, although these kinds of messages will undoubtedly have an adverse effect sooner or later. Seba, on the other hand, isn\u2019t too sure Constantinople will yield a positive shift in ETH value. In fact, this user is convinced a major dump will occur once the fork goes live. There is this trend in crypto where holders buy the rumor and sell when the news is confirmed. History may very well repeat itself in that regard, although one never knows how things will play out. Turkish traders are also keeping a close eye on the current market trend, which is only to be expected. Some users had high hopes for a pullback before this most recent uptrend, alas they missed out on that opportunity. For Ethereum as a whole, it is a good trend, albeit that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there will be no further dips in the next few days. For the time being, there is plenty of bullish momentum affecting Ethereum and all other markets. That in itself only further confirms this weekend is very different from those over the past eleven months. A bullish signal has been sent to everyone, although there are still plenty of traders looking to cash out any and all profits they can whenever the opportunity arises.

Bitcoin still hasn\u2019t resumed its bullish trend, nor has it lost any significant value either. As such, the EOS price suffers from the same sense of not knowing what to do with itself. The push to $4 appears intact, yet carving out new gains will not be easy. This makes for a rather interesting market to keep an eye on over the weekend. There has been a pretty strong focus on EOS among enthusiasts and traders over the past two weeks. Not only because of its dApp success to date, but primarily because of its strong value increase. In the past week, EOS gained over 30% without too many problems. That in itself is rather remarkable, although Bitcoin\u2019s run has something to do with it as well. As far as the EOS price is concerned today, it would appear something is happening. A 3.5% gain in USD value and a 2% gain in BTC value are rather interesting. While every market trend needs to be kept an eye on at all times, it would appear as if this sideways trading momentum may continue for a while longer. The current price of $4 or 96,978 Satoshi could hold without too many problems. Behind the scenes of EOS, a few interesting developments are taking place. EOSBet is one of the biggest dApps on this blockchain as of right now. The team has confirmed they will bring additional games to the platform in the near future. Which games those will be exactly, remains to be determined. It is a very positive development for the project and the entire ecosystem, though. When it comes to finding the \u201cbest\u201d crypto community, opinions will be divided first and foremost. Everyone has their own view on what makes a community great these days Luk Zurski is confident EOS has no real hates and focuses on building an ecosystem first and foremost. That in itself can make it a good community, although there will be others who value different qualities first and foremost. At this time, most people are interested in the EOS chart first and foremost. Based on the current trend, one would expect the push to continue. Mind Trader even expects the value to hit $4.65, which may be a bit too optimistic. However, there is a chance such a trend will materialize if the momentum picks up once again. Given the growth taking place behind the scenes, it appears things are coming together nicely where EOS is concerned. Although none of those developments will automatically impact the price directly, one has to keep in mind the market value and the \u201cactual value\u201d of a project are hardly ever the same. For EOS, remaining in the market cap top 4 will not pose any problems, at least for today. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While that is a good reason to be rather optimistic, one also has to keep in mind not all markets evolve in the same manner. The Qtum price is rising rapidly, as its value seems on track to hit $2.5. This is in line with some other markets, although its monster trading volume should not be overlooked either. It is evident virtually all alternative markets are rising because Bitcoin\u2019s momentum has turned bullish again. There is nothing wrong with that picture, even though one would expect there to be some more \u201cgist\u2019 to these surges right now. As far as Qtum is concerned, nothing has happened behind the scenes as of late even though its value is rising in a spectacular fashion. Over the past few hours, the Qtum price has risen by 12% in USD value to $2.39. There is an additional 8.3% increase in QTUM/BTC, bringing that new level to 57,909 Satoshi. Both of these trends are very interesting to keep an eye on. While Qtum might mimic Bitcoin\u2019s chart rather closely, it does appear there is a bit more to this particular market than meets the eye. More specifically, most altcoins note half of their market cap in trading volume right now. Qtum, on the other hand, is going a different route. Its trading volume is over twice the size of the current market cap. That is rather exceptional even when the momentum turns bullish. Most of the volume comes from LBank, which represents 47% of all Qtum trades as of right now. On social media, the only Qtum-related discussions pertain to the current and future price. Gordon expects this inverted head and shoulder pattern to create more bullish QTUM momentum over the coming days Especially in the QTUM/BTC department, there may be some interesting developments on the horizon, assuming this chart is accurate. When it comes to the QTUM/USDT ratio, there is a very different outlook right now. While it seems there could be a breakout of some sorts over the course of this weekend, there is always a chance the momentum will take a turn for the worse. One never knows how crypto markets will behave, especially not the ones which heavily rely on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum. So far, it seems as if the Qtum uptrend could remain in place for a while. With this heavy trading volume, there is no imminent threat to the current price. However, one has to keep in mind this uptrend is the result of a lot of investors buying at a lower price. As such, it is likely some will take profits sooner rather than later. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

Today is no different in this regard, as the top markets have all turned bullish out of the blue once again. A very positive trend, especially for those who like to keep an eye on the NEM price. This altcoin is going through a rough patch right now, yet its price chart shows different momentum. It is always good to see the crypto markets flourish, especially during these weekends. Earlier weekends have displayed very bearish trends first and foremost, yet this one seems to be something else entirely. A lot of traders will be happy with how things are going right now. Especially NEM holders have been waiting to see the altcoin reach $0,05 again. So far, the currency is on track to do so. To put this in perspective, the most recent NEM price surge notes a 6.1% gain in USD value and a 3% increase in XEM/BTC. Because of these gains, one XEM is valued at $0.046 or 1,138 Satoshi. All of these signs seem to indicate there is a lot of bullish momentum brewing. Most of this excitement stems from Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing rise in value, though. When looking at the current price chart, it is evident there has been a very solid gain. Although this is the chart of this morning, and not the current one, the weekly trend has been bullish all along. Even the most recent setback yesterday failed to disrupt the trend, which seems to indicate this may be the beginning of an extended price run. XEM Hodl, on the other hand, sees this as the beginning of the major bull run. While this user clearly expects XEM to hit $1 at some point in the future, the altcoin would need a 20-fold increase in value to reach that level. Not impossible by any means, although it will require a lot more bullish pressure on Bitcoin to make something like that happen. Most of this current momentum seems to originate from the Japanese markets. That is not necessarily a big surprise, as XEM is a Japanese crypto project which is primarily traded across the Japanese exchanges. For the time being, there is a lot of positivity to go around, although this bullish run can easily be negated if Bitcoin goes into sideways trading once again. All of these market signals seem to confirm today will be a good day for all cryptocurrencies, tokens, and digital assets. NEM will not be an exception in this regard, which will please most of its holders and traders. After a rough period involving the Coincheck hack and a few other kerfuffles with the NEM Foundation, things have begun looking up again for the New Economy Movement project.

While that could pose a genuine problem for a fair few different markets, it seems Ontology is reaping the benefits right now. So much even that the Ontology price is genuinely turning bullish across the board, even though it had only seen strong gains just a few days ago. It is always good to see individual crypto markets perform quite well regardless of the overall circumstances. In the case of Ontology, one would expect the altcoin to lean on Bitcoin a fair bit more than it does right now. For holders and traders of this coin, there is a reason to be cautiously optimistic right now. The altcoin successfully bucks the bearish trend and its trading volume remains rather high for this currency. Keeping this push alive can push Ontology into the market cap top 20. Over the past few hours, the Ontology price surge has intensified quite spectacularly. With a 16% gain in both USD and BTC value, there is nothing to be overly concerned about. The ONT value has surpassed $0.90m and it now sits at just under 22,800 Satoshi. A very solid price run, especially when considering how the overall trading volume is holding its own as well, as $110m worth of OTN has changed hands. As one would expect, most of the discussions on social media pertain to the OTN value right now. CryptoScenario is keeping a close eye on the proceedings, which shows how interesting things have gotten. This user also expects a re-buy zone to materialize fairly soon, a sit seems this uptrend will run out of steam eventually. When that will happen, remains to be determined at this point. Daniel, on the other hand, is not looking for zones to rebuy ONT anytime soon. Instead, this user is more intent on seeing the price move up even further, as a 10% overnight gain is pretty interesting and hard to come by in the cryptocurrency world. Even so, this uber bullish ONT chart shows there will be a correction of some sorts sooner or later, and when it happens, the downfall will be quite steep. Dave Given is quite pleased with his ONT price prediction several days ago. The user expected ONT to hit $0.8 by Sunday, which was a bullish prediction in its own right. However, the value has now reached $0.9 on Saturday. For some traders and speculators, it is sometimes good to be wrong, especially where profits are concerned. However, the push to $1 is not necessarily complete as of yet, as that level will pose more hefty resistance. All of these signs seem to indicate there is some merit to the Ontology value rise over the past week and a half. As long as the trading volume keeps up with the price changes, there is a genuine reason this run will spill over to next week. The longer this run lasts, however, the bigger the chance of a major price correction. When that happens, things will not be pretty where ETN is concerned. For now, however, the positive momentum remains in place. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

Such a train of thought is very dangerous to pursue among traders who want to pocket some profits over the weekend. While the Ethereum Classic price appears bullish at this time, one has to keep in mind its value tends to go up and down quite often. As such, chasing the top can easily cause some financial headaches. In the cryptocurrency world, it is often difficult to determine what drives individual markets. While it is not uncommon for altcoins to derive value from Bitcoin and foremost, Ethereum Classic is seemingly a different creature in this regard. It too benefits fro bullish BTC momentum, although ETC usually does its own thing. Today is seemingly no exception in this regard. Over the past few hours, the Ethereum Classic price has risen by 6.6% to $4.77. Furthermore, there is a 5.8% gain over Bitcoin to bring that value to 0.0011986. Both of these trends are promising, yet they wouldn\u2019t materialize without good trading volume. ETC Notes $218.43m in volume today, which is nearly half of its overall market cap. It is rather interesting to note how the ETC-related discussions on Twitter are evolving right now. Saturn Network is sharing a handy video guide regarding building new tokens and ICOs on top of Ethereum Classic. While this option has existed for quite some time now, it remains to be determined whether or not anyone will make use of this method. It is also worth noting Ethereum Classic is currently live on the DEX trading platform. Although that is not the biggest exchange solution by any means, their list of support coins and tokens seems pretty solid. They also purposefully opted for not using Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoin but list TrueUSD instead. Very interesting, as it creates a different onramp for ETC as well. Last but not least, it would appear the ETC core developers are currently mulling whether they should integrate the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap in the future. That in itself is a very interesting topic of debate. This roadmap would introduce a lot of interesting upgrades to ETC, although no final decisions have been made at this time. Definitely something worth keeping an eye on. All of the developments behind the scenes appear to be working in favor of Ethereum Classic. That in itself is a bit of an unusual situation, although one many ETC holders will be quite pleased with.

More specifically, Ripple\u2019s native asset is still in the red in both USD and BTC value. In fact, there is a genuine chance the asset will drop below the 8,000 Satoshi level over the weekend. It is always a bit unusual to see how digital assets and cryptocurrencies follow different market trends more often than not. Whereas Bitcoin and Ethereum are trying to reclaim some lost value in quick succession, things are a bit different where XRP is concerned. This particular asset is still under pressure, although it successfully reclaimed the $0.321 level. To put this in perspective, the past few hours have not resulted in much exciting momentum for XRP. While the XRP price is down by just 0.2% in USD value, the XRP/BTC ratio has decreased by another 1%. This is not the trend traders and speculators are looking for whatsoever. Especially those who bought XRP in the hope of improving their BTC holders will not be too happy with how things are going. While the price momentum may not be too appealing, the XRP community remains versatile on social media. XareP is eager to point out how XRP is \u201cthe best digital asset\u201d. While it certainly better than some alternative solutions on the market, claiming it is the best outright may be a bit of a stretch. Even so, it would appear there is some merit to this statement as well. XRPPaynter, on the other hand, tries to point a finger of blame as Western Union and their current business model. The high transaction fees associated with this remittance solution are quite steep, especially for those who do not have access to traditional banking solutions or other financial tools. TheCryptoArtist, who is mainly interested in determining where the Bitcoin price is headed, remains somewhat bullish given the current circumstances. More specifically, he expects a major push to $4,500 in the next week, which is always interesting to keep an eye on. That bull run would also be quite interesting for XRP, although it may not necessarily benefit from this uptrend either. When looking at the bigger picture, one has to wonder what will come next for XRP. There is a genuine chance the USD value per XRP will rise again in the near future, simply because Bitcoin is rising in value. However, the XRP/BTC ratio, on the other hand, will potentially remain under a lot of pressure and drop below 8,000 Satoshi fairly quickly. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

For example, it is not possible to convert more than CHF 5,000 at this time. To put this in perspective, the MyEtherWallet team is working together with Bity to provide this functionality. More specifically, Bity is a Swiss brokerage firm which provides crypto services to its clients. While their focus primarily lies on Crypto ATMs, it would appear the integration with MEW brings their crypto-fiat gateway to anyone in the world. That also means users will not need access to one of the company\u2019s ATMs to obtain their cash. Some people may wonder how these companies can provide such a service without KYC verification. Especially in Europe, companies are forced to verify the identity of all their users these days. Bity is compliant with Switzerland\u2019s AMLA and uses \u201cproof of wallet ownership\u201d to remain compliant. A bit of a different approach to adhering to these guidelines, but it seems this cause no problems with the Swiss government so far. There is a minor bit of verification users will have to go through. Confirming they own a phone number is not the biggest hurdle in this industry. All Bity needs are the bank details, which will not be stored by the MyEtherWallet team. This functionality will be quite valuable to a lot of users. The main question is whether these limits can be lifted at some point in the future. It appears this limit applies to individual transactions, rather than a \u201chard cap\u201d per account. A lot of cryptocurrency users are looking for ways to bypass KYC requirements when converting Bitcoin and altcoins. At this time, MEW facilitates Bitcoin and Ethereum conversions to and from Euros and Swiss Francs. This is a very remarkable development for the crypto industry as a whole. Solutions like these are direly needed to attract more investors and speculators in the future.", "date": "2019-02-22T09:16:14+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 22}

Nearly all top markets are in the green, which is always a peculiar sight. As far as the Dogecoin price is concerned, the uptrend is still in effect. A push to $0.0021 may very well occur over the weekend. While it seemed as if the DOGE value would go on the retrace earlier today, things have turned out very differently once again. This is one of the strengths of the crypto industry throughout 2019 so far. Every frown is, quite literally, turned upside down. That was very different last year, when depression was a very commonly diagnosed trait among crypto traders. To put this in perspective, the Dogecoin price has turned somewhat bullish again. With a 21.% increase in USD value, one DOGE is now valued at $0.002072. There is also a 0.8% improvement in DOGE/BTC, bringing that value back to 52 Satoshi. It appears the 50 Satoshi support level has come through for Dogecoin, at least for now. There appears to be some genuine intrigue regarding Vitalik Buterin\u2019s Dogecoin holdings. He recently shared his crypto holdings with the world, and it appears he has never sold any Dogecoin in the process. In fact, he is allegedly looking to buy more, which is always a pretty interesting sight to behold. Diversification is key in this volatile industry, even for project developers. As has been the case for some time now, Dogecoin enthusiasts are always trying to keep the hype and momentum going. Notorious DOGE expects Bitcoin to hit $400,000 soon, at which point one DOGE would be valued at $1. It is a price level a lot of holders hope to see reached in their lifetime, albeit it seems unlikely that will be the case in the end. Furthermore, there is still a growing dismay regarding Coinbase\u2019s refusal to list DOGE on its platform. Fernando is wondering what needs to happen to ensure Dogecoin is listed on this popular exchange, as all previous efforts have seemingly fallen on deaf ears. Changing that narrative will not be easy whatsoever, as the company simply doesn\u2019t seem inclined to make this decision. All of the signs seem to confirm this Dogecoin uptrend can remain in place for a few more days to come. The weekend is around the corner which is always an exciting period for trading cryptocurrencies. While there is a chance things could turn slightly bearish again, there is no real reason to expect any major dips at this time. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Although the momentum has turned another bearish turn, it seems unlikely any real damage will be done in quick succession. The Electroneum price, on the other hand, is still trying to break free from the pack. A promising development for this currency, although the road ahead is still very long. It is pertinent for altcoins, tokens, and assets to not remain solely reliant on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum. Any self-respecting currency is, in theory, capable of breaking free from the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency at any given time. So far, very few of them have even tried to do so. Electroneum is the latest entry to join this list, although its weak trading volume may pose some problems in this regard. To put this in perspective, the Electroneum price has seen a healthy 1.5% increase in both USD and BTC value today. That in itself is pretty interesting, considering how Bitcoin is dipping in the red once again. Because of this minor gain, the value per ETN has risen to $0.007113, or 179 Satoshi. Both levels are pretty solid, at this time. Whether or not $288,400 worth of trading volume can keep things going, remains to be determined. There are some pretty interesting developments which are worth looking into. First of all, the Quorra Show will feature Electroneum\u2019s new product launch and the community reactions next Monday. That is something a lot of ETN users are looking forward to, as any cryptocurrency ecosystem needs to keep growing and evolving as time progresses. Secondly, it would appear Chris Gorman has joined the GSMA Intelligence Advisory Board. This will be crucial for the crypto project, as its strong focus on mobile can potentially shape a new future on a global scale. Having a representative on this Advisory Board can lead to some intriguing developments over the next few months and years. A very interesting development for ETN, although it may not necessarily impact the price directly. For those who are actively looking at the ETN/BTC price chart, it becomes evident today and tomorrow will be rather crucial. With ETN breaking the trend while Bitcoin is in a slump, there is something to look forward to. However, as long as the demand doesn\u2019t outweigh the supply, any potential progress will require a lot of effort. All of the signs seem to indicate the Electroneum momentum is still going strong. With all of this news and the potential video with reactions to look forward to on Monday, further positive momentum may continue to build. How this will affect the ETN value in the process. Bucking the overall bearish trend will not necessarily be all that easy, although ETN will not necessarily follow Bitcoin\u2019s momentum either. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While the Cardano price is not necessarily in the worst of places whatsoever, its current market momentum is not too promising either. For now, the $0.045 level is under a fair bit of pressure, although it remains to be seen if it will hold. One has to commend every alternative market which doesn\u2019t drop off a proverbial cliff every time Bitcoin dips into the red slightly. Although Bitcoin\u2019s pace will dictate the potential of other markets as well, it is pretty evident there is no reason for most alternative markets to drop off either. In the case of Cardano, the losses are a bit higher compared to BTC, but not necessarily all that spectacular either. Over the past 24 hours, the Cardano price has dropped by 2.2% in both USD and BTC value alike. This brings the value per ADA to $0.045362, or 1,139 BTC. Both levels appear to be rather solid support first and foremost, although it wouldn\u2019t take too much effort to send this alternative market either down or up. Its rather low trading volume can prove to be somewhat of a problem in this regard. In the cryptocurrency world, there is never a boring day without rumors or speculation. In the case of Cardano, there is a rumor ADA will be added to the Samsung Galaxy S10 lineup with its built-in crypto storage. While there is always a chance a development like this will effectively occur, there is no official confirmation by the company or any of its representatives so far. The real news this week comes in the form of Emurgo. This partner of Cardano has brought its Blockchain Academy Unit to India. To date, it remains unclear which role India will play in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain. Given the uneasy regulatory developments in that part of the world, this launch may not necessarily yield the big successes Cardano holders are hoping for. It is evident a lot of cryptocurrency users are looking at the current global financial situation with a bit of glee. Chad Stewart is a good example, as this user advises everyone to short the US Dollar and go long on Cardano. While that first part might make sense, the second part of his statement is not necessarily the best course of action. For the time being, there will not necessarily be any major uptrend for any market until Bitcoin recovers. Although it is overdue for some markets to detach themselves from BTC in this regard, it appears none of them is capable of effectively doing so. Changing that situation will take a lot of time and effort. As far as Cardano is concerned, a drop below $0.045 may prove rather troublesome for the coming days.

Yesterday seemed to be very bullish, whereas today is a lot more bearish for the majority of the top markets. The Litecoin price is still going quite strong, especially because it has finally surpassed the $50 barrier without too many problems. The year 2019 has offered something very different for most cryptocurrencies, tokens, and digital assets. A bit of an extensive bull run has shaped up in recent weeks, even though most markets currently show a bearish trend. Litecoin is one notable exception in this regard, as it simply continues to do its own thing without too many problems. A remarkable trend for a currency a lot of people gave up on a while ago. Over the past 24 hours, the Litecoin price has shown another bullish trend which results in a 5% gain. Because of this strong showing, one LTC is now priced at $50.89, which may be the top for a little while. The LTC/BTC ratio also remains bullish following another 5.2% increase. With a value of 0.0127BTC per Litecoin, everything is looking quite good. Similar to most other markets, Litecoin enjoys a hefty increase in overall trading volume. With $1.544bn worth of LTC changing hands, the demand for this altcoin appears to be genuine at this time. Most of the volume comes from OKEx and DigiFinex, two exchanges which mainly see traction in LTC/BTC and LTC/USDT pairs. The involvement of that stablecoin can be considered to be a sign of potential future growth. When it comes to holding and exchanging cryptocurrencies, different traders will deploy their own strategies. While some people exchange LTC to buy ERC20 tokens, DigiHODL prefers to hold on to LTC regardless of how green the grass may look elsewhere. So far, that strategy seems to be paying off quite well. For those who are looking at the actual price chart, it quickly becomes apparent there will be a very rough road ahead for Litecoin and Bitcoin alike. Although placing a short at 0.0129 BTC may have been a smart decision, the actual \u201cdrop\u201d is not as significant as some traders would have expected. As such, it may turn out to be a premature course of action. All things considered, Litecoin is one of the few remaining bullish top markets right now. That in itself tells quite an interesting story. The bearish pressure affecting Bitcoin is not making much of an impact on Litecoin or EOS right now.

All of the major currencies are going through an uptrend right now, which is always promising to see. Surprisingly, it seems the Holo price is still in the red despite some new developments taking place behind the scenes. In the cryptocurrency world, there is never any certainty in terms of value development. While it is possible most markets will follow Bitcoin\u2019s momentum, there will always be some exceptions to this unwritten rule. Whereas most markets are moving up, some of the more popular altcoins are still struggling first and foremost. In the case of the Holo price, it is evident there is still a lot of work to be done. More specifically, the value has dropped even further in the past few hours, even though there wasn\u2019t necessarily a reason for this downtrend. Because of the most recent 4% drop, one HOT is now valued at $0.0014, or 35 Satoshi. Holo is also giving up 6.3% over Ethereum, which is even more problematic. There is always some good news in the cryptocurrency world users need to be aware of. For Holo fans, the big news is how MetaMorph.pro is now officially supporting this altcoin. Although this might not necessarily have any impact on the price whatsoever, it is still a very intriguing development, all things concerned. For those who want a more technical analysis of the current market momentum, the 35 Satoshi level may not remain in play for very long. More specifically, Hakan Aykanat is confident this is a \u201cdangerous level\u201d which will need to act as support. However, it remains to be determined if that actually will happen. Falling below 35 Sats will undoubtedly cause some further bearish pressure. Despite the bearish pressure, it would appear as if some traders and speculators remain confident things will improve from here on out. More specifically, Fat Elvis is convinced the dip is in and people should have stocked up by now. Others see this as a bagholder trying to offload his remaining coins at a less steep loss. Advice like this should never be taken to heart whatsoever, as this is Twitter, after all. All of this seems to indicate there may be further bearish pressure on Holo for quite some time to come. With all of these losses in USD, BTC, and ETH value alike, it is evident things are not necessarily looking too great. At the same time, all other markets are bullish once again, thus it would appear to be a matter of time until Holo follows suit. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Today is once again one of those days where no project seems to note real gains. One interesting exception is the VeChain price. Despite some hourly bearish pressure, its overall price trend remains intact. It is always interesting to see how the different alternative markets handle Bitcoin\u2019s bearish momentum. As can be seen on the market cap tracking sites, most of them are not doing too well right now. In the top 15, VeChain is the only notable exception in this regard. Its uptrend is still intact, primarily because the altcoin continues to gain in BTC value. Over the past 24 hours, the VeChain price has risen by 5% in USD value and nearly 6% in BTC value. Because of these gains, the VET price sits at $0.004547, or 115 Satoshi. That in itself is pretty remarkable for many different reasons, primarily because the overall industry trend is anything but positive or stable right now. On social media, there is no shortage of people trying to explain the benefits of VeChain, Pablo Wilco goes as far as directly addressing Elon Musk in terms of using VeChain for Tesla-oriented ventures. A bit of a bold move first and foremost, although those who dare take some risks often achieve success. For now, musk has not responded to this \u201cchallenge\u201d as of yet. Scott has seemingly missed all of the recent crypto winter, for some unknown reason. While it is true VET hit an ATH that was much higher at one point, those days are long gone. The current value of below $0.005 is not instilling much confidence in that regard. However, it seems the ATH of $10 is not entirely accurate either. That figure only comes to surface where long-term price speculation is concerned. Br1ght Eyes seemingly has no shortage of positive thoughts where the VET price is concerned. Although this token has yet to reach $0.005 again, this user expects the momentum to top out near $0.0053. A bold prediction, given the overall market momentum. Even so, if VeChain bucks the overall trend, that price point may not be ludicrous either. For the time being, no one should dump everything into VeChain in search of quick profits. While the altcoin is still going strong, it seems unlikely it will buck the bearish pressure for a long time. Additionally, VET has rather bleak trading volume, which may prove insufficient to sustain the uptrend. Reaching $0.005 will seemingly not occur today.

An ongoing bearish trend is wreaking a bit of havoc among most of the alternative markets right now. While most top markets are trying to hold their own, the Stellar price is giving up a lot of ground. This appears to be a continuation of a one-month downtrend which will not relent. Although it has become somewhat quiet on the Stellar Lumens front, it would appear the price continues to decline as of late. For people who have been looking at XLM for more than a few days, this will not come as much of a surprise. This downtrend has been in effect for over a month now, ever since traders lost control over the $0.1 level. Even the most recent market revival has not kept the XLM value afloat for very long. This became apparent in the past few hours, as the Stellar price has dropped by another 3% in USD value, to $0.088. In XLM/BTC, there is also a 2.4% decline, as one XLM is now priced at 2,234 Satoshi. It is evident this asset is not doing too well, and its trading volume is seemingly not picking up either. On social media, it quickly becomes apparent some interesting discussions are taking place. Some people are actively discussing how old or new the XLM technology really is. According to Electra-Highway, the initial protocol is based on eight-year-old technology, which is not what most people would expect. However, that doesn\u2019t automatically make it better or worse than some of its competitors on the market today. Coinogaritma, on the other hand, is currently looking at the price chart from a slightly different perspective. More specifically, this trader wonders how long it will take until XLM begins heading in a specific direction. For now, it is evident this can easily swing either way, primarily because the bearish pressure on Bitcoin will not relent anytime soon. For those traders who simply want to pocket some profits and not worry about much else, triangular arbitrage will have one covered first and foremost. There is one interesting triangular arbitrage option involving HST, XLM, and a few different exchanges. This opportunity can net a potential profit of up to 42.8%, which is quite a spectacular amount under bearish circumstances. All of the market signs seem to indicate today will not see much of a market reversal right away. The one positive side is how Bitcoin\u2019s downfall is kept to an absolute minimum, even though alternative markets tend to lose a ton of value regardless. For XLM, the lack of an increased trading volume, combined with further XLM/BTC losses, can prove to be somewhat problematic. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

As Bitcoin remains in the red, the vast majority of alternative markets is dragged down as well. The NEO price, for example, is losing a lot of ground across the board. It remains to be seen if its value can remain above $8.5 for much longer. Even though Bitcoin is keeping its losses to a bare minimum right now, the same cannot be said for most altcoins on the market. NEO, for example, is losing four times as much value as Bitcoin, which shows how tough the times have gotten for all markets all of a sudden. Even though NEO has ample trading volume, it appears most people are intent on selling. To put this in perspective, the NEO price has lost 5.5% in USD value and 4.8% against Bitcoin over the past few hours. This is in stark contrast to some bullish momentum which had begun forming earlier this week. Even so, no uptrend can be sustained indefinitely especially not in this volatile industry. As such, this may very well be the beginning of a steep downtrend for NEO. Social media is always an interesting source for information pertaining to any cryptocurrency. Christoph K wouldn\u2019t mind seeing the Vienna University of Economics and Business run a validator node for the NEO blockchain. While not necessarily impossible, one has to keep in mind they are only running a Bitcoin node right now and have no plans to expand upon this functionality. It would also appear a few projects are migrating from NEO onto other blockchain projects these days. The latest to do so is Effect.AI, a decentralized platform for artificial intelligence. They are also starting the #NEOtoEOS hashtag trend, which is not necessarily something to many people will appreciate. However, companies and projects need to do what is best for their particular needs. Outside of directly buying and holding NEO, there are other ways to make money as well. Arbitrage trading can usually be very lucrative where altcoins are concerned, In NEO\u2019s case, there is just one interesting opportunity, but it is one that can make nearly 1% in profit per trade. Not a bad profit by any means, especially under these bearish market circumstances. For the time being, it is unclear how the NEO chart will evolve over the coming days. As the weekend draws near, it is always difficult to make sense of the markets.

Although Bitcoin is seemingly stuck in sideways trading right now, the EOS price is moving up pretty quickly. With another 7.5% gain in the bag, the push to $4 is seemingly still in progress as of right now. While Bitcoin is not entirely sure which direction to head in right now, the rest of the markets are still giving it their all. More specifically, the EOS value is rising at a quick pace, which further confirms there is a genuine interest in this particular altcoin. Although this uptrend has been in place since last week, it would appear things are still following the same path. Over the past few hours, there has been another EOS price increase of 7.5%. In the process, the USD value of this altcoin has now risen to $3.88, which seems to indicate the $4 level will come into play sooner or later. In terms of EOS/BTC, there is a 6.4% increase to bring the value to 97,259 Satoshi. Both of these trends are impressive in their own right. What is even more interesting is how the overall EOS trading volume has risen to over $2bn. On social media, there is some genuine excitement for this altcoin. Crypto Sign confirms EOS is one of the strongest rises today, primarily because of its solid gains in USD value. While this trend is very interesting to take note of, one has to wonder how much of this is bullish momentum and how much is just speculation to obtain more BTC. That is always the big question when it comes to altcoins. Yim, who is slowly becoming somewhat of a notorious EOS bull on Twitter, looks at the current price level and looks for even bigger gains. Although this most recent uptrend is already quite steep, there will ultimately be a pullback regardless. Even so, this user is confident those pullback areas are merely designed to accumulate more EOS, more than anything else. As has been the case for quite some time now, there are always arbitrage opportunities to take advantage of. In the case of EOS, there is seemingly only one decent opportunity, but it is still a pretty interesting one to keep an eye on. With a potential profit of 1.3%, the option should not be overlooked whatsoever. All things considered, the current overall EOS market momentum still appears to be pretty bullish. Although the previous gain was met with a brief dip eventually, it would appear that negative momentum has been thrown out of the window. As such, it is a matter of time until $4 is reached.

In the case of VeChain, it seems things are heading in the wrong direction following some bearish momentum. So much even that the VeChain price is on its way to potentially head below 100 Satoshi once again. It is always interesting to see how quickly some altcoins give up ground when the Bitcoin price goes through a bit of bearish pressure. Whereas this would be a signal for altcoins to gain on Bitcoin, very few of them are capable of doing so. In the case of VeChain, it appears things are not going too well right now, although this may only be a temporary setback. Over the past few hours, the VeChain price lost 3.4% in both USD and BTC value alike. This is not the trend speculators and holders are looking for at this time. After all, most people expected the bear market to be finally over. Nothing could be further from the truth, though, primarily because there was never any indication all top markets had broken to key resistance levels in a definitive manner. On Twitter, it would appear there is some pretty big news for VET. More specifically, it would appear VeChain, together with MyStory, has been highlighted briefly on Italian tv channel RAI1. While this could have exposed millions of viewers to this new technology, it remains to be seen how many people effectively watched it in the first place. Still, a pretty interesting development for VeChain. Moreover, it would appear the recent addition of VeChain to the Amazon AWS platform is also getting a lot of attention lately. Enterprises looking to experiment with blockchain technology now have even more options at their disposal. A one-click-deploy option will always make projects like these more accessible. Regardless of the current market momentum, it would appear the majority of community members are not too bothered by how things are going right now.

For those who like to watch the Binance Coin price, today is an exceptionally good day. This token has risen by another 14% as its value surpassed $11 again. It is only normal the alternative markets benefit from this ongoing Bitcoin bull run. While it is only normal some coins see bigger gains than others, Binance Coin is checking a lot of the right boxes for traders and speculators. So much even that it is quickly rising in value without facing too much resistance. Those gains can be noted all across the board, which makes this latest run even more impressive. Over the past few hours, there has been a 14% increase where the Binance Coin price is concerned. As such, one BNB is now valued at $11.02, a value which has been reached a few times in the past. There is also a 12% gain in both BTC and ETH value, which is what most traders will be looking for. After all, most people own altcoins and tokens to increase their Bitcoin or Ether holdings over time. Yellowbee, while pleased with the bull trend, is not too certain this will remain in play for very long. Until Bitcoin breaks the $4,000 resistance in a decisive manner, there is a chance this entire uptrend will collapse. If that would be the case, currencies such as Binance Coin can see some major repercussions because of it. Cryptonia, on the other hand, seemingly expects big things from BNB in the coming days. Considering how this token closed below resistance last week and turned very bullish shortly after, the market can swing in either direction without much effort. If the bull run continues, a further push to $15 is certainly plausible, albeit not necessarily possible. Crypto Mori acknowledges he has a serious issue when it comes to cryptocurrencies. More specifically, this user has a compulsive altcoin buying disorder when green candles materialize. Most traders try to cost average down their investments, yet this user seems to hoard and accumulate only when gains materialize. A bit of a unique trading strategy, although one with serious risks attached as well. It is anything but surprising to see Binance Coin gain value when all other markets are moving up. As BNB is not just a tool to reduce fees on Binance, this price increase will be quite telling. It may help determine whether or not people are effectively spending this token as a currency for goods and services. Higher prices usually get people spending, thus the commerce side of cryptocurrency might receive a healthy boost if this keeps up. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

This occurs either by copying its code or blatantly copying the Bitcoin name. In the case of Ethereum, its own forked currency has not been performing too well. In fact, the Ethereum Classic price has been all but forgotten about until this most recent uptrend began taking shape. Although there was some initial excitement regarding Ethereum Classic, that has all but evaporated in the process. Not entirely surprising by any means, but it is evident this is not what the community had envisioned first and foremost. Even so, when it comes to making money through random and unexpected pump cycles, Ethereum Classic is still worth keeping an eye on at any given moment. Over the past few hours, it quickly became apparent the Ethereum Classic price follows Bitcoin\u2019s momentum. Although the 12% increase in value is significant, the ETC price still sits at just $4.75. That is a long way removed from its all-time high. In terms of ETC/BTC, a 6.7% increase has formed which pushes that ratio to 0.0012 BTC again. With $338m in trades, it would appear the forked version of Ethereum is holding its own. On social media, any discussion pertaining to ETC comes off as forced more often than not. O.G. Pharaoh, for example, offers some pretty unusual investment advice. According to this user, ETC will need to reach a new all-time high soon. Even under these bullish circumstances, it seems unlikely such an all-time high can materialize in the near future. One can always hope, though. This same user takes his advice one step further by telling users how they should invest in things which can be \u201cbeneficial to their life\u201d. The choices offered include gold, copper, and Ethereum Classic. A very odd and forced sentiment to get some Tweets out pertaining to ETC these days. This is not necessarily the kind of attention this project needs. For those users who genuinely do not want to hold onto Ethereum Classic for too long, exploring arbitrage options is always a viable alternative. This is one area ETC excels at on a regular basis. Even today, there is some good money to be made with this altcoin in that particular department. As the volume of this altcoin remains relatively high, it should not pose too many problems to make good things happen in terms of profits. As is always the case in cryptocurrency, nothing is ever set in stone. While it is good to see most of the top 20 markets note some solid growth all of a sudden, it seems too good to be true from a long-term perspective. How this will play out for Ethereum Classic, is very difficult to guess. The market is a very unusual one in every way, and it is possible its momentum has no real ties with other markets at this time. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While the momentum is positive, most markets tend to follow the overall trend. With a bit of bearish pressure, most projects are declining rapidly. The Electroneum price, on the other hand, is trying to move up again and reclaim its spot in the market cap top 60. With a lot of bullish market momentum over the past few days, it is only normal there would be some sort of reprieve at some point. While that reprieve results in medium-sized losses for most of the altcoins, tokens, and assets on the market, some other projects will buck the trend. Electroneum appears to be one of those projects, as it is carving out some fresh gains despite overarching bearish momentum. To put this in perspective, it would appear the Electroneum price managed to gain 1.2% in USD value and 1% on Bitcoin. Because of these minor uptrends, the value per ETN has risen to $0.0072 once again. In terms of ETN/BTC, the ratio sits at 182 Satoshi. A push too 200 Satoshi would be rather bullish, albeit it seems unlikely to happen anytime soon. Twitter is abuzz with discussions pertaining to Electroneum, and seemingly for good reason. More specifically, it appears the mobile app \u2013 which introduced cloud mining a while ago \u2013 will get a new feature. Through that feature, users will be able to top up airtime or mobile data with ETN. An interesting concept, although it remains to be seen what this will entail exactly. In terms of getting listed on a new exchange, the DynX Exchange voting is still ongoing at this time. Although it seems as if Electroneum has lost some ground in the vote itself, that situation can still be rectified. Nourdin believes ETN will make a comeback and beat its competitors with relative ease. A bit of an optimistic outlook, albeit one never knows what might happen. When looking at the actual ETN price chart, a very interesting image becomes apparent. The ETNBTC chart looks as if there will be some serious resistance between now and 200 Satoshi. There is also no reason to expect any bullish outbreak right now, as slow and steady will win the race. Even so, ET will hit its stride eventually, either for better or worse. All of these signs point toward a minor push for Electroneum which may eventually result in sideways trading for a while. It is obvious all crypto markets need a breather right now, yet Electroneum is trying to push the pace in this regard. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but all traders and speculators need to keep their expectations in check first and foremost.", "date": "2019-02-20T08:45:36+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 20}

Dogecoin is one of the first to do so, which may come as a surprise to a lot of people. Although the losses are not even all that significant, the Dogecoin price is slowly turning bearish. Especially the DOGE/BTC ratio remains under a lot of pressure, for the time being. In the cryptocurrency world, bearish hourly Bitcoin charts can spell trouble for altcoins, regardless of their total market cap. Although a bearish hourly candle seems more than warranted after the recent gains, it is already spelling trouble for Dogecoin. The meme currency of the internet is losing ground across the board. A dip below $0.002 may not necessarily occur, although it will be tight. In the past hour or two, the Dogecoin price declined by 0.4% to bring its value to $0.002081. What is of more concern, however, is how DOGE/BTC continues to face immense pressure. With another 2.25% drop in that department, the 52 Satoshi level will need to act as thorough support right now. Only time will tell whether it can fulfill that role or not. As one would come to expect, the negative price pressure isn\u2019t exactly a hot topic on social media yet just. Adem BCD sees an interesting few hours ahead for DOGE/USD, although it is anyone\u2019s guess as to where the value will head next. If Bitcoin turns bearish as well, the losses can start to pile up incredibly quickly. One rather interesting topic of debate is whether or not there is any upcoming development for Dogecoin. While the obvious answer would be negatory, it might not sit well with some members of the community. As such, some clarity on this front would be appreciated. It is unclear what type of feature Dogecoin really needs, as the brand does just fine in its current form. It has been at least a full day since someone last mentioned Dogecoin isn\u2019t on Binance. That streak has now been broken, courtesy of David Love Doge. This enthusiast claims Binance, while it may become the Amazon of crypto, will not be the \u201cPrime Binance\u201d without Dogecoin. An interesting sentiment, although it won\u2019t get DOGE listed on this exchange any faster either. All of these signs seem to indicate some rough times may be ahead for Dogecoin. While that is nothing new for this altcoin whatsoever, it comes at a bit of an odd time. If all markets resume their uptrend later in the week, it will be interesting to see what happens to DOGE.

Surprisingly, it seems the momentum surrounding Ethereum has shifted to XRP a bit. Following some very strong gains, the XRP price continues to rise and could even hit $0.35 this week. There is also a small uptrend in XRP/BTC, which will please a lot of speculators. Yesterday was a bit of an odd day for the XRP fans. Although Bitcoin and Ethereum showed plenty of bullish momentum, Ripple\u2019s native asset saw very little change, all things considered. It now appears Ethereum is taking a bit of a break, whereas the value of XRP is moving up all of a sudden. A very interesting development, given the circumstances, but one that will keep people engaged for some time to come. To put this in perspective, the past 24 hours have been very positive for the XRP price. Following a fresh 7.1% gain, the USD value per XRP has now risen to $0.335668. In terms of XRP/BTC, things are finally moving up once again. Although the 2.8%$ increase is not necessarily very spectacular, it does bring the overall ratio back to 8,513 Satoshi. Positive trends all across the board. On social media, it is evident there is a lot of excitement. Whether or not that is misguided sentiment, will have to become apparent in the coming days. TheCryptoArtist claims Bitcoin has officially entered its next bull run. That also means all other markets, including XRP, will have a good time in the next few weeks. Dark Horse Rider sees things in a different spotlight, although he also remains very bullish. More specifically, this user claims XRP will only go forward. That remains to be determined, as there is always a chance the entire ecosystem will fall apart. While no one genuinely hopes to see that happen, it is a possibility that can never be ignored. The prospect of future gains should never make investors or speculators blind to the potential risks. For those who are mainly interested in the actual XRP price chart, it quickly becomes apparent anything can happen. The XRP/USD ratio has seemingly completed its head and shoulder pattern which should result in further upward momentum. Reaching the $0.6 level may not necessarily happen anytime soon, but it is a potential long-term target for investors to keep an eye on. All things considered, it would appear the XPR momentum is finally heating up a bit. When even this market turns bullish and follows the overall trend, an interesting few days lie ahead. While the overall crypto trading volume continues to rise, all it would take is one bit of negative mainstream media news to create another downfall. For now, such news bits have remained elusive, but it is apparent one of them will show up sooner or later. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

All markets are seemingly flying off the handle in a positive manner. If the EOS price is any indication, things will get even more interesting over the coming days and weeks. Its strong gains push the price well beyond the $3 mark in quick succession. It is always interesting to see how different cryptocurrencies, assets, and tokens handle bullish Bitcoin price pressure. For most projects, this usually results in net losses in BTC value, which can easily keep the USD-based gains in check. EOS is a rather interesting exception as of right now, as its bullish momentum is obliterating USD and BTC levels alike. Over the past few hours, the EOS price has risen to $3.48 after a monster 23% increase in value. Although the EOS/BTC ratio is less bullish, the 13.5% increase cannot be overlooked by any means either. All of these signs show how things have evolved in this industry as of late. Its trading volume also sits at $1.77bn, which is very unusual for EOS. While it is always advisable to keep a level head in this industry, one has to keep in mind this recent gain gets people genuinely excited. Fabi Yamada still expects EOS to hit $5 at some point. Based on the current value, the trading volume, and how easily these gains materialized, it might not even be out of the question either. Although cryptocurrencies are often very complex for novice users, there is a lot of useful information to be found on the internet. Soup shared a recent video as to how EOS works an what one needs to know in a nutshell. It is far from a complete guide to properly understanding every facet, but it is still worth checking out. Crypto Phenom seemingly doesn\u2019t know how to make sense of all of this bullish momentum. Considering how EOS \u2013 among others \u2013 have seen a trading volume worth half of its market cap, it is evident the golden days of crypto are not that far away. Even so, one has to wonder how much of the entire crypto volume is real and how much artificial these days. For OS, most of the volume comes from Bit-Z and OKEx, which is interesting to keep an eye on. As has been the case in this volatile industry, uptrends are usually met with a fair bit of resistance and corrections. Whether or not that will spoil this party sooner or later, has yet to be determined. Anything is possible in this industry, but no one should get ahead of themselves because of a bullish day.

Thousands of alternative projects exist today, albeit not all of them will be viable for very long. Netflix is seemingly in the process of filming a documentary about the altcoins on the market. A remarkable development, although it can complement their existing Bitcoin documentary. No one can fault Netflix for continually increasing its number of original productions. The popular global streaming service has funded movies, stand-up comedy shows, tv shows, documentaries, and even anime series in recent years. When their initial Bitcoin documentary was announced, the majority of cryptocurrency enthusiasts remained rather skeptical. That in itself is not surprising. Bitcoin has not received the best of receptions when it used for documentaries or tv shows. Instead, it seems most productions are focusing on the negative side of cryptocurrency. The Netflix documentary, which goes by the name of Banking on Bitcoin, has received some positive reviews. Although there is some information in the production which can be considered confidential, at least Netflix tried to tell the whole story instead of just a part of it. Although not much is known about the altcoin documentary, some images have surfaced on Reddit. One of those images depicts the set where this documentary is allegedly being filed. It will mention the likes of PACCoin, Global Boost, and a few others. No one knows for sure which currencies were select or what the selection procedure involved exactly. Given the vast number of altcoins, there is a lot of potential content waiting to be covered. As was somewhat to be expected, this topic raises a lot of questions. While it would be interesting to see an altcoin documentary which is produced by professionals, one also has to wonder what the potential repercussions would be. The altcoin industry ever-changing. Projects which are relevant today may disappear in the next six months. Creating an altcoin documentary which can transcend that aspect will pose many different challenges for Netflix. Some Reddit users also claim this documentary is expected to air on the video streaming service by 2020. It is evident there is a long way to go before such a video project can even be deemed worthy to air on Netflix. Others claim this will be an eight-part series, rather than just one 90 or 120-minute documentary. Until the company officially confirms any of it, there are plenty of details to speculate about for the foreseeable future. Given how all altcoins lost a ton of value since late 2017, the timing of this documentary may not necessarily be the best either. There are a lot of bag holders and investors who are genuinely on edge about the industry as a whole. If this video production comes out the wrong way, it may very well trigger a lot of bearish pressure on altcoins. For some Reddit users, that is exactly what they are waiting for.

It is an interesting sight to behold, even though most people agree this uptrend will not last indefinitely. As far as the XRP is concerned, the current gains look very appealing. However, this asset will not reclaim the $2 market cap spot in the near future at this rate. Over the past few weeks, a very peculiar XRP trend has become apparent. Even if this asset were to gain USD value, it seems incapable of support its ratio against Bitcoin in any meaningful manner. Although no major dips have occurred in XRP/BTC, it is evident something will need to change sooner or later. For now, this uneasy situation remains in place. Over the past few hours, the XRP price has seen some rather bullish momentum. With a 7.2% gain in the books, the value per XRP has now risen to $0.322 again. In terms of XRP/BTC, things are not looking all that great. A 0.7% decrease is nothing to lose sleep over. However, it seems unlikely the asset will retake 8.500 Satoshi again, let alone 9,000 Satoshi. As is usually the case, there is some excitement regarding XRP as of right now. KobusLouw sees a lot of bullish signals where this asset is concerned. As all of the \u201cstars are aligned\u201d, one has to wonder how this week will evolve. If this is indeed the beginning of a major bull run for all markets, good times lie ahead. DPC Research is looking at XRP/USD at this time. Following those 7.2% gains, that is not entirely abnormal. However, it seems a major breakout is looming on the horizon, assuming history will repeat itself where this asset is concerned. It is too early to say for sure, though, as there is so much [positive] volatility to take into account. For those traders who do not own XRP but still want to take advantage of the current price changes, arbitrage trading has one covered. The value per XRP is different between several exchanges right now, which is only to be expected. The potential profit per trade is also more than acceptable, especially when considering how nearly all of the involved platforms should have sufficient liquidity. Although most other markets see a massive increase in trading volume, XRP remains a bit behind. With $870m in trades, there is no reason for concern. However, this asset has seen many days of trading between $1bn and $2bn per day.

For the time being, it seems as if Holo is checking the right boxes and may even retake the 40 Satoshi level in the coming days. In the cryptocurrency world, nothing is ever certain or guaranteed. Anything can and potentially will happen when people least suspect it. As far as Holo is concerned, it seems the underpinning ecosystem is finally starting to hit its stride. While there is always plenty of work to be done, one has to acknowledge the developers are effectively come through on their initial promises. That is not always a given where altcoins are concerned.

There is also a 2.5% gain in HOT/BTC, which pushes that particular value back to 39 Satoshi. A further push to 40 Satoshi and above is not entirely out of the question, although it will not necessarily happen automatically. In terms of developing the underpinning Holochain ecosystem, a big change looms on the horizon. More specifically, there is a Holochain-Rust package in development which should strengthen the ties between this project and the Firefox browser. Although this development has hit a few minor roadblocks, it should be coming to market fairly soon. Jason Faraday is not too bothered about the current market momentum. While it would always be better to walk away from all of this with a profit of some sort, it doesn\u2019t really matter much to this individual for some reason. Instead, he is just keen to be part of something that may change the world as people know it today. A remarkable sentiment, especially because Holo has been making traders a ton of money lately. When looking at the actual HOT price chart, it would appear things are getting pretty interesting.

A bit of a surprising development, but a positive market development nonetheless. The Cardano price is still noting strong gains, following its recent 11% uptrend. If this momentum remains in place the $0.05 price level should be reached fairly soon. It is evident there are many different types of momentum within the cryptocurrency industry. Although it is obvious most markets need a bullish Bitcoin price trend first and foremost, the current gains are pretty interesting regardless. Cardano, for example, is rising in value fairly quickly all of a sudden, primarily because it successfully improves its position over Bitcoin. Over the past 24 hours, the Cardano price has noted a very impressive rise in value of 11.4%. This brings the current price to $0.0477, which means $0.05 is not that far away either. In terms of ADA/BTC, it appears there is a 5.9% uptrend to take note of as well. Both trends confirm the bullish crypto market momentum is not necessarily going away anytime soon. There is some genuine excitement regarding Cardano on social media as well. On the surface, this has everything to do with the recent price increase first and foremost. Ryuzaki is confident this is the bull run people have been waiting for. Similar momentum seems to affect some other top altcoins as well, which can lead to either further gains or a massive decline. It would appear the current ADA price chart is getting a lot of attention, which is only to be expected at this point. With Bitcoin giving all markets a helping hand, it is somewhat normal to see the top markets gain over 10% without too many problems. Even so, this is not a push to the moon whatsoever, as there is still a lot of room for a possible reversal. Especially where ADA/BTC is concerned, it would appear things can get pretty interesting over the coming hours and days. More specifically, it seems the first level has already been reached in this regard, which can easily indicate some profit taking will occur fairly soon. If and when that happens, it seems logical to assume the Cardano value might take somewhat of a hit. For the time being, there is so much green across all charts one has to wonder if this is a dream. However, it appears this is a form of market reversal which has been long overdue. As long as the momentum remains positive, there will be further gains across the board.

As far as Basic Attention Token is concerned, things are looking pretty good right now. Following a nice 5% gain, the current Basic Attention Token price sits at $0.13. A remarkable trend, although the token is getting a lot of new fans every week. In the cryptocurrency world, there are always some surprising market trends which might not necessarily make too much sense. In the case of BAT, its heavy ties with Coinbase and Coinbase Earn are seemingly paving the way for regular minor price spikes. Additionally, the Brave browser is quite a powerful tool when used correctly, even though it will not become most people\u2019s go-to solution just yet. In the past few hours, there was some bearish momentum forming where Bitcoin is concerned. This has not caused any problems where the Basic Attention Token price. With a 5% gain in USD and BTC value, the price has risen to $0.134 or 3,703 Satoshi. There is also a 2% gain over Ethereum, which can always be worth keeping an eye on. Finding social media discussions pertaining to BAT is not necessarily all that easy. Hyper is quite pleased with how Coinbase is giving away both BAT and ZCash through their Earn platform. Whether or not more currencies and associated giveaways will follow suit, is a very different matter altogether. The current chart for Basic Attention Token price also shows some pretty interesting trends. While this wild ride is seemingly far from over, there is a chance the BAT/USD ratio will continue to improve for the foreseeable future. Golf Nut is an ambitious trader in this regard, as he expects this run to continue for quite some time to come. Rebranded Inverse Biff is also quite smitten by BAT and how its value has performed. It is always interesting to see tokens link up with actual use cases which can easily transcend the existing cryptocurrency community. That doesn\u2019t automatically mean its value will continue to go up, though, as every uptrend is met with a correction eventually. Most of the BAT holders, traders, and speculators will be pleased with these most recent proceedings where this token is concerned. It is evident there is genuine positivity where the token is concerned, even though there is a very, very long way to go until the Brave browser becomes mainstream. Until that happens, BAT will not be able to achieve its full potential either. The foundation, which is currently being developed, seemingly becomes more solid every month, though.

Even though Bitcoin has paved the way in this regard, one wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect all markets to follow suit. The Storj price shows things can be done very differently without too much effort. despite its huge gains, it seems rather unlikely this uptrend can be sustained for very long. When Bitcoin bleeds just the tiniest bit of value, alternative markets will usually lose twice to thrice as much ground. Not just in USD value, but also in their individual ratio with Bitcoin, which only further compounds losses. In the case of Storj, however, the uptrend is firming up rather nicely, although some of the gains have been wiped out pretty quickly already. To put this in perspective, the Storj price has gained a stunning 46% in both USD and BTC value. In doing so, the price per STORJ is brought to $0.2814, or 7,760 Satoshi. STORJ Is also traded against Ethereum, where it gained just over 42% in the past few hours. It is quite interesting to note how there is also a high amount of overall trading volume, which is rather uncanny for this particular market at any given time. On social media, it would appear there is a lot of focus on Storj because of the price gains alone. Crypto Gulp confirms this token is the strongest riser in the past 24 hours, but it is evident this will not necessarily last all that long. After all, the increase in trading volume will cause a lot of people to cash out any profits regardless of how steep or small they may be. When looking at the actual price chart, it would appear the 1-week chart does not look all that promising. In fact, there is a genuine chance this volume increase will not be sufficient to keep the Storj value near any of the current levels. It will certainly be interesting to see how this market looks in 24 hours from now. For those who are uncomfortable with the current Storj value increase, there is a healthy triangular arbitrage opportunity to explore for quick profits as well. Although it involves the use of EXMO to convert the funds to BTC again in the end, one has to put in a bit of effort to achieve a 78% profit per trade. For speculators, this will certainly be a worthwhile option to look into. One has to keep in mind no massive uptrend in the cryptocurrency world will remain in place for very long. That is especially true when it involves smaller cap altcoins or projects which suddenly see a massive value increase for no apparent reason. In the case of Storj, it is evident there is a genuine chance most, if not all of these gains will be wiped out fairly quickly. When that happens, a lot of users will be left holding big bags.

In most cases, there is a minor uptrend where Bitcoin is concerned, with some altcoins, tokens, or assets noting surprisingly big gains. As far as the Dogecoin price is concerned, the current gains are acceptable. The bigger development is how the value per DOGE has hit $0.002 once again. It has been coming for some time now, but all markets are going through a healthy rebound. Although the overall momentum is still a bit subdued in some cases, it would appear there is genuine excitement brewing behind the scenes. When even Dogecoin retakes critical levels to turn them into future support, one knows this trend may not necessarily calm down anytime soon. Over the past few hours, the value per Dogecoin has risen by just over 2.1%. As such, the Dogecoin price sits at $0.002027 once again. In terms of DOGE/BTC, however, things are looking a bit bleak. A fresh 0.9% loss will cause some dismay, although the 54 Satoshi level is still in place at this time. For the time being, it seems this trend can be maintained with relative ease, which is all Dogecoin enthusiasts have asked for. On social media, there is a lot of interest regarding the current Dogecoin market cap. Considering how this altcoin has had a market cap of $300m a while ago, some people expect that level to be reached again following this uptrend. For now, the project is valued at $239.85m, although it appears that value may continue to creep up in the coming days. It is also worth noting how the DogePal service has received yet another critical update. This service continues to make it easier for users and retailers to work with Dogecoin in any possible scenario. The latest updates include a commerce summary page, as well as API support for developers to look into. As this service continues to grow and expand, it can pave the way for broader DOGE adoption. As is always the case, Dogecoin is perhaps best known for its memes. The Dogecoin Memes Twitter account shared a pretty funny one this morning which will cause a fair few chuckles along the way. It is evident Dogecoin tends to attract a lot of people from all over the world. As such, there will undoubtedly be some truth to the meme, especially when the price is going up. All of the signs seem to indicate this overall crypto uptrend may remain in place for some time to come. Bar a few minor exceptions, it appears most markets note small and steady growth, rather than seeing their value explode and collapse in quick succession. Dogecoin is doing its own thing first and foremost. So far, it seems to be doing that job quite well. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

It usually bucks overall market trends, which can work in its favor or huts its appeal altogether. At the same time, the current Dogecoin price is on the rise, and it seems the value of $0.002 will be retaken in the coming hours. There will be some tough DOGE/BTC resistance to contend with, though. When it comes to looking at the current cryptocurrency momentum, it is evident none of the top markets are enjoying a positive spell. That is somewhat to be expected when Bitcoin starts slipping a bit. However, one currency successfully ignoring this overall trend is Dogecoin. Although it is the meme currency of the internet, the value of Dogecoin usually confirms there will be some further positive momentum accordingly. Over the past few hours, the Dogecoin price has increased by nearly 4% in USD value and 4.4% in BTC value. Although one DOGE has not been valued at $0.002 today as of yet, it seems to be a matter of time until that effectively happens. In terms of DOGE/BTC, the 55 Satoshi level has come into play again. Making further progress in either aspect will pose a fair few challenges, but one never knows how these markets evolve. It is evident the current market momentum is getting some Dogecoin holders excited first and foremost. P*ssy Pink is convinced this is a bullish Dogecoin trend which may remain in place for quite some time to come. However, there are also a lot of people who have been holding DOGE for some time now and may be looking to cash out. As such, the coming few hours will be crucial for this altcoin. When looking at the current DOGE price chart, it seems the first key resistance level will be reached near 57 Satoshi. That level will seemingly cause a brief dip before fueling a push to up to 61 Satoshi. A very promising outlook first and foremost, although it is evident the current market momentum might not remain so positive for very long if Bitcoin\u2019s position were to worsen. Not a day goes by without a somewhat interesting Dogecoin meme showing up all of a sudden. Dustin Z has the community covered in this regard. It is a bit unclear what this meme is supposed to represent at this time, though, as a flying lawnmower is not necessarily related to any of the current market momentum. Even so, it is another funny meme the community will most certainly enjoy. When looking at the bigger picture, it is not the first time Dogecoin bucks the overall crypto market trend. That has been one of its strong suits, although one has to wonder how long it will take until Bitcoin drags even this market down with it in quick succession. Until that happens, however, it seems rather unlikely this momentum will turn around in a negative manner. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Why that is happening exactly, will remain a big mystery for a little while longer. The Cardano price is going through a very promising run so far, as its value is looking to approach $0.05 again at some point. In the cryptocurrency world, few projects are effectively making headlines virtually every other day. One of the projects not making much buzz is Cardano, although that doesn\u2019t have to be a negative thing whatsoever. In fact, the relative silence surrounding Cardano means its price can move up quickly with little trading volume. Over the past few hours, all major crypto markets have turned super bullish. The Cardano price has risen by over 4.5% in USD value, bringing the price to $0.04293. In ADA/BTC, there is less of an improvement. A 1.7% gain is not bad by any means, as one ADA is valued at 1,147 BTC. Both trends are made possible through $22.34m in trades, which seems to indicate further upward momentum may materialize at some point in the future. On social media, ADA is getting some attention following these unexpected gains. Crypto Wunderbear, while clearly a Cardano maximalist, has confirmed \u201cit has begun\u201d whether this means the breakout is just beginning or if the reversal is already taking shape, remains to be determined. After all, Cardano has shown a few green candles in a row, which hardly ever goes by without any correction. While the current Cardano momentum can be rather lucrative, it is not the only currency noting strong gains on this Monday morning. In fact, it seems the entire top 15 is in the green, which can mean one of two things. Either this is a legitimate bull trend, or there will be some consolidation before Bitcoin pumps massively and destroys altcoin momentum in the process. For now, both options are still on the table. Some cryptocurrency users are intent on maintaining their regular morning routine regardless of what happens to the likes of Cardano. As Cliff shows, there is nothing better and crypto and coffee in the morning. The image also depicts a Ledger Nano S, which is pretty interesting. Flashing those devices around in the open may not necessarily be the best course of action, though. All signs seem to indicate the cryptocurrency markets are simply reclaiming some of their lost value in rather quick succession. While that was to be expected at some point, sustaining any uptrend has been very problematic in the past twelve months. Only time will tell if this time can be different in a positive manner. Even so, Cardano holders will be quite pleased with this new development, as it has been long overdue. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

While there is indeed a minor uptrend in place, it is far from spectacular. Despite this somewhat disappointing rise in value, some community members are convinced the XRP price is effectively heading to the moon once again. While it is evident XRP hinges on Bitcoin\u2019s price momentum these days, one would expect there to be some differences. At this time, both projects are rising in value in a very similar fashion. Both markets note equally strong gains, but other markets are seemingly moving up a lot quicker. That is a bit unusual where XRP is concerned, although the current momentum is not bad by any stretch of the imagination. Over the past few hours, the XRP price has risen by 2.5%. It is a remarkable figure, although not necessarily the percentages traders and speculators had hoped for. The 0.43% deficit in XRP/BTC is rather interesting as well, although it might not necessarily remain in place for much longer. Ripple\u2019s native asset is also one of the few projects effectively losing ground to Bitcoin right now. There appears to be a genuine reason for excitement where XRP is concerned. Tencent has confirmed it will \u201cembrace the RIpple currency\u201d in the coming months and years. The technology giant is expanding its focus on blockchain technology. They have not confirmed how they will use this technology or asset exactly, but it is still a pretty bullish sentiment regardless. XRP to the M is a Twitter account which is clearly not in favor of jumping to conclusions too quickly. More specifically, it appears as if this \u201cone cent improvement\u201d is being celebrated as a major victory. This user would much rather likely to see some less excitement until this asset hits a value of $1 again. If and when that will happen, remains to be determined at this point. RippleCrippler is trying to ensure the rest of the community remains level-headed first and foremost. Considering how there is a good chance this asset will go through a correction fairly soon, it is important to not get ahead of oneself under these circumstances. However, RippleCrippler also expects this new uptrend to attract some FUD in the process. A bit of a cynical outlook, although developments like these have transpired before. For the time being, it is pertinent to put this XRP uptrend into its proper perspective. There is positive market momentum, yet that doesn\u2019t automatically mean the trend will continue along this path for very long. Additionally, one has to wonder how the XRP/BTC ratio will evolve over the coming hours. With most one-hour candles looking a bit bearish again, any scenario remains viable.

While Ontology is picking up steam on the Binance platform, that alone should not necessarily warrant the current Ontology price increase. However, it seems that is exactly what is happening right now. There is also some excitement regarding Ontology\u2019s version of Gas, known as ONG. Starting off the weekend with a bit of a surprise is not entirely uncommon in the cryptocurrency and token industry. New trading momentum materializes nearly every week even if there is no real reason for it to happen. As such, many people are left wondering why the value of Ontology is suddenly shooting up like a rocket. It would appear the Binance exchange has something to do with that as of late. Over the past few hours, the Ontology price has increased by over 13% in both USD and BTC value. While this latter part is not necessarily all that surprising, it quickly becomes evident noting strong USD gains when Bitcoin isn\u2019t moving up all that much is a different story. It is here where this uptrend gains some legitimacy, primarily because the BTC -based increase allows the USD value to rise, instead of the other way around. On social media, most of the Ontology-related discussions pertain to Binance as well, for some reason. A.M. goes as far as claiming how Binance is the driving factor of this particular price trend. The company is seemingly in the process of adding Ontology\u2019s Gas tot heir trading pairs, which can spark some additional interest in both tokens. Even so, a 13% increase in value based on hype and speculation may not necessarily be sustainable for very long. Sriz is echoing some very similar statements by stating how the CEO of Binance is seemingly \u201cplaying with ONG\u201d at this time. A bit of an odd way of phrasing what may be on the horizon for this utility token, although no one can deny Binance\u2019s trading volume for ONT is picking up steam. It is not the biggest exchange for ONT trading volume at this time, though. The actual price chart for Ontology looks a bit worrisome. A massive green candle has begun forming which will usually lead to a steep retrace. Strong gains are hardly ever maintained in this volatile industry, especially during the weekend. How that will affect the Ontology value over the coming hours and days, remains to be determined. A brief retrace would not necessarily be a bad thing to keep this train going a bit longer. As is always the case in the crypto, asset, and token industry, weekends are not actual trading indicators for the week ahead. Anything that happens on Saturday or Sunday is hardly ever mimicked throughout the week that follows. For Ontology, there appears to be genuine excitement which may spill over to Monday or even Tuesday. However, hype can only sustain uptrends for so long where altcoins, tokens, or assets are concerned. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

The Litecoin price has seen its fair share of increases in the past six weeks. A new strong gain is forming right now, as the value seemingly approaches $45. When the Bitcoin momentum turns anything but bearish, all other markets usually follow in quick succession. This unwritten rule in cryptocurrency has been well-documented in the past few years and is still in effect as of today. Even so, there are some markets which periodically buck this trend. Litecoin isn\u2019t necessarily one of those markets, yet it is benefiting from Bitcoin\u2019s momentum this year. Although Saturdays are not known for their bullish momentum, there has been a notable Litecoin price increase. A 3.8% gain in USD value brings the price to $43.96 again. There is also a 3.2% gain over Bitcoin to bring LTC to 0.012 BTC again. Sustaining that latter threshold may prove difficult, as these \u201cround\u201d levels usually act as tough resistance. Determining the length of this new run will pose its own set of problems. Hov is convinced Litecoin can swing three ways, which is rather normal for any financial market. For the time being, the question remains whether or not LTC has bottomed out or not. It is too early to draw conclusions in that regard, as it wouldn\u2019t take too much bearish pressure on Bitcoin to spoil that plan. Mojo Crypto is looking at things very differently and clearly from a super bullish perspective. He claims a golden cross has formed on the LTC chart which means the altcoin will push through to $50 and even $60 in the coming days. While this may indeed be the case, making such outlandish claims may be a bit premature. Traders and speculators who cannot be bothered to buy Litecoin and hold it for the long term may want to look into arbitrage trading. A few interesting opportunities are available today, with Gobaba and Bitfinex being the main platforms to keep an eye on. Similar to the EOS arbitrage gaps earlier today, Litecoin can yield a profit of 1% or more per trade. For the time being, it would appear the Litecoin community can enjoy another rather promising day. Just because a 3.8% increase has been noted doesn\u2019t mean the price will turn mega bullish all of a sudden. With the ever-increasing trading volume of LTC, however, one can clearly see there is a genuine interest in trading this altcoin right now. As such, anything can happen in the coming days and weeks.

And while this may not be the biggest hack in the recent past, this one was quite unique. The hackers used an online game chatting platform to communicate. As reported by a local media outlet, the crypto exchange detected the intrusion and immediately alerted the police. The police swung into action right away, stopping the attack. However, the hackers had already made away with 13 million Turkish lira ($2.47 million). According to the Istanbul Cybercrime Branch, the hackers infiltrated two of the company\u2019s accounts. They then transferred the cryptos in those accounts to several other accounts. The cryptos they made away with were bitcoin, ether and XRP. The police then began investigating the hack and it didn\u2019t take long for them to locate the suspects. The most unique thing about the hackers: they used a massively popular online game, PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds (PUBG), to communicate with each other. PUBG is similar to Fortnite and is the fifth-highest selling game in the world. The police went on to track the hackers and in their swift operation, they apprehended 24 suspects. The police carried out the operation in eight provinces simultaneously. These are the capital Ankara, Istanbul, Bursa, Antalya, Izmir, Edirne, Bolu and Afyonkarahisar. For their swift action, the police were able to recover 1.3 million lira ($250,000) in crypto. They also recovered 54,000 lira ($10,300) in cash from the suspects. The recovered crypto was reportedly returned to the crypto exchange whose identity the police refused to divulge. The police released two of the 24 suspects after they completed their legal procedures at the police station. The rest of the suspects went on to an Istanbul Courthouse. Here, the court restrained six of them, releasing the remaining sixteen \u2018on condition of judicial control.\u2019 The prices of most cryptos are 80 percent below where they were a year ago. However, this has done little to discourage cybercriminals. Already, hackers have attacked New Zealand crypto exchange Cryptopia and made away with an undisclosed amount of money. Research firm Elementus estimates that the hackers stole $16 million. The firm also revealed that the hackers have already cashed out $3.2 million. Despite the very widely-talked-about hack, Cryptopia has failed to come out and shed some light on what really happened. In an industry that is widely disreputed by the mainstream finance industry, it\u2019s instances like this that further erode the credibility that millions of people have taken years to build.", "date": "2019-02-16T17:16:56+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 16}

JP Morgan announced yesterday that it had successfully trialed the JPM Coin. It will use it for its $6 trillion wholesale payments business as well as securities transactions. In doing so, it became the first bank in the U.S to have its own cryptocurrency. Unsurprisingly, the industry is already racking its brains pondering the implications of the newest crypto. There are those who believe that despite being centralized, the JPM Coin will inspire mainstream adoption of cryptos. It\u2019s only a matter of time before the other banks turn to digital currencies. There\u2019s an even bigger group that believes that JP Morgan has missed the whole point of cryptocurrencies. The JPM Coin will be a centralized currency. Thus, the bank will have a stranglehold on its supply, who uses it and how it\u2019s used. One of the people who believe that the industry should not be celebrating the JPM Coin is Brad Garlinghouse. The eccentric Ripple CEO believes that the bank is taking us back to the old days as we try to move ahead. He tweeted: However, according to one crypto research expert, Garlinghouse has every reason to be critical of the JPM Coin. With the JPM Coin targeting Ripple\u2019s \u2013 and by extension XRP\u2019s \u2013 core market, it\u2019s no surprise that Garlinghouse is so critical. This is according to Tom Shaughnessy, the CEO at New York-based crypto research firm, Delphi Digital. Ripple may have enrolled 100 banks on its platforms, but in JP Morgan, it has a formidable competitor. The bank moves $6 trillion every day on its wholesale payments platforms. Even a fraction of these would be miles ahead of the amount transacted on Ripple\u2019s network. Speaking to Bloomberg, Shaughnessy stated: Shaughnessy isn\u2019t the only one who believes that the JPM Coin is a direct threat to Ripple and XRP. Travis Kling, the founder of Ikigai Asset Management also believes that Ripple Labs should be very worried. The seasoned crypto investor explained: Garlinghouse pointed to an article he wrote on his LinkedIn page in 2016. In the article, he explained that a centralized bank coin would go against Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s vision. Banks are competitive and as such, they\u2019d never settle on one digital currency to use, he reasoned. We\u2019d, therefore, end up with hundreds of bank coins which would add more chaos to the industry. He stated: And while Garlinghouse is quick to criticize the centralization of crypto, XRP has been constantly criticized for the same exact thing. Ripple Labs, which Garlinghouse leads, has been accused of having a whole lot of influence on XRP. Away from the JPM Coin vs. Ripple narrative, there are many who view JP Morgan\u2019s move as very positive. While it\u2019s not everything the crypto world would have wanted, at least a banking giant has recognized that the future belongs to digital currencies. It could also be the first step in the infiltration of the tightly knit finance industry by cryptocurrencies.", "date": "2019-02-16T02:20:57+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 16}

Saturdays and Sundays usually provide very different trading momentum compared to the rest of the week. However, it appears all top markets enjoy some minor positive momentum right now. As far as the EOS price is concerned, the current gains are more than respectable. A 2.1% rise in USD value brings the price to $2.84 again. There is also a 1.8% gain in EOS/BTC, as the altcoin is now valued at 78,318 Satoshi. Both levels should, in theory, be sustainable without too many problems. EOS Also has a very liquid market for a Saturday, with over $716 million in trading volume. There are some key developments taking place which can easily explain this sudden increased interest in EOS. First of all, the EOSfinex trading platform will be ready for testing fairly soon. Although there is some work to be done, an open public beta is expected within the next three weeks. A very positive development for the ecosystem, even though the initial \u201cdeadline\u201d was seemingly missed. Secondly, it would appear there is good news for those developers who want to build dApps on top of the EOS blockchain. Infeos will serve as a JavaScript and npm based framework for such applications. It is a welcome addition for developers, as making the learning curve less steep will usually attract even more attention. Not everyone is interested in buying and holding cryptocurrencies for the long term. That is understandable, as there are plenty of other ways to make good money with cryptocurrencies like EOS. Arbitrage opportunities are available for this coin as well, with an average profit of just over 1.6% per trade. A more than welcome opportunity during the weekend, as the high liquidity should make this a rather profitable option to explore. Two major developments and a heavy increase in weekend-based trading volume seem to indicate this EOS value increase can be justified. It is always a bit difficult to tell as weekends are so \u201cabnormal\u201d compared to weekdays. While this increase in price is noticeable, it seems unlikely much further progress will be made throughout the day. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Such a sight is rather uncommon, especially over the past year or so. As far as the Ethereum price is concerned, the uptrend seemingly remains in place. Minor gains on this day ensure ETH remains the #2 ranked by market cap, for now. There have been some interesting market developments in the cryptocurrency world in the past twelve months. Not only is the extensive bear market still not over by a long shot, it appears the ongoing \u201cflippening\u201d between Ethereum and XRP in terms of market cap will continue for a little while longer. At this time, Ethereum maintains its small lead over XRP, even though both currencies are noting minor gains today. Where the Ethereum price is concerned, not much has changed over the past few hours. Albeit there is a 1% gain in USD value, the 0.5% rise in Bitcoin is less impressive. Because of these minor changes, one Ether is now valued at $123.46, or 0.0339 Bitcoin. This is a very interesting level, as it seems Ethereum is not intent on dropping below that value any time soon. As has been the norm lately, Ethereum has no shortage of overall trading volume, It notes $2.8bn in trades, even on a Saturday. That in itself is remarkable, although the figure will \u2013 most likely \u2013 look a bit different on Sunday afternoon. Even so, the ETH/BTC pairs are the main source of liquidity at this time, although some of the USDT pairs are also making their presence felt. On social media, it seems a lot of people are closely watching the ETH charts right now. CryptHawk considers this to be a bullish sign, as long as the trend line is not broken in a negative manner. In fact, a continuation of this current slow and steady uptrend can result in a \u201clong\u201d signal, although it remains to be seen how these charts look in a few days from today. Perhaps the more interesting development is how Justin Sun seemingly took a jab at Ethereum and Vitalik Buterin. While it is true Vitalik\u2019s comment regarding scalability was a jest in its own right, using it to blatantly promote Tron and BitTorrent Token may not have been the most tasteful idea. Collaboration would be a more favorable approach instead of trying to divide and conquer the crypto world. All signs seem to indicate no immediate Ether price drops should be expected. That in itself is an interesting change of pace from just a few weeks ago. At that time, all cryptocurrencies were facing another set of major losses. While no market is out of the woods yet, this past week and a half have been mildly promising. Cautious optimism seems warranted at this time.", "date": "2019-02-16T19:24:04+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 16}

Not all of the currencies in the top 50 will be able to mount any noteworthy surge right away. As far as the Tron price is concerned, it would appear there is some upward pressure brewing. Although these gains are not massive by any means, it would appear things are heading in the right direction. It is only normal most alternative markets will try to mimic Bitcoin\u2019s momentum when the overall sentiment resumes a minor bullish trend. In the case of Tron, the reliance on Bitcoin has been less apparent as of late, which is a promising first and foremost. Although Tron is also gaining on Bitcoin itself, it would appear the USD value of TRX may continue to improve for quite some time to come. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a notable 3.4% increase in Tron\u2019s USD and BTC value alike. Because of this minor change, the Tron price currently sits at $0.0244, or 674 Satoshi. There is a long way to go before reclaiming the 800 Satoshi level, but the coming days may offer some promising sentiment in this regard. Combined with a rather healthy overall trading volume, it would appear the Tron price is in a very good place as of right now. Although there haven\u2019t been any major developments in terms of Tron, there is a new YouTube video which can effectively educate the masses on why Tron could be a project worth keeping an eye on. As is usually the case, videos trying to get more people to invest in a specific cryptocurrency need to be taken with a grain of salt. However, there appears to be some good information in the video. For those who are wondering what the actual price chart has to offer, it is quite evident the market can easily head north or south from here on out. That in itself can make some speculators a bit uneasy first and foremost, although one has to keep in mind a lot of people seemingly expect a bullish breakout. Even a 1% gain over the weekend can be considered somewhat bullish, though. Paul W Baldwin would like to see the Tron community put in a bit more effort when it comes to helping the price move along. A call to arms usually backfires in the crypto world, which makes this message all the more interesting. It appears some holders are desperate for an uptrend, even though long-term growth needs to be the number one priority at all times. Short-term profits are not in the best interest of most TRX holders. All of these factors seem to indicate the current TRX momentum is firmly in place, although it may not necessarily yield any further gains from here on out. However, with the weekend just around the corner, it would appear some interesting momentum might be shaping up across the industry as a whole. Fridays are never a genuine trading indicator for the coming days, though. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

Over the past few months more and more people believe that it\u2019s no longer profitable to mine Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. However, what if that assumption is wrong? Today we will be going over MiningSky \u2013 a Canadian based cloud mining company which is an official partner of Cryptocompare and ADVFN. MiningSky.io claims to be one of the cheapest and most profitable cloud mining companies in the space. It\u2019s one of the few companies in the world to offer a whole infrastructure of products and services in mining. It claims to be a legitimate company, with mining operations in Canada that is open to the average joe. The MiningSky.io cloud mining platform is now providing an interesting deal, they are offering 2% of the world\u2019s bitcoin hash rate. The platform allows you to mine both Bitcoin and Ethereum at competitive prices. It boasts over 400,000 active users and has active support 18 hours a day.

Even though there is some minor bearish pressure after the excitement calmed down, it seems the 27 Satoshi value will be maintained after all. For most BitTorrent Token price speculators, that will be a promising development. The past 24 hours have resulted in some uneasy momentum for most cryptocurrencies, tokens, and digital assets. This is primarily because Bitcoin\u2019s price has remained a bit stuck in the dirt for multiple days. Now that the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is showing minor signs of bullish momentum, one would expect others to follow suit. BitTorrent Token is a notable exception, for the time being. To put this in perspective, the BitTorrent Token price has dropped by 1.21% over the past few hours. This brings the value to $0.000969 again, or 27 Satoshi. In terms of BTT/TRX, it seems the current ratio remains near the 0.04 TRX level, which is a positive sign. Since none of the current setbacks are too worrisome, it seems likely BTT may return to $0.001 pretty quickly. That is, assuming this coin will follow the Bitcoin price trend in the coming hours. One big development for BTT this week is how the token is now officially supported on Changelly. This trading service has become quite popular among cryptocurrency enthusiasts in recent years, primarily because of the many different supported currencies at this time. Adding BTT to the list is a pretty intriguing turn of events, although it remains to be seen if there will be any significant demand for this token moving forward. Some users are also a bit confused as to why Tron creator Justin Sun is hyping up BTT so much, rather than focusing on his \u201cown\u201d currency first and foremost. While there is argument to be made in this regard, there is also a reason for this \u201chype\u201d. After all, BitTorrent Token is an integral part of the overall Tron ecosystem, thus it is only normal it is given some special attention. Even so, the community could use some more focus on TRX, it seems. When looking at the actual BTT price chart, it quickly becomes apparent this market will easily go either way pretty quickly. Mads Roland is convinced there will be another uptrend in the coming days, primarily because a minor flag is forming on top of a bigger flag. This will primarily play out for BTT/USDT, though, and might not necessarily represent any upcoming changes in BTT\u2019s Bitcoin value. Although the opinions on BTT are still somewhat divided, the token continues to attract a fair bit of attention. Its overall trading volume has declined from $400m to $80m, which is not entirely abnormal once the main excitement cools off a little. Even so, there is still a lot of interest in this particular token, at least for speculative reasons. How that will affect its value over the coming days, remains to be determined.

Although there have been times when this situation seemed to improve, the lengthy bear market will have eroded a lot of goodwill in this regard. New research by Global Blockchain Business Council shows there is still a bright future ahead for trading digital assets in the next two years. Even in 2019, a lot of people seemingly confuse cryptocurrencies and digital assets for being two concepts of the same breed. That is not entirely accurate, even though some digital assets and cryptos can be traded intermittently. Even so, there is a bigger chance digital assets will go mainstream in terms of trading compared to Bitcoin and altcoins. A new report by the Global Blockchain Business Council seems to confirm as much. Their recent survey indicates investors have high hopes for the next few years. One in five respondents expects digital assets to be regularly traded in 2021. That is quite a positive outlook, although one that may prove difficult to achieve. It mainly depends on which types of digital assets one is talking about, and whether or not they are paired to cryptocurrencies in terms of trading pairs. Even if this were not to happen in the next two years, there is a growing belief such a development is inevitable. In total, nearly seven in ten investors expect digital assets to be commonly traded in the next ten years at the latest. Such overwhelming support and belief is rather telling, although it remains up to regulators and market participants to make it happen. There is still a small group of investors who worry institutional investors will never partake in digital asset trading. GBBC CEO Sandra Ro adds: As is always the case with research on this scale, the sample pool of respondents quite limited. More specifically, PollRight interviewed 71 institutional investors from around the world. As such, these statistics only represent the expectations of a minority of people when looking at the bigger picture. That doesn\u2019t mean this vision will not necessarily come true, but one has to keep in mind these investors are not necessarily representative of the rest of the industry. The future of finance may very well hinge on exposure to alternative assets and currencies. Whether or not that means there is a future for digital assets or even cryptocurrencies, is a different matter altogether.

President Trump has issued another plan to effectively build his wall on the border between the US and Mexico. After not receiving the necessary funding to do so, he now plans a \u201cnational emergency\u201d to move this process along. On the surface, it is commendable to see people stick to their ideals and beliefs. If something is the best course of action, there is no reason to back down from that ideal. When it comes to President Trump\u2019s wall on the Mexican border, the opinions regarding this project are scattered. It is also part of the reason why the United States went through a lengthy shutdown in recent months. Although no further progress has been made in this debacle, the President himself has come up with a new plan. Rather than wait for funding to be approved through normal channels, he will declare a national emergency which could commence later today. The goal is to use this national emergency to effectively build the proposed wall. This is in stark contrast to his earlier commitment not to finance this idea after all. This new development comes at a most peculiar time. The shutdown in the US was finally ended last night, yet it is a bit unclear if this national emergency may rekindle these debates next week. Declaring such an emergency to access billions of dollars will create a lot of backlash. The US government is already as divided as it can be right now, and this new plan will only make the situation worse for all parties involved. As part of this new plan, the goal is to use money for fencing along the border combined with other money from \u201cunnamed programs\u201d. It is a very bold and dangerous plan, but one that can give President Trump what he has desired for so long. However, there is still a long way to go before this national emergency is effectively declared, as the political repercussions would be quite severe. If this plan is to be put in motion. President Trump can spend up to $8bn on this wall. This is a lot higher compared to the initial $5.7bn required for this venture, which Congress aptly refused on every possible occasion. Some people see this as the President delivering on his initial promise, whereas others consider it the most ludicrous decision any US president has made to date. How all of this will pan out over the coming weeks, remains to be determined. There is a lot of backlash to deal with even for just proposing this bold idea, let alone executing it. It would certainly put a lot of strain on the US economy, which hasn\u2019t been doing too well in recent years.

Whereas most people have high hopes for Bitcoin, it seems the current momentum doesn\u2019t warrant too much optimism. The EOS price is also going down significantly, but that was somewhat to be expected. In the cryptocurrency world, virtually all markets rely on Bitcoin in one way or another. Most of the time, that allows altcoins to turn bullish when Bitcoin does much of the same. However, if the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency turns bearish, it is only normal all of the other cryptocurrencies will do the same. EOS is a clear example of how dire things can get in quick succession. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a drastic change where the EOS price is concerned. Following a steep 4.5% drop in both USD and BTC value, it would appear all of the positive momentum has been eroded. That in itself will pose a few challenges of its own in terms of value recovery. With a current value of $2.8 and a BTC value of 0.00077 BTC, things could be far worse for this popular token. One of the latest projects built on top of the EOS blockchain goes by the name of Karma. It is a new dApp which aims to build a different breed of social network to incentivize people to do good in the world. Steady Coins shared an interesting image of how this looks in most people\u2019s minds, even though the reality is hopefully very different. There is a very intriguing EOS-related development as far as block producer guidelines are concerned. EOS42 has confirmed the regproducer contract will be rewritten to define more explicit procedures to bring Block producers together. It is a pretty substantial development for the ecosystem as a whole. It will not necessarily impact the price, yet it confirms the project is still under active development at this time. When it comes to dealing with the current value decline, multiple options are available. Some traders will cost average down, whereas others will seek alternative options. Arbitrage trading with EOS can be quite lucrative today, as a fair few different exchanges have a decent spread between them. As such, there is still some good money to be made where this altcoin is concerned. All of the signs point toward a positive future for EOS, even if the current price might not necessarily reflect it all that well. With ongoing developments behind the scenes and new dApps being built on a regular basis, EOS appears to be in a very good place.

When Bitcoin goes in the green \u2013 albeit ever so slightly \u2013 the other currencies will usually follow suit pretty quickly. For the EOS price, these current gains can prove to be crucial. Its \u201cflippening\u201d with Litecoin in terms of market cap will continue for quite some time to come, it seems. The past week and a half have been relatively positive for EOS watchers. The value of this currency has risen significantly, and it appears most of the bearish pressure can be negated without too many problems. There is also the recent push to the market cap top 4 lately, although EOS has dropped to #5 again after Litecoin noted some higher quick gains. It seems likely both currencies go one-up one another for some time to come. Over the past 24 hours, the momentum in cryptocurrency has turned from semi bearish to semi bullish. Such shifts tend to occur quite regularly, although this is a pretty interesting development, all things considered. For the EOS price, it means a 0.8% gain can be noted in both USD and BTC value. One EOS is now valued at $2.82 or 0.000777 Bitcoin. Both levels are seemingly sustainable based on the current trading volume. Behind the scenes of the EOS ecosystem, it would appear a new partnership has been formed between Unlimited Tower and EOS Park. Both entities partner to build better API and full node endpoints for the items and user activities provided by Unlimited Tower. It is a pretty significant development for this alternative currency itself, as EOS continues to grow and evolve at an accelerated pace. Secondly, it would appear a new gaming dApp built on EOS is getting some attention. Known as Ready Player One \u2013 nothing to do with the actual movie or book \u2013 it offers Monopoly-esque gameplay elements. It is a game which has been in development for some time now. Efforts like these can make more people aware of EOS and how its blockchain can function. Not all dApps have to be gambling related or DExes, after all. For traders and speculators who are not too bothered about the current market value of EOS, there are some interesting arbitrage opportunities to take note of as well. Different platforms maintain a variable price for EOS at this time, which can make for some easy profits along the way. Considering how most traders yield a 1% profit or more, there is a good reason to exploit these price gaps for profit. Based on all of these developments and circumstances, it would appear as if this may be the beginning of a new EOS mini bull run. Although it is still too early to say so for sure, these developments can all impact the price in a positive manner. Unfortunately for EOS and other currencies, that will primarily depend on how the Bitcoin price evolves over the coming hours and days. Anything can happen ahead of a weekend, after all.

Whereas Bitcoin is struggling a bit across the board, the Electroneum price seems poised to bounce back strongly. While a minor USD loss can still be noted, it seems there is a small uptrend forming in ETN/BTC. Under the current market circumstances, one would expect all currencies, tokens, and assets that are not Bitcoin to bleed value all over the place. Thankfully, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has matured quite a bit in recent years, meaning not all altcoins will collapse when Bitcoin loses 0.2%. In the case of Electroneum, the current momentum isn\u2019t looking half bad. In fact, it somewhat resembles the current Dogecoin price trend. Over the past few hours, there has been some minor bullish momentum forming where Electroneum is concerned. Although offsetting the USD losses is still difficult, it would appear the Electroneum price is gaining slightly on Bitcoin. A 0.2% increase is not something to get overly excited about just yet, but it is better than most other altcoins on the market today. For now, the 180 Satoshi level acts as support. That should, in turn, keep the price above $0.0066 for a while as well. On social idea, the big news of the week so far is how ETN has been listed on another exchange. Coinexmarket, based in the United Kingdom, has officially confirmed Electroneum deposits are available and trading has gone live yesterday afternoon. That in itself is a big development, as ETN isn\u2019t listed on too many exchanges right now. The overall liquidity of Coinexmarket remains to be determined, as it might not necessarily be a major player in the future. There is also the ongoing vote on DynX which features Electroneum as one of the available options. For now, it seems Reddcoin has taken the lead in terms of getting listed as a base pair on this platform, although that situation is still developing at this time. Electroneum is not that far behind, although the RDD community will not necessarily let this opportunity slip by without a fight. Last but not least, the ETN community is counting down to Mobile World Congress 2019. Considering how the Electroneum team will make its presence known at this event, there has been some speculation as to which announcements the community can expect. So far, nothing has been officially confirmed in regards to potential announcements, but there is some genuine excitement brewing among community members. All things considered, it remains a bit unclear where the ETN price will head over the coming hours. Although it seems remarkably stable at this point, there is no guarantee that situation will remain in place for very long. With its very weak overall trading volume, it seems unlikely any major pushes should be expected. This also means a minimum amount of bearish pressure can send the market in a negative spiral.

Even though Bitcoin and most top markets are still trying to decide upon their future direction, it would appear other projects aren\u2019t keen to wait. In fact, the Tezos price shows there is a lot of positivity brewing behind the scenes. To be more specific, there is positivity where the price is concerned, although it remains a bit unclear how long such a trend can last under these circumstances. Over the past few hours, the value of XTZ has increased by over 8%. That is a clear bullish signal, although there is no real indication this trend will continue for very long. Its overall trading volume looks rather bleak with just $2.5m in trades. Other altcoins usually do well with that kind of volume, but in the case of Tezos, there are seemingly a fair few bag holders. The current price of $0.43 might trigger some cashouts in quick succession. On social media, there are a fair few interesting discussions pertaining to Tezos right now. More specifically, Leandr23rf is convinced things will only improve from here on out. This user expects Tezos to enter the market cap top 10 in the very near future. Doing so would require a sixfold increase in price per XTZ, which may not necessarily be plausible anytime soon. There are also some claims regarding fake Tezos trading volume on UEX. Although such claims are not exactly uncommon, it is always a bit worrisome when they pertain to specific currencies or platforms. While it is seemingly confirmed this exchange has fake XTZ trading volume, although that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it will impact the price in any official capacity right away. When looking at the actual XTZ price chart, it quickly becomes evident this daily chart may not offer much hope in terms of further gains later today. While there is a chance the momentum has not peaked yet, one has to keep in mind there will undoubtedly be some form correction kicking in. For the time being, users can enjoy this spell of positive momentum while it lasts. Bitcoin still has to break out again before any altcoin can officially solidify its gains. With Bitcoin still on rather shaky legs, it will become pretty difficult for any other alternative currency to maintain gains at this time. While Tezos is usually not linked to Bitcoin in a significant manner, there will always be some form of correlation users need to take into account at all times. Bitcoin dictates the pace of all other projects and markets, and Terzos will not be an exception in that regard whatsoever. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/exclusive-interview-with-dr-larry-sanger-wikipedia-co-founder-and-everipedia-cio/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Exclusive \u2013 Interview With Dr. Larry Sanger, Wikipedia Co-Founder and Everipedia CIO", "content": "Everipedia is a blockchain based project that features an online encyclopedia similar to the all famous Wikipedia. I had the opportunity to speak exclusively with Dr. Larry Sanger, Wikipedia Co-Founder and Everipedia CIO and ask Sam Kazemian, Everipedia Co-Founder questions about the project. Below is a summary of our Q&A session which explains the ins and outs of the project along with the various aspects of their IQ token. What was your main reason for leaving Wikipedia and starting Everipedia? Sanger stopped working for Wikipedia back in 2002, way before the introduction of blockchain or the creation of Everipedia. Sanger always thought there\u2019s gotta be a way to improve on Wikipedia. There could be so many more people and experts involved, the articles could be higher quality, and there could be less trolls dominating the proceedings. According to Sanger, all of those problems that he saw early on have not gone away. Sanger saw potential in Everipedia with their modern design and new model and having extensive experience working with Wikipedia it only made sense to join Everipedia as a CIO. What are some differences between Wikipedia and Everipedia? Everipedia has a lot more people working on the project. According to Dr. Sanger, when he was part of Wikipedia there \u201cwere basically two and a half at most people working on it.\u201d With Everipedia there are three really good developers, 10 people on the editorial staff writing articles, and other people on the executive team. Everipedia more closely resembles a traditional startup, with funding close to $30 million from outside investors. According to Sanger, the investors come from the people behind Block.one, EOS, and Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital. On the platform side, Everipedia allows anybody can make pages on anything. There editing is more modern and there is appreciation for mems and youtube videos. There are also verified accounts for celebrities and noteworthy individuals. How can people get their account verified? Right now if you want to be verified, you message someone from the editorial staff to manually verify you. What made you decide to choose to build Everipedia on EOS rather than ETH or another platform? The development of EOS is led by Daniel Larimer who was the Co-Founder of Steemit \u2013 which is the first major content blockchain. EOS is developed specifically for utility tokens and is tailored to content. The long term plan includes the ability to put a virtual computer on a blockchain and Everipedia would like to be part of that computer. EOS also has a staking mechanism built in which makes sense for Everipedia. When someone proposes a new edit to Everipedia, they have to stake a small amount of tokens. They lose those tokens if the edit isn\u2019t approved by the community but that provides a small amount of assurance that the information isn\u2019t going to be completely frivolous. How does Voting work with Everipedia? Does it cost IQ? How much does it cost? It doesn\u2019t exactly cost IQ. For now, you convert some IQ into Brain Power (BP), and when you take any official action that interacts with the blockchain you have to burn a little bit of BP but you get it back. Relationship between IQ and BP? There is a 1:1 ratio between the two and you get BP from staking IQ. Why don\u2019t you get IQ from staking IQ? Initially, Everipedia didn\u2019t want people to worry that they are losing their tokens when they are staking them so it was converted into something that wasn\u2019t immediately impacting the blockchain. But, the team decided that this is a complexity that isn\u2019t needed and BP will be depreciated. According to Sam Kzemian \u2013 Co Founder of Everipedia: \u201cYou get IQ for writing good articles and curating articles. To partake in those activities, you need to stake IQ. Staking IQ is technically the \u201ccost\u201d or the \u201cfee\u201d for using app on the blockchain. You don\u2019t get rewarded for just using the app. You have to use it well/create good content.\u201d Besides voting and editing are there any other roles for IQ? You can use IQ to vote on new smart contracts that define the governance of the network. IQ is a measure of one\u2019s ability to determine policies for the whole network. Let\u2019s talk more about IQ. Is it mineable? It\u2019s not mineable but the way it is unlocked or created is when a person gets an article approved they get a certain amount of IQ based on a complex equation. Sam clarified on the topic, saying that it\u2019s mineable in the sense that you get rewarded IQ for doing good work. However, it\u2019s not a proof of work coin so it\u2019s not mineable in the same way Bitcoin is. Why are there 4.5 billion circulating supply vs 10 billion total supply. Does the Everipedia team hold a certain amount of IQ? According to Sam: \u201cThis has nothing to do with us. This is Coinmarketcap\u2019s definition of circulating supply. CMC does not count coins that have not yet verifiably hit exchanges or left \u201cfounders/company\u201d wallets. We actually disagree with their metrics and in our internal valuation metrics have 10B as the circulating supply. We think 4.5B is a very misleading metric CMC is perpetuating. It\u2019s not up to us.\u201d How can you earn IQ? How is IQ rewarded based on editing? Is it a set amount per edit? Sam: \u201cIt\u2019s not a per edit scale. Users who have IQ staked can curate other people\u2019s content/edits and vote how good they think the work is. The more votes you get from fellow IQ stakers the more of the token rewards you are entitled to. For example, if you just add a period and grammar fixes to an article, you might only get a very small amount of votes and proportionally get a small amount of IQ as a reward compared to someone who just authored a well-sourced biography of a famous American rapper.\u201d Looking at the tutorial it says you need 3 things: EOS account, IQ tokens, Scatter account. Could you explain the role of each of these things. I was able to create an account, login via twitter, and start creating a page, what am I missing? Sam: \u201cScatter is a wallet for holding IQ/EOS. It is not needed anymore as there are other ways to hold IQ/stake such as OREID (which lets you use your social media account as a bridge to EOS). But from the protocol level, yes, you need IQ and an EOS account to use the Everipedia app. We\u2019ve just done a good job of slowly taking care of those needs for non-tech savvy users so that it all melts into the background and they can get to using the site and editing like normal.\u201d Looking on CMC Everipedia did not have a marketcap until October 2nd, what is the reason behind it? That was a problem on CMC\u2019s end. It took them awhile to get all the EOS dApps listed. The lack of a marketcap has nothing to do with Everipedia, nothing changed in October. Sam clarified: \u201cAgain, this is all CMC. They decide when there is \u201cenough liquidity and market data\u201d to enter a market cap on their website for each token. We do not control anything on CMC\u2019s site. It is all their policies.\u201d Everipedia has quite a bit of activity. How many users / editors does it have? Is there a way to track that? While the exact amount of users for the platform is not available, according to Everipedia\u2019s Co-founder and Chief Community Officer, Mahbod Moghadam, the number of Everipedia editors is in the thousands. Since recently, Everipedia switched to a completely crypto-centric model only allowing users with EOS wallets to register and edit articles, the number of editors is currently in the hundreds. However, by the end of the month, the site will return to its norm of thousands of editors and allow new users to register using their Facebook/Twitter login information. What new features are coming to Everipedia? There are a few things. The most important thing is a new front end. Editing articles will be as if you are editing a google doc. Creating accounts will be as easy as it is on any major social media. Beyond that, being able to contribute to the network from a lot of different sources of articles. Ultimately, Everipedia wants to have metadata about all the encyclopedias in the world on the blockchain. A system where you can track ratings of those articles on the blockchain. Also, a prediction market is being built on top of the IQ network. There is nothing about the whitepaper of the backend technology of Everipedia that requires that content be an encyclopedia. As a result, one of the directions the company is taking is to support \u201cknowledge\u201d dApps that are interested in different kinds of information. Last but not least, another project that is in the pipelines is a replacement for Quora.", "date": "2019-02-14T08:29:27+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 14}

Although last week was pretty good for Litecoin in many different ways, it appears that momentum has come to an end. The Litecoin price is struggling to remain above $40 right now, yet it seems the 0.01 BTC level should be maintained for the foreseeable future. One has to acknowledge last week saw some pretty crazy Litecoin action. Over the course of the week, the altcoin rose to the #4 market cap spot following a strong 40% gain. Sustaining such momentum seemed to be doable, although Bitcoin\u2019s momentum decided to spoil that party rather abruptly. When Bitcoin loses value in quick succession, all other currencies will follow suit. Litecoin is no exception in this regard. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a notable decrease in the Litecoin price. With a 5% drop in USD value, one LTC is now priced at $41.56. There is also an ongoing decline in LTC/BTC, with Litecoin losing 4.3% recently. Both of these trends are quite worrisome in their own regard, although it remains to be seen if things will get even worse or suddenly improve. On the social media front, Litecoin is not doing all that bad either. Alan Austin sees the recent Wells Fargo as an opportunity for Bitcoin and Litecoin to gain more traction. In the past, incidents affecting major financial players have not necessarily made a meaningful impact on the cryptocurrency industry whatsoever. It seems unlikely this latest trend will be any different in that regard. The Litecoin Foundation also sent an interesting Tweet to the world not that long ago. While the message itself is not necessarily all that great, it is evident there are still plenty of people who do not own any form of cryptocurrency at this time. That also means there is a very big market waiting to be tapped by Litecoin and others. Convincing the masses of this new form of money has proven to be challenging so far. NYK S is convinced the coming days and weeks may prove crucial for Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies alike. More specifically, he expects big movements from Litecoin, Ethereum, and the likes. That will only happen when Bitcoin maintains itself at the current level or better, though, which might not necessarily be as straightforward as people would expect. Based on all of the market circumstances, it would appear the value of Litecoin should not drop too much in the coming hours. While it is certainly possible that situation will turn around in the near future, the current losses appear pretty severe already. As long as LTC/BTC maintains the 0.01 level, there should not be too much to be concerned about at this time. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

As far as the XRP is concerned, this minor downtrend may revitalize the market. In fact, it seems the small losses in USD value are driving a small push in XRP/BTC. An interesting situation well worth keeping an eye on. It is evident a minor decrease in Bitcoin\u2019s value can send all other markets in a rather negative spiral as well. As has been the case over the past eleven months, that pattern is now repeating itself once again. That in itself is not the biggest surprise, but it is certainly something a lot of people will not approve of. Even so, It is the card traders are dealt, and they will have to make the best of it. Over the past 24 hours, there is a minor decrease in XRP\u2019s USD value. This decrease brings the XRP price back to $0.303. Not something to be overly concerned about at this time, especially when looking at the minor gain in XRP/BTC. This particular ratio has risen by 0.48% and seems on its way to surpassing 8.400 Satoshi again in the coming hours. As is always the case where XRP is concerned, the asset remains the talk of the town on Twitter. Cryptobu77 has shifted his portfolio from Holo to XRP and BTT. It seems to make sense for people who do not want to keep funds on exchanges. It is always better to control one\u2019s own private keys, as trading platforms can disappear overnight without prior warning. There is also seemingly a new line of XRP merchandise making the rounds. As SmoothDealer shows off there are some new XRP caps users can enjoy. While this may not impact the price at all, it is an effort to raise more awareness for this digital asset. In that regard alone, the cap will certainly pique some people\u2019s interest. Last but not least, it would appear the current XRP momentum is also posing interesting challenges for XRP Classic. While not affiliated with the main project in the slightest, it seems the value is rising. Always conduct one\u2019s own research prior to investing in this offshoot, as it is a somewhat controversial project which annoys a lot of XRP community members. All things considered, it is safe to say XR remains at a status quo for the time being. The losses in USD value are nearly offset by gains in XRP/BTC, thus not much has changed in the past few hours. Whether or not XRP can reclaim the 8,400 Satoshi level and turn it into solid support, is a different matter altogether. The coming hours may prove very crucial in this regard.

Despite this form of money being very popular, it also irates the local government. A new proposal has appeared in local newspapers which claims crypto transactions will be taxed. It remains unclear how the government plans to enforce such actions in the real world, though. It is not the first time Bitcoin and altcoins are met with a lot of scrutiny in Venezuela. Ever since the country introduced its own native cryptocurrency, any efforts involving Bitcoin and altcoins have been scrutinized beyond belief. President Maduro is, seemingly, intent on ensuring the Petro will be the only cryptocurrency still standing in his country when push comes to shove. In the latest effort, it would appear Venezuela\u2019s government will try to tax regular cryptocurrency transactions. While there is an argument to be made for this particular approach, it will always be difficult to effectively do so in the real world. After all, this new form of regulation will apply to both individual users and legal entities alike. A valiant effort, but one that will also pose its own set of problems. According to local sources, this new regulation will introduce some key changes. First of all, there will be monthly limits as to how much cryptocurrency users can transact every single month. Again, ensuring consumers and companies adhere to these limits is very difficult, depending on which cryptocurrency is being used in the process. Using privacy-oriented coins like Monero can easily bypass these restrictions. Secondly, anyone looking to surpass the monthly limits put in place needs to obtain specific approval from SUNACRIP. For those unaware, this is the Venezuelan National Superintendency of Crypto Assets and Related Activities. Obtaining approval will be very difficult first and foremost, and there will still be a hard limit in place even when getting approval. Not necessarily the approach either consumers or corporations are looking for. For the time being, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding how these new rules will be enforced. While tracking crypto transactions is not all that complicated, some currencies can easily put a spoke in the wheel. Moreover, it remains a bit unclear if this only applies to Petro transactions or all cryptocurrencies being used in Venezuela. If it is the former, other cryptocurrencies may become \u201cprohibited\u2019 in Venezuela at this rate. This is yet another strategic development in Venezuela, albeit one that seemingly will benefit neither consumers nor corporations. While it is understandable the Petro is considered to be the lifeblood of the Venezuelan economy right now, it too remains shrouded in mystery and controversy. All things considered, it would appear this new guideline will not cause too many problems until its exact purpose and implication are explained in an official capacity.", "date": "2019-02-13T09:01:55+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 13}

This mainly stems forth from Bitcoin slipping just a tiny bit. Most listings keep their value in check without too many problems. In the case of the Revain price, there is an actual increase in value as well. A remarkable development under these conditions. In the cryptocurrency world, there is always some unpredictability affecting at least one particular market. While that might not be happening within the top 15 today, there are some interesting shifts further down the rankings. Revain, for example, has begun moving up again as most other markets struggle a bit. It is a good time to make oneself known to the bigger audience, although this trend could reverse course at any given time. In the past few hours, the Revain price has risen by 5.6% to bring its USD value to $0.153. There is also a clear 65% increase in BTC and ETH value, which will get even more people excited. All of these gains are sustainable, by the look of things, as none of them stand out as outrageous. The timing of this increase is a bit unusual, though, but that should not pose too much of a problem either. In terms of actual market activity, there is not much to report on. While just $1.82m worth of trading volume is far from impressive, it is potentially sufficient to ensure this uptrend remains in place. Revain never has much trading volume. BTC-Alpha and DragonEX remain its top trading platforms, neither of which is wildly popular among crypto traders these days. Speaking of exchanges, it would appear KuCoin has completed the maintenance for Revain and its wallet. As such, users are once again able to deposit R into their account balance and commence trading. Revain has been available on KuCoin for quite some time now, yet it never generates too much trading volume to speak of. The bigger news for Revain is how the native review platform has gotten the attention of another cryptocurrency project. Bytecoin is now a Revain partner, which can lead to some very intriguing and peculiar use cases over the coming months. Although Bytecoin\u2019s reputation has taken a bit of a hit, dealing with a reliable and transparent review platform may help address that problem. All things considered, the Revain situation is on par with what it always has been. There is some price excitement with little trading volume and no major breakthrough developments. As such, it seems plausible to assume this value will not rise much further, although one never knows where altcoins are concerned. Those currencies tend to have a life of their own.

That situation is slowly changing, as most of the top markets are green across the board once again. The EOS price is rising very strongly, and the currency reclaimed the #4 spot in the market cap rankings by surpassing Litecoin. A very impressive development, given all of the recent market turmoil. In the cryptocurrency world, there is hardly ever a boring day. Something will happen at one point or another, primarily because these markets seem to operate independently from one another more often than not. EOS Has been an interesting example in this regard, as it is currently going through a bit of an unexpected bull run. Even though Bitcoin is rising, that doesn\u2019t always mean altcoins will follow suit. Over the past few hours, the EOS price has risen by nearly 7% in both USD and BTC value. These are impressive developments, especially when considering how EOS quickly overtook Litecoin again in market cap. It would appear EOS is poised to hit $3 later today, although those round figures usually act as strong resistance. It doesn\u2019t happen all that often the crypto industry offers a feel-good story. It would appear that has happened where EOS is concerned. One user accidentally received 103,000 EOS, worth roughly $300,000. He effectively sent it back to the rightful owner, which is pretty impressive, all things considered. Not everyone would do the same if they received an erroneous payment of this magnitude. Secondly, it would appear there is still plenty of EOS-related development taking place behind the scenes. B1 is in the process of developing their first product to run on EOS, although not much is known about it at this time. The EOS repository also has one of the most active developer communities to date. From that point of view, things are looking good on the surface. When looking at the EOS chart itself, it quickly becomes apparent a crucial line will need to be crossed. Given the vast trading volume the altcoin generates, it seems breaking the resistance level should not pose too much of a problem. However, the quick gains can also lead to a brief drop shortly after. The coming hours will be crucial in this regard. For the neutral spectator, this EOS value increase may not necessarily make too much sense. However, it was a matter of time until Litecoin lost the #4 market cap spot, simply because the projects it overtook never lost much value over the weekend to begin with. Even so, there will be some interesting competition going on between the two, and one which speculators will thoroughly enjoy. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Whereas the top markets start to feel some bearish pressure, whereas the Dogecoin price is still going rather strong. Although its gains are minimal right now, the uptrend appears to be in place regardless. Reclaiming the $0.002 level suddenly becomes a reality once again. When all of the top markets start to note minor losses on the hourly chart, one knows the bullish momentum may be coming to an end, for the time being. All five of the top markets are dealing with some minor bearish pressure all of a sudden. Further down the rankings, however, things are getting a lot more interesting. Most currencies are noting small gains to buck the overall bearish trend. As far as the Dogecoin price is concerned, the current situation looks mildly promising. There is a small uptick in both USD and BTC value, with the value slowly making its way back to the $0.002 level. That in itself would be a colossal victory for this altcoin, primarily because it has suffered a fair bit of bearish pressure as of late. In terms of Bitcoin value, one DOGE is still worth 52 Satoshi, with no real improvements in sight. On social media, there is some buzz where Dogecoin is concerned, It appears the meme currency of the internet can now be used to pay for goods at Almighty Boost. Although buying all natural male testosterone boosters may not necessarily be the major use case people are looking for, any new merchant accepting DOGE will be more than welcome. Another feather in the cap of the altcoin. Crypto Strange is looking at DOGE from a completely different perspective. This user is smitten by Dogecoin and considers it to be his favorite even after all this time. That in itself shows Dogecoin certainly has something to offer which most other altcoins do not at this time. Moreover, it also confirms the Dogecoin brand is still going strong after many years. Every Dogecoin-related write-up needs a meme or funny GIF. Today is no different in this regard. Mike Hartnett shared an interesting GIF pertaining to Dogecoin. It also features a dog wearing a tie and glasses. Simple things in life are often the best, and this GIF will bring a smile to many faces. It is also a somewhat correct representation of Dogecoin\u2019s price evolution. All things considered, it appears to be a matter of time until DOGE hits the $0.002 mark once again. Whether or not that will get many people excited, is a different matter altogether. This currency has become very stable in recent months, which also means it sees no real uptrends to take note of. Even so, some stability is still valuable under the current market circumstances, primarily because the volatility is far from over at this point.

That in itself is quite telling, as most of these markets have nothing to do with one another. As far as the XRP price is concerned, the most recent minor gains are piling up nicely. Sustaining a value of over $0.3 should not pose too big of a problem. In the cryptocurrency world, XRP will always remain somewhat of an \u201coddball\u201d. It is not a cryptocurrency by default, a sit serves as a digital asset. Nor is it trying to disrupt the approach Bitcoin and other similar currencies have taken. XRP is a very different breed altogether, even though it can be exchanged freely against most of the common cryptocurrencies on the market today. Even so, it is still ranked #3 in crypto market cap rankings, but that may shift to #2 fairly soon. Over the past 24 hours, the XRP price has noted another small gain in both USD and BTC value. Following a 1.5% increase across the board, it would appear this digital asset is in a pretty good place. With a value of $0.306, it appears sustaining a value above $0.3 will not be much of a problem. In Bitcoin terms, XRP seems to struggle to reach 8,500 Satoshi again, let alone push through to 9,000. On social media, it quickly becomes apparent the XRP chart doesn\u2019t necessarily look all that unique. It is nearly identical to both Bitcoin and Ethereum as of late, which is rather peculiar. Especially when considering how XRP is not a cryptocurrency whatsoever, albeit it can be traded against both Bitcoin and Ethereum on a fair few platforms. All markets keep each other in check, which is very interesting to keep an eye on. As has been the case for some time now, there is still some minor conspiracy theory involving XRP\u2019s price being \u201cmanipulated\u201d. As Nino Alves explains, it seems the XRP value is not allowed to note any real or sustainable gains for quite some time now. While claiming users are buying OTC simply to dump XRP on exchanges may be a stretch, it is evident a lot of users are not too happy with the way this market is evolving. Ecossexrp1 still hopes to wake up soon and notice he or she has gotten rich overnight. For the time being, it seems that is rather unlikely, as there has not been an extensive bull market to speak of in recent months. Things can always turn around at any given moment, but for the time being, no one will be able to \u201csack work\u201d by living the XRP holder life. When looking at the bigger picture, it seems most of the top markets are still in a good place right now. As far as XPR is concerned, the current momentum looks promising, albeit not necessarily in a spectacular manner. After all, small gains also add up over time, even though they might not look like much independently. As long as the value remains above or near the $0.3 level, there is a genuine change a new uptrend will materialize over time. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

This rush comes as a big surprise, especially when considering how bearish the past eleven months have been. Most key markets have noted impressive gains over the week, with Litecoin and Binance Coin clearly leading the pack. When it comes to gauging the overall market sentiment, most people would look at Bitcoin first and foremost. Despite noting a strong 5.8% gain in the past seven days, Bitcoin\u2019s gains appear more than most at the time. A 5% increase is nothing to sneeze at where the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency is concerned. Its current price sits well above $3,600 yet a push to $4,000 hasn\u2019t materialized at this time. Even so, there is a lot of positivity across the industry as of right now. The biggest gainers of the past week \u2013 at least where top currencies are concerned are Litecoin and Binance Coin. It is not surprising to see Binance Coin on this list. Binance remains the world\u2019s biggest exchange to date, and its native currency effectively serves a purpose. In fact, it serves purposes outside of Binance as well, further strengthening its position as a currency. In the past week, BNB gained a total of 36.75%, which is pretty impressive. Litecoin, on the other hand, took a lot of people by surprise. While often overlooked in the crypto industry, LTC has reclaimed significant value in the past week. Following a 31.48% gain, it seems LTC is back where it belongs. Holding on to the fourth place in market cap rankings may be a difficult challenge. For now, however, it seems the trend may continue for some time to come. Other strong gainers this week can be found all over the top 15 by market cap. Cardano noted a solid 10.75% gain, whereas Monero rose by nearly 13%. Dash also did its part with an 18.8% increase, and EOS has risen by 16.25%. All of these gains are more than solid, albeit it is evident they also benefit from Bitcoin\u2019s uptrend first and foremost. For now, all of these individual markets seem to hold their own quite well. A very peculiar shift has happened within the market cap top three. Ethereum has noted very solid gains after an incredibly rough period. With 13.47% in gains over seven days, it is evident the excitement is still in place today. This also allowed the Ethereum price to retake the $120 level, which will please a few investors. Ethereum has also reclaimed the second spot in the market cap rankings. One rather intriguing development across all top markets comes in the form of XRP. Ripple\u2019s native asset has gained 1.44% in value, which is not necessarily all that bad. However, it is evident XRP is underperforming when compared to all other markets right now. That in itself is a bit worrisome, although it will not necessarily deter investors. It will be interesting to see if XRP can take back the #2 spot from Ethereum over the coming week. Right now, that seems very unlikely, even though both markets are separated by just $205m.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/tron-price-drops-slightly-following-bittorrent-token-airdrop/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Tron Price Drops Slightly Following BitTorrent Token Airdrop", "content": "It is still a very intriguing period for all cryptocurrencies, even though it would appear the bullish Bitcoin momentum has subsided a bit. That is only to be expected, but it would appear most of the losses are kept to a bare minimum. The only notable exception within the market cap top 10 is the Tron price, which seems to be losing value pretty quickly. For people who have kept an eye on cryptocurrency lately, they will be aware of how Tron has maintained its value relatively easily. However, now that all TRX holders should have received their \u201cfree\u201d BTT tokens, it is only normal they are liquidating their TRX again. Most of them can still do so with a minor profit, so they will be quite happy with the way things are going right now. As a result, it is not abnormal to see the Tron price decline by nearly 5% in the past few hours. Its USD value has dropped to $0.0245, whereas the TRX/BTC ratio withdrew to the 674 Satoshi level. Neither of these setbacks is worrisome in the slightest, although it is evident there is some liquidation going on behind the scenes. Tron\u2019s overall trading volume hasn\u2019t necessarily changed all that much, as a lot of people are waiting to buy in at a lower price, by the look of things. The big Tron-related news this week is the launch of BitTorrent Token. All TRX holders should have their wallets or exchange balances credited with the correct amount of tokens. Coindelta confirms they have issued all tokens to holders, which is rather interesting. It is a bit odd to see platforms take such swift action, as that is not always the logical outcome. It would also appear one of the Tron testnets is down at this time. More specifically, it seems this is causing some big problems for companies and projects running dApps on top of the Tron blockchain. While this issue should be rectified pretty quickly, it remains to be seen how things will evolve in this particular regard. Addressing issues like these needs to happen swiftly and concisely. Anthony R has noted a pretty interesting correlation over the past few hours. As BTT is one of the biggest gainers on the market, Tron has become one of the bigger \u201cvalue losers\u201d on Binance. It is possible there is a very strong correlation between both events, although one has to keep in mind this is not entirely unexpected behavior either. All things considered, it would appear this is a brief setback where Tron is concerned. Not entirely surprising, as most people obtained TRX just for the \u201cfree\u2019 BTT token airdrop. Considering how the overall trading volume has not increased in any significant manner, it seems unlikely the price will drop much further over the coming hours. At the same time, there is some bearish pressure on Bitcoin, which will undoubtedly leave its mark on other cryptocurrencies. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

As most cryptocurrencies are currently trading sideways Ethereum has joined the party as usual and is following the overall trend. The volume is picking up a bit which is definitely a good sign when it comes to the short term future of Ethereum\u2019s price. Ethereum and XRP are still battling it out for the top second spot with ETH\u2019s market cap currently in the lead by around $200m. As always, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that XRP\u2019s market cap that\u2019s displayed on CoinMarketCap is not the asset\u2019s true cap, depending on who you ask. Despite that fact, Ethereum fans are surely happy with the current situation. After the recent pump during the weekend it\u2019s surprising that Ethereum has held it\u2019s value. After all, cryptocurrencies like XRP, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, TRON, Stellar, and much more have lost some value as the market looked for new support. Whether the current situation with ETH will continue is up for debate. An interesting statistic to take a look at is the reduction of new ether supply per day. Matthew Voke from twitter comments on that fact: With a decreased ETH supply per day there will be an increase in positive market momentum. If that trend continues we can assume more positive momentum moving forward. On the other hand, what stopped the most recent pump most likely were sell orders on Coinbase. In order for ETH to continue the rise there will need to be a lot more buy volume in the near future. As such it\u2019s a good idea to pay close attention to that. Bit in a box from twitter comments on that situation: Overall ETH is in a good position as of right now not just because it held the $120 support level after the weekend, but also due to the fact it surpassed XRP on coinmarketcap and is back at the number two spot. There is also almost 10x more volume for ETH than there is for XRP so things are looking promising for the cryptocurrency in the near future.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/binance-coin-price-doubled-in-price-in-the-past-month/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Binance Coin Price Doubled in Price in the Past Month!", "content": "As slow as the cryptocurrency market has been in 2019, that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t profit to be made. Quite a few cryptocurrencies gained substantial value since the beginning of the year, including TRON that went from $0.018 to $0.024, Litecoin that went from $30 to $43, HOLO that doubled in price from $0.0005 to $0.001, and of course Binance Coin that also almost doubled in price from $5.50 to $9.64 at the time of writing. The first reason that comes to mind is Binance\u2019s Launchpad. After having an extremely hyped BitTorrent token sale on their platform that sold out in roughly 14 seconds, Binance is responsible for most of the hype in the cryptocurrency world. Not only does it dominate the trading volume with over $600 million traded in the past 24 hours, it also has an extremely good reputation. Changpeng Zhao is extremely loved in the crypto community partly due to his outstanding communication when it comes to any exchange problems. With the recent positive momentum $BNB reached the top 10 coins based on market cap. It\u2019s roughly $200m ahead of Bitcoin SV which lost over 30% in value since the beginning of the year. One interesting pattern to notice is the correlation between the increase in volume and increase in price for $BNB. As Walter Wyckoff highlights this phenomenon on twitter: We can only assume that if the volume keeps rising then the price will also. Looking at the next event which should spark an increase in volume for BNB is the launch of Fetch.AI on the Binance Launchpad. The launch is scheduled for Feb 25th which is 2 weeks away. According to the project specification, Fetch.AI aims to bring together machine learning, AI and blockchain to create an economic internet. It\u2019s a complicated project that\u2019s hard to explain in a single sentence. If you are interested in looking into it, you can read the whitepaper. Binance\u2019s token launch platform is definitely a key player in the success of $BNB\u2019s price, as each token that is launched on the platform accepts $BNB by default. This crease demand for Binance Coin which in turn increases the price. It almost looks like the Binance Launchpad is serving as a replacement for ICOs for 2019. While STOs are replacing traditional Initial Coin Offerings, Binance launchpad allows for a much more widely accessible platform to raise funding for a project. Furthermore, the projects are vetted by the Binance team which dramatically reduces the chances of scams. At the time of writing $BNB is trading at $9.60, up almost 3% in the past 24 hours. Current trading volume is at $141m coming mostly from Binance as expected. Disclaimer: The author may have a stake in the cryptocurrencies discussed in the article.

After several days of positive momentum, it is evident a correction needs to kick in sooner or later. For the time being, most setbacks are kept to a minimum. The Electroneum price, however, is giving up ground at an accelerating pace all of a sudden. Despite some very interesting developments behind the scenes, it would appear Electroneum isn\u2019t necessarily capable of sustaining its value right now. This is primarily because Bitcoin has turned rather bearish again, which usually triggers an industry-wide panic where altcoins, tokens, and digital assets are concerned. Electroneum has seemingly gotten caught up in the craze right now, which would explain the most recent losses. Over the past 24 hours, it would appear the Electroneum price has dropped by 4% in USD value and gave up 3% in BTC value. As such, one ETN is valued at $0.0069, which means control over the $0.007 level has been lost. If the 190 Satoshi threshold holds, however, there is no reason to be overly concerned as of yet. This appears to be a temporary setback based on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum first and foremost. The big news of the day is how Electroneum\u2019s Android application now supports cloud mining as well. Although iOS users have been able to access this functionality for some time now, it would appear Android users will be able to get in on the action as well. A pretty big development, assuming users are willing to complete the mandatory KYC verification. So far, the initial feedback regarding the Android release has been pretty positive. It works exactly the same as its iOS counterpart, with users expecting to receive a payout when their balance surpasses 100 ETN. As Android users can now access this functionality too, the ecosystem will undoubtedly continue to grow at a pretty steady pace. For those looking to give the gift of Electroneum checking out the ETN Gift Cards platform might be worth a try. Although one should always do their own research prior to dealing with these platforms, it is evident more efforts are launched to bring ETN to the masses. While it might not necessarily be the most successful venture at this time, any effort should be applauded. All things considered, the Electroneum developments and its current market value do not necessarily correlate. The launch of Android-based cloud mining is a pretty big deal. However, the bearish pressure affecting Bitcoin and other top markets will cause some problems for smaller cap altcoins like ETN. Even so, it seems likely the losses will not get out of hand too much, and this should only pose a minor setback. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Following some strong gains the BitTorrent Token price has now reached a value of $0.001102. A very impressive feat of strength, although not everyone sees merit in this token. Under most circumstances, a token which is airdropped to thousands of people will usually be dumped at any price on the open market. With BTT, those expectations were somewhat the same, primarily because it was issued to TRX holders across all exchanges. Interestingly enough, it would appear the demand for BTT is picking up, rather than seeing the price collapse entirely. That can still happen in the days to come, though. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a notable BitTorrent Token price increase. A 27% gain in USD and BTC value is nothing to sneeze at. For now, the currency has yet to surpass the 30 Satoshi level in a convincing manner, but the buy support on Binance is stacking up quickly. There is also a 30% gain in TRX value, which will be of even greater interest to most users. On social media, the opinions regarding BTT are somewhat divided. That is only normal, as the hype surrounding this token is seemingly off the charts. CryptoNate wouldn\u2019t mind seeing all of the shilling calm down a bit. It may take a while until that happens, especially if this uptrend were to be resumed for several days in a row. Anything remains possible, but shilling hasn\u2019t done any currency any good. What is rather interesting is how so many people are excited about BTT reaching a new all-time high in the past 36 hours While it seems a bit odd to talk about such terms for a token which has only been around for 12 hours, it is evident there is some merit to this statement as well. A new all-time high will seemingly not happen anytime soon, though, as the bearish pressure is mounting. When looking at the actual BitTorrent Token chart, it is evident there has been a strong push a few days ago, which will not necessarily be mirrored later today. A push to 37 Satoshi would be quite a development for this young token, although Bitcoin\u2019s value has risen significantly as well. Given the hefty supply of BTT, no one should expect any miracles right away. All things considered, this price action will keep people engaged for some time. Especially those who managed to buy in very cheap late last week will be cashing out profits fairly soon. That doesn\u2019t mean they will destroy all buy support in the process, as some very big buy orders are going through which are not on the order book.

That list encompasses Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and perhaps Litecoin. As far as the Ethereum price is concerned, things are not looking bad nor good right now. A status quo is being maintained, as there is seemingly no interest to push the value up or down in a decisive manner. Weekends have always been rather peculiar when it comes to cryptocurrency market momentum. This weekend has been rather bullish for some markets, and resulted in a status quo for everyone else. Given how negative the past eleven months have been, a bit of stability is more than welcome at this time. It may not seem too appealing, but dealing with massive gains and losses in quick succession grows tiresome after a while. Over the past 24 hours, there hasn\u2019t been any notable change where the Ethereum price is concerned. A minor 0.2% loss in both USD and BTC value is nothing to be overly concerned about The value remains solid at just under $119. Maintaining control over the 0.0325 BTC level is a bit more challenging, but it appears this will sort itself out in the long run. What is pretty impressive is how Ethereum continues to note a hefty trading volume, even during the weekend. With over $2.8bn worth of trades, this token is in very high demand. Although this hasn\u2019t resulted in any major price shifts to take note of, it also shows there is still a demand for the token at the current value. This may also allow ETH to reclaim the #2 market cap rank over the coming days. Some interesting news pertaining to Ethereum is making the rounds at this time. The ERC-1155 token standard will be integrated into the Enjin platform over the coming weeks and months. This is made possible thanks to a collaboration between Kriptomat and Enjin, which marks another impressive milestone for Ethereum as a whole. When this will be finalized exactly, remains to be determined at this time. As has been quite apparent over the past few hours there is no Ethereum chart momentum to speak of. In fact, it has been about as neutral as it gets in crypto land. Not a bad trait by any means, primarily when keeping in mind the significant losses sustained over the past 11 months. A neutral sentiment is always better than a strong sell signal. For the time being, it seems Ethereum is more than capable of holding its own. That in itself comes as a bit of a surprise, as the year 2019 wasn\u2019t off to the best of starts for this token either. However, there may be some genuine long-term momentum brewing as of right now. Long overdue, in the minds of the many, albeit it is still too early to draw any real conclusions.

Albeit most losses have been kept to a bare minimum in most cases, some projects are bleeding value all over the place. The XRP price, for example, is losing more ground to Ethereum and Bitcoin alike. An interesting shift in market cap rankings looms ahead. Despite some positive Bitcoin momentum earlier in the week, it quickly became apparent XRP would not be following suit after all. Although this is somewhat surprising, it is not entirely unexpected either at this stage. There is a genuine disconnect between Bitcoin and XRP, which is what most people have asked for in recent months. Unfortunately for them, it has become apparent this would result in even more negative pressure. Over the past 24 hours, there has been another 2.6% drop for XRP in both USD and BTC value. This latter trend is a logical continuation of momentum building yesterday afternoon. However, the USD loss brings the XRP price down to the $0.303 level again. As such, it would appear a dip below $0.3 is very likely over the coming hours. That would also allow Ethereum to reclaim the second spot in market cap rankings without too many problems. On social media, there are always some interesting developments and discussions pertaining to XRP. Although the overall market trend isn\u2019t exactly promising in the slightest, it would appear there is still some focus on the price regardless. Inter X is keeping a close eye on things, although claiming RIpple and XRP are the exact same \u2013 even in 2019 \u2013 is still rather worrisome in its own regard. MooniaK BougeTonBull raises quite an interesting point when it comes to the current value of XRP. If there is indeed a scheme to get retail investors out in quick succession, lowering the current price isn\u2019t necessarily the best way to go about things either. Instead, pushing the price to a level which would be unappealing to retail investors is a better option, but it has proven difficult to do so. For other users, it is evident there will be some time until XRP hits the $3 level once again. Considering how the current momentum is slowly pushing the value down to $0.3 once again, it would appear not much is happening right now. Even so, there is a good chance this value will improve over the coming weeks and months, albeit it will not happen in spectacular fashion. All of the current market circumstances appear quite bearish for XRP, which is not entirely unexpected. There is a good chance this may be a temporary dip, although that will mainly depend on what traders want to achieve moving forward. Since XRP isn\u2019t that closely correlated to Bitcoin when it comes to an uptrend, no help should be expected from that direction. This article appeared first on NullTX.

That is only normal, yet it also appears as if even more bullish momentum is shaping up right now. All of the top markets continue to note gains, with the Dash price seemingly popping off as of right now. A very remarkable development, considering nothing major is happening behind the scenes. It is pretty interesting to keep an eye on all of the cryptocurrency markets these days. When the momentum turns bullish \u2013 or something close to it \u2013 very interesting changes can be noted in quick succession. It is evident the positive Bitcoin price spell has a big impact on this development, although one has to wonder how long it will remain in place. For now, the positive momentum needs to be appreciated while it lasts. In the case of the Dash price, things have gotten very interesting lately. Following fresh 5.2% gains in both USD and BTC value, there is a notable uptrend where this privacy-oriented altcoin is concerned. As of right now, one Dash is valued at $77.32 or 0.0211 BTC. Both values are more than solid, assuming they can effectively be sustained. For now, that remains to be determined, as there is still some market uncertainty. The social media discussions pertaining to Dash are also pretty interesting to keep an eye on. More specifically, Elicrypto is confident Dash has left the \u201cscam\u201d status behind it once and for all. Even though the project had its doubters on day one, it seems the past few years have proven good things can happen. The same can be said for other currencies such as Ethereum and even Bitcoin. Future Money is convinced now is the time to effectively quit one\u2019s day job and become a full-time Dash trader. While there is an argument to be made for such a statement, there is a good chance people actually following this advice will see their financial future disrupted in more ways than one. Although good money can be made from trading cryptocurrencies, it is not necessarily something one should quit their job over. For those not interesting in simply buying and holding Dash, there are a couple of interesting arbitrage opportunities for traders to take note of. There is an interesting price difference between Koinim, Cex, and Sistemkoin right now. Although the gains are not necessarily all that spectacular, they still represent a profit of roughly $0.7 per Dash per trade. For those throwing some money around, that can easily add up to a few hundred dollars worth of profit over the course of the day. All things considered, it seems Dash is making a valiant effort to effectively maintain its position on the market cap top 15. Based on its current momentum, that rank may effectively improve a bit over the coming hours, although it would be difficult to inch ahead too much further. As such, one has to wonder how high the value can rise after this most recent 5% gain. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

That in itself shows the industry is still attracting a lot of attention, even though it is not necessarily for the right reasons. A new \u201cfree crypto trading bot\u201d is making the rounds, yet it will infect target devices with a Trojan Horse. As the bearish cryptocurrency market seemingly comes to an end right now, it would appear the overall interest in trading assets is rising again. A lot of users would prefer to do so in an automated manner. When prices of cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets rise, it would appear there is also an increase in trading bot popularity. This has become a new industry for criminals to target as of late, by the look of things. More specifically, a new GitHub repository has been discovered which seemingly offers access to a free trading bot. Although there are a fair few bots out there which do not require a monthly subscription fee or something along those lines, this one appears to be designed to cause harm first and foremost. The accompanying YouTube video claims it supports Binance, Cryptopia, and Bittrex at this time. That in itself is a very remarkable development, considering how Cryptopia is shut down indefinitely. Additionally, it seems there are plenty of other options to automate trading on Binance or Bittrex these days. That in itself shows the person responsible for this video hasn\u2019t necessarily put it too much effort in doing some research. Even so, it is very likely this project would have gotten a lot of attention from novice cryptocurrency users. A lot of people want to make money with as little effort as possible. One user noted this GitHub repository isn\u2019t home to just a trading bot, but rather an application designed to spread Trojan Horses to unsuspecting devices. The full impact of these Trojans remains a bit unclear at this time, yet it would appear best to effectively ignore this particular repository and seek trading bots elsewhere. As has been the case in years prior, efforts like these usually serve one of two specific purposes. Either they try to obtain wallet.dat files installed on the infected device and try to steal Bitcoin or altcoins in the process. The second option is to hijack login credentials from a browser session and empty users\u2019 exchange accounts. Which method was designed to be used here, remains unclear. It is known the repository will log user IPs, but the exact purpose of this information remains to be determined. For the time being, it does not appear as if anyone has effectively downloaded and installed this fake free trading bot. That in itself is positive news, although it remains to be seen what the future will hold in this regard. It is unlikely this will be the last attempt to defraud cryptocurrency users with a \u201cfree bot\u201d, as the search for such tools is still intensifying.

Although this altcoin has always been rather popular, its price usually remains on the low side of the spectrum. For some unknown reason, there is heavily inflated LTC trading volume, which may very well push the Litecoin price to $50 over the hours to come. This weekend seems to be a good time to buy, sell, and trade Litecoin. Under the average market circumstances, that is not necessarily the case. Litecoin is, like all other currencies, volatile, but it never goes through significant bull trends for more than a few hours on end. This time seems different, as the second major price spike in three days has been recorded. Over the past 24 hours, there has been another 7% Litecoin price increase. This gain is notable across both the USD and BTC value, which further confirms the interest in this altcoin is genuine. Litecoin has also overtaken EOS in market cap, a development which relegates Bitcoin Cash to outside the top 5 again. Very peculiar movements all around, although not too many people can make sense of it. Social media, while never any accurate source for cryptocurrency trading advice, shows some interesting LTC-themed debates right now. Litecoin Master claims -and this needs to be taken with a grain of salt \u2013 there is massive support for Litecoin at $50. A bit odd, considering this value is currently not reached. While one could argue that level will fall later today, there will be plenty of profit taking along the way. Tortsch-Man shows Litecoin is poised to move up even further. Although a jump from $34 to $46 in just a few days is already pretty impressive, there is room for further gains. At the same time, this is not the time to get greedy and chase the top, as $50 will undoubtedly act as tough resistance for some time to come. Last but not least, it would appear there is plenty of sell pressure shaping up in the past few hours. Coinbase.Pro had over $1m worth of Litecoin for sale just a few minutes ago. That in itself is quite telling, although the current momentum shouldn\u2019t necessarily turn that into much of a roadblock. One never knows what will happen to cryptocurrencies after such a strong gain, though. All things considered, Litecoin is firing on all cylinders right now. Sustaining this momentum has proven difficult, although the previous push did not see most of its gains wiped out in the process. There is still a chance the $50 level will be surpassed, but no one should expect any Litecoin miracles at this time. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Following some surprising developments over the course of the past three days, it seems things may shift into a higher gear. The VeChain price shows there is a lot of positive momentum left in the tank. Solid minor gains across the board spark some community excitement at this time. Although most people have some degree of expectation for Vechain over the coming months and years, its valuation often shows an entirely different sentiment. Most of the time, this token notes an absolutely flat price chart. There is nothing wrong with that aspect, as a lack of volatility can also be a pretty big selling point. Even so, it seems the most recent gains show things move in a decisive direction moving forward. To put this in perspective, there have been some minor VeChain price changes over the past hour or two. Nothing to be overly excited about, yet a 2.6% gain in USD and Bitcoin value is not all that bad either. Because of this minor surge, one VET is now valued at $0.004 or 111 Satoshi. Both levels appear more than respectable, given the current overall market trend. RB3 is keeping a \u201cscoreboard\u201d of cryptocurrencies, tokens, and digital assets these days It would appear VeChain is mentioned in this list primarily because it succeeds in noting some actual gains. Compared to some of the other currencies on the market. VET is doing just fine. Bigger gains might be favorable, but slow and steady will always be the favorable approach. There is some very peculiar trading behavior going on where VeChain is concerned. On Binance, someone has put up a 25 million VET sell wall one Satoshi above a 64m VET buy wall. One would expect traders to either dump into the buy wall or try to suppress the price in a more convincing manner. This behavior will allow for quick profits, though, but it will seemingly not keep the VET price down for long. Crypto News 360 considers VeChain to be one of the most undervalued\u201d coins on the market today. A bit of an odd sentiment, as there are other projects with working tech which sit well below VeChain in terms of market cap. As such, there is plenty of potential in the industry as a whole. Unlocking that potential and turning it into value gains may prove somewhat difficult. Keeping all of this information in mind, it\u2019s not hard to see where the sudden VeChain spike is coming from. While it is not as prevalent as Litecoin or Binance Coin, every small gain needs to be taken into account at all times. For the time being, the token is seemingly in a good place, although that situation can always change if Bitcoin were to turn bearish again. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Especially when Bitcoin moves up or down in a decisive manner, it would appear all market show signs of life either for better or worse. The Holo price is going through some sort of a revival right now, which is rather impressive all things considered. These gains have been expected for some time now, after a bit of a wobbly week. The past few weeks have been pretty interesting for the Holo market in many different ways. Despite some very solid gains several weeks ago, it appeared as if HOT would remain bullish for quite some time to come. This has not been the case after all, primarily because of a correction kicking in shortly after. After hitting 46 Satoshi, HOT went back to 27 in very quick succession. In the past 24 hours, there has been somewhat of a revival for HOT. Although the current price sits still at just 32 Satoshi, that is a net 2.37% increase over the past few hours. There is also a 10% increase in USD value, which mainly stems forth from Bitcoin\u2019s gains. What is rather interesting is how Holo continues to lose value over Ethereum, as a new 1.86% drop has been noted. That is rather uncommon, but there isn\u2019t much one can do about it at this stage. On social media, it would appear there are some interesting discussions involving Holo taking place. First of all, a new YouTube video has surfaced explaining the key differences between Holo the currency and Holochain the technology. While both are interlinked in different ways, they can also succeed separately from one another. Knowing what one is dealing with is always advised prior to making any financial commitments. When it comes to looking at the actual price chart, Holo is seemingly not in the \u201csafe zone\u201d as of yet. To reclaim that status, this altcoin will need effectively push through to 34 Satoshi once again. It may prove to be somewhat difficult to effectively do so, especially when considering how this is the range at which a lot of traders will begin taking profits. The coming days will prove to be crucial in many different ways for Holo, by the look of things. As has become somewhat common in the cryptocurrency world as of late, memes seem to make the world go around first and foremost. Joe Martin is confident Holo will be making its way to the moon fairly quickly, although it remains to be seen what will come next for this particular altcoin in the coming hours. A push the \u201cthe moon\u201d might not necessarily happen anytime soon, for obvious reasons. For the time being, it seems everyone is swept up in the overall bullish momentum. Given how the cryptocurrency markets have evolved in the past eleven months, that isn\u2019t overly difficult to explain either. After so much bearish pressure, any short-term green candle will be well-received. How this will play out for Holo in the long run, remains rather unclear. There is a lot of positive momentum, but there will be some profit taking along the way as well. This post appeared first on Null TX. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Most, if not all altcoins rely on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum for their own valuation. In the case of the Revain price, the current trend is pretty impressive. Following gains in USD, BTC, and ETH value, this altcoin is getting on more people\u2019s radar again. The opinions on Revain may be somewhat mixed most of the time. In some cases, users are convinced this project is the next era of online reviews. Others see it as a pump-and-dump currency which no one should pay much attention to. All of these opinions are valid, but that doesn\u2019t mean there is no money to be made with Revain these days. Over the past 24 hours, there have been very notable changes as far as the Revain price is concerned. To put his in perspective, there is a 12.7% increase in USD value to push the price back to $0.162681. The uptrend also materializes in BTC value, following a 6% increase. Last but not least, Revain gained 2.7% on Ethereum. As has been the case for some time now, this momentum occurs with little to no real trading volume. Although Revain notes nearly $2m in trades, it is not necessarily an amount that displays uber bullish desire to buy this altcoin either. Most top currencies note at least 20% of their market cap in volume every single day. For Revain, that figure is closer to the 5% mark. Not the most impressive, but sufficient. One reason why Revain notes such low trading volume is the exchanges where one can buy, sell, and trade R. Despite being listed on OKEx, HitBTC, and KUCoin, the currency isn\u2019t popular there in the slightest Instead, its top platforms are BTC-Alpha and DragonEX. Neither exchange is \u201cbig\u201d in the industry, thus it seems the overall lackluster trading volume can be explained rather easily. One thing working in favor of this altcoin is the approach taken. Its technology is designed to disrupt the online review industry by building trust between brands and consumers. Whether or not this technology will be in high demand over the coming years, is very difficult to predict. It is a worthwhile topic to explore, though. All things considered, there is no immediate indication this price trend will reverse course. Nor is there any validation to continue the uptrend either, which poses its own set of problems. As such, it seems the goodwill of Revain primarily hinges on how Bitcoin\u2019s price evolves. The hourly charts look a bit bearish in that regard, which can easily spell trouble for all other currencies on the market today. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/cardano-price-hits-0-04-despite-weak-trading-volume/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Cardano Price Hits $0.04 Despite Weak Trading Volume", "content": "Whenever Bitcoin goes through positive momentum, the other markets usually follow suit in quick succession. There will always be exceptions to this unwritten rule, primarily because the altcoin/BTC ratio tends to get disrupted quite a bit. As far as the Cardano price is concerned, things are not looking all that bad right now. Solid improvements in USD and BTC value make for an appealing day of trading. Despite getting a lot of attention last year, it would appear Cardano hasn\u2019t been talked about that much recently. That doesn\u2019t mean the ecosystem isn\u2019t evolving as a whole, but it would appear it is taking a back seat to other topics in the cryptocurrency world. With little to no positive price action to speak of, it is only normal traders and speculators look for profits elsewhere in quick succession. Over the past few hours, however, things have come to a positive change. The Cardano price has risen by 11.6% in USD value, bringing the price to $0.041697. In terms of ADA/BTC, there is a 4.22% improvement as well. It is good to see altcoins move up in Bitcoin value as well, as that is not always a given under these kinds of circumstances. The 1,137 Satoshi level should hold true for some time to come, assuming nothing major happens to Bitcoin itself this weekend. On the social media platforms, the discussions related to Cardano mostly focus on its current price momentum. Not surprising, as all cryptocurrency users have been starving for profits for nearly a full year now. CryptoDucky is convinced Cardano and Litecoin are the good buys for today. An odd sentiment, as both currencies seem to have hit their peak, for the time being. Chasing the top is never a smart idea in the crypto industry. Raf Trading is looking at the current ADA momentum from a slightly different perspective. Although one ADA is now valued at over $0.04, it may not be sufficient to effectively turn this into a new support level. Raf would like to see Cardano push through to the $0.05 level, although it seems unlikely such a major jump will occur over the weekend. One never knows with these volatile markets, though. For those who want to chase some extra profits in the altcoin sector today, arbitrage opportunities are rather plentiful. As far as Cardano is concerned, there are a few interesting price gaps to look into. With potential profits ranging from 0.76% all the way up to 2.2%, there is a lot of good money waiting to be made over the weekend. Exploring any and all options will usually yield the best results in the cryptocurrency industry. When looking at the bigger picture, a potential problem becomes apparent right away. The current Cardano uptrend only materializes because of Bitcoin going through a bullish phase. When that momentum turns around again, it seems likely the ADA value will return to its previous level in pretty quick succession. At the same time, this may very well be the beginning of a new uptrend. The coming days will be quite telling in that regard. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/ethereum-price-targets-120-as-bulls-dominate-the-markets/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Ethereum Price Targets $120 as Bulls Dominate the Markets", "content": "Contrary to what was expected earlier today, it would appear the overall bull trend is still in place today. That in itself is a big surprise, especially when considering how steep the gains were last night. The Ethereum price has turned very bullish of all a sudden, following steep 13% gains across the board. Most people who invested in Ethereum did so at a much higher price than today\u2019s value. While there is nothing wrong with this whatsoever, the current value isn\u2019t instilling much confidence in Ethereum whatsoever. Despite the most recent gains, it is evident this token is still down by 90% from its all-time high. Not the trend speculators have been looking for whatsoever, but there isn\u2019t much to be done about it when Bitcoin is dragging everything else down with it. Over the past 24 hours, the Ethereum price has been on quite the tear. With a 13% gain in USD value, Ether approaches the $120 level once again. This is better compared to sitting in the double-digit range, although that didn\u2019t last all that long either. In ETH/BTC, there is a 5% increase, bringing the value to $0.0325. Not the 0.04 BTC level either, but it is quite interesting to keep an eye on how this particular market evolves. There is nothing really driving the Ethereum value upward other than Bitcoin\u2019s own momentum. After all, Ethereum has become reliant on Bitcoin\u2019s value first and foremost, which has become a big problem in the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Even so, it is pretty interesting to see how the bullish Bitcoin trend breathers new life into all other markets. As long as this run can be sustained, there may be even further gains moving forward. The big news of the week is how a new decentralized Ethereum token exchange has gone live. Known as Bitcratic, it will let users trade ERC20 tokens without too much friction. Platforms like these are dime a dozen, but it is evident there is a genuine demand for them as well. Always conduct one\u2019s own research prior to dealing with these kinds of new solutions, though. It is evident the current momentum has a lot of people excited, for rather obvious reasons. More specifically, Cryptomemez is convinced a major bull run is ahead. While the image in question isn\u2019t photoshopped all that well, it is pretty evident people are genuinely excited about what may come over the weekend. It is difficult to tell how long the excitement will last, though. One thing that can keep the ETH party going is how its trading volume continues to grow. With nearly $4bn in trades, Ethereum is definitely doing some things right. Unfortunately, this also means there is plenty of liquidity which can easily negate most of these gains in very quick succession. This weekend will be pretty crucial for most markets, although the actual impact remains to be determined. This article appeared first on Null TX.

Albeit most of this stems forth from the symbiotic relationship with Bitcoin, it is evident this development wasn\u2019t entirely expected. The XRP price, while not a cryptocurrency, is going pretty strong as well. Retaking the $0.31 level was the first order of business, although there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done. When it comes to digital assets, they often tend to correlate less with Bitcoin\u2019s price momentum. Over the past few months, that has become somewhat of a different story, primarily where XRP is concerned. In fact, this popular asset has virtually been a mirror image of Bitcoin in terms of its price momentum. Not the trend people are looking for by any means. On today\u2019s chart, however, this correlation works in favor of Ripple\u2019s native asset. That in itself is a bit surprising, although it may also be a welcome change of pace. Following a strong 7.1% increase, the value per XRP now sits at $0.3138 again. A big improvement compared to the $0.29 level just two days ago. No uptrend is noted in XRP/BTC, as the asset loses 0.8% in this department. It is evident the current price momentum has taken a lot of people by surprise. Alistrago shares how bullish the chart has become in the past few hours, even though it would appear some negative pressure has begun materializing. Nothing alarming just yet, but this uptrend may not remain in place for long. To put this in perspective, CryptoHawk expects another leg down to materialize fairly soon. This leg down is the precursor of a push to $0.38 or slightly higher in the coming weeks. It is not unlikely this scenario will play out, although these volatile markets tend to prove technical analysis fans wrong virtually every other day. For those who are not willing to chase the XRP top right now, exploring price differences between trading platforms can yield some good money as well. Several arbitrage opportunities have become apparent where this digital asset is concerned. All of the potential profits are more than respectable, even though they may not be available for much longer. All things considered, it would appear there is genuine positive momentum brewing on all fronts. Unfortunately, weekends tend to disrupt the overall market trend in a negative manner. This week may not necessarily be different in that regard, although it is still too early to draw any real conclusions in this regard. This post appeared first on Null TX.

Because of this ongoing trend, alternative markets are rising in value accordingly. The XRP price is not budging all that much, though, and it seems likely it will drop back to #3 in the market cap rankings fairly soon. Positive Bitcoin price momentum usually bodes well for alternative currencies. In the cryptocurrency world, that is usually the unwritten rule. This weekend has proven that is not necessarily always the case. Several markets lose value in Bitcoin or fail to note any real gains of their own. XRP is, surprisingly, one of those markets which simply needs to catch its breath. Although today will not be a repeat of yesterday, the Bitcoin value is still rising. Over the past few months, that has proven to be problematic for XRP. With a 0% change in USD value and a 1.53% loss over Bitcoin, it appears Ripple\u2019s native asset isn\u2019t moving much. It also lost the $0.31 level again. At this rate, Ethereum will reclaim the second spot in market cap rankings without much effort. It would appear a few interesting developments have taken place behind the scenes of XRP once again. Supaahiro decided to set up an XRP ledger validator, a process which is seemingly pretty straightforward. As such, this new validator is now live on the network and can be used by anyone without too many problems. More validators will lead to even further decentralization of this ledger over time. Secondly, one of the peer-to-peer services using XRP \u2013 alongside other major cryptocurrencies \u2013 is planning to expand to 20 additional countries soon. XCh4nge is quite intent on bringing its supported currencies to the masses in this regard. Although this may not impact the price all that much, it is still a noteworthy development to take into account. When gauging the overall XRP sentiment, it would appear there is still positivity in bunches. Barry Curley is convinced XRP will see success \u201ceventually\u201d, although it is difficult to pinpoint an exact date. For other assets, tokens, and currencies, success is all but guaranteed at this point. The coming years will undoubtedly prove very interesting for many different reasons. Although the price doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect it, there is absolutely nothing wrong with XRP in its current state. Community members remain excited and services offering exposure to XRP are expanding in an aggressive manner. That is all one can ask for at this time. None of this will seemingly impact the value per XRP, but building the ecosystem for the future is still valuable. This article appeared first on NullTX.

Some markets show signs of bullish behavior. The Electroneum price, for example, is on the rise over the past few hours. Although this seems rather promising first and foremost, the 200 Satoshi level hasn\u2019t been reached as of yet. The Bitcoin momentum remains very lackluster for quite some time now. Any minor attempt at gaining even 0.1% is usually turned into a net loss for the past eleven months. This usually doesn\u2019t bode well for altcoins, tokens, and digital assets on the market. Although the top markets seemingly feel the pressure right now, the more interesting price action is taking place behind the top 25 right now. Very interesting to keep an eye on, especially for those looking to make some quick money. Over the past few hours, the Electroneum price has risen in a significant manner. In fact, it gained 4.5% in both USD and BTC value, which is pretty interesting to keep an eye on. Because of these fresh gains, the altcoin sits at a value of $0.006745 or 199 Satoshi. Both levels are more than acceptable under the overall circumstances, although there may be some further upward momentum on the horizon. As has been the case for Electroneum for some time now, there is plenty of excitement among its community members. That in itself can turn out to be invaluable, primarily because a strong community can make big things happen. With nearly 3 million registered users right now, it would appear further growth for Electroneum is almost guaranteed. There is also growing dismay regarding the lack of ETN trading on Binance. The biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world seemingly has no real interest in adding this altcoin in the near future. Latin Crypto is convinced ETN might not even need to be on big exchanges when the ecosystem fully comes to market. An interesting train of thought, although one has to wonder if other exchanges won\u2019t pick up on ETN in the near future. Speaking of exchanges, it would appear as if Lukbtc wouldn\u2019t mind seeing a USDT trading pair for Electroneum on the Bittrex exchange. Although Bittrex no longer holds the dominant altcoin trading position it once did, they do support multiple stablecoins for trading against cryptocurrency. As such, there is always a chance additional USDT and TUSD pairs might be added moving forward, although ETN is not necessarily on the list. When looking at the bigger picture, it would appear this trend can remain in place for some time to come. Although Electroneum is effectively bucking the trend suppressing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, one has to keep in mind this might not necessarily be possible for more than a few hours on end. It will be interesting to see what the future holds for ETN in this regard. This article appeared first on Null TX.", "date": "2019-02-08T08:37:59+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 8}

While Bitcoin Lightning Network has tremendous potential, seemingly similar solutions already exist today. Burner Wallet is a very peculiar example, as it allows users to transfer funds via any web browser on any device. A convenient solution which has a ton of future potential. Sending money around the world through cryptocurrencies remains a very big problem. It is anything but convenient to both novice and veteran users. As such, without this ease of use, it seems unlikely cryptocurrencies will play a bigger role of importance moving forward. At least not until new solutions come to market which can address this glaring problem. Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network is such a potential solution. It is an additional layer compatible with the Bitcoin network to successfully make moving BTC around the globe frictionless. Sadly, this technology is anything but frictionless right now, primarily because it requires a fair bit of know-how to even use it. Some wallets have addressed this problem, yet it is still not the solution most consumers will feel comfortable with. Another interesting solution to look into goes by name of Burner Wallet. While it has nothing to do with Bitcoin whatsoever, the underlying concept certainly seems appealing enough. More specifically, it is compatible with any regular browser, which can effectively boost the overall adoption of this technology moving forward. Under the hood, Burner Wallet focuses on letting users transfer xDai through a web browser in a frictionless manner. Users can even sweep their balance to cold storage when they get home, which is pretty interesting to take note of. This entire solution is built on the xDai sidechain, and it also depicts an ETH balance for users to experiment with. While it may not necessarily lead to broader adoption right away, tools like these can prove to be invaluable in the long run. Core functionality provided this wallet includes being able to scan QR codes without a wallet download. Additionally, there is a linking system which can be used to complete transactions in a non-complicated manner. As the gas costs for all transactions are paid for in DAI, they are also significantly lower compared to Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies. Even people who want to accept one-time payments or prefer some form of privacy will see the benefit of this solution. Solutions like these are what may drive mass cryptocurrency and token adoption in the future. While this is a niche-esque product as of right now, that situation can easily change at any given moment. From a convenience point of view, Burner Wallet certainly has a leg up over virtually any other solution on the market. Such a solution for Bitcoin would certainly be interesting to behold, as that may be what this industry needs right now.", "date": "2019-02-08T12:54:27+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 8}

On H1, EOS bounced off the resistance and started going down, although still trying to take down the resistance area. The price may break out $2.43, which will send it higher to $2.57. The Chinese government published its most in-demand crypto rating, where EOS took the first place, and Ether, the second, while the volatile Bitcoin is only 15th out of 34. The rating is mostly based on the tech value and the practical use. In the market cap rating, meanwhile, EOS is 4th, while the first three places go to BTC, XRP, and ETH. The rating houses 100 cryptos, 11 out of them being giants. Fundamentals are mostly positive for the EOS. White hackers found five vulnerabilities within the network over the last few weeks, those issues having been immediately resolved. This was totally financed by EOS who pays the programmers for bug fixing. According to HackerOne, eight bugs have already been fixed since the beginning of this year. Such practice is quite widespread among the crypto companies, while the bug details are not usually disclosed. Over 2018, crypto companies paid $878,000 to the bug fixers, 60% of those being EOS.

Although the overall trend is incredibly bullish, there is a genuine fear this may be another massive bull trap. As $10bn has been added tot he overall market cap in quick succession, sustaining the growth becomes complicated. The EOS price is one of the strongest risers today. While all currencies have been waiting for a Bitcoin bull run, it would appear that is exactly what has materialized over the past few hours. This sudden spike across the board took nearly everyone by surprise, as there hasn\u2019t been any reason to warrant a bull trend. Even so, everything is coloring green right now, which is exactly what enthusiasts have been waiting for. As far as the EOS price is concerned, it seems the gains are piling up rather quickly. More specifically, there is a 15.8% increase in USD value, bringing the price back to $2.72. In EOS/BTC, some strong gains are to be noted as well. A 7.3% gain while Bitcoin grows more bullish is quite interesting in many different regards. Why the value of EOS is going up, remains to be determined at this point. Some interesting developments have become apparent on social media. EOS Authority is the first EOS block validator to reach 23,000 unique votes. A major milestone for this project, but also a positive sign for EOS as a whole. Positive growth often gets price speculators excited. Secondly, it would appear a new scaling solution has become available where this ecosystem is concerned LiquidApps is the name of the project. It can \u201ctrigger a massive shift\u201d, according to the associated YouTube video. There is a lot of room for future growth and potential in the crypto world. Unlocking it has proven to be challenging first and foremost. For those who are not content with the price gains themselves, exploring arbitrage opportunities is a good way to make some extra money. The value of EOS is quite different between some of the bigger exchanges, which allows for easy profits to be pocketed. Although liquidity on Gate and Paribu is not necessarily optimal, there is still room for effortless EOS profits. All of the signs point toward an even more bullish weekend of crypto trading. As has been the case more often than not, however, weekends usually offer completely different market momentum first and foremost. The past weeks have been bearish, which doesn\u2019t mean this week will be any different. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Following a surprise revelation by Binance, it seems xRapid will become even more popular. The XRP price, while still below $0.3, is seemingly rising in value a bit ever since. Many people expected the value of XRP to plummet even further. Once the $0.3 level was broken in quick succession, it quickly became apparent a reversal would not necessarily occur anytime soon. That is always a bit unfortunate, although it seems this popular digital asset will continue to do its own thing first and foremost. To put this in perspective, there is a minor XRP price increase in the past hour or so. It is not something to get overly excited about, although any gain is better than nothing. With this 0.3% rise on both USD and BTC value, XRP is seemingly on its way to reclaim the $0.3 level pretty soon. Regaining control over 9,000 Satoshi will be a different matter altogether, as there is still quite a long way removed from the current value. The big news \u2013 or rumor \u2013 of the week is how Binance\u2019s CEO has allegedly confirmed his interest in xRapid. Because of this development, there is a small chance Binance will partner with Ripple to utilize its xRapid technology in the near future. A very peculiar turn of events, primarily because it would appear this has not been hinted at earlier. For now, it is not officially confirmed either. For those who keep an eye on the bigger picture, it would appear today marks an interesting albeit somewhat sad milestone. It has now been 400 days ago since XRP has hit its latest all-time high. Over a year has gone by filled with volatility and bearish pressure. Turning the situation around will still be difficult, although any minor improvement should be considered to be a victory in its own regard While there is no real reason to party whatsoever, the follow XRP-oriented GIF shows things are not always as dire as they may seem right now. The image itself is pretty interesting in its own regard, primarily because it hints at a party vibe of some sorts. Despite bearish market momentum, there is still plenty of reason to be excited where XRP is concerned these days. When keeping all of this information in mind, it will be interesting to see how things look in a few days from now. Today would be a good of a day as any for more markets to decouple from Bitcoin in rather quick succession. Whether or not XRP is even capable of doing so, is very difficult to predict right now. There is still a lot of bearish pressure in general, which might not necessarily bode well for all of the alternative markets. This article appeared first on Null TX.

Even the Dogecoin price is noting some decent gains for a change, which is pretty interesting all things considered. With this new momentum in place, there is a good chance this run will continue for at least a few more hours. When Bitcoin turns semi-bullish, all other markets will follow suit pretty quickly. That is simply how the cryptocurrency markets work at this time, primarily because everything relies on Bitcoin these days. Dogecoin has often been such an exception, although it seems things are a bit different this time around. To be more specific, it required positive BTC momentum to note any real Dogecoin gains in the process. Over the past 24 hours, the Dogecoin price has noted a 1.3% increase in USD value. This is not spectacular by any means, but one has to acknowledge this recent uptrend is a lot better than seeing another minor collapse. In terms of DOGE/BTC, things are not looking too impressive, although the 0.25% increase is still interesting in its own regard. Contrary to what one might expect, there is no reason for a DOGE value increase right now. The biggest news is how there is a new shirt on Etsy which draw some inspiration from Game of Thrones. Representatives of House Doge may want to pay special attention to this addition, although it will not necessarily influence the price in any meaningful manner. Even though the recent launch of BitTorrent Token is pretty interesting, it seems to spawn some unsavory debates as well. Galathian is drawing a comparison between Dogecoin and BTT, and even goes as far as claiming how DOGE is a \u201cshit coin\u201d. While everyone is entitled to their opinion, statements like these show there is still plenty of work to be done in this industry. Last but not least, the current value may not necessarily seem too enticing to most people. However, there is an arbitrage gap traders can take advantage of for some extra small profits. Dogecoin isn\u2019t maintaining the same value between LiveCoin and Koinim, which makes this trade very straightforward first and foremost. Exploring this option yields a minor profit, but it is still better than nothing. All of the circumstances seem to indicate things will get pretty interesting moving forward. Although the Dogecoin gains are pretty minor at this point, one has to keep in mind these are still the early days of a potential uptrend. After all, it would not be the first time a minor push would be converted into a net loss fairly quickly. For now, caution remains advised, although there is room for minor optimism as well.

Underwritten by the world\u2019s leading insurance provider Lloyd\u2019s of London, the insurance policy insures against theft or loss of any cryptocurrency that is held in an Independent Reserve trading account. It does not, however, cover any losses resulting from market volatility or any losses arising from unauthorized access to trading accounts, such as hacking an individual account or identity fraud. Commenting on the announcement, Adrian Przelozny, CEO and founder of Independent Reserve, said: \u201cInstitutions in Australia and overseas are cautious with regards to investing in cryptocurrencies and issues relating to regulation, price volatility and security are explored in depth. Insurance is the next logical step for our exchange in this fast-maturing industry.

As far as the Basic Attention Token price is concerned, things are not looking all that bad right now. The altcoin has noted some strong gains over the past few hours, primarily due to a new Coinbase campaign. When Bitcoin\u2019s momentum remains somewhat troublesome, it appears to be a matter of time until all other markets follow suit in quick succession. While that has happened quite regularly over the past few days, it seems a reversal may be in order. More specifically, some markets have shown signs of rising in value despite the overall bearish pressure. Over the past 24 hours, the Basic Attention Token price has noted a strong 12.8% gain. There is also a 13% gain over Bitcoin and an 11% improvement over Ethereum. Because of this somewhat unexpected uptrend, the value of BAT has risen to $0.1158 again. This is a pretty decent market trend, considering how most other top markets have either lost value or struggle to maintain their status quo at this time. The main reason for this sudden interest in Basic Attention Token seems to stem forth from Coinbase. The company recently acquired the Earn.com platform and is now rewarding users with cryptocurrency for completing tasks. Their latest venture rewards users with $10 worth of BAT, which seems to have pumped the price a bit in recent hours. One would expect recipients to dump their tokens, but that is not happening as of right now. In fact, it seems this campaign has the opposite effect. A lot of people are now trying out the Brave browser as part of this Earn requirement. As such, they seem to mainly take a liking to what this new browser has to offer. At the same time, Brave still doesn\u2019t support most of the common themes, plugins, or tools other major browsers provide. As such, it\u2019s push to mainstream adoption will take a while longer, yet this appears to be a good start. KC Crypto investing is one of the people who is seemingly smitten by the Brave browser experience. While that is somewhat understandable, it remains to be seen if this interest remains in place once the hype surrounding this BAT promotion wears off. For the time being, that question remains difficult to answer, but it is certainly a possibility moving forward. With so many \u201cfree\u201d BAT tokens entering the market, one would expect the price to dump. However, it remains to be seen if people will effectively use this token for the browser-based purposes or decide to invest in Basic Attention Token because of the future potential. For the time being, there is no reason to expect an immediate trend reversal, although anything can happen in this volatile industry. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

The markets which proved to be profitable a few weeks ago are now just bleeding value like the rest. In the case of the Holo price, the pressure is getting very intense lately. Fresh steep losses across the board bring the price down to $0.001163. Although it was to be expected, the Holo value momentum could not be sustained for very long. Despite seeing some very prominent gains in recent weeks, the bearish pressure has increased in a significant manner as well. This has become more than apparent over the past week, even though the uptrend still seemed intact as of yesterday. Today, the steep drop off is becoming more apparent by the hour. Over the past 24 hours, the Holo price has declined by 10.7% in USD value. There is also a decline of 9.3% in BTC value and a 7.2% deficit in ETH value. This is one of the few currencies losing less value over Ethereum compared to Bitcoin, for some reason. Even so, that alone is not sufficient to keep the value above 35 Satoshi or $0.0012. Instead, the drop to $0.001163 may very well be the beginning of what is yet to come for this altcoin. Paul Jones would like to see Holo and Cardano be added to the Wirex application and wallet infrastructure. While that request makes a lot of sense, the company hasn\u2019t confirmed \u2013 nor denied \u2013 they are looking into this matter as of right now. There will be an app update later in February, although the specifics remain somewhat unclear. Even so, there may be some surprises around the corner, for all one knows. The big news of this week is the impending launch of HoloPort. This technology has been touted for quite some time now, yet it seems an actual release date is almost upon the community. It is expected this plug-and-play device will be in high demand to support the distributed internet. Definitely something worth keeping an eye on, as physical crypto-related products are always interesting. Last but not least, there is still a lot of excitement for the Junto project. This new decentralized form of social media is currently being funded through a Kickstarter campaign. Junto will make use of Holo\u2019s infrastructure, including Holochain and potentially the HoloPorts mentioned above. So far, the campaign has seen mild interest, but there is always room to raise more money. Even though things are coming together nicely behind the scenes of Holo, the actual price isn\u2019t moving in the same direction. This is not too surprising, as there has been overwhelming bearish pressure on the industry as a whole. As such, it isn\u2019t surprising to see this momentum affect Holo as well, albeit that may only be temporary, for the time being. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

That is only normal, as one has to wait until Bitcoin moves up again before the rest can follow. Despite facing a lot of other pressure as well, the NEM price is currently going through a bullish period. Solid gains across the board push the value up quite nicely at this stage. There are a lot of things to be concerned about where NEM is concerned. Although the underpinning technology still works just fine, the NEM Foundation may meet its demise fairly soon. The recently announced expected budget cuts confirm how big the bearish market is impacting different projects all over the world. Although the development of NEM will continue without too many problems, it is putting a lot of strain on this market. Over the past 24 hours, the NEM price has risen by 10% in both USD and BTC value. A bit of a surprising development, especially when considering how Bitcoin is still stuck in sideways trading. The recent push brings the NEM value back to $0.0037981. In Bitcoin terms, the price has returned to 1,114 Satoshi, which looks a lot better compared to just a few weeks ago. This doesn\u2019t mean the bull run will be continued indefinitely, though. On social media, there is some more news regarding the current NEM Foundation problems. More specifically, it has been calculated 210 million tokens will need to be bought to keep the development ongoing by 2020. It would cost roughly $5m to effectively do so. Assuming prices won\u2019t move up between now and then, the coming two years will undoubtedly put a lot of negative pressure on a lot of projects. When looking at the actual price chart right now, it quickly becomes evident the daily top may have already been reached. When the price peaked at just over 1,115 Satoshi, there was a very sharp retrace almost immediately. Even though a new rebound followed afterward, this up-and-down momentum cannot be sustained for very long. Those who made a profit will undoubtedly get out pretty soon, based on the current overall market trend. There has been a recent discussion on Twitter regarding tipbots and cryptocurrencies. Although many people wouldn\u2019t mind seeing a Bitcoin-oriented version of this implementation, there is a precedent already. NEM Has seemingly been involved in some sort of trial to do exactly this, although it is a bit unclear if that involved social media tipping on a large scale. Even so, there is an argument to be made for using different currencies in correlation with Twitter tipbots. All of the market signals send a rather bearish outlook for altcoins and tokens. However, the NEM chart clearly shows this trend can be bucked without too many problems. Sustaining any uptrend has proven nigh impossible for altcoins throughout 2019, but things can always change at any given moment. For the time being, it seems as if the NEM uptrend might remain in place for a few more hours, assuming the trading volume doesn\u2019t collapse all of a sudden.

Following strong fresh gains, the Binance Coin Price is firing on all cylinders once again. Now that it successfully surpassed $8 again, it will be interesting to see what will happen over the coming hours. It is always interesting to see how different markets deal with the overall industry-wide trend. Whereas Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are all in the red again, more exciting things are happening a bit further down the list. Binance Coin, while still in the market cap top 10, is going through somewhat of a bullish surge right now. This is quite intriguing, simply because it is so averse compared to all other markets. Over the past 24 hours, the Binance Coin price has gained nearly 15% in USD value, bringing the price to $8.11. There are strong gains in BTC and ETH value as well. One BNB is now priced at 0.00236 BTC or 0.779 ETH. Especially this latter ratio is rather interesting. Ethereum keeps losing ground compared to virtually every market it can be traded against these days. That is not a positive sign by any means, but it is how things work as of right now. Even though the momentum remains positive, this might not necessarily be the top for BNB just yet. Trading Room has identified two key targets for this token moving forward, with the second one sitting above the $9 mark. Although that would require another 10% increase, it is not necessarily impossible by any means. Vanessa B seems to echo a very similar sentiment, although there has been some resistance forming on the chart as well. Following some steeper gains earlier this morning, there was a quick push downward to ensure these gains would not get out of hand right away. That is only normal, considering such steep gains can\u2019t be sustained for very long in most cases. So far, it seems the uptrend will be resumed without too many problems. One remarkable aspect of this current surge is how most of the trading volume seemingly takes the form of Bitcoin. More specifically, BNB appears to generate more BTC-related trading volume compared to Ethereum, XRP, and other markets. A very intriguing development, although it remains to be seen how long this situation will remain in place. Even so, it is a promising sign at this time. When keeping the current overarching market momentum in mind, it seems unlikely things will remain this positive for Binance Coin. At the same time, this token has a habit of completely bucking the market trend and doing its own thing in the process. As such, there is always a chance this run may remain in place for a few more hours. Speculators will undoubtedly be quite pleased with the way things are going right now.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/should-you-buy-bittorrent-token-btt-right-now/", "author": "Mark", "title": "Should You Buy BitTorrent Token ($BTT) Right Now?", "content": "The latest hype in 2019 is by all means BitTorrent Token ($BTT). After selling out on Binance in under 14 seconds the cryptocurrency has seen a tremendous rise since its listing on the Binance exchange. The value more than triple since it\u2019s starting value of roughly 14 satoshis. Currently $BTT is trading at 26 satoshis after reaching an all time high of 37 sats. The biggest question right now is for those that missed the boat is it worth purchasing the token at this time. Before I go any further I want to reiterate that this article should not be used as financial advice. I\u2019m not a financial adviser and not a master trader, if I knew the right answer I wouldn\u2019t be here writing this article. I will present both the pros and cons of purchasing $BTT at the current price of 26 satoshis and you can decide for yourself what to do. Let\u2019s start with the Pros: There is massive hype surrounding $BTT right now. Justin Sun is still busy pumping the token on his twitter account which could mean a further influx of investors in the next few days. There are rumors of major celebrities coming on board including an athlete that was 4 super bowl titles. Here is an example of one of Justin\u2019s recent tweet: Currently it would take roughly 1900 BTC in order to move the price down 20%. While possible, it would be extremely difficult and would require quite a few people dumping the token at a loss. It\u2019s obvious that the BitTorrent Token market is correcting from its all time high. An inexperienced trader will make decisions based on emotion and most of the time panic sell when a crypto is going down and FOMO buy on the way up. A seasoned trader will usually do the complete opposite, buy when the market is correcting and most people are scared, and sell on the way up trying to catch the top. Besides the hype, BitTorrent is responsible for over 22% of internet traffic in the world. $BTT is a big deal and will be supported by the largest network any cryptocurrency has ever laid its hands on. Whether you believe in the hype or not, you can\u2019t argue that the token will have an actual use case on a huge network. Now that we outlined some pros of potentially getting into a position with $BTT, let\u2019s go over the bad news: Looking at the Binance chart, the MA(7) line is just now crossing the MA(25) line. What that means is the short term moving average is crossing below the long term moving average. In technical analysis that signifies more bearish momentum ahead. The two indicators first crossed back at 13 satoshis and the market played along by rising almost 300%. As Moon Overlord mentioned on twitter, Justin bought $BTT for $140 million and the market cap of the token is already overvalued at over $150 million. While that in itself doesn\u2019t define the token\u2019s price, it\u2019s a good gauge to see the potential worth of the cryptocurrency at least in the short term. As we mentioned in the pros section, there is massive buy support for the token. The same is true for the resistance, there are massive sell orders already in place on Binance. To put things in perspective, it would take around 1200 BTC for the price to move up to 32 satoshis or 20%. With so many orders in place, moving the market will take a huge amount of volume. Nothing that can\u2019t be achieved with the amount of attention $BTT is currently receiving but something that is definitely worth keeping in mind. Bitcoin is still suffering from crypto winter. Whether it will come to an end anytime soon is anybody\u2019s guess. However, it\u2019s important to understand that if BTC\u2019s value drops, so does $BTT\u2019s value. While that\u2019s also true for any other cryptocurrency, the overall market sentiment is not helping $BTT in any way. So there you have it, based on the points mentioned above would you pull the trigger and purchase some $BTT? Personally I\u2019m going to wait on the sidelines and see what unfolds. I do believe that there it\u2019s highly unlikely for $BTT to double in price anytime soon, so the risk of entering into a position outweights the potential reward.

The Holo price is still in the green, even though the current one-hour candles look anything but promising. Even so, this altcoin continues to buck the overall trend affecting most markets today. That in itself is pretty intriguing to keep an eye on over the coming days. It is always interesting to see how specific cryptocurrencies survive the weekend. Especially when considering how Bitcoin still dictates the pace of all other markets right now. That is quite an annoying correlation more often than not, as it is evident Bitcoin will not necessarily see much of an uptrend for the foreseeable future. Even so, currencies like Holo successfully buck this downtrend, by the look of things. Over the past 24 hours, there has been another minor Holo price improvement. Although it is not necessarily the biggest change to get investors and speculators excited, any development in a positive manner will be appreciated. With the 2.6% gain in USD value, one HOT is now priced at $0.001214. There\u2019s also a 3% gain in BTC value and 4% leap over Ethereum. The 35 Satoshi level may hold for another day, although a return to 40 is out of the question for now. On social media, there has never been any lack of excitement or hype for Holo and its underpinning Holochain technology. Lionel is confident there is a genuine chance HOT will reach $1 in a few years from now. That \u201cprediction\u201d also seems to indicate no major bull run needs to be expected for the top currencies in the coming weeks Not necessarily the message everyone was waiting for, but that is the way things look right now. For those keeping a very close eye on the price chart on Binance, an interesting trend has begun forming. Although Holo has plenty of sell walls up, none of them seem insurmountable with a bit of effort. Unfortunately, these walls usually get padded once a certain level has been surpassed, and it appears this time will not necessarily be different whatsoever. For now, chasing the top is not advised, as 35 Satoshi may very well be the limit under the current market circumstances. As is usually the case in the cryptocurrency world, memes keep the bad dreams away when the overall market trend remains bearish. In the case of Holo, there is an interesting meme shared by Fat Elvis. Although it is not necessarily the best way to illustrate the importance of holding one\u2019s asset during the negative trend, it is still a funny meme regardless. All of this further shows the cryptocurrency ecosystem is still not in the best of places right now. There is too much bearish pressure to warrant any real uptrends these days, yet it remains to be seen if any currency can continue to buck the overall trend. So far, Holo is putting up a valiant fight, albeit it seems unlikely this positive run will remain in place for much longer. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

A new project shows up every single day and can be successful for a brief period of time. In the case of Bitcoiin, it shouldn\u2019t be confused with Bitcoin. This clone project is currently turning very bullish, resulting in a Bitcoiin price of over $1. A remarkable development, for many different reasons. It is not uncommon for altcoins and unknown projects to have their value pumped by market makers. Up until now, very few people had even heard about Bitcoiin. It turns out this project is indeed real and currently in the cryptocurrency market cap top 75. That in itself is a very surprising development, especially when considering how it only recently entered the market. Over the past 24 hours, the Bitcoiin price has risen by over 280% in both USD and Bitcoin value alike. That in itself further confirms this is a massive pump first and foremost, primarily because all of this is happening with just $2.77m in trading volume. With its market cap now surpassing $54.3m, Bitcoiin effectively is ranked $63 by market cap. For a currency only listed on Exrates, DigiFinex, and other minor exchanges, this trend is quite intriguing. On social media, it quickly becomes evident this Bitcoiin pump might not necessarily remain in place for much longer. More specifically, the sharp rise in value is reminiscent of what is happening to Vexanium and Fire Lotto, which are two other crypto projects without clear and concise use cases to improve upon the current level of mass adoption. Quickly entering the crypto market cap top 100 like this is a clear sign the price isn\u2019t rising naturally. While the team confirms there are major partnerships being formed and mobile wallets to be released, it remains to be seen if they can effectively deliver on that promise at any given time. Making empty promises is pretty easy, especially in the cryptocurrency world. Speaking of which, it would appear Bitcoiin will be making its way to another top 10 exchange \u201cvery soon\u201d. Which exchange that will be or why any top exchange would even list this project, remains unclear at this time. For now, it is best not to chase the top where this altcoin is concerned, as that will only cause potential financial issues moving forward. When looking at the bigger picture, it quickly becomes evident Bitcoiin will see a major correction in the very near future. How all of this will pan out for anyone who effectively invested in this project, remains to be determined. There is a very genuine chance the price will crash down pretty hard in the coming hours and days. When that happens, Bitcoiin will drop out of the market cap top 100a gain pretty quickly.

For those people who like to watch the Litecoin price charts, the current momentum will be a welcome sight first and foremost. Although this uptrend seemingly won\u2019t last all that long, every brief spell of positive momentum is welcomed with open arms. Although the value of Litecoin primarily hinges on what happens to Bitcoin, it seems this symbiotic relationship works in favor of the altcoin sometimes. In the case of Litecoin, there is a small gain in both USD and BTC value over the past few hours. Combined with a relatively strong trading volume, the altcoin appears to be in a good place prior to heading into the weekend. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a 4.8% gain in USD value. because of this rather solid uptrend, one LTC is now priced at $33.08 once again. There is also a 3.7% increase in BTC value, as the LTC/BTC ratio now sits at 0.00946 Bitcoin again. A jump to 0.01 Bitcoin seems unlikely, although one never knows what the weekend will bring. On social media, it quickly becomes apparent there is no real technical or merchant development affecting the current interest in Litecoin. In fact, all everyone talks about is the current price and where it might head next over the weekend. Crypto Capital Venture seemingly considers a new all-time high may be on the horizon, although that will primarily depend on Bitcoin. So far, the cards are not lining up correctly. Taylor, on the other hand, is resorting to different matters when it comes to Litecoin\u2019s value. This user is simply praying for a retest of the support level. A bit of a more down-to-earth approach to the current market momentum, albeit it remains to be seen if the support can hold its own in this regard. Weekends have turned out pretty bearish for all currencies as of late, thus this week may not necessarily be any different. For those who do not want to wait until the market makes up its mind, other money making methods are well worth exploring. Arbitrage trading can make traders a lot of good money in exchange for very little effort. The pairs below offer some interesting options, as most of the platforms involved usually provide decent liquidity. As such, the profits are literally ripe for the taking. With all of this uneasy market momentum still in place, it seems rather unlikely the coming days will yield significant changes in a positive manner. At the same time, it is due time some of the top altcoins decouple themselves from Bitcoin in a decisive manner. Whether or not Litecoin will be one of the first to do so, remains to be determined. It would certainly shake the market up in a positive manner. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

It is evident a reversal is more than needed, yet it will not necessarily happen in the near future. For the Stellar price, things are not looking all that great now. More specifically, it would appear the negative pressure will continue to reign supreme for some time to come. For an industry in which most offerings rely on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum, it is evident things are not going too well right now. That situation may not necessarily change in the near future either. As long as Bitcoin can\u2019t note any real gains, the losses will continue to pile up. For Stellar and other markets, that is a worrisome outlook to keep in mind. It also shows things will not necessarily improve moving forward. Over the past 24 hours, there has been further negative pressure on the Stellar price. Following another 3.25% loss in USD value, one XLM is now valued at $0.0785. The XLM/BTC ratio hasn\u2019t improved either in the past few hours. A fresh 3.8% decline for that ratio pushes the value to 2,265 Satoshi. It is not the activity traders are looking for right now. Sadly, it seems this trend will continue for quite some time to come. There is still some support for XLM to keep in mind. According to Coin Kilavuz, XLM should be run as long as it remains above $0.07. So far, that hasn\u2019t posed any real problems, but the \u201csafe buffer\u201d continues to shrink every single day. As long as that level isn\u2019t broken, a fresh push to $0.125 can materialize at some point in 2019. Failure to support this level can spell all kinds of trouble. Astanto seems convinced there will be a new bull trend in 2019. Although pinpointing the exact date and time will be difficult under the current circumstances, one has to acknowledge this negative pressure should relent sooner or later. Slow and steady often wins races, even in the world of cryptocurrency and digital assets. As such, this temporary pressure should not be of great concern to long-term investors and speculators. Even though the current momentum doesn\u2019t warrant any real positivity, there are other ways to make money. More specifically, there are a few minor arbitrage opportunities involving XLM to take advantage of right now. It is a more than welcome alternative given the current market conditions, although the potential profits aren\u2019t exactly stellar either. One thing seemingly hindering XLM\u2019s momentum is the rather low trading volume. For a top 10 asset ranked by market cap, below $100m in volume is rather poor. It seems to confirm the overall interest in all markets is dropping off significantly, although that may just be a temporary setback. Until things pick up in a significant manner, reaching $0.1 again seems virtually impossible where XLM is concerned. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Whereas Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are all struggling for any genuine traction, Tron seems to be enjoying a very positive spell right now. The current Tron price sits at $0.0267 again, following a minor value spike. An interesting development which seems to be linked to BitTorrent Token. It is not entirely uncommon for the top cryptocurrencies, tokens, and assets to bleed value during and after a weekend of trading. In fact, that is pretty common in 2019, by the look of things. Whereas Bitcoin and Ethereum are not noting any real gains whatsoever, Tron is taking a very opposite approach. Its value is, while only modestly going up, still rising. This trend has been apparent for over a week now and shows no signs of slowing down again. Over the past 24 hours, the Tron price has risen by 3.2% in both USD and Bitcoin value. The current price point of $0.0267 is promising. A lot of traders will keep an eye on TRX/BTC, as most people trade altcoins to increase their Bitcoin holdings first and foremost. So far, that ratio sits at 776 Satoshi, which is well below the 800 Satoshi level most traders would like to see at this time. As of right now, the main Tron-related discussions pertain to the BitTorrent Token. Although BitTorrent has gotten a bad reputation over the years, the protocol itself can be used for legal purposes as well. The Tweet below illustrates that point rather aptly. BitTorrent is a trustless P2P communication protocol for sending and receiving files across the globe. How the BTT token will impact that aspect, remains to be seen. Crypto Music \u2013 TRX is confident this is only the beginning for a future Tron and BTT price gain. Both markets seem to be performing quite well, even though most of the TRX/BTC gains in this screenshot have been eroded already. A super bullish 10% gain one-hour candle caused a lot of brief excitement, although most people knew things would not continue down that line for very long. The actual TRX price chart illustrates this point rather well. A massive spike occurred from 726 Satoshi all the way to 841, but it was quickly met with a massive reversal. Although it remains to be seen if this is the new support level or if further losses will be happening in the coming few hours. A complete reversal to 726 Satoshi isn\u2019t out of the question as far as Tron is concerned, Although one can easily see why there is so much excitement regarding Tron, the price momentum will not necessarily hold true. In fact, as most as the gains are already wiped out completely, it would appear the reversal is waiting to happen. The BitTorrent token release will undoubtedly spark further debates in the coming months, although that might not necessarily impact the value of TRX itself.

As Bitcoin shows some minor bullish signs again, nearly all top market shave turned green. For Litecoin price watchers, the past few hours have proven to be rather interesting as well. Solid gains across the board brought the value back up to $32.09, which seems to act as the new support level. Although there hasn\u2019t been too much Litecoin action throughout the first month of 2019, the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold remains within the market cap top 7. Although its total cap has shifted below $2bn again, it seems to be a matter of time until that level can be reclaimed successfully. The current gains during the early hours of January 31st indicate there is some genuinely bullish momentum building. Most of this stems forth from Bitcoin rising in value again, though. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a 3% increase in Litecoin\u2019s value. In LTC/BTC terms, there is also a 2% shift in favor of the altcoin. Both trends come at the most opportune time for this particular currency. After facing some steep setbacks in the first three weeks of the new year, it now seems the Litecoin price will try to cling to the $32 level as support. Reaching 0.01 BTC again will pose a completely different challenge, though. The recent Litecoin price action also sparks some interesting debates on social media. Litecoin certainly lacks real innovation to speak of, even though it successfully implemented SegWit and the Lightning Network in recent years. Overall, the development seems to lean toward the \u201cinactive\u201d side of the spectrum, which is often a point of critique where Litecoin is concerned. At the same time, there are those who sing the praises of Litecoin in terms of how it is evolving behind the scenes. It would appear there is a rumor regarding how LTC will implement Confidential Transactions in the near future. A privacy-oriented aspect in Litecoin is something most people wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect anytime soon, yet it can be quite a valuable addition to this popular altcoin as well. Wolf makes a pretty interesting comment regarding the value of LTC at this time. Even though there is no real shilling going on to speak of \u2013 nor any real pump efforts \u2013 the altcoin seems to break the resistance level in an almost casual manner. That in itself is pretty interesting to keep an eye on, although one has to wait and see if this uptrend can be sustained for more than a few hours on end. The jury is still out on this one. Although there appears to be sufficient Litecoin trading volume to keep this party going, all it takes is one bearish Bitcoin candle. It is uncanny how many markets rely on Bitcoin\u2019s price momentum right now. What will come next for Litecoin, remains to be determined, as there is a good chance things will turn around at any given moment. No major dips seem to be in order, although that doesn\u2019t mean the price will remain in the green. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

As Bitcoins momentum remains rather shaky, anything can happen over the coming days and weeks. The VeChain price looks ready to move up once again, even though it will mainly depend on what happens to Bitcoin. For now, things are seemingly coming together. It is always difficult to make any accurate predictions when it comes to dealing with altcoins and tokens. These markets often tend to follow a very unusual price path first and foremost. While a lot of people have high hoped for VeChain in 2019, it remains to be seen if that \u201chype\u201d can be justified. Some of the recent behind-the-scenes developments seem to confirm things are coming together. Influencing the price, however, is a different matter altogether. Over the past 24 hours, it would appear as if some excitement has begun brewing. The VeChain price noted a 5.2% gain in USD value and gained 4% on Bitcoin itself. Both trends are pretty bullish, under these circumstances. It is also thanks to these short-term gains how the VET price successfully retook the $0.004 level without any real problems. The 116 Satoshi value is also pretty interesting to keep an eye on. There is one pretty big development to keep an eye on where VeChain is concerned. More specifically, it would seem as if Safe Haven has successfully integrated the ThorPay Alpha on the VeChainThor blockchain. This is a pretty big step forward to taking this altcoin to the next level in the coming months. Although it is not officially live just yet, a closed beta test is expected to follow in the near future. Even though it appears as if some people are excited about VeChain, there are others who are not too convinced. This is a pretty common trend in the crypto world, and one that seemingly affects VeChain as well. CryptoProfitGroup is convinced Vechain is a \u201cshitcoin\u201d. A bit of an odd sentiment, although one has to wonder if there would be any sentiment to this particular stance. When looking at the actual price chart right now, it would appear there may be some bearish VeChain momentum in the near future. More specifically, there is a chance this altcoin is already teetering on the border of the \u201coverbought territory\u201d, which would signal an impending correction. For the time being, the chart can head in any direction, which will keep speculators on their toes. Based on all of these developments and trends, it would appear the current uptrend is more than warranted. The ThorPay news is quite interesting to keep an eye on. As is always the case, altcoin-oriented payment solutions usually do not gain much traction, thus it remains to be seen whether or not there will be any real repercussions. Chasing the top is always a bad idea, especially because VeChain\u2019s top may have already been reached. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Although there is a genuine lack of overall momentum right now, it would appear there are still some surprising market movements. For fans of the Holo price, looking away has proven to be the best option this week. The value continues to plummet at a more than alarming rate, with no real improvements in sight. It is not entirely uncommon to see how the value of Holo continues to drop over the past few hours. Although this altcoin has had a good run just last week, those massive gains were about to be wiped out in spectacular fashion. It now appears the downtrend will continue for quite some time to come, primarily because there is no reason for this market to note any recovery at this time. Over the past 24 hours, the Holo price has dropped by another 14.5% all across the board. The USD setback brings the value down to $0.001065. In Bitcoin value, Holo dropped to the 31 Satoshi level again, although it is certainly possible a further decline looms on the horizon. This is not the trend traders and speculators are looking for, although there is not much one can do about the current lay of the land, so to speak. There is some positive news for Holo which could result in a minor uptrend over the weekend. Getting listed on new exchanges is paramount to improve overall liquidity of a cryptocurrency. In the case of HOT, it is now listed on the Turkish Paribu exchange. Deposits and withdrawals will go live today, with the marketplace opening for trading a few hours later. This is a pretty big development for this altcoin, although it remains to be seen if it affects the price at all. When looking at the actual price chart, however, it quickly becomes apparent there is no real improvement in sight. The chart provided by HEG shows there is a good chance this current level will not act as support and a further decline looms on the horizon. Dropping to $0.000666 isn\u2019t entirely out of the question, by the look of things, which could spell trouble for Holo in the long run. A completely different price chart is shared by Michael Bed, who remains confident this is just a flesh wound for Holo. More specifically, he expects a steep increase to 58 Satoshi in the future. When that trend will materialize exactly, is a different matter altogether. Based on the current overall circumstances, it seems incredibly unlikely such a price increase is even possible. Even so, cryptocurrencies remain incredibly unpredictable first and foremost. Although the opinions on Holo are still somewhat all over the place, it would appear the current negative price momentum will remain in place for the foreseeable future. That isn\u2019t just native to Holo either, as all other cryptocurrencies seem to suffer from this particular setback right now. How these markets will evolve in the hours and days to come, is anybody\u2019s guess. Everything is possible, but no miraculous uptrend looms on the horizon.

The top markets try to recover losses sustained yesterday. Further down the rankings, other projects note strong gains out of the blue. The MobileGo price is soaring right now, especially because of its strong gains during this extensive bear market. It is always interesting to see how individual cryptocurrency markets deal with the overwhelming pressure. As far as altcoins and tokens are concerned, it is evident things can easily swing either way without too many problems. As far as MobileGo is concerned, it seems the sky is the proverbial limit at this time. Although one has to wonder if this uptrend is sustainable for the long run, speculators will be quite happy with these developments. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a notable MobileGo price increase. Following a 28% gain in USD value and a 30% gain over both Bitcoin and Ethereum, MGO is doing quite well. Surprisingly well, even, especially when considering how there is a lot of pressure on Bitcoin and the other top markets. Because of this strong uptrend, one MGO is now valued at $0.3125. This is still a long way removed from the all-time high, yet still a notable trend regardless. What is perhaps most interesting is how there is just $9.32m in 24-hour trading volume at this point. Most of this volume seems to come from the BitForex and DigiFinex exchanges, which is pretty interesting to keep an eye on. Neither of those exchanges is pretty \u201cbig\u201d in terms of overall traction, although it may not necessarily be sufficient to keep the current trend going moving forward. One has to keep in mind Coinrail is perhaps the \u201cmost mainstream\u201d exchange for MGO right now, yet it generates $0 in volume right now. The big news of the week comes in the form of a new gateway between MobileGo and Metamask. This is a pretty big development for the altcoin\u2019s ecosystem as a whole, although it might not necessarily be sufficient to warrant this steep price increase. Even so, it seems this is the primary reason as to why the current price is moving up pretty quickly. It may also be due to speculators looking to pump something differently, though. For those who are merely interested in the price itself, it would appear MobileGo is one of the three strongest risers of the day. That in itself is pretty interesting to take note of, especially under the current market circumstances. Whether or not this price run can be sustained for more than a few hours, is a different matter altogether. Right now, that seems likely, but it is a matter of time until holders start taking profits as well. When looking at the overall market conditions, the current MGO price trend seems pretty much unsustainable as of right now. At the same time, there are a lot of Bitcoin holders who will jump on any opportunity to increase their BTC holdings in the coming days. It now appears MobileGo is a good option to explore, although chasing the top is never a smart decision either. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

This cycle has repeated itself quite regularly over the past few months. One notable exception is Binance\u2019s own token. The Binance Coin price has risen by 5% over the past few hours, effectively bucking the overall market trend. To put the current crypto market momentum into perspective:: no one should expect surprising uptrends for the foreseeable future. All markets seem to follow Bitcoins pattern once again, although it remains to be seen why this is the case exactly. One interesting trend is how Binance Coin continues to do its own thing without too many problems. In fact, it continues to gain value whereas all other markets are facing a lot of negative pressure. Over the past 24 hours, the Binance Coin price has risen by 5% in USD value and gained 6.4% over Bitcoin. As has been the case for some time now, the gains over Ethereum are even bigger at 8.5%. Ethereum is losing a lot of ground in its own right and to other currencies as well. Because of these gains, one BNB is now valued at $6.46 again, which seems to be on par with what most speculators had expected heading into the weekend. On social media, it would seem there is a lot of positive momentum where Binance Coin is concerned. More specifically, MoJo Crypto would love to see BNB being used as a way to pay people in cryptocurrency moving forward. That in itself is a rather remarkable decision, although there is also a case to be made here. Whether or not it can serve a purpose in this regard, remains to be seen. MaxD is looking at the Binance Coin market as a good way to buy in at a lower price. Although his buy targets were hit quite some time ago, it seems those who managed to buy in at that particular value will be quite happy with their current profits. There is no immediate reason to cash out the profits either, primarily because this uptrend may very well be extended for some time to come. There is also some further excitement regarding Binance\u2019s recent payment method announcement. More specifically, it quickly became apparent the platform is integrating credit card payments, which can boost overall adoption of Bitcoin and altcoins alike. Whether this will impact the value of BNB, is a very different matter altogether. Anything is possible, but for now, the two aspects need to be put in different spotlights. When keeping all of this information in mind, it will be interesting to see what happens over the weekend. A bearish Bitcoin price trend is usually problematic in its own regard, although it seemingly will not affect Binance Coin in any notable manner. At the same time, this currency may see it sown bearish run over the weekend while other projects recover. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/what-is-grin/", "author": "Zane Huffman", "title": "What Is Grin?", "content": "On January 15, the Grin mainnet went live, and it\u2019s captured the attention from supporters and speculators across the space since. One of the pioneers behind MimbleWimble tech, Grin\u2019s unwavering focus to privacy and scalability has presented a fresh project and point of interest for enthusiasts to observe. Just two days after launch, Theymos announced that Grin was to be accepted for Bitcointalk forum payments, the first currency beyond Bitcoin to achieve this status. With the support of several other longstanding community members, word of this project spread like wildfire. When it first hit exchanges, GRIN was trading at over US$250 per coin. After retracing significantly to the US$3-4 mark, it\u2019s started climbing once more, up almost 300% this week with a current price of $13 per coin, setting the market cap to roughly US$13 million at time of writing. To get an idea of what exactly Grin is, a good place to start is the comprehensive list of everything Grin is not. For those looking, a few objects in the list probably stick out as peculiar: no addresses, no transaction history, no fixed supply, among others. Obviously, Grin is quite different from many of the other projects in the space. But how, exactly, can Grin function as a cryptocurrency without any of these seemingly key components? MimbleWimble, a concept introduced in 2016 by Tom Elvis Jedusor, drawing inspiration from Greg Maxwell\u2019s proposed confidential transactions, acts as a stripped-down blockchain alternative that promotes maximum privacy and scalability, eliminating bloat in all other capacities. Unlike Bitcoin, whose transactions are stored forever, Grin\u2019s implementation of MimbleWimble indicates that transactions are forgotten after they\u2019ve been confirmed by miners. The way transactions are confirmed is akin to the practice of an accountant calculating costs and revenue. Rather than miners broadcasting that a transaction took place- and the participants involved, they simply confirm that the sends and receives of peers in the network maintain zero sum. If I announce that I\u2019ve sent 100 Grin, and you announce that you\u2019ve received 100 Grin, the sum of activity is zero (-100 + 100) and thus kosher. That transaction is then forgotten forever. Beyond erasing transactions, privacy is maximized by routing transactions privately across peers before announcing publicly to the network. Nobody can see that I sent you 100 Grin, as it was essentially \u201ctumbled\u201d before it got to you. Instead of addresses, payments are sent as file transfers to HTTP or IP locations. By spoofing IP addresses, users can further promote their privacy. What does this look like? No senders, no recipients, no transactions, no amounts. Grin is arguably the most private cryptocurrency to date. While Grin features some novel innovations, the tokenomics suggest this project may be more for hobbyists and adopters, rather than speculators. The main drawback for traders is the emission schedule for Grin. On average, one Grin is mined every second. This reward will not be reduced or halved at any point in the future. As such, there is an infinite maximum supply. In its first days of mainnet, this also means that the inflation rate is massive. At time of writing, the current rate of inflation is approximately 8% daily. Of course, as the supply increase, the relative inflation will continue to decrease, but until months down the road, the supply will continue to increase at a massive rate. On the other hand, altcoin purists will appreciate that Grin is an open source project with no leader, no pre-mine, and no ICO. Developers may receive donations from the community, but everything takes place on a voluntary basis. This may be seen as a hurdle to overcome for adoption, with no fund to promote adoption in terms of acceptance by different merchants and service providers or listing on exchanges. Because of the implementation of MimbleWimble, Grin acts purely as a currency. There is no scripting language or development protocol that can be used to build contracts and dApps. Whether or not this changes in the future is yet to be seen. It\u2019s also important to recognize that Grin is not the first coin to implement MimbleWimble. Although Grin development began soon after the introduction of MimbleWimble, it\u2019s mainnet was preceded by Beam, whose mainnet launched January 3rd. Beam\u2019s orchestration differs somewhat, it does have a development team and governance model, and it did have a coin sale, but the core sentiments of both: privacy and scalability, remains unchanged.", "date": "2019-01-29T02:24:22+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 29}

After Cryptopia got hacked earlier this week, it now appears Liqui is shutting down as well. Although there is no hack to speak of, the news is not positive in the slightest. Based on the current overall conditions, it appears as if the \u201cgolden days\u201d of cryptocurrency exchanges are over. More specifically, there are numerous companies who either get hacked, have to shut down, or are scrutinized by governments around the world. This is not a positive development for the industry as a whole, although it is only normal custodial platforms face so many problems as well. When taking control of user funds at any given time, there will be some repercussions to contend with. The big news of this week is how the Liqui platform will be shutting down for good. That announcement took a lot of people by surprise. While Liqui has never been a major contender among cryptocurrency exchanges, it has served a fair few people quite well. However, the ongoing market developments and associated bearish pressure have caused a lot of friction companies like Liqui need to contend with these days. The company explains its decision as follows: For users who have an account on this platform, getting their funds out will be the number one priority. Clients will have another four weeks to do, as the website will go into maintenance mode on March 1st. Afterward, it is likely no further withdrawal requests will be honored. As such, they warn users will in advance to take appropriate action and ensure they can get their money out without paying extra fees or never seeing their balances returned to them. Although it appears as if Liqui is shutting down for good, the team is confident they might be back in the future. For now, the current market conditions will not allow them to offer their services. Compared to 2017, overall interest in Bitcoin and altcoins has waned significantly. Whether or not this situation will turn around in the near future, remains to be determined. It seems that is a rather unlikely outcome, unfortunately. It is worth noting that Liqui.io and Liquid.com are two completely different exchanges. The team at Liquid commented: This is not the first major exchange-related news of 2019. About two weeks ago, it became apparent the Cryptopia platform was hacked. Further investigation revealed the criminals still managed to steal funds even when the platform had services suspended and the police were on the case. It seems unlikely Liqui has faced a similar incident, as their decision is mainly economics-based first and foremost. Even so, losing two exchanges in the first month of 2019 paints a bleak outlook for the cryptocurrency industry moving forward.", "date": "2019-01-28T09:46:39+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 28}

Whereas most altcoins, tokens, and digital assets heavily rely on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum first and foremost, it seems some projects continue to do their own thing. As far as the Digibyte price is concerned, it seems the momentum is slowly turning a bit more bullish. The push to $0.01 is in full effect right now, but there is plenty of market resistance along the way. Although many people tend to overlook Digibyte among all other cryptocurrencies right now, it is still a project well worth keeping an eye on at any given time. While it doesn\u2019t necessarily hinge on Bitcoin\u2019s price momentum all that long, it quickly becomes evident the underpinning infrastructure of this altcoin is getting many traders excited. That is part of the reason why this altcoin is pushing toward the $0.01 level once again. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a rather remarkable Digibyte price increase. Following another 3.1% increase in value, one DGB now sits at the price of $0.009715. There is also a 2.1% improvement in BTC value, which is slowly pushing this altcoin to the 270 Satoshi range. Both of these trends are quite positive in their own right, although one has to wonder if it can be sustained. There\u2019s just $371,320 in volume, which won\u2019t necessarily allow for major gains to materialize. On social media, there is no lack of support for Digibyte right now. First of all, there is the tweet by Omoxie, as this user expects big things for Digibyte\u2019s price. More specifically, this person claims a price rise to $1 is not entirely out of the question whatsoever. A very ambitious outlook, although stranger things have happened in the cryptocurrency world over the years. It is also worth noting how DGB continues to make inroads across exchanges worldwide. The most recent platform to enable support for Digibyte comes in the form of 50x, a rather unknown cryptocurrency trading platform. With more gateways being added to obtain DGB, it is evident the global interest in this particular will continue to increase accordingly. How that will affect the price exactly, is a different matter altogether. Last but not least, there is the public message brought to the Twitterverse by Jared Tate. This individual is one of the original Digibyte founders and is quite proud of what his team has achieved throughout 2018. Moreover, he also gives a glimpse into what 2019 will hold exactly. More specifically, the focus now lies on DigitAssets and future dApps for the Digibyte blockchain. Exciting developments, assuming they can be realized in the proposed time frame. All of these signs clearly indicate big things are waiting to happen in the cryptocurrency world. That is, at least where Digibyte is concerned. Even though the trading volume may look weak, the ongoing developments at the protocol and blockchain level should not be ignored by anyone. Reaching $0.01 may still pose a genuine challenge, as the market resistance can\u2019t be overcome all that easily either. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Today will not be one of these days either, primarily because its value has continued to decline for quite some time now. The current Cardano price sits at $0.038, which is quite a long way removed from its all-time high. No immediate improvement is in sight either at this time. Under the current market circumstances, it is not all that surprising to learn Cardano cannot maintain its value in the slightest. In fact, none of the top currencies can do so while Bitcoin is still bleeding value all over the place. This creates a very unfortunate trend which drags all markets with it in very quick succession. Based on the current Bitcoin trend, it seems unlikely anything will change in the near future either. Over the past 24 hours, the Cardano price has lost another near 9% in value. This brings the value down to $0.0377, with a further decline seemingly on the horizon. There is also a 5.6% decline in Bitcoin value, as one ADA is now valued at 1,093 Satoshi. Neither trend will get people excited in the foreseeable future, albeit this also creates a very interesting opportunity to buy in. The big news for Cardano this week is how a new Android wallet has been released. Known as Yoroi, it has been approved this week, with an iOS solution coming to market in the coming days or weeks, pending Apple\u2019s approval. This is another big step forward for this particular cryptocurrency ecosystem. Mobile wallets are in high demand as of right now. For those who are looking for any sort of market trend or indicator, Dutch XrPal has one covered. It is pretty interesting to note how this user thinks him buying any cryptocurrency will lead to a further price decline in the future. Assuming that is indeed the case, his tweet of several days ago makes a lot of sense, in hindsight. Benjp is looking at the current market trend from a slightly different angle. More specifically, he expects ADA to drop further in the coming hours, although there will be a potential 65% gain over the coming months. That in itself is quite interesting to keep an eye on moving forward. Although such a drop would not be impossible whatsoever, one has to wonder how all of this will play out. So far, the overall market sentiment seems to indicate there will be further bearish pressure for Cardano in the foreseeable future. That in itself is not the development users and speculators are looking for, although one can\u2019t expect miracles when all markets rely on Bitcoin first and foremost.

This is primarily due to their perceived anonymity and privacy aspects. Several blockchain analysis companies specialize in ensuring such criminal activity cannot take place. Chainalysis has now confirmed they are launching a similar service for stablecoins. A remarkable development, although one that also makes a fair bit of sense. On the surface, stablecoins should never be of great interest to criminals. They are merely designed to represent digital US Dollars. However, they can be traded against most of the top cryptocurrencies, which does make them somewhat appealing. To combat any nefarious activity involving stablecoins, Chainalysis has launched a new service. It will serve as the Know Your Transaction tool for digitized US Dollars. In launching this service, Chainalysis wants to keep tabs on stablecoins through their entire lifecycle. This tool will also track the creation and issuance of said tokens from now on. It is the first time a blockchain analysis tool is used for stablecoin-related purposes. Only time will tell if there is a genuine need for offerings such as these. It makes sense on paper, as stablecoins can be traded like cryptocurrencies on various trading platforms. Chainalysis COO Jonathan Levin adds: To this day, it still remains somewhat troublesome for cryptocurrency firms to enforce AML controls. This is also part of the reason so few banks want to work together with these companies at this time. Solving that problem needs to happen one step at a time. The help of Chainalysis can prove to be crucial in this regard. Exchanges will be able to monitor high volume transactions and identify potential risks along the way. Although stablecoins are created for the sole purpose of acting as a stable digital currency, they are also pseudonymous like Bitcoin and consorts. As such, this new development is also beneficial to the issues of such digital tokens. It helps these companies strengthen their existing banking relationships and perform the necessarily AML checks. Being transparent with customers is a top priority for companies like Paxos, Tether, et cetera. For the time being, this new solution primarily focuses on ERC-20 stablecoins. This means Tether\u2019s USDT will not be part of this solution, as it is created on the OMNI chain. Chainalysis has confirmed it will introduce support for extra tokens over the next few months. Developments like these pave the way for a more robust ecosystem as a whole. Any positive development is considered to be a big victory. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

Although some individual markets show a lot of promise, the same cannot be said for Stellar. In fact, the Stellar price has suffered very steep declines as of late. It appears this market follow Bitcoin\u2019s lead by example, albeit others blame the developers for allegedly dumping their holdings. Although many people had high hopes for Stellar Lumens in late 2017, it seems the asset never managed to rival Ripple\u2019s XRP, let alone dethrone it in terms of market cap. That is not necessarily a bad thing, as there is still plenty of time to note any real gains in the coming years. For the time being, however, users will need to contend with an intensifying bear market. Over the past 24 hours, there has been another rather steep XLM drop off. The net 4.2% decline in USD value pushes the price below $0.1 once again. Although $0.096955 is still a pretty solid value right now, one has to wonder how long it might take until $0.1 is reached again. There is also the 4% loss in BTC value, driving XLM below 2,700 Satoshi in the process. The big discussion this week is whether or not the Stellar team is effectively dumping their own \u201cpremine\u201d over the past few weeks. It appears a lot of XLM is making its way to exchanges on a regular basis. What is even more worrisome is how this funds is seemingly linked tot he Stellar Development Fund. Although it wouldn\u2019t be abnormal to see them liquidate some XLM to fund development, the increased activity has a fair few people concerned. Putting that discussion aside for a minute, the current XLM chart is pretty interesting to keep an eye on. For now, there appears to be stable support near the 25,000 Satoshi level. If that level would fail to hold over the coming weeks, a massive dump can be expected. So far, there is no reason to panic, as the current value remains well above the support level first and foremost. Although it has become rather common, there are still some good Stellar arbitrage opportunities to take advantage of right now. More specifically, flipping XLM between Binance, Kraken, KuCoin, or Bitexen and moving it to EXMO will yield some spectacular profits. As is always the case, EXMO is not the most liquid exchange on the market today, thus no one will make millions of dollars by exploring these options. Keeping all of this information in mind, it seems there isn\u2019t any real improvement in sight for Stellar as of right now. Until the Bitcoin price picks itself up off the ground again, most of the top markets will continue its downward trend first and foremost. Although XLM has no lack of trading volume, the allegations regarding the Development Fund may cause a lot of added pressure until the matter is resolved.

In the case of Binance Coin, the token is getting a fair bit of attention. So much even that the Binance Coin price is rising quickly while all other top markets remain stuck in the dirt. A very interesting market trend worth keeping an eye on over the weekend. It is always interesting to see how individual markets evolve when the overall momentum is rather one-sided. Unfortunately for tokens, assets, and cryptocurrencies, the overarching momentum has been bearish for some time now. This makes it all the more interesting to keep an eye on Binance Coin, for example. As this token gains more use cases, it appears the overall price continues to rise accordingly. Over the past 24 hours, the Binance Coin price has gained another 3.4% in USD value. There is also a 4% gain in BTC value and a near 5% increase over Ethereum. This brings the value of one BNB to $6.74, or 0.00188 BTC. A more than remarkable market trend under the current circumstances, as it seems Bitcoin still can\u2019t catch a break for more than a few minutes on end. In positive BNB-related news, it would appear the popular token is getting a lot more use cases as of late. So much even that it is almost getting difficult to keep track of them all, by the look of things. Fetch is one of the latest platforms to enable BNB support, which will be of keen interest to securities investors around the world. Getting more ways to spend BNB is always a sign of positive growth. No one can deny the year 2019 has been pretty interesting for Binance Coin in many different ways. Especially where the price is concerned, it would appear the ongoing uptrend is quite spectacular to date. The current gains for the first month of the ear equal nearly 20%, which is a lot more than any other market in the top 20 right now. Even so, there is a chance a correction will kick in sooner or later. When looking at the current BNB chart with a critical outlook, it is evident there is a lot more upward potential on the horizon. Manny D shows there may be a very bullish outbreak fairly soon, assuming this current momentum can be sustained for a bit longer. So far, it seems as if the market is doing exactly that, which is all one can ask for. The most impressive part about Binance Coin is how it continues to note a very high trading volume on a more than regular basis. In that regard, it seems to have at least one leg up over all of its \u201ccompetitors\u201d in terms of market cap. If this growth is sustained, the currency will soon have a $1bn market cap.

His tweets regarding privacy, Bitcoin and altcoin endorsements are all legendary by now. Unlike what some might assume, crypto is not his only focus right now. In a recent video, he confirmed he will run for President of the US in 2020, albeit he will not be on US soil for campaigning purposes until further notice. It\u2019s rumored the IRS has taken a keen interest in McAfee as of late. It\u2019s always interesting to note how some seemingly unimportant political shifts can trigger a lot of backlash. In the United States, citizens are required to pay taxes on their cryptocurrency holdings. John McAfee, a person who made a ton of money with Bitcoin and altcoins over the past few years, has recently confirmed he hasn\u2019t paid any taxes for the past eight years now. It\u2019s only normal this type of behavior will ultimately lead to an investigation by the IRS. Speaking of which, the IRS is \u2013 allegedly \u2013 looking to charge McAfee in the state of Tennessee. Other individuals to be indicted include John\u2019s wife and multiple campaign workers. These campaign workers are all tied to McAfee\u2019s aspirations of running for US President in 2020. An investigation by the IRS is not necessarily something that will help his chances of achieving this goal by any means. His recent \u201cdeparture\u201d from the US only complicates things, as he is now running his campaign \u201cin exile\u201d on his boat. This recent development is another interesting chapter in the storied life of John McAfee. Despite openly challenging the IRS not that long ago and saying \u201chere I am,\u201d McAfee now seems more than willing to take preemptive action against any charges coming his way. Despite leaving US soil on a boat in a hasty manner, McAfee remains defiant and claims he \u201cis not afraid of these people\u201d in the slightest. As far as his current plans are concerned, remaining at large remains his only option. Although it wouldn\u2019t be impossible for McAfee to remain at sea for two years or longer, this action appears to be rather premature. After all, there have been no official charges against him. Unless these charges are officially confirmed, it remains unclear if the IRS is even prepared to take legal action against the McAfee household and associated campaign workers, only time will tell. On another note, a news story broke last year regarding some funds being stolen from the McAfee team. It was believed millions of dollars worth of tokens and currencies were stolen by at least one member. Ever since that time, not much has come of this ongoing investigation. It\u2019s certainly possible this \u201cbounty\u201d has attracted the IRS\u2019 attention. However, as the agency hasn\u2019t confirmed any charges, it remains anyone\u2019s guess as to what will happen next.", "date": "2019-01-23T09:19:46+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 23}

Despite clearly overwhelming bearish pressure across the markets, it seems the Litecoin price is making some interesting moves. Decent-sized gains in USD and BTC value elevate the popular altcoin to a market cap of just under $2bn. Once Bitcoin goes in the green, everything else magically follows. It is more than evident the cryptocurrency markets all rely on Bitcoin\u2019s momentum first and foremost. That situation will not change for the foreseeable future, which has caused a rather lengthy extended bearish trend. Even Litecoin has struggled to note some positive momentum for more than a few hours on end. It is an unfortunate trend, but one that applies to every single market out there right now. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a 2.7% Litecoin price improvement in USD value. This elevates the value per LTC back to $32.84, which is a more than fair value at this time. On the BTC front, it seems the ratio has improved by 1.8%. It is pertinent for altcoins to note gains on Bitcoin to keep the momentum going for a while. Whether or not that can effectively happen, is a different matter. Although no major ecosystem developments have become apparent for Litecoin, there is something interesting going on regardless. A new picture was shared by Alan Austin which shows some of the prominent people in the Litecoin developer community getting together for a dinner. It is evident meetings like these are what keeps Litecoin going right now. When looking at the current Litecoin momentum, the price chart tells a very interesting tale. Considering how this gain was somewhat expected, alert traders could have pocketed an easy 9% profit in just one week. It has been difficult to come by any profits in the industry lately, yet it seems Litecoin has delivered the goods once again. Sustaining the uptrend is a completely different matter altogether. For those who missed the chance to buy Litecoin at a lower value or aren\u2019t willing to chase the top, arbitrage opportunities are always worth looking into. It would appear Litecoin is subject to a fair few price gaps across the different exchanges as of right now. A lot of good money can be made by exploring these price differences in the coming hours. Based on the current market conditions, it seems Litecoin should be valued a fair bit higher than it is right now. Massive trading volume usually results in higher prices, yet the uptrend is somewhat cautious and hesitant right now. That isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, as slow and steady wins most races. However, once Bitcoin goes in the red again, Litecoin may follow suit in quick succession. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

As Dash, Monero, PIVX, and others all compete to offer the best experience, interesting things are bound to happen at some point. As for today, the PIVX price is noting some strong gains across the board. It appears the recent \u201chiring spree\u2019 by the team is getting a lot of attention. Even though it would seem most people care less about privacy coins these days, all of these projects are still worth checking out. PIVX, while a fork of Dash, has seemingly found its own niche crowd in the past year and a half. Although it doesn\u2019t generate any major headlines, the project is still going strong and the community continues to grow on a regular basis. The current price momentum seems to confirm interesting things may be on the horizon for this project in the coming months. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a notable PIVX price change to keep an eye on. Following a 9.1% gain in USD value, one PIVX is now priced at $0.8126. There\u2019s also a 9.8% gain in the PIVX/BTC ratio, pushing the value to 22,728 Satoshi. All of these developments are quite significant in their own regard, although it remains to be seen if the momentum can be sustained in the long run. That has been the main struggle for quite some time now in this industry as a whole. The big PIVX news this week is how the project is officially \u201chiring\u201d people to join their team. The team wants to encourage as many people as possible to join the project in the coming weeks and months. A fair few \u201copenings\u201d are available as of today, although it will be interesting to see what the general response is to this call to arms. Cryptocurrency community engagement is pertinent in this industry and PIVX appears to be checking the right boxes. When looking at the current price momentum from a technical perspective, everything seems to be coming up PIVX. Crypt J sees a healthy risk/reward opportunity for traders who are willing to take a small gamble. Considering how this chart was posted quite some time ago, it would appear the risk was well worth it. The main question is when people will cash out their profits. A very similar chart can be found on Cryptobo34\u2019\\s Twitter feed. This trader also expected a major breakout, although it remains unclear if the expected 34,000 Satoshi target will be reached in the coming hours and days. After all, that would require another near 50% increase over the coming week. It is not impossible to achieve such an uptrend, but there will be plenty of resistance along the way. All things considered, it seems the current PIVX value surge may continue for a few more hours. Unless the overall trading volume picks up, however, it remains unclear if there will be enough support to sustain this current price level. The bearish pressure on cryptocurrency markets has yet to relent and Bitcoin remains on very shaky legs right now. That also affects PIVX in many different ways, yet things will get interesting regardless. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

The most recent 51% attack against this network has seemingly caused a lot of lingering unrest, even though the problems have been addressed for some time now. Thankfully, it would appear the Ethereum Classic price is moving up ever so slightly once again. Continuing this trend over the weekend would send a pretty bullish signal, all things considered. There have always been some interesting trends taking place where Ethereum Classic is concerned. More specifically, this fork of Ethereum seems to go through presumed pump-and-dump cycles on a rather regular basis. Ever since the 51% attack earlier this year, those cycles have been oddly absent from the equation. It is an interesting development, although also another clear sign the crypto bear market is still in full effect as of right now. Over the past 24 hours, there have been some notable, albeit still minor Ethereum Classic price changes. Following a 2.45% gain in USD value and a 1.76% gain over Bitcoin, one ETC is valued at $4.37 once again. It also appears ETC is pushing toward the 0.00122 BTC level, although there is still a way to go until that level can be reached. The coming weekend will prove to be very crucial in this regard, although no one knows which way the momentum will swing exactly. Although there seems to be a lot of attention on Ethereum Classic Vision, it is pertinent to note this fork has nothing to do with Ethereum Classic itself. Instead, it is a fork of Ethereum which will seemingly take some elements from both existing versions of the Ethereum chain. It should never be confused with ETC or ETH, as it is clearly designed to do its own thing. Moreover, there are still some concerns this project is a scam first and foremost. According to the colleagues over at Huobi Research, Ethereum Classic is gaining a bit of traction on the Reddit platform. It is currently the second-most discussed cryptocurrency on that platform, which seems to confirm some excitement is brewing. It remains to be seen if that will affect the price in any shape or form moving forward. After all, community engagement and price changes are not necessarily correlated these days. Last but not least, the lack of any real Ethereum Classic-related excitement makes users create some funny images along the way. Donald McIntyre shared an interesting meme in this regard, as it seems ETC isn\u2019t doing much of anything right now. There is no real market movement, no attacks, nor any internal quarrels. While everything seems to be in order on the surface, it is also quite boring for onlookers at this time. Although the Ethereum Classic value seems to approach the $4.5 level, this will not happen if Bitcoin were to turn bearish once again. With this much uneasy momentum affecting all markets, the weekend will either be spectacular or incredibly boring. Either outcome will spark its own form of social media buzz, although it remains to be seen what the future has in store for Ethereum Classic exactly.

It seems ages since the IOTA price hit its all-time high of $4.5. Unfortunately, it seems that level will not be reached again in the near future. The most recent setbacks push the value even lower, with no recourse in sight. All of this is happening despite some interesting IOTA-related developments becoming apparent. Even though the IOTA ecosystem has tremendous potential, it seems the MIOTA price is not necessarily responding in kind. After the brutal year 2018 turned out to be, this token struggles to note any real gains for more than a few hours on end. The most recent price trend is no different, as IOTA continues to bleed value all over the place. What is even more worrisome is how its overall trading volume has all but dried up in very quick succession. Over the past 24 hours, there has been another 2.7% decline in both USD and BTC value for IOTA. This trend only further confirms overall interest in this token is on the decline. With under $10m in trading volume, sustaining the $824m market cap may prove to be extremely difficult first and foremost. Even though interesting developments are happening behind the scenes, it seems most traders want to seek quick profits elsewhere. The big news for IOTA this week is how the Trinity mobile wallet has received another big update. For a currency focused on the Internet of Things ecosystem, keeping the mobile wallet aspect up-to-date at all times will prove to be crucial. This wallet now includes some significant changes and updates, although further additions will be introduced in future iterations. Secondly, it seems a recent major IOTA token theft has finally lead to an arrest. Roughly 10 million euro worth of IOTA was stolen a little while ago. After Europol launched its investigation shortly after, they have now successfully apprehended at least one suspect in the process. Whether or not any of the funds will be recovered and returned to initial investors, remains unclear. Last but not least, it would appear there will be another Livestream on Twitch to teach the basics about IOTA. Efforts like these are always worthwhile, as they can attract a lot of attention from enthusiasts. Anyone who is remotely interested in experimenting with private IOTA testnets may want to tune in, as it seems an interesting session lies ahead. All in all, developments like these can pave a bright future for this particular project. The main question is whether or not the MIOTA price can not any real gains in the foreseeable future. As is usually the case for other markets, that will primarily hinge on how the Bitcoin value evolves in the coming weeks and months. IOTA, just like all other tokens and altcoins, needs a Bitcoin uptrend prior to going in the green itself. Especially with this weak trading volume, that may prove to be very difficult to achieve.

That is only normal, as most currencies, tokens, and assets try to pursue very different business models first and foremost. As far as the EOS price is concerned, it would appear a minor uptrend has begun taking shape. Some key developments behind the scenes may play a big role in these current proceedings. There is a severe lack of bullish momentum across all cryptocurrency markets right now. This trend is not entirely surprising, as Bitcoin hasn\u2019t shown any intention of rising in value for more than two hours on end. Unless that situation changes in the very near future, none of the other markets will see any different momentum. EOS Will not be an exception in this regard. Keeping that in mind, one has to wonder how long the current EOS price uptrend will remain in place. Although there is a solid 3.5% gain in USD value and a 2.5% gain on Bitcoin, these figures were significantly higher just a few hours ago. This further confirms the current uptrend is still under a lot of pressure, yet that shouldn\u2019t come as too big of a surprise. It will be interesting to see what comes next for this altcoin, Looking beyond the current price trend right now, it seems some positive things are happening behind the scenes for EOS. More specifically, Boscore has enabled its IBC function, which acts similarly to sidechains. As such, value can flow freely between BOS and EOS from this point forward, which is always something to keep an eye on for the future. How this will affect either project in the long run, remains to be determined. Secondly, it appears a new mobile EOS block explorer application has been released recently. Although not everyone will have a use for tools like these, one has to commend the Cypherblock team for trying its hand at bringing this application to market. This is another strong sign of how the EOS ecosystem continues to grow by leaps and bounds, which is what most investors and holders should be concerned about right now. Branden Bulmer is quite impressed with how EOS is growing across the board. New applications, sidechain-esque solutions, a growing user base, and an increase in transaction numbers are all very promising signs first and foremost. At the same time, one has to wonder how long this rate of growth can be sustained. Attracting people who are not involved in cryptocurrency yet remains a key challenge for any projects at this time. Although all of the growth signs are very positive for EOS, its price might not necessarily reflect all of these changes in the near future. After all, there may very well be a trend reversal in the near future, although it remains to be seen what will happen over the coming hours and days. Anything is possible in this particular industry, yet without Bitcoin heading in a decisive direction, it seems unlikely any uptrend can be sustained for very long.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/researchers-explore-viability-of-growing-crops-underneath-solar-panels/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Researchers Explore Viability of Growing Crops Underneath Solar Panels", "content": "A new biotechnological revolution dawns upon society. Harvesting crops may be about so much more than just doing that in the near future. A new study shows it is, in theory, possible to harvest sunshine with regular crops. This will allow farmers to make full use of scarce land and result in additional income. A very interesting approach, albeit the feasibility of this venture has yet to be determined. It is always positive to take note of new developments in the agricultural industry. As harvesting crops becomes more important to keep the world\u2019s population fed, new use cases and solutions will need to be explored. Rather than turning to a lab-based approach, researchers are now trying their hand at something entirely different. Agrovoltaics, as this trend is known as, will combine the best of harvesting crops with clean energy production. To put this in perspective, agrovoltaics can solve two major problems in one go. On the one hand, solutions need to be found to increase the global production of food and produce. That is easier said than done, as there is only so much land available. Furthermore, farmers are dependent on nature\u2019s conditions, which tend to shift every so often. With the world\u2019s population increasing further, the demand for food will only increase exponentially. The second problem comes in the form of finding alternative energy sources. Renewable and clean energy sources are all of the rage as of right now. To address both issues, scientists are experimenting with growing crops underneath photovoltaic panels. In doing so, they hope to not only improve overall food production under dry circumstances, but also to save water. This can very well become the new norm of growing crops in hot regions over the next few years. Another unexpected benefit of this approach is the \u201cnatural cooling effort\u201d crops can have on the solar panels. Ever time the temperature surpasses a certain threshold, solar panels become far less efficient. By growing crops beneath them, the overall temperature is brought down and seemingly remains with the optimal operational range. Although more research is needed to fully test this theory, initial tests have shown pretty appealing results already. While most of these efforts still being isolated events, it is evident there is still a long way to go. It is expected agrovoltaic efforts currently provide roughly two gigawatts of power. As significant as that figure may seem, it is not necessarily making the biggest impact just yet. However, it would appear agrovoltaic efforts are getting a lot more recognition in Asia, Europe, and the US. Further focus on these projects can change the farming industry on a fundamental level. It is efforts like these which show how technological innovation and agriculture can come together in a meaningful manner. Further research is needed to ensure this is a feasible approach. The prospect of saving water, growing more food, and putting a bigger focus on renewable energy seems like a triple win in its own right. It can also provide farmers with additional income, which is always too good to pass up on. A very remarkable breakthrough, assuming it proves to be viable and successful in the long run.", "date": "2019-01-20T18:26:58+00:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 20}

If the Zilliqa price is any indicator, the coming hours will undoubtedly get very interesting. The token notes very solid gains, which is partially due to its main net launching fairly soon. Sustaining this uptrend will still be difficult under the overall market circumstances. It has been a while since people openly discussed Zilliqa. Whereas this would be disastrous for most cryptocurrencies, it doesn\u2019t necessarily matter much where this token is concerned. It would appear the developers are working on finalizing the main net launch, which is slated to occur in a few days from now. As such, it is possible this price spike is merely a pre-launch pump, albeit only time will tell if that is indeed the case. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a notable increase in Zilliqa\u2019s value. There is a 5.3% gain in USD follow, as well as 5% gains in both BTC and ETH value. All of these signs are rather bullish where this token is concerned. One also has to keep in mind the ZIL trading volume seems to be picking up steam in quick succession. If this trend proves to be sustainable, the coming hours and days may prove to be rather interesting. On social media, there is a lot of attention for Zilliqa all of a sudden Not entirely surprising, given this current price trend. I\u2019m Crypto Hero confirms the main net launch in just over a week from today will be a driving factor for this uptrend in the coming days. It also seems Binance will support the token transition when it takes place, which is always a good sign. No one will be surprised to learn some cryptocurrency enthusiasts are turning their back on the \u201cestablished\u201d projects. Adithya Das is confident Ethereum will slip down the market cap rankings in the future, although that may not necessarily happen anytime soon. It is certainly true Zilliqa is getting a lot of attention for its smart contracts, but it doesn\u2019t rival any of the top projects as of yet. When looking at the current price chart, it quickly becomes apparent Zilliqa has been on a somewhat bullish trend for a while now. As higher highs are recorded along the way, it will prove difficult to break the trend. At the same time, all it takes is one day of ultra bearish Bitcoin trading to negate any of these gains in very quick succession. For now, that isn\u2019t materializing, but the threat still looms overhead. Based on the current circumstances, it would not be impossible to see the ZIL price hit $0.025. It currently sits at $0.222, or 619 Satoshi. All it would take is a minor further uptrend to keep this momentum going throughout the rest of the day. In the world of cryptocurrencies, anything can happen when people least expect it. How this will affect Zilliqa throughout the remainder of this week, is anyone\u2019s guess at this point.

The Tron price is going through a very bullish phase right now, although the momentum seems short-lived for the time being. The gains in TRX/BTC are quite impressive, though, as that is exactly what this market needs right now. Few people expected any positive market trend materializing throughout the day. After another dreadful weekend, it would appear the bear market is far from over at this point. This doesn\u2019t bode well for Bitcoin, nor for all of the other markets which primarily derive value from Bitcoin\u2019s momentum. Tron is one of those markets, although the altcoin is noting some strong gains over Bitcoin at this time. Over the past 24 hours, the Tron price has appreciate din a significant manner. Following a 4.5% increase in USD value, one TRX is now priced at $0.025057. There is also a 6.3% increase in TRX/BTC, which brings the value to 700 Satoshi. This latter aspect is the more important one, as most people are invested in altcoins to increase their Bitcoin holdings first and foremost. It would appear this also applies to TRX holders at this time. Following the announced BitTorrent Token distribution announcement, it is now up to individual exchanges and trading volumes to support these airdrops. So far, WazirX in India has already confirmed they will credit token holders\u2019 account balances with BTT when the airdrop occurs. It appears the first of these airdrops will occur in February, which gives users something to look forward to. Another exchange confirming BTT airdrop support is Gate.io. This rather popular altcoin exchange is quite important for Tron trading and arbitrage opportunities alike. As such, having them support this airdrop come February will be a positive development for the Tron ecosystem as a whole. It is expected a lot more exchanges will confirm support for BTT in the coming days and weeks. As is usually the case when cryptocurrency markets start to head in an adverse direction, arbitrage opportunities will come to market. In the case of Tron, the altcoin plays a key role in a rather healthy arbitrage opportunity. Although loop arbitrage opportunities are lucrative, they also hinge on the overall liquidity of the platforms involved. Even so, for those who want to make some good money, exploring this option may be well worth it. All of these signs point toward a rather short-lived Tron uptrend, for the time being. There is always a chance this market will turn mega bullish in the coming hours, although it remains to be seen what happens to Bitcoin first and foremost.

A lot of uneasy momentum remains where Bitcoin is concerned, which usually doesn\u2019t bode too well for the altcoins either. For the VeChain price, the momentum is slowly turning bullish. Despite some rather minor gains across the board, the overall momentum seems rather positive under these circumstances. It is not uncommon for altcoins to buck the overall cryptocurrency market trend these days. Considering how there is a good chance Bitcoin will not recover any of its lost value in the near future. If altcoins do not note strong gains over Bitcoin in the meantime, they will be subjected to even more pressure than usual. As such, it is interesting to see currencies such as VeChain try to inch ahead during this crucial time. Over the past 24 hours, there have been some interesting VeChain price shifts to take note of. First of all, the altcoin gained 3.6% in USD value to bring the price back to $0.004211. In the VET/BTC ratio, a 3.81% increase can be noted. Because of this development, one VET is now valued at 118 Satoshi once again. Both trends seem remarkable positive for this altcoin under the current circumstances. On social media, it would appear there is some excitement regarding a new project currently under development. Although it remains a bit unclear what the project is about exactly, the concept will undoubtedly bring some positive changes to the ecosystem as a whole. Any development will get holders and speculators excited. When looking at the VeChain chart, however, things do not necessarily look all that great right now. The main question is whether or not this VET breakout can be supported for more than a few hours on end. It is evident this will be quite challenging first and foremost, even though the current gains look very promising. A few interesting days lie ahead for this altcoin, by the look of things. Another Vechain chart seems to indicate there may very well be another price drop in the very near future. Although the altcoin recently saw a massive price reversal, the downtrend hasn\u2019t been officially broken as of yet. At the same time, one could argue this is a new accumulation phase prior to noting a very sharp breakout. Only time will tell which option comes true in the end. As is always the case in the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin\u2019s pace dictates the overall market momentum first and foremost. For now, that doesn\u2019t look all that great, primarily because there isn\u2019t much going on where Bitcoin is concerned. How this will affect the value of VeChain in the coming days, is difficult to predict.

So far, the overall momentum is still a bit neutral, although some coins are trying to inch ahead. Tron is noting some small but crucial gains in both USD and BTC value alike. The main question is whether or not the $0.025 level can turn into solid support for the coming days. It is more than evident all cryptocurrency markets rely on Bitcoin\u2019s price momentum first and foremost. Although there is nothing wrong with that on paper, it can cause some issues in the real world. If Bitcoin continues to falter and stumble, none of the alternative markets will note any real changes either. However, today may prove to be different in that regard, at least where Tron is concerned. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a 3.4% increase in Tron\u2019s USD value. This brings the price back to $0.02526, which may very well become the next key support level. In TRX/BTC, there is a 2.29% change in favor of the altcoin. Reaching 700 Satoshi isn\u2019t overly difficult, although there will be some psychological resistance near that level. So far, so good for Tron. On social media, however, not all Tron-related discussions are as positive. Tanuki is clearly not impressed with this altcoin and would rather see it \u201ctank and rest in peace\u201d. There\u2019s nothing wrong with such a very strong sentiment, although it is not necessarily smart to wish for bad things to happen to any project. Cryptocurrency is all about competition and different projects, rather than only seeing one approach succeed. When looking at the current Tron price momentum from a technical point of view, It would appear there may be some short-term market resistance in the future, although that should eventually lead to a further continuation of the current trend. As is always the case, things like these will only come true if nothing major happens to Bitcoin first and foremost. A very interesting outlook, although it remains to be seen if it can come true. As is usually the case where altcoins are concerned, some form of arbitrage opportunities will pop up sooner or later. For Tron, there is a healthy triangular arbitrage opportunity on the market right now, which can make speculators and enthusiasts some good money down the line. It does involve buying with Indian Rupee though, which might make this option slightly less accessible. All of these factors seem to indicate there will be a continuation of the current TRX price trend over the coming hours and days. Although its trading volume is far from impressive right now, it should be sufficient to keep the momentum going for a while. This year may very well prove to be crucial year for Tron, as the expectations surrounding this project are quite high right now. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

All major markets go through a revival of sorts, which is more than welcome after a rocky start to 2019. The Litecoin price has noted a 5% gain in the past few hours, which is a rather impressive trend, all things considered. Many things can be said about Litecoin. It is the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold. There is very little technical innovation. Regardless of how one feels about the project, it remains one of the more valuable alternative currencies on the market. As such, it is only normal there will be intriguing price fluctuations as more time progresses. One such trend is taking place right now, which shows the altcoin is in a good place.

Now is the time for altcoins to gain on Bitcoin, even though the Bitcoin price itself is also moving up nicely. Based on these circumstances, the weekend may prove to be very positive where LTC is concerned There are many interesting developments when it comes to Litecoin. The big news is how Coingate has introduced the Litecoin Lightning Network this week, which further confirms how versatile this project really is. Litecoin is more than capable of holding its own compared to Bitcoin, but the current is also using many of the same technological layers. Another pretty big development to keep in mind comes in the form of OpenBazaar. The project\u2019s developers recently revealed version 2.3 of the platform, which comes with mutli-wallet support. As such, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and ZCash can now be used without too many problems. This is another big development for the project, but one that can also have big repercussions for the Litecoin community itself. When it comes to the technical analysis, anything is possible, by the look of things. It is difficult to make sense of cryptocurrency market movements at the best of times. This sudden outbreak across the board took many people by surprise, for rather obvious reasons. As such, the momentum can also disappear very quickly, which is rather worrisome. Although there is still a lot of positive Litecoin momentum in the market, sustaining any uptrend will remain challenging regardless. One thing working in favor of the altcoin is how there is plenty of trading volume to contend with. More specifically, there is nearly $570m in volume, which is rather huge for a weekend. Whether it can keep the Litecoin party going, is a different matter. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice. The above article is for entertainment and education purposes only.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/ethereum-price-drops-further-following-constantinople-being-postponed/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "Ethereum Price Drops Further Following Constantinople Being Postponed", "content": "It is a very interesting week for all cryptocurrencies, albeit not necessarily for the most obvious reasons. A fresh wave of bearish momentum appears to affect all of the top markets. In the Ethereum price department, minor losses have become apparent in USD and BTC value. This also means the currency will not retake the second spot in the market cap rankings anytime soon. No one will be surprised to learn the cryptocurrency markets aren\u2019t out of the woods yet. Last year was increasingly bearish for all of the markets. It now seems early 2019 will not offer the much-hoped change of pace. Losses can be noted across all particular markets in varying degrees. This puts a lot of pressure on the industry once again, although that is only to be expected at this time. Over the past 24 hours, there has been another drop in Ethereum\u2018s value. With a 2.8% Ethereum price decline, its value now sits at $122. There is also a 1.6% decrease in ETH/BTC, which doesn\u2019t bode well. Now is the time for all currencies to gain ground on Bitcoin itself. Unfortunately, it seems like that will not be happening anytime soon. That may make some Ethereum investors and speculators rather uneasy. There isn\u2019t too much exciting Ethereum news on social media either. With Constantinople being pushed back again, the overall sentiment has become somewhat indifferent. There is some positive news, as Bitfinex enabled another Ethereum-paired trading market. Although it is for a minor token, this further shows overall interest in Ethereum as a base trading market remains in place. When looking at the current price chart, things will get interesting for Ethereum. It seems another drop is very likely to materialize in the coming days, although that will eventually lead to an uptrend. At least, that is what Yim is hoping for right now. Whether or not that will be the case, is a different matter altogether. There isn\u2019t anything to warrant an ETH uptrend right now. As is usually the case in the cryptocurrency world, there are arbitrage opportunities to take advantage of. In the case of Ethereum, there is some good money to be made right now. While this usually involves dealing with the EXMO exchange, it is still pretty interesting to explore these options. Cryptocurrency is all about making money first and foremost. Keeping all of the current market circumstances in mind, it remains to be seen what will happen to Ethereum later this week. The delay of Constantinople will set the market back quite a bit, primarily because it was the main \u201cselling point\u201d of ETH for Q1 2019. Those with a short-term mindset will potentially turn their back on Ethereum, whereas everyone else will patiently wait to see what comes next. Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

{"url": "https://themerkle.com/the-crypto-winter-is-far-from-over-chainfront-ceo-warns/", "author": "JP Buntinx", "title": "The Crypto Winter is Far From Over, ChainFront CEO Warns", "content": "It is still unclear what the short-term and long-term future will hold for Bitcoin and all other markets. The overall sentiment looks as bearish as it was throughout 2018. A repeat of the year 2017 might not necessarily happen soon, although that is only to be expected. Al Warms is confident the \u201ccrypto winter\u2019 will remain in place for quite some time to come. Whereas a lot of people had high expectations for early 2019 in terms of crypto market momentum, the reality is very different. While there was no reason to expect nay major positive changes, it is still odd to see this bearish momentum continue. That is not how most users had expected things to move ahead, yet there is very little one can do about this current trend. In fact, it seems there may not be any improvements on the horizon for the foreseeable future either. According to ChainFront CEO Al Warms, the current market momentum was to be expected. It has to be said how the year 2017 was exceptional in many different ways, although it ended up hurting the credibility of most cryptocurrencies and digital assets in the process. That is not how enthusiasts and experts hoped for the situation to pan out, but there isn\u2019t much that can be done about it in hindsight. When looking at the current market situation, Warms is convinced the \u201cexuberance of 2017\u201d caused these conditions in early 2019. Now that the ICO business model is no longer as appealing as it once was and cryptocurrencies bleeding value all over the place, it would appear the uneasy momentum might remain in place for some time to come. Warms wouldn\u2019t go as far as calling the market a \u201cbubble\u201d by any means, although it is not hard to see where the sentiment would come from. However, he does add: It is especially this latter part which has been a key issue in the industry. Mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies has not increased much throughout 2017 and 23018. Although more people invested in Bitcoin and altcoins, it is plausible to assume most of them cut their losses and have moved on until the situation improves. As that improvement remains elusive for now, it remains to be seen if those users will come back in the near future. All of this seems to indicate the bearish cryptocurrency market trend will remain in place for some time to come. There is nothing that warrants a bit uptrend right now, and it seems overall interest in these markets lacks any real growth as well. The crypto winter can last a very long time, for all anyone knows. That is not necessarily something that makes traders and speculators happy, but keeping one\u2019s expectations in check is the only realistic approach right now.
