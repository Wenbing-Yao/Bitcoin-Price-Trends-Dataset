Michael Scott | May 01, 2019 | 09:00 Share Tweet Send Share Taxation frustrates many in the cryptocurrency community. Investor capital gains along with Coinbase\u2019s well-documented jockeying with the IRS, taxes continue to be an ongoing concern.There is some good news however on the U.S. tax front with respect to these cryptocurrency valuations gains.Embedded in the highly debated $1.5 trillion dollar tax cut signed by President Trump into the law in late 2017 is an esoteric section addressing the tax treatment of real estate and other tax assets. Known as the Investing in Opportunity Act and Opportunity Zone Investment program, it offers savvy investors the opportunity to defer and eliminate future capital gains through Qualified Opportunity Zones and Qualified Opportunity Funds.So what are Opportunity Zones? In short, they are land parcels in low-income, geographic census tracts that have been designated for investment opportunities and favorable capital gains treatment.The Qualified Opportunity Funds provide an investment vehicle for these zones. To obtain the maximum tax benefit, investors must hold monies in an Opportunity Zone Fund or property for 10 yearsThe Cryptotization of Opportunity ZonesLongtime bitcoin advocate Charlie Shrem recently opined on Twitter about the possibilities tied to Bitcoin and Qualified Opportunity Zones. San Francisco blockchain innovator Jomari Peterson is a strong advocate of this notion. He, in fact, is birthing a new project known as Gama Ventures, a blockchain centric Qualified Opportunity Zone fund seeking to invest in the growth and development of distressed communities.The goal? To facilitate revenue sharing and micro-equity investments opportunities fueling commercial development, housing, health/wellness initiatives, and free localized WiFi for targeted, economically distressed areas. Asked about the potential benefits to investors, Peterson rattled them off in rapid-fire succession.Defer capital gainsReduce capital gainsEliminate capital gains in future gainsAttracting Cryptocurrency Holders and InvestorsHe believes that these Opportunity Zone investment opportunities hold particular appeal for high net-worth crypto holders who remain under the edicts of U.S. tax law.Says Peterson:The repatriation of crypto funds from overseas offers a unique investment strategy for those looking to mitigate their tax liability while developing and maintain their long term wealth. They can make a meaningful impact by putting their money to work in a productive way in communities of need.Through the use of blockchain, Gama Ventures is erecting an ecosystem of smart contracts and automated systems to foster transparency, access, and flexibility for its stakeholders. The goal, says Peterson,is to coalesce a community of partners around an operational model that fosters multi-stakeholder participation in opportunity fund management.Policymakers, too, are hopeful that these zones will create a much-needed flow of investment monies toward low-income communities throughout the nation, including in the unincorporated U.S. territory of Puerto Rico where large swaths of opportunity zones currently exist.Peterson says that his extensive work in aligning economic development and cryptocurrency for the benefit of marginalized communities and populations gives him an uncommon lens for extolling the benefits of Qualified Opportunity Zones.I am a huge advocate of operating within the regulatory framework, particularly when it involves not only tax advantages to crypto investors, but significant benefits to low-income communities here in the U.S. I see this as a unique win-win scenario.The content published on Bitcoinist is intended for educational purposes only and should not be taken as investment advice.

Beginning in December 2017, Bitcoin price hit its subsequent low of $3130 in December last year, while 2019 has set a highly optimistic tone. As Bitcoinist reported, prior to last week\u2019s slump, some of the community\u2019s best-known figures had publicly stated they were up to 95 percent certain that BTC/USD would not fall below $3000 again.This week, they were joined by fellow Bitcoin bull Tom Lee, who judged the market\u2019s reaction to Bitfinex as potential proof of its newfound bullish resilience.\u201cIf this tether\u2026 story broke in mid- to late-2018, the crypto market would probably (have) seen panic liquidations across the board,\u201d he wrote on Twitter Tuesday. \u201cAnother sign crypto winter is ending?\u2026 I think so[.]\u201dLee was continuing a mood he set in a research piece for his market strategy firm Fundstrat Global Advisors last week, in which analysts highlighted eleven signs which tend to occur only in a bull market.

Specifically, starting with the digitization of a single test project, culminating in the deployment of blockchain for voting procedures. From small projects to big ones.Fyodorov succeeded in galvanizing over 600 thousand online volunteers as part of Zelenskiy\u2019s digital campaign, the young leader appealing to inhabitants of a country where digital phenomena such as cryptocurrency are already a major talking point. As Bitcoinist reported, only this month, authorities in the capital Kiev returned to the idea of accepting direct Bitcoin payments, this time for public transport. Blockchain Not BribesWhile he did not mention Bitcoin specifically, Fyodorov\u2019s perspective on disruptive technology is highly reminiscent of pledges by US 2020 Presidential hopeful Andrew Yang. A similarly energetic figure, Yang has already released a dedicated policy statement on cryptocurrency, promising to overhaul the US\u2019 \u201cpatchwork\u201d regulatory landscape and making ownership and use less burdensome on individuals and businesses. An open policy on the technology would hold clear benefits in Ukraine. As the semi-frozen conflict with Russia rumbles on, Bitcoin has become a symbol of resistance across the border, compounded by a lack of ability by the Kremlin to install suitable regulation.A Bitcoin wallet belonging to the campaign of major Putin rival Alexey Navalny has collected almost 600 BTC ($3.25 million) since 2016. For Fyodorov, using technology such as Blockchain to remove the opacity of state organs likewise runs in contrast to the murky world of Moscow. For example, his scheme to let citizens open and close businesses \u201cin two clicks\u201d as part of the digital state, begun as a private project, stands in direct opposition to scandals such as last week\u2019s state-sponsored $1 million Bitcoin bribe.\u201c\u2026People who work in business witnessed the changes and believed in them,\u201d he said.Ukraine is already home to various crypto industry adoption pushes, including from the previous government administration, which in October pledged to develop full legalization frameworks for cryptocurrency by 2021.What do you think about Ukraine\u2019s perspectives regarding Bitcoin and Blockchain?

The attackers were also able to reverse an initial patch by the company by redirecting users to compromised machines that contained the malware.Known as being a \u201clightweight\u201d wallet, Electrum was chosen for attack due to its simplified architecture, operating in a client/server configuration. It was this configuration that would eventually allow attackers to compromise the network\u2019s security.Specifically, attackers took advantage of the fact that anyone could operate on the network as a public Electrum peer. Attackers then launched what\u2019s called a Sybil attack that introduces compromised nodes into the network.

They\u2019re selling more ads, just less more than before.Revenue from advertisements grew by 15% in the first quarter of the year, their slowest growth in a while.Earnings per share, revenue, and many other key metrics fell short of analyst expectations and GOOG shares are expected to drop about 7% at the opening bell.No pressure Apple.The Bitfinex PremiumCrypto markets are still on alert following last week\u2019s Tether debacle.What I\u2019m watching at the moment is the bitfinex premium that\u2019s opened up and still persists this morning. At the time of this writing, the price of Bitcoin is about $325 higher on bitfinex than it is in the rest of the market.This gap is a clear example of what I\u2019ve been saying about Tether for months. Any sort of erosion in confidence in USDT is more likely to push the price of Bitcoin up, rather than down. As investors sell the stable coin they\u2019re more likely to buy other cryptos.Still, the price of Tether remains remarkably stable. What\u2019s even more incredible is that it seems like this entire story has actually made other stablecoins more stable as well.Here we can see the four largest stable coins by market cap.We can see the clear market reaction on April 26th, which was that they all fell except for Paxos (yellow). Since then Tether has been trading at around 99 cents but at the time of this writing, they\u2019re all precisely $1, except Paxos, which is $1.015.One trader, talking to the Wall Street Journal put it best when he said: \u201cthe market just doesn\u2019t care.\u201dFunny enough, one thing the market might care about are Musk Tweets. The tech mogul Elon Musk put out a single word tweet last night, which led to an entire conversation about crypto adoption.Now, we can\u2019t say definitively that it was Elon\u2019s tweet that moved the market, but we can see that the price of Ether rose sharply as the community quickly RTed and commented.The time of the tweet is in the purple circle.As always, many thanks for reading and to all of you sending in your excellent questions, comments, and feedback.

The WikiLeaks defense fund has already received roughly $20,000 dollars in bitcoin donation in just 24 hours.Julian Assange Sees Donations FlowingJulian Assange, who had been living at the Ecuadorian embassy in London for seven years, was arrested Thursday morning after the country\u2019s president rescinded the WikiLeaks founder\u2019s asylum status. Assange\u2019s eviction has caused an uproar across the globe.

It currently accepts Bitcoin, ZCash, as well as traditional payment methods including bank cards, and even cash or cheque.As Bitcoinist reported yesterday, the wallet address for BTC donations jumped to a balance of 2.61 BTC ($13,200 USD) with around 20 transactions occurring moments after Assange\u2019s arrest. Over the past 24 hours, nearly 140 more donations were received. The total at press time is approximately 7.94 BTC or over $31,000 dollars and counting. Bitcoin as \u2018Free Speech Money\u2019Julian Assange had previously shown his support for Bitcoin despite some previous opposition from the industry itself. In Apil 2018 US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase suspended WikiLeaks\u2019 use of its services to much backlash. In turn, WikiLeaks accused the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange of ulterior political motives and obeying a \u201cconcealed influence.\u201d It also called for a boycott of Coinbase, while continuing to accept Bitcoin donations directly. WikiLeaks initially began accepting bitcoin after many credit institutions, banks, and payment services like PayPal and Visa withdrew support in 2010.Since then, several other companies such as social network Gab have followed WikiLeaks\u2019 example. Dubbing it \u201cfree speech money,\u201d the platform began accepting bitcoin as a way to transfer value without political interference.Over $22 Million Donations in BTC and CountingBitcoin has indeed proven to be a boon for WikiLeaks and Julian Assange.

The research chief and managing partner at Fundstrat also says that the old Bitcoin whales are back and have begun to buy back massively due to a shift towards positive market sentiments.The Old Whales Have ReturnedSpeaking to CNBC on Thursday (April 4, 2019), Lee commented on the recent price surged experienced by the top-ranked cryptocurrency, saying:Bitcoin had a rough 2018 and for much of 2019, it has been steadily climbing and from what we can gather, it is because there are a lot of positive things taking place. A lot of the old whale wallets are buying Bitcoin.According to Lee, many of these old whales liquidated their BTC holdings back when bitcoin price almost topped $20,000 in mid-December 2017. It would seem like there is a shift in market sentiment towards the positive end of the spectrum.Earlier in the year, Lee published Fundstrat\u2019s outlook for 2019 which included a trend reversal for the market as a whole. Lee believes that developments like Bakkt and Fidelity\u2019s custody solutions will act as tailwinds pushing BTC price even higher in 2019.Also, Lee pointed towards the growing utility of Bitcoin in places of economic unrest around the world. In places like Venezuela and Iran, people are continually turning towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.As previously reported by Bitcoinist, the U.S. government is reportedly looking to ban Visa and Mastercard from facilitating payments in Venezuela. Such moves only serve to push more people towards adopting Bitcoin. Bitcoin Fair Value is $14,000On the subject of BTC\u2019s price, Lee returned his previous assertion that the top-ranked cryptocurrency is still trading below its real value. According to the Fundstrat managing partner, Bitcoin\u2019s fair value is somewhere around $14,000.Going by Lee\u2019s assertion, BTC is currently trading at less than 40 percent of its fair market value. For Lee, an accurate valuation for Bitcoin takes into active addresses and activity per user which points to BTC being worth around $14,000.The Fundstrat research head also based his valuation on the fact that a commodity should trade at 2.5x its breakeven value during a bull market. However, this assumes a breakeven BTC mining cost of between $5,000 to $6,000.How High Will Bitcoin Go?Since the April 2, 2019 surge, much of the talk has been centered on where BTC will end up at the end of the rally. Despite a Thursday\u2019s price pullback, BTC price is hovering around the $5,000 price level, which is serving as support.Brian Kelly of BKCM forecasts that BTC could go as high as the $6,000 to $6,500 price range. For many commentators, the question is what the new psychological resistance price would be now that bitcoin has broken $4,200.Do you agree with Lee\u2019s assertion that Bitcoin\u2019s fair value is around $14,000?

If you\u2019ve spent the past week in a crypto-proof booth, here\u2019s the Sunday Digest; a collection of the salient, spellbinding, or just strange news from the past seven days.Bitcoin Price Breaks Through $5000It seems like only a week ago that I was writing about bitcoin price 00 breaking through $4000. Because it was only a week ago that I was writing about bitcoin price breaking through $4000.After closing last week (and month) at a bullish $4100, bitcoin continued to charge through the past seven days. The $5000 mark quickly fell, leading to an abundance of increasingly implausible suggestions to explain the phenomenon.When $5000 held (and continued to hold), the bullish sentiment started to awaken. Tom Lee suggested a fair value of $14,000 for BTC, and Peter Brandt called the potential start of a new parabolic move.Crypto News TidbitsYou might be forgiven for thinking the only news that mattered this week was BTC price\u2026 but you\u2019d be wrong. The week started with the shocking news that LA rapper and cryptocurrency advocate, Nipsey Hustle had been shot dead.We then found out that US Congress introduced two new crypo-related bills (not the $5 and $10 USDTether), and Kiev was reportedly considering accepting bitcoin on public transport. And April Fools day wasn\u2019t even over yet.Certainly, no joke was analyst plan\u20bf\u200f\u2019s suggestion that Quantitive Easing will \u2018print\u2019 Bitcoin\u2019s market cap up to $100 trillion. Nor was research suggesting that Bitcoin will be the world\u2019s main payment system in 10 years time.The week\u2019s BTC price rally spurred a 950% volume increase on CME futures contracts, and Trump picked an alleged arse-grabbing no-coiner, Herman Cain, for the Fed. So I guess he\u2019ll fit right in.Mind you, all of these developments in bitcoin are happening as global debt reaches $3.3 trillion.Elon Musk \u2018Quits\u2019 as Dogecoin CEOAfter being voted in by the community, Elon Musk immediately quit as the \u2018CEO\u2019 of Dogecoin this week. They\u2019d seemed like such a cute couple; but Dogecoin wasn\u2019t bitter, having pumped 35% in the course of one day.And because it seems everyone likes an Elon/Tesla story, we compared Tesla stock performance against Bitcoin in 2019.

Welcome to earnings season. Investors got a good taste on Friday as JP Morgan and Wells Fargo managed to surpass investor expectations. Today, we continue to watch the financial sector as Citi Bank, Goldman Sachs, and M&T Bank report before the opening bell.You can check the times and forecasts for all the upcoming earnings announcements at this link: https://www.etoro.com/investing/earnings-reports/@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsChinese FakeoutTrump Vs FedBlockchain in ParisPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of April 15th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsAt one point Chinese stocks were up by 3% today, but it seems that by now the gains have been almost completely erased.Two reasons have been named for the sharp increase. The first is a delayed reaction to some positive trade balance figures on Friday. As the numbers were published in what is technically the weekend in China, it would make sense for the reaction to come this morning. Also, the numbers were really good.The final figure was published at 221 billion CNH, as economists were forecasting just 2 billion CNH.The second reason is\u2026.There doesn\u2019t seem to be any immediate reason for the gains to have been erased. Funny that.Trump Against the FedOver the weekend, the US President continued his attack against the US Federal Reserve with a tweet that was more than slightly shocking\u2026What\u2019s unclear to me, aside from what calculation was used to arrive at these numbers, is what exactly the President hopes to gain from this offensive.It would seem that he\u2019s trying to get the Fed to step on the gas a bit more, but as we discussed in Friday\u2019s update, the pedal is already at the floor. Some have suggested that Trump is simply trying to blame the Fed for lackluster economic performance, but if that\u2019s the case, this is even more perplexing as the economy has been doing fantastic.Blockchain in ParisPrice action has been encouraging over the weekend and all of the top cap cryptos are up over the last 24 hours.One thing we\u2019ll be watching closely is Paris Blockchain Week, which has just been kicked off with a bang by Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s minister of economics and finance.Monsieur Le Maire is tweet-storming as I write, this last one looks really encouraging\u2026Tomorrow, eToro takes the stage along with eToroX.

The rating agency says this trend points to the increasing level of cryptocurrency adoption for many users across the globe.Cryptocurrency Sees Transactions Soar in 2018According to a blog post published by the agency on Wednesday (April 10, 2019), four altcoin projects saw massive growth in user adoption throughout 2018. Meanwhile, at the time, market prices were plummeting by an average of 80 percent across the board.EOS transaction volume grew from 7,000 per day to about 4.6 million per day between February 2018 and March 2019. Tron, also saw its own count increase from 3,000 to 1.9 million during the same period.The other two cryptocurrency projects identified by Weiss Ratings \u2013 BitShares and WAX, saw their numbers grow to 1.1 million and 4.4 million transactions per day, respectively.In total, these four altcoin projects experienced a 2,700 percent increase in daily transaction count, growing from 433,000 transactions in February 2018 to more than 12.4 million as at March 2019.According to Weiss Ratings, this increased adoption in the face of bear market conditions parallels the trend observed during the dot-com era. The agency expects that developments in the technology will lead to a greater cryptocurrency adoption in the near future.Not All Transactions Are EqualHowever, it is important to note that high transaction count doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to meaningful value transfer. Moreover, transacting on the aforementioned top-four blockchains, in particular, costs very little. Therefore, it may be a poor metric to gauge mass adoption as most of this activity may not actually be economic in nature and/or performed by real users.EOS\u2019s daily transaction count, for example, outstrips Bitcoin by as much as 14 times. However, Bitcoin value transferred dwarfs every other existing blockchain.Earlier this week, cryptocurrency analyst Ceteris Paribus highlighted that Bitcoin processes 20 times more USD transactions than EOS despite having only about seven percent of the latter\u2019s transaction count.Additionally, Bitcoin\u2019s metrics do not include second-layer transactions via the Lightning Network.Transaction counts get a lot of hype, but what kind of value is actually being moved on chain?For example:Bitcoin processes <7% the amount of daily transactions as EOS yet moves 20x the USD. pic.twitter.com/dgGHgE4rKQ\u2014 Ceteris Paribus (@ceterispar1bus) April 10, 2019Weiss Ratings does acknowledge this fact, saying:Of course, not all transactions are qualitatively the same. A $10 million Bitcoin transfer is obviously more important than a simple vote or \u2018like\u2019 on Steem.According to Weiss Ratings, other essential metrics like security, network capacity, and developer activity have also increased over the last 12 months. Coupled with the lower prices, the agency believes that altcoins are on their way to gaining greater traction in the finance and technology industries.As reported by Bitcoinist, an online Twitter poll by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revealed that many people Bitcoin and other cryptos will become mainstream within the next five years.What are your earliest forecast for Bitcoin and other cryptos becoming mainstream?

Altcoins are typically described as any other crypto asset which isn\u2019t Bitcoin. Hence, the period during which altcoins perform well is usually referred to as an altcoin season or \u201caltseason.\u201d There are a few factors which can be monitored to determine whether we\u2019ve entered an altseason \u2014 and, as of now, it does seem like it has happened.The first thing to look at is the Bitcoin Dominance index. This is a metric which monitors the relative share of Bitcoin\u2019s market cap to that of the entire industry. At the time of this writing, BTC dominance stands at 51.2 percent, according to data from CoinMarketCap. It\u2019s important to note that this marks its lowest point since August 2018, which indicates that altcoins are performing increasingly well.One of the main characteristics of an altcoin season is that certain cryptocurrencies will spike up in value massively over short periods of time. We observed this back in late 2017 and early 2018 when gains upwards of 500 percent overnight weren\u2019t something unusual.And while the prominence of the current period is nowhere near that level, we can still see certain altcoins mark notable gains in relatively short periods of time. For example, a few days ago, a cryptocurrency called Everex (EVX) spiked with 300 percent over the course of two short days.Picking the Right Altcoin for This SeasonPicking the cryptocurrency which will explode in value is never an easy task. However, looking at the Top-10 chart on CoinMarketCap, we can definitely identify some of the stronger performers to keep an eye out for.Litecoin (LTC), for example, has been performing splendidly throughout the past three months. At the time of this writing, the cryptocurrency is trading around $80, which is about 150 percent more compared to its price at the beginning of the year. Moreover, LTC has marked an increase of more than 20 percent in the last 24 hours \u2014 which is also a prominent sign.Another altcoin which doubled up in value for the same period is Tezos (XTZ). It\u2019s currently trading at around $1, which marks an increase upwards of 100 percent in the last three months.Of course, there is a huge amount of altcoins out there and spotting those that will perform the best is nearly impossible. Coins and tokens with large market capitalization are usually less risky investments due to a good deal of stability and trading volume, which are basic requirements for many traders.Your Trading Platform Also MattersIt\u2019s also very important to be careful when you pick up the platform where you\u2019ll be trading these altcoins.It\u2019s not necessary for the cryptocurrencies to mark unimaginable gains for you to make a lot of money. Evolve.Markets, for example, supports leveraged trading of up to 50:1 on its altcoin pairs \u2014 which can be used to substantially increase profitability, capitalizing on the current altcoin season.Both Litecoin (LTC) and Tezos (XTZ) are supported by the platform, as well as other altcoins such as Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), Zcash (ZEC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Monero (XMR), and others.However, it\u2019s also worth noting that margin trading not only has the potential to magnify your profits but also magnify your losses on the losing trades.Additionally, if you don\u2019t feel like trading cryptocurrencies, Evolve.Markets also gives you access to leveraged trading on FOREX, commodities, and indices.The Bottom LineThe presence of an altcoin season provides traders with an opportunity to make quick gains, capitalizing on the increased price volatility. Of course, increased volatility also means that things can go south incredibly quickly. Hence, it\u2019s important to be extra careful and cautious throughout periods of the kind.Which altcoin will perform best in the current altcoin season?

According to some, this is a sign of institutional net buying and that new money is coming into the market. GBTC Soars 47% Since Pre-5K BreakoutGBTC, a product offered by Grayscale Investments, the world\u2019s largest digital asset fund, is having a great year so far, gaining more than 56 percent in the past three months.More notably, the product is up 47 percent since Bitcoin\u2019s latest rally on April 2nd, while Bitcoin\u2019s spot price 00 has increased by only 28 percent.According to economist and popular trader Alex Kr\u00fcger\u200f, this is a sign of new money coming into the market. He explained:GBTC 10% today, outperforming BTC. \u2013 GBTC +47% since [April 2nd] breakout \u2013 BTC +28% since [April 2nd] breakout Another symptom of new money coming into crypto.Earlier this week, Bitcoinist reported that institutional Bitcoin trading volume has grown for four consecutive months. However, GBTC has lost some market share dropping to under 24 percent compared to over 50 percent when it comes to institutional products.However, the latest rally of Bitcoin\u2019s price did cause the assets under management (AUM) of Grayscale Investments to surge past $1 billion. Shortly after that, the asset manager increased the overall share of Bitcoin as part of its composition by 1.5 percent.Why Is The GBTC Premium Rising?The price of one GBTC share is set at 0.00098409 BTC. At the time of this writing, this equals $5. Given the current price of Bitcoin 00, this means that GBTC buyers are happily paying a premium worth around 37 percent. Moreover, there\u2019s also an additional 2 percent annual fee on top of the premium.Back in February, when the premium was almost identical, the head analyst of Fundstrat Global Advisors, Tom Lee, commented on the matter, explaining that the rise in premium is a sign of institutional net buying.CRYPTO: $GBTC premium to NAV creeping up to 36% on heels of $BTC surge to ~$4,000Rise in premium is a sign of institutional net buying (easier to buy this ETN from \u2066@GrayscaleInvest\u2069 than buy via a crypto exchange)\u2026\u2026another sign 2019 way better than 2018 for crypto pic.twitter.com/hdFh8y3sY9\u2014 Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) February 19, 2019Why Pay a Premium on Bitcoin?Shares of GBTC are touted to be the first \u201cpublicly quoted securities solely invested in and deriving value from the price of bitcoin.\u201dGBTC allows institutional investors to receive exposure to the price movement of bitcoin by using a traditional investment vehicle. In other words, investors don\u2019t have to worry about buying, storing, and managing their private keys.Moreover, GBTC shares are also eligible to be held in certain IRA, as well as other brokerage accounts. Hence why investors are paying that high premium compared to Bitcoin\u2019s spot price.It appears that the latest price surge may have shifted the market sentiment.

But one might want to take the repeating \u201cDon\u2019t buy bitcoin\u201d message from the mainstream press with a grain of salt. Kids, Don\u2019t Buy BitcoinAs bitcoin price 00 appears to be attempting to shake off the bear market, headlines from the media are starting to resemble those in late 2017. Yes, right before BTC price soared to its record heights of nearly $20,000 USD.\u201cDon\u2019t buy bitcoin, warns wealth manager\u201d reads an April 4th headline from CNBC. The problem, though, is that it\u2019s almost verbatim from November 13, 2017, when CNBC said that \u201cAs bitcoin soars and ICOs spread, advisors urge caution.\u201d The price, of course, doubled a month later.In fact, 2017 was particularly fruitful when it came to telling the public that: Bitcoin Bad!German central bank\u2019s board member Carl-Ludwig Thiele, for example, warned against investing in the cryptocurrency in May 2017. Pretty much every bank in the world has cautioned against Bitcoin at some point or other. And most of these indeed received their spotlight in the papers.Had you read the Economic Times in October 2017, for example, when bitcoin was roughly $4,000, you would have learned the \u201c7 Reasons not to invest in bitcoin, cryptocurrencies.\u201d Of course, the 500 percent gain in price thereafter would have eluded you.But maybe you would have given up and panic bought at $19,000. Well, that would have been your fault then. It was a bubble after all. Didn\u2019t you read the papers?DYORThe truth is that the mainstream press doesn\u2019t care if you make or lose money. Neither does anyone else for that matter. It\u2019s all about clicks and ad revenue.And what\u2019s better than alternating between fear and greed to get clicks? Why not both? Even better!Bet on the price of bitcoin with cash on this regulated platform whose parent company advertises in the same newspaper that says it\u2019s better to just bet on bitcoin price.Forbes explained the \u201c6 reasons why Bitcoin futures are better than bitcoin\u201d in December 2017. Three days later though, they also told you to \u201ccompletely ignore\u201d the 1,400 percent bitcoin price rally.*Sigh*The point here is simply this: it\u2019s all noise.You will learn very little about Bitcoin itself reading the mainstream newspapers. Most headlines are algorithm-based and might as well be written by robots.But merely pointing to the bitcoin price (because it\u2019s trending) to evoke fear and/or greed and say \u201cLook!\u201d works. And that\u2019s why the press keeps doing it.Distinguishing the signal from the noise, however, is much harder than simply glancing over some headlines and feeling like you learned something.It\u2019s only possible if one does their research (DYOR). It requires time. But it\u2019s the only way to ensure you\u2019re making more educated decisions than reading clickbait. More importantly, the decisions will be yours. It also beats FOMO\u2019ing into the latest virtual coin or living in ignorance and then with regret.Bitcoin Isn\u2019t Money. This Piece of Paper Is.Unfortunately, the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) have been rehashed, repeated and reverberated for the past decade since Bitcoin first launched. In the press, Bitcoin was a bubble in 2011. It was a bubble in 2017. And it\u2019s still a bubble now.But if it\u2019s always about to pop, if it\u2019s just fad, and \u2018not money\u2019 \u2013 why devote so much time and effort to discredit it?Interestingly, some of the most notable publications are directly named after (fiat) billionaires. It may also be no coincidence that academia, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet \u2014 entities who greatly benefit from the status quo and have a tremendous influence on public opinion \u2014 are also very anti-Bitcoin.Amusingly, most people who held bitcoin before 2017 have outperformed the \u2018Oracle of Omaha\u2019 even after the crash.Bitcoin has even beaten stocks like Amazon (AMZN) in the past seven years. But you won\u2019t know this reading the Washington Post, which is owned by the same guy by the way.Is it really a surprise that legacy financial institutions, Wall Street, banks, etc. are throwing so much shade at Bitcoin?Probably not. Which is why it might be worth learning what Bitcoin is, why it was created and what could happen if the $243 trillion USD worth of global debt is foreshadowing another financial crisis.It may then become clear why the CME chairman, for example, is so anti-bitcoin. Maybe you\u2019ll even end up getting some\u2026you know, just in case the bubble re-inflates.Do you trust the mainstream media\u2019s reporting on Bitcoin?

As investors, we play a very unique role in the global ecosystem. Companies with more money have more power collectively, as investors we have considerable influence. In many cases, investing in a company with a noble social or environmental cause can even yield greater profits than their incumbent competitors.The term impact investing embodies this concept and the search term has been rising steadily over the last decade.Of course, researching which companies to invest in and building a portfolio on this basis can be extremely time-consuming. So, in order to give our clients an advantage, the eToro team has put together a new CopyPortfolio for @RenewableEnergy.The 22 stocks were specifically selected based on the companies respective goals to reduce our carbon footprint, their geographic diversity, and already significant market cap. Feel free to review the full prospectus at this link, or invest in just a few clicks on the eToro platform.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsGetting Closer SlowerTurkey CollapsingAlt Season ContinuesPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of March 28th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsThough the risks are mostly isolated to the UK and partially Europe, all global investors should probably have one eye on the Brexit at the moment. As we progress, it does seem that any doomsday scenario is getting increasingly less likely, but certainly worth watching out for.A series of eight votes were held in Parliament yesterday to try and determine what should be done. None of them passed, but two of them did get further than May\u2019s deal, which included the option to stay in the EU customs union, and the very popular option of a second referendum. Overall, it seemed that softer options were more pleasing to UK lawmakers, making a hard Brexit seem less likely.Additionally, Prime Minister May has given a rather peculiar ultimatum that she will resign if her deal passes. Some were quick to point out the irony that if she wins she has to go, but if she losses she can stay in power. Of course, it\u2019s entirely possible that she\u2019ll never get that option anyway, as Parliament is reluctant to vote on the same deal for the third time.Meanwhile, a possible trade deal between the US and China does seem to be inching forward. The previous deadline of March 31st is now irrelevant and optimists think it could now happen by May or June.The overall mood in the stock markets is one of consolidation. Here we can see several of the top stock indices from around the world. The most impressive here is the China 50 (white line), which has managed to hold much of it\u2019s early gains.Turkish MeltdownEmerging market currencies are once again on the chopping block as analysts continue to downgrade expectations and the Turkish Lira is bearing the brunt of the volatility.Following a 7% plunge on Friday (purple rectangle), in what was intended as a defensive move, Turkish authorities have allegedly blocked banks from lending Liras to foreigners. The move makes it more difficult for people to short the currency and forces buyers to enter the spot market.However, strict capital controls only tend to work temporarily, especially in a market that is keen to sell. As we can see, the Lira continues to weaken this morning.(Please note: the USDTRY shows US Dollar strength against the Lira, so an upward move means the Lira is falling.)Local elections in Turkey will be held on Sunday, so keep your eyes open.Alt Season ContinuesThe large-cap winner of altseason over the last few days has clearly been EOS. The price graph will just kind of show a hockey stick at the moment, so instead let\u2019s take a look at the comparative tool from CoinDesk, which shows it outperforming in the network category and second only to Ethereum in development.As the Network progresses and we see more on chain transactions, it should influence the value as well. Though I wasn\u2019t able to find any historical transaction chart for EOS (if anyone has one hook me up!), it\u2019s estimated that there were more than 4 million transactions from nearly 100,000 active addresses over the last 24 hours.In the meantime, we can also see transactions on the bitcoin blockchain spiking again. Of course, this spike most likely due to the fact that Veriblock is now live, and is settling transactions from other blockchains back onto Bitcoin\u2019s main chain.In this graph, we can see the effect that Veriblock is having on Bitcoin\u2019s TPS (transactions per second) rate. The red circle is when their test-net was terminated on March 4th. The black circle is when the main-net was launched on Monday.So, it\u2019s not only the altcoins that are gaining in usage. Even bitcoin is managing to become more useful as interoperability increases.As always, many thanks for your high level of participation in these daily market updates.

From the earliest days of cavemen discovering fire to today\u2019s extensive power grids, energy has always been the lifeblood of human advancement. However, in recent decades, the downsides of producing these large amounts of energy have become apparent. From finite resources like fossil fuels, through the pollution brought upon by coal burning, to the dangers of nuclear energy \u2013 the world is in dire need of clean, sustainable energy in order to keep going. Polluted skies and bodies of water, continued depletion of natural resources, and an ongoing increase in non-renewable energy consumption have brought the human race to the edge of catastrophe. However, there are numerous entities fighting these phenomena by creating new means of sustainable energy production and deploying significant infrastructure to support it. The world has run on non-renewable energy for too long, and a growing number of companies and governments are realising that clean energy must be more widely adopted.The sustainable energy industry has the potential to completely revolutionise the global energy sector \u2013 and carries an exciting investment opportunity, as the renewable energy market is expected to reach a massive $2.1 trillion by 2025\u00b9. It is no wonder, then, that both veteran energy corporations and innovative new companies are exploring, developing and implementing new, sustainable means of producing energy.The damage is doneIt is quite clear that the energy sources that have powered the world since the beginning of the industrial revolution are finite and that non-renewable energy will eventually run out. While this might sound ominous, it is actually a good opportunity for well-established energy firms and sustainable energy entrepreneurs to generate new revenue streams from sustainable energy sources.After all, the world will never stop needing energy. On the contrary, as technology advances and more aspects of our daily lives become technology-dependent, one can assume that global power consumption will likely continue to rise. Investing in sustainable energy solutions will not only be positive for the environment, it may very well be one of the most promising investment opportunities.Cleaning up the futureSo how can humanity restore the damage and set a course to a cleaner future? The answer is multifaceted. There are numerous industries that are part of the ongoing pollution of the globe, all of which now have players that are trying to reverse the damage. Some focus on energy production methods that are more environmentally friendly, as these become the preferred energy source in some countries\u00b2, while others focus on improving the way existing industries produce and consume energy.Naturally, an emphasis is placed on producing energy from coal and fossil fuel alternatives, such as solar energy and wood fiber, as they offer reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. These go alongside improved electrical infrastructure, that increases efficiency of energy consumption and is constructed using environmentally-friendly methods and materials. Another major cause of emission is the transportation industry, which is being revolutionised with an ongoing shift to electric vehicles and constant innovation in battery charging.Investing in clean energyAs stated before, the sustainable energy sector is expected to reach a market cap of more than $2 trillion over the next few years. Naturally, as humanity progresses towards cleaner and greener means of energy production, the financial aspect of the renewable energy sector will grow, and an increasing number of investment opportunities will arise. To give its clients exposure to this sector, eToro created the RenewableEnergy CopyPortfolio, which offers a diversified, long-term investment strategy in clean energy. To follow its performance, you can add the CopyPortfolio to your Watchlist on eToro.Add RenewableEnergy to WatchlistThe RenewableEnergy CopyPortfolio offers a thematic investment opportunity in renewable energy companies, comprising various stocks of organisations operating across multiple segments of the industry, in different locations around the world.The Portfolio was created with diversity in mind, offering stocks from solar energy pioneers, such as SolarEdge, waste management companies, such as Renewi, and several other companies covering sectors relevant to the sustainable energy industry.Sources:https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/renewable-energy-markethttps://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/industry/power-and-utilities/global-renewable-energy-trends.htmlThis content is intended for informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or an investment recommendation.

The pilot scheme will be in partnership with Toronto-based Coinberry, who simultaneously announced a new easy-to-use cryptocurrency payment solution.\u2018Tax Payments in BTC\u2019 Trend Reaches CanadaAccepting bitcoin for payment of taxes is becoming a thing south of Canada\u2019s border. After a mad scramble a year ago to be America\u2019s crypto-tax pioneer, a Florida county eventually won through to become the first US locality to accept tax payments in bitcoin.By the end of 2018, Ohio had \u2018planted their flag\u2018 for Bitcoin-adoption, with state-wide acceptance of BTC business-tax payments. Last month it looked like New Hampshire would be next to see the trend continue Northwards. However, with this announcement, Innisfil has leapfrogged New Hampshire for a further hop north into Canada.Innisfil Mayor, Lynn Dolan, expressed her excitement at the development:\u2026we are proud to be first in taking this bold step by offering this new, exciting payment option to our residents. There\u2019s no doubt that cryptocurrency is growing in usage and popularity. By getting into this now, we are making sure our municipality is ahead of the game, and signalling to the world that we truly are a future-ready and innovative community.The Logistics Of The SchemeFrom April, just in time for residents to pay their second property tax instalment, they will see a new option on the town website. This will initially offer the option of paying in BTC, but may expand to include other cryptocurrencies in the future.Residents will pay taxes into the Town of Innisfil\u2019s wallet using the Coinberry Pay service. Coinberry will process the funds and instantly convert them into Canadian dollars, and transfer them to the town\u2019s treasury. This gives the benefit of a cryptocurrency option, without leaving the town exposed to price fluctuations.Coinberry CEO and Co-founder, Andrei Poliakov added:Leaders from all levels of government who are first to recognize the benefits of the \u2018new money economy\u2019 will be the first to reap the rewards. We are extremely pleased at achieving a milestone in the history of adoption of cryptocurrency in Canada.From The North And South To The East And WestSo with the eastern part of North America covered, will we start to see some lateral movement? Certainly it can\u2019t be too long before blockchain-friendly Wyoming joins the party, giving the movement a decent kick to the west. For perhaps the most progressive state in the US, it seems strange that crypto-payments aren\u2019t already a thing there.And we could even see a hop eastwards all the way across the Atlantic if UK member of parliament, Eddie Hughes has his way. The Walsall North Labour MP, has called for a UK local authority to \u2018plant its own flag\u2019, and start accepting bitcoin payments for taxes.Should more municipalities accept cryptocurrencies for tax payments?

According to the American multinational financial services companies\u2019 CEOs, blockchain technology is still overhyped and its use-cases for the industry are still unproven \u2014 which is almost downright laughable, given the fact that anyone reading this can transfer value overseas with Bitcoin (BTC) faster than they can with a Wells Fargo bank transfer (and for lower fees).Despite the fact that Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain (and others, for that matter) have proven themselves capable of facilitating speedy and low-fee trustless transactions, Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan thinks blockchain technology is overhyped. He stated on stage in San Francisco:Blockchain has been way oversold. I think the fundamental technology is very interesting, but it\u2019s been very slow to roll out [\u2026] If you turned the clock back a few years ago, it should have completely changed the industry \u2014 that\u2019s just not the way it works.Still, Sloan through in a little footnote, stating, \u201cOver time, I think it\u2019ll have an impact.\u201dYou think?Meanwhile, Mastercard CEO Ajaypal Banga also has some issues with the increasingly not-so-nascent technology, stating:I think blockchain could be interesting, but the business model is not proven. A lot of this has to improve and change over time.These statements were made together with Sloan, on the same stage, in a seemingly coordinated effort.It is worth noting that Mastercard, according to CNBC, as the third most blockchain patents. The company with the most, Bank of America, recently saw its Chief Operations Officer state that she is bearish on the technology:I haven\u2019t seen one [use case] that even scales beyond an individual or a small set of transactions. All of the big tech companies will come and say \u2018blockchain, blockchain, blockchain.\u2019 I say, \u2018Show me the use case. You bring me the use case and I\u2019ll try it\u2019. [\u2026] I want it to work. Spiritually, I want it to make us better, faster, cheaper, more transparent, more, you know, all of those things.At this point, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to take these kinds of opinions seriously.What do you think of Wells Fargo, Mastercard, and Bank of America\u2019s bearish statements against distributed ledger technology? Do you agree that they are well aware of the use-cases for the technology, but merely spewing negative rhetoric for their own purposes? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

Envion AG is currently being liquidated.FINMA\u2019s enforcement proceedings against the company began in July 2018 and have concluded this month. Its investigation discovered that more than 90 million Swiss francs had been raised by the company in the form of an initial coin offering \u2014 a once-popular and now-notorious fundraising method that exploded during the cryptocurrency bull run of 2017. This initial coin offering was conducted without a proper statutory license and thus \u201cseriously violated supervisory law,\u201d according to an official press release.The unlicensed ICO offered investors EVN tokens in exchange for US dollars, ether, or bitcoins. Token owners were reportedly granted \u201ca claim to repayment after thirty years,\u201d despite the fact that Envion AG lacked a banking license. Explains FINMA:The conditions for the EVN tokens issued in a bond-like form were not equal for all investors, the prospectuses did not meet the minimum statutory requirements and there was no internal audit unit as required by law. In the present case, this acceptance of US dollars and the Ethereum and Bitcoin cryptocurrencies therefore amounted to an acceptance of public deposits for the purposes of the Banking Act. This however requires a banking licence.FINMA\u2019s supervisory role, in this case, is now finished, as bankruptcy proceedings against Envion AG have been opened by the Cantonal Court of Zug. However, the financial regulator has noted that it \u201cwill continue to consistently take action against ICO business models which violate or circumvent supervisory law.\u201d FINMA is not afraid to liquidate companies that ran illegal ICOs.What do you think about FINMA\u2019s actions against Envion AG?

As Bitcoinist reported, BTC/USD had struggled to hold on to support around $4000 this week, with analysts warning downside could be imminent should the pair fail to close out the month above $3800. With Friday\u2019s push, however, this scenario appears all the less likely.At press time, bitcoin price had slowed slightly to come down off its multi-month top, currently trading closer to $4050 on Bitstamp.Longer-term, BTC/USD is still down almost 40 percent compared to its position six months ago, with the impact of November\u2019s Bitcoin Cash hard fork debacle still weighing on market sentiment.Altcoin markets appeared slightly buoyed by upward BTC price momentum meanwhile, with Ethereum stemming previous losses to reclaim its $140 level. The largest altcoin by market cap has yet to challenge any longer-term highs, having hit $155 late last month but remaining broadly lower since November.Not Out Of The Bear WoodsPrice performance, however, may yet not be a cause for celebration for long. As analysts reacted to markets, some eyed network phenomena as suggesting mixed territory could continue. Others, such as developer Nic Carter, noted the expanding mempool \u2013 the size of the cache of Bitcoin\u2019s unconfirmed transactions \u2013 is increasing rapidly, something which pushes up fees. \u201cThe era of low fees won\u2019t last forever. Consolidate your inputs while you still have time,\u201d he warned on social media. As Bitcoinist previously noted, fees had hit rock bottom in recent times, thanks in part to the increased propagation of Segregated Witness (\u2018SegWit\u2019). Should bitcoin price continue to expand in the short term, commentators will be eyeing metrics from the industry in the face of controversy which centers on fake volume statistics from exchanges. Two reports this month drew similar conclusions about the issue, which has led to trade volumes being considerably exaggerated. This, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao added, impacts negatively on a coin\u2019s reputation among experienced investors with market knowledge.

While the seemingly low prices involved could be true for smaller blockchains with easily-rentable hashpower, larger players \u2013 specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2013 are unable to be commandeered simply through renting from a provider such as NiceHash.\u201cMost bigger cryptocurrencies have sufficient mining capacity behind them, making it extremely expensive to acquire the necessary hardware to pull an attack like this off,\u201d researchers explained. Smaller cryptocurrencies have less hashing power securing the network, making it possible to simply rent hashing power from miners on a service like Nicehash for a few hours.Asked why he did not follow through with the threat, Larimer brought up the criminal implications of doing so. \u201cThat would be illegal,\u201d he responded to a Twitter query. Familiar CriticismsWere such a scenario to arise, it would likely echo the \u201cstress tests\u201d performed on altcoin Bitcoin Cash last year, an extensive effort which itself generated no end of tension among rival developers and investors.The episode meanwhile is not the first to involve Larimer and controversial statements about his projects and decentralized alternatives. In June last year, weeks after the long-awaited debut of EOS, Larimer proposed scrapping its constitution completely and starting again with a new set of rules. The platform and associated token have nonetheless proven popular, despite repeated doubts of its governance structure, which places power in the hands of just 21 so-called \u2018Block Producers\u2019 (BPs).Subsequently, it appeared moderators of the network could even reverse transactions that were previously included in blocks and propagated.

Gox Bitcoin exchange says he will appeal his conviction on electronic data manipulation charges. Meanwhile, prosecutors on the case have announced their decision not to appeal Karpel\u00e8s\u2019 acquittal on embezzlement charges.Karpel\u00e8s is also a Victim of the Mt. Gox HackAccording to the Associated Press (AP), Karpel\u00e8s\u2019 lawyer, Nobuyasu Ogata believes his client\u2019s actions during the Mt. Gox saga were tailored towards minimizing the risk exposure of the platform\u2019s users.Ogata\u2019s comments come in the wake of the decision of the Tokyo District Court to convict the former Mt. Gox chief on data manipulation charges. Karpel\u00e8s was, however, found not guilty of embezzlement and was handed a suspended sentence which means no jail time unless he is found guilty of another crime within the next four years.Karpel\u00e8s\u2019 lawyer expressed delight at the latter ruling of the court, calling it \u201ca proper decision.\u201d However, the ex Mt. Gox CEO plans to appeal his conviction on data manipulation charges, as revealed in an email to AP, which reads in part:During the opening of my trial in 2017, I swore to God that I am innocent of all charges. I believe appealing to the judgment is appropriate so that I can be judged again in full consideration of all the facts.In a statement quoted by AP, Ogata maintained that Karpel\u00e8s actions couldn\u2019t be construed as illegitimate. Ogata even went further to state that Karpel\u00e8s was as much a victim of the Mt. Gox hack as were the platform users and any guilty verdict was akin to scapegoating his client.Prosecution Won\u2019t Appeal Court RulingIn a related development, prosecutors on the case say they will not be pursuing an appeal of the court\u2019s decision to acquit Karpel\u00e8s of embezzlement charges. According to inside sources who spoke to local Japanese media outlet, The Mainichi, prosecutors have decided to abide by the court\u2019s ruling.At the start of proceedings, Karpel\u00e8s faced the possibility of a ten-year sentence over charges of unlawfully misappropriating $3 million in customer deposits for personal use. These withdrawals allegedly went towards the acquisition of a software developer, as well as other personal expenditure.The court ruled that the business expenditure was legitimate and that all personal spending amounted to loans from Mt. Gox which Karpel\u00e8s had every intention of repaying.Do you think Mark Karpel\u00e8s got off easy? Share your thoughts with us in the comments below.Image courtesy of Bitcoinist archives.

This is the highest network activity since BTC price was well above $10,000 USD in early January 2018.It\u2019s also worth noting that the proportion of Bitcoin payments made using Segregated Witness (SegWit) has also been gradually since its activation in summer 2017. These now comprise nearly half of all on-chain Bitcoin transactions, according to the latest data. SegWit has proven to be a successful step in mitigating transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. Since peaking in December 2017, the cost of using Bitcoin has been at record lows despite the network processing more transactions on average.1MB+ Bitcoin Block Size is the New NormalThe BTC network is now also regularly producing blocks over the 1MB block size limit that was in place before SegWit activation that made 4MB blocks possible.The latest daily average block size, for example, has spiked to 1.2MB, though blocks well over 2MB and greater are now quite common.Earlier this week, Bitcoinist reported that independent ratings agency Weiss Ratings, has upgraded Bitcoin\u2019s tech/adoption rating to an \u2018A\u2019 in light of rising network metrics.Weiss noted:Since February 2018, the volume of user (on-chain) transactions among the ten most widely used cryptocurrencies has grown by 245 percent.The agency also notes that Bitcoin is a \u201cproven leader in adoption\u201d and that \u201cits value is not controlled by monetary authorities, and it can be a safe haven in times of turmoil.\u201dUnlike [gold], it costs virtually nothing to store or transport.VeriBlock Likely Behind the SpikeIndeed, rising network usage, in addition to some notable adoption milestones in recent weeks, has kept the BTC price buyoant, particularly as of late.However, some analysts have once again noted that VeriBlock may be responsible for the spike in block size and transaction count.As Bitcoinist reported last month, Veriblock is a startup that uses Bitcoin\u2019s OP_RETURN outputs to embed additional data for their \u2018proof-of-proof\u2019 miners. Regardless, Bitcoin\u2019s network is open-access, therefore, anyone can use it for whatever reason as long as the miner fees are paid.Earlier this yer, Casa CTO Jameson Lopp was one of the first people to point out that the startup comprised a large share of on-chain transactions.\u201cVeriBlock miners posted 783,000 transactions to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain in December and are on track for 1,500,000 in January,\u201d he wroteMeanwhile, developer Nic Carter, noted today the expanding mempool \u2013 the size of the cache of Bitcoin\u2019s unconfirmed transactions \u2013 is increasing rapidly, something which pushes up fees.Mempool filling up.

All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsIt\u2019s the last trading day of the first quarter of 2019 and there have been fairly few surprises so far this year. The stock market has put up an excellent performance as the central banks continue to provide support to a global economy threatened by geopolitical tensions.Next Tuesday, we\u2019ll be holding our quarterly webcast to discuss Q2 and what to expect from the markets. Remember that in Q1\u2019s webcast we stated that most of the trading opportunities were likely to come around the middle of the year, so now is the time to start paying close attention.For all the details and to reserve your please please click this link now: Join the Q2 Forecast Webcast with Mati Greenspan Gold PlungeEven though the Fed announced a much more dovish tone in their last meeting, the US Dollar continues to test its upper limits. One would think that weakness from the Fed would be met by weakness in the Greenback and that fewer interest rate rises would send the Dollar down, but in fact, we can see it is holding up rather well.Here\u2019s the US Dollar Index, which is testing its resistance at 97.30 (upper yellow line).With the Dollar on the rise and geopolitical tensions seeming to ebb, gold took a rather sudden dip yesterday falling slightly below $1,300 and forming a new support line (yellow).Zooming out on the graph we can see that gold is pretty much at the same level that it was at the beginning of 2018. It remains unclear exactly why it took a massive dip June and July even though the US Dollar remained stable in comparison, but for now, it seems to have recovered from that dip.As long as inflation remains subdued and trust in the central bank system remains intact gold doesn\u2019t have much reason to rise. It still remains in my own portfolio, perhaps a bit less than before though.Crypto MarketsBitcoin is at its highest level in more than a month this morning, currently testing resistance around $4,200 per coin (dotted white line). Some analysts might note that it seems the long term bear trend line (yellow) has now been broken.However, trendlines may be drawn differently by each chartist so this isn\u2019t the purest indicator out there. What\u2019s more pertinent at the moment is the 200 day moving average (blue) that draws ever nearer.Altseason continues. Bitcoin is rising today but still sees its dominance waning as other coins go up faster. At the moment, the BTC dominance indicator stands at 50.2%.Personally, I don\u2019t see any specific significance of a move below 50%. However, enough people have mentioned it to me that I would say such a move could have a significant impact on sentiment. No doubt bitcoin losing the majority of crypto market share would create headlines and cause more analysts to cry altseason.Wishing you a peaceful and relaxing weekend.Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalysteToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

Bithumb also said that it was collaborating with other platforms to trace and recover the stolen funds.An excerpt from the statement reads:Our members\u2019 KRW deposit/withdrawal service is normally available, and we will do our best to secure the stability of the service and to resume as soon as possible. Specific resumption schedule will be announced through a separate announcement.Another Bithumb Hack?The Bithumb statement comes almost 24 hours after reports first emerged on Twitter of another Bithumb hack.

This prevented banks from completing a number of transactions, further highlighting the issues of centralized systems. Bitcoin\u2019s uptime, on the other hand, remains 99.98% since inception. Federal Reserve: Fedwire Goes DownAccording to several users on different social media, Fedwire, the real-time gross settlement system, owned and operated by the 12 Federal Reserve banks in the US, wen off for a few minutes today, April 2nd.One of the users has taken the matter to Reddit, detailing the following:Today the United States Federal Reserve experienced an unexpected issue and went completely down. No incoming or outgoing wires went through in the entire country. It\u2019s still unresolved and yet not one single news outlet seems to be reporting on this and the massive impact it has.According to the official website that monitors the current status of the services provided by the Federal Reserve, Fedwire Funds has since been enabled.However, an Instagram user managed to screenshot the status page at the time when it was off.What is Fedwire Funds?Fedwire is the system for real-time gross settlement of central bank money used to electronically settle USD payments amongst its members. The system is owned and also operated by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks in the US.However, it\u2019s a massive network for payment processing in between the member banks, as well as other institutions which participate. These include American branches of foreign banks, depository financial institutions and so forth.To get a sense of the massive scale of its operations, Fedwire has processed upwards of $2.8 trillion on a daily basis in January 2019. In comparison, Bitcoin transferred upwards of $3.2 trillion for the entire 2018.Why Does it Matter?Fedwire Funds plays a crucial role in processing payments between member banks throughout the entire country. As such, while being offline, transactions were reportedly delayed or failed.The user who brought up the Reddit thread mentioned above, explains the severity of the issues associated with Fedwire\u2019s downtime:I work in a job that requires wire transfers and all wires were not sent or received after about noon/1 ish west coast time. I assume most people weren\u2019t as aware because of the typical cutoff time anyway. But we had several deals today that couldn\u2019t be completed because none of the banks could send us money and we couldn\u2019t send any out either.Will We Ever Learn?While there doesn\u2019t appear to be an explanation for Fedwire\u2019s recently reported downtime, it\u2019s yet another example of the issues with centralized systems. This is not the first time it happened, as Visa and Wells Fargo had experienced issues of the kind in the past. However, it does seem like if things don\u2019t change, we\u2019re likely to see more of the same.Decentralization could solve a lot of the vulnarabilities that are inherent to centralized systems and single points of failure. It\u2019s perhaps problems like this that further highlight the strength of Bitcoin which, up to the current date, boasts 99.9835% uptime since inception.What do you think of Fedwire reportedly going down?

The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surged to slightly above $5,000 yesterday morning, which was cause for celebration for many Bitcoin bulls looking for signs of a market bottom. Some in the mainstream media, however, are still in the business of throwing shade and spreading some FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).In a column titled \u201cBitcoin Is Surging Again. Just Ignore It.\u201d Leonid Bershidsky prefaces his opinion piece by stating,Whatever the explanation, there\u2019s no good reason to turn bullish on crypto.But is he really struggling to find a good reason? If so, we can help him.No Good News (Except The Good News)Bershidsky boldly claims that there has been no good news about cryptocurrencies, stating:There has been no good news about cryptocurrencies lately \u2014 they aren\u2019t acquiring greater acceptance as investments or payments, and the crypto experiments of central banks, governments and major companies haven\u2019t moved beyond dabbling. There\u2019s been bad news, though \u2014 more big hacks, more dying currencies, more pump-and-dump schemes (sometimes, the extinctions and the schemes go together).Maybe Bershidsky doesn\u2019t read Bitcoinist or is intentionally oblivious.Yesterday, Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network, a second-layer scaling solution, reached a significant milestone of $5 million in capacity. Authorities at the Kiev City State Administration (KCSA) are reportedly re-examining the merits of adopting Bitcoin (BTC) payments in the city\u2019s public transport system.Bitcoin\u2019s on-chain transactions have steadily climbed and recently reached all-time highs. The town of Innisfil, Ontario will soon be the first municipality in Canada to accept bitcoin in payment for property taxes. And this is all in the past two weeks, alone.Only someone intentionally disregarding fundamental developments in the Bitcoin landscape would state what Bershidsky states in his FUD-piece.Technically SpeakingDisregarding fundamentals, there are plenty of technical indicators per classical technical analysis theory to suggest a large green candle was inbound \u2014 but Bershidsky apparently disregards these, too, writing:Given the small real trading volumes, any number of events could have caused Tuesday\u2019s spike: A \u201cmystery buyer\u201d who placed a $100 million Bitcoin purchase order on multiple exchanges, or even trading bots going crazy over an April Fools\u2019 Day story saying the SEC has approved two crypto exchange-traded funds. It could be neither: Perhaps enough retail investors saw all the optimistic tweets and drove the market up, which sparked a frenzy based on the fear of missing out, as sometimes happens in small, wild markets.Bershidsky should have listened to Bitcoinist\u2019s market analyst FilbFilb, who clearly predicted this price increase was a strong possibility. The market-leading cryptocurrency was knocking on the door of its upward resistance \u2014 the top of a rising wedge formation. Breaking out of said wedge all but guaranteed an explosive move to the upside.Overall, Bershidsky\u2019s response to Bitcoin\u2019s move should be disregarded, since taking advice on the cryptocurrency market from mainstream media FUDsters is rarely sound advice \u2014 especially when Bloomberg\u2019s writers are rewarded for moving the market.What do you think of Bitcoin\u2019s price increase?

This means they should be in the realm of \u2018professional investors\u2019 only.To be clear, it doesn\u2019t matter if savvy investors have made the right call on the market or sharpened their trading skills. If they don\u2019t have a portfolio of at least $1 million (HK $8 million), STOs are off the table for them. The announcement comes after the SFC launched its regulatory sandbox for cryptocurrency companies in November 2018. In a statement on Thursday, the SFC said that security tokens fall into the same category as securities, which meant that they were subject to the same existing laws.Foreign Entities Can No Longer Freely Target Hong Kong InvestorsThe latest crackdown on STOs, which have become a compliant replacement to ICOs in just about every corner of the world, is not limited to companies based in the region. According to the SFC statement, anyone marketing or distributing security tokens targeting Hong Kong investors must obtain a local license.Moreover, digital asset providers must comply with three key requirements laid out by the SFC. They must restrict their offerings to professional investors only. They must provide clear and comprehensive investment advice and guidelines, and must encourage investors to carry out their own due diligence. If they fail to do this, they will either lose their license or trigger \u201cdisciplinary action\u201d from the financial watchdog. According to the statement:It is a criminal offence for any person to engage in regulated activities without a licence unless an exemption applies.SFC: Not an Outright Ban But Almost as BadICOs are all but dead.

This time he says that some companies and wealthy individuals in Russia have bought 1.8 million bitcoin (about $8.6 billion).OFAC Sanctions Will Push Russia to BitcoinGinko doubled down on his previous comments. He told Bitcoinist:1.8 million BTC were bought by Russian companies and wealthy Russians. There is no direct involvement of Russian state but some who buy bitcoin are awaiting that the increasing US sanctions will make impossible to do international transactions as usual so they purchase bitcoin as a way to circumvent US sanctions.According to Ginko, Russia\u2019s pivot towards Bitcoin is due to mounting sanctions by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The Kremlin economist, says Russian oligarchs are stockpiling BTC to ensure continued oil and gas deals even when OFAC bans the use of U.S. dollars by Russian oil companies.He adds:There is no direct influence of Russia\u2019s purchases to the bitcoin price but in mid-term it starts playing role in driving bitcoin higher. Russia\u2019s companies and people, especially those who are under risk being put on OFAC list, have to purchase bitcoins indirectly, buying up digital wallets when they may formally still belong to some US citizens.Others Say Russian Gov\u2019t Buying BTC Makes No SenseGinko is no stranger to making bold claims about Russian involvement in BTC. Earlier in the year, Ginko\u2019s comments about the Kremlin looking to make a $10 billion investment in Bitcoin caused quite a stir.In the wake of Ginko\u2019s earlier statements, many experts reacted calling the statements ludicrous. As reported by Bitcoinist at the time, one senior government official also denied the rumors, saying the government buying bitcoin is \u201cunlikely in the next 30 years.\u201dThis time around, Ginko who is a member of the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA), clarified that the government currently has no part in the BTC investment.Concerning critics who question the validity of his claims, Ginko had this to say:I\u2019m deeply involved in political and economic affairs of Russia frequently cited person in Russia\u2019s media.Bitcoin Price $2 Million by End of 2019Ginko also believes that the weight of Russia\u2019s BTC involvement will push Bitcoin price to stratospheric heights before the end of 2019. According to Ginko, BTC will top $2 million by the end of 2019.When I've predicted that Russia's rush to avoid sanctions will bring about $2,000,000 per Bitcoin at the end of current year, many were stalled. But Moscow has already bought 1,8 million BTC to secure oil&gas deals when US dollars will be banned by OFAC for Russian companies.\u2014 Vladislav Ginko (@martik) April 2, 2019The top-ranked cryptocurrency began the day with a bullish breakout beyond $4,200 to briefly reach $5,000. A slight pullback has seen the price drop to the $4,800 mark.Today\u2019s gains saw bitcoin price reaching its highest price level in 5 months with many analysts declaring the end of the 15-month long bear market.

And in some parts of North America, natural gas is becoming pretty much exactly that.The Oil Industry Produces More Gas Than It Can HandleNatural gas prices in North America have tanked. As an unavoidable by-product of the oil drilling industry, producers have more than they know what to do with. Transporting it for sale is often not economically viable, so many oil companies just burn (flare) or vent it into the atmosphere.Thankfully, at least some places in America have limits on how many gas suppliers can pointlessly burn or release. This has lead to natural gas selling for less than nothing in some parts of Texas, as haulage firms are paid to take it away. The alternative is for producers to shut down wells, which is even more costly.\u201cMuch of the time Bitcoin mining happens with super cheap electricity, in many cases utilizing energy that would have otherwise gone to waste,\u201d commented eToro market analyst, Mati Greenspan.Converting Gas To Electricity For Powering Mining RigsA better solution would be to find a productive way to use natural gas at the source. Which is why a shipping container full of mining rigs is sitting in a remote Canadian oil field. The project is the brainchild of oilman and bitcoin entrepreneur, Stephen Barbour.The container has a generator attached to convert natural gas into electricity to power the rigs. The unit uses about 400 cubic meters per day, which allows the wells to operate 24/7. A production foreman for the oil company, Black Pearl Resources, explains:It was the best option for us. We\u2019re using it to bring ourselves below the government-regulated amount that we can vent on location and keep producing oil.And Mr. Barbour is more than happy to be building himself a healthy stash of bitcoin. Moreover, he explains that Bitcoin is a liberating technology for humanity. It transforms energy that would otherwise be wasted \u201cruns computers\u201d to calculate small numbers providing \u201cfinancial freedom for people all over the world.\u201dSun shines.Water absorbs heat.Rejects into atmosphere.Falls.Drives turbine.Moves electrons.Runs computer.Calculates small numbers.Financial freedom for people all over the world.#bitcoin\u2014 Steve Barbour \u26cf (@SGBarbour) March 20, 2019Not a Solution For EveryoneWhilst solutions of this kind are spreading, they are not suitable for all situations. The capital outlay of buying and converting a shipping container can be up to $130,000, even before factoring in the price of mining rigs.A company mining bitcoin in data-centers in South Dakota and Texas had to say no to energy partnerships with local natural gas producers due to the infrastructure costs involved. Another analyst estimated that using free natural gas, it would require an average bitcoin price over the next 15 years to be nearly $19,000 to make a profit.The other problem is getting oil-industry people to understand cryptocurrency. Barbour introduced his container at an oil show to a non-plussed crowd.Locally, pretty much nobody knows what bitcoin is.Earlier this month, Bitcoinist reported that, in fact, alternative sources of energy such as solar can even provide even more competitive advantage for miners depending on their location, cutting operating costs by as much as 75 percent.Meanwhile, a November 2018 report found that bitcoin miners often prefer cheaper alternatives to oil and gas, with as much as 80 percent running on renewables.Is Bitcoin a useful technology for utilizing energy that would otherwise go to waste?

Georgi Georgiev | Mar 30, 2019 | 12:00 Share Tweet Send Share Algeria, one of North Africa\u2019s largest producers of oil and gas, is currently going through serious political and economic turmoil. Amid the current unrest, it\u2019s perhaps high-time for the country to reconsider its position on Bitcoin as it has proven itself as a viable alternative during times of upheaval. Algeria: Arab Spring 2.0?Algeria, officially the People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Algeria, is going through major political and economic turmoil. The country is the largest in Africa and it\u2019s also amongst the biggest producers of oil and gas in the world. However, for the past few weeks, waves of protests and demonstrations have attempted to block the possible re-election of the current president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who\u2019s been serving on the post for 20 years.Even though the president has promised to step down following the next elections scheduled for April 18th, demonstrations continued.The current situation in Algeria painfully reminds of what happened in neighboring Tunisia as well as in Egypt back in 2011, which became known as the \u2018Arab Spring.\u2019 In Egypt in particular, millions of protesters from a broad range of socio-economic, as well as religious backgrounds, demanded the resignation of the long-standing Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. He was an acting president from 1981 to 2011 \u2013 a total of 30 years.Looking at Algeria, there\u2019s a similar pattern when it comes to the current political structures. The country is run by an old president, supported by a reportedly corrupt political party, while Algeria\u2019s economy is struggling. Problems such as mismanagement, paternalistic political views, as well as clientism are all at the forefront.This comes in spite of the fact that Algeria is a large oil producer, having 12.2 billion barrels of proven oil reserves. The country exports about 540,000 barrels per day (b/d) or roughly half of its total production of about 1.1 million b/d.Time to Lift Ban on BitcoinFollowing similar steps taken by its neighbor Morocco, Algeria banned bitcoin back in 2018 with the introduction of the country\u2019s yearly Finance Act. Per the reports, not only is it prohibited to transact using Bitcoin, but also to hold it.However, Bitcoin has managed to prove itself as a viable alternative to fiat currencies in times of political and economic unrest.One such example would be Iran. Economic instability in the country due to US sanctions has led to hyperinflation of its national currency, the rial. This has resulted in some citizens seeking alternatives to access to the global economy as well as preserve wealth. Fortunately, Iran has relaxed its stance on Bitcoin earlier this year as it makes way for its own national digital currency, according to reports.But perhaps the most notable example would be that of Venezuela. Once Latin America\u2019s richest country, Venezuela is going through a political and economic crisis and severe hyperinflation, which reached a staggering 2.30 million percent in February.Capital controls and a shortage of foreign currency have left residents with the only choice to secure their wealth through Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As such, trading on peer-to-peer platform LocalBitcoins has surged in the country.It also shows that Bitcoin is a lot more than just a speculative asset to people in countries facing economic and political instability. Therefore, perhaps it\u2019s high time for the government in Algeria to reconsider its ban on Bitcoin and give its citizen the freedom to use an alternative to the Dinar, which has lost almost 80 percent of its value against the US dollar over the past 5 years.What\u2019s more, despite the official ban, the LocalBitcoins trading platform still works in Algeria, proving the politically neutral, decentralized and borderless nature of Bitcoin.Would Algeria benefit from lifting the ban on Bitcoin?

Bitcoin\u2019s development is occurring exponentially,\u201d the company summarized. If it maintains this pace, in another 10 years, it will surpass all competition.Visa first appeared on the market in 1958, followed by MasterCard in 1966. PayPal, which launched in 1998, has already established itself as a competitor to the industry veterans, while Bitcoin\u2019s progress is even more rapid. DataLight meanwhile goes further, forecasting that despite its current technical hurdles, Bitcoin will become the preeminent payment network of the world.\u201cRight now Bitcoin\u2019s payment system is much superior to the conventional international payments and wire transfers,\u201d it continued. Technical improvement of Bitcoin\u2019s network is almost certain to make it the world\u2019s main payment system.\u2018Surprising\u2019 StatisticsDataLight\u2019s buoyant advocacy of Bitcoin stems from analysis of its current network activity. Despite lagging behind fiat-based players significant in certain areas, such as capacity, Bitcoin excels elsewhere, for example in average transaction value. For 2018, this was $41,615, compared with $90 for Visa, $80 for MasterCard and $58 for PayPal. This points to Bitcoin\u2019s utility as a transfer method of large amounts, which investors prefer due to the fee structure favoring significant sums over micropayments.In late 2018, this factor subsided even more to users\u2019 advantage, fees hitting lows to allow even tiny payments to be sent and confirmed without significant fees to miners. Off-chain scaling solutions, principally the Lightning Network, should ultimately resolve the fee competition issue definitively. \u201cThis is why the bear trend of 2018 will be another dip before the exponential growth and new all time highs,\u201d the research read.Decentralization At A GlanceElsewhere, DataLight noted the benefits of decentralization in Bitcoin, which has over 10,000 \u2018data centers\u2019 \u2013 or nodes \u2013 supporting its network, compared to 119, 98 and 51 for Visa, MasterCard and PayPal respectively.The number of Bitcoin addresses, currently around 25 million, is considerably lower than the number of credit and debit cards in circulation, but capitalization per \u2018account\u2019 also outstrips the extant payment networks.The researchers are far from alone in their bullish predictions for Bitcoin in the years to come. As Bitcoinist noted, among other major advocates are Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, in addition to industry figures such as investor Tim Draper. Dorsey, prior to increasing his public praise of both Bitcoin and the Lightning Network this year, previously said he envisaged Bitcoin becoming a form of global internet currency by 2028.

Let\u2019s take a look at the market to try to determine if we can expect more upside to come.Bitcoin Price: Daily ChartBreaking down the daily chart, we can see that bitcoin price performed a measured move right out of the Technical Analysis textbook.The Adam & Eve bottom pattern which had an added Inverse Head and shoulders, within the Eve of the cup presented a $5.1k target, which we have tracked for some time as having potential to be met via a very fast move due to there being a void in the history of traded volume in that range.Usually we would expect a throwback to retest the breakdown range, which would occur around the $4,000 level. However there still remains a volume void above $5k, which is how BTC found its way down to $3100 so quickly.Therefore, it stands to reason that a move higher should at this stage is not completely impossible to consider. This would imply a move in bitcoin price pressing on towards $5500. This $5500 level is between the 61.8 and 78.6% Fibonacci levels, which is where typically we would expect to find short interest in this instance.Hourly ChartLooking at the hourly chart, BTC price has been pressing on during Wednesday and looks like it is threatening to push higher.There is a bearish divergence on the MACD, but it is putting in higher lows on the MACD histogram. The stochastic RSI is crossed bullish in the oversold territory, so these two along with the general price action may tempt the bulls back into the market. A break of $5100 seems probable to take bitcoin higher to test $5500 at this stage.Should the bulls fail to move on, it would be reasonable to expect bitcoin price to come down to try and find support around the breakout of $4250-300, which would be close to an 80% retracement.Weekly ChartThe weekly chart shows that the Orange 50 WMA line is rapidly declining and currently at around $5700. The 50-week moving average played a pivotal role in the previous bear market in 2015, when it acted as resistance while the bulls attempted to push on to confirm the bear market had ended.Given the similarities in the timing, the retracement levels and the market structure, it would seem reasonable to assume that this could again be the case, given the confluence with the retracement levels in that area.Bear vs. Bull ScenariosAs it stands, the bear market is still not entirely over but there has been a change in the trend, with bitcoin price making a significant higher high on the weekly chart. This is also backed by a large amount of volume after it became apparent that there was more demand than supply in the $3000s.What happens next is uncertain due to the lack of BTC/USD trading history in the $5000 range. Ideally for the bulls, a consolidation range between $4000 and $6000 would now be established for the remainder of the year.For the bears, a complete failure to interest buyers at $3900 and the 50 & 100-day moving averages would signify weakness and that the market could press on lower.Trade Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

His announcement comes after Bitcoin price soared more than 20 percent in the last two days alone.\u2018The Market Has Now Turned\u2019Bitcoin price gained upwards of 20 percent in less than two days. The cryptocurrency surged from around $4150 on April 1st to its current price point of about $4,980.Historically, as its price starts to increase, so does the public interest toward it. Bitcoinist reported that Bitcoin has made it into the top ten of most searched terms on Google, hitting over 100,000 searches yesterday.While most are looking for the exact reason that caused the massive spike in Bitcoin\u2019s price, John McAfee came up with a statement that sounds a lot like \u201cI told you so.\u201d The popular entrepreneur said:Everyone trashed me two weeks ago when I said: \u201cThe market has now turned\u201d, so I\u2019ve kept my mouth shut. I will now say it again: \u201cThe market has now turned\u201d. The bow of the bear market was pulled to its max. Now watch the arrow spring to life.Apparently, McAfee suggests that we\u2019ve seen the worst from the bear market and that it\u2019s only upwards from here.\u201cI am absolutely NOT the type of person who would ever say \u201cI told you so\u201d. But. . . . . . I fu%*ng told you so!!\u201d \u2013 he tweeted today.The bullish sentiment doesn\u2019t seem to end with McAfee, though. Another Bitcoin investor and entrepreneur, Alistair Milne, also said that \u201cpretty much every OG Bitcoin trader\u201d he respects is leaning bullish days before Tuesday\u2019s price surge.$995,000 to Go By December 31st, 2020In 2017 McAfee made a particularly popular bet that Bitcoin price will move above $500,000 in three years or else he\u2019d have to consume his own manhood on national television.Amusingly, there\u2019s even a dedicated \u2018dick clock\u2019 website online counting down to the day.More recently, he has updated his prognosis, putting Bitcoin at $1 million by December 31st, 2020.Despite the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price, which brought it close to $5,000, the cryptocurrency has a long way to go before it reaches the $1 million target. To be precise, Bitcoin\u2019s price would have to gain 19,900 percent in the next 638 days.This means that Bitcoin would have to add approximately about $1,559 to its price every single day until December 31st. Pretty ambitious.Meanwhile, McAfee has also stated that he will be \u2018running\u2019 for the 2020 US Presidency in \u2018exile\u2019. In reality, though, the entrepreneur has said that he doesn\u2019t really expect to become the next US president and that he only wants the stage.What do you think about McAfee\u2019s Bitcoin price predictions?

At the same time, the relative longevity of the bull run \u2013 with the Bitcoin price holding at higher levels more than just a matter of hours \u2013 further complicates the situation for analysts.Nonetheless, some things remain the same. The price run came alongside huge increase in interest from conventional markets, with Google Trends and its equivalents proving that price means appeal for the mainstream.Others were predictably more bullish still, with Twitter trading analyst known as Vortex reiterating his belief Bitcoin would usurp all other forms of value to emerge as a dominant force.\u201cThe market has assigned a value to (Bitcoin),\u201d he wrote April 2.

It took Liquid less than five years to achieve this prized $1 billion title. Series C funds will be used for the purposes of global expansion and product development.Liquid\u2019s Series C investment round was spearheaded by IDG Capital and Bitmain Technologies, one of the world\u2019s largest (and most controversial) makers and users of cryptocurrency mining rigs. The former company is already invested in Coinbase, Ripple, Bitmain, and Kakao\u2019s cryptocurrency company, while the latter has recently invested in ErisX, a derivatives-and-crypto asset trading platform with goals to gain a license from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu, who recently stepped down as CEO after a dismal year, stated via a press release:Japan is one of the leading nations in putting crypto industry under proper regulations, and Liquid Group has proven itself to be the exemplary player within such compliant rules. This is a very important and unique moat amid global competition.Young Gao, General Partner of IDG Capital, likewise stated:IDG has been actively investing in the global crypto space since 2012, identifying some key players early. We came to realize that Tokyo has emerged as a top destination for crypto innovation and it is our honor to back such visionary pioneers as Liquid Co-founders Mike Kayamori and Mario Gomez Lozada to carry out this innovation.IDG Capital and Bitmain Technologies are not the only high-profile investors to pump funds into Liquid.

Our vision is to make financial services accessible to all, which means bringing more people into the digital asset space so that anyone can be a part of it.

On this graph, we can see an extremely high correlation between bitcoin and\u2026 avocados?A threat last Friday from President Donald J Trump to completely close the US-Mexico border has caused several markets to go a bit berserk but avocados are the pit.More than 75% of avocados in the United States come from Mexico and the United States consumes more than 75% of Mexican avocados. So tensions are high even on just the threat that this supply line might soon be closed and grocers are clearly in accumulation mode.The chart above clearly shows what can happen in a low liquid environment.The thing with avocados though, is that whatever happens in politics this situation won\u2019t last forever, it\u2019s just a temporary price spike due to external conditions. Eventually, the market will correct itself, either by political means or agriculture.In bitcoin, however, there will only ever be 21 million BTC created. Low liquidity can create price spikes but permanent scarcity is a way to ensure that higher prices are sustained over time.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystsToday\u2019s HighlightsMixed SignalsBTC Chart & VolumesCrypto Sentiment ChangingPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of April 3rd. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsA golden cross was observed recently in the US stock market and many analysts are taking this as a bullish sign.In technical analysis, a golden cross occurs when the 50 day moving average (red line) breaks above the 200 day moving average (blue). This is the opposite of a death cross.This graph of the S&P500 shows the golden cross just a few days ago. We can also see a death cross that happened in December.So the charts are showing some positive signs. The news, on the other hand, is not so spectacular.In a press conference yesterday, the World Trade Organization forecast some very strong headwinds for global growth and set their 2019 forecast at its lowest level in three years.Bitcoin is Above the CloudSuddenly, it seems that everyone is bullish on Bitcoin again. The fact that we\u2019re sustaining above the 200 day moving average and even pushing a bit higher this morning is an incredibly good sign.We might be a way off from a golden cross, but that\u2019s not the type of thing that happens in a single day of trading.For the chartists among you, I\u2019d also like to highlight this graph from @CarpeNoctom that shows Bitcoin closing above the cloud for the first time in 442 days.Looking at VolumesIt\u2019s important to note that yesterday\u2019s surge happened on strong volumes. Elevated volumes are a good indication that a specific move has weight behind it and this one is massive.The volume across the top ten crypto exchanges, as tracked by Messari, is up to about $1.3 billion, which is about $1 billion more than usual.It seems that traders on Wall Street were able to participate in the party as well. Volumes on the CME group\u2019s bitcoin futures reached a total of 12,015 contracts, which is about $294 million, so roughly 22% of the figure noted above.Even though the following figure has been proven to be false, we can also take a look at the level of volumes reported by global crypto exchanges, which topped out at $86.4 billion, their highest level ever.Of course, this last figure means absolutely nothing, but still fun to look at.Is the FOMO back?As they say in the markets, nothing changes sentiment like price. As we stated yesterday, the move was mainly technical due to crossing the $4,200 level. A barrier that had been building up over the course of months was suddenly snapped.Amplifying that sentiment are the good members of the media, who did a fantastic job yesterday of highlighting the reasons for the price move. I\u2019d like to personally thank the people at Bloomberg for having me on their show yesterday to respond to the markets in real time and to all the other financial media and crypto outlets who I\u2019ve been in contact with over the last 24 hours.It was really cool how just about everyone completely rejected the idea that this move was the result of an April Fools joke but the highlight, in my mind was a piece from Reuters, who claims that this may have been caused by a single whale.Of course, due to the anonymous nature of the crypto market, it would be impossible to prove but the theory is that a single buyer spread a buy order of 20,000 BTC across three major exchanges, thus taking out all of their order books simultaneously.If true, the mystery buyer certainly knew what he was doing. The order buildup above $4,200 that we\u2019ve been talking about would have certainly spurred on the price reaction of his order.Again, if true, this serves to highlight the price multiples laid out in this article, where an inflow of $X into the bitcoin market could very well increase the overall market cap by $X times 10 or even 20.Let\u2019s have an amazing day ahead!Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalystYour Social Investment Network \u2013 www.eToro.comeToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

For the first time ever, US regulators have found that a utility token is not considered a security. For those of you who are new, sorry we\u2019re not getting into all the details of what that means today but just know that this is a big deal.A little known token called TKJ was designed by a private jet operator called TurnKey Jet as a sort of rewards program that allows their clients to pay for services with crypto. The SEC has now declared that this project has not violated any securities laws and may continue their offering without regulatory oversight.Also, as if that wasn\u2019t enough, the SEC has also now put out a comprehensive guideline designed to clarify whether or not any specific crypto is to be considered a security token or not. There\u2019s a great summary of the above ruling and the framework in this tweet storm from Katherine Wu here. My favorite was this gem.When we\u2019re talking about programmable money, the practical applications can be quite flexible. Each utility token is set up quite differently and the SEC has decided to treat each one according to its merits on a case by case basis.This may take a while.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsHard Brexit DeadlineEthereum Technical SetupBitcoin is Blockchain in ActionPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of April 4th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsThe President of the European Commission has now announced that the April 12th deadline is final and they will not be granting any additional short time extensions. Basically, it\u2019s either Parliament approves May\u2019s deal, or they seek a long extension or a hard Brexit.Funny enough, these seem to be the same three options that have been on the table for a month, but it seems there\u2019ll be no kicking the can down the road this time.Despite all the sentiment displayed above, looking at the global indices since the beginning of the month, things don\u2019t look all that bad.Ethereum Technical SetupIt\u2019s great to see the excitement in the crypto market at the moment and even though we saw a pullback last night, the charts are still looking freakishly bullish.After a surge like that, it\u2019s quite normal to see some profit-taking. The big question now is, how far back will the retracement take us?If the prices completely retrace Tuesday morning\u2019s surge the entire thing could be discounted. If we managed to sustain here, though it would be incredible. Just take a look at this chart of Ethereum.Notice strong break above the 200 day moving average (blue) and then coming back to test that level as support. This is a really bullish setup as far as charts go.Bitcoin Blockchain in ActionOf course, with excitement in bitcoin, we do need to keep an eye out for network congestion. In December 2017, this was a major concern as there were far more transactions being sent on the network than miners were able to confirm.The adoption of SegWit has helped a lot with this as we\u2019ll see below, but looking at the mempool, the number of unconfirmed bitcoin transactions is building up a bit over the last few days.Looking at it historically though, we can see that we\u2019re not quite at dangerous levels just yet. This graph shows the mempool, which was twice flooded in 2017.Still, with about 56,000 unconfirmed transactions at the moment and transaction rates nearing their all time highs this is something to keep an eye on.The good news is that transaction times don\u2019t seem to have been affected at all. Anyone sending a bitcoin today, should get as speedy a confirmation as ever.\u2026and, perhaps more importantly, the fees have not been affected that much. There is a small noticeable spike but nothing that would prevent most people from sending a transaction today.Overall, Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is handling much better than it did in 2017. As we saw above, we\u2019re seeing nearly the same number of transactions per second, yet there have been no significant spikes in transaction times or fees.This is in large part thanks to the adoption of SegWit, an upgrade that was installed into the blockchain in August 2017, that allows some of the transaction data to be stored in a separate place.According to Woobull.com, about 40% of all Bitcoin transactions are now using the SegWit solution to lighten the load.Let\u2019s have an awesome day ahead!!Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalystYour Social Investment Network \u2013 www.eToro.comeToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

Additionally, the app is working on introducing a staking feature for Proof-of-Stake-based cryptocurrencies. Binance: Trust Wallet Adds Tezos StakingIn an official announcement, Binance revealed that its official cryptocurrency wallet of choice, Trust Wallet, has added support for Tezos (XTZ). Additionally, the app is also working on a staking feature for Proof-of-Stake-based cryptocurrencies which is \u201cset to launch by the end of the second quarter.\u201dEarlier in March, Coinbase, the leading US-based cryptocurrency exchange, made a similar move. It announced Tezos baking for its Coinbase Custody clients.While Coinbase Custody is geared towards institutional investors, Trust Wallet\u2019s new feature will allow regular Tezos holders to store their tokens while also being able to actively participate in the network\u2019s governance.Speaking on the matter was Viktor Radchenko, Founder of Trust Wallet, who said:Tezos is a leading on-chain governance and PoS protocol and we are excited to work together to bring staking and delegating mechanisms to Trust Wallet mobile users, which allows everyone to be a participant in securing the network and validating transactions.Why Is This Important?The addition of a staking feature to Trust Wallet would allow users not only to store Tezos and other PoS-based cryptocurrencies, but also to actively participate in their network governance.In the case of Tezos, for instance, its blockchain is based on a Delegated Proo-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism. By staking tokens, users can be selected to \u201cbake,\u201d which refers to the process of block creation.However, in order to be selected as a baker, a user needs to stake at least 10,000 XTZ. Hence, those who don\u2019t want to hold as much will be able to delegate them to others and receive certain returns for that.By adding staking and delegating capabilities, Trust Wallet is essentially expanding the range of options Tezos holders have.Tezos Price Fails to ReactAnnouncements of this kind are historically a precursor for a price increase. Following Coinbase\u2019s announcement in March, the price spiked with around 11 percent.However, this doesn\u2019t be the case now. Tezos (XTZ) is down about 3 percent on the day at the time of this writing, according to data from TradingView.Moreover, its price doesn\u2019t seem to be affected by the market\u2019s recent positive spike.Since April 2nd, the cryptocurrency market has gained around $30 billion to its capitalization.Leading the march was Bitcoin, soaring upwards of 20 percent throughout the past couple of days. Naturally, the spike impacted the entire market as the majority of altcoins also marked notable gains.As seen on the chart, however, Tezos wasn\u2019t one of them. Despite the announcement and the positive market development, the cryptocurrency actually depreciated in value.What do you think of the recent announcement of Binance\u2019s Trust Wallet?

Not many of them know how knee-deep Pierce is in the cryptocurrency industry, (and controversy as well).An early adopter in the space, in 2013, Pierce co-founded VC firm Blockchain Capital (BCC) which had already raised some $85 million in two venture funds by Oct 2017. He was also a large investor in Etherum and supported the early days of Coinbase. At the height of his success, Pierce was the co-founder of Block.one, the entity behind EOS. He was named by Forbes as one of crypto\u2019s top 20 richest people in February 2018. Then he was called out one month later on live television on John Oliver\u2019s show Last Week Tonight over the allegations of his involvement in an underage sex scandal in the 90s.Even though he had reached an out of court settlement over that scandal, the repercussions would linger on. Shortly after, Pierce announced his departure from EOS. Several board members of the Bitcoin Foundation also left when Pierce became Chairman.Has The Mighty Ducks Actor Fallen on Hard Times Again?Yesterday, the world\u2019s biggest crypto lender Swiss-based NEXO announced that Pierce was their first borrower to back a mortgage using cryptocurrency as collateral last November. NEXO told FOX Business that Pierce was the first person in the world to use his crypto assets to buy real estate.Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner at NEXO continued to say:He backed the entire loan for the house with bitcoin\u2026 This was our first-ever crypto-backed mortgage.With 95% of his net worth in cryptocurrencies and a less-than-squeaky-clean reputation, has Brock Pierce fallen on hard times again, needing to borrow money to buy a $1.2 million home?

They\u2019re convinced that the bull run will come again\u2013but they need to access fiat in the meantime.This is why companies like NEXO, BlockFi, Celsius, InLock, and countless others, are finding more customers. It\u2019s not just the high interest that HODLers can earn on their accounts, but the low-interest loans that are really taking off.Celsius alone has already initiated over $1 billion worth of crypto loans since June of last year\u2013and it\u2019s an incredibly appealing option. Rather than get a mortgage from a bank, these companies charge as little as 8 or 9 percent interest.And whale-sized HODLers with dwindling crypto wealth are lapping it up\u2026 Pierce reportedly told FOX Business that these types of companies are a bridge between the:old world of traditional finance and the brand new frontier that blockchain now enables.He went on to say:Being able to borrow against one\u2019s crypto assets gives one options\u2026 I was able to hold on to my crypto and settle the transaction in fiat.Will Bitcoin-backed loans become a popular way to make major purchases?

Emilio Janus | Apr 04, 2019 | 12:00 Share Tweet Send Share Bitcoin price breaking $5,000 has everyone and their mum scrambling around to work out what might have caused it. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the key contenders (Brexit included), before settling this once and for all.Because\u2026 April Fools Joke?One of the first suggestions to hit crypto-Twitter can be blamed on the breakout\u2019s unfortunate timing. Yep, Bloomberg and The Telegraph even went as far as reporting that the whole thing could be down to an April Fools joke. The joke in question? A spoof article on Finance Magnates, claiming that the SEC had approved two Bitcoin ETFs in an emergency Sunday night meeting.There are two problems with the theory: Firstly, Finance Magnates. Fair play to FM for the gag (it was certainly one of the most creative in the crypto-space this year). However, the idea that the whole crypto-verse read that article, and despite nobody else reporting the story, decided to buy, buy, buy\u2026 Nah.Secondly, it didn\u2019t actually happen on April 1st; or at least not before midday, wherever in the world you are. By that time the article had been updated to include very obvious [April Fools] spoilers.Because\u2026 Brexit?Now, we\u2019re being led to believe that Brexit might be to blame\u2026 bless the Dutch. The idea behind this theory is that, due to the uncertainty over Brexit, Brits are following the example of Venezuela and going all in on Bitcoin.Plausible? Of course not; whilst the fate of the UK (and the pound) is uncertain, it isn\u2019t in the same league as some South American economies. And of course, there\u2019s an easy way to check; as the UK (and only the UK), uses pounds sterling, we can see if the flow of pounds into bitcoin is even visible on this chart. [spoiler alert: it isn\u2019t]Because\u2026 We Aren\u2019t Really SureThe consensus is that nobody really knows. Even Binance CEO CZ admitted he is \u201chonestly clueless.\u201danyone know any news? I have been asked \"a few\" times, but honestly clueless.\u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) April 2, 2019The consensus, of course, is wrong. I have privately suggested that the start of the thaw occurred when I said it did, and this latest spike is just an acceleration of that. But that was based on 15-month highs in volume, and we all know we can\u2019t trust volume anymore.The Real ReasonIn truth, Samson Mow came closest, with his tongue-in-cheek tweet that the price spike \u201cwas caused by more people buying and holding.\u201dSo if you want a definitive answer, here it is. The bitcoin price broke out because there wasn\u2019t enough supply to meet the demand at a lower price. In fact, considerable support built up at sub-$4k price levels. Then, as price broke through key resistance, demand increased further (possibly through a little FOMO), and there still wasn\u2019t enough supply to fulfill what turned into panic buying.Is that enough to break the bear market. We\u2019ll have to wait and see. But that\u2019s why the price went up\u2026 and if you were expecting something more than that, you probably believed that it was the April Fools joke.What caused the bitcoin price to surge this past week?

Thus, leading financial specialists and investors are now interested in finding out whether there is an intersection between the mounting global debt and the recent spike in BTC price 00.Robert Burgess, a former global editor in charge of financial markets for Bloomberg, writes about the implications of the $3.3 trillion added to the total global debt, and highlights in this context,The pessimism about stocks and spiking Bitcoin fever.4 Reasons Explaining Bitcoin\u2019s Recent Surge in ValueBurgess underlines that although stock prices have increased slightly, they have remained mostly flat since early 2018. And, in contrast, he remarks on the optimistic views that are starting to prevail among cryptocurrency enthusiasts following bitcoin\u2019s price surge of 23 percent to smash through the $5,000 mark. He writes,As if on cue, crypto promoters were predicting even more gains, with one saying Bitcoin will surely reach $7,000 in short order.Burgess admits that nobody knows for sure what is propelling and sustaining bitcoin\u2019s price surge to over $5,000. However, in this regard, Richardson GMP, one of Canada\u2019s leading management firms, has suggested the following factors:1) A short covering/squeeze that was triggered when Bitcoin recently moved above $4,000; 2) A blockchain conference in Seoul; 3) An exchange of pounds for Bitcoin by British citizens in case Brexit goes horribly wrong; 4) An April Fools\u2019 Day story on an obscure crypto website claiming the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.However, regardless of the ballooning global debt or any other reason causing Bitcoin\u2019s positive price movements, the latest rally shows evidence that big money is starting to jump onto the Bitcoin bandwagon. As Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors recently put it,Bitcoin had a rough 2018, and for much of 2019, it has been steadily climbing and from what we can gather, it is because there are a lot of positive things taking place.

Stocks linked to cryptocurrencies in both Asia and the US have marked notable gains during the same period, according to Bloomberg.

Chinese Yuan Again Flowing Into BitcoinThe latest data from Coinmarketcap shows trading volume involving USDT comprising around $18 billion. The stable coin currently stands at a market capitalization of roughly $2.11 billion.This is up from its yearly low of $1.6 billion seen in mid-November when USDT dropped under its nominal peg to 98 cents. Notably, this was also when Bitcoin\u2019s $6,000 support finally gave, plunging BTC/USD to $3,000 price levels.Bitcoinist reported in March on the resurgence of Chinese Yuan (CNY) inflows into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. The likey reason for this resurgence is record profits from red-hot Chinese stocks.Data from Coinlib shows $127 million and $72.4 million in CNY money flows over the past 24 hours into bitcoin and ethereum, respectively.This may not be a coincidence as bitcoin price 00 surged over 27 percent over the past week breaking some key resistance levels along the way. The latest upswing is also seeing increasing bullish sentiment that could be signalling a reversal after a 15-month long bear market.Chinese Shrug Off Bitcoin Trading BanChinese traders and investors appear to be shrugging off the current ban on ICOs and virtual currency trading. Appetite for bitcoin in China appears to be on the rise once more as off-exchange and OTC platforms are becoming more popular.The rising bitcoin price, meanwhile, seems to be activating a positive feedback loop that\u2019s boosting interest in the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency.Bitcoin exchanges frequented by Chinese traders such as Huobi and OkEx have been seeing increasing traffic, according to the latest data from Alexa Rankings.Additionally, a December 2018 survey of nearly 5000 Chinese people revealed that two in five (or 40 percent) wanted to invest in bitcoin, particularly among the millenial demographic.Futhermore, searches on China\u2019s \u2018Google\u2019 Baidu for Bitcoin have soared over the past week to the number one spot on April 4th as BTC price hit its 2019 high.Due to the recent price surge, #bitcoin tops today's Baidu hottest emerging keywords.

In total, 26.4 billion sovereign bolivars (VES) went through the platform.While not a record in Bitcoin terms, as Bitcoinist continues to report, the volatility of the Venezuelan currency due to the country\u2019s precarious politicial and economic situation has led citizens to cryptocurrency in droves. While previously little noticed, the phenomenon has now begun entering the mainstream media, with users going on record to reiterate their faith in the borderless alternative to the VES or the Petro, the Venezuelan government\u2019s highly-controversial state-backed virtual currency.\u201cMany Venezuelans are using Bitcoin to convert their bolivars, which are being permanently devalued by hyperinflation, to keep something of value,\u201d a Caracas-based consultant told BBC News last month.Eduardo G\u00f3mez, head of support at Bitcoin marketplace Purse.io and himself a Venezuelan national, meanwhile included Localbitcoins as one of the few companies which have \u201csaved his life on multiple occasions\u201d in a tweet Monday.Worldwide Localbitcoins SurgeEconomic woes are not confined to Venezuela, with Argentina and Colombia likewise seeing increased Bitcoin interest as its own difficulties persist.Last week, just after investor and Bitcoin bull Tim Draper met the country\u2019s president and even made a Bitcoin bet with him, ordinary Argentinians put more pesos through Localbitcoins than ever before \u2013 in total, 10.7 million ARS ($243,000).Elsewhere, while not hitting all-time highs, usage was noticeably up in countries including Peru, Chile and Mexico. A more unexpected result came in from across the world in Kazakhstan meanwhile, where Localbitcoins had its most successful week ever.

The number of google searches for Bitcoin is skyrocketing again as well, especially in these five countries.1. NigeriaAny glance at Local Bitcoins trends around the world will quickly show you that BTC has a perfect use case in countries with galloping inflation and dubious governments. Venezuela, Turkey, Kenya, and Nigeria have all started to become aware of ways to shield their wealth from devaluation by buying Bitcoin.It may be volatile, but even a drop of over 80 percent in a year is nothing compared to Venezuela\u2019s 95 percent in 24 hours or Nigeria\u2019s unpredictable sudden drops.It\u2019s also relatively easy to pay for things in Bitcoin in Nigeria with plenty of options for its citizens including traditional e-commerce chains. Finally, the Blockchain Conference Nigeria in Lagos on April 5 could have bumped up those searches, too. Then again, it could just be the fact that savvy Nigerians are gearing up for the next bull-run.2. NetherlandsThe Dutch are getting seriously interested in Bitcoin again. Second on the list with a population of only 17 million.Why are google searches for bitcoin leaping up like crazy here? One possible factor could be that the scene is growing in the Netherlands. There are countless events and meetups scheduled about blockchain for developers, investors, and the general public alike.Brock Pierce was all over the news for buying a $1.2 million mansion in Amsterdam in bitcoin.There is also the European Payments Summit coming up later this month and TNW\u2019s mega tech conference in May with the Hard Fork blockchain track. The rising BTC price? Well, that may have something to do with it as well.3. South AfricaSouth Africa is leading the way in Bitcoin usage, the world number one with some 10 percent of its population owning cryptocurrency of some kind. Citizens here have found buying Bitcoin a practical way of sending money abroad and receiving remittances with reduced fees. With little regulation in the country on cryptocurrency, they are also seeing it as an attractive investment vehicle. This could explain the rise in Google searches for bitcoin.However, as the Crypto Assets Group formed by the SARB aims to implement stricter KYC/AML requirements this month, perhaps its citizens are also searching to find out the fate of bitcoin in their land.4. AustriaWith the Austria Blockchain Summit in full swing last week attracting speakers, investors, and delegates from around the world, the conference put Vienna on the map. A large event on blockchain often has an effect on general interest, and often the price, of Bitcoin. In Austria, it seems to have done both.It will be interesting to see where France comes on the list of google searches for bitcoin next week as the Paris Blockchain Week kicks off.5. SwitzerlandIt\u2019s pretty safe to say that most people in Switzerland are not using Bitcoin as a form of hedging against an unstable currency. The Swiss franc is one of the most stable fiat currencies in the world.Therefore, it\u2019s more likely that the Crypto friendly land and home to Xapo, the biggest Bitcoin custodian, is starting to buy the Bitcoin momentum. Already the general public is pretty well educated on Bitcoin here. You can buy BTC at every train station.

There are numerous great solutions in each of those areas but they don\u2019t interact much. That is why we decided to bring the best in all those worlds together in a single product. Having smart contracts underpinning our ecosystem, we guarantee transparence, provable fairness, and full independence. With tokens and a dividend system in place, we get a powerful decentralized financial system that generates profits,\u201d Xether CEO Alexei Mischenko says.Provable fairness means that nobody has the means to meddle in the outcome of games. The outcome itself can be independently audited at any time.\u201cMost gambling projects don\u2019t show their real balance, so nobody can be sure whether they get their win in the end. Others may have withdrawal limitations in place. All calculations and results are generated on a centralized server that conceals all those processes making them non-auditable. We allow one to play without registration, don\u2019t require any deposits and purchases, and settle everything through a smart contract. The payouts are also a part of the smart contract,\u201d Mr. Mischenko adds.In order to play, a user only has to have some ETH on their wallet. For now, the casino offers games like pyramid, coin toss, dice, roulette, and slot simulator. The developers say that they plan to add poker and sports betting in the future as well.\u201cWe also have plans to engage with other smart contract platforms. The main thing is that they have to share our principles of transparency and openness,\u201d Mr. Mischenko says.Xether also allows one to purchase casino tokens granting their owner a passive income. It comes from dividends on the token turnover and the casino fee applied to wins. Once a certain amount of fees is accumulated, the game\u2019s smart contract sends them to the core smart contract that distributes them between token holders proportionally to their share. The tokens are generated upon purchase and destroyed upon sale. The company\u2019s spokesperson stresses that they give a share in the casino\u2019s profits but are not required in order to play.What do you think? Let us know in the comments below!"}

To deal with such uncertainties, many are flocking towards Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.Commenting on the matter, Kling opined:It\u2019s [Bitcoin] become a hedge against irresponsible monetary and fiscal policy. We had the Fed do a complete U-turn into dovish mode, then everyone else followed (European Central Bank and Bank of Japan). We now have this set up where they [central banks] have become politicized both in the U.S. and globally. It\u2019s the new world we are living in.Kling\u2019s talk of politicized central banking can be observed in the Fed\u2019s decision to go into permanent quantitative easing (QE) in 2019. Many analysts attributed this move to political pressure from the White House.For Kling, that decision highlights the original appeal of Bitcoin \u2013 an alternative currency based on decentralized technology that\u2019s free from government meddling.Kling adds that Trump\u2019s influence on Fed policy is \u201cSo bullish\u201d for cryptocurrencies.\u2026Look at whats happening with monetary/fiscal policies. And US policy isnt nearly as rekt as EU, Japan & China Close your eyes & imagine the next 5-10 years. Do you really think these policy \u2018experiments\u2019 are going to end well?The Fed Always Stacks the DeckThe combination of QE \u2013 a euphemism for \u2018money printing\u2019 and fiscal deficits means that the burden of negative interest rates will most likely be transferred to consumer bank accounts.According to the Ikigai fund manager, the Fed always has the deck stacked, saying:You\u2019ll never win betting against the Fed.In a previously published interview with Bitcoinist, Max Keiser comes to a similar conclusion, saying:The trend in Bitcoin\u2019s price flipped from bear to bull once the Fed said it would ease-off tightening and engage in permanent money printing (\u2018permanent QE\u2019). This is wealth confiscation by the bank cartels to keep their insolvent balance sheets from imploding. The impact on Bitcoin and Gold will be moving to new ATH as safe-haven money pours in.To avoid the negative impact of negative rates and debt-monetization, the likes of Keiser and Kling say people are moving their wealth into Bitcoin. This trend could contribute to Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high.Do you agree that Bitcoin can be a hedge against flawed central bank policy?

The above quote comes from a brand new report from the legendary investor/philanthropist Ray Dalio.In the report titled Why and How Capitalism Needs to be Reformed, Dalio, similar to Marks, blames a polarised political climate where the gap between capitalists and socialists is increasing rapidly.Unlike Marks, however, Dalio takes it one step further and traces the root of the issues to a failing education system.In his view, funds are increasingly being siphoned from the have-nots to benefit the haves, the deteriorating education among the former is directly responsible for everything from the widening wealth gap to incarceration levels, to emotional and health issues and of course, the political divide.In Dalio\u2019s words, this self-reinforcing feedback loop has come \u201cto the point that capitalism and the American Dream are in Jeopardy.\u201dWe can fix it though. In his report, Dalio talks about impact investing in the education sector as the solution to fixing this problem.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystDue to local elections, there will be no daily market update tomorrow.

There doesn\u2019t seem to be any significant news item driving it, but there\u2019s clearly a touch of \u2018risk off\u2019 sentiment in the markets.Economic news is light today and tomorrow, as we await the ECB announcement on Wednesday. The jobs data that came out on Friday was taken very well by the market as the number of jobs in the US grew more than expected but wage gain was more tepid then normal.That last figure seems to reinforce the Fed\u2019s policy of patience and we can probably expect them to make good on their forecast for no rate rises this year.The lack of sentiment and lack of direction is evident in the stocks and the US Dollar.Safety PlaysThough things are stable in the stocks and among the major currencies, we can see movement in the commodities and bonds.Crude oil rose into the weekend and is now holding its higher levels, while gold seems to be rising off its recent lows this morning.It seems that as the central banks continue to provide more and more liquidity, some of them are seeking hard assets to back up their reserves. This report shows how China has been increasing its gold holdings steadily over the last few months.Testing CryptoVolumes have come down a bit from last week\u2019s surge but are still about double what they were last month.

With many calling an end of the bear market, we take a looking at the outlook for the market going into the second week of April.Weekly ChartThe weekly bitcoin price 00 chart shows that BTC/USD completed an impressive seventh consecutive weekly green candle, accompanied by the highest volume of 2019.The MACD remains crossed bullish and is rapidly moving towards being positive, having been bearish since mid-May 2018.There is still a void in VPVR, which illustrates the price where volume traded. This suggests that Bitcoin still has some room to run higher, which is something we have previously discussed with the $5k price range being open ground.The 50-week moving average capped the initial attempt to break out of the bull market in mid-2015 before pressing price back down to the 200 week moving average support. There is certainly a case for expecting something similar in 2019.Should this occur, the 200 WMA would most likely lie around $3800. This would mean a 78.6% retracement of the move we\u2019ve seen in 2019. But a move like this would likely take some time to play out.Daily ChartLooking at the daily chart early on Monday, bitcoin price made an attempt to break higher, which has since been pushed back down into a bearish shooting star candle, which is in the process of forming on the daily candle. There is however, plenty of time for the bulls to find their feet with the US markets yet to open.The MACD continues to trend higher above zero, but there are signs of the bullish momentum fading, with a lower high being printed on the histogram. Volume is beginning to return to levels seen ahead of the breakout. Price appreciation on decreasing volume is generally considered a bearish sign.Should BTC/USD look to retrace in the short term, the 50% Fibonacci level of $4355 would most likely be the area of interest for the bulls, with the breakout level and 61.8% retracement of $4120 being the next target.1-Hour Order Book AnalysisLooking at the order book, bitcoin has a block of buying interest around the $4800 price point. And on lower time frames, we can see that there is still a generally bullish ascending triangle pattern in the price action, which is positive ahead of the US close with a lack of sizable sell orders visible overhead. Looking AheadDespite the selloff on Monday morning, bitcoin price has managed to maintain above $5100.Holding ground above the $5,100 handle early in the week will be key to continuing bullish momentum and any attempt to explore the remaining price volume void in the VPVR.Although it seems unlikely at this stage, a break to the upside could see BTC quickly push on towards the $5500 \u2013 $5700 price range, enticing new buyers into the market.A breakdown in price momentum would bring those who have already taken profit back into the market, alongside new prospective buyers. So it would be reasonable to expect a decent bounce back up to the $5,000 level quite quickly.Trade Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

In January, the World Gold Council reported that Bitcoin is \u201cno substitute for gold.\u201dCan Bitcoin Really Replace Gold?Irrespective of the debate, flat facts have it that Bitcoin does have the properties needed to be a better store of value than gold. In January, for example, the Bank of England denied incumbent president Nicolas Maduro from accessing Venezuela\u2019s gold reserves, worth \u00a31.2 billion.Long-term Bitcoin advocate, Max Keiser, commented on the matter, outlining the obvious:Bitcoin is Unconfiscatable.Moreover, Bitcoin is also politically neutral. In the case of Venezuela, the funds could have been secured by nothing more than a simple passphrase, rather than having to trust a foreign bank.Another example comes from Italy, where major political parties have proposed a bill which, if passed, would declare the Italian people to be the owners of the gold reserves of the Bank of Italy.Reportedly, anti-establishment and nationalist politicians in the country have repeatedly bashed the country\u2019s central bank, as well as other private banks for failing to prevent the banking crises, hence causing many small individual investors to lose billions of dollars.If you are here with your current account in the red, it\u2019s because the people who were supposed to control things didn\u2019t do so. \u2013 said Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, also leader of League.Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature means that no central authority can set its monetary policy, making it the world\u2019s first politically-nuetral network for transferring value. In other words, Bitcoin could do to money what the internet did to information.When we put all of the above together, it doesn\u2019t come much as a surprise that many are predicting that it will become more popular than gold as the go-to store of value in the digital age.Do you think Bitcoin will become gold 2.0?

While Lightning itself has only existed on the Bitcoin mainnet for around 15 months, the Torch has demonstrated the network\u2019s resilience, with various high-profile figures becoming involved.The relay works by nodes on the network accepting, adding the Torch transaction and adding a nominal amount of bitcoin, currently 10,000 satoshis, before passing it forward. So far, the Torch has had around 275 owners, with Ryyti opting to hand it to Colombian Bitcoin guru BTC Andres. In total, there will only be enough ownership spots for the sum of the transaction to reach 5 million satoshis.It has been exciting to #hodl the LN torch! I posted about this on my IG account & will be donating 10K sats to the first 21 of my followers who manages to send me an invoice!

On social media, the model gained considerable acclaim, despite a conspicuous lack of feedback from non-crypto followers from Instagram. The event is not the first time the Torch has ventured outside of crypto, with perhaps its other outing also becoming its best-known when Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey took over in February.As Bitcoinist reported, his custody was more than a token gesture, Dorsey subsequently pledging to integrate Lightning in both Twitter and his payments startup Square. The latter is currently hiring developers for its dedicated venture, dubbed Square Crypto. BTC Andres meanwhile held the Torch for only a short time before passing it elsewhere among the South American Bitcoin community. Currently, the invoice lies with DJ Booth, creator of Lightning-enabled Bitcoin crowdfunding platform Tallycoin, where Torch creator Hodlonaut is currently raising funds for the plight of Venezuelans.According to monitoring resource 1ML.com, Bitcoin mainnet Lightning currently has 7876 nodes, over 39,000 channels and a total capacity of 1080 BTC. The figures represent monthly growth of 9.8 percent, 14.7 percent, and 40 percent, respectively.

And, it highlighted the effect of the advent of the Lightning Network in the upgrade, as follows,Bitcoin has been upgraded with the roll-out of its Lightning Network and is the best positioned to become a popular store of value for savers and investors.The Lightning Network is a decentralized system where participants can implement trustless micropayment channels to perform one or multiple payment transactions off-blockchain.These channels reside off the Bitcoin blockchain. Transactions occur between these channels. Upon completion, transactions are transmitted, as a single transaction, to the blockchain. Then, the payment channel is closed, and transactions are transcribed onto the blockchain.Therefore, regardless of the number of transactions performed, the BTC blockchain is accessed twice, at the opening of the channel and the closing of the channel.The implementation of Lightning Network nodes continues to gain momentum. As of this writing, according to 1ML, a Lightning Network monitoring website, the network now boasts 7,744 nodes and 39,129 channels. And the network capacity reaches over 1,059 BTC.Will Bitcoin ATMs use Lightning Network to cut costs in the future?

Gox hack, his lawyer spoke out. He claims the police purely hoped to extract a confession, and the prosecution objected to evidence of Alexander Vinnik\u2019s involvement.Mt. Gox Ex-CEO Got A Pretty Raw DealIt\u2019s safe to say Mark Karpel\u00e8s has had a pretty awful time over the past five years. The former CEO of the former largest Bitcoin exchange in the world has really been through the wringer. Following the 2014 hack of the Mt. Gox exchange, he cooperated with all law enforcement agencies but has faced suspicion at every turn.Last month he was acquitted of embezzlement charges relating to the heist but received a suspended sentence for data manipulation. In Japan, the odds of a partial not-guilty verdict following an indictment are less than one percent. According to his lawyer, Nobuyasu Ogata:Imagine someone stole everything in your store and you reported the crime to the police. A year later, the police suddenly arrest you for breach of trust, don\u2019t recover the stolen merchandise and let the criminal go free. That\u2019s essentially what happened with Mt. Gox.Interrogated 8 Hours Per Day About Missing BitcoinAfter being arrested on unconnected charges in August 2015, Karpel\u00e8s spent 11 months in jail. He says he was \u201cinterrogated for eight hours each day. I was asked about the missing bitcoins. I was even asked if I was Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin.\u201dIf the police were looking for a confession as Ogata contends, they didn\u2019t get it. Karpel\u00e8s was released on bail.Meanwhile, US Authorities were also looking into the case although their preferred method was to track the lost bitcoin. An IRS led task-force concluded that it was an outsider who had hacked Mt. Gox, and not the inside job which many suspected. What\u2019s more, the bulk of the 600,000 BTC stolen between 2011 and 2013 led straight to one man \u2013 Alexander Vinnik.This Vinnik Is A Popular Guy, Right?Greek authorities arrested Russian national and former BTC-e operator, Vinnik, in July 2017, on suspicion of money laundering, and links to Mt. Gox and several other hacks. While awaiting extradition to either Russia, France, or the US, Greek authorities foiled an assassination attempt. Greece handed him over to Russia in September last year, although he may now be passed on to the French authorities.When Ogata tried to enter Vinnik\u2019s indictment and the \u2018outside job\u2019 conclusion of the US team as evidence in Karpel\u00e8s trial, the prosecution objected. The Russian should be presumed innocent until proven guilty, they claimed. Whereas Karpel\u00e8s on the other hand\u2026The panel of judges referred to Vinnik\u2019s indictment in their ruling. Perhaps if the prosecution had accepted the findings of the US task force back in 2017 when they were first presented, the Karpel\u00e8s trial wouldn\u2019t have had to happen at all.Was BTC-e operator Alexander Vinnik the Mt.

In this way, it will be very fast and energy efficient.Providing Both Privacy and Regulatory Compliance?The press release also notes that Usechain is apparently quite useful for law enforcement, as the network \u201ccan use multiple signature to have access to the ID information\u201d of someone who uses the blockchain to evade taxes, fund terrorists, or launder money.

As Bitcoinist reported, concerns had lingered that a failure to close out March above $3800 would result in a fresh bearish move for the Bitcoin price. Now, however, it would appear support remains firmly in place for BTC/USD, which has managed to stay above $4000 since March 29. Predictably, Bitcoin advocates from trading circles were buoyed by the latest price action, entrepreneur Alistair Milne summarizing the mood on social media. \u201cPretty much every OG Bitcoin trader I respect is now leaning bullish,\u201d he wrote Sunday. Hopes Run High In 2nd Bull WeekBitcoin price has long caused a headache for traders and investors alike after halving from $6500 to a low of $3100 last November. Part of what many see as a necessary bear market retraction from all-time highs of $20,000 in December 2017, the pace of price decreases has since slowed. This in turn has led to concerns that the current bullish trend is a red herring, and that further losses are even essential to decisively end the Bitcoin bear market.That theory has nonetheless failed to dent the enthusiasm of many well-known industry figures. As Bitcoinist variously noted, crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, serial investor Tim Draper and others remain highly confident about Bitcoin price potential by 2020. Estimates for year end vary, with a separate trend also emerging around the May 2020 Bitcoin block reward halving event. According to calculations from venture capital firm Pantera Capital released last week, the impact of block halving may begin to appear on the market as soon as June this year. \u201cAlthough there\u2019s only a few data points, it seems that Bitcoin\u2019s price has shown patterns with block reward halvings,\u201d a summary post read following near-completion of Pantera\u2019s third VC fund. We have seen a couple of these cycles where the tide begins to shift roughly a year in advance of these dates. Inflection points occurred 376 and 320 days prior to the 2012 and 2016 \u2018halvings\u2019, respectively. Taking their average of 348 days could indicate a bottom on June 10, 2019.What do you think about the Bitcoin price?

Despite the assumption that token-holders would participate purely through the passive incentive of ownership, most prefer more tangible benefits. Off-Chain Vs. On-Chain GovernanceWho governs Bitcoin? While nobody owns the network, somebody must be in charge of parameters such as block size and adding capabilities like SegWit. In truth, Bitcoin governance occurs off-chain. Any proposal for the protocol must be formalised, tested and discussed among the users, until it gains a significant majority support. Once accepted, node operators update their software to include the new proposal.In contrast, on-chain governance gives token holders the chance to directly affect the protocol, with on-chain voting on major decisions. But do such mechanisms give a truly democratic outcome, and do the majority of token holders even care?Encouraging Token-Holders To VoteVoter turnout on such proposals is a very rough guide to community participation. When looking at several recent votes, the investigation notes that there is a large disparity between projects.Many projects struggle to get voter turnout of even 10%. This becomes an even bigger problem when considering wallet address participation as opposed to circulating supply.For example, the Aragon AGP-5 proposal attracted voters controlling 9.30% of the circulating supply. However, in terms of participating wallet addresses, this accounted for just 0.12% (25 wallets out of over 20,000). This only goes to strengthen the case against on-chain voting as leading to plutocracy.The standouts against this trend of voter apathy seem to be Decred, Cosmos, and Tezos. In fact, accounting for abstentions (such as that of the Tezos foundation), these projects have voter turnouts which put US elections to shame. So how do they do it?Self-Identity And IncentivisationFirstly, it is important to note that all three of these protocols actively \u2018identify\u2019 as self-governing blockchains. It could be that this element of the projects is one of the key draws which appealed to many of the token-holders.Additionally, and perhaps a greater factor, is that Decred, Cosmos, and Tezos, all provide voters with direct incentives to participate via Proof-of-Stake. So the assumption that token holders will participate in on-chain governance votes purely through their passive ownership seems flawed.There are many reasons why a stakeholder may choose not to vote; from complicated polling procedure, to lack of strong opinion or expertise on the matter in hand. Or they simply speculate on coin price and couldn\u2019t care less about its development and future.But when faced with a tangible incentive, more stakeholders appear to have a compelling reason to vote.Will on-chain governance models improve and incentivize users to vote?

This has halted Bitcoin\u2019s valuation at $20k and even driven the price down below $15k!\u201d he wrote in a circular to the Bitcoin Core mailing list. However, clearly Bitcoin is worth much more than that, and there is widespread support for higher prices. In light of this, I have written and implemented two BIPs: one to add a signed price field to Bitcoin transactions, and the other to softfork a minimum price of $50k USD/BTC a year from today.The low #Bitcoin prices have gone on too long.\"Softfork proposal for minimum price of $50k USD/BTC\"https://t.co/Si48prViUK\u2014 Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) April 1, 2019The news will no doubt delight the increasing numbers of Bitcoin holders who have chosen to accumulate and \u2018HODL\u2019 through the cryptocurrency\u2019s longest-ever bear market. Despite Bitcoin price hitting $4000 from 19-month lows of $3100 last month, sentiment remains divided over its short-term future. As Bitcoinist reported, some figures remain confident that Bitcoin dropping below $3000 is unlikely, while others are more cautious, arguing the bear market will only definitively reverse when BTC/USD falls closer to $1000. A change in code, Luke-jr argues, would remove such uncertainty and headaches for dedicated investors.\u201cThis problem can be fixed by setting a global minimum price for bitcoins,\u201d he continued. Unfortunately, today, the consensus protocol is completely oblivious to the price bitcoins are traded at. Therefore, we must first add a field to Bitcoin transactions to indicate their price.Moon Coded In Stone?The developer was not alone in his concerted celebration of April 1.BREAKING: F2Pool opens office in Pyongyang, targeting the Korean market https://t.co/EH0UhFHOlv\u2014 wangchun @ bitfish+f2pool (@satofishi) April 1, 2019Across the industry, businesses and users alike were contributing to the unlikely flow of breaking news, which has included Blockstream supporting Ethereum and Satoshi Nakamoto returning to Bitcointalk to confirm he is not Craig Wright.

As Bitcoinist reported, momentum is building around a theory that the Bitcoin block reward halving, set for May that year, will begin to push up the Bitcoin price a year in advance.

The move is part of efforts to upgrade Kiev\u2019s public transport infrastructure to meet up with the standards seen in other major cities across the globe.Accepting Bitcoin on Kiev\u2019s Public Transport SystemAccording to iaftnews, the KCSA is going back to its previous plan of adopting BTC payment in the city\u2019s public transportation network. Inside sources with knowledge of plan revealed:The question has already been raised in 2018, but this idea had to be temporarily abandoned, given the cost of bitcoin at that time. Now, as you know, bitcoin has fallen heavily in price, which opens up new opportunities.Back in August 2018, reports emerged that the KCSA planned to launch BTC payments for bus fares within the city. However, the plan failed to materialize but it appears that the city is trying a second time to implement the process.The introduction of BTC payments in Kiev\u2019s public transport system is part of the city\u2019s drive to revamp its public transportation sector. In February 2019, the Kyiv Smart Cards \u2013 a prepaid card that provides access to all forms of public transport in the city went on sale.Bitcoin as Part of Vision 2024Kiev plans to make its entire public transport system utilizing only e-ticketing infrastructure by 2024. Like Dubai\u2019s NOL card and Argentina\u2019s SUBE travelcard, the Kyiv Smart Card can be used on the subway, buses, trams, route taxi, electric trains, etc.Mega cities around the world are pivoting towards the system as a way of simplifying the process of commuting within a metropolis for locals and tourists alike. As reported by Bitcoinist, cities in Argentina already allow Bitcoin as a means of payment for topping up the credit balance on SUBE travelcards.For KCSA officials, the hope is that the developments in e-ticketing made thus far will aid the BTC adoption process. There are also future plans to introduce a single Bitcoin ticket for all modes of public transportation in Kiev.If approved, the move will significantly enhance the reputation of BTC and cryptocurrencies in Ukraine. In mid-2018, Ukraine\u2019s securities chairman called for the legalization of many cryptocurrencies, saying the world has crossed the \u201cpoint of no return\u201d as concerning cryptos.Do you think that Bitcoin is an efficient payment method for municipal public transportation system?

US Congress just introduced two new cryptocurrency bills aimed to address price manipulation and boost the country\u2019s competitive edge in the new industry. Bill H.R. 922 \u2013 Handling Price ManipulationRepresentatives Darren Soto and Warren Davidson have introduced two new blockchain-related bills on January 30th.The first one called H.R. 922 \u2013 Virtual Currency Consumer Protection Act of 2019, is aimed at tackling the issue of price manipulation.According to the document, the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will be required to submit a report, which details the potential for virtual currency price manipulation, including methods, susceptible classes, effects and harm to investors, and so forth.Moreover, the document also puts a definition for the term \u201cvirtual currency\u201d as a:digital representation of value that does not have legal tender status and that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value.Bill H.R. 923 \u2013 Increasing CompetitivenessThe other bill is called H.R 923. \u2013 U.S. Virtual Currency Market and Regulatory Competitiveness Act of 2019. If passed, it would require another report from the Chairman of the CFTC, in consultation with SEC heads, as well as other relevant federal agencies deemed necessary, detailing the means to promote the country\u2019s competitiveness in the field.This report would include comparative studies on existing US and international legislation, evaluation of the benefits of virtual currency, as well as blockchain technology to the US commodities market, legislative proposals, recommendations, and so forth.H.R. 923 also requires the regulators to propose a new regulatory structure for cryptocurrency exchanges, which would include consumer protections, federal licensure, and market supervision.Legislative ContinuityIt\u2019s worth noting that the above two bills come after the introduction of the Token Taxonomy Act. As Bitcoinist reported, the bill proposes that cryptocurrencies should be exempt from being classified as securities and, hence, securities law will no longer apply to them once their projects become fully functioning networks.Bill H.R. 922\u2019s definition for virtual currencies closely follows that proposed in the Token Taxonomy Act, which could indicate a potential attempt on behalf of Congress to determine a definition for the term for future regulations.In late 2018, the SEC\u2019s Chairman, Jay Clayton, said that the lack of safeguards, as well as the \u201csignificant risk of manipulation\u201d are essentially roadblocking a Bitcoin ETF approval. Given that H.R. 922\u2019s primary aim is to identify methods of tackling issues of the kind, it could facilitate the approval of a Bitcoin ETF.Of course, it\u2019s also important to note that there is a long way for these bills to become acting laws. It would first have to pass subcommittee actions and passed by the House of Representatives. Then it would need to go through the Senate, and then signed by the President.What do you think of the new proposed bills on cryptocurrencies?

Anybody\u2019s guess at the moment.Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Exchange, however, said:\u201cBitcoin has rocketed higher, to clear some major levels, breaking back above a consolidation high from back in December, to suggest it could be thinking about turning back up again in a more meaningful way,\u201d said Kruger, who also noted that central banks may be responsible for dollar\u2019s inflationary achilles heel against deflationary Bitcoin.At a time when central banks have exhausted themselves with the unprecedented printing of money to keep sentiment running high and the global economy afloat, over a decade after the crisis of 2008, it would seem a peer-to-peer decentralized currency, with limited supply and an attractive technology that it rests on, could be a compelling alternative option.Simple Technical Analysis At WorkIn reality, there may be no guesswork needed.Bitcoin price has been in the throes of a rising wedge for months, which some would say is a bullish pattern per classical technical analysis theory. Upon breaking out of the said wedge, a massive pump was to be expected.\u201cBitcoin\u2019s break above $4,200 this morning was critical, as the market had been watching that level for a while,\u201d eToro\u2019s Mati Greenspan correctly told CNBC, continuing: \u201cNo doubt some entry orders and stop losses were grouped right above.\u201dThe analyst also noted that shorts on Bitfinex, one of the biggest bitcoin exchanges by volume, are at monthly lows, suggesting that traders may be gearing up for a prolonged rally.\u201cBitcoin shorts\u2026near their lowest levels since February,\u201d he said.So no, it doesn\u2019t seem like too many people are selling the pop.Bitcoin shorts @bitfinex (blue line) near their lowest levels since February.

This trigger was through volume-led price action driving the price and triggering algos on a breakout.Bullish sentiment is also palpable on Bitmex, one of the largest Bitcoin margin trading platforms in the world. Longs to Shorts ratio currently leans toward the bulls at 62 to 38 percent, respectively.Why do you think the price of Bitcoin (BTC) broke out this morning?

All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsAfter a strong close to Q1, the stock markets are getting off to an excellent start for Q2. The Asian session was phenomenal after some better than expected manufacturing numbers out of China. The Europeans have taken a strong handover and are currently making the most of it.Here are three of the major stock indices. Check out that massive gap up over the weekend and continuation this morning.Some critical news will come out of the USA later today.

The big headline comes this morning after yesterday\u2019s elections\u2026As you can see, Erdogan\u2019s party has lost the capital of Ankara. As we write, votes are still being counted in Istanbul.These surprise results are putting some pressure on the Lira today. Still, if we zoom out a bit we can see that the USDTRY is still relatively stable, especially if we consider the meltdown last August. For now, it remains pretty close to the 200 day moving average (blue line).Crypto testingAs we mentioned above, the crypto markets are rather perky this morning. Most of the top cryptos by market cap are up around 1% over the last 24 hours. Of course, since it\u2019s altseason we do have a few that are outperforming.Most notable is Dash, which has risen a total of 11.23%. Thanks in large part to the weekend ramp.

Let\u2019s take a look at the charts to determine what could be expected for the number one crypto asset in the near future. Bitcoin Price: Daily ChartThe Daily Chart for Bitcoin price paints an overall positive picture for the bulls. The previous week\u2019s bear blockade at $4050, which was the task at hand for the bulls, was ultimately overcome last Friday.Bulls weren\u2019t the fools on this April 1st as BTC hit a new yearly high at $4138.The $4050 level itself has already been tested on Saturday and also in the early hours prior to the run up to the high \u2013 these are encouraging signs of prior resistance now becoming support.The volume profile shown down the right hand side of the chart illustrates that the Point of Control in terms of price where volume is traded remains back at $3906. This is also where the 50-day moving average is found.This is where the bulls need to step in should the bears decide to take advantage of the decreasing volume, and successfully break price down.Overall volume is still declining as price is rising, however. This is generally seen to be bearish divergence so the bulls should proceed with relative caution approaching resistance at $4250.Meanwhile, the bulls continue to consolidate in a bottoming Adam and Eve with an inverse head and shoulders pattern within Eve\u2019s Cup.Should this play out, the bulls will look to break toward the measured move targets for both, being $4800- $5000. BTC price needs to see a high volume break out to trigger this move given that the market is grinding up tentatively on low volume in a bear market.Should this pattern fail to break out, it could prove to be crushing for market sentiment and the bulls if they fail to find support at the key daily Moving Average levels. A move to the mid $2000s may then be in play.Order Book AnalysisLooking at the order book, we can see that there has been selling interest art $4250 in the same way that there was at $4050, which served to cap price.On the 4-hour timeframe, this appears to have been pulled for now, which may be a positive sign for the bulls. But it does serve as a reminder that there is selling interest above at resistance, which could not be broken back in December.Bitcoin Price: Weekly & Monthly ChartsThe monthly chart illustrates that bitcoin price has now moved from 2019 lows of $3320, closing up at $4096 \u2013 some 12% for the year, which is difficult to ignore.It also shows that BTC closed march above the December 2019 lows and has printed a second higher low on the MACD, just as the MACD is approaching zero \u2013 another positive sign.The Weekly Chart shows that bitcoin price successfully closed the week above the 20-week moving average, again being positive. It is also the closest it\u2019s been to the Bollinger bands, which are now the tightest they\u2019ve been throughout the bear market on the weekly chart, suggesting that a big move is imminent.The MACD is also into the ninth week of higher highs and is crossed bullish, but still below zero. Again, this is a positive sign.Positive Signs for a BottomIn summary, the Bitcoin and wider crypto markets are showing all the positive signs one would expect to see of a market that is trying to find a bottom and is doing so consistently.The main concern is the lack of meaningful volume and a higher high above $4250 to confirm that there is a break in the bearish trend overall.

But is this going to be 2017 all over again? No. Here are seven reasons why Bitcoin looks even better now than in 2017.Better FundamentalsFor any market to reach maturity, it must go through several bullish and bearish cycles. The latest bear market for Bitcoin has been its longest to date, but long enough to shake out the weak hands, the curious speculators, and in-and-out investors. Those who saw Bitcoin as a chance for getting rich overnight are out of the game.The key takeaway is that in spite of the bear market, Bitcoin has been building. There are now far better fundamentals in place than there were two years ago. Bitcoin usage has been steadily climbing for 15 months. Transactions, hash rate are all up despite the \u2018Crypto Winter\u2019 and 1MB+ Bitcoin block sizes are now the new normal.More Fiat On-RampsDepending on where you\u2019re based, you may have more difficulty than others getting hold of bitcoins. But despite that, there is now more fiat-on-ramps than in 2017\u2013by a long shot.That includes more exchanges appearing allowing for fiat to crypto trading, including international powerhouses like Binance and OKEx. Square\u2019s Cash App obtained the New York BitLicense in June 2018, making buying BTC through a mobile even easier than Coinbase. And there are better services from existing U.S. exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini. They now list more coins and are easier for users than before.There are also more ways to earn bitcoin and more providers who pay it. Through services like Trezor, Mycelium, Exodus, and Blockstream Green Wallet it\u2019s easier and safer to earn money in Bitcoin rather than have to purchase it from the start. Moreover, institutional investors like Bakkt will eventually settle their BTC futures contracts in bitcoins and not in cash like CME or CBOE. This means there will be more fiat money flowing into Bitcoin rather than just the futures market\u2013if it ever gets approval to officially open its doors, of course.Fewer ScamsOK, so we started the year with QuadrigaCX whose ongoing saga is still ongoing. It\u2019s not yet clear whether the owner\u2019s sudden passing with the only knowledge of the location to the cold storage wallets is true or a spectacular ruse. While we still have this slightly archaic way of storing private keys and opportune hackers exist, your funds may still be at risk. Even if you keep them yourself, you\u2019re not immune to your three-year-old picking up your Ledger and throwing it in the can. However, compared to 2017, the SEC and other regulatory bodies have done a pretty good job of weeding out scams.BitConnect, Pincoin, OneCoin, Centratech\u2026 Ponzi schemes like these, and bad actors and celebrities shilling altcoins like they\u2019re going out of style have been flushed out. People are more aware of the dangers, the importance of controlling your own private keys, and it\u2019s becoming safer to invest in Bitcoin. Proven Use-CasesBitcoin is proving its worth not just as a store of value, but also as a means of payment in many places, especially Venezuela. In countries affected by high inflation, like South Africa and Turkey, in fact, Bitcoin is proving to be a lifeline to them as well.Interesting #survey results on % of respondents owning #crypto by #Country. #SouthAfrica leading with #USA at 5.3% & #UK at 4.1%.

Bitcoin allows them to receive remittances from family members, shield their wealth from hyperinflation, and pay for essential items. Organizations like BitGive have made it easier for charities to accept BTC donations as well to make a difference in hospitals and orphanages around the country.Bitcoin is ScalingThe Lightning Network is making amazing progress, hitting already 1,000 BTC capacity (or $4.2 million). Bitcoin\u2019s layer two scaling solution looks to be unstoppable making mindblowing progress in just over a year. Once mass adoption kicks in, there won\u2019t be the bottlenecks, high fees, lengthy wait times, and collapses that we had to experience back then.More Bitcoin ATMs WorldwideThere are now way more Bitcoin ATMs around the world than there were in 2017. In fact, the number doubled last year to over 4,000 in 2018. While the latest one in Dubai made a temporary appearance due to regulation, it\u2019s a matter of time before it ticks enough boxes to come back.More Key Personalities at the TopFrom \u2018Crypto Mom\u2019 holding up the flag for Bitcoin at the SEC to U.S. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang being Bitcoin-friendly, BTC\u2019s got friends in high places. Let\u2019s also not forget that Bitcoin was officially declared not a security since the wild days of 2017.Bank scandals and unsavory behavior from centralized entities like Facebook and Google, coupled with greater growth in infrastructure have lead to more people joining in the revolution.$20,000+ is RealisticLet\u2019s not forget, Bitcoin has already hit $20,000. No one thought that was possible back then. Now, it\u2019s just another target to break just like the key psychological $1,000 level prior. That, plus all the reasons above, is why Bitcoin looks even better than in 2017. To the moon!Is Bitcoin better primed for a moon shot now than in 2017?

In a period of just one hour, Bitcoin managed to gain 22 percent, reaching a high of almost exactly $5000 before correcting. At press time, BTC/USD was hovering around $4700, but volatility remained as commentators attempted to understand the impetus behind the move and its future implications.Brief theories from the cryptocurrency industry did not initially highlight a specific factor which caused the Bitcoin price to climb half way back to its pre-November 2018 levels. At that time, as Bitcoinist reported, it was the knock-on effect of a contentious hard fork in altcoin Bitcoin Cash which sent the price tumbling from around $6500 to a low of $3130 some weeks later.Bitcoin\u2019s trip to $5k, in line with previous price moves, in turn triggered attention from mass media and mainstream consumers. Data from Google Trends shows a conspicuous increase in the desire for knowledge about both Bitcoin and the Bitcoin price as markets grew.In a further milestone, Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network implementation hit an overall capacity of $5 million for the first time on the back of Monday\u2019s action.Technical Bounce Or Something More?In a tongue-in-cheek response, Blockstream CSO Samson Mow concluded the new spike simply came down to investors buying and holding bitcoin.\u201cToday\u2019s spike in Bitcoin\u2019s price was caused by more people buying and holding.\u201d\u2013 Samson Mow(Media, feel free to quote me in the articles.)\u2014 Samson Mow (@Excellion) April 2, 2019That pattern is meanwhile playing out on trading platform BitMEX, which is seeing liquidations worth hundreds of millions of dollars as Bitcoin bounces downwards as well as upwards.Others hinted that, temporary or not, the $5000 reversal could signal the start of a new trend. Details were likewise few and far between. The social media personality known as Parabolic Trav, for example, made a rare reappearance on Twitter \u2013 a habit which tends only to accompany definitive price changes. On Monday, Bitcoinist\u2019s own Filb Filb predicted that underlying conditions would facilitate a Bitcoin price breakout in April. \u201cIn summary, the Bitcoin and wider crypto markets are showing all the positive signs one would expect to see of a market that is trying to find a bottom and is doing so consistently,\u201d he wrote, noting that volume depth remained a hurdle to a consistent reversal.In terms of finding its lows, analysts meanwhile remain split on whether Bitcoin\u2019s record bear market is set to continue longer. More optimistic last week was Pantera Capital, which identified next year\u2019s Bitcoin block reward halving as a catalyst for price growth. The knock-on effect could hit as soon as this June, it suggested, based on calculations from previous halving events. What do you think about the Bitcoin price reaching $5000?

Network nodes now number 7773, an increase of 11 percent versus one month ago, while the number of channels has reached 39,126, 24 percent more than at the start of March. The latest figures come on the back of continuing progress from developers, with Lightning\u2019s latest feature, Lightning Loop, being released late last month. Like the majority of major releases, Loop aims to simplify the process of using LN to transact, given mounting interest in what remains an experimental technology. As Bitcoinist reported, other more consumer-oriented services have also gone live recently, including a tool for ordering pizza using Lightning, something which creators intend to expand to cover Europe and Canada in addition to the US.Lightning Torch \u2018Burns\u2019 OnAdvocacy of Bitcoin Lightning Network has continued in recent weeks, despite more recently becoming overshadowed by the BTC price\u2019s own gains. Specifically, the Lightning Torch transaction relay has continued into its third month, involving more and more well-known figures from within and beyond cryptocurrency.Aiming to increase the public profile of both LN and Bitcoin itself, the \u2018Torch\u2019 tests Lightning\u2019s nascent implementation on the Bitcoin mainnet, and has so far remained successful. The latest \u2018holder\u2019 of the Torch is Bitcoin Core developer Marco Falke and, before him, Bruce Fenton, former executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, who received it March 31 from venture capital investor James Robinson. Other recent owners include Bitcoin vouchers platform Azteco\u2019s creator Akin Fernandez (known as Beautyon on Twitter), BitPesa CEO Elizabeth Rossiello and Litecoin creator Charlie Lee.Mining pool Slush Pool, Abra CEO Bill Barhydt and developer Peter Wuille have also been involved, following on from perhaps the most conspicuous owner of the Torch, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Dorsey\u2019s Square Crypto Shows Signs Of LifeHaving pledged in February to bring Lightning functionality to both Twitter and his payments platform Square, Dorsey continued to excite cryptocurrency advocates by seeking to hire dedicated developers to realize his plans.The venture, Square Crypto, already has its own Twitter account, which officials already appear to be using to educate mainstream consumers about the cryptocurrency industry.\u201cIf you\u2019ve never foolishly handed your private keys to a roving pillar of shimmering blue light, a thousand floating eyeballs, or a travelling merchant who grants wishes in exchange for favors, you\u2019re still new to crypto,\u201d their most recent message reads.The response to the position of Lightning developer has meanwhile been \u201coverwhelming,\u201d they added.What do you think about the Lightning Network\u2019s progress?

CNBC\u2019s resident Bitcoin expert, Brian Kelly, thinks so. The founder & CEO of BKCM LLC, a digital currency investment firm, stated his opinion on Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge this week on CNBC Fast Money \u2014 claiming that he believes this Bitcoin revival is real.\u201cI actually think it is a Bitcoin resurgence,\u201d Kelly told his fellow panelists, \u201cI think there\u2019s a really good chance that the December lows we saw in the $3000s were probably the lows for this cycle.\u201d\u2018A Strong Fundamental Tailwind\u2019One reason Kelly believes Bitcoin\u2019s resurgence is the real deal is that the first and foremost cryptocurrency has only been improving on the fundamental front \u2014 particularly in regards to network activity. He explained:There\u2019s a couple things that are going on. You\u2019ve seen improving fundamentals. You look at active addresses \u2014 that\u2019s one of the big metrics I look at. That\u2019s up 26 percent from the January lows. You look at transaction levels. Those are back to 2017 levels. So there\u2019s a lot of network activity.As Bitcoinist previously reported, Bitcoin handled its 400 millionth transaction April 8 \u2014 an impressive feat which only solidifies the fact that the market leader is here to stay. Bitcoin has also seen nearly 400,000 confirmed on-chain transactions in a 24-hour period, the highest network activity since the price of BTC was over $10,000 in January 2018.Institutional Interest at an All-Time HighKelly also notes that institutional interest for Bitcoin is growing rapidly, thanks to on-ramps from the likes of Fidelity and others. He explained:Then you look at who\u2019s buying this. You see people like Fidelity still rolling out their institutional platform. And then, as a proxy, look at the CME Bitcoin Futures. The large open-interest holders \u2014 so these are big institutions \u2014 those are at all-time highs. And it continues to grow. Last week they saw record volume on CME Bitcoin Futures. So you\u2019re starting to see institutional investors come in here with a good fundamental tailwind and that\u2019s got Bitcoin back in the saddle again.Indeed, institutional investors surely have a keen interest in buying the bottom. Bitcoin Will Surpass All-Time Highs \u2018Without Question\u2019If the bottom is truly in, the next question is: how high does Bitcoin go from here? According to Kelly, Bitcoin will easily surpass previous all-time highs during this market cycle. In fact, it\u2019s not even a question. He explained:Without question, [we surpass all-time highs] this next cycle. You\u2019re talking about probably a two-year cycle. Generally speaking, in 2020 the supply of Bitcoin is going to get cut in half. The cycle for Bitcoin is usually about a year before to a year after, so over this two year period you will likely get this big upswing and I think we surpass all-time highs.Top Altcoins \u2018Are Here to Stay\u2019For Kelly, Bitcoin won\u2019t be the only cryptocurrency that benefits from the next bull run. According to the prominent CNBC analyst, the top altcoins have proven themselves as viable contenders after surviving this \u2018crypto winter.\u2019 He noted:Well, so we had that insane ICO craze, right? And there\u2019s a lot of junk out there. A lot of those have gone to zero. I think you\u2019ve separated the wheat from the chaff. You\u2019ve got a lot of good altcoins \u2014 let\u2019s call them the top 10 or 20 in market cap \u2014 that I actually think are here to stay and will be big parts of the ecosystem.What are your favorite altcoins for the next bull run?

In withdrawing its protection, Ecuador made provision only for Assange not to legally face \u201ctorture or the death penalty.\u201dWikiLeaks Bitcoin Donations FlowingUnsurprisingly, cryptocurrency personalities who regularly rallied to Assange\u2019s defence for his work exposing corruption and similar misdemeanors by top-level organizations, renewed their support Thursday.Many linked to a fundraising initiative by WikiLeaks, donations to which can be made in Bitcoin and Zcash as well as via conventional means.At press time, the wallet address for Bitcoin donations contained a balance of 2.61 BTC ($13,200) with around 20 transactions occurring since Assange\u2019s arrest.\u201cTelling the world the TRUTH about war crimes, human rights abuses, corruption, election fraud and abuses of power IS NOT A CRIME,\u201d entrepreneur Kim Dotcom tweeted, highlighting the fundraiser.In a previous, now deleted tweet, Dotcom described Assange\u2019s arrest as a \u201cmoment of shame committed by the Ecuadorian, United Kingdom and United States government.\u201dEcuador had unofficially hinted about the arrest several days beforehand, without giving an exact timeframe. United Nations Among Assange SupportersAssange had maintained conspicuous support for his innocence until the last, notably from the United Nations itself, which last produced a statement calling for his freedom in December. \u201cStates that are based upon and promote the rule of law do not like to be confronted with their own violations of the law, that is understandable,\u201d the global entity\u2019s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) said in thinly-veiled criticism of the UK. But when they honestly admit these violations, they do honour the very spirit of the rule of law, earn enhanced respect for doing so, and set worldwide commendable examples.Assange had previously spoken highly favorably of Bitcoin, despite occasional opposition from the industry itself.As Bitcoinist reported, in April 2018, US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase suspended WikiLeaks\u2019 use of its services.More recently, WikiLeaks hit back at nChain chief scientist and Bitcoin SV promoter Craig Wright after the latter made derogatory claims of his own. \u201cCraig S. Wright is a proven serial forger of documents claiming that he is the inventor of Bitcoin,\u201d officials wrote on Twitter in February.What do you think about Julian Assange\u2019s arrest?

But while it urges financial inclusion, don\u2019t expect the IMF to embrace Bitcoin anytime soon.Lowest Economic Growth Since Financial CrisisAfter performing a downward revision, to the lowest since the financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently issued a grim warning:Global growth softened to 3.6 percent in 2018 and is projected to decline further to 3.3 percent in 2019.One of the cures the IMF proposes is to boost financial inclusion.The IMF blames the significant weakening of the global expansion, the lowest in a decade, on several factors, mainly the ongoing China-United States trade war, Argentinean and Turkish macroeconomic difficulties, and German auto industry woes.To exacerbate the issue, US President Donald Trump is now threatening to impose tariffs on cars imported from the European Union, which could result in German carmakers losing billions of dollars.Another culprit that the IMF impugns for the weakening economy is the \u201cfinancial tightening alongside the normalization of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies.\u201dIMF: Economies Must be More InclusiveAccording to the IMF, to reactivate global economic growth, among other things, it is imperative that financial and government authorities make their economies more inclusive.The IMF has been a leading proponent of financial inclusion, at least on the surface, highlighting the benefits of digital currencies. In November 2018, a staff discussion note stated that a,Central Bank Digital Currency could strengthen the benefits and reduce some of the costs and risks to the payment system and could help encourage financial inclusion.Moreover, at the 2018 Singapore Fintech Festival, IMF CEO Christine Lagarde addressed the issue of financial inclusion and how digitalization was reshaping economic activity.In her speech, she remarked how innovative payment providers using e-money were responding to people\u2019s demands for and the requirements of the economy. In this regard, she said,Let me start with financial inclusion, where digital currency offers great promise, through its ability to reach people and businesses in remote and marginalized regions. We know that banks are not exactly rushing to serve poor and rural populations.And Lagarde added:Even cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple are vying for a spot in the cashless world, constantly reinventing themselves in the hope of offering more stable value, and quicker, cheaper settlement.Virtual Currency Offers Great Promise, But\u2026Conversely, in the same speech, the IMF chief was concerned that \u201cContinued rapid growth of crypto assets could create new vulnerabilities in the international financial system.\u201dAt the same time, the IMF head favors retrofitting identity checkpoints (i.e. chokepoints) into cryptocurrencies to maintain \u2018financial stability.\u2019 In other words, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are great as long as governments and central banks retain control.She argued for imposing KYC/AML regulations to ensure that the users\u2019 identities are adequately recorded. This, however, would undoubtedly add friction, undermining the entire idea of financial inclusion.However, Lagarde cautioned central banks not to block technological progress, saying:This brings me to my third area\u2014the potential downsides of digital currency. The obvious ones are risks to financial integrity and financial stability. But I would also like to highlight risks of stifling innovation\u2014the last thing you want.The IMF being against \u201cstifling innovation\u201d does sound promising. However, it\u2019s doubtful that the IMF chief will support Bitcoin as an open alternative to the global banking system.How do you think a global growth decline impacts Bitcoin\u2019s price?

The $5000 mark now lies around $150 away, Bitcoin having last traded below that level on April 7. How Low Can It Go?Correspondingly, online commentators were showing signs of misgivings about short-term price potential. \u201cOn a daily scale, the dynamic is turning into a sideways trend, the bullish momentum might be\u2026 out of steam,\u201d one analyst wrote in a dissection of Bitcoin\u2019s latest performance on social media.As Bitcoinist reported, data from well-known data guru Willy Woo released this week nonetheless pointed to a $5000 Bitcoin price signalling a bounce off the latest bear market bottom \u2013 something which appears to form part of a trend extending back to the cryptocurrency\u2019s inception.His experimental metric, dubbed Cumulative Value-days Destroyed (CVDD), focused on trading habits to provide an historical trend corridor for Bitcoin price.\u201cCVDD has hit the historical Bitcoin price bottoms with remarkable accuracy,\u201d he summarized.Altcoins Feel Bitcoin InsecurityElsewhere in crypto markets meanwhile, altcoin investors felt the pain of Bitcoin\u2019s sideways trading, its roughly 1 percent drop spelling significant volatility for other coins.A look at the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap from CoinMarketCap revealed unpalatable performance Thursday, with largest altcoin Ether down 6 percent in 24 hours. Others fared worse, with TRON down 9.1 percent, NEO 8 percent, and Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash both dropping around 7 percent.The figures cap a trend which continues to revolve around many altcoins mimicking Bitcoin\u2019s performance, then delivering an exaggerated move of their own. Bucking that behavior Thursday was Tezos, which managed to sustain 1 percent gains over the past 24 hours. The asset had been buoyed by a decision from cryptocurrency exchange Binance to add it to its official wallet as it prepares to add a staking feature for Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies. Late last month, US exchange Coinbase also released Tezos staking via its Coinbase Custody spin-off.What do you think about Bitcoin price?

People around the world are fascinated by the South African business tycoon and his electronic cars and behemoth spaceships. But, guess what? They\u2019re far more curious about a sustainable alternative financial system that serves their interest rather than the banks.Take a look at the above chart from Google Trends over the last seven days. That\u2019s not Elon or even the SpaceX Launch that\u2019s thrusting upwards in red. That\u2019s Bitcoin searches worldwide, baby, not people wondering about the Falcon Heavy delay.South Africans Prefer Bitcoin to Elon MuskTake a look at Google searches in South Africa, the country with the highest number of cryptocurrency owners in the world. Despite being born and raised in this country, people here aren\u2019t all that interested in Elon\u2019s latest exploits.That\u2019s probably because being able to transfer value abroad, run a thriving business, receive remittances without punishing fees, and even make money by savvy investing are all far more useful to people than flying to Mars.Especially in countries like South Africa, Nigeria, and Venezuela where citizens need to deal with the reality of their everyday lives. What problem is Bitcoin solving for them? In many cases, it\u2019s preventing their savings from being wiped out, in others, it\u2019s skipping bureaucratical steps and letting people get on with their work.

He has over thirty years of direct experience as a trader, industry worker, and advisor. He has held licenses to advise on stocks, commodities, derivatives, and retirement planning and holds the designation of Fellow of the Canadian Securities Institute. Brian was a funded proprietary Crude Oil trader through TopStepTrader.com but left that industry in 2013 to pursue a career within the cryptocurrency space. Brian demonstrated to the public how to take $500 and turn it into $100,000 in a little over two years using some very basic low-risk concepts learned through his career.While Brian does currently trade his own personal accounts and those of The Rational Investor, he spends most of his time helping people new to trading set themselves up for success and has proudly taught hundreds (maybe even thousands) of people how to achieve their desired goals from trading over the past five years through TheRationalInvestor.com website and public offerings.Bitcoinist recently caught up with Beamish to pick his brain on what it really takes to be a full-time trader in an unforgiving market.What are the biggest mistakes and false assumptions new traders have about trading?The biggest mistakes new traders make is that they think they will get rich quick or make unrealistic profits in a short period of time. Of course, this is not true. The amount of time needed to set oneself up for success in the world of trading is significant and cannot be understated.The key is to forget about making money. Rather, new traders must concentrate on the process \u2014 which is usually not the case. The public tends to focus more on results and less on how to achieve favorable results. In doing so, they fail to learn about what is required to be successful.How did you get started trading, initially?It was a High School summer job. I caught \u2018the bug\u2019 way back in the 1980s.How can someone manage to wait for a trade to come to fruition when, in reality, you have to pay the bills?Well, there are some simple rules to follow in this case.One\u2019s trading capital should not be part of one\u2019s living expense capital.One should always have three months of living expenses in cash reserves.Get a part-time job to pay the bills, if you must.What sort of capital does someone really need to succeed in the markets?It really depends on how one defines success.Because of the low barrier of entry, cryptocurrency portfolios can start very small. To trade larger markets \u2014 futures, stocks, commodities, options \u2014 one should have a larger account.People discount the power of compounding returns. One can start with a very small capital base and, if you continually re-invest and let your capital grow, it can turn into a very sizable sum over time.How long do you need to be a successful trader before you could realistically consider quitting your day job?I would recommend only considering \u2018quitting your day job\u2019 if you have at least one year\u2019s income already made and in the bank ready to pay for next year\u2019s salary. That might happen very quickly, but most of my students require at least one full year of training before they are ready to risk large sums in the market and begin working on building that following year\u2019s salary.Humans are emotional animals. How can you remain emotionally unattached to a trade to ensure you don\u2019t sustain unnecessary losses?One good idea is to practice journalling \u2014 essentially downloading your emotions \u2014 and tracking your behavior closely. This is usually where most fail, actually, as many people are impatient and have a lack of discipline.Crypto markets are 24/7. How do you manage to have a good work/life balance?To keep the balance, it is important to outline clearly in your trading plan when you expect to participate in the market. At the same time, outline clearly in your trading plan how/when you can disconnect from your trading and enjoy social activities, sports, time with family, etc.How do you manage to successfully add structure and discipline to a career choice that is essentially about being free to do what you want?It\u2019s true that we are, by definition, \u2018discretionary traders\u2019\u2014 but that does not mean we can trade at our discretion. This career choice requires even more discipline then a 9-to-5 \u2018job\u2019 most people have.A \u2018trader\u2019 is really a small business owner/operator, so what are the common characteristics of successful small business owner/operators? If you can answer that question, you\u2019re on the path to being a successful full-time trader.Being a full-time trader can be a lonely job since there often times isn\u2019t much interaction with others \u2014 like in a traditional workplace. How can full-time traders balance this out?To help offset any potential feelings of loneliness, one can participate in a robust community of peers \u2014 like The Rational Investor! (.#ShamelessPlug)As mentioned previously, it is important to build incorporate support systems into you plan and budget in time for leisure, fun, and a personal life.One can also become a mentor to others and/or volunteer in their free time. This really does help keep things in perspective.How do you manage all of your transactions and wins and losses \u2014 what system/journals do you need to use. Is a journal/ tracking system paramount to success?There are many products out there to help with journaling and the tracking of behaviors, as well as trading activity. I recommend taking a very manual approach, to begin with \u2014 such as using a word processor or even handwritten journaling \u2014 as it will force you to take personal ownership of your actions.Once you have a trading plan in place and setups that have been fully vetted, one can move on to more automated data tracking \u2014 but journalling never really changes. The more you write, the better!How isn\u2019t technical analysis like astrology?It might be very much like astrology. In fact, some of the most famous traders in history used astrology to help them time their transactions! But comparing one to the other is missing the point of why one would use technical analysis.One should come up with reasons for acting in the marketplace, then try to replicate that behavior repeatedly using those same reasons over and over again. Some use Fundamental Analysis. Some use Technical analysis. And yes, some even use astrology.Mr. John Bollinger coined the term \u2018rational analysis\u2019 decades ago as the intersection of fundamental and technical analysis \u2014 where we as \u2018rational\u2019 investors only act when both fundamental and technical reasons agree). We use these \u2018reasons\u2019 to better the odds of seeing our desired outcome (profitable trades), but that\u2019s all they are. Nothing more.Could we incorporate astrological reasons to act in our setups? Absolutely! The only thing that matters is that, when we trade with those reasons, they are consistent and they produce desired results more often than not \u2014 ideally, better than 60 percent of the time.How you get your reasons is entirely up to the individual. Being professional and acting when you see those reasons \u2014 that\u2019s what separates the amateurs from the professionals.Many believe that the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets are manipulated by whales and exchanges, and there have been recent reports to back up the latter. What is your take on this?It makes little difference to those who trade setups and follows their plan. If the conditions you require for you to act present themselves, as laid out in your plan, then, as a professional, you must act. If those conditions do not present themselves, then you must have the professionalism not to act.We have to ask \u2014 what are your long-term predictions for Bitcoin?I can absolutely tell you without a shadow of a doubt. What will happen will be more bizarre and more unpredictable than anything we could come up with here \u2014 you can\u2019t write better fiction than reality!Having said that, my personal feeling is cryptocurrencies will, at some point, replace the \u2018fiat currency\u2019 model. What that implies for Bitcoin is more demand (yes, higher prices) but, at the same time, it implies many many more types of cryptocurrencies will come to market. This will increase competition as technology evolves.The question for bitcoin at present is; does it remain a \u2018store of value\u2019 story? If so, then I would expect a sideways market for the next fifteen years. Or can it evolve into a utility and thus increase adoption as a usable asset (via the Lightning Network, for example) and, thus, become a growth vehicle? If so, prices could get astronomical. (Get it?)Do you have any parting wisdom for our readers?It is my firm belief that we are all great traders. We all have good ideas and, generally, we all have the best intentions. The problem is we make mistakes! Most of the time, those mistakes come from being either too impatient or lacking discipline.Since we humans are emotional creatures, we tend to take failure personally \u2014 which leads to frustration. This leads to more emotional behavior, which ends up turning into an endless loop of anxiety that most often culminates in erratic and illogical activity based more on desperation rather than logical, well laid out planning. The novice often ends up \u2018blowing themselves up\u2019 and losing a lot of money in the market out of the expression of those frustrations. Sadly, our capitalist machine actually depends on that emotional activity.Additionally, we are social creatures, which means we seek validation for our actions from our peers. Unfortunately, doing what is \u2018popular\u2019 and \u2018making money from trading\u2019 are almost polar opposites. Because of this, to be a good trader, one often must do what is unpopular amongst the herd \u2014 and this can be difficult for many.To overcome those human failings, we must plan and hold ourselves accountable. One must look in the proverbial mirror and commit to making the necessary changes in our behavior if we see we are making those mistakes mentioned above. This isn\u2019t easy and is often the reason why so few of us can actually do well from trading.The Rational Investor\u2019s whole mission is about helping people do exactly this. Through our education programs, we teach people how to take responsibility for their actions and put into place the supports needed to make the necessary changes that are required to evolve from a typical public market participant to a professional. These include (but are not limited to) building and vetting your trading plan, as well as building the necessary supports for you to be able to follow that plan.We help with the understanding how to construct higher probability \u2018setups\u2019 and appreciation/identification for the type of risk taker you are and, thus, build risk management strategies around what type of market participant you have identified yourself as being. Furthermore, we assist in building a framework of market expectations so your profit objectives are clearly defined and realistic.As I repeatedly say to the public, judging The Rational Investor based on what I say is meaningless. Listening to our students and the change we have effected in their lives is priceless.Thank you very much for your time and I hope I have helped you understand both myself and what The Rational Investor does as professional educators a little better.Sincerely,Brian BeamishThe Rational Investor(and the whole TRI team)Stay tuned to Bitcoinist, as we\u2019ve partnered with The Rational Investor to giveaway one 12-week trading course for free \u2014 valued at $1195.

However, such a scheme would still be inferior to Bitcoin, according to Russian economist Vladislav Ginko. Russia Targets \u2018Monetary Reset\u2019Russia was the biggest buyer of gold last year and has quadrupled its gold reserves over the past decade. In fact, the country has ramped up its buying spree in recent years, in particular, after US-led economic sanctions were imposed in 2014. Notably, Russia\u2019s central bank added 651.5 metric tons in 2018 \u2014 74 percent higher than in 2017, according to the World Gold Council. It is estimated that the country now holds approximately 34,000 tons of gold.But Russia isn\u2019t alone. China showing similar behavior buying 32.95 tons of gold in Q1 2019.So why are the two neighboring superpowers so bent on boosting their gold reserves? Bruno Ma\u00e7\u00e3es, former Europe minister of Portugal, says that while there\u2019s no formal coordination, the two countries can expect mutual benefits in undermining the US dollar as a world reserve currency.\u201cThe sheer size of the purchases might reveal bolder motives, with Moscow preparing its first salvo in the coming battle for a monetary reset,\u201d he adds.Russian \u2018GoldCoin\u2019?But Ma\u00e7\u00e3es also suggests that this potential \u2018reset\u2019 could also have ulterior motives. He writes: These moves come at a moment when gold has become attractive as the anchor for new experiments in digital currencies. Gold and crypto are a marriage made in heaven, combining the stability of gold with the convenience and security of the blockchain.These digital tokens would circulate on a global online platform and and would be \u201centirely backed by gold reserves held in an international trust insulating them from state interference.\u201dInterestingly, he notes that private financial institutions would be responsible for creating these \u2018goldcoins\u2019 and would therefore ultimately control the supply. At the same time, transactions would be peer-to-peer.Money transactions would be processed directly between end users, with no intermediation from banks or governments.There\u2019s Just a Few ProblemsHowever, the former EU minster displays only superficial knowledge of blockchain technology. For one, calling it a \u2018blockchain\u2019 doesn\u2019t automatically make the network \u201cconvenient,\u201d let alone \u201csecure.\u201dSecondly, its node software must be distributed between peers all over the globe. It cannot be limited to a few datacenters operated by a handful of private insitutions. Such a scheme re-introduces central points of failure making it a cryptocurrency in name only.In other words, one can\u2019t just flip a switch to activate a secure and trustless blockchain. It takes years if not decades for the network effect to make it viable and valuable (think: internet).Thirdly, regardless of relative price stability, gold\u2019s physical properties still entail costs of transfer, storage, and trust.The latter, in particular, would be a big problem for Russia. To wit, gold isn\u2019t a risk-free asset when it comes to geopolitics. Venezuela, for example, learned this lesson the hard way earlier this year.Not your vault, not your gold. https://t.co/ThSkkuXGqO\u2014 Jesse Powell (@jespow) January 25, 2019\u201c[G]old is a US based asset and the experience of Venezuela has shown that in case of severe financial US sanctions Russia might also face the sell of gold would be impossible since such a deal would require USD nominated transactions,\u201d Kremlin economist, Vladislav Ginko, told Bitcoinist.\u2018Gold is Highly Risky\u2019 Unlike BitcoinBitcoin, on the other hand, has been battle-tested for over a decade. It\u2019s blockchain is secured by a staggering amount of increasing computing power, making it the de facto \u2018metric system\u2019 of cryptocurrencies today.Moreover, despite price volatility and being \u2018unbacked\u2019 \u2014 one bitcoin will always equal one bitcoin. But more importantly, there\u2019s no central authority that can change the rules. This makes it the world\u2019s most politically-nuetral form of money ever and an ideal foundation to build not only applications but a new global economy.Ginko, who previously stated that Russian have bought over $6.8 billion in bitcoin for these reasons, agrees.\u201cBitcoin goes well so Russia doesn\u2019t consider issuing gold backed stablecoin since gold is USD based asset. And its valuation and opportunities to sell this asset might be very limited in case of new US sanctions,\u201d he said.Gold is highly risky, unstable asset for Russia.So then why is Russia buying so much gold if the precious metal is still largely controlled by the US?Ginko says the reason has more to do with its domestic gold mining industry. He explained:The gold accrual by Russia\u2019s central bank looks significant only in physical terms. But in relative terms this is a minor fraction of total reserves (less 19%). The main reason of Russian gold buying is to support the gold market. In 2018\u2026 Russia exported only 5,4% (3,4 times less than in 2017 year) of its gold produced so the huge amount of this domestic metal output was bought out by the central bank.Will Russia and China attempt to create a gold-backed stablecoin?

Bitcoinist | Apr 11, 2019 | 16:00 Share Tweet Send Share A step back in time if you can recall\u2026In early 2018 #MetaHash announced the public debut of its #TraceChain protocol and #MetaGate browser. There was the question: can the #MetaHash network solve many of the issues currently plaguing the industry, including partial centralization, high fees, and slow transaction speeds?Surprising to its detractors, #Metahash is now one of the best blockchain technologies, already working with a trx time of 1 to 3 seconds, and a very smart commercial strategy. For sure this is one of the few winning blockchain projects for 2019. Metahash indeed has kept abreast of its development roadmap, trailblazing the direction for the cryptocurrency community to branch off from older, existing blockchains that are \u201cstagnating due to low scalability and a lack of smart contract or DApp functionality\u201d.With the public debut of #TraceChain protocol and #MetaGate browser, crypto experts are anticipating that #MetaHash will hurdle a major uphill battle of widespread adoption. Look again. Starting from the launch of MainNet on May 30, 2018, #MetaHash team has been fully immersed into the further development following the technology pipeline, and now, after almost a year it\u2019s the right time to look back at what has been achieved and what future is just around the corner.MainNet, launched at the end of spring 2018, is constantly growing. Every week new server nodes are established by the community and the total amount for today reaching 500 nodes.Network\u2019s performance and its further improvement look quite optimistic as well. According to statistics the hardware which #MetaHash community uses is more advanced than ones been used for tests by the dev team which means that the initially declared 50k+ may significantly increase.The network will proceed on its way to decentralization. Soon the second and other types of node roles will be introduced \u2013 5 or more according to our further development surveys. The rewards distribution of Forging, which is already live for more than a month, will be updated as well to promote the further growth of the distributed network \u2013 more random rewards will be granted to those who will be ready to allocate more computer resources and run #MetaHash client 24/7.A lot of plans are waiting in the wings, Just to think some dubious quarters had initially considered #MetaHash as a \u201cvery ambitious project\u201d. What do you say to this? Take a look and get yourself a bit of the action. Do not just aim for the profit but support what it can do to change the global economy."}

Of the almost 26,000 votes cast, 56 percent chose cryptocurrency, while another 29 percent selected mobile phone payment. With the continued integration of cryptocurrency payments onto mobile platforms, perhaps some of those 29 percent could pivot to the crypto side. Meanwhile, cash and bank card payments so far have a combined total of 15 percent on the poll.However, ongoing developments in the virtual currency payment arena mean that the options provided by the IMF aren\u2019t necessarily mutually exclusive.Case in point, Coinbase on Wednesday (April 10, 2019) announced the launch of their cryptocurrency Visa card. The card allows UK customers to spend Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies instantly at every Visa-accepting merchant, i.e. everywhere.A portion of the company\u2019s blog post announcing the launch reads:Coinbase Card supports all crypto assets available to buy and sell on the Coinbase platform, meaning they can pay for a meal with bitcoin, or use ethereum to fund their train ticket home.Bitcoin Accepting Merchants Increasing GloballyCryptocurrency in many ways is an extension of the cashless trend that continues to take root across the world as consumers aim for greater retail payment convenience.As previously reported by Bitcoinist, a Kaspersky Labs research showed that 13 percent of people across 22 countries have used Bitcoin (BTC) to make purchases.There are already restaurants in different parts of the world that accept cryptocurrency as payment for meals. More than 1,500 restaurants in Denmark alone accept Bitcoin. There are also establishments in New Jersey and Nyeri, just outside of Nairobi, Kenya that take crypto as payment for meals.According to Coinmap, there are more than 14,600 establishments that accept Bitcoin across the world. This figure takes into account cafes and restaurants.Issues with Cryptocurrency MicropaymentsAccording to a recently published research by DataLight, Bitcoin is already the preferred choice for large value cross-border transfer due to the fee structure. However, the report goes further to predict that Bitcoin will surpass Visa and Mastercard for micropayments within the next decade.There are a few issues that could potentially emerge in the wake of such a trend. The first is the tax implications attached to making retail payments via Bitcoin given the spotty cryptocurrency taxation in many jurisdictions.The revelation that the Bakkt lunch could see the arrival of \u201cBitcoin for Starbucks coffee\u201d did bring up this particular consideration. If laws aren\u2019t created write-off cryptocurrency microtransactions, then tax filing might become onerous for those who pay for lunch with BTC.Another issue is the incentive for people to spend what is essentially a valuable investment for lunch and other micropayments. In Arnhem, for example, the place dubbed \u201cworld\u2019s most Bitcoin-friendly city\u201d has seen a gradual drop in the use of BTC for payments.Will everyone be paying for lunch with cryptocurrency in 5 years?

Hodlonaut, who became well known in his own right this year as the creator of the Lightning Torch Bitcoin transaction relay, deleted his Twitter account when Wright\u2019s threat surfaced.Since then, Wright has offered a bounty of 70 BSV tokens ($5000) to anyone who can \u2018dox\u2019 Hodlonaut, revealing his real identity or other personal information. The legal challenge immediately spurred some of the best-known names in Bitcoin to action, with Zhao\u2019s pledge the latest in a wave of pushback which has even seen many change their Twitter handles to include the term \u2018Hodlonaut.\u2019This, it is assumed, makes it all the more difficult for Wright and his followers to harass users who criticize their claims. Wright, already notorious for his own social media outbursts, maintains that he is the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.\u201cCraig Wright is not Satoshi,\u201d Zhao retaliated. \u201cAnymore of this (shit), we delist!\u201dCraig Wright is not Satoshi.Anymore of this sh!t, we delist! https://t.co/hrnt3fDACq\u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) April 12, 2019Bitcoin SV Dumps 20 PercentBSV 00 has crashed in the days since Wright publicly announced the court proceedings and bounty. At press time, the token was trading down almost 8 percent in 24 hours, taking its weekly losses to more than 20 percent. Since the bounty announcement, the contents of Wright\u2019s letter to Hodlonaut have trickled online. The letter\u2019s contents, allegedly from a UK-based law firm, contain highly-suspicious language of an almost deliberately fake nature, mirroring some of Wright\u2019s own language. Among its suggestions to Hodlonaut is a prescribed apology, which instructs him to refer to Wright as \u2018Dr. Wright\u2019 yet does not mention Nakamoto\u2019s full name. The full text reads:I was wrong to allege Craig Wright fraudulently claimed to be Satoshi. I accept he is Satoshi. I am sorry Dr. Wright. I will not repeat this libel.\u2018So This Is\u2026 Bullish?\u2019Meanwhile, efforts from elsewhere in Bitcoin continue to surface, chiefly from \u2018What Bitcoin Did\u2019 podcast host Peter McCormack, who openly invited BSV proponents to sue him as well as Hodlonaut. Others openly denounced Wright, who himself currently faces a minimum $5 billion lawsuit over alleged theft of huge amounts of Bitcoin from a former business partner.The Bitcoin SV blockchain now contains at least one transaction with the message \u2018Craig Wright is a fraud\u2019 forever embedded inside.Uh oh!

What\u2019s most notable about this update is that it now seems the United Kingdom will be participating in the European Parliament Elections on May 23rd.The implications of this are probably more intricate than the workings of a black hole and negotiating this exit seems more complicated than photographing one. The markets seem to be taking this news in their stride.Looking at the Pound Sterling over the last few weeks, it actually seems surprisingly stable. Watch out for that descending triangle with psychological support at 1.30.Bitcoin ChartAs you know, we\u2019ve been tracking a new resistance level on Bitcoin at $5,350 (dotted white line). Last night, it managed to break this level, but not in a good way. As you can see, the move higher was quickly followed by a move lower, making this a false breakout.At the moment, it\u2019s testing the historically important figure of $5,000 per coin, but if it falls below that it will be interesting to see where it finds support.Did the Fed move Bitcoin?The question here is what drove it over that line and back again?Some have suggested that it was a result of the Federal Reserve announcement, which seems pretty intriguing given that Wall Street is now making up a more significant portion of this market.At a glance, it seems that this theory may even hold water. The time of the announcement can be seen in purple here.As we know, correlation does not necessarily mean causation, but what we can say is that in the 30 minutes following the announcement Bitcoin experienced more volatility than gold, the Dow Jones, and the US Dollar combined.Of course, traditional markets weren\u2019t at all surprised by the fact that the Fed is being cautious, nor that their caution, if left unchecked, could lead to risks down the road. It\u2019s just that the narrative that Bitcoin is rising on insecurity surrounding the Fed could be particularly compelling to some.Updates: Still looking to pass the torch off soon enough.

After Bitcoin price 00 rose $1300 in days to hit $5330 last week, the BMI saw a dramatic awakening. Having previously languished at 34 at the end of March, its latest reading is 89 \u2013 the highest since June 2016. $3K Was Bitcoin Price \u2018Bottom\u2019For Lee, this brings mixed signals, the Fundstrat senior analyst following in the footsteps of veteran trader Tone Vays in declaring the bullish momentum behind Bitcoin may not mean an unequivocal reversal. Unlike Vays, however, he suggested that the main message behind Bitcoin price was that it was unlikely to drop below $3000 any longer \u2013 while Vays has kept up to $1000 in play. \u201cThe main takeway (sic) is that BMI reaching 67 is further evidence the bear market for Bitcoin likely ended at $3,000,\u201d Lee summarized.The upturn likely caught Lee, along with many others, by surprise. Prior to the surge, Lee had even pledged to stop giving Bitcoin price forecasts.\u201cBecause of the inherent volatility in crypto, we will cease to provide any timeframes for the realization of fair value,\u201d he told Fundstrat clients in December.

At press time Friday, Bitcoin price has recovered modestly to nearly $5100 through the day after falling from highs of $5440.With the exception of momentary blips, Bitcoin has now held onto support at $5000 since April 5.

The decentralized computing network that uses Bitcoin as the basis for its DApps filed a statement with the SEC to hold the first $50 million token offering using the SEC Reg A+ framework. Is this the start of many more to come?ICOs Have Dropped Off a CliffICOs were all the rage in financing in 2017 and even the first few months of 2018, until they quickly dropped off a cliff, killed by regulation. ICOs, RIP\u2014 Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) October 11, 2018When companies started finding out that what they were doing was tripping into securities territory and could actually be illegal, this type of unregulated free-for-all token sale sharply ended.Depending on the jurisdiction, most blockchain companies are moving to new ways of financing. That\u2019s either through STOs, private VCs, equity token offerings (ETOs), or a securities exemption such as the Reg CF. Thus far, no other blockchain company has filed to the SEC to hold a Reg A+. Why?Securities Exemption Breakdowns in the U.S.Blockchain companies looking to raise funds through regulated token sales in the U.S. currently have four options. None of them is perfect. They can register with the SEC and hold an IPO, something expensive and prohibitive to most blockchain companies.They can select a Reg D 506 (C) that allows them to quickly raise funds with no cap on the raise and very limited effort (they simply fill out a form). But there\u2019s a catch. They can only solicit accredited investors.To get around that, a few companies have been going for the Reg CF option, which stands for Regulation Crowdfunding. As the name suggests, this is more inclusive and open to anyone over the age of 18. Companies can also do it with limited effort. But they better not have hopes of raising very much. If they need more than $1.07 million, this option won\u2019t work for them. This brings us to what Blockstack (the Bitcoin company that rebranded from Onename back in 2016) is choosing, the Reg A+.Bitcoin-backed DApp Platform Blockstack Files for Reg A+SEC-approved Reg A+ allows Blockstack to raise up to $50 million compliantly. The token sale will also be open to anyone over the age of 18 (not just accredited). So, if they can include everyone and raise up to $50 million, why isn\u2019t everyone doing it? Because there are much higher costs involved with holding a Reg A+ that keep many companies at the gates.Moreover, it\u2019s (currently) a lengthy and strenuous process and companies must provide two years of audited financials. However, while this was something completely impossible back in 2017, now that many blockchain companies are reaching maturity, Reg A+ could be a way forward for them.Once the Blockstack Reg A+ filing is approved (assuming that it is) it will be the first SEC-qualified token offering of its kind.Co-Founder and Blockstack CEO Muneeb Ali enthused:Upon qualification, we believe that this offering may be the first time a blockchain project receives approval to access the public U.S. securities markets\u2026 This can potentially set a precedent for others in the industry.Yet Reg A+ Is Still Too Restrictive for MostWhile Reg A+ could be the way forward for established and profit-making companies in the space, it\u2019s not the solution for all. The need for two years of audited financials immediately disqualifies startups. The high cost associated with it may also dissuade others in the blockchain industry scrambling to survive the crypto winter.Blockstack isn\u2019t your average struggling blockchain company, either. It was created by computer scientists from Princeton University with the goal of decentralizing the internet using the Bitcoin blockchain as a base. Blockstack previously raised investor capital in the form of a Reg D from big gun investors like Lux Capital and Union Square Ventures. We\u2019re not talking about a one-man band here. It\u2019s probably too early to decide whether this will set a precedent for other Bitcoin and blockchain firms yet.Will Blockstack be approved by the SEC?

Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsOne of the biggest concerns among investors over the last year or so has been the possibility that the world\u2019s central banks would make a \u201cpolicy mistake.\u201dIt seems that now, one of the world\u2019s most renowned market commentators and the man who literally wrote the book on central banks, Mohammed El-Arian, says that the Fed may have just made a huge mistake by shifting gears too quickly.This is a recurring theme that we\u2019ve been writing about in these updates for some time. How exactly, or more importantly, when exactly, this will affect the markets remains to be seen.A dovish Fed usually has the effect of sending stocks higher. What we don\u2019t know is how the global economy will react from them changing from tapping the breaks to pushing the gas pedal to the floor so darn quickly.Interesting MeetingsThe biannual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund started out with a bang today.Here\u2019s the head of the IMF on camera with some interesting statements about cryptoassets.Notice, that she draws the lines here by saying that it\u2019s the banker cryptos that are doing the shaking as she tries to exclude bitcoin from the party.Somehow, I just don\u2019t think that JP Morgan coin was what more than half of some 37,000 respondents had in mind when they answered this IMF twitter poll.Earlier this week, Lagarde hosted a hot debate that pitted JP Morgan against Circle. I haven\u2019t seen it yet but definitely looks popcorn-worthy.The meetings will continue throughout the weekend, but honestly, I can\u2019t imagine how the above interview can possibly be topped.EpilogueAfter the false breakout earlier this week, cryptos took a step down over the last 24 hours. The fact that we failed to go further up speaks volumes about the current appetite, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it will go lower, as many bears have indicated.In fact, in my view, the most likely scenario is that we now create a new range, or even, hopefully, a sustained stabilization. Even as I write this though, I see that Messari\u2019s real 10 volume number is still elevated above $600 million. So the market is clearly still excited.Happy to report that the bitcoin lightning torch is on the final hop of its journey to Venezuela.Also, more importantly in the Greenspan family, both mom and baby are healthy and happy. Many thanks to all of the jubilant responses on social media, we\u2019re certainly feeling the love.Some have pointed out that technically speaking, the torch was in my possession when the baby was born, so we\u2019ll certainly need to think up a suitable name for the child of the torch.Speaking of happy endings, I think we\u2019re all looking forward to something spectacular this Sunday. My personal hope is that the mother of dragons and the bastard king manage to beat back their enemies, but this show has a tendency to be just about as predictable as the financial markets.Wishing you all a very pleasant weekend.Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalystYour Social Investment Network \u2013 www.eToro.comeToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

If passed, those changes may cause immigrants in the US to turn to alternatives, such as Bitcoin. White House to Cut Remittances to MexicoThe White House is reportedly going to target remittance payments which made by illegal US immigrants, the Daily Caller reports citing a senior administration official.These plans are coming amid a larger shakeup taking place at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as an attempt to curb illegal immigration. Reportedly, thousands of migrants are arriving on a daily basis at the southern US border, claiming asylum.The statement comes following a proposition from former Kansas State Secretary of State, Kris Kobach. Speaking on the matter of ending remittances from illegal Mexican immigrants in the US, he outlined:The threat I propose is one that actually helps us if we follow through on it. That is the threat of ending remittances from the majority of people in the United States from Mexico who are here illegally. That is a threat that we could carry through on that actually helps our economy because the money is not sent home, it stays in circulation in the U.S. economy and helps rev up our economy. It\u2019s actually a good thing if we follow through.It\u2019s not the first time Trump has turned his sights to remittances from the US to Mexico. Back in 2017, he threatened to tax or to halt them as means of funding to build a wall along the entire southern border.Why It\u2019s Good For BitcoinIt\u2019s unclear exactly how much money illegal Mexican immigrants in the US send home. However, according to one report, 2018 saw a total of around $33 billion sent in remittances from the US to Mexico. Moreover, this is one of the largest sources of foreign capital in Mexico.Prohibiting Mexican immigrants in the US to send money back home with conventional means is perhaps likely to cause those people to look for alternatives, rather than halting remittances in general.In fact, this was reiterated by Kobach himself, who said:There will always be ways to circumvent things you put in place. Yes, if we stop wire transfers and bank transfers, there may be ways to get around it and one way to get around it is to send cash in the mail.And while putting cash in an envelope and sending it across the border is, indeed, an alternative, Bitcoin provides for a much more safer and quicker transfer of value. It is also a politically nuetral and borderless financial network where no central authority can impose capital controls.For these reasons, Bitcoin has already become a preferred alternative in countries facing political and economic crisis. This includes use-cases such as remittance payments in Venezuela and other Latin American nations.Moreover, Venezuela even took measures to profit from the growing market, imposing a 15 percent fee on all Bitcoin and cryptocurrency remittance payments.In any case, this seems like yet one more reason for which Trump could turn out to be Bitcoin\u2019s biggest champion.What do you think of the US plan to halt remittances to Mexico?

Bitcoin delivered its most successful seven days in more than a year last week, jumping from near $4100 to more than $5300. Trade volumes and network activity increased accordingly as BTC price capped a 7-week winning streak, the longest since its all-time highs in late 2017. At the time, many expected the rise to be short lived, but as of press time, Bitcoin price remains hovering around $5200, having traded within a narrow $100 range over the past 24 hours.Despite that stability, however, Vays implied a sudden price explosion does not form a firm foundation for longer-term strength. That argument had also appeared before, however, during the 2017 bull run that saw Bitcoin price shoot to nearly $20,000. In December, meanwhile, Vays had warned Bitcoin could end its bear market only when price had hit $3000 or even lower \u2013 around $1300 or the all-time high seen during the previous bull cycle in 2013.In the event, BTC/USD neared $3100 before reversing through the first quarter of 2019. \u201cI can see a scenario where I say: \u2018I was wrong, (Bitcoin) did bottom at $3k, now that we are at $8k,\u2019 Vays explained about his current perspective. But I can also say: \u2018I know (Bitcoin) is $10k, but I don\u2019t think we bottomed.\u2019Cause For Concern?Vays has traditionally held more conservative outlook on Bitcoin\u2019s price health, contrasting with others who remain buoyant about a return to higher levels as soon as Q2 this year. As Bitcoinist reported, venture capital fund Pantera Capital joined the latter group late last month, releasing a prognosis centering around the 2020 Bitcoin block reward halving as a definitive event for the price of bitcoin.Far ahead of the halving itself, however, executives forecast a knock-effect catalyzing price growth. Based on previous halving data, they argued, bitcoin price could begin reacting this June.More bullish still is Tim Draper, the increasingly infamous Bitcoin champion who had stuck to his mid-term forecast for BTC price hitting as much as $250,000. By 2021, Draper more recently said, \u201ceveryone\u201d would be using the cryptocurrency for micropayments such as coffee purchases.What do you think about the Bitcoin price outlook?

This survey result comes as recent reports claim Russian oligarchs are buying up BTC to bypass US sanctions. One in Three Russians Say Bitcoin is Not ViableThe Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VCIOM) on Tuesday (April 9, 2019) released the result of a public opinion poll on Bitcoin conducted in the country. According to the results, only 36 percent of the 1,600 participants in the poll say Bitcoin investment is not profitable.While about 576 out of the 1,600 participants might think BTC isn\u2019t viable, unconfirmed reports suggest that Russian oligarchs are stockpiling billions of dollars in bitcoin. According to the survey, only about two percent of respondents admitted to ever having purchased the virtual currency.Bitcoin is up more than 40 percent since the start of the year and almost 68 percent since reaching lows of $3,100 in November 2018.Also worth noting, since US sanctions were imposed in 2014, the Russian ruble is down 100 percent against the dollar. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is up 1000 percent against the USD during the same period.BTC Awareness Is Reasonably High in RussiaKeeping with the trend observed in other previous surveys, more than half of the respondents said they had some knowledge of Bitcoin. The results presented by VCIOM on the percentage of Russians who know about Bitcoin (56 percent), is the same recorded in a 2018 survey published by the same organization.Also, 74 percent said they had heard about the term \u2018Bitcoin\u2019 but only nine percent admitted to having more than a basic understanding of it.Similar to other countries like South Korea, millennials are more likely to know about Bitcoin than older generations with the highest concentration in major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg.Only a minor group of participants, about 12 percent, believed that the Kremlin had banned Bitcoin with 16 percent of those who claimed detailed knowledge about bitcoin also holding the same claim. However, 37 percent of the people surveyed express confidence that anyone can acquire bitcoin in Russia.So far, the government hasn\u2019t issued any regulations on cryptocurrency, however. Today, it is not illegal to trade BTC in the country. Meanwhile, the State Duma is in the process of establishing a legal framework for developing virtual currency rules.Do you think the high-level of Bitcoin awareness in Russia will lead to greater BTC adoption in the country?

The majority of the Bitcoin users don\u2019t want to spend the digital gold, at least not yet.15K Merchants Accepting BTC worldwideAt 14,518 as of April 2019, the number of merchants accepting BTC payments is on the rise, with a large concentration in Europe and the U.S. Bitcoin ATMs doubled in 2018 as well to well over 4,000. These have to be good indicators for mass adoption.Although, as it stands right now, there are few people who are interested in buying bitcoins with a 8 percent markup at a Bitcoin ATM, only to then spend it on a sandwich. While the above heatmap is, at first glance, encouraging, just because merchants accept Bitcoin doesn\u2019t mean people want to pay with it. While Bitcoin has found a very strong use case in countries with hyperinflation like Venezuela, HODLers in the West appear to be strictly using it for speculating and as a store of value. OK, so they may buy into the novelty of the \u2018Bitcoin City\u2019, but the sweeping majority simply isn\u2019t going to buy a slice of pizza with bitcoin that could end up being the most expensive meal they\u2019ll ever buy.Crypto-Backed Loans Are a Case in PointThe fact that crypto billionaire Brock Pierce bought a $1.2 million mansion in Amsterdam with a Bitcoin-backed mortgage speaks volumes.A billionaire could easily spend a measly million dollars on a home. But this is one Bitcoin entreprenuer who doesn\u2019t want to sell his assets. And if he\u2019s not using one single satoshi to buy a home, he certainly won\u2019t use them to buy a coffee.Bitcoin City Arnhem an Exciting Idea But\u2026Arnhem in the Netherlands is self-proclaimed as the world\u2019s most Bitcoin-friendly city with the goal:To demonstrate there is an alternative for the current financial system by creating a bitcoin economy.From liquor stores to clothing shops, hotels and restaurants, there are some 114 merchants in Arnhem that accept Bitcoin payments. Pretty cool. In fact, you can stay in the city nestled in the Netherlands and pay entirely with bitcoin if you feel so inclined. You might wish you hadn\u2019t though.Since launching in 2014 to much hype, the number of people spending bitcoin over the years has actually declined in recent years as price skyrockets from a few hundred dollars into the thousands.Since the start of 2019, there have been less than 50 transactions in total.Bitcoinist spoke to one person who preferred to remain anonymous about his experience there. He said:I felt pretty stupid there [in 2015]\u2026 I bought a T-shirt for $30 in BTC\u2026 then the price shot up so, in retrospect, I paid something like $1,000 for it. It isn\u2019t only Arnhem, either. The same source also visited the cosmopolitan capital of Amsterdam on more than one occasion. The first time he went, he got a bike rental shop to accept bitcoin payments by referring the business to a local project there called Bitstraat. It\u2019s now defunct.When he returned two years later, he asked the cashier how BTC payments were going.He says she dusted off the BTC terminal and replied:No one really paid with BTC, maybe one or two people\u2026 I wish I had bought some, though, before the price shot up.Spending BTC in the Developed World Makes Little SenseWhile Bitcoinist is encouraged to see the infrastructure increasing around the world, the reality is that most of bitcoin buyers see it as digital gold. And you don\u2019t see people making fast food purchases with jewelry\u2013least of all in developed countries like the Netherlands. That\u2019s because their card system works perfectly. Database-powered payments are cheap and instant. They don\u2019t have hyperinflation or suffer from the whims of unpredictable despots. Bitcoiners in the west are HODLing Brock Pierce style, and that\u2019s OK.Nevertheless, while BTC is not proving to be a preferred payment method in developed countries the merchant count is growing. It\u2019s easy to accept and costs them nothing to do it. So it\u2019s nice to at least have the option to spend your \u2018hodled\u2019 savings eventually.Do you agree that Bitcoin is serving more as a SoV in developed world?

Afterwards, with a bearish retracement still nowhere to be seen, data from monitoring resource Blockchain.com confirmed that Bitcoin handled its 400 millionth transaction April 8.The giant figure comes as more and more sources begin believing that the overall bear market, which BTC has languished in since December 2017, may have definitively changed. Despite continued price suppression for Q1 2019, network data was already showing signs of a major recovery, Bitcoinist reporting on multiple aspects which have improved of their own accord in recent months. Bitcoin Does Big NumbersAnd it\u2019s not just 400 million; other numbers also make for impressive reading including transferring over $3.2 trillion in value last year alone. Bitcoin\u2019s 24-hour volume according to CoinMarketCap had passed $15 billion at press time \u2013 around 27 percent of the total. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap continues to hover at around half of the overall cryptocurrency market cap. At present, the network is handling just under 400,000 transactions per day. As Bitcoinist reported, this promising yet still relatively low figure constitutes a major hurdle Bitcoin must overcome to continue its exponential growth. Last week, a dedicated report examined how Bitcoin fares compared with extant payment networks which can charge considerably higher fees: Visa, MasterCard, and relative \u2018newcomer\u2019 PayPal. Despite the latter three all currently being able to beat Bitcoin on transaction capacity, advances in scaling solutions will firmly reverse the status quo, the researchers, from software firm DataLight, concluded.In addition, this may not even take too long \u2013 specifically, just ten years, should the current rate of development on solutions such as the Lightning Network continue. \u201cAt the moment, the only factor that hinders quick development of Bitcoin\u2019s network is its upscaling problem,\u201d they concluded, describing the future status of Bitcoin as the \u201cworld\u2019s main payment system.\u201d However, the solution for this problem \u2014 the Lightning network \u2014 is upcoming. This technology will allow Bitcoin to increase its upscaling potential and network bandwidth tenfold.As Bitcoinist frequently notes, Lightning, which is only 15 months into its Bitcoin mainnet implementation, has gained exceptional publicity this year. With names such as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and even a former Miss Universe winner becoming publicly involved, Lightning is taking Bitcoin into the mainstream public consciousness.

For one, the BTC/USD price today is trading over 40 percent higher compared to its mid-December yearly lows.Therefore, Dergunov says now could be \u201can excellent time to build your exposure to bitcoin.\u201d Particularly, after what he calls a \u201cformidable rally\u201d and technical similarities to previous bull-run setups. Therefore, he believes that:\u2026This is very likely only the beginning of Bitcoin\u2019s next bull market.However, as Bitcoin grows more popular, \u201cthe bull market peak is always significantly higher than the previous one,\u201d according to Dergunov.Bitcoin: 99.5% of the Potential Market Still UntappedFinite supply, along with strengthening fundamentals such as rising daily transactions and hash rate (network security), is also what\u2019s making the analyst bullish on BTC \u2014 particularly as a long-term investment.The market capitalization of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies is also still a drop in the ocean compared to traditional markets. This gives Bitcoin huge upside potential especially since it\u2019s unlike any other asset. Dergunov notes: Currently, only about 0.56% of potential users have exposure to Bitcoin, which implies nearly 99.5% of the potential market is still untapped.\u201cBitcoin\u2019s market cap is only $90 billion, and the entire cryptocurrency complex is valued at just $180 billion, while the world\u2019s fiat money supply is worth around $90.4 trillion,\u201d he adds.Bitcoin\u2019s Unique Value PropositionBitcoin and other digital assets, he says, are also attractive because they\u2019re outside the existing financial system.\u2026Bitcoin and other digital assets act as alternative currencies and payment systems relative to the current fiat financial status quo.As Bitcoinist reported, chief investment officer at Ikigai Asset Management, Travis Kling, also believes more people are becoming open to the idea of Bitcoin being hedge against traditional market uncertainties.In fact, what makes Kling \u201cso bullish\u201d on cryptocurrencies is the monetary easing \u201cexperiment\u201d of central banks around the globe. He said:\u2026Look at whats happening with monetary/fiscal policies. And US policy isnt nearly as rekt as EU, Japan & China Close your eyes & imagine the next 5-10 years. Do you really think these policy \u2018experiments\u2019 are going to end well?Thus, the world\u2019s only neutral and borderless protocol for storing and transferring value does offer a unique value proposition \u2014 especially with traditional money becoming increasingly digital and, thus, much easier to control by central authorities.Could the recent BTC price rally be the beginning of the next bull market?

In fact, one expert believes the made-famous-by-Bitcoin technology will be used by upwards of 60 percent of companies. This projection comes from Oracle\u2019s group vice president of blockchain product development, Frank Xiong, who told Forbes CIO Summit that he predicts \u201cbetween 50% and 60% of companies will use blockchain in the next few years.\u201dXiong knows what he\u2019s talking about, too, since Oracle has more than 100 customers using its blockchain platform for the purpose of tracking items.That said, the company vice president is also realistic in his assessment of the technology when he notes that it really isn\u2019t the be-all-end-all solution for business. \u201cWe\u2019re past the stage that blockchain can cure everything,\u201d he told the American business magazine, \u201cso people are becoming more realistic about what\u2019s good for their business model.\u201dBlockchain: Not For EveryoneSamsung SDS vice president in blockchain, Ted Kim, agrees that the nascent-but-growing technology isn\u2019t for everyone. He told Forbes:At the end of the day blockchain makes multipart collaboration more efficient, whether it\u2019s having a consortium to track data on counterfeit getting into supply chains, or how much inventory you need to create a better forecast. There is tangible ROI in the blockchain.Kim\u2019s bullishness on the future of blockchain is more reigned in than Xiong\u2019s. The former expects 20 percent of companies to use blockchain technology in three years.Keeping The Status QuoOf course, the possibility exists that decentralized blockchain technology will essentially just get co-opted by centralized companies, and the promise of freedom will be forgotten. Noted Bext360 CEO Daniel Jones:People are predicting that the blockchain will allow people to be decentralized, that everyone will have distributed trusted networks.

Obtaining a BitLicense is undoubtedly good news for the traditionally European-focused Bitstamp, which will now find it easier to make inroads into the United States cryptocurrency trading ecosystem and expand its presence in the large North American market.

Obtaining a BitLicense is a key element in ramping up our presence in the United States, especially when it comes to working with institutional investors.Acquiring a BitLicense is no easy feat in the restrictive state of New York. In order to obtain the somewhat-coveted permission slip, companies must adhere to a slew of strict requirements relating to consumer protection.Many individuals in the cryptocurrency space are critical of the BitLicense \u2014 and for good reason. However, Bitstamp claims that the license essentially validates its operation as operating under the \u201csame high standards followed by traditional financial institutions.\u201d Notes the company:Since we opened our doors in 2011, we\u2019ve strived to not only be the most secure and trusted crypto exchange in the world, but to shape new frontiers for the industry by developing best practices in security and self-regulation. We look forward to carrying the lessons we\u2019ve learned in Europe over the ocean and helping to develop a better environment for all crypto businesses, both in the US and worldwide.Bitstamp was rumored to be close to finalizing a deal for the sale of the company to a South Korean gaming company nearly one year ago \u2014 but little information regarding the rumors followed.What do you think of Bitstamp and New York\u2019s infamous BitLicense?

After a slight reversal, momentum reappeared to take the pair above $5000 and hold it in an area around $5200 ever since. This, while delighting many who are eager to call a definitive \u2018bottom\u2019 in bitcoin price, has led to uneven spreads across exchanges. As Bitcoinist reported, it was China that led the trend this month, with the country\u2019s traders paying extra for acquiring stablecoin Tether (USDT), their main entry point into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a highly restricted market. South Korea\u2019s Kimchi Premium, which presents as a markup on Bitcoin price asks directly, is now following suit, leading some to draw comparisons to previous bullish Bitcoin activity.The pattern first emerged in late 2017 as BTC/USD aimed for its all-time high over $20,000. Thereafter, the Premium came and went, most recently last October, before Bitcoin\u2019s descent to recent lows of $3100.BTCKRW: Korean premium is appearing again.

This represents a markup of around 1.5 percent.Woo Analysis Suggests Bottom Is InMeanwhile, further evidence bitcoin price may have bottomed out in the past months has come from independent analyst Willy Woo. In an update to his Woobull blog, Woo extended his Bitcoin price measurements in an attempt to place its recent lows in context. His latest metric, Cumulative Value Days Destroyed (CVDD), focuses on transactions, and is remarkably accurate when applied to previous bear market lows.\u201cWhen a HODLer sells to another HODLer the transaction contains both value (USD) and a length of prior HODL time,\u201d he explained. CVDD is the cumulative sum of this value and time destruction for every on-chain transaction (adjusted by age of market which brings the units back into USD).If Woo is correct, the latest bottom should already be behind Bitcoin, with the surge above $5000 the start of a fresh longer-term uptrend. As Bitcoinist noted, however, not everyone is convinced, with veteran trader Tone Vays this week leading calls to treat the latest Bitcoin price performance with skepticism.

His bitcoin stash likely keeps him warm at night. Jack Dorsey Gets Paid $1.40 as Twitter CEOAccording to the Washington Post, an SEC filing published on Monday (April 8, 2019) shows that Twitter paid Dorsey an annual salary of $1.40 in 2018. The sum is most likely a nod to the platform\u2019s previous 140-character limit for posts.Dorsey\u2019s other company \u2013 Square, reportedly paid him a $2.75 salary for 2017. This figure is also symbolic as 2.75 percent is the company\u2019s processing fee on swiped transactions.It\u2019s a common trend for tech billionaires to pass up on their annual salary since they have massive equity stakes in their companies. Thus, they accept only a tiny salary while collecting huge compensations tied to the performance of their companies.According to Twitter\u2019s filing notes, Dorsey declined compensation upon his re-appointment as company CEO in 2015. It should be pointed out that the Twitter CEO does own about 2.3 percent of the company\u2019s stock and is worth an estimated $4.7 billion.Dorsey\u2019s Bitcoin StashWhile base annual salaries are a token for people like Dorsey, the Twitter CEO\u2019s Bitcoin stake makes the need for them even more inconsequential. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, Dorsey has recently been purchasing $10,000 worth of bitcoin every week.While no one knows how much BTC Doraey owns, Bitcoin is up nearly 40 percent since the start of the year. Most of that growth has been due to its April 2019 performance. Therefore, it\u2019s safe to say Dorsey\u2019s stash is doing pretty well, especially over the past month.Dorsey Bullish on BitcoinDorsey continues to be bullish on Bitcoin. Appearing on the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast earlier in the year, the CEO doubled-down on his previously espoused view that Bitcoin could be the native currency of the Internet.Bought these Minecraft Legos with bitcoin and @cashapp here in Tokyo for Biz\u2019s son Jake pic.twitter.com/0qDqvq5Czh\u2014 jack (@jack) March 25, 2019Apart from talking up BTC, the Twitter and Square CEO has also been visible on the Bitcoin technology front. Back in March, Dorsey showed off his Casa Bitcoin full node after earlier announcing the imminent integration of Lightning Network on the Square Cash App.Dorsey also plans to contribute to the development of the cryptocurrency ecosystem announcing that he will hire developers to work on open source crypto technology projects. What\u2019s more, the Twitter chief says he will pay the people who work on these projects in Bitcoin.Apart Dorsey, do you think other tech billionaires are keeping part of their wealth in Bitcoin?

Institutions Warming UpPopular cryptocurrency data outlet Diar reports that institutional Bitcoin trading volumes have moved into growth for the 4th consecutive month. According to the report, they are hitting new highs against US-based exchanges as a percentage of the total trading volume.As seen on the chart, the current volume is around 9 percent more compared to December 2018.Notably, CBOE is the biggest loser, which doesn\u2019t come much as a surprise. The Chicago Board Options Exchange revealed in March that it will no longer offer any new contracts for its cash-settled XBT Bitcoin futures product moving forward.CME Group, on the other hand, is marking gains. As Bitcoinist reported last week, CME Bitcoin futures volume soared 950 percent on April 4th compared to the beginning of the month. As of Monday, April 8th, CME saw around 16,000 Bitcoin futures contract.Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) which is traded on OTC markets has also lost dominance. The report outlines that GBTC has accounted for over 50 percent of the entire market share when it comes to institutional products but it is now standing in less than 24 percent.Declining Price Didn\u2019t Affect Institutional DemandBitcoin has gone through a 15-month bear market, which dragged Bitcoin\u2019s price down to yearly lows of around $3,200 from an all-time high of $20,000. In other words, the cryptocurrency is down around 85 percent from its peak.According to Diar\u2019s report, however, the decline in value failed to translate into more institutional demand, perhaps hinting that price isn\u2019t such a prominent factor for institutions.In any case, the rising interest in institutional Bitcoin trading products could be interpreted as a bullish sign. However, veteran trading expert Tone Vays has warned that Bitcoin\u2019s recent rally doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the bear is over.Others, however, have suggested that price may have bottomed as it\u2019s now resembling a pattern seen prior to the previous bull-run if not a new parabolic advance.What do you think of the growth marked by institutional Bitcoin trading products?

The impact, he argued, does not have to be a negative one. \u201cBlocks WILL be full sooner or later. We\u2019re not making smart use of block space, so we\u2019re likely to experience a bumpy fee ride until people adjust their behavior,\u201d he wrote.\u2026It costs miners virtually nothing to add a transaction. Block space is given to the highest bidder \u2013 if nobody bids, it\u2019s practically free. If you think mass replicated immutable blockchain data is at least worth something, then it logically follows that blocks WILL be full.The topic of Bitcoin transaction fees has returned to the spotlight over the past week after Bitcoin price shot up to $5300 in a matter of days. A surge in network activity followed, with fees rising as blocks suddenly became fuller. As Bitcoinist reported, the change led to criticism of certain players, such as wallets which are not helping decrease network load. Somsen agreed.\u201cWallets need to get smarter,\u201d he continued. Fee estimates aim for the next block by default. The result? A bidding war. Better to use Replace-By-Fee (RBF) + under-bidding and automated fee bumps to get a cheaper confirmation within a user-defined time limit. This smooths out the fees.Off-Chain No Magic Bullet?He added upcoming technological improvements, in the form of Schnorr signatures, Taproot, MAST, MuSig and SigAgg, would also help keep fees under control, but that the wholesale rollout of these tools was still a long way off.9/9 Does this sound complex? It is. There's simply no other way for Bitcoin to stay trustless. If you personally don't need trustlessness, you can always transact cheaply off-chain via third parties. But if we sacrifice trustlessness on the base layer, it'll be gone forever\u2026\ud83d\ude1e\u2014 Ruben Somsen \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\udd7e\ufe0f2\ufe0f\u20e3\u274e (@SomsenRuben) April 10, 2019On the topic of off-chain scaling, something many believe will ultimately avoid the need to pay significant network fees, Somsen also gave cautionary advice.\u201c\u2026All off-chain solutions, whether it\u2019s third party services or Lightning, do NOT make you immune to on-chain fees,\u201d he countered. \u201cWhen there are issues, people have to go back on-chain. If you can\u2019t afford to pay the fee, you are stuck and won\u2019t be able to exit from misbehavior.\u201dHe concludes:There\u2019s simply no other way for Bitcoin to stay trustless. If you personally don\u2019t need trustlessness, you can always transact cheaply off-chain via third parties. But if we sacrifice trustlessness on the base layer, it\u2019ll be gone forever.Lightning itself remains a technology in its infancy, despite mounting publicity from well-known figures from both within and beyond cryptocurrency. Considered an experiment on a technical level, Lightning currently contains capacity for just under 1100 BTC ($5.79 million) in transactions, a figure which has nonetheless shot up 40 percent over the past month alone.What do you think about Ruben Somsen\u2019s prognosis?

The research also highlighted the highly correlated nature of the virtual currency market due to the \u201cherd mentality\u201d that emerges during the late bull/early bear phases.Data Points Towards Bitcoin Bottoming in 2018According to the details of the research published on Thursday (April 11, 2019), the steady recovery of cryptocurrency prices from their 2018 lows points to the belief that the market has bottomed out.Since the start of the year, Bitcoin is up more than 40 percent with three-quarter of that growth happening in April 2019. Before the Bitcoin breakout that occurred in early April, altcoins had been experiencing massive gains as well leading to term \u201caltseason.\u201dAn excerpt from the report reads:Having emerged from a period of the highest internal correlations in crypto history, the data may support the notion that the cryptomarket has already bottomed out.Since Bitcoin fell in early 2018 from $17,000 all the way down to $6,000 analysts have been calling a price bottom. Throughout 2018, these calls turned out to be inaccurate with the price taking a further dip in mid-November to reach $3,100.However, since the latest bullish breakout, talk of the Bitcoin bottom has become re-ignited. Analysts like Brian Kelly of BKCM LLC have expressed confidence of the mid-November crash being Bitcoin\u2019s long-term bottom on the road to another bullish phase.Cryptocurrencies Remain Highly CorrelatedOne of the major talking points of the Binance research was the degree to which cryptocurrencies are correlated with each other. The report declared that the internal correlation of cryptocurrency prices increased during the bear market of 2018.Citing the co-movement phenomenon (also called \u201cherding effect\u201d), the report suggested that the irrational behavior of retail investors and the nascent nature of the market, in general, contributed greatly to the high internal correlation of cryptos.Another profound observation highlighted in the report was the relationship between altcoin correlation in USD and Bitcoin price action. Using data from February 2014 to March 2019, the research team discovered that high periods of high altcoin correlation [between 0.8 and 1] corresponded to a trend reversal for Bitcoin.The report did, however, include a caveat which states:Given the short history of the crypto market, it may be premature to say that there is a causal relationship between peaks in correlation and market reversals, or if it\u2019s actually a herding effect during the market reversals themselves.Crypto Market Resembles Chinese Stock MarketIn trying to explain the co-movement phenomenon, the Binance research compared the investor matrix of the cryptocurrency market with that of mainstream stock exchanges in different countries.The research team discovered that both the crypto market and China\u2019s stock exchange did have significantly higher turnovers \u2013 a phenomenon the researchers linked to the proportion of retail investors in both markets.Like the cryptocurrency market, retail investors dominate the Chinese stock market with their numbers standing at 99.8 percent in 2018. According to the report, retail traders also accounted for 80 percent of the trading volume in China\u2019s stock market for 2018.Explaining the link between a higher proportion of retail traders and the propensity for higher turnovers occasioned by herd mentality, the report says:Generally speaking, non-professional investors are prone to becoming overconfident or overly pessimistic in reacting to market trends, leading to higher potential transaction volume, more volatile prices, as reported in numerous studies.Hodling Occurs Most During Bear Market PeriodsThe Binance research also concluded that Bitcoin holders tended to \u201chodl\u201d during bear markets only becoming active during significant bullish breakouts.Using the \u201crealized cap\u201d metric, the researchers discovered only minimal changes in UTXO market capitalization during prolonged periods of downward price action.As previously reported by Bitcoinist, Tom Lee of Fundstrat says that Bitcoin bulls who have kept their powder dry since late 2017, are staging a return to the scene, buying up bitcoin.Do you agree that Bitcoin bottomed out in November 2018h?

Let\u2019s dive into the charts to see if the bulls can maintain the momentum to take us higher.Bitcoin Price Trend Points to $5,900Looking at the 4-hour chart, we can see that bitcoin price is steadily climbing higher since the memorable move to breach $5k last week.The range for the week thus far, has been quite tight, with lows of $5130 and highs of $5320. Wednesday has seen BTC/USD maintain the range equilibrium and sustained $5200, all while occurring within an ascending triangle pattern.The upside target of this triangle, as unbelievable as it would sound only a couple of weeks ago, would be almost $5900.Looking at the technical indicators, the bullish cross on the stochastic RSI from oversold territory implies that there is room to the upside. As we have seen this in critical recent times, it has preceded the more significant moves higher over the past couple of weeks.There is, however, bearish divergence on the MACD and the RSI, where the indicators are trending lower while price is trending higher. This normally implies that there is a weakening move. However, at face value, the price action suggests that the bulls want to take BTC higher.Could BTC follow LTC?As we know, Bitcoin has generally lagged behind the other altcoins in taking a move higher and although it took its time, it did ultimately follow.Looking at where bitcoin price currently is and how it is performing, there is unquestionable similarities between how it broke form its lows and pressed higher.So would it be that unreasonable for Bitcoin to do the same? Well we know that there is a lot of people who want to buy the dip back in the low $4000s and mid $3500s. There are also still a few people who anticipate bitcoin price fall below $3000 to $2000 if not lower.People Waiting on Cheaper Bitcoin is BullishIt may just be that what we have witnessed is simply excess demand over supply, which is what actually led to the breakout in the first place. Clearly there will be a corrective phase at some point, but with so much desire to buy lower, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that BTC price could go higher.Seriously why is no one talking about this gox news?\u2014 steve (@btcfeen) April 10, 2019One catalyst could be the news of the Mt Gox coins, which were at risk of being released back to the market some time this summer, is now likely to be postponed.

Slowing global economic growth coupled with governments\u2019 relentless interventions are eroding central banks\u2019 independence around the world.1. Trump Makes the Fed Look Stupidly Un-IndependentEver since his presidency began, Trump has been on a mission to gain greater control of the Central Bank. He\u2019s already placed four out of seven board members and nominated a further two.However, according to the Fitch report, this government intervention sets a dangerous precedent\u2013in the U.S. and around the world.Global Head of Sovereign Ratings at Fitch James McCormack adds that Central Banks are:being increasingly viewed by governments as ripe for a broadening of their remit.He adds that now is the time for investors to think deeply about what a global recession and greater pressure from governments on central banks to support economic growth could mean for their portfolios.Fitch believes investors would be wise to consider the potential implications of mounting political pressures for greater contributions from monetary policy to support economic growth, possibly by unconventional means.It\u2019s becoming obvious that tightening of monetary policy amid slowing growth is failing to halt the impending economic downturn. Most Central Banks around the world are beginning to reduce or retract on interest rate hikes against heavy criticism from world leaders:REMINDER: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney\u2019s apology for previous inaccurate dire warnings re Brexit\u2026 https://t.co/JEDoJOGbGi\u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) November 28, 2018The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don\u2019t have a feel for the Market, they don\u2019t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can\u2019t score because he has no touch \u2013 he can\u2019t putt!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2018MMT (Modern Monetary Theory) is also gaining traction. MMT proponents believe that Central Banks should create their own base money rather than regulating the economy through interest rates. However, few times over the course of history has printing money been a good idea.2. He\u2019s Appointing Pro-Bitcoin Staff in High PlacesNot only does Trump continue to urge the Fed to keep easing, but he\u2019s also appointing pro-Bitcoiners in very high places. Mick Mulvaney\u2019s recent appointment as Budget Director could be extremely bullish for Bitcoin. His knowledge of the digital currency goes way back and he was instrumental in educating people inside Washington about Bitcoin and blockchain technology.Mulvaney even co-created a bi-partisan initiative called Blockchain Caucus to act as a discussion center for ways to incorporate blockchain technology in the national government.While his spending policy and ideas for Social Security may be at odds with Trump, it\u2019s likely that any regulation surrounding Bitcoin will be positive while Mulvaney is in office. If he lasts longer than most of the president\u2019s appointees, that is.3. Economic Uncertainty is the Perfect Storm for BitcoinTrump and other world leaders continue to bash their Central Banks while leaning on them for further funding. This uncontrollable spending and economic turmoil is inadvertently creating the perfect storm for Bitcoin.After all, political discord, economic instability, and the demising power of central banks are all conditions that favor the adoption of Bitcoin. Its immutable ledger and particularly the inability of anyone to change the rules makes it the most politically-neutral form of money that ever existed. This makes Bitcoin unlike any other \u2018asset\u2019 that existed before \u2013 which explains why it thrives in times of political instability and economic turmoil.As Max Keiser commented in a previous interview with Bitcoinist:Bitcoin adoption has always been driven by bank failures, bailouts, bail-ins, and political unrest.So, carry on the interventions and bring on the global recession, Bitcoin will rise from the ashes as the way forward once more.Will Bitcoin benefit from the erosion of The Fed\u2019s independence?

Bitcoinist | Apr 10, 2019 | 13:00 Share Tweet Send Share Gonna shake things up a bit today. There\u2019s a lot going on in crypto so I\u2019d like to get the traditional markets bit out of the way quickly up here before diving into crypto land. As we know, crypto does not exist in a bubble and external factors often influence prices. So even if you are currently ignoring my multiple messages to diversify into many different markets, this stuff is still relevant for you.First off, it\u2019s important to note that the IMF has just joined the WTO and countless other organizations in downgrading their forecast for global growth this year due to trade concerns. Most notable was that they actually upgraded their outlook on China.Also buzzing in the market is the news that Uber is going to be doing an IPO next month!!The company has been holding back from a public offering for a very long time, leading many to questions, why, especially right after the gargantuan flop that was the Lyft IPO, would they go public at this very moment?Does it possibly have to do with the increasing number of economists who feel that we\u2019re at the end of one of the longest stock bull cycles in history?Also, look out for the ECB\u2019s announcement today as well as the Fed in the USA. We can probably expect nothing less than their full support for this fragile market.@Matigreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsI\u2019ve got the Torch!!China to Ban Crypto MiningTokenized LawPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of April 10th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Lightning TorchThe invention of blockchain for the first time allows us to transfer value or a token that represents something of value, from one party to another through the internet without the need of a middle man. Futurists are already predicting how this will affect the way that the internet works and pointing out its vast implication for the redistribution of wealth.One interesting digital item that has been created displays this ability very well, the bitcoin lightening trust chain torch. What started as a simple game to test bitcoin\u2019s lightning network, has evolved into something a bit bigger.We covered the LN Trust chain game back when it was handled by the CEO of Square and Twitter, Jack Dorsey. Today, I wanted to update that the torch is at this very moment safely in my possession.Will be passing it off sometime this evening, though I\u2019m still not sure to who. I want to thank Jonha Richman who passed it to me, to you my readers and social media connections, and to eToro for giving me this humble platform.The chain has just two more passes (hops) until the money accumulated will be passed to aid the people of Venezuela. So far, crypto has been a critical way to help the people there, as can be demonstrated by a report found on Reddit this morning.China Bans Bitcoin MiningNot again?!\u2026 Was the exact sentiment on social media when this announcement came out yesterday and as we can clearly see by the reaction from bitcoin\u2019s price, or lack thereof, the news is being taken with a grain of salt.The article, that seemed to originate from Reuters but was soon spread throughout MSM, seemed to indicate that a total ban on all crypto mining in China would soon go into effect. As China is estimated to contribute more than 70% of the networks\u2019 hash power, this does seem concerning.However, the timeframe is still unclear. We know that the Chinese government has given until May 7th for the public to respond, but that\u2019s about it. China\u2019s strategy has been to slowly weed out crypto mining over the course of many years and the report cited in the Reuters article doesn\u2019t seem to indicate any change to that strategy.The thing is, bitcoin was specifically designed to work independently of governments and financial institutions. So even if China does decide to close all their mining farms today, Bitcoin would be just fine. A sudden drop in hash power would simply make it more profitable for others to join the mining industry.In my view, over time the hashrate will continue to grow as other countries invest further in their mining operations and technological advances increase the energy efficiency of mining rigs. In fact, the loss of cheap Chinese electricity in the network could very well increase the average cost to mine a bitcoin, thereby possibly even pushing the price of bitcoin higher.A New ActIt should be noted that the much hailed Token Taxonomy Act has been resubmitted before the US Congress. This bill has been praised by industry insiders in the past but this time it seems to be under a bit of pressure.As pointed out by Caitlin Long, the current version that was proposed yesterday, is a bit different from the previous one and does not do as good a job at defining which tokens are considered securities and which are not.In any case, the reintroduction of the bill seems to be a positive step forward but at this point, almost everyone agrees that further work is needed.Apologies for the lack of graphs today. I\u2019m actually writing to you from the hospital as my wife is now in labor.

The date coincides with the latest bitcoin price rally when it soared from around $4,100 to more than $5,300 in minutes. Smart Money Goes Long on BitcoinData from the US CFTC reveals that the number of opened long Bitcoin futures contracts by asset managers and institutional investors on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) increased between March 26th on April 2nd.Notably, 315 long Bitcoin futures contracts on CME\u2019s platform were opened by April 2nd. This is a whopping 88 percent increase compared to the previous week. Moreover, the number of short positions saw a 63 percent decrease \u2013 from 241 to 89 contracts.Each CME Bitcoin futures contract represents 5 BTC, which are cash-settled. This means that once the contract expires, the user won\u2019t receive a physically-delivered Bitcoin but US dollars instead.Another thing to note is that the total number of opened long and short positions on CME on that date was 404. From those, 78 percent were long, while only 22 percent were short.This change in sentiment could be signalling that insitutional investors are now turning bullish on Bitcoin as interest is on the upswing.Bitcoinist reported that institutional Bitcoin trading volume has continued to grow for 4 consecutive months. So far in April, it appears that most of the smart money is betting on bitcoin to rise in value. CME Group is mainly responsible for the increase, especially after the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) announced back in March that it won\u2019t offer any new Bitcoin futures contracts.Meanwhile, BTC/USD 00 is up almost 40 percent from its mid-December price lows.It\u2019s Not Just InstitutionsThe latest Bitcoin rally has seemingly changed the bearish sentiment amid retail traders as well.Data from TradingView shows that the number of long positions on cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex also increased over the past five days.On the other hand, the number of short positions has decreased substantially. This suggests that sentiment flipped bullish on April 8th, which is also when long positions surged.Meanwhile, independent analyst Willy Woo has come up with an analysis that suggests that the prolonged bear market may be coming to an end. The surge above $5,000 marks the beginning of a new longer-term uptrend.The bullish sentiment is further echoed by veteran trader Peter Brandt. He\u2019s known for calling Bitcoin\u2019s last parabolic advance at $20,000, while also predicting an 80 percent decline to under $4,000.Brandt has recently said that it wouldn\u2019t surprise him if \u201cBTC enters a new parabolic phase.\u201dAre institutions driving the bitcoin price rally?

Large IPOs such as Uber\u2019s and others could bring spectacular benefits to the crypto industry. At the same time, business solutions allowing Uber users to pay with Bitcoin are now moving to center stage.Uber IPO: Bigger Than Bitcoin\u2019s Market CapOn April 11, 2019, Uber filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer shares of its common stock. In its recently released prospectus, Uber does not mention the magnitude of the IPO, which could be one of the biggest ever.However, according to The Financial Times,The company is aiming to raise $10bn from its IPO and recently told some of its investors that it could be valued at $90bn to $100bn, according to people familiar with the matter. The company was last valued at $76bn in a private fundraising in August.Thus, the estimated valuation would surpass today\u2019s Bitcoin market capitalization of about $89 billion.The transportation company bases its projections on its leading technology, expertise, and massive network, which comprises millions of drivers, users, shippers, and other participants around the globe.Moreover, Uber details in its prospectus financial data as follows:Revenue derived from our Ridesharing products grew from $3.5 billion in 2016 to $9.2 billion in 2018.Gross Bookings derived from our Ridesharing products grew from $18.8 billion in 2016 to $41.5 billion in 2018.Consumers traveled approximately 26 billion miles on our platform in 2018.Uber has become omnipresent. Its global ridesharing footprint covers 63 countries, encompassing a population of over 4 billion people, as shown in the graph below:Digital Currency Group CEO, Barry Silbert adds that billions of dollars in private company stock will be unleashed from IPOs this year.\u201cThe crypto asset class is going to be a huge beneficiary,\u201d he saysYou Can Already Use BitcoinUber\u2019s direct acceptance of payments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may still be a long way off, however.In the meantime though, some Uber drivers around the world are unofficially accepting BTC instead of their local fiat currency.Some users in Argentina, for example, have expressed interest in paying for Uber with bitcoin while some drivers wouldn\u2019t mind receiving some bits instead of the depreciating peso.For instance, an Uber driver, under the Reddit username bjandrus, wrote that he was already accepting bitcoin off the books for rides. However, he complains, the process is problematic because the Uber app does not support BTC payments.It remains to be seen which ride-sharing company will officially begin accepting bitcoin first.However, paying for Uber in bitcoin indirectly is already possible. For example, there\u2019s the gift card option from Bitrefill and others, including the Coinbase e-gift card supported in select EU countries and Australia.There are also third-party services as well as cryptocurrency debit cards that allow you to pay for anything, including Uber, Lyft etc. using bitcoin.https://twitter.com/VenditExchange/status/1088929593577357313How do you think IPOs such the one expected from Uber could benefit the crypto industry?

Minimal Bitcoin Exposure, Maximum GainsIn an essay published by Kana and Katana back in March 2019, the Xapo chief laid down an argument for Bitcoin to take up one percent of every investment portfolio. According to Casares, a $10 million with a one percent allocation to BTC could yield close to $25 million within seven to ten years.Casares based his analysis on his forecast that BTC could top $1 million within the stated timeframe. Conversely, if Bitcoin fails, the portfolio would only have lost the original one percent \u2013 $100,000.According to Casares:Bitcoin offers a unique opportunity for a non-material exposure to produce a material outcome. It would be irresponsible to have an exposure to Bitcoin that one cannot afford to lose because the risk of losing the principal is very real. But it would be almost as irresponsible to not have any exposure at all.Investment legend, Biller Miller is a popular example of Casares\u2019 logic. In July 2017, Miller took up a one percent position on BTC. By mid-December 2017, BTC accounted for 50 percent of Miller\u2019s total asset under management, simply because BTC/USD gained almost 700 percent in value during that period.An investing legend is making a killing after putting 1% of his net worth in bitcoin https://t.co/wz7rUqPIBe via @themoneygame\u2014 Wences Casares (@wences) July 20, 2017The 2018 bear market probably, reduced Bitcoin\u2019s proportion with respect to the rest of Miller\u2019s portfolio. However, with BTC price still double what it was in July 2017, Miller\u2019s bitcoin bag is still in the green.Bitcoin Resembles the Early InternetFor Casares, whose company stores over $10 billion in BTC for clients in Swiss \u2018bunkers,\u2019 the signs pointing towards Bitcoin\u2019s long-term success continue to become evident as time passes. For one, the Xapo chief says Bitcoin resembles the early internet in many ways.Casares highlighted how since the establishment of the Internet, the world has seen little of protocol developments and with more emphasis on creating companies. Bitcoin, according to the Xapo CEO represents a new paradigm-altering protocol that could have even greater ramifications than the Internet.Coming from a purely technical standpoint, Casares does agree that there exists the possibility that Bitcoin might not necessarily fail, but become obsolete. He says companies could create solutions on a protocol level that appeal more to users than Bitcoin\u2019s current state.Casares has previously made expressed similar sentiments, describing Bitcoin as an intellectual experiment that could still fail.However, Bitcoin\u2019s leaderless open-source and borderless approach to both its tech and economics are diminishing this possibility alongside its ever-growing network effect and first-mover advantage.Meanwhile, there is a growing unease with the policies of governments and central banks that are making BTC become an even more attractive proposition to investors as a hedge.Forget Altcoins, BTC is the Real DealCasares also adds that the other over 2,000 altcoins don\u2019t stand a chance. The Xapo CEO says Bitcoin as a protocol is already on its way to succeeding in ways altcoins can\u2019t.Elaborating on the gulf in utility and adoption, Casares noted:Over 60 million people own Bitcoin and over 1 million people become new owners every month. The other 1,000 cryptocurrencies [that process at least one transaction per day] have less than 5 million owners combined, so Bitcoin will add more users in the next 5 months than those 1,000 cryptocurrencies added in their combined history.Back in August 2018, Casares declared that altcoins will eventually face a \u201cmass extinction event.\u201d Commentators like Matt Hougan of Bitwise and Barry Silbert of Digital Currency group also believe that most altcoins will not survive the crypto version of the dot-com bubble bursting. After which, most altcoins will go to zero.Bitcoin\u2019s superiority becomes even more apparent given that its value transfer dwarfs all cryptocurrencies despite having fewer BTC transactions per day than some altcoins.Should investment portfolios consider taking up a one percent position on Bitcoin?

This is the peak popularity for this particular term in the selected period.On the same date, Bitcoin was trading at around $5,300, which marked a considerable increase of around 26 percent from two days prior, when it was trading at around $4,200.On the other hand, comparing both charts also shows us that the interest in buying bitcoin decreases if the price declines.Signs of FOMOIn other words, it appears that people are more willing to buy bitcoin at times when it\u2019s trending higher, rather than when it\u2019s trending downwards.As Bitcoinist reported, this might indicate that people are just tempting to not miss out on a further increase in the price, otherwise known as the fear of missing out (FOMO). The fact that the interest in buying bitcoin declines when the price is plunging is perhaps another indicator supporting this type of behavior.Additionally, the top 5 countries where Bitcoin searches tripled in popularity following the rally were Nigeria, Netherlands, South Africa, Austria, and Switzerland.Or Signs of a Bottom?On the other hand, proponents have made the point that BTC/USD may have finally bottomed out.A new report by leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance revealed that the steady recovery of cryptocurrency prices following their 2018 lows to the belief that the market has reached its bottom.In any case, the upward potential of Bitcoin is notable, as the block reward halving is now just 405 days away. Moreover, it is digitally scarce while its emission rate is transparent and predictable unlike that of the US dollar or other fiat currencies for that matter. The latter is steadily losing its purchasing power and it will continue doing so.Buy low, sell high, goes the saying.So with the BTC price 00 again showing bullish signs, there could be a few reasons to scoop up some bitcoin now. Because if Google data is anything to go by, the vast majority of people will likely buy bitcoin at $30,000 and higher rather than at a \u2018low\u2019 of $3,000.Do most people tend to buy high and sell low?

As Bitcoinist reported, the moves form part of a trend which accelerated in many places in line with Bitcoin price climbing steeply earlier this month. As with the previous week, it was Venezuela, Peru, Mexico, Kazakhstan and others leading the way over the past seven days, Localbitcoins data confirms. The period to April 13 was especially successful for Mexico, which set a new all-time trading record of 10.67 million pesos ($568,000) on Localbitcoins.The peak contrasts sharply with the previous week, in which 8.6 million changed hands, and just clipped the previous record of 10.62 million set in March 2018.Topping the list of motivations for the behavior remains US foreign policy, president Donald Trump threatening to target traditional fiat-based remittance channels. This, Bitcoinist explained, opens up the door to Bitcoin as an alternative.A glance at other jurisdictions tracked by CoinDance tells a similar story, while Venezuela joined Mexico in beating all its previous weekly records. In terms of the country\u2019s highly-volatile fiat currency, the Sovereign Bolivar (VES), last week saw the equivalent of 30 billion units trade across Localbitcoins, beating the previous all-time high of 26.4 billion set the week before.Kazakhstan, Tanzania Get Taste For BitcoinBeyond South America, as before, Kazakhstan continued its trading boom, also setting higher volumes last week than ever before \u2013 55 million tenge ($145,000).The uptick accompanies political upheaval in the Central Asian country, after veteran president Nursultan Nazarbayev unexpectedly quit his office last month. In a fresh wave of interest, Tanzania also produced recent highs, with 165 million shillings ($71,000) across Localbitcoins. The country\u2019s all-time high of 294 million from April last year, however, remains intact.As Bitcoinist noted, the Bitcoin price surge also led to the reemergence of other Bitcoin financial phenomena. Focused on Asia, both Chinese and South Korean buyers began paying fiat premiums for cryptocurrency this month. In China, over-the-counter purchasers of stablecoin Tether (USDT), from which they can diversify into other assets, faced higher CNY prices than their USD counterparts.South Korean exchanges meanwhile saw the return of the so-called \u2018Kimchi Premium,\u2019 a mark-up for Bitcoin and other assets in won terms which last week averaged around 1.5 percent. According to data from CoinMarketCap, overall 24-hour trading volumes for Bitcoin on regular exchanges totalled approximately $10.9 billion Monday.

An excerpt from the statement reads:At Binance, we periodically review each digital asset we list to ensure that it continues to meet the high level of standard we expect. When a coin or token no longer meets this standard, or the industry changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it.

Additional data published by BitMEX shows that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has mined more coins than BSV since the split.Back in November 2018, disagreements in the Bitcoin Cash developer community caused a hard fork, which led the BCH chain to split into two different coins.The November hash war turned out to be bitterly contested by both parties with entities on both sides adopting kamikaze-esque tactics, which ultimately led to significant losses on both sides.Data from BitMEX Research from November 19, 2018, shows BSV miners incurring a total loss of $1.4 million, a negative gross margin of over 350 percent.Many commentators also believe that the BCH civil war caused the mid-November 2018 crash that saw bitcoin price (BTC) to fall from $6,000 to $3,100.I normally don't like get involved in debates, pick sides, etc. But this is going too far.I also didn't like the fact that the fork caused BTC to drop below $6k, which caused pain to many in the industry.\u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) April 12, 2019Delist BSV: Price Takes a BeatingIt is no secret that BCH has fared better than BSV since the end of the hash war.

Christina Comben | Apr 15, 2019 | 09:00 Share Tweet Send Share If you\u2019re still asking \u201cwhen are taxes due?\u201d this morning, today may be a tough one for you. Sorry Bitcoin HODLers and traders, your tax returns deadline is today, April 15.Bitcoin: When Are Taxes Due and Where to Start?Like many things surrounding Bitcoin, Bitcoin taxes are still somewhat shrouded in mystery. However, complicated as they may be, a quick Google search should help you navigate your way through the maze.There are a few common misconceptions about Bitcoin taxes. The first being that there is no tax on virtual currency. If you\u2019re with the 51 percent of HODLers polled last year and think that the IRS will never catch you, you may be in for a shock. Even small-time traders who conceal earnings may wish they hadn\u2019t if they resurface later.Ok US people, crypto taxes:\u2014 Ryan Selkis (@twobitidiot) April 1, 2018The IRS published guidelines on Bitcoin taxes back in 2014. The key takeaways are that Bitcoin earnings are not tax-free and that they\u2019re viewed in the same class as an investment property, not an actual currency. This means you report your Bitcoin earnings the same way as you would with stocks, bonds, and other investments. So you need to declare every operation to the IRS\u2013when you buy, sell, use or earn Bitcoin. You can read more in-depth advice on Bitcoin taxes from a Bitcoin tax accountant here. But for the sake of speed (after all your tax return is due today April 15), you\u2019ll need to pay tax every time you made a profit on Bitcoin. Say, for example, that you bought $1,000 worth of BTC. The market picked up and you sold the same amount for $1,500. You pay capital gains tax your $500 profit.Record All Your Bitcoin TransactionsIf you woke up today thinking about Bitcoin and asking when are taxes due, the chances are you haven\u2019t been keeping a log of all your transactions. If that\u2019s the case, go through all your exchange and wallet records, at least, the ones that you can remember. Moving forward, if you want to avoid a fine from the IRS, keep a report of all transactions. For today, download the 8949 form, fill out as much as you can, and turn it in.Small-time traders currently need to keep their own logs. Coinbase, for example, will only issue a 1099-K form for traders who placed over 200 orders accounting for at least $20,000. That doesn\u2019t apply to many Bitcoin hobbyists.There\u2019s still a somewhat \u201cthey can\u2019t catch me\u201d sentiment among some traders. But, the IRS is getting more informed about Bitcoin all the time. Last year, for example, a very small fraction of people reported capital gains on their Bitcoin. But many of them received nasty letters from the IRS. In 2019, many more traders are expected to report their BTC taxes.You Can Write-Off Bitcoin Losses As WellThis jump in the number of HODLers expected to file to the IRS is also in part due to the fact that traders can report their losses as tax write-offs as well. While 61 percent of the Bitcoin community didn\u2019t realize this was possible, people are gradually becoming more aware as the uncertainty clears.With the market crash in 2018, many people sold at a loss. This means that they can chalk up this loss as a tax write-off, which should be of some comfort at least.Many Americans believe the IRS is out to get them. But if they took the time to understand the system a little better, they\u2019d realize they can make it work for them as well as against.Another example of this is long-term capital gains. In the U.S., taxes on long-term profit gains are discounted. This means that if you\u2019re HODLing, it pays, tax-wise at least, to hold on for at least a year and a day, unless you get shot in the foot by market volatility of course.Moreover, BTC wallet to wallet transfers and buying BTC with USD are not taxable events (unless you HODL and make gains or losses). Receiving Bitcoin gifts under $15,000 is also non-taxable.There\u2019s still a long way to go to educate people about their rights and duties when it comes to Bitcoin taxes. But if you start to learn the tricks and keep yourself organized, it won\u2019t be so hectic this time next year.Will you be filing your Bitcoin taxes this year?

He also wants to allow buying S&P 500 and Nasdaq QQQ indices with BTC, particularly by people in emerging markets.\u2018You\u2019ll Be Able to Use Bitcoin and Purchase the S&P 500\u2019Speaking in an interview with Luke Martin on his Venture Coinist podcast, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes revealed that he\u2019s looking to launch bitcoin backed short term bonds and other BTC-backed financial products. Hayes said:I want to create a future where the highest quality exchanges and miners\u2026 issue short-term Bitcoin bonds to the ecosystem.\u201cSo, let\u2019s say you want to buy some 30-day paper. Why can\u2019t you buy a BitMEX 30-day zero-coupon bond that yields some rate of interest that reflects the market\u2019s determination of our credit risk?\u201d he added. The Bitmex CEO explained that in the next few months, his team will be working out the specificiations for this new type of bond.What\u2019s more, Hayes says that Bitmex has funded a new startup that will allow people to invest in S&P 500 and popular Nasdaq stocks using bitcoin without \u2018Bitcoin-USD risk.\u201d \u2026Hopefully, by summer of this year, you\u2019ll be able to use Bitcoin and purchase the S&P 500 and Nasdaq QQQ indices\u2026 and essentially, you won\u2019t have Bitcoin-USD risk. You\u2019ll send bitcoin. They\u2019ll FX it into dollars, and allow you to buy a swap. And when you want to leave, you\u2019ll sell the swap, get back dollars, and then you can get back your bitcoin.According to Hayes, this bitcoin-backed product would open up \u201cthe most liquid and notable indices in the world\u201d to emerging markets, in particular.\u201cSo, this is hopefully going to allow people in emerging markets\u2026to use their Bitcoin to access traditional equity indices,\u201d he explained. Why Bitcoin is Key for BitmexHayes also discussed why Bitcoin technology is so important to BitMEX and why it\u2019s the main reason for his company\u2019s success. For one, Bitmex only takes bitcoin as collateral. This allows it to onboard a customer within 10 minutes, says Hayes. This is because Bitmex can process a deposit or withdrawal with no human intervention and without involvement of third-parties such as a bank. Bitcoin also allows Bitmex to be more financially flexible, such as being able to offer 100X perpetual swaps. The Hong-Kong based platform launched its ETH-USD perpetual swaps in August 2018. Hayes says that in just two months, it became the most liquid ETH-USD trading instrument.\u201cFrom a speculator\u2019s point of view, this is great,\u201d he said. \u201cI have Bitcoin and I want to speculate on Ether vs. USD price, and I want to get my money back in Bitcoin.\u201d Given the success of its perpetual swaps, Bitmex is now looking to launch it for other altcoins (vs. the USD) as well in the future, said Hayes. The CEO also revealed that users can expect a bitcoin options platform that could launch \u201cmaybe in 12-18 months.\u201dFinally, Hayes stated that Bitmex has no plans to get on the in-house token bandwagon like Binance (BNB) or Huobi as it would create more problems than it would solve.It\u2019s complicated in terms of what is the legality around that token: is it a security? [\u2026] We have more than enough issues to deal with [\u2026] than creating a whole set of issues because we issued our own token for money that we don\u2019t need and new problems that we don\u2019t need to have.Will Bitmex\u2019s Bitcoin-backed products open institutional grade trading to illiquid markets?

As Bitcoinist has frequently reported, the exact role North Korea plays in cyberwarfare, and cryptocurrency-based campaigns in particular, is subject to considerable doubt.Episodes such as 2017\u2019s infamous WannaCry cyberattack, ultimately linked to hacker collective the Lazarus Group, remain only partially understood. Crypto\u2019s \u2018Likely Peripheral Role\u2019As such, the report, while warning about potential threats, is also forced to acknowledge from the outset that a lack of verifiable data makes judging those threats all but impossible.\u201cCryptocurrencies likely play only a peripheral role in North Korea\u2019s overall fundraising and sanctions-evasion activity,\u201d the summary continues. However, the sophistication of North Korea\u2019s broader cybercrime operations and its general demand for ongoing financial resources present the risk that its cryptocurrency activity could become a sustained security challenge, particularly as international sanctions lead North Korea to seek financial lifelines outside the mainstream sector.The report nonetheless delineates three major areas which could describe North Korea\u2019s crypto activities. These are fundraising, stockpiling and circumvention.Specifically, Pyongyang may wish to procure cryptocurrency to convert into fiat, as well as hoarding cryptoassets and using them to transact bypassing international sanctions. Mitigate NowAs various hacking reports testify, it is both South Korea and the Southeast Asia sphere that the North appears to target with an eye to achieving these goals.\u201cCountries in Southeast Asia face several vulnerabilities to the types of illicit activity North Korea has engaged in using cryptocurrencies,\u201d the report concludes. The region\u2019s presently uncoordinated approaches to the regulation of cryptocurrencies creates a systemic risk such that its growing cryptocurrency industry may be exploited by North Korea and affiliated networks.Beyond isolated incidents, however, the prognosis once again fails to present an adequate picture as to the exact proliferation of North Korean involvement. RUSI recommends six steps to \u201cmitigate\u201d future dangers, these including risk assessment, beefing up anti-money laundering procedures and increasing interregional cooperation.What do you think about the RUSI report?

Bitcoin Price: Weekly ChartBitcoin price 00 closed the week at $5162 having established new 2019 highs at $5478. This marked the end of a seventh consecutive green candle win streak, closing out on a spinning top doji \u2013 an indecision candle.The weekly chart shows that the price of bitcoin is currently being held down by the declining 50 week moving average. Interestingly, this is exactly what also occurred during the end of the 2015 bear market.Despite the weekly green candle streak failing, the MACD histogram has completed its tenth weekly higher high, illustrating the strength of the emergin bullish trend within this bear market. The MACD line itself is now also threatening to break above its zero line, which is would be for the first time since October 2015.The On balance volume indicator, which plots a combined cumulative volume and price direction, also shows a strong break out of the downward trend and confirms the 2019 trend is supported by strong buying interest in the $3000 price range.2015 vs. 2019 Bitcoin PriceLooking back at the 2019 and 2015 bitcoin price charts, it clearly emphasises that the scenario is very similar \u2013 the 200 WMA has acted as support and following a strong break out to the upside, the 50 WMA has immediately acted as a roadblock.It would therefore seem likely that BTC/USD will need to at least backtest the $4100 breakout level, if not the rapidly rising 200 WMA, which is now north of $3500.However, the main difference between 2015 and 2019 is that there has been a large break in the volume trend to the upside as mentioned earlier, which did not come until later in the 2015 bear market.Combining this with the fact that altcoins such as Litecoin (LTC) appear to be correcting quicker than last time, may suggest that a backtest for Bitcoin may turn out to be a brief event if it occurs at all.4-Hour ChartThe 4-hour bitcoin price chart paints a picture of indecisiveness. Generally speaking bitcoin price continues to build upward momentum after finding support over the weekend at the $5,000 level.This will be the key level to defend early in at the start of this week. Should the $5k level hold, and BTC can progress towards $5250 and $5300, there is a reasonable chance that it will press on towards $5900, with the current price action being a somewhat messy ascending triangle.If the buying pressure in the lower $5ks cannot be maintained, BTC does not have a huge amount of trading history in the $4000s, which could mean that we see bitcoin quickly break down from a head and shoulders top. In this scenario, $4000-$4500 would likely to be the next stop.Golden Cross in SightBitcoin price continues to show strength on higher timeframes and is on course to make a golden cross on the 50-200 day moving average, before the end of April.With strong buying volume witnessed in the break from the $3,000s, it would be reasonable to assume that any correction back to the $4,000s could be short lived and a near term close across $5350 on the daily chart may imply that a test of the $6,000 handle could be in the cards before the end of Q2 2019, if not the end of April.Trade Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

For those of you who haven\u2019t seen it, here\u2019s the link.For myself, even though I respect a lot of what this company has done before, this advertisement completely misses the mark. Yes, bitcoin is considered to be digital gold and they have many things in common. However, gold still has a few advantages that bitcoin does not have.First, physical gold can be used as a safety net in case of a total system meltdown. As the moment, it is impractical to try and transact with bitcoin in the event of an internet or electric failure.Second, gold is much more widely recognized around the world. While we hope that bitcoin will gain in acceptance, there are very few who would argue against gold\u2019s status as a precious store of value and vehicle for hedging investments.What really irks me though, is why are we even having a debate about this in the first place?

All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsThe US Federal Reserve did their best to have an uneventful event yesterday, but there\u2019s still plenty that we can learn from their actions.The key takeaway was\u2026Though this may seem insignificant at first glance, it actually represents a significant shift in policy from the Fed.Before yesterday, they were talking about being patient with rate hikes. Meaning, that the outlook was to raise rates down the line. Now, they\u2019re actually coming out and saying that they have no such outlook and that the next interest rate adjustment, whenever it might happen, could be a hike or it could be a cut.Still, this outlook may have disappointed some investors who were expecting the Fed to be a lot more dovish and lean towards already saying outright that the next move will be a cut.The stock market fell. during the time of the press conference and into the closing bell (purple rectangle).Disruptive StocksNow that all the earnings are in. Well, all the important ones anyway. We can see that the world\u2019s most powerful companies have all been growing at a rapid pace. With the exception of Google, the FAANGs all performed spectacularly during the first quarter of the year.One graph that blew me away on the plane last night was sent from Bloomberg. The white line represents the Fang 6 (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google, Netflix, and Microsoft). The blue line is the MSCI world index excluding the Fang 6, basically all the rest of the stocks in the world.As we can see, these tech giants aren\u2019t only disrupting tech. They\u2019re pretty much disrupting all investments on the planet.Crypto AllocationOn the back of what we wrote yesterday about asymmetrical risk and crypto allocation in an investment portfolio, I\u2019d like to dig a bit deeper. An associate of mine is doing a bit of research on this as well and I do hope to share his findings with you in due time. In the meantime though, let\u2019s have a bit of fun.Here is a poll that I put out on twitter yesterday because I\u2019d really like to know what you all think.Would appreciate if you, as a valued reader, can take a moment to express your opinion on this. If you don\u2019t have a twitter account yet, it might be time to get one. ;)Please also make sure to share it with anyone and everyone you feel may be relevant.

But a company of Facebook\u2019s size and inherent nature faces many challenges that may hinder its progress.Facebook\u2019s problems of decentralizationFacebook\u2019s first problem to change to a private or decentralized platform lays in its business model. Its current generator of revenue is to serve advertisements to its 2.38 billion users.The author surmises that the company will need to change its business model \u201cfrom an ad-revenue model to a financial services model.\u201dThe company\u2019s second problem comes down to privacy, with Pompliano stating:The company\u2019s reputation around privacy is not stellar recently. Whether it exposed sensitive data or gave access to user data based on partnerships, there are plenty of examples to support the detractors\u2019 claims.Facebook\u2019s strengthsHowever, Facebook\u2019s strengths are in the same vein as its weaknesses. As a business that stores and analyzes vasts amounts of data, it\u2019s able to gain insights that would not otherwise be available to other companies or organizations that lack the scale or scope of Facebook.Facebook has over 37,773 employees and $16.6 billion dollars in revenue to make this transition happen, so it\u2019s certainly not lacking in terms of the right resources. And with five new Facebook profiles created per second, it has the right amount of users to make such a paradigm shift possible.Facebook\u2019s decentralization is already in motionAs Bitcoinist has covered extensively in the past, a Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency \u201cFacecoin\u201d could generate the company \u201c$19 billion by 2021\u201d as reported by a Barclays analyst.While Facebook has set its wheels in motion towards decentralization in other arenas. In December last year, Facebook was rumored to be looking to mint its own stablecoin for the Facebook-owned Whatapp.However, Facebook\u2019s efforts at decentralization, and particularly it\u2019s \u201cFacecoin\u201d has come under scrutiny recently. As Bitcoinist revealed, the coin will not function similarly to Bitcoin or any other established cryptocurrency. Instead, the coin will seemingly still play by Facebook\u2019s rules.Nevertheless, the tokens will still be independent to some degree but will lack the fundamental decentralization from governments (and Facebook which created Facecoin).Can a company like Facebook create a decentralized cryptocurrency?

Bitcoin blew up. The general public became aware of it pretty much for the first time, ICO mania kicked in, and some altcoins made gains of over 36,000 percent. Check out the top five best performing altcoins of 2017\u2013and why bigger bubbles are on the horizon.1. XRP +36,008%It\u2019s hard to conceive that any asset (digital or otherwise) could ascend in value by such a dramatic percentage as Ripple\u2019s XRP in 2017. Just to give some kind of reference, after the bull run in cryptocurrencies the year before, the best performing asset of 2018 was cash. Go figure, traders. We\u2019re certainly not talking of returns in the multiple thousands. Cash came out the winner last year simply for not losing as much as all other assets. It seems that after the giddy heights of 2017, cold hard cash actually off-set the catastrophic drops in stocks, bonds, commodities, and well, cryptocurrency, obviously.2. NEM +29,842%NEM gains in 2017 were almost on a par with XRP. That\u2019s like taking a giant yellow highlighter to the rampant volatility and uncertainty of investing in altcoins. NEM may have made colossal gains in 2017, but in January of this year, the Japanese altcoin was circling the drain. Poor management, a bear market, and a bunch of other reasons almost saw this altcoin leave the market for good.3. ARDR +16,809%The percentage gain levels on the third highest gainer still looking pretty ridiculous, galloping ahead by over 16k percent in 2017. The author willingly admits to not knowing too much about this altcoin project. However, upon further research, it appears that ARDR is a blockchain project offering \u201cout of the box solutions and child chains.\u201d Like all the rest,it took a hammering in 2018, with its 2017 ATH resembling Mt. Everest\u2019s peak.4. XLM + 14,441%XML, otherwise known as Stellar Lumens, also had an explosive 2017 just like XRP. However, unlike Ripple, Stellar Lumens sets out to achieve faster, more efficient and transparent cross-border payments in a not-for-profit way. Awesome concept, great founders. Totally tanked in 2018.5. Dash +9,265%Who doesn\u2019t love Dash? Except for every Bitcoin maximalist and advocate of 100 percent decentralization. But, despite the constant shadows surrounding Dash and its infamous alleged \u2018premine\u2019, 2017 saw an explosive year for the cryptocurrency with the goal of becoming the ultimate digital cash.Bitcoinist spoke to Dash\u2019s COO Robert Wiecko recently at Paris Blockchain Summit and he argued that Bitcoin has ceased to become a method of payment.I don\u2019t think there are so many coins trying to do payments. There are only a couple of them\u2026 for example, it\u2019s difficult to say that Bitcoin is for payments right now.So, there you have it. If you want to check out other top gainers from 2017 and where they\u2019re at now, look at the Rhythm Trader\u2019s list which includes ETH, GNT, BNB, LTC, OMG, and, of course, BTC.Why This Is the Smallest Bubble So FarThe Rhythm Trader remarks:And to think, we may look back at this bubble in the future and laugh at how small it was.He certainly has a point. While these percentage gains are astounding, let\u2019s not forget that Apple alone still has $225 billion in cash, more than the entire cryptocurrency market cap. Clearly, we still have a very long way to go. Despite BTC outperforming APPL. Apple has $225 billion of cash.That is more than the entire crypto market cap.\u2014 Pomp \ud83c\udf2a (@APompliano) May 1, 2019Whatever your stance on altcoins, and the bull or bear market, keep one thing in mind.

Matthew North | May 03, 2019 | 05:00 Share Tweet Send Share Sweden\u2019s central bank has its parliament to form a committee to review what constitutes legal tender in the country.Originally reported by Bloomberg\u2019s Amanda Billner, the new committee will give a definitive answer on the definition of legal tender as Sweden increasingly moves away from cash to credit and debit cards for paying for goods and services.Sweden moving away from cash to digital paymentsA statement was given by Sweden\u2019s central bank that seems to clarify its position while also stressing the definition of legal tender\u2019s significance.For 350 years, Swedish society has relied on the Riksbank to provide the general public with various forms of the country\u2019s currency, the Swedish krona. Cash issued by the Riksbank has been legal tender since the 1850s. Cash use has decreased rapidly in Sweden and a scenario within the not-too-distant future, in which cash is not generally accepted, can\u2019t be ruled out.The Swedish cash situation appears to be severe as originally reported by Billner. The author claims that every business from banks to restaurants have refused to either dispense or accept cash as a form of payment. As such, mobile payment apps such as Swish (which is used by 6.3 million people) and bank cards as digital payments have surged in the country.As originally reported by The Local SE, Sweden made an average of 461.5 digital transactions \u201cwhich corresponds to a 13 percent increase in just one year according to the annual World Payments Report.\u201dReady for an E-Krona?Due to the fact that Sweden appears to be increasingly moving away from cash to electronic payments, it would make sense then to deduce that a national cryptocurrency is both feasible and realistic, however, details on the coin have remained sparse.As Bitcoinist reported last year in January, Sweden\u2019s central bank was looking at introducing its own digital currency named the e-Krona \u201cin as few as two years.\u201dIn a research note posted by HSBC economist James Pomeroy, he stated the scope of the possible digital currency and how it might be used.The so-called e-Krona will have to be able to be used for small purchases, as a claim on the Riksbank and be accessible by companies, individuals and financial institutions at all times.Interestingly, one theory says the cryptocurrency would \u201cstored in accounts held in a centralized database,\u201d undermining the entire premise of having a decentralized cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.More recently, Bitcoinist reported of hackers changing the country\u2019s official currency to Bitcoin for a few minutes.Will Sweden be one of the first countries to issue its own cryptocurrency?

Bitcoin Hash Rate Reaches 4th-Highest-Ever LevelData from Blockchain.com currently shows the Bitcoin hash rate \u2013 the computing power responsible for securing the network, at above 58 quintillion hashes per second (58 million tera hashes per second \u2013 TH/s).This figure represents the highest hash seen since late October 2018 and the fourth highest ever hash rate recorded on the Bitcoin network.The increase in hash rate points to more mining nodes being active on the network. With more mining nodes, comes greater security for the Bitcoin network making it more difficult for attack vectors to succeed in compromising the fidelity of the blockchain.Since the start of the year, the Bitcoin network hash rate has consistently increased over a 7-day average period. Back in December 2018, the hash rate plummeted by about 45 percent following the mass shutdown of mining nodes after the almost 50 percent price slide of mid-November.Increasing Difficulty Quashes Mining Capitulation FearsWith rising hash rate should come increasing mining difficulty \u2013 the hash power required to discover a new block. Difficulty acts as a counterbalancing parameter on the network, adding another layer of security.In 2019 so far, the difficulty progression has been a recurring series of climbs and flat periods as more miners come online after the mini capitulation of late 2018.The Bitcoin difficulty is currently at the same level as at late August 2018 when BTC was trading at about $7,000.BTC Shakes off Late April DeclineMeanwhile, the top-ranked cryptocurrency continues its 2019 price growth with another significant 1-day price gain. BTC is six percent in the last 24 hours and looks set to break $5,800.May\u2019s price gain has also seen the Bitcoin market capitalization top $100 billion. The last time the BTC market cap was north of $100 billion was in mid-November 2018.Bitcoin ended April 2019 on a high accumulating 30 percent in gains despite a $400 drop following the $850 million Tether/Bitfinex bombshell.

According to the post, about seventy percent of the survey participants expressed positive sentiments about cryptocurrency.Of the 441 institutional investors that participated in the study, about 47 percent considered digital assets to be an innovative play. About 46 percent also identified the low correlation of digital assets with the mainstream market as one of the major plus points of the emerging asset class.Since 2018, there has been a significant upswing in institutional involvement in cryptocurrency investments. University endowment funds and U.S. public pension funds have taken up investment positions in digital assets.The survey also showed that family offices and financial advisors had the biggest interest in digital assets. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, Grayscale Investments posted record investment earnings in 2018 with institutional investors reportedly consolidatig their stratetgic position in the market.An excerpt from the survey report reads:Even more compelling is how the range of intermediaries has evolved. We began fielding interest from crypto funds and other early movers. Over the past several months we\u2019re seeing interest among family offices, endowments, pensions, and foundations.Cryptocurrency: Alternative or Independent Asset ClassThe Fidelity survey also highlighted an emerging split in the investment philosophy in big money players interested in incorporating cryptocurrencies as part of their investment portfolios. About 32 percent of such respondents see digital assets as an alternative asset class while 15 percent prefer cryptocurrency as an independent asset class.The need for robust custodial solutions was, however, a general theme for the majority of the survey participants. About 76 percent of the institutions involved in the survey identified security protocols as the most important parameter for cryptocurrency custody.Exchange platforms across the market continue to fall victims to hackers with almost $1 billion stolen in 2018 alone. In an interview with Bloomberg, Tom Jessop, president of Fidelity Digital Assets declared that big-money players would prefer trusted custodians to cryptocurrency startups offering custodial services.According to Jessop:People are relying on the institutions they\u2019ve done business with for a long time to fulfill their objectives and needs.

At press time, BTC/USD traded around $6025 on Bitfinex, almost $400 more than other major order books such as Coinbase, Bittrex and Bitstamp. As Bitcoinist already reported, Bitcoin price hit new highs not seen since its November 2018 breakdown this week, topping $5730 Friday before undergoing a slight pullback. Shorts had decreased from a recent peak in line with that pullback.Bitfinex-Tether Legal Case Grinds OnAt the same time, Bitfinex is remonstrating with the New York Attorney General over fresh accusations it lost funds worth $850 million under suspicious circumstances. In the latest revelations, authorities allege Bitfinex lost control of funds it gave to Panama-based Crypto Capital Corp. in summer 2018 as part of a user service deal. Crypto Capital, which has served other well-known industry businesses in the past, then saw its cash confiscated by authorities in several countries, the claims state. In addition, Wednesday saw the indictment of two people who may have controlled Crypto Capital, US authorities arguing they operated an unlicensed money transmitter business. One of them, Reginald Fowler, was arrested April 30, while an Israeli, Ravid Yosef, named as a \u201cco-conspirator,\u201d remains at large.Community Rallies Round Tether FinancingBitfinex has denied it ever lost control of the funds at all, issuing a public statement this week in which it also defended itself against allegations it used capital from sister business Tether (USDT) to plug some of its $850 million funding gap. At the same time, attorneys for Tether and Bitfinex have confirmed the stablecoin is no longer 100 percent backed by fiat dollar assets, adding to concerns over the companies\u2019 operational transparency. Proponents have defended the move, arguing any funding deal was beneficial for both Tether investors and Bitfinex users. \u201c\u2026I think Tether deserves a slap on the wrist for the creative accounting it engaged in last year,\u201d blockchain analyst Ciaran Murray wrote in a dedicated social media debate May 1.I think the current credit arrangement is a good one for both businesses (and) their customers alike. The current injunction is helping nobody.Meanwhile, analysts are looking beyond Bitfinex as markets already shake off the impact of the legal woes.Fundstrat analysts Tom Lee and Robert Sluymer are already advising clients to accumulate Bitcoin while they can should short-term volatility reappear, before H2 2019 unleashes another bull run. 2020, Lee added, should see new all-time highs above $20,000.What do you think about Bitfinex\u2019s Bitcoin price premium?

Prior to that, markets traded around $4000, with sentiment eyeing a further drop to $3000 or even lower before the bear market ended.In line with previous behavior, exchange Bitfinex currently trades Bitcoin around $300 higher than other platforms.Mahmudov Flags Bullish Price CrossoverThe unlikely growth has thus seen various figures change their minds on the near future, including veteran Murad Mahmudov, who in April gave a 75 percent probability that Bitcoin would no longer drop lower than $3000 again.Now, Mahmudov was contemplating fresh charts as Bitcoin price passed $5420 earlier Friday. Specifically, it was a crossover of moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA) which completed as BTC/USD hit $5430 which caught his attention.Within a broader timeframe, an accompanying chart shows, it was the crossover points of Bitcoin price and the EMA that signalled the start of bullish performance. This week\u2019s performance was already enough to bring back Bitcoin\u2019s $100 billion market cap, putting it decisively ahead of second-place cryptocurrency Ether ($17.7 billion).Bitcoin\u2019s overall market cap share is now at 55.5 percent, its highest since September 2018.What Tether Legal Problems?The latest segment of the bull run meanwhile coincides with the release of the latest Bitcoin Core client 0.18.0As Bitcoinist reported, Mahmudov is far from alone in his buoyant outlook for Bitcoin price. As April continued into May, bullish behavior dragged other previously reticent analysts out of hiding, among the Fundstrat Global Advisors\u2019 co-founder Tom Lee.Lee, who previously told clients he would stop giving Bitcoin price predictions altogether, this week announced he now viewed 2020 as the goal for BTC/USD hitting new all-time highs above $20,000. A potential limit on performance, he added, was the ongoing legal questions around stablecoin Tether (USDT) and sister company Bitfinex. Nonetheless, despite the controversy, Bitcoin markets have already managed to shake off any uncertainty, having lost $400 last week as news of the legal battle hit.

But this week, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) launched a data-matching program, in an attempt to hunt down evaders.Up To 1 Million Australians Hold Crypto AssetsAccording to ATO estimates, between 500,000 and one million Australians have holdings in some form of crypto asset. Of particular concern is the use of cryptocurrency to move and hide funds within the black economy, or links to unexplained wealth and undeclared taxable capital gains.However, with the help of other regulators and international agencies, it also hopes to identify those who are unintentionally paying the wrong amount of tax. Deputy Commissioner, Will Day, explained:We want to help taxpayers to get it right and ensure they are paying the correct amount of tax.Could Limited Data And Obligation Spell Limited Success?The ATO accepts that it has \u201climited data\u201d on the levels of cryptocurrency investment and gains made by Australian taxpayers. In turn, both the taxpayers and third parties have limited obligation to divulge such information. So results are anything but guaranteed.However, the ATO has apparently already received \u201cacceptable\u201d data samples from potential suppliers. Also, the data-matching project will ongoing so results may improve over time.The ATO plans to contact any parties of interest, giving them 28 days to clarify any relevant information found.Australia Bitcoin TaxesCryptocurrency tax filings could reach all-time highs this year. Lower prices across the board allow traders to claim tax deductions for their losses. However many are still not aware that they can do this.Australia has seen a mixed year for cryptocurrency, with Huobi shutting their Aussie operations, while Binance launched their \u2018new\u2019 cash-for-crypto service at newsagents across the country.

Will BTC tackle $6,000 next? Bitcoin Price: Market OverviewThings are looking up for Bitcoin price 00. Surprisingly the Tether \u2013 Bitfinex debacle appears to have had a limited impact on the bullish sentiment present in the crypto market and Bitcoin is now up 51% from its 2018 low. At the moment it seems everyone from the world of institutional finance like Fidelity Investments, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to analysts like Barry Silbert, Tom Lee and Peter Brandt are labeling Bitcoin\u2019s current price action as indicative of a bull market. Let\u2019s take a quick glance at the charts to see what\u2019s going on. Weekly ChartThe 12 and 26 EMA are on the verge of pulling off a bull cross on the weekly time frame for the first time since early October 2015 and the Bitfinex premium has already pushed BTC price above $6,000. BTC\u2019s most recent move brought the digital asset above the 55 EMA and a glance at the daily chart shows BTC set a higher high today. Looking back to mid- November 2018 when BTC surprisingly dropped from $7,300, there is little overhead resistance from $6,300 so barring bears setting up a wall of shorts at $6,000 and $6,3000 BTC, and assuming demand remands healthy, Bitcoin could pull of a blue sky breakout to $7,300 over the coming weeks. 4-Hour ChartSince March BTC has successfully rallied off the successive inverse head and shoulder formations and today\u2019s move above the $5,488 neckline supported BTC\u2019s move to $5,750 on Coinbase. The MACD is reaching into overbought territory, as is the RSI but it should be noted that powerful upside moves from BTC often allow the RSI to linger deep in overbought territory so trading decisions shouldn\u2019t be based solely off an RSI reading. The gap (lack of support/resistance) between $5,500 and $6,350 could soon be exploited by bulls and after setting a higher high Bitcoin will retrace some traders gather profit and a brief period of consolidation should occur before BTC makes another run at $6,000. $5,620 and $5,500 (12-EMA) appear to be interim supports and a drop below $5,400 could represent a decent purchasing opportunity.BTC-USD ShortsTraders are advised to keep an eye on BTC-USD shorts chart and MACD on the daily and 4-hour chart. Over the past week, BTC-USD shorts rose about 20 percent as the Tether \u2013 Bitfinex scandal took its toll on BTC price and many analysts have also documented the capital outflow from Bitfinex as cautious traders look to exit the scandal-ridden exchange. As always, there is the possibility of a short squeeze which could help propel BTC well above $6,000.

Most importantly, the price appears to follow the Stock-to-flow macroeconomic model.The SF model displays a price uptrend. Notably, as the halvening is expected to reduce sell pressure on the supply side. A lack of interest from sellers could help the price climb upwards from its current levels.However, these kinds of rallies are stymied by a lack of selling pressure rather than interest from buyers, and can quickly climb into overbought levels followed by a sharp downside correction.The halvening countdownBitcoin block reward halvings occur roughly once every four years. Each time the network halves the network reduces the mining reward by 50 percent. At present, miners are rewarded with 12.5 BTC each time a block is mined. By May 2020, that number will be halved down 6.25 BTC.There are less than 390 days to go.As Bitcoinist has reported previously, the price of Bitcoin seems to rally one year after the \u2018halvening\u2019 event occurs. In fact, there appears to be a direct correlation between the price of bitcoin and halvening events that cannot be ignored.There have been other models used to predict the price of Bitcoin that pushes the price of Bitcoin higher \u2014 except on a more futuristic timescale.For instance, a $1 trillion market cap was predicted for Bitcoin after the halving that will occur in 2020 implying a price of $55,000.However, the price of bitcoin could climb to even higher levels in 2023. A \u201cmassive rally\u201d could push the coin to the astronomical price of $10 million dollars. This figure was taken from the model that prices seem to increase bi-laterally, as well as hash rate, which analyst, Max Keiser says \u201cnever left\u201d the bull market.Given these theories, we can expect the next halvening event to be a major cornerstone in Bitcoin\u2019s history and have a significant impact on the currency\u2019s evaluation. How high bitcoin\u2019s price will climb is still up to debate, but the consensus overall is that we can expect higher prices than what we\u2019re seeing now as shown by previous halvings and bitcoin stock to flow.Will bitcoin price be over $10,000 by 2020 at the time of the halving?

The initiative uses blockchain technology to enable an \u201ceasy and reliable way\u201d to prove qualifications through tamper-free certification.Authenticating An EducationThe concept is simple enough.

It allows for any education institute to issue OpenCerts, and for anyone to quickly check the validity of a digital certificate.Cutting Through The PaperworkThis should make the job application and hiring process smoother for both the applicant, employer, and issuing institutions.Students would no longer have to request certified-true copies of certificates from schools.

And there\u2019s no better way of gathering those than posting a charged (and slightly leading) call to action on Reddit. In light of Tether\u2019s vast negligence, should the community call on exchanges to delist? from CryptoCurrency There you go. Perfect. No need to detail Tether\u2019s \u2018vast negligence\u2019; simply claiming it will convince most folk, especially with the current bad press. Seed of mob planted, just sit back while it gains momentum (and some high-profile support).The Groundswell Of Popular OpinionCoinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, gave the campaign some early credibility, tweeting:With the confirmation that Tether is not fully collateralized, my hope is that the industry graduates to more trustworthy stablecoins.Swiss crypto-exchange, IQFinex, then bought into the argument wholesale, announcing the delisting of Tether as of 3rd May.Following Binance\u2019s delisting of Bitcoin SV, many were questioning why CZ didn\u2019t step in and act as \u2018judge, jury and executioner\u2019 against Tether.Now, whatever you may think of Tether (or CZ for that matter), let\u2019s examine that last idea. In general, someone with the power of \u2018judge, jury, and executioner\u2019, is considered to be a bad thing. A very bad thing indeed if you care about justice in any way, shape or form. Is this really something that we want in the crypto-industry?Calm Down Dear, It\u2019s Just A CommercialLet\u2019s all just take a step back and look at things rationally.Detractors have been going after Tether since it was announced. It is unsurprising that a vocal minority is using the current uncertainty as an attempt to stick the knife in.In actual fact, many of Tether\u2019s early problems, and Bitfinex\u2019s $850 million \u2018seizure\u2019, were pretty much down to the same thing. Namely, the traditional banking world\u2019s unwillingness to deal with cryptocurrency businesses.This forces them to deal with lesser known, offshore, and sometimes highly dodgy entities. Authorities dismantled one such bank just this week; the same bank which held some of Bitfinex\u2019s missing $850 million.Rather than infighting amongst ourselves, the crypto-community should be fighting for the rights of all its members. A Tether which is short-term 26% backed by Bitfinex stock would still seem like a pretty solid coin.Assuming that is, that the mob doesn\u2019t take down Bitfinex too.Should exchanges like Binance delist Tether?

This time around, he described the top-ranked cryptocurrency as being nothing but a gamble dominated by frauds.As quoted by CNBC, the Berkshire Hathaway chief opined:It doesn\u2019t do anything. It just sits there. It\u2019s like a seashell or something, and that is not an investment to me. It\u2019s a gambling device\u2026 there\u2019s been a lot of frauds connected with it. There\u2019s been disappearances, so there\u2019s a lot lost on it. Bitcoin hasn\u2019t produced anything.Buffett\u2019s characterization of Bitcoin as a fraud-filled arena is particularly rich given the plethora of indictments against Wells Fargo, a bank which Berkshire Hathaway owns almost 10 percent.In just under 20 years, the bank has been indicted a staggering 93 times and fined more than $14 billion. And the crimes ascribed to Wells Fargo, well, they include such gems as account forgeries, insurance fraud, and illegal charges to mention a few.Every single jurisdiction that has released reports on financial crimes shows that cryptocurrencies as a whole contribute only a minute portion. In Japan, the National Police Agency reported that 98.3 percent of money laundering cases in 2018 didn\u2019t involve cryptocurrency.Buffett has a history of anti-Bitcoin rhetoric, calling the cryptocurrency rat-poison squared. The irony in this retort is that it implies that banks are the rats.Blockchain Promises Better PotentialWhile Buffett may boast a storied investment career, the Berkshire Hathaway boss has often missed the boat when it comes to technology. Thus, it is unsurprising to see him join the \u201cblockchain not Bitcoin\u201d bandwagon.According to Buffett, \u201cblockchain is big\u2026 it doesn\u2019t need Bitcoin.\u201dThe above comment is unsurprising coming from someone who initially dismissed companies like Amazon and Apple. Also, Buffett is repeating the incorrect assertion that blockchain is the support system for Bitcoin.1/ Reminder: \"the blockchain\" is the undesirable waste that is produced during the useful process of transferring bitcoins.THREAD pic.twitter.com/RHgvPbgMt3\u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) January 21, 2019In simple terms, the blockchain is the waste product of the cryptographic process employed in the transfer of Bitcoin.

Some people have speculated on Twitter that the whale is Bitcointalk user \u201cLoaded\u201d who is a well-known poster on the forum. Loaded is as well-known for his posts on the forum as he is for his stash of 40,000 BTC. Bitcointalk's famous whale Loaded is moving its 40k BTC stash again.https://t.co/t6y909jN2Ehttps://t.co/TrHwb4s2H6\u2014 Antoine Le Calvez (@khannib) May 1, 2019Further theories floated around on the forum itself that it was Loaded who made the transaction \u2014 although the user has not confirmed or denied that they made the transaction.It should be noted that the Bitcoin in the address shows a pattern of moving from one address to the next for no apparent reason according to the transaction history on Blockchain.com.Another thing to note is the first three characters of the address. \u2018bc1\u2019 means that the address is using the segregated witness (SegWit) protocol that currently accounts for 40% of all Bitcoin transactions according to transactionfee.info. Segwit is a protocol that was introduced on the 23rd of August to make Bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper.The amount of money used to move the $292,000 million was only 57 cents according to the data. As Bitcoinist reported earlier, Bitcoin fees are often mismatched with how much the user should actually be paying. This mistake, according to researchers, was due to the fact that consumer wallets appear to incorrectly estimate the required fee.Although the 40,000 Bitcoin transaction is no small amount, it pales in comparison to the transaction that occurred on the 10th of January this year.A total of 130,004 BTC ($742,972,860.00) was sent to the following address. (385cR5DM96n1HvBDMzLHPYcw89fZAXULJP). To date, this remains as the second largest bitcoin transaction ever, with the largest being 500,000 BTC which occurred on November 16, 2011.Bitcoin whales accumulateAs previously reported by Bitcoinist, the whales in the market seem to be going through a period of accumulation. In fact, 100 of the largest bitcoin wallet addresses accumulated 150,000 extra bitcoin.Bitcoinist did the math on this accumulation and deduced that they came from wallets holding less than 1,000 and 10,000 BTC. So the \u2018rich\u2019 are getting richer \u2014 many of which belong to exchanges \u2014 while the less-informed crypto speculators continue dropping bags.What do you think of the crypto market?

Silver is $15 (billion.) That is .17%. (Bitcoin) has a $90 (billion market) cap. (Litecoin) is $5.7 (billion) which is 6.4% of (Bitcoin).

I don't get this rally. Sell $ltc buy $btc.\u2014 Michael Novogratz (@novogratz) April 3, 2019Like many major altcoins, Litecoin had rallied strongly this week as a sudden bullish move took Bitcoin up over $1300 to hit $5300 before it settled around $4950. At one point, LTC/USD had achieved weekly gains of 50 percent, now trading around $87 against $61 previously.For Novogratz, however, that bull run contained little substance. \u201cI don\u2019t get this rally. Sell (Litecoin and) buy (Bitcoin),\u201d he added.\u2018Can\u2019t Be More Wrong\u2019Responding, Lee claimed Novgratz \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more wrong,\u201d pointing to various new features involving Litecoin which are now debuting. In particular, a new cryptocurrency exchange leveraging both Bitcoin and Litecoin\u2019s Lightning Network (LN) implementation allows the latter to top up balances of the former via a feature known as cross-chain atomic swaps. His advocacy, however, appeared to have the opposite effect to that which Lee intended. On Twitter, figures such as commentator Mr. Hodl took issue with Lee\u2019s lack of skin in the game, while developer Cobra likened his words to promotional content by Bitcoin Cash advocate Roger Ver.Others were surprised at Novogratz\u2019s choice of slighting another cryptocurrency project. The investment mogul has maintained an otherwise neutral stance within industry politics, opting only to reiterate his belief in Bitcoin\u2019s solid future in mainstream press interviews. Last month, Novogratz said the Bitcoin price had found a form of \u201cequilibrium\u201d in the mid-$3000 range, something which has since failed to remain current.By year end, he forecast, BTC/USD could run to $8000 or higher, depending on overall sentiment.After increasing his stake in embattled Galaxy Digital to 80 percent of the company in January meanwhile, the bank saw an abrupt change of fortune, delivering some of the best industry results in the first quarter.

The company sent us over two nodes \u2014 one for review, and another for a giveaway. Here\u2019s our review! Casa Node\u2019s Design: Simple and DiscreteThe Casa Node\u2019s design is simple and relatively understated. The node is essentially a small white box with a purple Casa logo stuck on the top \u2014 and that\u2019s about it. Unlike a bulky or sometimes-atrocious-looking piece of mining equipment, Casa\u2019s node is discrete. It will likely not be noticed by any guests chilling in its vicinity.As such, it won\u2019t be the most beautiful piece of tech in your household, nor will it be the ugliest. In reality, it should blend right in next to your wireless router, should you choose to place it there \u2014 which you probably will, since it requires a wired connection.One particular design flaw, perhaps, is the fact that you have to \u2014 literally \u2014 plug the Casa node into itself. Specifically, the internal hard drive needs to be plugged from one side of the node into an adjacent side with an included cable. It\u2019s not an elegant solution but was presumably done to keep the node small. Either way, it\u2019s kinda weird.The device itself isn\u2019t particularly sturdy. I highly doubt it would survive a drop from your hand to the floor \u2014 at least not multiple times \u2014 but this isn\u2019t exactly something I\u2019m willing to test.Setting Up The Casa Node: Get ComfortableSetting up the Casa Node was easy \u2014 and by \u201csetting up,\u201d I mean plugging it in. Everything after that was \u2026 let\u2019s just say \u2026 not so easy.For some, automatic detection of the node\u2019s IP address may happen. For me, it did not, so I had to discover it manually with a third-party IP Scanner. The scanner failed to detect the IP address, so I had to do some tweaking in my firewall settings until it showed up. Once I had the node\u2019s IP address, typing it into the browser, unfortunately, yielded no results.I took the time to eat some lunch and calm my mild frustration while contemplating contacting customer support. When I came back from lunch, however, the dashboard had loaded itself into my browser.The next step of the process was quick and painless, requiring writing down a 24-word recovery phrase and setting a password. (Note that there is no way to reset your password if you forget it \u2014 so you\u2019d better not forget it.)Then, the pain came.The Casa Node and Port Forwarding ProblemsAfter the Casa Node was fully synced, which didn\u2019t take that long, the next hair-pulling step came in setting up the Lightning Network and receiving inbound connections for the Bitcoin Full Node.Without getting too deeply into the details, the universal plug-and-play function that should make Casa Node special didn\u2019t work in my case \u2014 a problem not so much with Casa, but with my wireless router. I am a fairly tech-savvy individual, but my router\u2019s settings provided significantly more complicated setup procedures which rendered Casa\u2019s self-help tips on its website useless.Instead, I called up a smart friend who, after perhaps half an hour, successfully helped me set up port forwarding for the node. This opened up incoming connections to by Bitcoin Node while also opening up the Lightning Network. To be honest, it is highly unlikely I would have solved this issue myself before simply giving up.I am confident I am not the only person who has had or will have these issues, as evidenced by the number of resources already dedicated to solving these problems present on the internet from both Casa and individual users.Lightning Network DisappointmentLet me preface this section of the review by saying that I am personally bullish on Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network, a second-layer scaling solution. However, my experience with the Casa Node all but confirmed to me that the Lightning Network is not ready for prime time.Even with a fully-set-up Casa Node, I failed to both send and receive payments after multiple attempts. I had allocated a healthy amount of BTC to the Lightning Network, set up 10 payment channels using the node\u2019s recommended Autopilot feature, and manually opened channels with various other users on the network. Nevertheless, I still maintained an incoming transaction capacity of 0.0 BTC. Even more frustrating, not a single payment sent to my friends and colleagues went through.I\u2019m not sure I am willing to blame Casa for this problem, as I believe the fault may lie more with the Lightning Network\u2019s still kludgy state. There also could be networking issues on my side preventing the sending and receiving of Lightning payments. Either way, after some weeks with the node, I simply stopped caring.My node apparently had reciprocal feelings, as every time I checked in on it, it was undiscoverable on my network with an IP scanner and appeared to be offline \u2014 despite the fact that I continuously left it plugged in and never shut off my internet.Do I blame Casa for this? Not really. Do I blame the Lightning Network for this? Not really. Still, the simple fact remains that I was unable to send a Lightning payment via my Casa Node for weeks, following a painfully complicated set-up procedure.Will everyone have this problem? Certainly not. Will many? Yes. Don\u2019t expect grandma to be setting up her own Casa Node anytime soon. More realistically, don\u2019t expect your local small business owner to be setting up their own, either.Casa Node Review: ConclusionThe Casa Node is a simple and discrete device for operating a Bitcoin full node, which is does quite well. I highly recommend this device for anyone looking to participate in the strengthening of the Bitcoin network by operating a full node \u2014 there is no simpler way to do this, plain and simple.As a Lightning Network node, I also recommend the Casa Node \u2014 despite my problems with it. Bitcoin\u2019s second-layer scaling solution is a difficult concept for the average person to grasp, technically speaking, especially if they don\u2019t have a fairly-deep understanding of Bitcoin itself. Because of this, setting up Casa\u2019s device to successfully send and receive payments is no easy task, but it is almost certainly easier than trying to do it yourself via other methods.If you\u2019re on the fence about buying a Casa Node to run a full node and dabble with the Lightning Network, I say go for it.

On-Chain Bitcoin Volume Hits 16-Month High Osato Avan-Nomayo \u00b7 @3rdPesinSingula | May 04, 2019 | 12:00 Share Tweet Send Share The Bitcoin daily transaction volume is now at its highest level since January 2018 showing increased on-chain economic activity. Meanwhile, transaction count and average blocksize on the network continue to move in the same upward direction, proof that the 1MB blocksize limit is well and truly a thing of the past in the post-SegWit Bitcoin era.Bitcoin On-Chain Transactions on the RiseData from Blockchain.com shows that daily Bitcoin on-chain transaction volume has risen to 452,646. This figure corresponds to the highest transaction count since January 2018.This current network activity is also the second highest in the history of the Bitcoin network. The last time the network processed more than 450,000 on-chain transactions, the BTC price was still north of $10,000.Despite falling below 300,000 transactions per day for a few weeks in May, Bitcoin\u2019s economic activity has been on the rise since the start of the year. Even during the extended bear run of 2018, the network continued to record above 300,000 transactions.Several experts say the improving network fundamentals point to another significant bull rally for the top-ranked cryptocurrency. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, the network hash rate is also reaching new heights which signals an increase in computational resources being expended on the blockchain.Output Values Show a Mixed BagTotal daily transactions only paint a broad-based picture of on-chain economic activity. To get better coverage of Bitcoin adoption, actual daily output values need to be considered.Data from Outputs.today show Bitcoin\u2019s outputs per day at 1,011,024 which corresponds to about 2.62 outputs per transaction. Bitcoin\u2019s current output level is more than 30 percent higher than it was during the bull phase of late 2017.With the prevalence of transaction batching by large exchange platforms, the days of four or five outputs per transaction are seemingly a thing of the past. The emergence of SegWit is also causing larger blocksizes to become more popular on the blockchain.Data from Transactionfee.info shows the average blocksize at the 1.15MB. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, even blocks larger than 2MB are also becoming quite common.With these improving technical fundamentals and the current price rally comes the expectation of Bitcoin recovering a significant portion of its 2018 losses. As reported by Bitcoinist on Friday, stock-to-flow models show Bitcoin surpassing $10,000 by the time of the next halving in 2020.With price and network fundamentals moving in the same upward trajectory, do you think Bitcoin will reach another all-time high in this bull cycle?

Bitcoin Outstrips Tesla by 52 PercentLooking at the YTD price figures for Bitcoin and TSLA, BTC has outperformed Tesla stock by more than 50 percent. Bitcoin is up 30 percent since the start of the year while TSLA\u2019s continued slide sees its stock price drop 14.9 percent within the same period.Bitcoin price has been on a hot streak, recording six consecutive weekly price gains while Tesla has been plummeting for close to three months. Analysts believe slide in the company\u2019s share price is due to poor delivery figures from its Model 3 cars.Commenting on the issue to CNBC, David Tamberrino of Goldman Sachs said:Altogether, we think the delivery results will put pressure on TSLA\u2019s shares, and corroborates our belief that volume expectations for the company\u2019s products in 2019 are too high with consumer demand likely lower as subsidies phase out in the US.Analysts from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan to name a few are lowering their price targets for TSLA on account of its recent performance. Bitcoin, meanwhile, continues to maintain the $5,000 price mark despite a slight pullback on Thursday (April 4, 2019).Bitcoin Continues to Deliver Better ReturnsDespite the usual rhetoric of critics who debunk the haven asset status of Bitcoin, the top-ranked cryptocurrency continues to outperform the mainstream market. Back in February, Bitcoinist reported that investors with one percent of their portfolio in BTC enjoyed greater returns than the S&P 500, gold, and U.S. Treasury bonds.While the likes of JPMorgan will say BTC only has value in a dystopian economy, Bitcoin has outperformed the DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 almost every year over the last decade. Not even Warren Buffet\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway has managed such a feat, notwithstanding BTC\u2019s multiple 85 percent price drops within the last 10 years.Bitcoin remains uncorrelated to the stock market, making a suitable hedge against uncertainties in the mainstream arena.

What\u2019s more, it also allows for swapping bitcoin and litecoin using LN or cross-atomic chain swaps. Financial Sovereignty Uber AllesTrading shouldn\u2019t require an account.So claims the tagline of new instant, account free, and non-custodial digital asset exchange, Boltz. Well that\u2019s three for three so far. And as you may already have guessed from the name, it also plays nice with Lightning Network.But \u2018Account Free\u2019 cryptocurrency exchanges are nothing new, I hear you say. That\u2019s right, but we are at risk of them becoming exactly the opposite \u2013 consigned to history. On the website, Boltz specifically calls out ShapeShift for its about-turn on data-collection last year. While introducing membership as a requested \u2018feature\u2019, it conceded that it was soon to be mandatory\u2026 and that it \u2018sucked\u2019.Boltz points out that by creating an account on a KYC\u2019ed custodial exchange:you are giving the government and anyone who can access that KYC data, the power to not only know that you have crypto assets but also to confiscate them during a trade.So in bold letters, Boltz claims it\u2026 \u201cdoes not and will never collect any data that could identify our users.\u201dBuilt On Lightning Network to Build Lightning NetworkWhile Lightning Network helps with scaling Bitcoin, and provides faster and cheaper transactions, it does have its own challenges. Boltz therefore bridges the two layers with submarine swaps, so that on-chain transactions work seamlessly in conjunction with LN.The theory being, that on-chain transactions can act as a catalyst to encourage the growth of Lightning Network. This would work by giving LN the escape velocity needed until the network effect overcomes issues with infrequent transactions and inbound capacities.In order to achieve trust minimisation, Boltz uses submarine swaps to exchange coins between lightning channels and the main chain.Testing, Testing, 1, 2, 3The platform is currently available for alpha-testing, so limits are in place, but exchanges between Bitcoin and Litecoin are possible, in both Lightning and non-Lightning flavors.One of the current benefits of this service is that it can provide inbound capacity on lightning channels. Acquiring inbound liquidity can be a hassle without making outbound transactions, especially for merchants. Lightning Labs\u2019 Lightning Loop provides a similar service, but without the graphical user interface of the new exchange.Another entrant in the category of lightning-enabled, account free exchanges is ZigZag.io. Currently still in beta-testing, it allows exchanges from bitcoin lightning to BTC, LTC, DASH, and ETH and back. It also claims to support bitcoin cash, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be an available option. Payments are exchanged off-chain, but ZigZag hopes to implement atomic swaps in the future, to improve trust-minimisation.Whilst Boltz is still very much in the experimental phase (like LN itself), it will be interesting to see if it achieves its stated goal of encouraging Lightning adoption.Will no-account, instant exchanges using LN make Shapeshift obsolete?

Despite its status, Blockchain has yet to deliver Segregated Witness-enabled Bitcoin addresses as standard, a feature which contributes significantly to keeping fees low.

Recent Rally \u2018Much More Valid\u2019Citing analysts from market intelligence company Flipside Crypto, Bloomberg reported that a large number of idle Bitcoin wallets have become active. According to the report, dormant wallets that have been inactive from one to six months, have decreased by 40 percent since March 15th.It\u2019s also worth noting that the number of unique active Bitcoin daily addresses has increased tantamount to the drop since March 15th, further supporting their claims.Commenting on the matter was Eric Stone, co-founder, as well as head of data science at Flipside, who noted:If you are a crypto optimist, that\u2019s good news. [\u2026] There are more people warming up to the idea of buying Bitcoin.The CEO of the company has also outlined that the latest rally was \u201cmuch more valid\u201d compared to Bitcoin\u2019s surge last fall in October. According to him, it is because many smaller wallets are \u201cwaking up,\u201d and not because of a \u201cfew whale moves.\u201dWe see this move much more valid than a few whale moves in October. [\u2026] This probably signifies a change in perception or confidence in this asset class.Interestingly enough, back in March, another popular Bitcoin proponent, the chief analyst at Fundstrat Global Advisors, Tom Lee, also brought up the topic of active wallets, outlining it as a reason for future growth.In a world where there are 50 million active wallets today and 5 billion Visa cardholders, clearly the crypto market can just grow because of adoption.But Is This Really the Case?While an increased number in active Bitcoin wallets can definitely be seen as somewhat a positive sign, it\u2019s questionable if that was really the cause for the recent price surge.Citing industry expert Oliver Von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO at cryptocurrency firm BCB Group, Reuters reported that Bitcoin\u2019s rally was \u201cprobably\u201d triggered by a $100 million order spread across cryptocurrency exchanges Kraken, Bitstamp, and Coinbase.There has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across these three venues, of around 20,000 BTC. [\u2026] If you look at the volumes on each of those three exchanges \u2013 there were in-concert, synchronized, units of volume of around 7,000 BTC in an hour.The move, as further reported, has managed to set off a frenzy of algorithmic hedge fund trading. This is a method which takes advantage of automated software to identify trends and to determine when trades should be carried out.In fact, 17 new algorithm trading hedge funds have launched since September last year, according to Bloomberg, purportedly comprising 40 percent of cryptocurrency hedge funds throughout the period.Is Bitcoin\u2019s latest rally for real or simply a pump by whales?

Broken Record: Roubini Has Nothing New to SayNouriel \u2018Dr. Doom\u2019 Roubini \u2013 a New York University economics professor regurgitated his old hits, calling cryptocurrency a bubble and saying that it was only useful to criminals and tax evaders looking to launder money with virtual currencies as the \u201cNew Swiss bank.\u201dHowever, having made the above assertions, Roubini then goes on to say:I don\u2019t think crypto payments for criminal activity is going be the future of it. They\u2019re not anonymous and even for cryptos that try to be anonymous like Monero, kleptocratic governments will make sure your wallet is registered.Dr. Doom also relived some other hits like price manipulation claims, pump and dump schemes, exchange hacks as well as ICO fraud as reasons why cryptocurrencies are worthless. Roubini debunked the assertion that virtual currencies represented an emerging financial system, instead, calling them an inefficient barter system that will never overcome the \u201ctrilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability.\u201dIn response, Buterin countered Roubini on many of his claims especially regarding the anonymity of cryptos providing cover for criminal activities. According to the Ethereum co-founder, any convenience offered by cryptocurrencies as a payment means is enjoyed by all; whether for \u201cunconventional activities\u201d or otherwise.Buterin: \u2018There Are Definetely Some Real Concerns\u2019Buterin also chided Roubini\u2019s skewered criticism which fails to take into account the many benefits of cryptocurrency adoption. The Ethereum co-founder pointed to the convenience of making international payments via virtual currency, as well as, the added benefit of cryptocurrencies being censorship-resistant.As for the perceived inefficiencies in the technology, Buterin highlighted the continuous stream of technological advancements currently ongoing in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Commenting on cryptocurrency trilemma, Buterin opined:There are definitely some real concerns but they\u2019re an artifact of the tech as it exists in 2019, rather than inherent. The trilemma didn\u2019t come with mathematical proofs. It is not impossible to have scalability and decentralization and security.Happening now at @Deconomy_forum 2019: R3\u2019s Antony Lewis ( @antony_btc ) moderates a dynamic panel between Vitalik Buterin ( @VitalikButerin ) and Nouriel Roubini ( @Nouriel ).The panel covers from proof of state in #cryptocurrency to the stability of this #assetclass. pic.twitter.com/08GW1mSWyl\u2014 R3 (@inside_r3) April 4, 2019Facts Trump Sentiments When It Comes to CryptocurrencySome of Roubini\u2019s criticisms come from a lack of understanding of the technologyNocoiners like Roubini present Bitcoin to be this shadowy construct that allows criminals to carry out illegal activities with ease. However, the facts say differently.Japan\u2019s National Police Agency earlier in the year revealed that 98.3 percent of all recorded money laundering cases in the country for 2018 didn\u2019t involve cryptocurrency. Intelligence agencies still report that terrorists have trouble adopting cryptocurrency to fund jihadist activities.Meanwhile, major banks like Danske Bank get indicted for money laundering to the tune of $325 billion. As reported by Bitcoinist, anti-Bitcoin banks have paid more than $240 billion in fines for money laundering indictments since the financial crisis of 2008.Warren Buffett is another Bitcoin basher who has previously called the top-ranked cryptocurrency \u201crat poison.\u201d Never mind that Berkshire Hathaway (owned by Buffett) has a ten percent stake in Wells Fargo, a bank with 93 violations and more than $14 billion in penalty fines.Do you still pay attention to the opinions of nocoiners like Roubini?

In a recent memo to investors called growing the pie, Marks goes into great detail of everything that he believes is going wrong in US politics at the moment and how it\u2019s influencing the markets.What struck me, was that in the entire eight pages of brilliance and laying out all of the major risks, the words \u2018tariff\u2019 and \u2018trade\u2019 do not even appear. To me, this is a clear sign that what ails the United States at the moment is deep beneath the headlines.Indeed, for me anyway, global politics is becoming less of a concern by the day. In a recent poll from Goldman Sachs, 48% of respondents said that Brexit was their biggest focus in April.Given my limited knowledge of Brexit however, as a macro investor, I\u2019m actually trying to limit focus on it wherever possible. Yes, the headlines and deadlines are important, but unless they start moving the markets in a meaningful way I don\u2019t see much point in making it my main focus.By the way, my answer was \u2018J\u2019.

All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsAs you probably know, the US jobs report known as NFP is the most anticipated report that comes out every month. It\u2019s been known to move every asset from currencies, to commodities, and of course stocks. Given Wall Street\u2019s increasing participation in the crypto market lately, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Bitcoin moves from it today as well.Crypto SidetrackHere we can see the volumes on CME\u2019s bitcoin futures product, which reached 22,542 contracts yesterday, which is about $563 million.According to Messari, the top 10 real exchanges traded about $685 million over the last 24 hours. So even though the CME\u2019s contracts are cash settled and no Bitcoin is actually changing hands, Wall Street needs to be seen as a significant part of the market now.Back to NFPAnalysts are forecasting that when the data is released it will show that the United States has added more than 170,000 jobs in the month of March.You can check the results as they come out on sites like forexfactory.com or fxstreet\u2019s economic calendar, or of course by following financial people/news on social media.They are also forecasting an average salary bump of 0.3% and the unemployment rate to stay flat at 3.8%.For monitoring the impact of the results, consider this type of setup so you can keep an eye on all markets at once.XRP has its DaySince altseason began, many clients have been asking me about the lack of participation from XRP. Indeed, even though many altcoins had a turn to pump over the last few weeks, Ripple had been feeling kind of left out.Well, that seems to have changed this morning as XRP (blue line) has outperformed during the morning\u2019s Asian session ramp.Way to go!! Glad to see some double-digit gains there.If you\u2019re looking for something to watch over the weekend. Feel free to tune in to bloxlive.tv who are covering what looks like a very exciting bitcoin conference in Malta called Understanding BTC.Kicking off the event, three of the biggest names in crypto \u2013 Adam Back, Tone Vays and Giacomo Zucco \u2013 joined my favorite crypto anchor Jessica Walker for an excellent panel discussion. Watch it here.Spoiler alert. Tone Vays is still bearish, while Adam and Giacomo are taking a more long term outlook.The way I see though, Tuesday\u2019s action really wiped the slate clean. Order books across exchanges that had been building up for weeks are now clear. The only thing left to drive the price is sentiment.

Let\u2019s take a look at Ethereum price analysis as ETH and BTC appear to be taking a breather in preparation for the next move.Ethereum Price Analysis: Market ReviewBitcoin\u2019s explosive move to $5,300 assisted Ethereum in its run up to $180. This helped set ETH price firmly back on the weekly uptrend. The weekly chart shows ETH positioned outside the upper arm of the Bollinger band indicator, a first since reaching all-time highs in January 2018. Weekly Chart4-Hour ChartThe next hurdle will be $225 and ETH 00 appears indecisive as BTC remains pinned to $5k. The successive dojo candles on the 4-hour chart and declining buy volume are keeping Ethereum price trapped below strong resistance at $165 where it has been rejected multiple times. ETH is currently resting on the 61.8% Fib retracement line and above the ascending trendline with support at $162 and $160. Generally, ETH is well situated and has held support from the low of the dump at $150. The RSI is relatively flat in bullish territory. The CMF is beginning to rise and the Stoch is on the verge of dipping into bearish territory. Traders should observe the CMF and volume to keep an eye on funds flowing into ETH. 1 Hour ChartThe hourly chart: Ethereum price remains above the 20ma on the Bollinger band indicator and the altcoin needs to gain above the upper arm at $167.89 and the 78.6% $170 Fib retracement level in order to have a second go at $180. Overall ETH appears to be in step with Bitcoin and is likely to follow the path selected by the largest digital asset. Traders anticipating a Bitcoin price lead breakout could purchase at $164.50 with a stop loss right below to break even in the event that ETH takes a turn for the worse.

If that\u2019s the same guy who called the end of Bitcoin\u2019s last parabolic advance at $20k, predicting an 80%+ decline to under $4000, you listen extra hard.Well, pin back your ears, because Peter Brandt has something to say\u2026 or rather tweet, because\u2026 you know, nobody says anything anymore.Bitcoin Price: It\u2019s All In The ChartsBrandt suggests that the current chart is a rough analog of the double bottom in 2015. This bottom followed the crash from Bitcoin\u2019s previous parabolic move, which peaked in late 2013.With this in mind, Brandt believes that either from the December 2018 low (of $3130) or a retest of this value Bitcoin could well be entering a new parabolic phase\u2026 which would be nice.In the comments of his tweet, someone asked if Brandt had seen the parabolic analysis of Bitcoinist\u2019s own market analyst filbfilb. However, he replied that he preferred to keep his opinion pure.It\u2019s Been A Long Time ComingThe return to a parabolic advancing phase for bitcoin price has been predicted ever since the last one finished. In fact, looking back to that time gives a very interesting perspective.Bitcoinist was referencing \u2018a MarketWatch source known as Filbfilb\u2019, described at the time by fellow-analyst, Parabolic Trav, as very accurate. No wonder we hunted him down, and now keep him safely in a box, only getting him out periodically for Bitcoin TAs.And what was Peter Brandt saying at the time?Violation of parabolic advance could produce 12-24 mos of chop before new advance gains traction.13 months of (mainly downward) chop later\u2026 and according to Brandt the new advance could be starting to gain traction. I wouldn\u2019t bet against it.If bitcoin does indeed enter a \u201cnew parabolic advance\u201d then the chart suggests that a price of $100,000 USD could well be in play.Will Bitcoin price go on another parabolic run similar to the one in 2017?

Emilio Janus | Apr 07, 2019 | 06:00 Share Tweet Send Share Analysts have been repeatedly (and incorrectly) calling the Bitcoin price bottom for over a year now, pretty much since prices started falling. So before diving headlong back into its murky waters, how can we be sure things are different this time?Comparison To Other Bubble BottomsOne way might be to look at great bottoms from history (I\u2019m gonna let you make your own jokes) for comparison. That could seem like a reasonable place to start, at any rate. So what do we find?In terms of value, bitcoin price has lost more from its peak than all of these bubbles other than the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1929. And in terms of speed, we would have hit bottom harder than all but Oil (2008) and Chinese Stocks (2015).Of these examples, the NASDAQ bounced back hard, to double in the five years after bottom. However, the Japanese stock market crash led to a period of economic stagnation known as the lost decade/score. So it seems there is no consensus on how to judge bottoms, and how they will then play out.And anyway, if Bitcoin was incomparable to any other bubble, why compare bottoms?Comparison To Bitcoin Bubble BottomsPerhaps we\u2019d be better off making comparisons with previous Bitcoin bubbles and bottoms? Although we have less data to go on, this is not the first Bitcoin bubble, and at least we are comparing like for like.So, of Bitcoin\u2019s four bubbles (and at least three bottoms) thus far, how does this one compare?Well, we\u2019ve lost 84% of value from the peak, which is within the 83%-94% range of previous bottoms. According to veteran trader, Peter Brandt, the current chart is a rough analog of 2015\u2019s \u2018double bottom\u2019, suggesting that another potential parabolic breakout could happen again if history does indeed rhyme.A chart of Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) from analyst, plan\u20bf\u200f, shows a value of 50 and rising. This is also comparable to 2015\u2019s bottom.The analyst also re-iterated a tweet from last month of five key indicators why bitcoin would not drop below $2000. All of the indicators have become even stronger in the past month, which brought BTC a month closer to next years reward halving. The halving has also historically seen large price increases in the year running up to it.But all of the indicators and historical data in the world cannot \u2018guarantee\u2019 that bitcoin has bottomed. They do however, \u2018indicate\u2019 quite clearly that things could indeed be different this time.Recent gains and the subsequent holding of these positions have made bitcoin a pleasant place to play again. By the time the BTC/USD bottom has been truly confirmed, bitcoin price will be well on its way back upwards. So do you take the plunge?

Bitcoin\u2019s Hourly EMA Ribbon Providing SupportOn the one-hour chart for Bitcoin, the exponential moving average (EMA) ribbon has, thus far, provided significant support for the price of BTC.Bitcoin chart provided by TradingView.The bitcoin price only dropped below the EMA ribbon once, on April 4 for a few hours, since commencing on its uber-bullish breakout rally. Since then, the ribbon has held strong as support for Bitcoin (BTC). This strong support has undoubtedly assisted in the price jumping up in recent hours.Bitcoin\u2019s Weekly EMA Ribbon Under SiegeBitcoin\u2019s recent price surge has, thus far, topped out almost exactly at the upper band of the weekly EMA ribbon. However, price continues to knock on the door, with the bulls working hard to get a weekly close above $5400. Such a weekly close would be exceptionally bullish but nonetheless remains a tall order.Weekly Stochastic RSI Refuses to Come DownOne potentially alarming factor for the sustainability of this impressive bitcoin rally is the fact that the weekly Stochastic Relative Strength Index (Stochastic RSI) refuses to come down from its extremely overbought levels. Instead, it is simply moving sideways while remaining maxed out.What goes up most certainly must come down, but the Stochastic RSI is far from the be-all-end-all of technical indicators. The bitcoin price could well keep surging towards what will undoubtedly prove to be a staunch resistance at $6,000 before the weekly Stochastic RSI comes back down to Earth.Where Does Bitcoin Price Go From Here?Nobody has a crystal ball, but it stands to reason that bitcoin could very well continue to rally as FOMO (fear of missing out) continues to build. However, there remains very little chance that the price of BTC will be able to sustain levels above $5,500 for very long without a corrective move.The $6,000 mark will almost certainly provide extremely strong resistance. Should price reach this point, a profit-taking event or corrective move is probable. Such a move could potentially turn out to be a significant shakeout before truly confirming a bull run \u2014 but such speculation on the future movements of Bitcoin are purely educated guesswork at this stage.Trade Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

Let\u2019s take a look at the implications of this unprecedented move for the world\u2019s biggest exchange. \u2018Satoshi\u2019s Vision\u2019 Should Have Seen It ComingYesterday, the biggest bitcoin exchange by volume, Binance, announced it would delist Bitcoin SV (BSV) in a stunning move. Citing the failure to meet high standards, CEO Changpeng \u2018CZ\u2019 Zhao pulled the plug on the altcoin claiming to be the \u2018original\u2019 Bitcoin.CZ first issued a warning last week after BSV financiers Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre threatened to sue a member of the Bitcoin community for libel.\u201cCraig Wright is not Satoshi,\u201d Zhao retaliated. \u201cAnymore of this sh!t, we delist!\u201dBut the sh!t kept flowing. Ayre and some other BSV supporters even urged the CEO to follow through with the threat calling Binance \u201ca scammy bucket shop.\u201dFinally, Binance dropped the bomb on Monday, which CZ said was \u201cthe right thing\u201d to do.The news was largely received with praise by online commentators. Ayre, however, was indignant calling the move \u201cunlawful.\u201dKraken Will Likely Delist SV NextAs Bitcoinist reported, last week, Morgan Creek cofounder Anthony Pompliano called on every major exchange to delist BSV \u201csimultaneously\u201d on May 1st.But with Binance pulling the trigger much earlier, other companies are already following suit.Blockchain announced it would drop support by May 15th. \u201cAfter careful consideration, we have determined to end all support of BSV within the Blockchain Wallet by May 15, 2019,\u201d they wrote.Shapeshift also jumped on the bandwagon delisting the altcoin much sooner.\u201cWe stand with Binance and CZ\u2019s sentiments,\u201d wrote CEO Erik Voorhees.We\u2019ve decided to delist Bitcoin SV from Shapeshift within 48 hrs.Bitcoin exchange Kraken, meanwhile, revealed it\u2019s also considering taking action. It posted a public poll asking whether BSV should be removed.With over 61 thousand respondents so far, the results suggest that Kraken will be the next major exchange to drop BSV. Overwhelmingly, more than 70 percent said that Kraken should delist the altcoin saying, \u201cYes, it\u2019s toxic.\u201dInterestingly, Kraken may have even more reason to remove BSV. As Bitcoinist reported last December the exchange was sued by UnitedCorp over an alleged complot to hijack the Bitcoin Cash network following a highly contested hard-fork that spawned BSV.4 Reasons Why Binance Will BenefitUltimately, the decision to drop BSV could bring a slew of benefit for the world\u2019s biggest exchange for many reasons.First, BSV trading volume on the platform was negligible. With Binance supporting hundreds of altcoins, dropping such a low volume coin will not hurt their business.In fact, the number of actual BSV users is dwarfed even by its forked rival BCH. Its hash rate, despite courting miners, is a minuscule 1.6 percent of Bitcoin\u2019s. Moreover, Bitcoin SV price 00 plunged immediately following the news by over 20 percent revealing its tenuous market presence.Second, the delisting gained Binance a lot of \u2018street cred\u2019 from the community. By removing a coin that was synonymous with lawsuits, fraud and \u2018Faketoshi,\u2019 the exchange sets a precedent of industry self-regulation.Third, it establishes Binance as the de facto leader among exchanges. By following through with his warning, the CEO demonstrated that he will defend his principles like a true leader is expected to do.Fourth, BSV is now a pariah. This means that other exchanges who *do not* delist it moving forward will lose credibility in the eyes of the public, further strengthening Binance\u2019s position.It will also discourage exchanges from listing questionable Bitcoin-branded \u2018forks\u2019 in the future.Case in point:JUST IN: @Gemini never listed $BSV in the first place.\u2014 Tyler Winklevoss (@tylerwinklevoss) April 15, 2019Will delisting BSV benefit Binance in the long run?

Bitcoinist got its hands on the hefty product, and we\u2019re a big fan. Here is our full CRYPTOTAG review. DesignOne CRYPTOTAG is essentially two sheets of space-grade titanium that clip together with titanium clips. It is compatible with Ledger, TREZOR, KeepKey, Jaxx, Exodus, and others wallets. The product is also fireproof up to 1665\u00b0C, corrosion and erosion resistant, and professes to be able to stop a bullet.The outside of the CRYPTOTAG proudly displays the products\u2019 logo and name \u2014 which looks cool but makes the sensitive \u2018document\u2019 less discrete. Should it ever catch the eyes of a potential thief, he or she would have little doubt as to what kind of information the sheet holds. (Even if someone has no idea what a recovery seed is, most people know that \u201ccrypto\u201d means money.)Of course, a wise user would never leave a CRYPTOTAG in sight \u2014 just as one would never leave their gold coins or valuables lying about. Still, a little more discretion would\u2019ve been an added bonus.Aside from that, there is very little to fault with the CRYPTOTAG, which we find to be the best storage solution for your private keys available today.Set UpEverything you need to use the CRYPTOTAG is included in the box. The full package comes with a hefty hammer, 26 letter bits, an anvil, a bit holder, earplugs, and even a box of matches to burn your paper recovery seed when finished.What sets the CRYPTOTAG apart from its biggest competitor \u2014 the CryptoSteel \u2014 is the fact that its set up is downright fun!To forever store your recovery phrase in a CRYPTOTAG, the owner must physically hammer each letter into the titanium sheet individually. While playing blacksmith might sound tedious to some, we at Bitcoinist found the process quite enjoyable. Heck, the act of physically hammering in the recovery seed to your son\u2019s potential crypto legacy could be construed as downright therapeutic!The process is also not particularly difficult but requires concentration.

Hey bitcoiners, let\u2019s prove to the french authorities Bitcoin can be an amazing way to send funds quickly, without border (sic) and for a good cause[.]Raymond was referencing Macron\u2019s almost immediate promise to repair the extensive damage, which includes a collapsed roof and spire.Joining him since are various entities, with French billionaires alone saying they would contribute \u20ac350 million to the efforts. Others were noticeably hands-off in their approach, with Australia\u2019s prime minister coming in for criticism after refusing to support the country\u2019s own donation fund.\u201cI\u2019m sure that President Macron is able to deal with this as is the Catholic Church and, if individual Australians want to do something, well, it\u2019s a free country \u2013 they can do whatever they like,\u201d Scott Morrison said.Bitcoin Community Rallies Round AgainBitcoin users are meanwhile no strangers to fundraising rallies, a sense of community spirit already prevailing as the community helps one of its members fight a highly-controversial legal battle this month.As Bitcoinist reported, Lightning Torch organizer Hodlonaut found himself the victim of a lawsuit threat from self-confessed Satoshi Nakamoto Craig Wright. Wright is claiming Hodlonaut insulted and spread misinformation about him in rejected the idea Wright created Bitcoin on social media.The lawsuit appeared to shock many, with Twitter users coming out in a show of solidarity with Hodlonaut and many cryptocurrency exchanges subsequently removing support for Wright\u2019s Bitcoin SV token. Paris has also stepped up its public awareness of Bitcoin this year, Bitcoinist reporting on cryptic public art projects involving hidden Bitcoin wallets, complete with prize money for the first person to solve piece together the clues. In January, a nationwide roll-out of Bitcoin purchases via France\u2019s network of tobacco kiosks began despite mixed messages from authorities over their support of the idea.Will you donate to Notre Dame with Bitcoin?

Bitcoinist | Apr 16, 2019 | 07:00 Share Tweet Send Share There are various technical indicators which are important for identifying different trends in the movement of the price of certain assets. Bitcoin is not an exception. Perhaps one of the most popular, as well as often-used one of them is the moving average. It\u2019s fairly easy to calculate and once you plot it on a chart, it becomes a very prominent trend-spotting took, hence, why it is so important.What is a Moving Average (MA)?A moving average is an average price for a certain asset over a specified period of time. One of the most popular MAs is the 200-day moving average.In order to calculate Bitcoin\u2019s 200-day MA, one would have to take the closing prices of Bitcoin for the last 200 days and add them together. This number is then divided by 200. In order to continue to calculate the MA on a daily basis, one would only have to replace the oldest number with the most recent closing price.Irrespective of the time period, the calculations are always the same. It\u2019s also important to note that traders can also use different prices to get moving averages on a shorter or longer time frame \u2014 such as weekly, monthly, opening, or even intraday prices.Why is the 200-Day MA Important?As we mentioned in the beginning, moving averages are oftentimes used to identify a certain pattern or a trend in the movement of the price.When the current price of a trading asset crosses below the moving average line, this can signal that bears are in control of the price action and, as such, you could interpret this as an indicator for assets further decline. Naturally, if the price crosses above the 200-day MA line, it could potentially signal that bulls are dictating the price action again, at least for a certain period.Evolve.Markets is a trading platform using MetaTrader 5 trading software, offering most advanced functions and technical analysis tools. Traders are able to use a wide range of indicators in order to plot their further actions and determine their positions.Using the 200-Day MA Indicator: Entry and Exit PointsBesides identifying trends, moving averages can also be used to find entry and exit market points. In other words, traders can use these indicators to determine whether to invest or to liquidate existing positions.One of the simplest trading strategies relies on the crossing of two, or, eventually, more moving average lines. The most basic signal is provided when the shorter-term moving average crosses above or below the longer-term moving average line.So, if you\u2019re using the 200-Day MA as a powerful indicator, a cross of a shorter-term MA (such as the 50-day MA), above it, could signal that a bullish trend might be developing, hence providing a good entry point for a long position.Using the 200-Day MA Indicator: Identifying Support and ResistanceAnother very good use of the 200-Day MA as a strong technical indicator is to signal early support or resistance levels.For instance, if the price of Bitcoin tends to drift lower in a well-established uptrend, it wouldn\u2019t be that surprising for it to find support at the long-term 200-day MA.Of course, if the price tends to trend lower, a lot of the traders will be looking for the price to bounce off the resistance of the 200-day MA, which is considered to be a rather major one.Wrapping it upThe 200-day MA is one of the most powerful trend-spotting indicators because it paints the bigger picture. It provides long-term historic data of the price action and when plotted correctly, could be used for crafting a viable trading strategy.It provides traders with the crucial tool to identify a current trend or to spot a trend reversal. It can also be used as a signal for incoming support of resistance level. Naturally, the way traders choose to use the 200-day MA is entirely up to them, based on their previous trading experience.What do you think about the 200-day moving average?

The network now has a total payment capacity of 1062 BTC ($5.37 million), having reached an all-time high of 1080 BTC earlier this month. Designed to allow off-chain Bitcoin transactions which are almost instant and free, Lightning has come on leaps and bounds since it debuted on the Bitcoin mainnet at the start of 2018. As Bitcoinist reported, frenetic development soon spawned publicity campaigns and endorsements from well-known tech figures, most notably Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.A transaction relay, Lightning Torch, further aimed to raise funds for the plight of Venezuelan citizens while stress testing the nascent network, a test it passed without technical difficulties. Breez CEO: Lightning Use Must Be UnconsciousAccording to the developers of one new Lightning product, however, the experimental nature of the protocol means it \u2013 and Bitcoin generally \u2013 will stay a niche phenomenon unless they are reimagined for the non-technical user. Breez, an all-in-one Lightning wallet, payment platform and merchant service, aims to do just that, its creators claim. Currently in beta as an Android app, Breez attempts to remove the technical hurdles involved in using Lightning in its current form.With its solution, users no longer need to open channels, run a node or create invoices manually, something which involves technical knowledge. \u201cBreez runs on the Lightning Network, with its benefits of speed and economy, but it\u2019s non-custodial and requires zero configuration on the part of the user,\u201d the company\u2019s co-founder and CEO Roy Sheinfeld wrote in a blog post April 8. The Breez hub opens and funds the payment channel automatically, letting users start transferring and receiving payments from any entity on the Lightning Network as easily as they would send a text message. If you can download the mobile client, you can understand how to use it.As Bitcoinist noted, Dorsey himself plans to give Lightning a mainstream break via its incorporation into his payment network Square. A dedicated spin-off, Square Crypto, is currently hiring blockchain developers.Other consumer-oriented offerings have already appeared, serving limited sectors such as those wishing to order Domino\u2019s pizza with Lightning.\u201cUntil casual users can use it to buy pizza and Netflix without thinking about it, bitcoin won\u2019t become the currency it was always meant to be,\u201d Sheinfeld added.What do you think about the Lightning Network and products like Breez?

Backed by the blockchain infrastructure provider Ambisafe and the US Capital Global investment bank, the fund is set to acquire SpaceX shares and distribute rights to receive income from them by the issue of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. When shares are not publicly tradedThe reason for the creation of such a fund is that many retail investors strive to participate in the growth of SpaceX. Being the first private company to successfully launch a spacecraft in 2010, SpaceX won actual supply contracts from NASA and certified for US military launches. Today, the company has reached its $31 billion valuation and has long-term contracts in the area of commercial cargo services and crew development.Being highly demanded for investment in the secondary market, the company though remains unattainable for small contributors: its shares are not publicly traded on the stock exchanges like NYSE or NASDAQ.The giant has enough reasons to be closed. First of all, to be free from unnecessary buzz because of those who want to make a profit by reselling the shares. Secondly, publicity often entails the complexity of management and communication with stakeholders. In a situation with thousands of investors, transaction maintenance and administration cost outweigh the profits. Finally, there are a lot of legal restrictions. In the US only qualified investors declaring a monthly income of $200,000 or owing assets starting at $1 million are allowed to acquire company securities. The EU\u2019s laws also imply a number of similar restrictions.Getting in with only $100Given these conditions, the retail investor does not seem to have any options to get in. That\u2019s why Unicorn Equities took to change the situation for the better by issuing the token which represents an economic interest in Elon Musk\u2019s company.USPX token which represents a share in the fund, is distributed through Orderbook, a specially-designed decentralized platform with integrated KYC verification. As stated on the platform website, token holders are expected to get financial returns, equivalent to what owners of the shares get. Every time the company valuation increases, token holders would be able to trade their tokens at the new price. Once SpaceX goes public, the fund will sell underlying shares and distribute proceeds among token holder cryptocurrency wallets.\u201cThe model is so simple that it opens the secondary market for those who are ready to pass the entry threshold of as little as $100. We believe shares on the blockchain is the best option to allow retail investors globally to own economic interest in SpaceX,\u201d Andrew Zamovsky, CEO Ambisafe says.As Ambisafe states, administration and legality of the process are supported by the Regulatory Aware Protocol (RAP) which allows the fund to comply with legislation in various jurisdictions without any contradiction with SpaceX\u2019 policy.Upon completion of the token sale, Unicorn Equities promises to publish reports confirming its ownership of the SpaceX derivatives.

This would mark the end of a bear market, which started in December 2017.The MM indicator is a simple ratio of the price of Bitcoin to its 200-day moving average price. A low MM ratio is indicative of bear market periods. It suggests a trend reversal when the ratio reaches the 1.0 boundary point.Historical patterns are usually an important aspect of deducing future BTC price action. In previous cycles, the MM moving above 1.0 marked the end of a Bitcoin market.

Veteran trader and analyst, Peter Brandt who called the 80 percent drop of 2018 thinks BTC looks set to enter another \u201cparabolic\u201d growth phase.For bitcoin investor Trace Mayer, 2021 could see Bitcoin go as high as $100,000 to $250,000. Many analysts say the upcoming 2020 halving will also create an additional tailwind for a more bullish upward lift based on historical precedents.In a previous Bitcoinist article, Tom Lee of Fundstrat predicted that BTC would top $10,000 in 2019.Now, all eyes will be on BTC/USD to see if the accumulation and sideways phase continues, or if bitcoin does indeed skyrocket to the moon.Is the Bitcoin bear market over?

For example, several of Brazil\u2019s Bitcoin exchanges, such as Bitcoin Market, have had their bank accounts closed because judges have ruled that traditional banks can terminate cryptocurrency exchange accounts at will.Most recently, Santander Bank arbitrarily terminated the account of the Bitcoin Max exchange. After a court battle, a judge denied Bitcoin Max\u2019s motion to reopen its bank account.

French Finance Minister: Ours is the Right WayFrance\u2019s Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire says the EU should consider adopting the country\u2019s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. Speaking at the ongoing Paris Blockchain Week Summit on Monday (April 15, 2019), Le Maire, opined:I will propose to my European partners that we set up a single regulatory framework on crypto-assets inspired by the French experience. Our model is the right one.Le Maire\u2019s comments continue to indicate his change of stance regarding cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Since 2018, the country has been pushing for the enactment of cryptocurrency regulations.Earlier in April 2019, the parliament in France passed into law, a set of rules for the country\u2019s cryptocurrency scene. The regulations mainly covered licensure and tax regulations.Based on the new regulatory framework virtual currency brokers and token issuers can apply to the country\u2019s market regulator for operating licenses. Also, everyone involved in the industry, from issuers to custodians, and even traders and investors will have to pay taxes on profits made from dealing cryptocurrencies.For France, one primary objective of the new regulatory paradigm is to identify industry participants. Apart from know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, French regulators also want to verify the identity of token issuers and crypto brokers as a way of combating money laundering and eliminating fraudulent companies.The European Commission has consistently called for a unified regulatory paradigm across the bloc. However, not much progress has been made on that front.Many stakeholders within the EU have also identified the need for a unified cryptocurrency regulatory code for the region. Such a move they say eliminates the patchwork of virtual currency laws that could potentially create regulatory arbitrage within the EU member states.Calls for Streamlined Digital Laws in the EULe Maire\u2019s call comes at a time when Margrethe Vestager, the EU Competitions Commissioner is also trying to nudge the EU into moving forward with creating a regulatory framework for digital tax.Earlier in April, Vestager declared that the EU need not to wait for a global consensus before implementing its own digital tax regime.Vestager, the ex-Danish economy minister, also known for being tough on Silicon Valley companies operating in Europe says tech giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple (\u201cGAFA\u201d) should pay their fair share of taxes in Europe.It remains to be seen whether Vestager\u2019s digital tax proposal will extend to cryptocurrency companies.Do you think the EU should adopt the French cryptocurrency regulations?

Bitcoin Price $5K Consolidation a \u2018Positive Sign\u2019According to a new report by BitBullCapital, a cryptocurrency hedge funds manager,\u201dthe fact that Bitcoin has managed to retain gains from early April is a very positive sign.Moreover, CEO Joe DiPasquale outlines that the bitcoin price 00 is seeing consolidation above $5,000. If this continues for another week or two, it could lead up to a shot at the $5,500 level.Going further, the report reiterates that the latest BTC/USD rally was caused by a large order, which was executed simultaneously on multiple exchanges and was likely an algorithmic one.Notedly, such a move should have been viewed with a certain skepticism as it\u2019s not organic or steady in its nature. However, it brought back substantial market momentum, which is considered to be a positive sign.It\u2019s worth noting, though, that Bitcoinist reported that another reason for the latest rally might be hidden in the increased activity across the board, as data shows that the number of active wallets has risen by as much as 40-60 percent.This, with a significant uptick in institutional interest, are also likely the reasons why Bitcoin managed to sustain the recent gains.But 2017-Type Run \u2018Not in the Near Future\u2019On the other hand, the cryptocurrency hedge fund also believes that a run similar to that back in 2017 is unlikely to be seen \u201cin the near future.\u201dIt notes that for this to happen, there needs to be a major catalyst such as \u201cglobal governmental approval and integration with mainstream services and portals.\u201d\u2026[W]e do not believe a run similar to the 2017 drive can be seen again, at least not in the near future and particularly not in the absence of major catalysts such as global governmental approval and integration with mainstream services and portals\u2026 [W]e do expect steady growth in the years the come, building the foundation for a surge when the timing is right.DiPasquale also says that there is a real risk for the cryptocurrency failing to maintain its current range and to retest the $5,000 level in the coming weekend if the trading volume starts to drop. Reads the report:If $5,000 breaks, we are likely to see support around $4,700 \u2013 $4,800 and reconsider market sentiment and fundamentals.However, Bitcoinist reported that the Mayer Multiple by Trace Mayer, a key indicator which called 2015\u2019s bottom, is flashing again, suggesting that the price may have already bottomed.Other Cryptocurrencies Would BenefitOn another note, it also outlines that an increase in Bitcoin\u2019s price could also cause other cryptocurrencies, especially those closely related to it, to surge as well.This already happened with Litecoin, which gained upwards of 55 percent following Bitcoin\u2019s rally.The cryptocurrency has since lost some of its gains but is still substantially higher than prices from last month.BitBull Capital manages cryptocurrency hedge funds, and is the \u201cthe first cryptocurrency fund of funds,\u201d BitBull Fund manages a strategically selected bundle of 10 of the more than 600 crypto hedge funds for its investors, including gaining access to exclusive, closed funds and $M-minimum funds.What do you think of the recent report?

As Bitcoinist reported, Sweden is set on replacing its dwindling cash supply with a digital version of the krona \u2013 one which would constitute a wholly-centralized digital currency.The aim, proponents say, is to reduce the country\u2019s reliance on the private financial sector. Without a government-issued digital currency, payments in Sweden would almost entirely occur via third party processors.\u201cIf cash stopped working, it would leave all individuals to rely on the private sector for access to money and payment methods. It would be a historical change without precedence,\u201d the deputy governor of the central bank told the World Economic Forum in November.The private sector\u2019s firm but controversial grip on payments returned to the spotlight this month in nearby United Kingdom, where prosecutors reopened a giant \u00a314 billion ($18.25 billion) lawsuit against MasterCard. Should it be successful, around 46 million UK residents may be entitled to a payout from the payment processor of around \u00a3300 ($390) each. For Swedish authorities meanwhile, Bitcoin has traditionally constituted a cause for concern. In January, one trader received a tax bill for almost $1 million after the tax department decided to treat his activities as business-related rather than private. The figure, the trader claimed, amounted to more than 300 percent of his total profits. What do you think about Sweden\u2019s Bitcoin hack?

Hyperinflation Bites Bitcoin TradersData from monitoring resource Coin.Dance \u2014 which tracks trading volumes on P2P platforms Localbitcoins, Paxful, and Bisq \u2014 shows total volumes in Venezuela on Localbitcoins reached 35.9 billion sovereign bolivars (VES) for the week ending April 27. That number marks the highest in history according to the site\u2019s records, the weekly performance squarely beating the previous high of 31.3 billion VES set two weeks prior. This week\u2019s record, however, differed from the past. As Bitcoinist reported, the hyperinflation affecting Venezuela\u2019s fledgling national currency is forecast to hit 8 million percent in 2019. In line with that worrying trend, the bolivars transacted through Localbitcoins last week actually totaled significantly less in BTC terms than previous weeks. The 35.9 billion VES was equivalent to 1208 BTC ($6.23 million), while the 31.3 billion VES from earlier in April 1454 BTC (currently $7.5 million), Coin.Dance suggests.More And More Choose Bitcoin SafetyThe dubious record came as Venezuela\u2019s government and partially-recognized president Nicolas Maduro renewed calls for foreign investors to inject cash into the country\u2019s embattled economy. In a live address last week, Maduro specifically appealed to overseas parties to buy up his administration\u2019s controversial cryptocurrency, Petro. Ostensibly tied to Venezuela\u2019s oil reserves and debuting with a $5.9 billion market cap, critics immediately lambasted Petro when it appeared last year. Among its inadequacies, research showed Venezuela\u2019s state oil company had debts multiple times the size of Petro\u2019s market cap. In the interim period, various governments have sanctioned Petro altogether, barring their citizens from investing. Meanwhile, the trend set by Venezuela continues to play out across neighboring South American economies. As Bitcoinist previously noted, Colombia, Peru and chiefly Argentina have also set higher Bitcoin trading volumes in recent months. In March, Tim Draper, a major Bitcoin bull and famous for his sky-high Bitcoin price forecasts, even met with Argentina\u2019s president to discuss the economy and reportedly made a Bitcoin bet with him. \u201c[I]f the peso is valued more than Bitcoin, I double the investment I am making in the country; and if Bitcoin acquires more value than the peso\u2026 that would be a perfect solution because there is no confidence in the currency,\u201d the mogul said about the plan quoted by a local news agency. Meanwhile, In Mexico\u2026Elsewhere on the continent, citizens are turning to Bitcoin in greater numbers for other reasons. The US\u2019 threat to cut off remittances to Mexico, for example, coincided with an uptick in Bitcoin activity, as workers eye the possibility of using a borderless currency to continue their activities unhindered. Mexico\u2019s overall volumes remain comparatively low, with 56 BTC ($288,000) changing hands on Localbitcoins last week.What do you think about Venezuela\u2019s Bitcoin trading volume?

As more devices are connected and communicate with each other, there becomes a need for payment providers. IOTA aims to be the standardized settlement system for IoT machine to machine (m2m) payments.Rather than a blockchain, IOTA utilizes a distributed ledger technology called \u2018the Tangle\u2019. This overcomes some of the inefficiencies of traditional blockchains and enables the fee-less transfer of tokens and/or data.IOTA co-founder, Dominik Schiener, explained that the smart wallet technology could easily be adapted into all new vehicles:IOTA wants to enable interoperability with all these different players. So there is no Jaguar coin, no BMW coin, but one universal token for this machine economy.The IOTA price jumped 15 percent following Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s announcement, from around $0.27 to $0.31.What do you think about Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s plans to reward drivers with IOTA?

Very possibly due to the results of Spain\u2019s elections, which saw a surprise victory for the socialist party.All things considered though, markets are still pretty calm and volatility remains low as we await earnings reports from Alphabet this evening and Apple tomorrow. Facebook, Amazon, and Netflix all smashed their respective first-quarter earnings, so things are looking pretty good for the FAANG group so far.Smashed GrowthOn Friday, the United States reported its biggest growth beat since 2010. Analysts were expecting to see GDP growth figures chug in at 2.2% but instead, the numbers surprised to by a full percentage point higher at 3.2%.This graph shows the Advance GDP in blue and the analyst forecast in gold.This is the latest sign that the US economy is doing really great at the moment, at least from a macro perspective. Pressure is now back on the Fed as it will be difficult for them to justify a policy of patience with figures looking this good. They may soon be forced into further monetary tightening, especially since stock markets are once again breaking new record highs.Crypto Winter is OverInvestor interest has been picking up again in the crypto market in a big way.There have been some phenomenal gains in many crypto assets since the market lows of mid-December, but that\u2019s not specifically what I\u2019m talking about right now.During an interview, I once heard Jeff Bezos responding to Amazon\u2019s price crash when the tech bubble popped. Amazon shares went from triple digits to single digits in a matter of months but Jeff was unfazed. He says, and I\u2019m paraphrasing, the stock price crashing only affects companies that are trying to raise capital but we already had all the money we needed.

In this case, we can already see signs that investor confidence in the crypto industry is rising rapidly.Bitcoin.com came out with an article this morning that highlights a few projects that are seeing a rush of investor interest but what really caught my attention is this\u2026The VC firm Andreessen Horowitz has been responsible for funding some of the biggest tech startups in the world and the fact that they\u2019re going big on crypto inspires me with great confidence.Outperforming today has been IOTA, who just announced an interesting partnership with Jaguar Land Rover.Now, we have heard a few of these type of announcements before that turned out to be fake news but this one appears to be genuine.

As a Forbes contributor, Chilton wrote a couple of pieces for the publication highlighting the strengths and areas of improvements that the blockchain could take.Chilton\u2019s most popular article on the blockchain was a piece for Forbes titled \u201cBohemian Blockchain Rhapsody: lessons to be learned from Queen & Freddie.\u201d In his piece, Chilton drew parallels between the blockchain and the 1970\u2019s hit song.\u2018Get Creative\u2019Chilton began by surmising his position with the following:At the same time, there are lessons to be learned from Queen and Freddie.

We\u2019ve spoken a lot about decentralized applications already, these new type of networks, in my opinion, have the potential to disrupt even the largest centralized tech companies including the FAANGS. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are still a fairly new concept but according to a recent report, they\u2019re far from infallible. Researchers have now laid out how high-frequency traders are currently taking advantage of retail customers on DEX platforms by paying higher miner fees to get priority transactions.To be fair, this type of action is also known to occur in traditional markets. A popular book called Flash Boys explores the phenomenon of high-frequency arbitrage at great length.Overall, decentralized exchanges and decentralized applications for that matter, are still a very new concept and there\u2019s no way that all of the world\u2019s problems will be solved in a few lines of code. For those currently using a DEX, you might be able to reduce the risk of being arbitraged by paying a higher miner fee.

He starts off by saying that the Fed has no tools left to fight a recession because rates are currently too low and concludes that the Fed should start lowering rates already now, just in case a recession comes. My brain hurts.Fortunately, this is not the Fed\u2019s base case at the moment. We also heard from two other Fed members yesterday who seemed dovish, but a bit more level-headed. Evens said that rates will likely remain flat until at least 2020 and Rosengren argued against negative interest rates.Bitcoin IshtPersonally, I try to stay away from politics as much as possible, but often politics move markets.

Masayoshi Son was dubbed \u201cJapan\u2019s Warren Buffet\u201d in an opinion piece posted by Nikkei Asian Review. His company, Softbank, has invested over $100 billion into companies such as Uber, WeWork and other companies based in Silicon Valley.Son\u2019s investment experience apparently didn\u2019t prepare him for the massive whipsaw coming his way when the Bitcoin market overheated in 2017. According to The Wall Street Journal, Son bought into BTC as it neared its all-time high near $20,000. Son would later close his positions as the Bitcoin hysteria died down and lost USD $130 million in the aftermath.Remarking on Son\u2019s decision to invest in Bitcoin, Nikkei suggested that Son forgot \u201cBuffet\u2019s 101 lesson to never invest in something you don\u2019t understand.\u201dThe Pessimism of BillionairesBuffet himself has shown to be strongly anti-crypto in statements released to the media.

There is nothing being produced in the way of value in the asset.Also, in the past, Buffet has called bitcoin \u201crat poison squared.\u201d Although in October 2018 Buffet would have an apparent change of heart. As Bitcoinist reported, Buffet\u2019s Berkshire Hathway invested $600 million in two fintech payment firms that were not too distant from the blockchain landscape.These decisions by Buffet and Son show the divergence of opinion between business leaders as well as the broader views held between the eastern and western economies.Japan\u2019s Blockchain ParadoxIn the Nikkei Asian Review, Japan\u2019s position was described as a paradox as it attempts to strike a balance between innovation, accountability, and regulations.These facts were highlighted by the Mt.Gox hack that occurred in 2014 as well as the case of Coincheck in 2018. It\u2019s events like these that seemingly cause a need for tighter regulations and controls \u2014 while the Yen continues to compete with the dollar in top bitcoin trading.Nikkei also notes how the cultural differences between the countries could be impacting the growth of bitcoin in the country.Outlook Remains PositiveDespite these exchange hacks, setbacks, and national bureaucracy, the nation appears to be \u201con the right path.\u201dFor example, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in Japan is reportedly working closely with revised regulations to better protect investors.Furthermore, greater clarity around the legality of bitcoin and other virtual assets is expected by late June when international leaders meet in Japan for the G20 summit.

The suspension will take place from 9:30 AM EDT to 11:59 PM May 10. The SEC announced that this will be a temporary suspension of trading in the securities of Bitcoin Generation, a publically traded cryptocurrency exchange from Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Purportedly behind the suspension are key concerns about the accuracy and validity of information BTGN has put in the marketplace. Specifically, the regulator points to public statements over the viability of a bond BTGN allegedly acquired from a UK-based entity.Moreover, the amount of BTGN\u2019s outstanding common stock and promotional activity have been called into question. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also concerned over the impact that its promotional activity has on the market.

They should be extremely cautious when reviewing the information available, as well as any subsequent information issued by the company.

Address DetailsThe receiving address, (whose owner is unknown) has received smaller amounts of Bitcoin very recently.The address hash is 3JZq4atUahhuA9rLhXLMhhTo133J9rF97j .The address received four payments in total:77 BTC on April 28139 BTC on April 29332 BTC on April 29 (23 minutes later)And the largest transaction of 12,879 BTC on April 29 nearly 17 hours later.Without digging into the transaction history too much, the address appears to be a transitory account of sorts as the coins held are not kept in storage for very log.In total, the address had received 153,602 BTC while spending the total amount of coins the same day.Where did the coins go?The coins were sent to one address: 13Je1ECP9bmmwXGs4fnoLBTV4taayQe225 that would subsequently send the coins to two more addresses, namely: 1Kr6QSydW9bFQG1mXiPNNu6WpJGmUa9i1g and 3CMsmcjQiam5kzCgt5FEheS4SetLNZriZ5.The coins were then moved to tens of other accounts split over various denominations.So far, Bitfinex is yet to make a statement on the movement of the coins.Part of bigger losses?This was by far not the first time that a large sum of Bitcoin had been transferred from Bitfinex\u2019s reserves, as reported by Twitter user Whale Alert on April 26.\ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 \ud83d\udea8 13,377 #BTC (70,350,098 USD) transferred from #Bitfinex to unknown walletTx: https://t.co/giyoVxsISd\u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 26, 2019The unexplained movement of bitcoin from the Bitfinex wallets could be part of a larger controversy involving the exchange and its financial battle involving 17,000 bitcoin.As previously reported by Bitcoinist, Bitfinex un-thawed a total of $165 million from its cold wallet in just under 12 hours amid an uptick in customer withdrawals.In response, Bitfinex would transfer a BTC amount worth roughly $75 million.Bitfinex\u2019s bigger problemsDespite these large price movements, Bitfinex is fighting a much larger legal battle from the New York Attorney General\u2019s office. The exchange is fighting back against accusations of an $850m cover-up by the company, which Bitfinex says are \u201criddled with false assertions.\u201dThe NY Attorney General is accusing Bitfinex of losing $850m of customer funds, and that it used the platform\u2019s own stablecoin, Tether, to hide the companies\u2019 tracks. Bitfinex would later claim that its funds were \u201cseized and safeguarded\u201d and that it was working proactively to get the alleged funds released back to customers.The company would also go on to assure traders that its platform and Tether had the required liquidity, stating:Both Bitfinex and Tether are financially strong \u2013 full stop. And both Bitfinex and Tether are committed to fighting this gross overreach by the New York Attorney General\u2019s office against companies that are good corporate citizens and strong supporters of law enforcement. Bitfinex and Tether will vigorously challenge this, and any and all other actions, by the New York Attorney General\u2019s office.Other online commentators meanwhile quipped whether this may mean another \u2018version 2\u2019 bail-in exchange token from Bitfinex.Wen BFX Tokens v2?\u2014 Squeeze [LSK] (@cryptoSqueeze) April 30, 2019These speculations are apparently qualified as Bitfinex plans to launch an exchange token sale, as confirmed by major shareholder of Bitfinix Zhao Dong on the Weibo platform.Bitfinex does have a plan to issue its exchange token, but the details have not yet been finalized.

The move also hints that its retail travel giant parent-company Flight Centre Group could soon accept BTC company-wide.UK\u2019s Biggest Travel Management Company Accepts BitcoinCorporate Traveller is the UK\u2019s largest travel management company dedicated to partnering with companies with small \u2013 medium travel spend requirements.Now it will be accepting Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) payments for its services via third-party payment processor BitPay.Corporate Traveller UK General Manager, Andy Hegley said:We identified an increasing demand from our clients for the option to pay in Bitcoin for business travel bookings made by our travel consultants.\u201cWe chose BitPay to manage our merchant processing because they make it easy and handle the entire process of getting the Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash from the customer and depositing cash into our account,\u201d said Hegley.By using BitPay, Corporate Traveller won\u2019t be subject to bitcoin price volatility. The tradeoff, however, is that it won\u2019t benefit from Bitcoin network\u2019s speed (10-30 minutes) since BitPay\u2019s settlement into GBP will take about 2 business days.Ultimately, though, accepting bitcoin seems more like a PR move. BTC is merely just another payment option for the company who still receives fiat into their bank account without ever handling bitcoin.Hegley adds:The blockchain industry is growing exponentially and we are excited to be able to offer our clients the ability to pay in bitcoin, whilst having the reassurance of our settlement from BitPay being in pounds sterling.We believe Corporate Traveller is the first business travel management company to offer this payment option to SMEs in the UK.Flight Centre Travel Group Next?Corporate Traveller operates offices in 20 locations across the UK. At the same time, its parent company Flight Centre Travel Group (FCTG) is the largest retail travel service provider in Australia.The Brisbane-based retail travel outlet is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and has around 2,800 retail locations globally. Besides Australia and the UK, it has presence in New Zealand, United States, Canada, South Africa, Hong Kong, India, China, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, and Mexico.Corporate Traveller, therefore, is testing the waters for possible company-wide adoption of bitcoin.\u201cAll the time people ask if we accept Bitcoin\u2026 Mainly international students and tourists already here trying to book more flights,\u201d an employee at an Australian fight centre travel agency explained.Management knows about it, they\u2019ll probably see how it goes at Corporate Traveller, before they let our customers pay with Bitcoin.Travel Industry Pioneering Bitcoin AdoptionPaying with bitcoin for flights, hotels and travel services in general, has already been possible for years. One of the first companies to pioneer bitcoin acceptance since 2014 was CheapAir.Last year, CEO Jeff Klee told Bitcoinist that accepting bitcoin has been a \u201cpositive experience\u201d for the company, despite issues with third-party payment processors.Open-source (and self-hosted) solutions such as BTCPayServer can provide merchants with a more custom solution while retaining more control over the processing experience such as better fee estimation.Kllee explained:Every new payment method has its own challenges, but accepting Bitcoin has been quite a positive experience for CheapAir overall. Any technical challenges we\u2019ve faced have been overcome, and have mostly been met with patience and an overall team mentality from the BTC community.Other platforms such as Travelbybit, and even airlines such as Japan\u2019s Peach and AirBaltic have been accepting bitcoin for quite some time now.Klee also believes that \u201cthe longer crypto currencies are around, the more stable they seem and the more likely we\u2019ll see additional buy-in from other travel retailers.\u201dBefore long, crypto will just be another form of payment.

Despite being set for expansion due to a shortage of lithium, Afghanistan remains stifled when it comes to borrowing due to international restrictions. The answer, Asia Times paraphrases Central Bank of Afghanistan governor Khalil Sediq as saying, lies in crypto solutions such as Hyperledger Fabric.This, he claimed, \u201ccould offer a way to access international markets via a first-of-its-kind financial instrument made possible with hyperledger\u2019s blockchain technology financial services platform.\u201dSimilarly buoyant about the concept was newly-installed Tunisian central bank governor Marouane El Abassi. Abassi, known for his progressive stance on technology such as blockchain, said a dedicated working group was already studying the feasibility of a Bitcoin bond. Bitcoin and Hyperledger\u2019s Blockchain technology, he indicated, offers central banks an efficient tool to combat money-laundering, manage remittances, fight cross-border terrorism and limit grey economies.In line with many other nations, Tunisia is also getting to grips with the idea of issuing a digital version of its national fiat currency. IMF Remains CautiousFor Uzbekistan meanwhile, a Bitcoin bond could end up tied to cotton futures, Uzbek Ambassador to the United States Javlon Vakhabov told the Spring Meetings. The approaches may yet gain mixed reviews from the IMF, in particular. Earlier this month, managing director Christine Lagarde again called for caution regarding cryptoassets, saying supervised testing would be preferable as a first step.\u201cOne approach, undertaken in Hong Kong SAR, Abu Dhabi, and elsewhere, is to establish regulatory \u2018sandboxes\u2019 where new financial technologies can be tested in a closely supervised environment,\u201d she concluded in a blog post. Above all, we must keep an open mind about crypto assets and financial technology more broadly, not only because of the risks they pose, but also because of their potential to improve our lives.Lagarde likened the advent of early-stage cryptocurrency and associated financial technology to that of the telephone and its initial reception.

Nonetheless, as Bitcoinist noted, DOGE surged on publication of the tweets, something which the ETH episode appeared to fail at doing.As of press time Tuesday, ETH/USD had traded flat over the past 24 hours, remaining at $157 while Bitcoin (BTC) fell 1.2 percent to $5240.Dogecoin Or Bitcoin Style?Musk\u2019s profile within crypto jumped earlier this year when he faced calls to join the now-completed charity transaction relay to raise funds for Venezuela.Known as Lightning Torch, the relay, which used Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network to \u2018travel\u2019 between holders, saw participation from well-known names including Twitter\u2019s own CEO Jack Dorsey. At the time, Musk refrained from publicly acknowledging the Torch\u2019s presence or giving reasons for that lack of attention. Previous more sincere promotion of Bitcoin had nonetheless made him an obvious choice, the tech mogul having described the largest cryptocurrency as \u201cquite brilliant.\u201dOne theory for Musk\u2019s Ethereum stunt revolves around previous criticism of Twitter\u2019s scambots which constantly offered fake ETH giveaways last year in a notorious phenomenon. At the time, Musk himself appealed to Dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer for help in finding a technical solution to the bots, which impersonated huge numbers of well-known users in an attempt to link them to fraudulent giveaways.\u2018What Should Be Developed On Ethereum?\u2019Thus, when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin invited him to the project\u2019s Devcon event in October, the response was perhaps predictable. \u201cStop giving away free ETH!\u201d Musk replied.A further tweet produced something curiously more serious, with Musk asking Buterin how he envisioned the Ethereum network in the future.\u201cWhat should be developed on Ethereum?\u201d he wrote Tuesday.The latter post swiftly garnered interest from well-known crypto Twitter handles. Blockstream CSO Samson Mow offered \u201celectric rockets\u201d as an option, while trader and commentator WhalePanda used the opportunity to criticize what he viewed as Ethereum\u2019s lack of direction.\u201cThat\u2019s a trick question since its sole purpose was making its founders rich with vague promises of decentralization, scalability and usability\u2026 all which have been broken consistently,\u201d he responded.What do you think about Elon Musk\u2019s Ethereum tweets?

Meanwhile, Fundstrat\u2019s Thomas Lee has said that the cryptocurrency is \u201clikely\u201d to reach new all-time highs \u201caround\u201d 2020. Bitcoin at $6,000: Important Level to WatchHouston-based economic analyst Jesse Colombo, popular for his warning about the U.S. housing and credit bubble back in 2008, has shared his take on the current performance of Bitcoin.According to him, Bitcoin\u2019s performance throughout 2019 has shaken the bears and has started to develop more of a bullish trend.However, in order for the positive trend to be confirmed, the analyst believes that Bitcoin needs to break through the $6,000 resistance level in a \u201cdecisive manner.\u201d Should it manage to do so, it would also increase the probability of further gains.He explains that $6,000 is an important resistance because that\u2019s where Bitcoin found serious support for much of 2018 until November when the cryptocurrency dropped with about 50 percent in a couple of months.Bitcoinist recently reported that Bitcoin\u2019s price consolidation above $5,000 is a positive sign, according to a cryptocurrency hedge fund.On the other hand, however, Colombo has also pointed out that if Bitcoin price 00 fails to close above $6,000, it may fall further back down and re-test the lows in the range between $3,000 and $4,000.Tom Lee Says Bitcoin Price New ATH \u2018Likely\u2019 in 2020On another note, popular bitcoin permabull and chief analyst at Fundstrat Global Advisors, Thomas Lee, has once again called for a major improvement in Bitcoin\u2019s price somewhere \u201caround\u201d 2020, saying that various catalysts are \u201clikely\u201d to drive it to a new all-time high.It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Lee is undoubtedly more cautious with his wording and hasn\u2019t provided a precise target price nor a specific date.However, the analyst has outlined that fundamental and technical factors are improving.I think you\u2019re seeing signs that fundamentals are improving, technicals are improving, and now there\u2019s real activity by, essentially, crypto hodlers.These are just three of the 11 signs that, according to Fundstrat, are characteristic of a bull market, potentially signaling that the crypto winter has come to its end.Additionally, Lee also outlined that Bitcoin\u2019s standard deviation from the S&P 500 which is about 2.5 this year, could also help push the cryptocurrency\u2019s price further.One thing to keep in mind is whenever the S&P has made a big move, \u2026 it\u2019s almost always led to a big move in crypto later in the year. [\u2026] So I think \u2026 a 2.5 standard deviation move for bitcoin would take it to $14,000. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s where it\u2019s going to go, but that\u2019s the magnitude of move that would be a catch-up.What do you think of the current Bitcoin price performance?

According to the announcement, ICE has completed the acquisition of Digital Asset Custody Company (DACC).The move is the latest step by Bakkt to smoothen the process of obtaining approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). So far, the launch of the company\u2019s physically-backed Bitcoin futures contract has faced several delays and postponements.Apart from acquiring DACC, ICE also plans to registered Bakkt as a licensed trust in the state of New York.

There is, however, no word yet on how much ICE paid to acquire the New Jersey-based cryptocurrency custody platform.If approved, Bakkt will become the latest entrant into the expanding field of cryptocurrency custodians. Already, companies like Coinbase and Circle offer custody tools for virtual currencies and Fidelity has its own dedicated digital asset custody service.Bakkt Keen on Addressing CFTC FearsFor Bakkt CEO, Kelly Loeffler, these latest steps do not indicate a change in the company\u2019s approach. Instead, Loeffler opines that they are in line with its original vision plus the need to quickly obtain regulatory green light.Commenting on the matter to Fortune, Loeffler said:There is no pivot. From the ground up what ICE has been building for two years is the safest version of a custody solution for digital assets.As previously reported by Bitcoinist, Bakkt acquired some assets belonging to Rosenthal Collins Group (RCG) back in January 2019. The company also raised more than $180 million from big-name investors like Microsoft, as well as a significant equity deal with Starbucks.Will the acquisition of DACC help get Bakkt over the CFTC approval line?

As we close out the month, we take a look at the BTC/USD charts and what may lie ahead.Bitcoin Price: 1-Month ChartLooking at the monthly chart, Bitcoin price 00 has had a tremendous month, kicking off in the early hours of the second of March, taking Bitcoin from lows of little over $4k to highs of $5627 \u2013 or up around 39% and now some 70% for the year which is in stark contrast to 2018.Despite looking unable to print a high across the $6555 level, from which BTC fell in November 2018, the current move goes a long way to reigniting interest in the market.Bitcoin is on track to close out with the Highest volume for 2019, favoring the bulls and has printed a third consecutive higher low on the mac-d histogram, which is now flattening out and looks like it may be able to avoid crossing below zero which would be considered bearish.50-month moving average also looks as though it is now likely to act as reasonable support should it be tested and now lies at around $3400.4-Hour ChartLooking closer at the 4-hour chart, bitcoin is trading at the upper of the weekly range, around $5200. The MACD is trending to the upside and the histogram is printing higher highs.Despite the uncertainty around Bitfinex and Tether, there seem to be some signs that the bulls want to try to break the weekly highs and finish the month closer to the mid $5000s.At the time of publishing, Bitcoin price has indeed broken to new weekly highs and printed a now higher weekly high up at $5281, which goes some way to suggest that the bulls mean business going into the close weekly close.Open-Short PositionsIt is certainly possible that this is just another chapter in the Bitfinex / Tether saga which eventually works itself out in the end. This is also the opinion of many veteran traders in the market.However, the open-short positions at Bitfinex are now at all-time highs for the year, with large interest rates attached. This will inevitably have life for only so long, with potential upside risk now threatening as the cost of being short increasing across the board.With only a matter of hours remaining, the short term risk appears to be to the upside however there remains the overhanging Tether risk, which will continue to loom over the market as we move into May.Trade Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

Specifically, he envisages an army of 5000 mercenaries \u2013 \u201cPeruvians, Ecuadoreans, Colombians, Spanish speakers\u201d \u2013 helping the opposition to overthrow the incumbent regime.

The country\u2019s fiat currency, a rebranded \u2018Sovereign Bolivar\u2019 (VES) Maduro introduced last year, suffers from inflation that is suggested to reach 8 million percent in 2019. Predictably, Venezuelans have turned to Bitcoin en masse to circumvent capital controls and exposure to capital erosion, transacting more and more bolivars through decentralized platforms each week. For the seven days ending April 27, that number hit almost 36 billion VES, a sign of the extent of inflation as volumes, in fact, dropped lower in Bitcoin terms. Maduro has attempted to divert attention away from uncontrollable decentralized cryptocurrencies, instead of appealing to foreign investors to buy state-issued Petro, a crypto token facing sanctions of its own.The government had already taken a hardline stance regarding citizens\u2019 obligations to shore up Petro, enforcing Petro-only payments for some government services such as new passports. Even before its issuance, critics claimed the new currency had nothing but bad debts backing it, which themselves were many times the size of its market cap.Why do Venezuelan\u2019s prefer Bitcoin?

The figure has drawn ire from cryptocurrency speculators that the world has lost interest in Bitcoin \u2014 but is this really the case?One Twitter use Revin Rooke made the following conclusion:There were 16,710 tweets yesterday, but roughly 30k Bitcoin tweets per day in 2015. The world (outside crypto Twitter) isn\u2019t paying attention to Bitcoin.Although Rooke\u2019s claims have some merit, there is also a ton of evidence to suggest that the world is, in fact, paying close attention to Bitcoin. Number of unique Bitcoin addresses per day Despite the fact that the number of tweets overall has fallen, the number of unique bitcoin addresses has increased parabolically as can be seen from the below graph. The graph notes that at the time of writing this article, the number of unique addresses is 529,636. per day.We see the sharpest changes were around 2017 when bitcoin approached $20,000. Although the number of addresses dropped shortly after, the rate of new addresses maintained their similar trends even after bitcoin dropped to new lows.Google trends Additional evidence of the world\u2019s interest in Bitcoin can be taken from Google trends. In this case, we\u2019re measuring how popular the keyword \u201cbitcoin\u201d is over different time periods. Just like in the case of bitcoin wallet distribution, we can see a sharp increase in interest for the keyword \u201cbitcoin\u201d around 2017 before sharply tapering off. However, what we could also be seeing is that 2017\u2019s peak bought Bitcoin and the blockchain into mainstream awareness. Before the price went parabolic, bitcoin\u2019s search interest had only anemic rallies, but now bitcoin appears to go through its own peak and troughs well ahead of the overheated market of 2017.As Bitcoinist noted earlier, the term \u201cbuy bitcoin\u201d seems to follow, and not lead the price of bitcoin, thus making it a lagging indicator similar to a simple moving average.Local bitcoin volume surges 250% in ThailandAnother factor to Bitcoin\u2019s credit is the surging local volume for local bitcoins in Thailand that increased by 250%.The surge in volume was apparently attributed to a new wave of awareness of Bitcoin in the country, attributed to a \u2018seasteading\u2019 being towed by the Royal Thai Navy.The home was home to a pair of two popular Bitcoin enthusiasts who were popular figures on social media.Mt.Gox Coins Aren\u2019t Moving for a WhileThen there\u2019s the ongoing lawsuit between CoinLabs and Mt Gox that has been covered extensively by Bitcoinist in the past.Although the coins won\u2019t move into circulation until 2020, when they do, we could expect a massive rally as the entity is suspected to hold 141,000 coins.While it is true that the number of tweets of bitcoin has fallen, there are arguably more important metrics to look at before deducing if the world still cares about Bitcoin or not.Google trends, for example, shows Bitcoin to be more popular than \u2018Elon Musk\u2019 and \u2018SpaceX.\u2019The evidence we see from our sources all point to the fact that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and have solidified their positions in mainstream consciousness. Increasing price has shown to spark public increase as well. What do you think of Bitcoin\u2019s interest today?

But what was the first ever recorded price of a single bitcoin? And how much it has appreciated since?Bitcoin Leapfrogs Evolution of MoneyThe evolution of money has historically gone through four key stages. From collectible to a store of value and then to a medium of exchange, and finally a unit of account (such as the US dollar today).What makes Bitcoin unlike any type of money before it is how quickly it became an exchangeable good. Historically, it took eons for people to come to a consensus on a medium of exchange.But then the internet changed everything. However, up until 2009, it still lacked a way to transfer value as it does with information.1/ There are four stages that all market-based monetary goods pass through in their evolution to becoming a fully fledged money:1. Collectible2. Store of Value3. Medium of exchange4. Unit of account pic.twitter.com/2ljSIsNZln\u2014 Vijay Boyapati (@real_vijay) February 28, 2018Bitcoin, being digital, borderless and censorship-resistant, allowed it to leapfrog these evolutionary stages in just a few years. In contrast, it has taken gold thousands of year to transition from a collectible to a medium of exchange and a unit of account (i.e. gold coins).\u201cIt started as a collectible [in January 2009] because Satoshi and Hal Finey had it and they had mined the first couple of blocks,\u201d explains Bitcoin investor, Trace Mayer, in an interview with To the Moon host, Max Keiser. And then Satoshi sent Hal some bitcoin\u2026and within a week someone set up an exchange where you could actually trade bitcoins for dollars. That began to establish an exchange rate ratio.In other words, whereas gold took millennia, bitcoin has jumped \u201cfrom nothing basically to a $65 billion dollar market cap\u201d in just ten years, notes Mayer.Bitcoin Records Its First Ever Spot PriceWithin a year after its official launch, the price of bitcoin was first published by the New Liberty Standard on October 5th, 2009. On this date, one dollar equaled to 1,309.03 BTC. BTC/USD also \u2018crashed\u2019 afterward. Its all-time record low was roughly 1,630 BTC per dollar on December 12, 2009. Though it\u2019s safe to assume that not too many people bought this dip as only a handful even knew bitcoin existed at the time.Today, the price of one bitcoin is around $5,500 USD and with millions of users around the globe. While the inflationary fiat dollar has \u2018crashed\u2019 against bitcoin, down to a minuscule fraction of about 0.00018 BTC today. In other words, the price of bitcoin has appreciated a staggering 720,000,000 percent in just a decade since its first ever recorded price. \u2018It\u2019s Shaken the Planet to Its Core\u2019Yes, even a few bucks in 2009 would have got you thousands of BTC making you a billionaire today.\u201cIf only\u2026\u201dOf course, it was much harder to acquire bitcoin then. Your best bet was to directly get some from the small circle of people first using it, Satoshi Nakamoto included.\u201c\u2026It was very early in the process of bitcoin when it jumped from collectible to exchangeable good,\u201d explains Mayer. \u201cSo the idea of using this protocol as money was there right in the beginning.\u201dThen the technology started spreading, slowly at first, as small online exchanges began to spring up. Unsurprisingly, however, these digital units of scarcity have managed to integrate rather quickly in the era of smartphones and high-speed internet. This has also allowed Bitcoin to mimic the history of gold as a store of value and money but in a much, much shorter timespan. By being digital and easily transferrable over the internet, Bitcoin spread like wildfire. Today, it is processing hundreds of thousands of transactions a day and settling billions of dollars. What\u2019s more, it is doing it in a decentralized way, peer-to-peer while minimizing the need to trust any central authority.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge deal now. It\u2019s shaken the planet to the core,\u201d adds Mayer.Today, even the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, admits Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a whole is a huge deal with disruptive potential. She recently said: I think the role of the disruptors and anything that is using distributed ledger technology, whether you call it crypto, assets, currencies, or whatever \u2026 that is clearly shaking the system. We don\u2019t want innovation that would shake the system so much that we would lose the stability that is needed. Will Bitcoin continue to see astronomical gains over the next decade?

Here\u2019s what he had to say.How did you manage to get 1.5 million people lining up in your waiting list?Well, it\u2019s just a really great product that sells itself! Who doesn\u2019t want commission-free trading? No, seriously, of course, it\u2019s one thing to have a great product, but another to make sure that people hear about it. I won\u2019t lie, we have a really excellent marketing team at Digitex! We started the waitlist campaign back in August, so it has had quite some time to build up such high numbers.We used viral marketing and incentivized users through a waitlist competition. Users had to sign up and get a referral code and then pass that on to their trader friends. The more referrals that they made, the higher they went up in the queue. The top 10 winners each get 10K DGTX and the top 5,000 get 1000 DGTX airdropped into their accounts to trade with. As you can imagine, as the price has been rising, so were the stakes of the competition. 100K DGTX has been worth as much as $16,000 at its highest point.What are the main factors impacting the price of DGTX?Like any cryptocurrency, DGTX is subject to external influences. There\u2019s a lot going on in our ecosystem right now and many factors that can influence the price. We\u2019re less than one week away from the public launch of our commission-free futures exchange, we had quite a lot of interest and buzz over the Paris Blockchain Week Summit last week, where I did an interview with Bad Crypto and contributed to a panel on exchanges and brokers, and just generally spread the word about Digitex.We launched a demo at the end of the last week and the community got a sneak peek at what will be coming at the end of the month. We also launched the Digitex Treasury in March. It\u2019s an ongoing token sale in which we locked 10% of our initial DGTX supply into a smart contract that releases 10 million tokens every three months. When we started on March 1, the price was less than 5 cents, today it\u2019s trading at around double that. The Treasury allows people to help fund the project while getting their tokens in an instant trustless transaction direct from us.We\u2019ve also just got such a large community waiting for our product to come out! Since you need DGTX to trade on the platform, naturally those interested in trading on it will have to buy it, and that increases demand and therefore, price. As you said, we have over 1.5 million on the waitlist and a huge Telegram group of around 70K people. It\u2019s really active too, we have four or five admins manning it 24/7.What makes Digitex unique? How is it different than what\u2019s already out there?It\u2019s a commission-free futures exchange and by the end of quarter three, will also be non-custodial. With just those two factors, you can see how unique the exchange is. Traders don\u2019t have to pay commissions and they don\u2019t have to trust us with their funds.We\u2019re also going to be offering traditional futures markets like Forex, tech stocks, indices, gold, and commodities. This will give crypto traders massive exposure to the trillion-dollar futures industry and the chance to speculate on entirely new markets. It will also give traditional retail traders a bridge to cross over into crypto while trading on the markets that they are familiar with.I think another really key differentiator is that we can really say that we are an exchange whose interests are aligned with its users. Unlike exchanges that trade against its traders and siphon liquidity out of the pool in the form of commission fees, we both want token appreciation.There is no mechanical edge against traders and, by removing the commission fees, we allow short-term, high-frequency traders the chance to actually make a living at what they do best\u2013in a way they can\u2019t on fee-charging exchanges.Can you tell us a bit more about the exchange\u2019s hybrid model and Plasma integration?We are working alongside the Ethereum-approved Matter Inc. developer team to integrate Plasma into the backend. This will allow for decentralized account balances, meaning that Digitex won\u2019t be able to ever tamper with customer funds. It also means that it won\u2019t be a target for hackers and that it is a non-custodial exchange, coming in the third quarter of this year.We are one of the first projects to implement the Plasma Protocol, which was originally described by Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon in their whitepaper. We\u2019re extremely proud to be part of Ethereum\u2019s scaling solution and when they approached us to be one of their first use cases, we jumped at the chance. Our developers have already achieved 25,000 transactions per second, which is 1500x faster than the Ethereum main chain.What are your near-term plans after the platform is launched?We\u2019ve got a ton of plans for the exchange and can\u2019t wait for it to launch. In the very nearest term, we will be onboarding the first users to the exchange on April 30 and announcing the winners of the waitlist contest on May 1. We will be launching with one market (BTC) to start with and then very quickly adding more crypto markets including ETH and LTC and traditional futures markets as well, as I mentioned above.We will be moving from 10x leverage to 100x leverage and then also launching commission-free spot trading around quarter three. This will be really exciting as, by doing this, we will be opening up the exchange to potentially hundreds of thousands (or maybe more!) new traders. This will have an impact on the DGTX price and also on the way that people trade.You see, most people are not used to trading with our one-click ladder interface. Once they start trading with the ladder, they won\u2019t want to go back. It is so much simpler and easier to trade with one mouse click and to visualize the price action going up and down all the time.So, we will be basically expanding the user base and building out our exchange.You recently attended the Paris Blockchain Week Summit, can you tell us about the community feedback you got?The feedback was good! I found that I am getting better at really explaining what we do and how we do it after talking about Digitex so many times! Actually, a lot of the interviews that I did behind the scenes and in the media room are just coming out or haven\u2019t come out yet, so we are excited to see them when they come out, but the response to my on-stage interview was positive and I enjoyed participating in the panel.We\u2019ll be present at a lot more conferences and key events moving forward. It\u2019s always great to meet people who are enthusiastic about the project and have a lot of questions and it\u2019s going to be even better when we have our product launched and can speak in real-world examples.What\u2019s the maximum leverage that your platform will offer?We\u2019ll be starting out with 10x leverage while we onboard the first users to the platform, but soon after that we will be offering 100x leverage.You say the exchange offers zero-fee trading. How\u2019s that possible?The DGTX exchange token is the only way that traders can access our platform. All trades take place in DGTX and all account balances are denominated in DGTX. It\u2019s through this model that we can offer traders a commission-free trading environment.It\u2019s actually quite simple. The more traders that come to our platform for commission-free trading, the greater the demand, and the higher the price of the token. We\u2019ve created a win-win situation for everyone since we\u2019re not siphoning liquidity out of the pool in the form of commission fees.Like I mentioned before, there is no mechanical edge against traders either. Our interests are actually aligned with our users since we want the same thing: the price to go up.While token appreciation is the ultimate goal, this is not how the exchange makes money, we can make money if the token stays the same price because we\u2019re sustainable even if the price doesn\u2019t always go up.We make money from minting a small number of new tokens each year and the inflationary cost of that is offset by demand for the token from traders who must buy it to participate in our liquid, commission-free markets.It\u2019s the community who decides on the inflationary cost. Holding DGTX also allows traders to participate in community votes. To ensure that we can continue to offer commission-free trading in the long term, we propose to mint a small number of tokens starting from 2021."}

With SilkRoad and other black market sites been heavily Bitcoin dependent, the image has not been good. While this has begun to change, and the general public has started to hear more positive reports, things are still touch and go. And the main cause of the loss of consumer confidence in the cryptocurrency is the almost incessant security breaches that plague the industry.A quick summaryBecause Bitcoin is a digital currency, the potential for hacking is extreme. Of course, this is also true of banking institutions that handle digital funds, but it seems more prevalent in cryptocurrencies. In fact, the total for stolen funds in cryptocurrencies crossed $1.3 billion\u2014a massive amount of loss for an industry just ten years old.And, for those who think the direction is positive, and security is improving, statistics show that more than 61% of the losses occurred in 2018. It seems that as values for cryptocurrencies increase, the motivation to steal them increases proportionately.Seeking solutionsThis increase in security failures is due, in large part, to the early stage of adoption of the industry. While banks have had thirty years of digital transactions to improve security, Bitcoin has been around just ten. The nascent technology has left gaps for some to exploit, and exchanges are the biggest culprit.But beyond simply security threats, exchanges are often their own worst enemy. For example, the recent news of the death of the CEO of QuadrigaCX, and the loss of his personally held private keys for investor funds only highlights the need for better and stricter exchange policies.This has led investors to pursue new and more secure exchange options, and particularly those with financial backing. Exchanges that refuse to move toward security and fiscal responsibility will eventually be left on the sideline.Secure and backedOne such example of this new exchange model is FT Exchange or FTX for short. The company has the backing of Alameda Research, responsible for more than $1 billion in trades. With this level of external support, the exchange offers a level of investor security that is rarely available in the cryptocurrency world. Plus, they have created some of the tightest security protocols around.Other exchanges are coming into the market or seeking to enhance their value proposition as well. The main goal is to allow the freedom of financial transacting that has characterized Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, while at the same time protecting investor funds. This sort of \u2018safe/freedom\u2019 model has been tricky to provide but is growing.Of course, as with most assets, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies can be stored offline for maximum security. Simply storing private keys on a hardware or paper wallet will make the coins effectively 100% safe for users. But this defeats the purpose of a cash/payment methodology originally conceived by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.Crushing the marketAs security threats continue, the adoption cycle for Bitcoin has begun to slow. No wonder the euphoria of 2017 turned into the crypto winter of 2018. What seemed a great opportunity for quick returns turned into a security nightmare.And, convincing banks and business owners to offer cryptocurrency support for payments and transfers is an uphill battle. The risks associated with moving into the space are dramatic. And, given the risks, the cost associated with creating the necessary security protocols can be dramatic.Of course, those costs can be offset by market gains and profits. And, the current bull run that Bitcoin is experiencing should provide additional incentive. However, the end game of market adoption won\u2019t be easy to achieve without massive change.Whether Bitcoin and its cryptocurrency cousins eventually grow in adoption remains to be seen. However, the great need in the market is not another low-security exchange startup. Instead, the market must find ways to bring well-funded, secure exchanges online for consumers to use. Without these types of market enhancements adoption will stagnate and the market will be crushed before it reaches maturity.The Rundown A quick summarySeeking solutionsSecure and backedCrushing the market"}

Its value is the number of satoshis (1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshi) that this output will be worth when claimed.Looking at the number of outputs per day, therefore, may serve as a better indicator of overall economic activity since one confirmed transaction can contain many outputs from multiple entities.In other words, the number of total outputs is more indicative of actual economic activity. So only looking at the number of transactions misses an important part of the picture.For example, large players such as exchanges use a process called \u201cbatching.\u201d This essentially combines multiple outputs into one batch or transaction to reduce overall transaction fees.A Better Indicator Presents an Even Better PictureLooking at the outputs per day presents an even more optimistic picture of Bitcoin network activity. It currently stands at 1,067,904 outputs per day, the highest in Bitcoin\u2019s history. This is also about 2.8 outputs per confirmed transaction.Despite today\u2019s price of bitcoin being roughly 70 percent lower than in December 2017, the number of daily outputs is actually about 30 percent higher than during its historic bull-run to $20,000.What\u2019s more, other key network activity indicators such as hash rate is also five time higher than in late 2017.So what does this all mean?For one, Bitcoin is fundamentally a lot stronger and more secure than it was at its price peak.Secondly, it also suggests that real network growth simply could not keep up with the hype and runaway price in 2017.Thirdly, the price \u2018crash\u2019 of 2018 was simply a return to the mean as network fundamentals caught up.Fortunately, the Bitcoin network is in much better shape today displaying healthy growth. It is more secure and more active compared to 2017 as it now settles trillions in value per year. This also doesn\u2019t even include the growing off-chain activity such as that on the Lightning Network.Therefore, while Bitcoin is no stranger to volatility, it\u2019s probably a good bet that Bitcoin can only go up from here.Will bitcoin price eventually catch up to Bitcoin\u2019s fundamentals?

According to bitFlyer, the survey involved seven possible responses to the question \u201cdo you think Bitcoin will still exist in 10 years\u2019 time.\u201dOnly 49 percent of participants said that believed Bitcoin would last the decade. Italy had the highest percentage of Bitcoin believers with 55 percent while France once again occupied the rear with 40 percent.Furthermore, only seven percent of the participants said Bitcoin will exist as a security or investment tool. Commenting on the patterns observed in the result, Andy Bryant, the COO of bitFlyer said:The fact that Bitcoin is not generating as much support as other cryptocurrencies is in part a symptom of the market\u2019s volatility but is also a direct impact of the constant media attention that is associated to its volatility.Poll results aside, Bitcoin continues to outperform the rest of the cryptocurrency market combined. Recent upward gains in April have dampened most of the ground accumulated by altcoins during so-called \u2018altseason.\u2019On the technical side, Bitcoin continues to process greater value transactions that all altcoins combined and even those with lower transaction fees. Security and network effect reign supreme.From Hype to Legitimate Asset ClassOn the whole, the results of bitFlyer\u2019s Euro Poll are in line with the emerging sentiment of cryptocurrencies moving from hype to legitimate asset class. Earlier in April, an IMF Twitter poll showed more than half of responders saying that cryptos will become mainstream within the next five years.Since 2018, there has been a considerable uptick in institutional involvement in the cryptocurrency market. From endowment funds taking investment positions to multinational conglomerates looking to establish vital crypto-based services.The growing consensus among analysts is that the next crypto bull run will emerge on the back of a strengthened asset class as against the hype-driven speculative play that characterized the 2017 bull market.These analysts point to the emergence of a robust Bitcoin market and technical fundamentals, as well as the decline of the ICO market.Do you think Bitcoin will continue to be king of crypto?

It seems that the TD Ameritrade platform was simply testing out the product in demo mode.Even though this bit of news did turn out to be a false start, the race between mainstream exchanges to list cryptoassets will begin shortly.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystDue to local holidays, there will be no daily market update tomorrow or Friday. We will resume on Monday the 29th.Today\u2019s HighlightsS&P500 new ATHVolatility flat through earningsTom & Tuur are BullishPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of April 24th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsThe US stock market marked a new all-time high yesterday as the S&P 500 index flitted past September\u2019s peak. Other indices are still a ways off, but as this is considered to be an index that encompasses the market, many investors are taking note.Market DriversOverall, it seems that volatility has left the markets and investors are no longer very concerned about things like trade wars and Brexit. The VIX volatility index seems to confirm this, showing the lowest reading since October.As earning\u2019s season continues we should get a clearer picture of how the economy really looks. More than 100 companies will report today and tomorrow, including Facebook and Amazon. Check out the full list here.Crypto AnalystsCrypto is seeing a bit of a dip this morning, but I suppose that can be expected after yesterday\u2019s gains. Bitcoin seems to be a bit more stable than the altcoins as it seems the market is consolidating into the leader.We can now say definitively that altseason has come to an end and bitcoin is the market driver once again. For those of you keeping score, altseason lasted precisely 51 days from February 10th until April 2nd. It wasn\u2019t a very long altseason but as nobody was sure how long it would last, I suppose that makes sense.Here\u2019s a graph of the overall market cap and reported (allegedly fake) volumes across global crypto exchanges during that time.As we stated yesterday, it seems everyone is getting bullish on bitcoin again but many still believe that we\u2019re officially in a bear market. One analyst who seems to always be bullish is Fundstraat\u2019s Tom Lee, my new friend on Twitter.In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, he laid out some of the indicators he\u2019s looking at and why the might spell out the start of a new bull market.In short, Fundstraat has its own index called the Bitcoin Misery Index, which tracks how euphoric investors are from 1 to 100. The latest reading of the index was 89, which is the highest reading since the start of the last bull run.Of course, I\u2019m not going to leave you over a long weekend without some great reading material.This report is from one of the most well-respected analysts in the cryptosphere and it\u2019s called Bitcoin in Heavy Accumulation.Enjoy!!

There are a few important things to consider, so let\u2019s dive right into it.Right off the bat, the very first thing to account for is your very own trading style and needs. Naturally, this would depend on your level of advancement: whether you are a beginner or an experienced trader. In the former scenario it\u2019s more about having the necessary resources, while in the latter, it\u2019s more about having all the suitable tools as well as technology infrastructure cut for the needs of the advanced trader.Choosing the right broker would also depend on how active you are. Even more so, it would depend on your investment style and strategy. Certain brokers have set limits such as minimum deposit amount and account minimums. These tend to be geared for a larger investor rather than small-scale retail participants.Other brokers aren\u2019t appropriate for less active traders or those who are looking to invest for the longer term. This is predicated on inactivity fees, annual fees, and trading platform fees. While these expenses might not seem like much at the start, they can quickly stack up to a lot of money over time.Rule #1: Always Check FeesAs a general rule of thumb, you should avoid brokers with high commissions. Always seek those who are providing reasonable fees. This is done fairly easily \u2013 you can always research online and find out the broker\u2019s fee policy.Keep in mind that there are brokers who would charge hidden commissions. That\u2019s why proper, in-depth research is so important. You can find out which brokers to avoid by checking online reviews and scouting for negative user reports. This will help you identify the venues who tend to impose unethical practices.When you\u2019re looking at a selected broker, you should try to see the bigger picture. Evolve.Markets, for example, boasts a powerful trading infrastructure but also provides important instruments such as negative balance protection, geared at limiting the losses a trader can incur. Moreover, the platform understands the importance of timing and provides fast and easy account creation as well as timely funds deposit after only 1 confirmation.Rule #2: Security and TransparencyIn the space of cryptocurrencies, security is of paramount importance. It should always come in the first place. You should aim to settle for a broker which provides reliable infrastructure, as well as advanced safety measures.Perhaps adding to this point is transparency. A good broker shouldn\u2019t only settle for transparent fee policy, but also for a properly devised order book, displaying real market prices and volumes, narrow spreads, appropriate liquidity, and other factors which provide for seamless trading experiences.Rule #3: AccessThe cryptocurrency market is particularly intensive on its own. However, it\u2019s not the only market out there and it\u2019s important to remember there are trading opportunities on other markets, especially during shorter or longer crypto downtrends.Evolve.Markets is a crypto-first trading platform providing high leverage trading on a broad variety of cryptocurrency trading pairs. However, it also gives its users access to trading on traditional markets such as Forex, commodities, and indices. Diversification is important and having the option to navigate through a variety of markets is always beneficial.Rule #4: SupportRegardless of how advanced your broker might be, there will always come a time when you\u2019ll need some additional customer support.An essential consideration for choosing the best broker is to make sure that the customer support responds quickly and that it provides help when you need it. Positive trading experience is largely predicated on quick solving of underlying issues, as well as flawless customer service.What are the things you are looking for when choosing your broker?

He was speaking during a live statement on messaging platform Periscope, following a common trend of issuing directives and policy updates via live media appearances.On this occasion, Maduro issued a plea to anyone willing to part with hard currency in exchange for Petro cryptocurrency, one of the remaining means by which the long-sanctioned regime is able to finance its operations.\u201cWe welcome all those who will invest in finance and banking sectors, and in the cryptocurrency Petro,\u201d he said. As Bitcoinist reported, Petro received a highly sceptical reception when it debuted in 2018. Notionally backed by oil reserves, investigations quickly found its principal supporter \u2013 state-backed oil company \u2013 had debts multiple times higher than Petro\u2019s total market cap. Many international governments also steered clear, with the U.S. being among the first to legally stop its citizens interacting with Petro. The backlash failed to stop Maduro\u2019s publicity efforts, however, with reports claiming representatives had approached various cryptocurrency exchanges in a bid to gain liquidity for the token. Bitcoin Is Venezuela\u2019s Preferred CryptocurrencyAt the same time, Venezuelans themselves have notably voted with their wallets on Petro, instead opting overwhelmingly to purchase Bitcoin. On an almost weekly basis, the country transacts more and more of the largest cryptocurrency, citizens attempting to preserve their wealth in the face of inflation which will likely hit 8 million percent in 2019. As P2P trading platform Localbitcoins sees records shattered, dedicated aid ventures from the cryptocurrency sphere also continue.This week, charity scheme Airdrop Venezuela announced it had raised just over $270,000 in donations for a total of 60,000 beneficiaries. Steve Hanke, the John Hopkins University professor leading the campaign, revealed the figures during an interview with radio station NPR.\u201cThis will be a demonstration of how relief agencies all around the world can easily deliver aid and relief to people in need,\u201d he said in light of the previous refusal of the Maduro regime to allow aid from Colombia. You won\u2019t have to drive a pickup truck around filled with cash that you\u2019re giving away or filled with medicine or clothing or food. That\u2019s an inefficient and unsafe way to do things. You\u2019ll have a very safe way to do it. I think it will be the \u2013 a \u2013 really, a new thing.Elsewhere, the Lightning Network\u2019s Lightning Torch event, which has now completed, raised 0.41 BTC ($2220) for Venezuela.What do you think about Venezuela\u2019s call to buy Petro?

It holds the lion\u2019s share of the attention of investors and critics alike.Whether positive or negative news, stories relating to Bitcoin tend to dominate the \u201cCryptocurrency Twitterverse.\u201dCase in point, the hashtag #Bitcoin had more than 800 tweets within the hour as at the time of writing this article.Of the top 15 cryptos listed in the index, the top three mirror the positions of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP occupy the first, second, and third position, respectively.Don\u2019t Believe The HypeHowever, the perceived hype isn\u2019t everything. Especially on Twitter, a platform rife with phony accounts operated for certain agendas. Twitter bots don\u2019t only push fraudulent investment schemes but can also be used to prop up cryptocurrency projects.For example, the report highlights how proponents of Ripple and XRP \u2013 the \u201cXRP Army,\u201d use Twitter to put the company and the token in the spotlight of crypto discourse.At least 8,000 outright fake XRP-related accounts were identified by analyst Geoff Goldberg. DataLight notes:He highlights how a set of accounts creates content which is replicated by a network of other accounts, generating more retweets and likes and so registers a ripple effect (no pun intended) of false enthusiasm for XRP. Furthermore, he identifies a trend where apparent bots follow each other, using XRP or Ripple-based hashtags in their bios to make use of algorithms that disseminate the message.astroturfing = the deceptive tactic of simulating grassroots support for a product, cause, etc., undertaken by people or organizations with an interest in shaping public opinion #xrparmy #xrpthestandard #xrpcommmunity #xrpthebase #xrp cc: @yoyoel @vijaya @JoelKatz @CoryTV pic.twitter.com/H3s9PfuiwM\u2014 geoff golberg (@geoffgolberg) December 4, 2018Twitter Hype and Herd MentalityAt the same time, Twitter hype can play a significant role in gauging investor sentiment, which is a fundamental analysis tool for investors. This position relies on the assumption that Twitter constitutes a fair representation of the collective mood of investors. An excerpt from the report reads:Other than inferring general bullish or bearish trends, the Hype Index can help an investor more specifically. If for example, surging prices are not accompanied by positive movements on the Hype Index, investors might be wary of buying in. While a rising Twitter Hype Index that is not accompanied by a rising price could help investors identify undervalued cryptoassets.As previously reported by Bitcoinist, herd mentality remains a significant influencer of investor sentiment. With retail investors dominating the cryptocurrency market, there are bound to be sharp reactions to market trends usually signaled by social media commentary.Meanwhile, Google data shows that the public interest in Bitcoin lags behind price moves suggesting that we are still not out of the early speculative stages of tech adoption.Do you think social media hype plays a significant part in shaping the market sentiment for cryptocurrencies?

At the same time, USDT production stepped up in April to almost reach its highest-ever level of $2.83 billion April 25. As Bitcoin entrepreneur Alistair Milne noted on social media Thursday, the last time more than $2.8 billion worth of USDT tokens was in circulation was October 2018, at which time BTC price held at around $6250.Tether production and reduction have traditionally impacted on Bitcoin price performance. As Bitcoinist previously reported, sudden \u2018printing\u2019 of USDT induces volatility in Bitcoin markets. Since April 8, the USDT supply has increased by more than one third from its previous level of $2.08 billion.Overall this month, BTC/USD 00 has jumped by a broadly similar amount \u2013 at press time, 32 percent since April 1.Sending Bitcoin Back Over $6kTether has frequently come in for criticism over its printing activities, pressure increasing in recent months after officials appeared to quietly remove promises that all tokens were backed by US dollars. Having billed itself as the opposite of fractional reserve banking, the new descriptions of USDT being supported by unspecified \u201creserves\u201d drew predictably undesirable comparisons. Nonetheless, the potential room for growth compounds already strong sentiment among commentators that Bitcoin price can only go up, not down, from current levels.As Bitcoinist reported earlier this week, some of the industry\u2019s best-known names have attributed high probabilities to the concept that the price of bitcoin has definitively bottomed.Specifically, that \u2018bottom\u2019 came in December last year, when upheaval among developers of altcoin Bitcoin Cash caused BTC/USD to drop by almost half to $3100. Going that low again, analyst Willy Woo concluded this week, is just 5 percent likely.Not Out of the Woods Yet, But\u2026Buoying the bulls are factors centered on technical and adoption signs. Bitcoin economic activity, Bitcoinist noted this week, is around 30 percent higher than during the cryptocurrency\u2019s all-time highs of $20,000 in December 2017. Despite its lengthy bear market the following year, Bitcoin is nonetheless recovering strongly within the context of those highs. The behavior sets Bitcoin further and further apart from altcoins, which have overwhelmingly lost more versus their best-ever price and broadly failed to recoup the losses in the interim.Ethereum (ETH) is currently down 88 percent against Bitcoin\u2019s 72 percent, while third-largest asset by market cap Ripple (XRP) is still down 90 percent.What do you think about Tether supply versus Bitcoin price?

If you submit things just for the purpose of submitting things, it will tie up the trademark system unnecessarily. Nike does not have a history of filings that are speculative.Reportedly, the attorney has also said that there\u2019s a 30-day period to appeal the application. If approved, however, Nike would have reserved the \u201cCryptokicks\u201d name for a period of four years, during which it would need to launch a commercial product with that name.Gerben added:There\u2019s a requirement that you commercially use a trademark to get the rights to it.Shoes On The Blockchain?At this point, it\u2019s questionable how Nike intends to use the cryptocurrency and what its purpose would be. However, looking at the items that seek protection, we can see that the company has more than once stressed on the fact that the cryptocurrency will be put up for use \u201cby members of an online community.\u201dThis could mean that Nike intends to use the Cryptokicks cryptocurrency as part of some closed community incentive program.Interestingly enough, earlier this year, Nike also unveiled its self-lacing HyperAdapt trainers model, which is also rechargeable. Perhaps the patent hints at some sort of incentive system for people wearing these trainers. The cryptocurrency could serve as some kind of rewards mechanism, though it\u2019s too early to tell. One can also easily see how a cryptocurrency wallet fits in that plan as well.Besides launching its own cryptocurrency, Nike also intends to create a lot of associated products and services. In one of the sections, we come across the following:Online marketplace services, namely, providing a marketplace for buyers and sellers of digital currency assets; Operating an online marketplace featuring footwear and clothing; on-line retail store services.The company also intends to create cryptocurrency software and hardware wallets, mobile apps for \u201cproviding access to crypto-collectibles, crypto-art, and application tokens,\u201d and so forth.What do you think Nike will do with the Cryptokicks trademark?

Bitfinex\u2019s parent company iFinex is currently in the midst of grappling with funds it gave to a third-party payment processor in 2018.Ostensibly to handle Bitfinex withdrawal requests, the processor, Crypto Capital Corp., failed to distribute the funds, which iFinex maintains are not stolen or otherwise quarantined.Nonetheless, iFinex subsequently used USD reserves backing its stablecoin Tether (USDT) 00 to plug the gap, something which New York\u2019s Attorney General now says drained those reserves by around $700 million. This week, the Attorney General demanded that practice cease, leading to the assumption that iFinex was now using other sources of funds. Though no criminal charges are being sought at this time.The news appeared to spark a chain withdrawal surge on Bitfinex, with major investors holding coins on the exchange signalling they had abandoned it. The giant transactions from the platform\u2019s cold wallet could thus theoretically suggest the exchange is balancing the books in the wake of client withdrawals.Bitfinex And Tether \u2018Financially Strong\u2019As Bitcoinist reported, Bitfinex subsequently issued a blog post denouncing the Attorney General\u2019s attempt to force its hand over the Crypto Capital affair.\u201c\u2026We have been informed that these Crypto Capital amounts are not lost but have been, in fact, seized and safeguarded,\u201d officials wrote. We are and have been actively working to exercise our rights and remedies and get those funds released.

The Bitcoin price in October circled $6250, leading some to consider the cryptocurrency has room for improvement over current levels.\u201cAnd both Bitfinex and Tether are committed to fighting this gross overreach by the New York Attorney General\u2019s office against companies that are good corporate citizens and strong supporters of law enforcement,\u201d Bitfinex concluded.What do you think about the Bitfinex withdrawals?

Meanwhile, reports have emerged that the government is looking to ban cryptocurrencies entirely.RBI Bent on Stifling Bitcoin Growth in IndiaSpeaking to BusinessLine, Nischal Shetty, CEO of WazirX \u2013 an Indian peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto exchange, said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was being unfair to cryptocurrency businesses.According to Shetty:A sandbox would have helped Indian entrepreneurs participate more freely in building blockchain-based applications.The WazirX CEO berated the RBI for being obtuse about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Earlier in April, the RBI released its draft proposal for a fintech regulatory sandbox excluding cryptocurrencies but made provisions for blockchain-based startups.Shetty opined that the RBI is apparently under the false impression that blockchain is the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies.Such reasoning is akin to saying exhaust fumes are the underlying technology behind automobiles or as Shetty puts it:Without crypto, public blockchain projects cannot be built. So, this sandbox is practically useless for all public blockchain projects.Other critics like angel investor Sanjay Mehta believe the RBI is going about Bitcoin regulation the wrong way. Instead of banning Bitcoin-related activity, Mehta says the RBI should be encouraging crypto startups to pursue licensing and registration for their businesses.A few cryptocurrency exchanges have already shut down operations in the country. Banks have even reportedly closed the accounts of customers involved in Bitcoin trading.Blanket Bitcoin Ban ImminentIn a related development, reports indicate that the country\u2019s government is looking to enact a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies.According to The Economic Times (ET), inside sources at the government say there is already a bill under consideration among several government departments.The bill titled \u201cBanning of Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies\u201d could spell the end of cryptocurrency business in the country \u2013 and force it underground.Reports suggest that several government agencies have already backed the idea of a blanket ban on crypto.The ban will reportedly cover trading, sale, and issuance of all forms of virtual currencies. However, with elections due in May 2019, progress on the matter might be delayed.ET notes that several government agencies say cryptocurrency forms a conduit for the movement of dirty money. Thus, an interim order is being considered that would see business activity involving Bitcoin and other cryptos banned under the country\u2019s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Earlier in the year, some lawmakers in the country revealed that the government\u2019s apathy towards Bitcoin stemmed from fears of cryptocurrencies destabilizing rupee monopoly.Do you think a blanket ban by India would have even less of an effect on the market that China\u2019s?

Gox\u2019s trustee in charge of the rehabilitation process says the new submission deadline is now October 28, 2019. The previous cut-off point was scheduled for Friday this week, but Kobayashi acknowledged that the volume and complexity of user claims meant such a timeframe was insufficient.\u201cA large amount of rehabilitation claims that the Rehabilitation Trustee fully or partially disapproved remains undetermined for being subject to claim assessment procedures,\u201d the statement reads. Accordingly, it is not possible at this moment to make appropriate provisions in a rehabilitation plan on modifications of the rights of the rehabilitation claims, repayment methods, and appropriate measures for the undetermined rehabilitation claims and therefore to submit a rehabilitation plan by April 26, 2019.Coinlab, Karpeles And More HeadachesThe saga of reuniting Mt. Gox investors with funds lost in the exchange\u2019s 2014 hack has become a five-year ordeal.As Bitcoinist reported, slow legal proceedings combined with attempts to hijack the payout process by certain creditors have caused multiple delays to dividing up the surviving stash of 141,000 Bitcoin ($726 million) and 142,000 Bitcoin Cash ($37.4 million).Earlier this month, the head of Mt. Gox Legal, an organized group of those awaiting payouts, quit his advocacy role after complaining the legal fall-out of unforeseen challenges could last years more.In particular, Andy Pag complained about an ownership bid by Coinlab, which previously claimed it is owed $16 billion \u2013 an amount which would dwarf others\u2019 entitlement to funds. Even if the company fails to sue for that amount, which began as a claim for just $75 million, a lesser claim would still cause the same inevitable effect, Pag says.\u201cIf [Coinlab] were to go to litigation, they would probably choose a litigation\u2026 claim value that was affordable in terms of litigation fee but big enough that it still holds the process up,\u201d he told Peter McCormack\u2019s What Bitcoin Did podcast April 15. Mt. Gox has slowly faded from public consciousness since Kobayashi halted sales of Bitcoin on the open market last year. As Bitcoinist noted at the time, the huge exchange-based trades accompanied notable periods of Bitcoin price volatility, which gained Kobayashi considerable criticism.

Lawyers continue to query whether any wrongdoing ever took place.According to events which have now come to light, members of an FSB bureau in Moscow, charged with investigating IT-related crimes, ended up using a pseudonym to threaten Galimov\u2019s family. In return for Galimov\u2019s freedom and their safety, they said, the family would have to transfer ransom money exclusively in Bitcoin to an arranged recipient.One of the two figures in charge of the operation, an agent by the name of Kolbov, orchestrated the bribe under the name Mikhail, also telling Gamilov\u2019s son he should leave Russia to avoid \u201cdoing time for his father.\u201dIn the event, several instalments of the bribe reached Kolbov and fellow perpetrator, agent Sergey Belorusov, as part of a sting operation.A Moscow court is now determining the fate of the agents, while Galimov will nonetheless still have to protest his innocence as his own legal battle continues.Bitcoin, Regulation And Government ImpotenceThe embarrassment adds further fuel to the fire regarding Russia\u2019s increasingly erratic attempts to control cryptocurrency use.As Bitcoinist reported Friday, lawmakers appear unable to get to grips with the nature of decentralized networks, reflected in their latest plans to impose investment limits on Bitcoin and altcoins.Russia has long sought to introduce hard-and-fast regulation of crypto, the expectation being that new laws will come into effect in Q4 this year. The language of the bills, critics say, nonetheless remains overly broad and fails to describe the nature of the phenomenon adequately.Earlier in April, Bitcoinist also noted a surprising claim by a Kremlin economist that the Russian government has been covertly amassing Bitcoin worth $8.6 billion. Last week, meanwhile, the same economist ridiculed plans by Russia and China to launch a gold-backed cryptocurrency, saying it would be automatically inferior to Bitcoin.What do you think about the Russian police bribe scandal?

The Bitcoin infrastructure developer says the news marks a watershed moment in the actualization of decentralized trading and settlement infrastructure for BTC derivatives.Details of the TransactionIn a blog post published by Blockstream on Friday (April 19, 2019), the company said it successfully carried out a peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin forward contract with Crypto Garage.Forward contracts (forwards) are private agreements between two entities \u2013 buyer and seller, that allows the purchase and sale of an asset based on an agreed-upon future set price. Unlike futures contracts, forwards do not require a third-party intermediary.Both parties began the trade on Tuesday (April 9, 2019) with each participant declaring collateral of 0.16 BTC each. Based on the terms of the contract, which stipulated settlement within the hour after midnight on April 16, both parties concluded the contract at a price of $5,032.The test BTC forward contract used the price displayed on the ICE Cryptocurrency Data Feed. Blockstream says it earned about $230 on its bet to go short on BTC.P2P Bitcoin Derivatives TradingFor Blockstream the success of this transaction indicates the possibility of creating a platform for \u2018trustless\u2019 BTC derivates trading. Presently, Bitcoin futures trading occurs on centralized platforms like BitMEX and the CME.Blockstream argues that the partial-collateralization of futures contracts opens is a double-edged sword that opens up the possibility of huge losses.Back in 2018, Bitcoinist reported on OKEx having to perform a $9 million clawback to cover losses from an over-leveraged $416 million BTC futures bet that went wrong.Instead, Blockstream argues that the trustless nature of Bitcoin forwards will eliminate any counterparty risks. All each party has to do is post their maximum profit and loss exposure with the trusted price oracle doing the rest.However, some online commentators have criticized the \u2018trustless\u2019 label put on the product by Blockstream. This is because bitcoin forwards are actually based on the use of a \u201ctrusted price feed.\u201dBlockstream nonchalantly slapping the word \"trustless\" on completely trust-dependent things is probably one of the most surefire strategies to seem like a total scam-company I can think of.congratsyouplayedyourself.gif https://t.co/b0bB1FTww1\u2014 Eric Wall (@ercwl) April 19, 2019Possible Future Liquid Bitcoin ImplementationAccording to the blog post, the BTC forwards contract settlement took place on the Bitcoin blockchain.

However, it\u2019s certainly piquing interest again and is more popular than Elon Musk and SpaceX combined, according to Google. But as the majority of the community has demonstrated time and again, they don\u2019t want to spend their bitcoin on everyday items.Arnhem in the Netherlands was labeled the world\u2019s most bitcoin-friendly city, accepting bitcoin payments for anything from Dutch open sandwiches to sporting equipment. But after the first wave of hype died down, the people who spent there felt rather foolish. After all, buying a T-shirt for $20 worth of BTC on one day is no great shakes.

However, it\u2019s quite unusual outside of Asia to see them start out accepting BNB. CZ\u2019s formidable creation is like one giant octopus with tentacles everywhere (with the notable exception of the United States\u2013for now).Last month, Binance broke into the Australian market officially launching Binance Lite. It may sound like a low-calorie beverage, but Binance Lite allows people to buy bitcoin through newsagents across the country (should they be so inclined).Since TravelbyBit has worked so closely with Binance, they say, they included BNB payments at Origin Kebabs. The article enthuses:With Binance Lite, you can easily trade cash for bitcoin, then spend right away at Origin Kebabs.Awesome. But the question remains\u2026 Why would anyone want to go through that hassle when they could just spend $10 on a kebab? No extra steps and no buyer\u2019s remorse when BTC breaks into bullish terrain again.It\u2019s great that you can now buy falafel and breakfast kebabs with BNB, LTC, ETH, and BTC.

Reports indicate that the company\u2019s value plunged by about 90 percent from an initial valuation of $25 million, all in the space of one year.Huatie HengAn originally a construction company reportedly purchased 36,500 units of hardware listed as \u201cservers\u201d from Canaan and Ebang in 2018.Given that both companies don\u2019t sell servers but instead sell crypto mining hardware, the suspicion is that Huatie HengAn pivoted from construction to cryptocurrency mining.Back in December 2018, Huatie\u2019s end-of-year financial report showed losses of about $14 million for its subsidiary firm. By February 2018, the total net loss had risen to $23 million.With the total loss just $2 million off from its initial $25 million investment into the business, it appears the parent company decided to count its losses and sell the business.Chinese Listed Company Lost over $23 Million for Its Secret #Crypto Mining Business | https://t.co/z0jfNUUekk #GMO #Bitmain #Canaan #Ebang https://t.co/lA9P3YyKC5\u2014 8BTCnews (@btcinchina) April 19, 2019If Huatie HengAn was indeed engaging in cryptocurrency mining, it would be the latest in a growing list of businesses affected by the 2018 bear market.During the year-long bear period, the entire cryptocurrency market fell by an average of more than 80 percent across the board.2018 \u2013 A Dreadful Year for Mining CompaniesFor the first half of 2018, it appeared as though mining companies were immune to the hemorrhaging prices in the cryptocurrency market. However, by Q3 2018 reports of difficult financial situations began to emerge.Cloud mining services like Hashflare were the first to shut down citing lack of profitability. Then reports began to emerge of massive losses for mining giant Bitmain \u2013 a situation further worsened by a bet on Bitcoin Cash that ultimately backfired.The fallout from the suspected losses has seen the company downsize its workforce, firing entire departments. Bitmain has also appointed a new CEO.Ebang, Bitmain, and Canaan abandoned plans for massive initial public offerings (IPO). GMO also incurred losses of $12 million forcing the company to shut down its mining hardware enterprise.Even companies like Nvidia that sold hardware for miners weren\u2019t left out as the company is reportedly trying to offload unsold inventory as demand shrunk in 2018.Do you think Huatie HengAn was secretly mining cryptocurrencies under the guise of could computing?

We should let investors, companies, and individuals know what the landscape and treatment will be moving forward to support innovation and development. The blockchain has vast potential.As Bitcoinist has often noted, the US currently operates a patchwork approach to crypto regulation which varies from one state to another. The implications of the policy have been significant, with businesses complaining of impossible barriers to entry and many entities barring US users from their services. Yang agrees, saying that the absence of a standardized national policy will only end up to the country\u2019s disadvantage. \u201c\u2026[S]tates have come up with a patchwork of varying regulations that make it difficult for the US cryptocurrency markets to compete with those in other jurisdictions, especially China and Europe,\u201d his statement continues.\u2026It\u2019s time for the federal government to create clear guidelines as to how cryptocurrencies/digital asset markets will be treated and regulated so that investment can proceed with all relevant information.Get Rid Of \u2018Onerous\u2019 BitLicenseSpecific scorn came in for New York\u2019s BitLicense, which Yang describes as \u201conerous.\u201d The notoriously inefficient scheme has frequently come in for public scrutiny from users and businesses alike, all of whom complain that it fails comprehensively in its objectives to formalize the industry.Instead of relying on legacy lawmakers\u2019 perspective, Yang pledges to use efforts already underway to give crypto breathing space in the US as the basis for his entire policy.Specifically, he would \u201cwork with the sponsors of the Token Taxonomy Act and Wyoming legislators to promote\u201d favorable conditions, these being \u201clargely modeled after their work.\u201dThe complex regulation-sharing status quo between two US regulators \u2013 the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) \u2013 would also come under review.

Up more than 315 percent since January 1. BNB has managed to surpass its former all-time high values from January 12th, 2018.The First to Breach Former USD ATH As Bitcoinist reported earlier this week, Binance Coin is one of the top performing cryptocurrencies, having a breakout year against Bitcoin.BNB 00 continues its surge not only against BTC, but also against the US dollar. The cryptocurrency managed to become the first one to soar past its former ATH value against the USD which was achieved back in January 2018 \u2013 right around the peak of 2017\u2019s historic bull-run. Back then, BNB was trading at $24.46.Against BTC, Binance Coin is also doing splendidly, again surging to another ATH.At the time of this writing, BNB is up around 13 percent in the last 24 hours alone.Reasons For BNB\u2019s SurgeIt\u2019s safe to say that there is more than just one reason for BNB\u2019s strong performance throughout 2019. So let\u2019s take a look at a few of them.UtilityBinance Coin\u2019s main purpose was to allow traders to receive significant discounts on trading fees when using BNB to pay for them.According to the official whitepaper, those who use BNB to pay their fees will receive a 50 percent discount in the first year, 25 percent in the second year, 12.5 percent in the 3rd year, and 6.75 percent in the fourth year. This applies to exchange fees, withdraw fees, listing fees, and any other fees on Binance.BNB BurningThe initial supply of BNB was set to 200 million. However, the Malta-based exchange has said that it will be destroying the BNB equivalent of 20 percent of their quarterly profits until 50 percent of all coins are burned, leaving just 100 million BNB in circulation.So far, there have been 7 quarterly burns, which have removed a total of 10,677,344 BNB from circulation.Initial Exchange OfferingsBinance was also the first cryptocurrency exchange to begin conducting initial exchange offerings (IEOs). Essentially, these are fundraising events where the exchange is selecting a certain project, issuing tokens through a dedicated platform and listing them immediately for trade once the IEO has finished.The catch, however, is that you can only use the exchange\u2019s native token to participate. Hence, those who wish to buy in an IEOs conducted by Binance would have to first buy BNB. Even more so, Binance has implemented a new rule which requires those who wish to participate to hold BNB for a minimum of 20 days prior to the event.So far, Binance Launchpad has completed four IEOs, each one of which has ended in a few seconds with thousands of people lining up to take part.Binance ChainAnother major development around Binance has been the recent launch of its mainnet for the decentralized exchange Binance Chain.It created a serious hype in the cryptocurrency community, especially as every crypto that\u2019s migrating to Binance Chain is pumping in price.Changpeng ZhaoCommunity sentiment surely plays a role in the price of cryptocurrencies and it\u2019s safe to say that the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, is amongst the most prominent individuals out there.Not only is he constantly outlining the achievements of Binance, as well as those of other projects which attribute to the overall adoption of cryptocurrencies, he also manages to appeal to many in the space. This became even more so after he came through with his promise that Binance would delist Bitcoin SV following the ongoing feud between Craig Wright and certain members of the community.The above are just some of the reasons for the strong performance of BNB. However, with the Binance Chain token swap incoming in a few days, it\u2019s interesting to see whether BNB will maintain its steady course upwards.Is BNB leading the next market bull-run?

Since then, Brazil\u2019s inflation rate has shown an upward trend. The Rios Times writes,\u201cThe latest result of the IPCA was the highest for the month of March since 2015. The IPCA, which measures the country\u2019s official inflation, rose by 0.43 percent in February, and 0.09 percent in March of last year.\u201dAs a result, the Brazilian Statistics and Geography Institute (IBGE) reports that the cumulated inflation rate for the last 12 months reached 4.58 percent.Economic Woes Correlated With Rising Bitcoin ActivityA few days before the announcement of the inflation upsurge, coincidentally, Cointrader Monitor, a monitoring tool that analyzes Bitcoin price movements in the country, tweeted that Brazilian cryptocurrency exchanges traded more than 100,000 BTC on April 10, 2019.Meanwhile, the Real has seen some of the biggest fiat inflows into bitcoin comprising $315 million over the past 24 hours, according to data from Coinlib. Neighboring Argentina Catching Bitcoin FeverThe sustained rise in the general price level of goods and services, combined with other economic woes, is not only afflicting Brazil but also Argentina.Argentina is the second largest economy in Latin America, behind its neighbor Brazil.Many have proposed that economic problems are causing the rise of Bitcoin trading volumes to increase dramatically. For example, The Rio Times wrote,A slump in the economy is likely the reason for the rise of cryptocurrencies in Brazil.In Argentina, the economic situation is much grimmer. Argentina\u2019s central bank has been forced to tighten monetary policy three times in the last month. Nevertheless, inflation is still accelerating at a rate of nearly 55 percent. Bloomberg writes:The inflation rate rose to almost 55 percent in March, with consumer prices rising 4.7 percent in the month, exceeding all of the forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.For the last several weeks, investors in Argentina have also been turning their focus to the cryptocurrency, as data released by LocalBitcoins shows.Similarly, trading volume on peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitcoins has also been surging across in Mexico, following US President Donald Trump\u2019s threat of clamping down on remittances by illegal immigrants.In such economic situations, the cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly attractive mainly because Bitcoin, among other attributes, is inherently borderless and inflation-resistant \u2014 as only 21 million digital coins will ever be created, by the year 2140.Do you think Brazil\u2019s inflationary trend contributes to its recent upswing in Bitcoin trading activity?

Coinnest had already terminated account creation features as early as Tuesday (April 16, 2019).Following the decision to shut down, the platform says it will stop trading and deposit services at the end of April 2019. Customers will have until the last day of June 2019 to withdraw crypto held in the company\u2019s wallets.Coinnest also announced a lowering of withdrawal fees, as well as the minimum withdrawal amount to enable the process to go on smoothly. The platform warned users that it will not process any withdrawals after June 30, 2019.This news of the Coinnest shutdown rounds up what has most likely been a miserable year for the beleaguered exchange. Back in April 2018, Bitcoinist reported the arrest of the company\u2019s CEO for fraud and embezzlement.Kim Ik-hwan, the arrested CEO was subsequently found guilty and sent to prison with a $2.5 million fine. At the start of the year, an airdrop went bad also cost Coinnest about $5 million further worsening the company\u2019s liquidity problems.South Korean Exchanges Report Significant LossesThe Coinnest shutdown comes closely on the heels of reports that three of the \u201cbig four\u201d South Korean Bitcoin exchanges recorded losses in 2018. The prolonged bear market of 2018 which saw cryptocurrency plummet massively caused significant dents in the revenue earned by these platforms.According to Business Korea, only Upbit earned profits for 2018 with Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit all reporting net losses. Upbit spent some portion of 2018 under scrutiny from regulators and law enforcement in South Korea with the company eventually forced to reduce the number of tokens traded on its platform.This decision perhaps helped shield Upbit from the negative impact of the bear market. Upbit reported a profit of more than $87 million.Bithumb, on the other hand, incurred a net loss greater than that reported by Coinone and Korbit combined. Financial results published by the BTCKorea.com, operators of the platform, Bithumb suffered a net loss of $180.65 million.End-of-year financials for both Coinone and Korbit show losses of $5 million and $40 million respectively.Do you think other exchange platforms will close down following the difficulties experienced in 2018?

It\u2019s nauseating watching sh*tcoin after sh*tcoin distract fleeting investors, but the data doesn\u2019t lie. Let\u2019s look at the top five performing cryptocurrencies (not named Bitcoin) that are unleashing the bulls right now.Start of Another Bitcoin/Crypto Bull-Run?We\u2019ve gotten pretty used to hearing about the rapid demise of most major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin price 00 lost more than 80 percent of its value in 12 months. ETH tanked by over 90 percent. Crypto, in general, is in danger of sliding into oblivion.It\u2019s been a long while since most people in this space woke up without flutters in their chest\u2013if they even slept at all.Sure, the recent breakout has caused more speculative eyes to turn to Bitcoin. It\u2019s more popular than SpaceX and Elon Musk as far as Google searches go, in fact. But, whether BTC has truly hit is bottom or not takes a steely-nerved analyst to call.However, all the nervous HODLers watching Bitcoin activity may lead them to miss some extraordinary results. The numbers never lie. Checking out the percentage performances of these all-star altcoins against their prices this time last year might just make you feel a little bit bullish.The $crypto bull run has already started.Prices since last year:$RVN: +387%$ENJ: +382%$BNB: +303%$HOT: +188%$BAT: +173%$LTC: +157%$IOST: +122%$ONT: +111%$BCH: +87%$ADA: +82%$NANO: +81%$LINK: +72%$VET: +71%$ICX: +57%$BTC: +37%$NEO: +36%$TRX: +32%$ETH: +24%\u2014 The Rhythm Trader (@Rhythmtrader) April 21, 2019The Top 5 Altcoins Leading the Charge1. Ravencoin (RVN)Ravencoin may have had its ups and downs. But then again, which cryptocurrency hasn\u2019t? Granted, the constantly moving background on its website may make you feel somewhat seasick, but that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that it\u2019s building a substantial following.And when it comes to price, there aren\u2019t many cryptocurrencies that can claim to be doing (way!) better than this time last year. RVN 00 is up by a staggering 387 percent\u2013and they call this a bear market.2. Enjin Coin (ENJ)Popular with gamers, it\u2019s not really surprising that ENJ 00 finds a place on this list. Like it or not, the catalyst for major blockchain adoption will likely come through the geeks with joysticks.Enjin Coin has a solid history of outperforming Bitcoin. What can we say? The streamlined gaming experience is a more pressing need than an alternative financial system to most. It\u2019s recently announced support for Binance Chain is also undoubtedly helping its climbing valuation.With ENJ allowing DApps to build blockchain games, and \u201ccreate custom tokens and contracts from scratch,\u201d this altcoin now finds itself up a massive 382 percent from this time last year.3. Binance Coin (BNB)It\u2019s hard to even start when it comes to BNB 00. Even the staunchest of Bitcoin maximalist holds some respect for this power exchange token\u2013or, at least, the powerful creator behind it who, in his own words, \u201cshills BNB from time to time.\u201dHow I use TwitterI seek and provide positive energyI block negativity/annoyanceI be myself, a normal guy, nothing fancyI interact with our supportive communityI retweet when you shill @binanceI shill #BNB once in a whileI thank my 300k followers. pic.twitter.com/V7iuTfRYkK\u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) March 16, 2019On first glance, a token that incentivizes reduced fees and a few perks to its holders isn\u2019t all that exciting. But throw in the launch of the mighty DEX Binance Chain, major IEOs on the Binance Launchpad, and the social media presence of Changpeng Zhao and, well, it\u2019s hardly surprising that Binance Coin is one of the major contenders in this new bull run.BNB is now up 303 percent from this time last year. Nice work, @cz_binance, can you retweet this post?4. Holo (HOT)Holo (HOT) 00 seems just a little obnoxious at first. After all, another blockchain company claiming that the internet is broken is hardly a revelation.It\u2019s so perfectly \u201cdecentralized\u201d that scaling isn\u2019t an issue and, in fact, the company claims its technology is so sophisticated that it doesn\u2019t consider itself an actual blockchain, but rather, a distributed cloud run by its users.However, hats off to the persistent team whose supporters include Mozilla and Deloitte; it\u2019s certainly finding its audience. HOT cryptocurrency, true to its name, is up by a whopping 188 percent since this time last year.5. Basic Attention Token (BAT)Is it the awesome name showing that the company understands the human attention span is now significantly shorter than that of a goldfish that made BAT soar some 173 percent in a year? Or is it a listing on Coinbase? Blockchain-based digital advertising is riveting in itself, but being exceptionally easy to get hold of can\u2019t hurt either.Whatever your feelings about the above altcoins, the facts remain: if their winning streaks are anything to go by, \u2018atlseason\u2019 is already here.In fact, this kind of progress goes to show the real necessity of a bear market after all. It flushes out failing and uncompetitive projects, allowing companies with serious promise to rise above the rest.Does the stellar performance of these altcoins suggest altseason is upon us?

One of such events is based on Game of Thrones, the hit TV show from HBO.Platform users can predict who will sit on the Iron Throne of Westeros at the end of the eighth and final season of the show which is currently airing.The betting pool for Game of Thrones employs a time-weighted multiplier system which means that the rewards decrease as time progresses.

Other options include Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen, and Bran Stark, among others.An excerpt from the website explaining the rules of the game reads:In case there is no winner, or somebody other than the characters listed wins the Iron Throne, \u201cUnknown\u201d will win the bet. If more than one person shares the Iron Throne, the prize money will be divided equally between users betting on the winning outcomes.As at press time, \u201cUnknown\u201d is the second most popular choice, with 20 percent of all bets placed. The total prize pool has also already crossed the 1.5 BTC mark ($7,900) with the multiplier at a little over 73x.Bitcoin Betting PoolsApart from Game of Thrones, the platform has also launched some other betting pools for events like the UEFA Champions League, the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup, and the end-of-year Bitcoin price 00.Each pool utilizes the same time-weighted multiplier system with early wagers standing the chance to win more BTC. The UEFA Champions League pool is the most popular, narrowly beating the Game of Thrones pool.The platform which reportedly has about 18.7 million registered users seems to be establishing creative ways to get people to place wagers with their BTC.Bitcoin faucets continue to be a popular way for people to earn BTC for free either by playing a variety of games or via referral programs.Do you think Huatie HengAn was secretly mining cryptocurrencies under the guise of could computing?

At the same time, overall volatility is actually in decline as Bitcoin adoption spreads. Bitcoin Price Volatility Triples in AprilThe volatility of bitcoin price has surged nearly 200 percent from a monthly low of 1.26 percent to 3.31 between April 1 and April 2, according to Bitvol.info. Currently, the volatility stands at 3.54 percent.This occurred as BTC/USD skyrocketed by 22 percent in just the span of one hour propelling the cryptocurrency above $5,000 for the first time in 5 months.Since the early April surge, the price has remained in a relatively tight range between $4,900 and $5400 amid bullish forecasts and other indicators possibly signaling a market bottom.Bitcoin Volatility Decreasing With TimeThe given volatility index gauges the price movement of BTC price over the past 30 days. Currently, the volatility stands at 3.54 percent, the highest in 3 months.Overall, bitcoin price volatility has actually been declining over the years. In fact, 2018 was one of the least volatile periods in Bitcoin\u2019s history despite an 80 percent drop in USD value.Last year, the volatility index remained under 4 percent for most of the year. The only exceptions being the tail-end of the January 2018 crypto market price peak and the November-December period when BTC/USD saw a steep plunge below the $6,000 mark.Data from the past 8 years shows a clear downtrend in overall spot price volatility. Despite the 80+ percent changes in bitcoin price in 2018, today\u2019s fluctuations are nothing compared to Bitcoin\u2019s early years when the price could easily move +/- 100 percent in a single day.No One Wants a Stable BitcoinOne of the most common criticisms of Bitcoin is that it is too volatile. Its wild fluctuations in price, the argument goes, means it cannot be money. Because its USD equivalent value transferred can diminish (or rise) in seconds.This concern falls flat though because this problem is solved by BTC payment processors, stablecoins and other solutions.At the same time, fluctuations in spot price shouldn\u2019t be too surprising as bitcoin emission doesn\u2019t follow typical supply and demand. This is why many traders and investors actually love the chaos of bitcoin price 00 volatility. When price moves, everyone pays attention.It is these volatile days, in particular, that have given traders the biggest returns, compared to the rest of the year. This is the time of maximum opportunity and likely why having a low time preference and \u2018hodling\u2018 \u2014 instead of trying to time the market \u2014 has proven to be a successful strategy for many Bitcoin investors.Volatility Boosts Bitcoin AwarenessAs Bitcoinist previous reported, overall interest in bitcoin also lags behind price moves. Google search trends over the past month reveal that the phrase \u201cbuy Bitcoin\u201d spiked a day after the price surge caught everyone off guard.As price moves (in either direction), people want to know why. What is Bitcoin? Should they buy now? Should they sell? Why is it rising so fast?Moreover, virtually everything in the cryptocurrency space mirrors the bitcoin price chart.

Meanwhile, the long-to-shorts ratio has reached a decisive moment. Is a Bitcoin breakout imminent?Bitcoin Price: Market OverviewOver the weekend Bitcoin price 00 lost the hourly and 4-hour uptrend as it slipped below the 26ema and closed in on the $5,200 support. One hopes this is the result of low volume over the holiday weekend but it also notable that shorts have been on the rise and now approach a monthly high. As analyst FilbFilb pointed out in his trading journal, the long to shorts ratio approaches 1:1 and over the past Bitcoin has pulled off explosive moves in this technical setup. BTC Longs-t0-Shorts1-Hour ChartBTC/USD remains range-bound between $4900 and $5360 and its possible that the digital asset is beginning to consolidate on the daily timeframe. Generally, bitcoin remains in good order above as long as it can sustain above the 12ema for the short-term. As evidenced by the hourly chart, BTC price has relatively consistent support near $5,200 which aligns with the 61.8% Fib retracement level and Sunday\u2019s drop below the 26ema was little cause of commotion as BTC is already in the process of crossing above the 20ma on the Bollinger band indicator and the RSI and Stoch are beginning to climb into bullish territory. 4-Hour ChartWhile there were a few close calls at the $5,200 support, BTC remains in the ascending channel with bull and bear volume on the decline. The Stoch appears on the verge of a bull cross from the oversold region and buyers have shown interest from $5,170 to $5,230. Traders looking for a quick scalp could look for entries around this point and exit at $5,335 while longs could enter near $5,200 with a stop loss at break even.

The cryptocurrency gained around 40 percent of its value since the beginning of the year. Interestingly enough, it is now outpeforming NASDAQ, the S&P 500 as well as most commodities including gold and oil. Bitcoin Outperforms NASDAQ 100 (NDX)Bitcoin is often compared to stocks and traditional assets, particularly in terms of price valuation. As Bitcoinist reported last year, the cryptocurrency has managed to outperform the stock value of marquee companies such as Amazon, JD.com, and iQiyi.With Q1 2019 already behind us, BTC/USD has been performing comparatively better than a lot of traditional assets, stocks, and indexes.Bitcoin price 00 is up 40 percent so far in 2019. Nasdaq 100 (NDX), on the other hand, which is an index tracking the stock prices of companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and so forth, is only up by about 22 percent.Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index (S&P 500), one of the most prominently used investment indexes on the market, is up by about 17 percent since the start of 2019.Bitcoin Outperforms Oil and Other CommoditiesIt\u2019s not just the stock market that Bitcoin seems to be dominating. Commodities are also behind in terms of price performance in 2019.Invesco\u2019s DB commodity Index tracking fund, which is comprised of commodities such as heating oil, gasoline, gold, corn, soybeans, and so forth, has been growing in 2019, marking an increase by around 10 percent. Obviously, this is still nowhere near Bitcoin\u2019s performance.Looking at certain commodities individually, oil is perhaps the only thing that comes close to Bitcoin\u2019s impressive performance throughout the year. US Oil Fund LP Units are up by about 35 percent since the beginning of the year.Gold, on the other hand, which is often compared with Bitcoin\u2019s \u2018digital gold\u2019 is actually down 1 percent in 2019.The Best is Yet to Come?Irrespective of Bitcoin\u2019s strong performance, many believe that the best is yet to come. As Bitcoinist reported, the Mayer Multiple, which is a key Bitcoin indicator which managed to correctly call the bottom back in 2015, is once again showing that the cryptocurrency\u2019s worst days are over.On another note, Bitcoin has managed to retain the gains made during its latest rally. According to a recent report by a popular cryptocurrency hedge fund, this is a very \u201cpositive sign.\u201dMoreover, the report outlined that if this continues to happen for another week or two, it could lead to further appreciation in the price and a potential shot at the $5,500 level.Will Bitcoin continue outperforming traditional markets throughout 2019?

Mahmudov was accompanied on the podcast by trading analyst and Woobull.com creator Willy Woo, Adaptive Capital\u2019s head of research David Puell, Adamant Capital\u2019s Tuur Demeester and developer Venzen Khaosan.The marathon five-and-a-half-hour event saw everyone delve into the specifics of Bitcoin price performance to determine the market\u2019s future moves, with Woo, Mahmudov, Paul and Demeester all saying no lower lows would appear. April BTC Surge WatershedAs Bitcoinist reported, when Bitcoin hit its recent bottom of $3130 in December, opinions favored stagnation between $3000 and $3500 or \u2013 in the case of Vays specifically \u2013 further drops to a low as $1000.Tone VaysWhile Vays has now lessened the chances of that scenario occurring to 40 percent, the bullish group\u2019s outlook is comparatively parabolic. Woo, who explained his stance based on \u201cintuition\u201d from charts he handles, came out more positive than anyone, claiming it was 95 percent certain Bitcoin price had bottomed at $3130.Demeester followed with 80 percent, while Mahmudov and Puell awarded a likelihood of 75 and 70 percent respectively. He noted:After this spike in early April, the 200-day median was finally broken \u2013 we\u2019re currently quite above it; I believe overall we will see a retracement around that area but\u2026 I think it\u2019s going to start acting as support. At press time April 22, BTC/USD hovered around $5290, roughly the middle of its 24-hour trading range which saw highs of $5326. Last week, Demeester released a report into Bitcoin investor patterns which likewise placed Bitcoin price in an accumulation phase.Another increasing trend focuses on the 2020 Bitcoin block reward halving. Traditionally seen to boost Bitcoin price in advance, the impact of next year could be felt as soon as June 2019, research suggested earlier in April.What do you think about the conclusions from the Understand Bitcoin podcast?

(ETH) can do much more than (BNB) in features. Let\u2019s grow together[.]While Zhao has become known for his unwillingness to take sides in championing one coin or another, his defence of ETH is especially conspicuous as the latter continues to struggle with publicity woes. As Bitcoinist reported, the backbone of ICOs has faced a barrage of criticism over its prowess from newcomers over the past year, specifically EOS (EOS) and Justin Sun\u2019s Tron (TRX).Sun in particular has been highly vocal about his dislike of Ethereum, frequently calling on projects using its network to migrate. Zhao, however, even actively praised both the network and those who develop and maintain it. \u201c(The ETH) dev community is unmatched.

Let\u2019s see how it plays out.\u201dWeiss Suggests BNB Is The \u2018New Bitcoin\u2019Despite the plug, however, market sentiment around ETH remained flat. In the 24 hours to press time, despite Bitcoin price\u2019s rapid advance to new 2019 highs, ETH/USD managed to climb just 3.1 percent. The lack of effect was all the more pronounced in light of BNB\u2019s own recent surges, buoyed by Zhao\u2019s regular support on social media. At the same time, a threat and subsequent decision to delist another altcoin, Bitcoin SV, from Binance, saw its price drop like a stone within hours. As the native token of Binance which is set to play a major role as the exchange metamorphoses into a decentralized ecosystem, BNB 00 has meanwhile become one of 2019\u2019s best performing cryptocurrencies.Prior to Binance releasing the first elements of its decentralized exchange Tuesday, The token hit a new all-time high in both USD and BTC terms over the weekend, peaking at around $25 before a slight correction entered.

A central bank could reduce the policy rate from, say, 2 percent to minus 4 percent to counter a severe recession,\u201d the blog post read.

Others followed suit, wryly thanking the IMF for endorsing keeping wealth outside the fiat-based financial system. How Bad Is Bitcoin Anyway?As Bitcoinist reported, the organization has so far failed to offer a definitive perspective on Bitcoin. In a blog post earlier this month, managing director Christine Lagarde called for a balanced reception of the industry, echoing previous statements in which she refused to dismiss the phenomenon.The line runs in stark contrast to the much more damning verdicts from other global financial structures such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).\u201cAbove all, we must keep an open mind about crypto assets and financial technology more broadly, not only because of the risks they pose, but also because of their potential to improve our lives,\u201d she wrote.At its annual Spring Meetings event in Washington last week meanwhile, the IMF, together with the World Bank, listened to no fewer than three countries express their determination to issue a Bitcoin bond. This, argued representatives of Afghanistan, Tunisia and Uzbekistan, could shore up industry in the face of problematic borrowing access.Facilitating its issuance would be Blockchain technologies such as Hyperledger, Afghanistan added.What do you think about the IMF\u2019s accidental Bitcoin shill?

Had you threw in just $100 bucks into BTC in 2010, you would be a millionaire today.Bitcoin ROI Shows Why They\u2019re Called \u2018Altcoins\u2019A new visual graph from DataLight perfectly illustrates just how impressive Bitcoin ROI (return on investment) has been over the past decade.Buying just $100 USD worth of Bitcoin in mid-2010 would have netted you a cool $1.3 million today. That is if you managed to \u2018hodl\u2019 instead of \u2018sodl\u2019 your precious bits until today.By comparison, every other cryptocurrency has been dwarfed by BTC when it comes to ROI since being first listed on an exchange.Granted, when it comes to trading on exchanges, Bitcoin has an almost 3-year head start even on Litecoin, one of the oldest \u2018altcoins\u2019 and the first to use the Scrypt hashing algorithm. But for those banking on the \u2018silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold\u2019 to beat Bitcoin\u2019s returns anytime soon may be out of luck.Certainly, Litcoin has seen some impressive rips in recent years. However, the price of Litecoin has had a much different trajectory while being at the mercy of BTC market cycles.For example, LTC/USD peaked at around $35 in November 2013. These same price levels then repeated in July 2017\u2026.and again in January 2019. This is more reflective of speculative, pump-n-dump behavior than a (secondary) store of value.Bitcoin, on the other hand, stands out as it continues to post higher highs after every bubble making it the perennial leader of cryptocurrencies today.Ethereum (ETH) 00 has been the best performing altcoin since its exchange debut in 2015. One hundred bucks into Ethereum would have netted you roughly $68,000 today at around $170 per ETH. Though, undoubtedly, this figure would be much higher at Ethereum\u2019s all-time high of nearly $1,400 in January 2018.Bitcoin-branded forks like Bitcoin Cash, meanwhile, have fared even worse, actually depreciating in value since their inception.Bitcoin Apples to Altcoin OrangesMore recently, Bitcoinist highlighted the stellar performance of Binance Coin (BNB) 00, which has skyrocketed in value since launching in mid-2017. In fact, it has become the first cryptocurrency to surpass the January 2018 all-time high.At the same time, comparing in-house digital tokens like BNB (and pretty much every other \u2018alt\u2019 with a foundation or a company behind it) to Bitcoin is like comparing apples to oranges.Indeed, every single altcoin is paired against bitcoin by default for a reason. Admittedly, some altcoins have performed marvelously against BTC since their inception, particularly on shorter timeframes.But as the saying goes: the faster they rise, the faster they fall.That\u2019s because their low market caps on exchanges are both a weakness and a strength. In bull-markets, for example, a lower cap means a coin can be pumped much easier allowing it to outpace the gains of high cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.On longer timeframes, however, the story repeats over and over again as Bitcoin demonstrates who\u2019s king.Think Your Favorite Altcoin Can Beat BTC? Good Luck.Therefore, it is no surprise that Bitcoin, being a truly leaderless, decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency, has attracted the most network effect and hashing power to be the most secure blockchain today.Subsequently, this gives investor confidence more confidence in Bitcoin above all. It also means that it\u2019s the de facto choice for trustlessly transferring value over any other cryptocurrency regardless of fees.It\u2019s also no coincidence that the SEC is considering approving a Bitcoin ETF only. It\u2019s why Bitcoin trading instruments have been the first to hit traditional markets; and why investors are increasingly calling it \u2018irresponsible\u2019 not to have exposure to BTC in 2019.In fact, data has shown that allocating only 1 percent of one\u2019s portfolio to bitcoin historically outperforms the S&P 500, gold and US Treasury bonds.But, more importantly, it also highlights the possibility of a Lindy effect, suggesting that the \u2018internet of money\u2019 could be a zero-sum game. If so, then betting on \u2018the next bitcoin\u2019 looks more like gambling.

This new level also adds further weight to the increasingly prevalent sentiment that the market is turning bullish.Bitcoin Price Hits Fresh 2019 HighsBitcoin price (BTC) 00 has hit fresh 2019 high breaking key resistance at the previous high of $5450. Bitcoin now truly appears to be climbing out of a bear market that began in January 2018 when the cryptocurrency saw its all time high of nearly $20,000.As Bitcoinist market analyst FilbFilb noted yesterday,\u2026[A]ll indicators suggest that Bitcoin wants to continue higher and all that is required is more of the same buying pressure over the next couple of weeks, which would potentially lead to a retest of the old support at $6000. Failing that, the $4000 level is now likely to act as strong support if it is tested.This bullish scenario appears to be playing out. Now, bitcoin price is eyeing the $6,000 level, which will likely determine where the market is ultimately headed this year.Breaking $6k could be the final nail in the coffin for the bears too. This level is critical. It was the $6,000 range that served as support for nearly four months from August to November 2018.Today, Bitcoin is up over 60 percent from the lows record during the first week in February and 58% from last year\u2019s low. These gains also mean that BTC is now outperforming most traditional stocks, commodities, NASDAQ, and the S&P 500 so far this year.Incoming Golden Cross?Additional fuel for Bitcoin may come from a \u2018golden cross\u2019 or when the 50-day moving average moves above the 200-day MA, a very bullish signal.Overall, market sentiment is clearly shifting. As Bitcoinist reported yesterday, even bearish traders are starting to flip.Up until recently, prominent Bitcoin market analyst Murad Mahmudov, for example, was bearish on BTC/USD, saying he doesn\u2019t expect a new bull-run until Q2 2020. Today, he is 75 percent sure the bottom is in.Additionally, analyst Tone Vays has also lessened the chances of his predicted $1k bottom to 40 percent. Meanwhile, Willy Woo, says that he\u2019s 95 percent certain the bitcoin price bottom occurred in mid-December 2018.While earlier this month, veteran trader, Peter Brandt, who called Bitcoin\u2019s $20K top,\u201d says it wouldn\u2019t surprise him if Bitcoin price enters a new parabolic phase.Numerous Indicators Suggest the Market Has TurnedMore good news for the bulls are also coming from numerous indicators. The Mayer Mutliple (MM), for example, has risen above 1.0 signaling the establishment of a long-term bottom for bitcoin price.Rising institutional interest, return of Korea\u2019s \u2018Kimchi premium\u2018 and Chinese traders paying a markup for Tethers, allowing easier access to crypto markets, are among the other signs pointing to a Bitcoin uptrend.Meanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s fundamentals are stronger than ever while the halving, which is expected to reduce sell-pressure on the market, is now less than 400 days away.It\u2019s still too early to definitively say that Bitcoin is now in a bull market.

As such, there is little surprise that investors and speculators alike are starting to pay attention to the crypto space one again.Adding weight to the move in price, BTC/USD has recorded ten of the fifteen weeks of the year with green volume candles and is now onto its eleventh higher high on the MACD. This is unprecedented, even for Bitcoin, and shows the momentum in price that the move has had to date.The MACD itself is still some way below the zero line but it is on course to break to the bullish side if Bitcoin can continue the momentum this week.For perspective the last time it broke to the bullish side was in October of 2016, when Bitcoin broke out of the previous bear market, although there was a near miss and close call in 2015.Bitcoin Price: 2015 vs 2019When comparing the previous bear market bottom and 2019, Bitcoin was held back by the 50 WMA and generally speaking, the whole bottom cycle took longer compared to 2019 lows and current bear market cycle.The difference in 2019 is that Bitcoin looks a lot stronger in 2019 in terms of volume, which has supported the first attempt to break the 50 WMA.The final move out of the 2016 lows came with a large spike in volume, similar to that seen on the second of April.Therefore, although the 50 WMA has historically been a major barrier, bitcoins current momentum could see it break this resistance upon first attempt following this strong period of consolidation.Volume ProfileLooking at the volume profile on the weekly chart, its clear that the price of bitcoin is consolidating within the range that previously saw a lot of volume. The next high volume of trading levels, meanwhile, are above at $6000.It is likely that this area will act as resistance initially if the bulls can make a new yearly high above $5467, which is certainly in play at this stage.The VPVR point of control is effectively at the April low, from which bitcoin broke out from. So if there was any kind of breakdown, the $4000 level, supported by the 200 WMA (now at $3500) should act as support.4-Hour ChartLooking at the price action early on Monday morning, its clear to see that BTC price has established a trading range between $5200 and $5350, with the bulls showing strength already above $5300 being a very positive sign.A clear close above $5350 would be an extremely bullish sign for the bulls, which would then look to consolidate before pressing on to take out the annual highs that are $100 above.A fall below $5200 would possibly open the door to a retest of the lows last week, which would certainly be a sign of weakness for the bulls. The stochastic RSI, however, is crossed bullish, which has led to higher prices in each of the previous time of asking. So this would indicate the bulls will likely attempt to break out of the $5350 range.BTC Price Bulls Eyeing $6,000In summary, all indicators suggest that Bitcoin wants to continue higher and all that is required is more of the same buying pressure over the next couple of weeks which would potentially lead to a retest of the old support at $6000. Failing that, the $4000 level is now likely to act as strong support if it is tested.Trade Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

It also broke through the $5,600 price mark, setting a new 2019 high. Golden Cross: Another Bullish Signal for BitcoinA golden cross chart pattern has formed for Bitcoin with the 50-day moving average (MA) crossing the 200-day MA for BTC to the upside.Earlier on Tuesday (April 23, 2019), Bitcoinist had indicated that the golden cross pattern for BTC price was imminent. The golden cross, regarded as a \u201choly grail\u201d pattern provides yet another sign that Bitcoin is entering a new bull market.Late October 2015 was the last time a golden cross pattern appeared on the Bitcoin price chart. That moment also corresponded to the end of the 2014/2015 bear market phase which would later culminate in the massive bull-run of late 2017.New Highs for 2019The appearance of the golden cross comes at the time when Bitcoin has set another 2019 high, this time going beyond $5,600. BTC [coin _price] is up 35 percent in April alone and almost 51 percent since the start of the year.The formation of the golden cross indicates a BTC uptrend, which corresponds to the second phase of a golden cross formation. A continuation of this uptrend would solidify the argument that Bitcoin has entered a bullish cycle.Bitcoin bulls will now be looking to see if both the price and the 50-day MA stays above the 200-day MA confirming the bull market argument.After the last golden cross in October 2015, BTC traded sideways, setting successive higher highs and higher lows. This pattern continued until November of 2017 before it went parabolic hitting nearly $20,000 a matter of weeks.Bitcoin Back in the Bull Market?With the price of bitcoin moving further away from the December 2018 low of $3,100, the argument of whether BTC/USD has bottomed out continues to gather steam.Numerous indicators and experts are beginning to form a consensus that Bitcoin has indeed bottomed out. Analysts like Murad Mahmudov have even flipped their calls from bearish to bullish, agreeing that BTC has most likely set a new long-term bottom.Each significant uptrend solidifies the interpretation of $3,100 as the BTC long-term bottom price thus creating a more positive market sentiment.Analysts at Adamant Capital published their findings last week concluding that BTC is currently in an accumulation phase. The researchers add that they expect Bitcoin to trade between $3,000 and $6,500 during this period in the lead up to the next bull-run, which have historically dwarfed previous all-time highs in parabolic fashion.Do you think the BTC bull run has begun?

And while some altcoins have managed to increase even surpass BTC, others have been left hanging in the dry. Below we take a look at the 5 worst performing cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin so far in 2019.Ethereum (ETH)Ironically, the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of total market capitalization has been declining in value against BTC. ETH/BTC 00 is down about 14 percent so far in 2019. However, against the dollar, ETH has managed to gain around 31 percent. Meanwhile, Ethereum\u2019s network is facing increasing competition, especially now that Binance has announced the launch of the mainnet of its decentralized exchange Binance Chain. While Changpeng Zhao has explicitly expressed his stance that Binance Chain doesn\u2019t intend to compete with Ethereum, it\u2019s entirely possible that certain projects may choose to migrate, especially given the upside price potential already witnessed this year. Ripple (XRP)XRP 00 is another altcoin that has experienced a notable drop in its value against Bitcoin. Since the beginning of 2019, the cryptocurrency has lost almost 40 percent when trading against BTC. More alarmingly, XRP has also failed to capitalize on the entire market\u2019s surge throughout the year as it has decreased against the US dollar. XRP is down about 8.5 on that front as well. According to some reports, Ripple is facing increasing competition in the face of \u2018bankcoins\u2019 such as the first bank-backed cryptocurrency, JPM Coin, as well as its closest rival Stellar (XLM). Bitcoin SV (BSV)Bitcoin SV 00 has surely seen better days albeit only existing since November 2018. The altcoin is down 55 percent against BTC and about 30 percent against the USD. This year has also seen around $450 million wiped off its total market capitalization. Bitcoin SV\u2019s decline was further propelled by its delisting from major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Kraken, following Craig Wright\u2019s move to sue users for calling him a fraud. IOTA (MIOTA)IOTA 00 is a protocol touted as the \u201cnext generation of distributed ledger technology.\u201d Unfortunately, fancy wording doesn\u2019t seem to be enough for its native cryptocurrency, MIOTA, which is down 40 percent against BTC. MIOTA\u2019s price doesn\u2019t look so much better when trading against the USD either. The cryptocurrency is down about 15 percent, losing around $120 million of its total market cap since the start of 2019. Tron (TRX)Despite the \u2018constant developments\u2019 outlined by its founder Justin Sun, TRX 00 has also failed to capitalize on the strong performance of the cryptocurrency market in 2019. While it hasn\u2019t marked any major declines, the fact that it didn\u2019t do well while almost everything else was surging is sufficient. TRX/BTC has lost about 10 percent. Things are better when looking at its performance against the USD. TRX has managed to gain about 35 percent since the beginning of 2019, which is perhaps expected, given the overall market rally. Hence Why They Are \u2018Altcoins\u2019As Bitcoinist reported, Bitcoin has dwarfed every other altcoin when it comes to returns on investment (ROI) since initial exchange listing.Moreover, the latest rally has also managed to regain Bitcoin\u2019s strength relative to the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization. Though being a rather poor metric, the Bitcoin dominance index now sits at 53.2 percent marking an increase of almost three percent throughout the last month.What do you think of the above cryptocurrencies?

Nexon is 47 percent owned by NXC, the chairman of which, Jung-ju Kim, is behind the shares sale. According to JoongAng Ilbo, various major entities had taken an interest in the stake. These include Tencent and Kakao, both of which are currently pursuing cryptocurrency-related projects of their own.Disney, however, is allegedly first in line, with Kim personally reaching out to the US corporation. Should the $13.2 billion deal go ahead, however, Disney will have access to European exchange Bitstamp via NXC\u2019s investment structure NXMH, which purchased it for around $400 million in late 2018.Also under control would be South Korean mainstream platform Korbit, in which Nexon has a 65 percent stake.Rumors Of A Done DealAccording to the Herald, the NXC mogul had held a soft spot for Disney for some time, spurring the belief that the deal would likely have a specific outcome.\u201cWhat I envy the most about Disney is that they do not force money out of kids\u2026 (consumers) gladly pay Disney. Nexon has a long way to go. Some people hate Nexon to death,\u201d it quotes him as saying in 2015. Disney itself has hardly any experience in the cryptocurrency industry, with the exception of a lackluster ICO project dubbed \u2018DragonChain\u2019 in 2017. While the new owner could thus jettison its newly-acquired crypto portfolio, the track record of both platforms could yet prove appealing as the cryptocurrency market undergoes its latest renaissance. Last week, Bitstamp became one of the few businesses to complete the process of gaining a BitLicense certification to serve users in New York. \u201cWe look forward to carrying the lessons we\u2019ve learned in Europe over the ocean and helping to develop a better environment for all crypto businesses, both in the US and worldwide,\u201d the company wrote in an accompanying blog post.Korbit also continues to press on despite the 2018 bear market proving tough on its financial health. This month, figures showed net annual losses for the previous twelve months totalled around 45 billion won ($40 million), still less than market heavyweight Bithumb, which shed closer to $180 million.What do you think about Disney potentially gaining a stake in Bitstamp and Korbit?

Let\u2019s look at why Bitcoin mining would be the perfect solution to capture this energy \u2018waste\u2019 and transform it into sound money. Texas \u2018Energy Waste\u2019 Rises 85%According to a recent Bloomberg report, America\u2019s Permian Basin, a large sedimentary basin located in the southwestern part of the country, is producing so much natural gas that at some point producers had to burn some of it off.This process is referred to as \u201cflaring\u201d and it\u2019s carried out when it makes more sense to burn the gas than to efficiently capture and store it. As oil production in the region surge, so does flaring.The report also outlines that at the end of 2018, producers were burning off more than enough fuel to meet the entire residential demand of the whole state of Texas. Compared to last year, the amount of gas flared in the Permian has increased by about 85 percent.A Problem in Need of a Solution\u2026Speaking on the matter was Scott Sheffield, Chief Executive Officer at Pioneer Natural Resources, who said:It\u2019s a black eye for the Permian Basin. [\u2026] The state, the pipeline companies and the producers \u2014 we all need to come together to figure out a way to stop the flaring.The main challenge in front of the industry is that there are not enough pipelines to get the gas to the consumers. This is also why, at some point, producers were actually paying their customers to take the gas.Besides pure financial issues, however, flaring is also undoubtedly causing a lot of environmental damage. The process is also producing serious amounts of carbon dioxide, which has reportedly contributed more than any other driver to climate change between 1750 and 2011.\u2026Which Already ExistsAs Bitcoinist reported earlier in March, the solution that the state of Texas is desperately looking for might already be here: mining bitcoin.A project, headed by oilman and bitcoin entrepreneur Stephen Barbour, has embarked on tackling the issues of excessive oil and gas production and the consequential flaring.Barbour has installed a generator to a shipping container full of mining rigs and placed it at a remote oil field in Canada. Its sole purpose is to convert natural gas into electricity and to power the rigs. In order for the machines to operate 24/7, the unit is using about 400 cubic meters of natural gas per day.Of course, the investment needed to buy and convert a regular shipping container into a facility of the kind can round up at $130,000 before factoring in the price of mining rigs.However, apart from tackling the excessive waste of natural gas (which will save money), it would also result in highly profitable mining of bitcoin since the energy would not only be free, but producers may even pay miners to utilize it.Barbour says bitcoin mining enables transforming energy that would otherwise go to waste into \u201cfinancial freedom.\u201dSun shines.Water absorbs heat.Rejects into atmosphere.Falls.Drives turbine.Moves electrons.Runs computer.Calculates small numbers.Financial freedom for people all over the world.#bitcoin\u2014 Steve Barbour \u26cf (@SGBarbour) March 20, 2019What\u2019s more, the mined bitcoin can then be used toward environmental conservation efforts, improve local infrastructure, or just about anything else.Given that there are no other foreseeable solutions apart from the constant structuring of additional pipelines, this does sound like the perfect idea for Texas and bitcoin mining investors to look into.Can Bitcoin mining help Texas capitalize on its \u2018energy waste\u2019?

Some, like Bolivia, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, have even tried to outright ban it. The problem is, no matter what regulators say, there are four major reasons why Bitcoin is unbannable.1. Laws Can\u2019t Be Written Against Bits and BitesThere\u2019s a saying in the Bitcoin community that you still hear from time to time:You can take your country out of bitcoin, but you can\u2019t take bitcoin out of your country.Why? Because it is actually impossible to write laws against a protocol vastly superior to the human subjective legal system. Governments may \u201cban bitcoin,\u201d but their people will continue to use it.Azte.co founder Akin Fernandez points out in this article that regulators are too quick to enforce laws on a software protocol that needs no regulation. Bitcoin is no different from WhatsApp, after all, in that they are both software platforms transmitting data. WhatsApp now has over a billion users and no law was written around it. Moreover, Bitcoin, unlike fiat, can be transferred in a binding promise that is unbreakable. The software already enforces the law and obedience to the contract. Moreover, Fernandez argues that to try to regulate Bitcoin in the United States would go against the First Amendment of the Constitution. They would need to rewrite it completely before enforcing laws on Bitcoin.The sad fact remains that most countries are aiming to regulate something that they don\u2019t understand. You can\u2019t write fair and practical laws against bits and bytes, end of story.2. You Can\u2019t Ban Open-Source Distributed SoftwareThe internet can be censored, partially. Sites can be banned, and governments in dictatorial countries can even block access to the internet for all. That\u2019s because the internet still relies on centralized servers that ISP providers and governments can control.Bitcoin is unbannable because it relies on node decentralization. Its distributed software has grown large enough globally that it is impossible to shut down. Even if every country in the world came together to ban bitcoin (which would revoke the First Amendment in the U.S. and cause an uproar across the free world) they would find that Bitcoin is unbannable.And in the extreme and unlikely case that all its core developers were killed tomorrow and access were hijacked by the IMF, the software is already in the wild, which means users simply won\u2019t download the new hijacked version. They will continue running the software that\u2019s already working as everyone can see and audit the code.That Bitcoin relies heavily on the internet is still a strong argument\u2013today. However, through mesh networking, node decentralization, and opensource distributed software, that reliance is not total.There are plenty of mechanisms working on this in place. For example, you can run a bitcoin node using Tor, as Satoshi recommended. In fact, as irony would have it, they are even running in China, where government approval is technically required.3. Bitcoin Can Be Broadcasted via SatelliteIn December last year, Blockstream launched its fifth satellite streaming the Bitcoin blockchain from space. This venture solves to make the Bitcoin network more robust and less dependent on the internet.Bitcoin network satellite coverageBlockstream CEO Adam Back told Forbes at the time:We see the increased robustness of the bitcoin network and the lower cost of participation contributing to helping businesses rely on the service for backup, and for emerging markets to use as their primary access to the bitcoin network at a lower cost.Blockstream satellites now offer coverage over the entire globe, with Greenland and Antarctica as the only exceptions. This gives people trapped in oppressive political regimes another lifeline when countries try to ban bitcoin or block the internet.4. You can Send Bitcoin Via SMSIf satellites and mesh networking weren\u2019t enough, you can also send Bitcoin via good old SMS, which is not reliant on the internet or smartphones. Bitcoin SMS payments are particularly appealing in countries like Venezuela where almost the entire population owns a mobile device of some kind, but not a smartphone.5. You Can\u2019t Shut Down the Power GridIf your rigid laws regulating something you don\u2019t understand and shutting down the internet don\u2019t work, you could always close down the power grid.But then again, you would be propeling your country back to the middle ages, angering your citizens, turning business against you, and generally creating a dystopia. Moreover, electrical engineering is a public domain and not in the control of governments to shut down. Sorry folks, try as you may, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly unbannable.What other avenues should bitcoin exploit to become more resiliant to attacks?

It seems simply to be a shift in outlook.During the bear market, there were a lot of people who sold their crypto in fear of lower prices. Those people didn\u2019t really go away though, they\u2019re simply standing on the sidelines waiting for the return of a bull market\u2026@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsNo More Iranian OilBitcoin Golden CrossMore Bullish Than EverPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of April 23rd. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsEarning\u2019s season continues, with several dozen companies reporting today. It\u2019s still too early to get an indication of the overall environment but there haven\u2019t been too many disasters so far. We\u2019ll need to watch closely over the next two weeks. Today, all eyes are on Twitter.Crude oil is also in focus after President Trump ramped up sanctions on Iran.As we know, Trump has been rolling back the Iranian sanctions that were eased by Obama. Until now, he\u2019d given permission for several countries to continue dealing with them, those permission slips have all been revoked now.The main focus of the market seems to be how Saudi Arabia will respond. It\u2019s pretty clear that they\u2019re in favor of this move because Iran is a mutual adversary both geopolitically and businesswise in the oil industry.The question is if they will increase oil production to make up for the lack of Iranian oil on the market. Many analysts think that this is a possibility in the future, but not right now. It certainly pays for them to be patient and let the price continue to rise a bit before testing the waters with any production increases.Bitcoin\u2019s Golden CrossThe latest indicator for bitcoin comes from the moving averages, which have just shown a very bullish pattern known to technical analysts as a Golden Cross.This occurs when the average price in the short term rises above the long term average price. Here we can see the 50-day moving average (red) rising above the 200-day moving average (blue) for the first time since 2015.Some people will want to wait until today\u2019s close for confirmation but in my mind, this box is ticked.Following the extraordinary surge on April 2nd, many people were looking for some sort of continuation and now that we\u2019ve broken the interim resistance of $5,350 it seems we have one.Korean Come BackOne of the most active cryptotrading nations has just shown signs that they are all-in on this current rally. According to a recent survey by the Korea Financial Investors Protection Foundation, citizens of South Korea are now more bullish than ever.The average SK hodler has invested $6,097, which represents a 64% increase from a year earlier!!In contrast to most of the rest of the world, it seems that older people have a larger propensity to crypto investments with people in their 50s showing an average investment of $11,000 per person.Due to recent allegations of wash trading in the market, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to get any sort of reliable data to map out South Korean volumes, so the above survey of 2,500 people is really the best indication we have.Also worth noting is that there doesn\u2019t seem to be any kimchi premium this time around as the liquidity of the market has improved drastically over the last two years.During the 2017 bull run, it was normal to see bitcoin\u2019s price in South Kora a good 20-30% above the rest of the market. Very glad to report that today, while South Korean exchange bithumb is slightly above the pack, the premium is only about 1%.Let\u2019s have a wonderful day ahead!Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalysteToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

The lion\u2019s share of this growth has come in April with BTC price 00 gaining about 35 percent since April 1, 2019.Pompliano, founder of Morgan Creek Digital and a known Bitcoin permabull, isn\u2019t alone in this belief. Earlier in April 2019, Chris Burniske of Placeholder \u2013 a venture capital firm, forecasted that BTC could top $1 trillion in market cap during the next bull run.Many analysts are increasing espousing the belief that BTC has bottomed out and is set for a new parabolic growth cycle. As reported by Bitcoinist on Tuesday (April 23, 2019), a golden cross pattern has formed on the BTC price chart further strengthening the notion of Bitcoin entering a bull market.BTC a More Mature Asset Compared to 2017According to Pompliano, the next BTC bull cycle will feature a more mature Bitcoin, one driven by technical and market fundamentals, instead of the hype-driven bull-run in late 2017.In an Off The Chain blog post published on Tuesday, Pompliano highlighted the significant improvements in Bitcoin\u2019s underlying fundamentals. An excerpt from the post reads:Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset. It is misunderstood by many. But one thing is certain, the digitally native currency continues to strengthen over time. As with anything important in life, the maturation and mass adoption of Bitcoin will take time.Over a two-year period, metrics like miner revenue, transaction volume, and the number of wallets have increased. Within that same period, Bitcoin has outstripped the returns of markets like the S&P 500 and gold.In the last two years, BTC has gained more than 450 percent while gains for the S&P 500 and gold stand at 19.9 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively. In 2019, it is also outperforming traditional markets and commodities including oil and gold.Meanwhile, within the period under review, BTC did experience an 80 percent slump but that\u2019s not surprising considering that it\u2019s unique compared to traditional stocks and commodities.Can Bitcoin\u2019s market cap top $5 trillion by 2024?

The next stop looks to be $6,000. HODLers are daring to dream\u2026 But, let\u2019s keep a little perspective. All major coins are still a (very) long way off their all-time-highs. That could be significant in itself, though. After all, the bounce-back can only be higher.There\u2019s Only One Way to Go From HereDo you want the good news or the bad news first? Let\u2019s start with the bad.Despite breaking through a key resistance level and forming its first golden cross since the 2015 bottom, Bitcoin (BTC) is still down a massive 72 percent from its all-time high in December 2017.Ether (ETH) is off by a whopping 88 percent, and Ripple even worse at 90 percent. Let\u2019s not get started on Bitcoin Cash\u2026 They forked themselves pretty hard back in November last year and currently down 92 percent from historic highs.Other altcoins are also struggling, namely:XRP: \u2013 90%EOS: \u2013 76%LTC: \u2013 78%ADA: \u2013 93%XLM: \u2013 87%TRX: \u2013 89%XMR: \u2013 87%DASH: \u2013 91%MIOTA: \u2013 94%NEO: \u2013 94%OMG: \u2013 92%So what\u2019s the good news then? Why are traders and HODLers across the globe getting so excited? Well, market analyst The Rhythm Trader rightly observes\u2026 with stats like this, we can only go up from here.Bitcoin Is Better Placed for a Bull Run Than in 2017Apart from the muted encouragement that things can only get better, there are a ton of other reasons why it\u2019s looking rosy for BTC. Unlike the last epic bull run, the price of bitcoin has been steadily building since 2017.There are now far better fundamentals in the shape of rising transactions, usage, and hash rates. More scams and sh**coins have been flushed out, there\u2019s more fiat on-ramps, proven uses cases, and plenty more besides.This time around, Bitcoin is scaling, has garnered major institutional support, and already proven that $20,000 is a realistic target.Meanwhile, we all must keep in mind that more nearly 80 percent of the total 21 million bitcoin have already been mined. The halving, which will reduce sell-pressure on the market, is also now less than 400 days away.Industry Insiders Calling for Parabolic GrowthWe\u2019ve all heard John McAfee\u2019s predictions\u2013and what he\u2019ll do if he\u2019s wrong. But there are plenty of other key protagonists that are equally (if not more) bullish on Bitcoin.Just yesterday, Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital made a staggering claim. That Bitcoin could become a $5 trillion asset by 2024. This is based on the rationale that Bitcoin remains the only sub-trillion-dollar asset capable of increasing by as much as 50 times in a five-year period.So, yes, the fact remains that Bitcoin still has a long way to go to recover its previous levels before blasting through them. But with the tailwinds strongly blowing, it can only go up from here.Will Bitcoin continue its uptrend?

Nasdaq has also expressed plans to establish a Bitcoin futures trading platform sometime in 2019.The addition of BTC spot trading would effectively constitute a trifecta of institutional-grade crypto adoption. Experts believe that the influx of big-money players will also act as a tailwind to push the BTC price even higher.Currently, Bitcoin price 00 is up about 50 percent since the start of 2019. Analysts and commentators alike say the top-ranked cryptocurrency has bottomed out and will experience parabolic gains in the next bull cycle.If this is indeed the case, then brokerage giants like TD Ameritrade will likely benefit from the increasing interest in Bitcoin and price gains.Do you think BTC spot trading is coming to the Nasdaq?

Meanwhile, the Bitcoin dominance index has hit its highest so far in 2019. Binance Coin StrugglesAs Bitcoinist reported last week, Binance Coin (BNB) 00 is amongst the best performing cryptocurrencies in 2019 so far. Year-to-date, the altcoin has gained around 260 percent. Moreover, a few days ago, BNB became the first to surpass its all-time high value of January 2018.On a shorter term, however, the cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t seem to be able to maintain its gains.Since its price surged towards its newly-found ATH on April 20th, BNB has pulled back, experiencing a notable decrease of around 11 percent against the USD.Against Bitcoin, BNB is down even more with a 16 percent decline.\u2018Binance Effect\u2019 Fizzles\u2026 For NowControversially, the sudden pull-back comes at times when there\u2019s a lot going on for Binance and BNB.Earlier in this month, Binance launched the mainnet for their decentralized exchange Binance Chain. Touted as a \u201cnew chapter\u201d in the history of the company, the event also set the stage for an important development for the currently existing ERC20-based BNB coins \u2013 their swap to Binance Chain.Moreover, Bitcoinist reported that every project which migrates to Binance Chain sees its token\u2019s price skyrocket on the news. Since our last report, two more projects have migrated to Binance Chain, namely Gifto (GTO), and the Blockmason Credit Protocol (BCPT). Their prices, unsurprisingly, marked notable increases following the move.On another note, Binance Launchpad \u2013 the Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) structure of the cryptocurrency exchange, is having its fourth sale today with a brand new lottery system in place. According to the official website, the ticket claim process is already in progress.Ironically, Binance Coin seems to be the only cryptocurrency that fails to capitalize on the so-called \u201cBinance Effect.\u201d\u2026Nor Does BTC Price PumpAnother thing to consider is Bitcoin\u2019s price performance throughout the same period BNB has been declining.Since April 22nd, BTC has marked yet another notable leg up, jumping from around $5,300 to $5,630 \u2013 an increase of about 6.3 percent.Bitcoin price 00 has experienced a slight pullback since its recent peak, losing about 1.5 percent on the day.However, looking at the overall cryptocurrency market reveals that BTC is actually holding relatively strong compared to other altcoins, most of which are bleeding notably.In result, the Bitcoin Dominance Index, which measures Bitcoin\u2019s relative market share by capitalization, has risen to 54.7 percent, the highest in 2019 so far.What do you think of the recent drop in the price of Binance Coin?

XRouter opens the door for multi-chain, lightweight dApps to harness contracts and protocols from different blockchains, allowing them to communicate and use each others\u2019 specific features. XRouter lays the foundation for multi-blockchain architectures and an \u201cInternet of Blockchains\u201d.XRouter is one part of the Blocknet Protocol, an infrastructure for a new era of cross-blockchain communication. The Blocknet Protocol enables the technologies on any blockchain to become available via decentralized APIs, creating a paradigm shift from monolithic architecture development to microservice and multi-chain architectures and heralds the Internet of Blockchains. You can download the Blocknet wallet with XRouter here. (In the future, the Blocknet wallet will not be required)But what is the \u201cInternet of Blockchains,\u201d? What does it actually mean in real terms?An Internet of Blockchains (IoB)A simple analogy would be that the Blocknet Protocol and XRouter is like the Netflix or Spotify for blockchains. Years ago, you had to walk to your local video store, choose a video and then return home. Then, as the industry evolved it became possible to download music and movies instead. But even then, this could sometimes take hours and took up a great deal of space on your hard drive. Recently, with the arrival of online audio and visual streaming services, access became instant and the need to download media was no longer a requirement. XRouter enables the same thing. Instead of waiting days to download whole blockchains, (the BTC blockchain is now over 240 GB) XRouter is able to offer instant, decentralized access to any blockchain without the need to download the blockchain, and as is the case with Netflix and Spotify, this saves time and storage space.XRouter was designed from the ground up to provide interoperability with ANY and ALL blockchains, including all DTL and private chains such as IOTA, Hashgraph, Hyperledger, and D3. There is no limit on the data XRouter can consume and verify \u2013 including any external data source in an oraclized manner. XRouter is not limited in any way, shape, or form and is compatible with all blockchains. By allowing blockchains to integrate with each other (directly chain to chain, without being a middleman to the data itself), XRouter gives people, companies, industries, and developers the ability to utilize different blockchains for any dApp they desire and decentralizes the API ecosystem.Developers can begin building dApps right now on multiple blockchains and platforms including EOS, Ethereum, Stellar, Cardano, Tron, XRP, Monero, IOTA, NEO, Vechain, NEM, Waves and many more. The possibilities of mixing and matching the functionality of different blockchains to create groundbreaking dApps are almost endless. XRouter API details can be viewed here.The Potential of Cross-blockchain DApps and Multichain ArchitecturesXRouter allows for the monetisation of inter-chain and multi-chain services.Supply ChainIn supply chain there will be multiple blockchains being used at various steps of the process much like there is today with traditional software stacks. The Blocknet Protocol and XRouter would allow information to be accessible between these different blockchains. For Example, pharmaceutical manufacturers have strict regulations to follow and need to provide certain information and assurances. Being able to access batch information from the raw materials being consumed, temperature and humidity information during transportation, and final destinations are all important. A smart contract utilizing XRouter to gather this information from each respective chain and write it to the pharmaceutical\u2019s blockchain along with the batch code. XRouter would enable this communication to occur in a trustless way, which is important to ensure validity of the information.Storage and HostingIf creating a dApp on Ethereum, you may require storage functionality. Ethereum doesn\u2019t intrinsically handle file storage very efficiently. In this scenario, XRouter can be used to interact with other blockchains such as Storj, Filecoin, Sia, or Swarm to utilize their storage services.Media and ContentFor content creation, a creator has the option of publishing to the LBRY Credits or Alexandria blockchains. Similar to HootSuite, which is a tool that allows posting to multiple social media platforms simultaneously, a dApp can be created using XRouter that offers the same benefit. The user can post their content once, whether it\u2019s audio, video, literature, or art, and have it published to Alexandria\u2019s and LBRY Credit\u2019s blockchain platform simultaneously.MarketsThere are many blockchains creating decentralized marketplaces including Origami, District0x, OpenBazaar, and Syscoin\u2019s marketplace, but the offering of products are relatively low on each independent platform. A dApp that utilizes XRouter to aggregate all the products into a single hub would offer a lot more options to users and a fuller marketplace. It can also make publishing products easier by publishing to all platforms simultaneously through a single form, offering more exposure than posting to a single marketplace while saving time.Business and IndustryThere are many dApps and blockchains that will end up using health data. Rather than submitting health data to each application, a universal EHR (Electronic Health Record) blockchain can be created to manage personal medical data and accessibility of data by each application. The health data on this EHR ledger can be shared amongst healthcare providers, hospitals, and insurance blockchains, dApps, and applications via XRouter.CertificationsCertifications and licensing records can be stored on a dedicated blockchain where they could be verified by a dApp built on the Blocknet Protocol. These records can be used to confirm qualifications and grant access or permissions.Developers wanted for the Beginning of a New EcosystemBlocknet enables the creation of a multitude of cross-chain dApps and multichain architectures only limited by developers imaginations. If you want to build for XRouter or have any questions, please join our Discord or check out our Reddit page. You can download the Blocknet wallet with XRouter here. (In the future, the Blocknet wallet will not be required).By building on the Blocknet Protocol, and joining the \u201cInternet of Blockchains,\u201d developers will help to evolve a decentralized crypto-ecosystem with a trustless security model, which has the ability to monetize tokens native to any blockchain. In addition, the Blocknet Protocol allows over 100 digital assets to be traded on Block DX, a 100% decentralized exchange dApp built on the protocol where the ability to list an asset is open and free, and your funds are in your control at all times as no third party is ever involved. Cloudchain Inc. is currently implementing a fully decentralized lite (thin) multi-wallet utilizing Blocknet\u2019s XRouter protocol.To learn more about XRouter, Block DX and Blocknet, check out Blocknet\u2019s website, API, documentation, Discord, and whitepaper.The Rundown An Internet of Blockchains (IoB)The Potential of Cross-blockchain DApps and Multichain ArchitecturesSupply ChainStorage and HostingMedia and ContentMarketsBusiness and IndustryCertificationsDevelopers wanted for the Beginning of a New Ecosystem"}

Instead, critics say the URVCBA focuses more on controlling cryptocurrency activity.The ULC model is an attempt to extend the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) to the crypto and blockchain industry. The goal is also to replace the patchwork of state laws with a more unified regulatory paradigm for businesses operating in the industry in states across the U.S.ULC Regulatory Paradigm is Anathema to CryptocurrencyWendy Stolyarov, Director of Government affairs at Filament \u2013 a blockchain hardware developer, wrote a letter in opposition to the bill back in March 2019. An excerpt of the letter reads:While our business does not rely on cryptocurrency, we are concerned that SB195 could unintentionally classify us as a money transmitter because we build hardware wallet technology that enables machine-to-machine autonomous transaction.Apart from introducing money transmitter license burden on crypto and blockchain companies, the URVCBA also cryptocurrency tokens from super-negotiability protection. This protection offers crypto buyers coverage from all unknown encumbrances.Andrea Tinianow, a UCC attorney in a Forbes article published in March highlighted that the ULC code only ensures super-negotiability for assets held under a registered third-party custodian. Meanwhile, the majority of token holders are direct owners of cryptocurrencies.In response to these criticisms, the ULC issued a statement in late March 2019 asking states to halt all legislative procedures around its URVCBA regulatory model. The ULC also said it would carry out further studies on how to create a better UCC framework for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.With states like Missouri and Wyoming rejecting the ULC model in favor of more protective laws, other states might also become wary of losing their competitive edge if they adopt the flawed URVCBA.Should Nevada lawmakers push on with Wyoming-style cryptocurrency regulations or wait for a more crypto-friendly ULC set of rules?

Bloomberg notes:The inflation rate rose to almost 55 percent in March, with consumer prices rising 4.7 percent in the month, exceeding all of the forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.The unstable economic environment is driving many traders and investors to focus on Bitcoin. Thus, the volumes of Bitcoin traded in Argentina are reaching all-time highs, the latest data from LocalBitcoins/coin.dance shows.Argentina\u2019s economy suffers from chronic inflation to such an extent that no monetary measure seems to work. According to the Financial Times,Argentina is trapped in a vicious circle. Demand of just a few million dollars in an illiquid market can weaken the peso, as has been the case since early March. Exchange rate depreciation leads quickly to increases in inflation, portfolio dollarization, and higher interest rates \u2014 now the central bank\u2019s only means of defending the currency.\u2018Replace Argentinean Pesos with Bitcoin\u2019The fact that Bitcoin is inflation-resistant makes it particularly attractive in this environment. Consequently, many see Bitcoin as a potential alternative. They are advocating, even to the government, greater integration of the cryptocurrency into Argentina\u2019s economy.Bitcoin has already become integrated into many business activities. For instance, in 37 cities, public transportation users are indirectly using Bitcoin to pay for their rides, while Bitcoin ATMs are becoming more conspicuous in Buenos Aires.Most relevant, President Mauricio Macri\u2019s administration has already shown interest in Bitcoin and, its underlying technology, blockchain. For example, in March 2019, the government announced a partnership with Binance Labs, the blockchain technology incubator of Bitcoin exchange giant Binance. At the announcement, the government promised to match 1:1 Binance investment.Moreover, in March 2019, serial investor and Bitcoin proponent Tim Draper recommended that President Macri attract foreign investors by dramatically transforming the country\u2019s economy and replace the Argentinean peso with Bitcoin.Draper even made a bet with Argentina\u2019s president on the price of Bitcoin,[I]f the peso is valued more than Bitcoin, I double the investment I am making in the country; and if Bitcoin acquires more value than the peso\u2026 that would be a perfect solution because there is no confidence in the currency.How do you think the integration of Bitcoin into Argentina\u2019s economy could help to minimize inflation?

In a podcast last week, some of the best-known figures in the Bitcoin industry added weight to the concept, with analyst Willy Woo putting the chances of Bitcoin price hitting fresh lows this year at just 5 percent. Others were almost equally bullish, including Tuur Demeester, who attributed a likelihood of 20 percent, while Murad Mahmudov and David Puell offered 25 percent and 30 percent respectively.Schwartz Sell-Off Is XRP\u2019s \u2018Most Bearish Sign\u2019For altcoin investors, however, this week has painted a decidedly bleaker picture.The sudden change in direction for Bitcoin swiftly triggered a rout across major tokens, Binance Coin 00 leading the charge with 24-hour losses exceeding 10 percent.The in-house token for Binance had become a favorite in recent days, beating its USD all-time high earlier this week as its issuer began rolling out features of its decentralized exchange platform. As Bitcoinist noted, CEO Changpeng Zhao had even called on fans not to praise the token at the expense of others, notably Ethereum, which lost closer to 5 percent over the same period. Following BNB, many coins in the top twenty by market cap shed around 8 percent of their USD value, with only Monero managing to avoid the selling pressure.Ripple\u2019s XRP token 00, the second-largest altcoin by market cap, similarly fared better than expected, amid news one of the company\u2019s senior executives had begun selling his reserves.Currently playing out over Twitter, it emerged CTO David Schwartz is divesting himself of his worth in accordance with a pre-arranged investment strategy with his wife.\u201cThe majority of our liquid assets is still XRP that I purchased on exchanges by market making,\u201d he explained Sunday. The majority of our illiquid assets is still Ripple stock.

The performance of Bitcoin in 2019, especially the significant rally in April seems to be reigniting the debate over the Bitcoin price bottom.Bitcoin is up by more than 40 percent since the start of the year. The cryptocurrency also looks to be maintaining the $5,000 price despite a few pullbacks in the past week.New ATH in 22 Years\u2019 TimeWhile the UBS research effectively reaches the same conclusions as many cryptocurrency stakeholders that Bitcoin has bottomed out, Dennean reports that BTC will not reach its ATH for another 22 years.This timeline also comes from comparing BTC to the aforementioned stock markets. According to Dennean\u2019s report:We\u2019re struck by how long it took other asset bubbles to recover their peak levels (as long as 22 years for the Dow Jones Industrials) and how pedestrian the annualized returns from trough to the recovery often are.While it is true that the peak-to-trough fall for Bitcoin is similar to those of the NASDAQ in 2000 and the Dow Jones in 1929, BTC has been there many times before.On each previous occasion, BTC has not only recovered, but also posted higher highs several orders of magnitude greater in the following years.Dennean\u2019s research seems to only compare the 2018 price crash to well-known stock market crashes. Bitcoin has already experienced five \u2018bubbles\u2019 including a 93 percent drop between June and November 2011.However, Bitcoin\u2019s rise over the past decade has been unprecedented. Nothing has ever risen as fast and as much \u2013 which makes it incomparable even to the most successful companies and innovators.Do you agree with the BTC ATH timeline given by the UBS researchers?

The same place where the country\u2019s Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire announced that the EU should adopt the French regulation on crypto assets.To a packed room, he announced that regulation was necessary \u201cto build a framework of trust.\u201d Many cryptocurrencies companies struggle to get bank accounts, he said. But identifying themselves and applying for licenses will create enough trust for banks and investors to work with them. Oh, the irony.You would think that a man who goes by the last name of \u201cO\u201d would hold Bitcoin\u2019s values of privacy dearly. Alas, Mr. O is \u201cstrongly\u201d in favor of regulation.In fact, he\u2019s already actively looking into (effectively) censoring content on social media by using some kind of \u201ccentral repository\u201d to \u201cquery\u201d specific posts.KYC/AML Have No Place in BitcoinIn a brief press conference shortly after his speech, Bitcoinist spoke to Mr. O in front of flashing cameras. We pointed out that many in the cryptocurrency space believe that KYC/AML has no place in Bitcoin. In fact, the creator\u2019s anonymity is considered to be not a bug, but a key component of its decentralization.This is an argument held not only by cypherpunks but other key members in the space such as Meltem Demirors:\"I'm Not an International Drug Dealer\" - @Melt_Dem https://t.co/6bOEXdgfyu Once everyone starts to understand what the implications of KYC/AML are, they turn against it 100%.

His reply unsurprisingly skated around the question. But he used the internet as an example. He said that it had been allowed to develop freely and that has caused many problems:There is no one ruling the internet\u2026 In the shadow of that freedom, there are some threats that are emerging\u2026 cyberwar, hate speech, fake news\u2026 they are threatening even the architecture of the internet\u2026 I think the same goes for blockchain.He added that for the blockchain industry to achieve mass adoption, it needs \u201ca little bit of transparency and regulation.\u201dThe \u201cdream\u201d of self-regulation is, according to him, exactly that. Human beings need to be monitored.I know that there is this kind of dream inside of the blockchain world. Actually, we had the same for the internet world for the past years. That it can be self-regulated and does not need any regulation. From my personal point of view, I think we have to find a balance between that organization that is at the core [\u2026] that distributed governance, and the idea that we still need a little bit of regulation and transparency.Do you agree with the French Secretary of State for Digital Affairs?

This \u2018new chapter\u2019 as the CEO Changpeng Zhao has called it, will have all the currently existing Binance Coin (BNB), which are based on the ERC20 standard, swapped to the new network on April 23rd.Moreover, Zhao has also successfully completed the first transaction on Binance Chain.\u201cThe Binance_DEX members gave me the honor to do the first transaction on Binance Chain.

According to the blog post, if everything goes as planned, users will be able to provide Binance Chain addresses for BNB withdrawal requests. It is this withdrawal that will act as a mechanism to convert the ERC20-based BNB tokens into BEP2 BNB tokens.Additionally, the management of BEP2 BNB will be managed in a way similar to that of the current ERC20 BNB. The initial supply will be 200,000,000 BNB and 11,654,398 will be burned on Binance Chain. Moreover, 48,000,000 BNB will be frozen.The very first batch of 5,000,000 BNB will be deposited into an address, which belongs to Binance in order to convert ERC20 BNB for existing owners. At the same time, Binance will burn 5,000,000 ERC20 BNB in order to keep the total supply constant.Naturally, as more users begin to convert to BEP2 BNB, more BEp2 coins will appear, while Binance will burn the proportional amounts of ERC20 BNB in order to keep the supply across both networks constant.It\u2019s also worth noting that the company said it will continue to support ERC20 BNB for the \u2018foreseeable future\u2019 but encourages users to convert them to BEP2 BNB.BNB Price Surges in ResponseBinance Coin (BNB) 00 has been performing particularly well over the past three months, gaining more than 220 percent in value.Throughout the last 24 hours alone, the cryptocurrency is up by more than 11.50 percent and is pushing to break its all-time high value of 0.00432 against BTC.Will you be trying out Binance Chain?

This means that in one day, Bitcoin achieved 11 percent of the company\u2019s annual volume.\u201cBitcoin is the killer app,\u201d he summarized, referring to a long-time debate as to whether or not BTC will become the ultimate long-term cryptocurrency phenomenon.Currently, Bitcoin has a daily transaction total of around 350,000, data from Blockchain.com shows.Real AdoptionHis comments come as Bitcoin price 00 continues to ride high above $5000 this month, a new trend which has sparked increased volumes throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In March, on-chain transactions reached a level not seen for 15 months, capping a trend which had run in contrast to previously declining prices through 2018.Regarding Bitcoin\u2019s readiness to usurp fiat incumbent market players, extensive analysis has already made bold claims about a major market shake-up coming as soon as ten years\u2019 time. As Bitcoinist reported, the figures from software startup DataLight, published earlier in April, characterized Bitcoin as already having the ability to become the world\u2019s foremost payment network. \u201cTraditional payment systems developed their companies for as many as 60 years prior to becoming industry leaders,\u201d researchers summarized. They have developed gradually, conquering region after region, unlike Bitcoin, which became available worldwide immediately. In just 10 years, Bitcoin has managed to compete with the leaders of the payment system industry.DataLight nonetheless forecast it would be off-chain solutions \u2013 specifically Lightning \u2013 which would give Bitcoin the edge in transaction capacity over rivals such as Visa and MasterCard.Those networks, at present, can handle 65,000 and 40,000 transactions per second respectively.BTC transaction data further sets it apart from altcoins this month. As Bitcoinist noted, despite Weiss Ratings championing network activity of assets such as Tezos, the actual value represented by those transactions is a fraction of that moved by the Bitcoin network. Weiss itself appeared to partially acknowledge this fact.\u201cOf course, not all transactions are qualitatively the same. A $10 million Bitcoin transfer is obviously more important than a simple vote or \u2018like\u2019 on Steem,\u201d executives summarized.In 2018, the Bitcoin network transferred over $3.2 trillion despite an 80 percent drop in price.What do you think about Bitcoin\u2019s transaction volumes?

But it is printing lower highs on the histogram, which does imply that the move overnight is running out of steam.Relatively speaking, the volume is also contracting, which would also hint that a bigger move is in the works as traders position themselves.Weekly ChartThe weekly chart clearly demonstrates that bitcoin bulls could ideally do with the weekly closing up over the $5300 level to avoid another doji indecision candle that many market participants would view as being a sign of weakness.The MACD histogram combined with the green volume and candles does a lot to demonstrate how in control the bulls have been since the yearly lows of mid-February at around $3350.More Tethers PleaseThe chart showing the market cap for USDT shows that since the 25% breakout in Bitcoin price from $4k to $5k at the start of April, the Tether market cap has also advanced 25%, or $500bn since the move: from $2bn to $2.5bn.This is quite significant on the basis that it demonstrates that new money has flown into the space after the price hike with China being a major source.The reason this is significant is that the buying interest has quickly followed price, indicating that buying interest is increasing as sharply as the price, which could provide additional momentum.5,500,100 #USDT (5,533,350 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #BinanceTx: https://t.co/XmLLPiV7aQ\u2014 Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 18, 2019This is good news for the bulls who can feel more comfortable that the noise around the price hike being in relation to one buyer was more likely bear fiction, than fact.Still a Bear MarketWhile there are very positive signs for the bulls, we must remember that bitcoin has had a stupendous run so far in 2019 and is also yet to post macro higher highs above the key $6000 resistance.Until that occurs, despite all of the positive indicators, we remain bullish within what is still a bear market until proven otherwise. A break out above $5500 in the near term will go a long way to making that change a very real possibility in 2019.Trade Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

In fact, it\u2019s the \u201cmost interesting property in the world,\u201d writes General Partner at Blockchain Capital, Spencer Bogart.Looking closer, many similarities do exist between Bitcoin and real estate. Moreover, Bitcoin introduces some unique advantages that will surely come in handy in an increasingly digital world. Bogarts explains that Bitcoin is a technology that \u201cblurs the boundary\u201d between personal property and real property because the distinction is arbitrary to begin with.It\u2019s Absolutely ScarceFirst and foremost, Bitcoin is scarce just like physical property. But it\u2019s unitization into a total of 21 million pieces or bitcoins plot of land fungible. \u201cFortunately, there\u2019s no need to compare the pieces: Every piece of this property is the same as every other piece \u2014 they\u2019re fungible,\u201d explains Bogart. Additionally, Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity is mathematically verifiable. In other words, Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity is absolute. It\u2019s even more absolute than physical territory that can be geologically formed over time, reclaimed, or colonized (in space) in the future etc.What\u2019s more, this scarcity will become even more palpable with time. Block reward halvings will continue reducing emission asymptotically until 2140. Meanwhile, over 75 percent of all bitcoin have already been mined. While over 4 million are now estimated to be lost.You Don\u2019t Need Guns or a WallBitcoin introduces other unique attributes that weren\u2019t possible before. Unlike physical real estate, it is both portable and borderless. It also doesn\u2019t require walls or fences to secure. Safekeeping your bitcoins is much easier and cheaper. A hardware wallet typically costs around $100 bucks on which you can store limitless amounts of value. And the best part is that no one has to know it. \u201cIt\u2019s discrete\u2026nobody would even necessarily know if you were carrying it,\u201d says Bogart. I want to be able to own something that is considered valuable to the world, and not have anyone know about it. #mydataMyLife @matt_odell\u2014 Brennan (@BrennanGeis) April 18, 2019It Can Be Moved Around the Globe in MinutesDigital real estate means your property is now portable in the age of computers. While fungibility makes it alot more liquid than traditional real estate. It\u2019s no coincidence that so many exchanges have sprung up enabling people to trade bitcoin with anyone around the globe in minutes.Bogart notes:While it typically costs 8\u201320% in transaction expenses and months of time to finalize real property transactions, units of this particular property can be transacted for a fraction of 1% \u2014 and can be completed in minutes.It\u2019s Programmable, Non-Discriminatory, Un-SeizableThis \u2018digital real estate\u2019 is also programmable empowering the owner to set who can access or use it and for how long. This brings a slew of benefits and new possibilities (e.g. multi-sig digital contracts) including being-your-own-bank capabilities. The \u2018digital territory\u2019 is also non-discriminatory by following one simple rule: the owner of the private key controls the property.In other words, no one can take your digital plot of land from you unless you allow them to. This is nothing short of a breakthrough for objective property rights, undermining dependence on courts and governments.Bogart notes:It offers strong assurances for objective property rights, impersonal rules and consistent enforcement of these clearly defined rules.It\u2019s Quickly Developing and Growing in ValueThe aforementioned traits make Bitcoin prime real estate for economic development. In a world that is becoming increasingly digital, the emergence of Bitcoin as \u2018digital real estate\u2019 may not only be necessary, but also inevitable.Programmability, portability, security, fungibility, and network effect, in particular, are distinguishing Bitcoin as the focal point for trustlessly transferring value in the digital age.And just like land along with its natural resources that can be developed to increase its value, Bitcoin is already demostrating tremendous economic growth and growing in price. Bogart concludes: [T]his property is surrounded by economic growth in the form of rapidly expanding and improving infrastructure. Other people are building the bridges, tunnels, and railways that, hopefully, make your property more useful.Should investors consider Bitcoin as \u2018digital property\u2019?

Let\u2019s look at some recent strong performers that are already having a breakout year and set to test new all-time highs.Binance Coin (BNB)Binance Coin 00 is undoubtedly amongst the best performing cryptocurrencies throughout the entire 2019. Throughout the past three months, it has more than tripled in value, marking an impressive increase upwards of 222 percent against the USD.Against Bitcoin (BTC), on the other hand, the cryptocurrrency has recently hit its all-time high (ATH) on April 1st trading at 0.00432BTC. Despite experiencing a slight decline when trading against BTC since then, BNB is currently looking strong at 0.00039BTC, marking an increase upwards of 6 percent throughout the last 24 hours.Binance recently completed its 7th scheduled quarterly burn, taking out 829,888 BNB out of the market.Litecoin (LTC)Litecoin 00 is another well-performing altcoin throughout 2019. Over the past three months LTC increased by 160 percent against the dollar.Against BTC, Litecoin has managed to increase by around 87 percent.Interestingly enough, the cryptocurrency managed to gain a lot of its current value prior to Bitcoin\u2019s latest rally as it sometimes acts as a bellwether for BTC price rallies.Litecoin has also managed to retain a lot of the gains. Throughout the past week, LTC is marking a slight increase of about 4 percent against the dollar while trading flat against BTC.Basic Attention Token (BAT)Basic Attention Token (BAT) 00 is one of today\u2019s top performers, increasing by more than 8 percent against the dollar at the time of this writing.When trading against BTC, however, it marks a slightly larger increase of around 10 percent. It\u2019s worth noting that the cryptocurrency\u2019s current performance looks to test its all time high value against Bitcoin set in June 2017. Back then, it was only 38 percent higher than its current price.Over the past three months, BAT has increased by 190 percent against the USD and by 95 percent against BTC.Tezos (XTZ)Tezos 00 has marked an impressive increase of 200 percent against the USD throughout the last three months. Again, most of it was made before the Bitcoin rally in early April.Not only has Tezos managed to retain these gains, but it is also marching further. In the past week, XTZ gained 37 percent, while being 6 percent up on the day.Things are looking good for Tezos when looking at it performance against BTC as well. On the three month chart, the cryptocurrency has increased by 118 percent.Cryptocurrency Market May Have Already BottomedSo is \u2018altseason\u2018 back on? These aren\u2019t 2017-type gains just yet. However, there is increasing evidence that investors are starting to come back as several bottom indicators have surfaced.

In this phase, the researchers expect range-bound trading to characterize the BTC price action.An excerpt from the summary introduction in the report reads:During this accumulation phase, we expect for Bitcoin to trade in a range of $3,000 to $6,500 until the new bull market permanently cements the denarian cryptocurrency as a multi-trillion-dollar asset class.According to the researchers, range-bound price action which is a hallmark of an accumulation phase signifies weaker hands trying to take profits at the higher price range and the stronger, more committed traders buying the bottom range in expectation of the coming price boom.Going by previous accumulation cycles, BTC will trade sideways during this period. However, there is no consensus on the length of this present accumulation phase.In the previous boom-bust cycle for Bitcoin between 2013 and 2016, the accumulation period lasted from February 2015 to May 2016. During that period, the BTC price 00 remained constrained between $200 and $400.Shrinking Volatility \u2013 A Sign of Bitcoin Bottoming OutIf Bitcoin is in or approaching an accumulation phase, then the cryptocurrency must either have set or is close to setting a long-term price bottom. According to the report, the shrinking BTC volatility points to such a possibility.The 60-day volatility for BTC/USD is currently below five percent. Apart from early November 2018 when it fell under two percent, this current level is the lowest in almost three years.Commenting on the implications of the shrinking BTC volatility, the report states that long-term investors are beginning to dominate the market, rather than retail traders with short-term price targets.Several analysts and commentators have also expressed similar opinions recently. Tom Lee of Fundstrat has said that many of the \u201cold whales\u201d are back and are accumulating Bitcoin.Bitcoin Market Will be Worth Trillions of DollarsApart from signaling price bottoms, Tuur Demeester and Michiel Lescrauwaet of Adamant Capital believe the reduction in BTC volatility points towards greater global adoption.According to the report, Bitcoin\u2019s historical price action appears to be moving towards \u201cshallow cycles and lower volatility\u201d in place of \u201csteep cycles and high volatility.\u201dAs for over 84 percent decline in 2018, the researchers say it is a direct consequence of the 2017 bull run built on hype and market mania.The report also predicts that Bitcoin will eventually become a multi-trillion-dollar market like gold which has a market capitalization of about $8 trillion, saying:As Bitcoin matures into a globally traded commodity, it seems reasonable to expect its cycles to continue lengthening until eventually, they are on par with multi-decade cycles visible in commodities like copper or gold.How long do you think the accumulation phase will last?

But lawmakers are slowly realizing the futility of regulating Bitcoin and cryptocurrency that are un-regulatable by design. Russia\u2019s \u2018Digital Assets\u2019 Bill Would Legalize ICOsEarlier this week, Russia\u2019s Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev shared his thoughts on the country\u2019s developing cryptocurrency laws. Speaking on the sidelines at the Economic Forum in Yalta, the Minister says the main aim of the proposed \u2018digital assets\u2019 law is to legalize ICOs.He added that he expects the bill to be reviewed by the Duma in May.He said:As I understand, the aim of the proposed law is ICO legalisation. I believe the main goal is to make the ICO\u2014which is a very easy way to raise some capital\u2014convenient for small tech businesses.The minister also noted that that the topic of anonymity and anonymizing cryptocurrencies (such as Monero etc.) have come up during discussions of the draft law. \u201cTo be honest, I thought anonymity and cryptocurrencies were a thing of the past,\u201d said Moiseev. But I attended two roundtables at the Gaidar forum and there they said that these secret platforms do exist and can provide full anonymity.Worth nothing, the latest version of the proposed law removed the definitions of cryptocurrency, tokens and mining. Instead, they are now all referred to in the bill under the general definition of \u2018digital assets\u2019 and their related operations.Paved With Good IntentionsBut the proposed law is already under heavy criticism. For example, president of the Russian crypto industry and blockchain association, Yuriy Pripachkin, believes that it would only add government pressure on the cryptocurrency industry. In result, the new law would force crypto startups to move to friendlier jurisdictions such as Malta or Switzerland. If this law passes, then Russia\u2019s central bank will have the sole power to decide which digital assets can be bought by unaccredited investors.At the same time, the borderless nature of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general poses a real problem for lawmakers who are powerless outside of their jurisdiction. Roman Khoroshev, founder of a Russian crypto crowdlending platform, notes: Undoubtedly, the central bank and lawmakers have good intentions in imposing restriction on unaccredited investors. It is usually their money that typically ends up in the hands of scammers. But the problem is in controlling this process. It\u2019s almost impossible to track as the bill only proposes to regulate the cryptocurrency market within the Russian jurisdiction.Only for the Accredited RichMeanwhile, a different proposed law being reviewed by the Duma expands the unaccredited investor definition to any individual. To become accredited, an individual must be in possession of assets valued at over 10 million rubles ($150,000 USD). The maximum amount that unqualified investors could purchase will be 600,000 rubles ($10,000). In other words, not only would the Russian economy not benefit from the rapidly growing cryptocurrency industry, it would also restrict the number of potential investors and all but guarantee the failure of its approved ICOs. Russia Trying to Regulate the Un-RegulatableExperts also warn that restrictions on buying digital assets by unaccredited investors will lead to enforcement issues. Indeed, the main building blocks of cryptocurrency are that they\u2019re borderless, apolitical and decentralized. Therefore, Russian lawmakers are slowly finding out just how impossible it is to regulate something that is un-regulatable by design. Case in point: Russia\u2019s ministry of telecommunication failed miserably at trying to shut down Telegram, a centralized company. Amusingly, lawmakers themselves continued using the messaging app despite the ban.Attempting to put the brakes on decentralized cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, will make the government look even more impotent. Especially as the same government officials are reportedly quietly buying up bitcoin by the billions.In other words, the law will lack teeth while introducing a crippling Russian iteration of a \u2018BitLicense\u2018 nation-wide, which \u201cwill have nothing to do with the original idea of Bitcoin and blockchain,\u201d according to Khoroshev.Should countries attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies or embrace them as is?

This would also enable authorities to better track goods\u2019 provenance, and help combat the trafficking of counterfeit or illegal goods.Digitizing The Paper TrailCarter was speaking during a panel discussion at the Blockchain Global Revolution Conference. Moving a package internationally requires an awful lot of documentation, he explained, some of which can be as important as the package itself.While this was traditionally paper-based, even digitized documentation transfers occur via 60-year-old technology, with no real-time data. The industry-wide adoption of a standardized blockchain could provide a global solution, and a level playing field, away from proprietary systems. Said Carter:We\u2019re not an organization that pushes for more regulatory control, but there are times regulatory mandates and pushes can be incredibly helpful.Working Together To Define StandardsFedEx has joined forces with competitors, UPS and DHL Express (all members of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance), to hammer out standards for such a system. Currently, though a company like UPS can manage single supply chain transactions, these break down when dealing with real-world scenarios with multiple shippers.A company may use DHL to ship components to Germany. The assembled part may then ship to Latin America via UPS before the fitted part travels to Japan via FedEx. A standardized blockchain would enable all of the relevant information to be shared between all parties and different national authorities.Stemming Flow Of Counterfeit, Dangerous, and Illegal GoodsJust this month, the White House highlighted the need to combat trade in counterfeit goods, estimated to have a value of half a trillion dollars annually. Using a permissioned blockchain would create a permanent ledger, and the additional use of IoT sensors and RFID tags could give real-time feedback on transit conditions.All authorized entities, from shippers to government agencies, to customers, could track packages, potentially all the way back up the supply chain.FedEx Logistics CEO, Richard Smith, explained that the government\u2019s concern with this was that blockchain had not been widely adopted. His response to which was:You\u2019re the government. You can mandate that it\u2019s widely adopted.Gov\u2019t To Mandate Industry-wide Blockchain Adoption?FedEx believes that this is the quickest way to modernize and streamline the industry, meeting customers\u2019 increasingly complex cross-border shipping, transportation, and brokerage needs. Additionally, it would provide a way to help customs and border agents to achieve their goals, regarding illicit goods flow.Shipping has long been one of the industries with high hopes for the introduction of blockchain based solutions. A standardized and mandated system could see one of the first cases of mainstream adoption.Will FedEx be one of the first shipping giants to successfully use blockchain tech?

Different countries still view cryptocurrencies and blockchain quite differently and finding the right location to capture the most investors is tricky.ICOs have been an undoubtedly positive force for blockchain, giving exposure and capital to projects that have pushed the industry forward. Even so, they have been known to have issues with transparency and security, putting them at odds with regulators.However, crypto exchanges are improving on the original model with the initial exchange offering (IEO). By managing the token sales for projects, exchanges provide greater compliance, and give investors trust that projects are likelier to succeed thanks to extensive due diligence. With more exchanges joining the growing trend, IEOs may be a major influence for crypto adoption.Exchanges Pave The Way Ahead With IEOsIn typical blockchain fashion, IEOs are a largely bootstrapped yet functional way to add transparency to the original ICO model. A cryptocurrency exchange shoulders responsibility for vaulting all obstacles in the way of young blockchain projects. Regulations are just one aspect of this battle, as independent ICOs must carefully monitor their marketing language and advertising (the expectation of profit might alter a token\u2019s asset classification). Additionally, they must create and manage an issuing smart contract, host the crowd sale successfully, identify destinations for listing the new token, and then finally manage their growing economy while pushing past technology milestones.As changing trends make this process more difficult to undertake successfully, exchanges have leveraged their role as the primary beneficiary of crypto\u2019s bull markets to use their capital and extensive reach to upgrade the fundraising model. IEOs issue tokens directly to a captive audience (exchange members) using their own user wallets and list the token on the exchange itself for instant liquidity. They also deploy exchange resources to help projects finish their unique compliance checklist for wherever they intend to launch, leaving young blockchain entities to focus exclusively on their solution.New Entrants Help IEO Market ExpandThe IEO concept was first pioneered by Binance\u2019s Launchpad, which offered a more cost-effective platform for blockchain projects. In the time since, several other major exchanges have launched their own IEO platforms, including Bittrex and Huobi.The newest entrant to the game, BitForex, is quickly catching up with some intriguing IEOs on the docket. The exchange\u2019s Turbo platform has already launched four IEOs and is set to release its fifth with events marketplace Evedo.The company\u2019s EVED coin unlocks a central hub for the various stakeholders in event planning\u2014promoters, talent, caterers, suppliers, events, and sponsors\u2014to find each other and collaborate seamlessly without intermediaries. Evedo has already launched an alpha version and is gaining traction locally in its home country of Bulgaria.BitForex has also recently launched successful IEOs for Adab, the First Islamic Crypto Exchange (FICE), as well as blockchain investment banking platform Azbit, with both showing promise in the early IEO stages. Outside of BitForex, some of the most successful launches so far include BitTorrent Token and Kamari, both of which surpassed $7 million in funds raised.A New Direction For Blockchain CapitalizationEven though the regulatory market is still taking shape across the globe, IEOs offer a glimpse into how blockchain can advance its path towards greater compliance and transparency. While ICOs provided the sector the independence it craved from traditional venture capital and lack of control, they left some questions unanswered.The biggest advantage exchanges can deliver to both investors and traders is their reputation and existing regulatory frameworks. Because they depend on their name and image, crypto exchanges are likely to back projects with bigger chances of success while meeting more stringent regulatory and compliance standards.There are already an impressive number of IEOs in various states of progress, but it\u2019s clear that this is definitely a new trend to keep an eye on. As blockchain finds new ways to add legitimacy and transparency to projects and capital raising, it\u2019s also likelier to find greater mainstream respect and adoption.Most importantly, IEOs reflect a conscious effort by an industry that has largely fought against regulation in the past to finally accept that it must meet regulators halfway to ensure its longevity. As more exchanges come around, IEOs could become the key way for retail investors to safely back promising projects and participate in the blockchain sector with greater assurances.The Rundown Exchanges Pave The Way Ahead With IEOsNew Entrants Help IEO Market ExpandA New Direction For Blockchain Capitalization"}

Lightning Hosted, Lightning PaidGetting started with Lightning hosted is simple: upload a popular image you think will gain traffic and receive the ad revenue for it later. Some popular choices on the network so far include memes, public domain photography, and images of funny or popular tweets and Facebook posts.There are, however, limits to what you can and cannot upload. For example, copyrighted photos, pornography, violence etc. are all banned.Taken from the founder\u2019s own words:As a rule of thumb if it wouldn\u2019t be acceptable on a California beach it\u2019s not acceptable here.Pay in Bitcoin LightningBefore you can upload an image, you\u2019ll be asked to pay a small fee to cover the site\u2019s costs and to prevent abuse of the service. Payment can only be made in Bitcoin Lightning.After you upload your desired image, you\u2019ll then be presented with a QR code and corresponding lightning address to make the deposit.After you\u2019ve paid your fee, you\u2019ll then receive a unique URL with your image link that contains advertisements.Satoshis will start to accumulate in your account and can be withdrawn at any time. But as the website is in beta, the founder claims that the Satoshi amount will not always be accurate. Also, withdrawals will be delayed until the platform is paid by its advertisers.But Don\u2019t Be Too #RecklessYou can easily start sending and receiving by using one of the currently available mobile wallets that support Lightning. Though we do not recommend to yet store a significant amount of funds on custodial wallets, in particular.This is because Lightning Network is still bleeding edge technology and using it can be quite #reckless.The Lightning Hosted service is currently in beta so the service will undoubtedly have a few bugs.

Cryptocurrency Hedge Funds Are Growing the FastestA few months ago, Wall Street seemed to be embracing Bitcoin, and giants such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were developing infrastructures to trade Bitcoin. But then, after the value of digital coins collapsed last year, Wall Street top bosses got cold feet and shelved their projects.Now, 2019 Bitcoin economic activity is hitting fresh highs and its value is rebounding. However, Wall Street is not reacting to seize the opportunity. The Street writes,Yet giant U.S. banks like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group and Bank of New York Mellon that dominate Wall Street trading in everything from bonds, stocks, commodities, and foreign exchanges are increasingly at risk of missing out due to their own reluctance to jump into the cryptocurrency market.Wall Street executives\u2019 excuses abound, ranging from lack of federal regulations to the potential of nefarious activities executed using cryptocurrencies.Another Wall Street concern is regulators\u2019 inertia. Several key initiatives that would help to trigger an explosive expansion of the crypto market have yet to receive regulatory approval.Nevertheless, investors continue to inject money into the crypto market. Thus, spite the 2018 crypto winter, worldwide, the rate at which new crypto-related funds were launched increased. The Crypto Fund Research underlines, \u201cWe are on pace for a record 200+ new launches for 2018, including crypto hedge funds, crypto venture funds, and crypto private equity.\u201dGranted, financial instruments focusing on the nascent crypto assets market are still small. \u201cAll crypto funds combined make up less than 1% of total hedge fund assets,\u201d according to a Crypto Fund Research report, which specifies,There are currently more than 700 cryptocurrency/blockchain investment funds. The majority are set up as hedge venture capital funds, while a large number are hedge funds or hybrid funds. There are also a handful of crypto ETFs and crypto private equity funds.The United States is the country were most crypto funds have been launched. However, the launching of new crypto funds is also increasingly occurring in Europe, Asia, offshore (Cayman Islands), and Mexico. See the comprehensive list of crypto fund launches here.The Crypto Fund Research report concludes,Crypto hedge funds are the fastest growing segment of the hedge fund industry.Moreover, crypto assets under management continue to grow, as the graph below shows:Bitcoin-Based Startups Are Springing UpOn the other hand, smaller but visionary companies continue creating new Bitcoin-related solutions. For instance, Coinbase is now launching a solution that offers financial investors the opportunity to earn interest on specific cryptocurrencies they hold.Additionally, Square is searching for talent to staff teams that will work on the crypto space. To attract candidates, Square offers to pay developers and crypto engineers in bitcoin.Moreover, help to increase the growth of the overall crypto market might indirectly come from social media giant Facebook. In effect, Facebook is reportedly planning to use cryptocurrency technology to transfer money via Whatsapp.Ross Sandler, an internet analyst at Barclays, Facebook believes Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency \u201ccould be part of a multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity. According to CNBC,Sandler forecasted as much as $19 billion in additional revenue by 2021 from \u2018Facebook Coin.\u2019 Conservatively, the firm sees a base-case of an incremental $3 billion in revenue from a successful cryptocurrency implementation.What do you think about Wall Street\u2019s inertia towards the crypto industry?

Nearly $1 billion has already been collected by four organizations responsible for the restoration of the Roman Catholic church, including from some of the world\u2019s richest people and organizations.Now it seems that even the crypto community is getting involved in the effort. Though the amounts collected so far are merely symbolic (0.23049983 BTC as of this writing), the idea is that global money should be easily allocated to raise capital and this is a prime use case for that.France\u2019s Minister for the Digital Economy, Cedric O, has been very bullish on blockchain so far and is extremely open to the idea\u2026.In some countries, this sort of effort would be near impossible but at the moment France is demonstrating that they are a clear leader of mainstream crypto adoption in the European Union.Mr. O\u2019s keynote speech was one of the highlights of the ongoing blockchain week in Paris, second of course to Yoni Assia\u2019s keynote that we highlighted yesterday and this awesome panel discussion (timestamp: 9:15) about how digital assets are integrating into the current financial system.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystDue to local holidays, there will be no market update tomorrow or Monday. We will resume on Tuesday, April 23rd.Today\u2019s HighlightsLong Weekend AheadThree Black Spy CrowsLooking at Aug-2 SurgePlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of April 18th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsTrading is likely to be a bit wonky for the next few days. Tomorrow is Good Friday and Monday is Easter Monday, with the Jewish Holiday of Passover beginning tomorrow. Many investors and traders especially in Europe, Canada, and Australia will be out for a long weekend.The world\u2019s two largest economies, USA and China, will be operating at full capacity as they work towards a possible trade deal, in the hopes it will be agreed and signed in the coming months.Three Black Spy CrowsAn interesting pattern has emerged on one of the charts that I think is worth highlighting. For those not familiar, the SPY is the largest ETF in the world and is designed to track the S&P 500. Needless to say, it\u2019s pretty popular among traders and analysts looking to get a handle on the markets.Here\u2019s the chart, with each candlestick set to one day. Take a look at those last three candles.Even though they\u2019re clearly red, this pattern is known often referred to as the three black crows and it usually represents a bearish turn in sentiment.What\u2019s interesting about the above graph is that even though all the last three candles are red, the opening price of each day has been higher than the previous one. So it seems that traders are clearly looking for a lower price, but the indices are being brought up after hours.Just for fun, let\u2019s go one step deeper here. This graph shows the SPY in candlesticks, and overlayed is the S&P 500, which it tracks in green. The S&P 500 actually trades 23 hours a day, while the SPY only trades during the US market open hours. So we can see a bit better how this behavior is playing out.Crypto ConsolidationCrypto markets continue to consolidate the gains accumulated on April 2nd and the aftermath of that surge. By now, volatility and volumes have come down again and seem to be returning to their pre-April Fools day levels. As we said before, this sort of stabilization is quite positive at this point.So, now should be a good time to take a closer look at what actually caused that massive surge in the first place.An interesting report from TradeBlock takes a deep dive into the order books across the top exchanges at the exact time of the surge. Here is one of the key graphs, which shows that volumes were highest on Bitfinex, Coinbase Pro, and Kraken.The report refutes the claim that the surge was allegedly caused by a massive order that was coordinated on Bitstamp, Kraken, and Coinbase, saying that Bitstamp had nothing to do with it.Still, to me, the narrative that this was about one large buyer was less about which exchanges exactly were involved and more about how many people were involved in moving the market. In addition, while a good insightful read, the report leaves a lot to be desired as it only examines exchanges that are available in the United States and, as we previously mentioned, the April 2nd surge clearly happened during the Asian trading session.So we\u2019re really no closer to finding out what exactly happened there. My opinion remains that this was a technical move caused by the break of the psychological resistance at $4,200, regardless of how many players were involved.Another report came out yesterday that I thought was interesting. This one from Cryptocompare.com, which analyses the industry on a monthly basis.Figure 6 shows the distribution of volume between crypto-to-crypto and fiat-to-crypto exchanges.I thought this was interesting given that March was the height of altseason. Still, looking for a better view of this trend, the good folks at cryptocompare were kind enough to send me the following graph which shows the same stats since the start of 2017.From the looks of it, the trend is pretty clear. Overall volumes are indeed growing but the percentage of volumes that are coming from fiat into crypto is shrinking over time.It will be interesting to see how these numbers come out for April as that could give us a bit more insight into the April Fools surge.Wishing everyone an amazing holiday and a wonderful weekend.Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalysteToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

At the same time, diversifying has not been the most successful strategy when it comes to reducing risk based on historical market performance. XRP \u2018Best Diversifying\u2019Binance Research released a report this past week detailing the correlation between types of cryptocurrencies.It concludes that the largest cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibited the highest positive correlations or \u201cclusters.\u201d This positive correlation means that the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum tend to follow the same market trends. As the prices tend to move together, investors are then exposed to similar gains and risks.Ripple, on the other hand, showed less of a correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s trends and was named \u201cthe best diversifier among digital assets with a market cap above $3 billion\u201d in the report.Previous reports on the risks of diversifying cryptocurrencies, however, suggest that spreading risk across altcoins, XRP included, might not be the safest strategy given Bitcoin\u2019s typical market behavior.The Binance study, meanwhile, also noted other findings in the relationship between various cryptocurrencies.A single cluster was found for the following assets:Bitcoin GoldBitcoin CashEthereum ClassicLitecoinWhile other coins exhibited price action from being (or not being) listed on specific exchanges: namely the \u201cBinance effect\u201d and the \u201cCoinbase listing effect.\u201dFor example, Tezos and Dogecoin, two assets not listed on Binance, each formed their own individual \u201cchild\u201d clusters. While for Coinbase, some assets were listed by the company also formed similar cluster groups (e.g. XLM).ClustersThe Binance researchers focused on the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap and their USD-equivalent prices were also taken from CoinMarketCap. Though \u2018real\u2019 cryptocurrency volumes should have also been taken into consideration.Stablecoins were excluded from the study along with any virtual asset that was backed by other assets \u201cwhether they were digital or physical.\u201dA 30-day rolling average for market caps was used and the 30 \u201cnon-backed\u201d largest assets were selected for the research. The date range covered the period between March 31st, 2018 and March 31st, 2019.The figure below represents the weekly return correlation matrix.A final set of clusters were also found. The study uncovered that certain \u201cprivacy coins\u201d like Dash and Monero formed a single cluster.However, in an effort to avoid drawing absolute conclusions, the report came with a disclaimer, stating:On the other hand, performing K-Means clustering on risk-return profiles of each cryptoasset did not return any meaningful results. One potential explanation is that return & volatility profiles are not related to underlying price co-movements over the study period.The Binance team noted that since its previous report, the overall correlation across the cryptocurrency market has increased,\u201d which may be due to the rise of stablecoin volume, and the corresponding increase in pair offerings, in all crypto asset markets,\u201d the report said.Earlier this week, Bitcoinist, reported that Bitcoin has pushed the Bitcoin Dominance Index to new highs in 2019 against alts, though \u2018real\u2019 indices put this figure over 80 percent.[Disclaimer: The information contained in this article is intended for educational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice.

But compare that to the savage landscape of altcoins in which one token can gain or lose 75 percent of its value in less than 60 minutes. That\u2019s what happened to Digitex Futures yesterday\u2013and it had to hurt.Why Did Digitex Futures (DGTX) Fall Off a Cliff?For an altcoin (or possibly sh**coin, the market is still trying to decide), the Digitex Futures community is stronger and more active than most. There aren\u2019t many projects with 1.5 million on their waitlist or a 70K+ Telegram group.You have to admire the company for its impressive work as far as viral marketing is concerned. But marketing has always been a double-edged sword for this ambitious startup with pretensions of going head to head with BitMEX.Yesterday, everything was going well as its community geared up for the April 30 launch\u2013until all of a sudden, it was \u201cpostponed until further notice.\u201d CEO Adam Todd released a video showcasing the \u201cpiece of garbage,\u201d riddled with critical flaws, that was the final build received from Spotware, Digitex\u2019s development partner, whom he slated for their incompetence.Visibly furious, he fumed:What they\u2019ve delivered here is not the Digitex Futures exchange. This is not the BitMEX killer. The only way this would be the BitMEX killer is if Arthur looks at this and f**king dies laughing.Within minutes of the news of the delayed launch, its DGTX token 00 tanked by over 70 percent, landing a place as the biggest loser of the day.Fool Me Once Shame on You, Fool Me Twice\u2026However that saying goes, Digitex has weathered previous storms. The altcoin that has undergone marketing on steroids saw a previous tank after missing its first deadline for the Beta version in January.The community reacted in a similar way then, albeit slightly less savagely the first time around. The token dipped to a low of around 3 cents before picking back up to as high as 14 cents during the second week of April.According to Todd, missing that deadline made him realize that development was going too slowly and the community was getting restless. So, he decided to part ways with his Dublin developers and outsource the final build to experts in the exchange software market, who guaranteed delivery of a robust working exchange that could be released to the public on April 30.In his video, he explains that he knew that there were bugs but was assured that they were being fixed. However, just days before the launch, he was informed that the reported bugs were in fact \u201cexpected behavior\u201d (i.e. non-fixable). The final build had no trading volume, no ability to adjust leverage, didn\u2019t display spot price of the underlying instrument, did not allow the trader to exit a position, and charged commissions (on a zero-fee exchange). In short?What the f**k do I do with this? We\u2019ve been delivered this piece of garbage that doesn\u2019t even work. It doesn\u2019t work.Where Does Digitex Go From Here?The company is getting used to managing mismanagement. That\u2019s hardly a point in its favor. But what still shines through clearly is the fact that this project continues to be something that people want (at least 1.5 million).Like many blockchain projects, this latest PR nightmare shows a green and inexperienced team when it comes to managing development timelines. It also highlights the perils of overhyping the launch of your product when you\u2019re depending on the promise of a development team to get it right. As Blockstream CEO and hash cash inventor Adam Back points out, focusing on marketing rather than tech can be problematic.I think the mistake forks focussing on marketing rather than tech, and doing it on a different token rather than on Bitcoin (eg as a side-chain, or other simple layer2). At the time I offered @rogerkver free architecture advice, FOSS & secure hardware at cost to make it happen.\u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) April 27, 2019Todd tells angry viewers that he will not stop until he gets this right. That he is setting up a new team and already has a lead developer in Serbia, and that he is going to personally oversee development as an \u201cunyielding motherf**ker\u201d of a boss until it\u2019s done.Despite the understandable barrage of abuse and outpour of rage on the company\u2019s socials, there were also voices of support.Channel that fucking rage Adam! \ud83d\ude09As someone experienced in the software development world I can understand what happened here.I might be part of a minority group, but you still have my support and faith that you will deliver on your vision \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\u2014 \ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69 \ud83d\ude80 (@CryptoToit) April 26, 2019Killing BitMEX may be a long way out of reach at the moment. Fighting for survival is now top of the new to-do list. It\u2019s hard to tell right now whether Digitex will be one of the industry\u2019s biggest ever comeback kids or just another footnote in the list of failed projects.Will Digitex develop its product to compete with BitMEX?

The Attraction Of Proof-Of-Stake Is A FallacyBitGo and Beluga co-founder, Ben Davenport, has just published a report examining the effect of taxes on PoS tokens. He makes stark conclusions regarding the taxman\u2019s impact on potential returns from the coins.One of the key attractions to PoS coins is the opportunity to stake your holdings and earn an annual reward of between 4 and 15%. But as Davenport writes, there is only one place that this money can come from: people who don\u2019t stake their coins.So if you hold one of these coins, it is in your best interests to stake. Otherwise, your share will get constantly diluted. Of course, if all holders stake all the coins, then everyone maintains the same overall share. Therefore, with PoS, you have to work/stake your coins, just to break even.But The Taxman Makes It Even WorseDespite needing to get the staking rewards simply to not lose out financially, many tax agencies still consider any yield as income. One could debate whether these are taxable, or are simply analogous to stock dividends on shareholdings. However, the fundamental difference goes back to the rewards only being paid for staking, meaning that work is being done to receive them.So you have to stake to receive the rewards, just to break even, and then the taxman will take extra money off you for the pleasure\u2026 in cash!It\u2019s got to be a pretty amazing coin to be worth that. And of course, you wouldn\u2019t dream of not declaring taxes.How Bad Can It Be?Davenport outlines an interesting thought experiment, pondering the consequences of the tax authority accepting payment in the PoS coin.It assumed a 10% annual return, 35% tax rate, and that all holders are staking 100% of their coins. It also assumed that the tax authority was a committed holder, who never sells.The tax authority share continues to increase, and after 22 years, it owns over half of the market cap.Of course, in reality, the tax authority doesn\u2019t accept the token as payment, so holders need to find new buyers, leading to downward pressure on price.So when tax is considered, proof-of-stake coins can actually lead to negative returns in real terms.Do you agree with the findings on PoS coin returns?

This is the highest recorded volume since 2016.It\u2019s speculated that the surge in interest of bitcoin was due to the seizure of the sea-faring couple, which consequently boosted awareness of Bitcoin in the country.Thai Navy Removes Seastead HomeAfter fleeing their tiny home from the coast of Thailand, the couple now remains in hiding over fears of being executed. The maximum penalty for violating Thailand\u2019s sovereignty is the death penalty.The Thai Navy is apparently looking for ways to tow the cabin back to the shoreline to be used as evidence against the couple of international \u201cseasteaders.\u201d The home was the first of its kind, built by a libertarian group named Ocean Builders who build homes and communities beyond the nation\u2019s borders.The Thai navy said that the couple wanted to \u201cestablish a permanent settlement at sea beyond the sovereignty of nations by using a legal loophole.

Bitfinex refuted the claims as \u2018riddled with false assertions\u2019, but the damage had already been done.Traders pulled $165 million out of the exchange in just 12 hours.

Bitcoinist | Apr 27, 2019 | 18:00 Share Tweet Send Share Some websites have begun offering Bitcoin lotteries. If you\u2019re thinking about trying your luck with them, here are some things to know first.The Legality Varies Based on Where You LiveBitcoin is still largely unregulated. However, many countries started setting rules to regulate Bitcoin gambling, including lotteries. It\u2019s smart to see what the laws in your country are before getting started.Look for Bitcoin Lotteries Offered By Regulated Gambling SitesPrior to entering a Bitcoin lottery, read the website\u2019s fine print and determine whether you\u2019re dealing with a regulated provider. If so, that means the site must follow the gambling regulations of the respective company, and it might give you some recourse if something goes wrong when attempting to collect winnings. One of the questions most often on people\u2019s minds is whether Bitcoin lotteries are legitimate. You\u2019ll have better luck finding a regulated one if you look for regulated providers. Keep in mind, though, that many Bitcoin gambling sites get regulated in Cura\u00e7ao, a place with looser regulations than many other nations. A Bitcoin lottery site called Kibo Lotto took that approach in late 2018. Crypto-Games.net also operates a lottery site that appears to have ties to Cura\u00e7ao based on a logo in the site\u2019s footer, as does Bitplay Club. One potential advantage to Bitplay Club is that it promises \u201cprovably fair\u201d games through algorithms that show transparency.There are also sites, like Yet Another Bitcoin Lottery (YABTCL) with no indication of regulation. Playing there arguably raises the risks.Most Bitcoin Lotto Games Have Familiar InstructionsIn states that have traditional lottery programs, such as Virginia, it\u2019s easy to find databases that give people the information they need to know to start playing. For example, Virginian adults can play daily lotto games, as well as jackpot games. There are also instant-win games, such as scratcher cards. Most of the Bitcoin lottery sites provide similar offerings. So, you shouldn\u2019t need to spend much time learning how to play. Lottoland Launches World\u2019s First Regulated Bitcoin LotteryIn 2017, a gambling site called Lottoland attracted attention for creating what it advertised as the first regulated Bitcoin jackpot. When playing the Pick 6 game offered at Lottoland, people have a 1-in-7 chance of winning a prize. The system set up there is a good example of a well-known lottery game structure. People mark their chosen numbers on an electronic ticket.Few Long Established SitesWhile researching Bitcoin lottery sites, it becomes clear they often don\u2019t have staying power. Three sites mentioned in media sources (BTCFreeLotto.com, 10XBTC and World Super Lotto) have since stopped operating. Similarly, Kibo Lotto, the site mentioned earlier, is still in the coming-soon stage according to its website. There\u2019s also a mobile lottery ticket app site called Jackpocket that reportedly started offering Bitcoin as a method of paying for lottery tickets in 2016. However, there are no newer mentions of that option in the media or within the Jackpocket homepage or help database. In that case, Jackpocket itself is more established but seems to have moved away from dealing with Bitcoin.Play With CautionThe information here emphasizes why you should be exceptionally careful when playing Bitcoin lotteries. Plus, watch out for related social media posts. In one recent incident, hackers took over the official Twitter feed of the South African cricket board and used it to try and interest people in a Bitcoin lottery. Lotteries require people to weigh the risks with the possible rewards, and doing that is especially necessary with the Bitcoin varieties.Have you tried any of the Bitcoin lotteries or is simply holding BTC the best strategy?

Too gritty. Too rowdy. Unsafe. But let\u2019s look at how Bitcoin is changing this. East Fremont Street, the major arterial downtown, was decrepit and in a state of disrepair just a few years ago. But it\u2019s now in the midst of a major renaissance, having emerged as a robust thoroughfare of pedestrian activity.And at the epicenter of it all? BitcoinA major catalyst behind the economic resurgence of this area was the arrival of the online shoe and clothing retailer Zappos in 2009. Sensing downtown\u2019s immense potential, founder and CEO Tony Hsieh proceeded to pump millions into the area.But an even bigger accelerant for downtown, which was once the Las Vegas strip, is businessman and bitcoin supporter Derek Stevens.In 2012 he repurposed the downtrodden Fitzgerald Hotel into a swanky casino resort known as the D Hotel. Later the D\u2019s sister hotel known as the Golden Gate Hotel & Casino was also renovated. Together these two locales were the first Las Vegas casinos to begin accepting bitcoin.A Detroit native and co-owner and CEO of both hotels, Stevens is a fun loving guy who loves mingling at the D\u2019s Longbar with hotel patrons and guests. It was here, says Stevens, where guests started planting the seed for bitcoin as a payment option for guests and visitors. He notes that a series of these late night conversations is what fueled the fire around this idea. Unable to come up with a reason not to accept bitcoin, he forged forward with a plan.Today, these casino properties have become a magnet for throngs of Bitcoin enthusiasts and visitors seeking to spend their crypto for room stays and gift shop merchandise.Las Vegas Home to Hundreds of Bitcoin-Friendly BusinessesThere is also a luxury steakhouse on the second level of the D that accepts bitcoin. Moreover, bitcoin ATM\u2019s \u2013 nearly a hundred \u2013 are littered throughout each of the properties.Coinmap, for example, displays hundreds of bitcoin-friendly locations in the vicinity of Vegas.Despite the fact that Bitcoin is seen in some circles as the next big thing to hit Las Vegas, casinos there may never accept it on the gaming floor due to Nevada industry regulations.Now Steven\u2019s has plans to erect a new resort, Circa, the first in over a decade along Fremont street. Slated to open in 2020 with over 777 rooms, it will feature a snazzy sportsbook venue along with a huge rooftop pool that is already being touted as one of the largest in the world. With news of this new addition to the downtown Las Vegas scene, the question that\u2019s now being bantered around is will Circa, too, accept bitcoin. In Las Vegas parlance, let\u2019s just say that it\u2019s a pretty good bet it will.Is a nuetral form of digital money like Bitcoin a perfect fit for a global gambling hub like Las Vegas?Images via Shutterstock, CoinATMradar.comThe Rundown And at the epicenter of it all?

The illegal drug marketplace conducted its business on Dream Market, which is now suspected of being compromised as a \u201choney pot\u201d by law enforcement agencies.Multi-Million \u2018Dream Market\u2019 Bust in New JerseyAuthorities have arrested three men after a two-year investigation. The criminal probe uncovered a drug-dealing storefront named Sinmed, which was operating on the deep web marketplace Dream Market.Buckets of drugs were seized as part of the sting, including Xanax and Fentanyl-laced heroin, as well as methamphetamine.The criminals offered drugs in exchange for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.The seizure was reported as highly significant according to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, stating:Not only is this the first time state prosecutors in New York have taken down a dark web storefront, this takedown represents the largest pill seizure in New Jersey\u2019s history.The investigation appears to be part of a larger operation run by FBI, Europol and other law enforcement agencies.

The new onion address was also claimed to be \u201ccurrently offline, opening soon.\u201dTwitter user DarkDotFail was quick to assume that Dream Market and its new \u201cpartner company\u201d were in fact honeypots set up by international authorities. The intention of honeypot sites is to track (and eventually prosecute) illegal activities such as selling drugs and other illegal goods on the deepweb.ALERT: Assume that Dream Market is compromised. Today they announced they are shutting down 30 days from now, in April. Law enforcement ran Hansa as a honeypot for 30 days after seizing it.

Apart from the fact that Binance Chain opens a new world of possibilities for cryptocurrency projects, the BEPs protocol on Binance Chain also shows some significant difference Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 protocol that currently dominates the crypto space. For instance, the BEP2 standard makes it possible to issue crypto tokens that can be pegged to any other altcoin as opposed to the current standards that only pegs tokens against ETH or BTC. The Binance chain also includes other features such as minting, burning, transferring or freezing tokens.Below is a list of existing projects that have migrated to the Binance Chain since its launch:BNBNOWMITHPHXAWCBinance Coin (BNB)It goes without saying or special expectation that Binance Coin (BNB) has been migrated from Ethereum to the Binance chain as the native cryptocurrency on the platform. Binance Coin on Binance Chain will serve the same purpose that Ethereum serves on Ethereum network to pay for network transactions among other things.BNB tokens, originally an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token is now being migrated to become a BEP2 token powered by the Binance chain. People who currently own ERC20 BNB coins are expected to send the ERC20 tokens to a new Binance Chain deposit address. Binance with then convert their ERC20 tokens to the new BEP tokens automatically.Last week, Binance announced that it has burned 5 million ERC20 tokens and allocated native BEP2 tokens to wallets on Binance Chain. The old BNB ERC20 tokens were burned to manage supply on both Ethereum and Binance networks. However, trading of BNB on Binance Chain won\u2019t start until the first batch of BNB has been converted and there enough liquidity to support trades.ChangeNow (NOW)ChangeNow, a cryptocurrency exchange that facilitates the registration-free exchange of tokens has announced that its NOW token will now be issued on Binance Chain and that it will be listed on Binance DEX. ChangeNow choose Binance Chain because it offers a strategic advantage that complements how ChangeNow facilitates token swaps without charging transaction fees.ChangeNow went for a hybrid arrangement, leaving half of their tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, while moving the other half onto the Binance Chain. ChangeNow will allow its holders to burn their ERC-20 tokens, and exchange them for a BEP2 compliant version for the foreseeable future.Binance\u2019s founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao has also expressed his support for having the NOW token clinching the title of the first token to be listed on Binance DEX.CZ also commented on ChangeNOW being the first to issue their token on their chain, the true decentralized way:Mithril (MITH)Mithril (MITH) is also migrating to Binance Chain. Mithril is a decentralized social media platform that rewards people for creating content though an ecosystem where content creators and curators are reward with MITH tokens. In a blog post published last week, Mithril revealed that it is migrating its project to the Binance chain to provide its users with an opportunity to experience the security, intuitive user interface, and speed of the Binance DEX platform.Mithril notes that \u201cBinance Chain\u2019s focus on usability, security, along with the incredible speed of one-second block times, made migrating to the Binance Chain an important strategic initiative for us this quarter.\u201dDeposits and withdrawals of MITH tokens on Binance exchange will be suspended for the 12-hour during which the migration will be initiated. Afterwards, users can withdraw their MITH tokens to BEP2 compliant wallets as a precursor to trading the coins on Binance DEX.Red Pulse Phoenix [PHX]Red Pulse Phoenix [PHX] has also announced that it is migrating a major portion of its token ecosystem to the Binance Chain. Red Pulse Phoenix is both a platform that connects researchers with report-consumers as well as a token for managing IP protecting, Proof of creation, and Proof of Ownership among other things.As part of the migration, Red Pulse Phoenix will launch a new BEP2 token with ticker PHB for the Binance Chain ecosystem. It also plans to eventually migrate its NEP-5 PHX tokens to BEP2 PHB tokens. The old PHX tokens will continue to be tradeable on Binance.com pending the migration and the new BEP-2 PHB tokens will be traded on both Binance.com and the Binance DEX.Binance users who currently hold PHX on Binance.com can expect that their PHX tokens will be migrated to PHB and the total token circulating supply of PHX + PHB will remain the same in line with Red Pulse\u2019s original tokenomics for market-driven trading price and market capitalization.Atomic Wallet (AWC)Atomic, a multi-asset non-custodial wallet that implements cross-chain Atomic Swaps across 20 Blockchains and tokens has been announced as now of the very first projects that will be migrated to the Binance Chain.Atomic has revealed that its upcoming Atomic Wallet will provide full support for Binance Chain and BNB Coin while its AWC token will be listed on Binance DEX. However, Atomic will keep its current ERC-20 AWC tokens while maintaining the new AWC token powered by Binance\u2019s BEP2 protocol. To manage the tokenomics, Atomic will burn 50 million AWC ERC-20 tokens representing 50% of its current total supply on Ethereum.Interestingly, users will be able to swap between both the ERC-20 powered AWC tokens and the BEP2 AWC tokens."}

The rehabilitation trustee in the case estimates the actual damages caused to be at least forty times lower ($6,100,000 USD) than the fifteen billion dollars claimed by CoinLab.Although not specifically mentioned, the site covering the case, WizSec, mentions that the \u201celephant in the room\u201d is the ongoing case between CoinLab and Mt.Gox as a primary cause of the delay in bitcoin moving from Mt.Gox.The lawsuit was the aftermath of a failed partnership attempt that took place between the companies in 2012 and 2013.The case has been covered by Bitcoinist extensively in the past, with the most recent update being that Mt.Gox\u2019s stash of bitcoin will remain in the company\u2019s possession at least until 2020.CoinLab\u2019s scope of \u201cdamages\u201d revealed The first insight was the scope of the damages claimed by CoinLab. WizSec stated that the company\u2019s claim was \u201calmost two and a half times as large as the sum of all the claims combined.\u201d While also pointing out that the remaining funds in Mt.Gox are \u201ccustomer funds\u201d and not owned by a custodial entity, therefore making the claims of money owed irrational.Mt. Gox Trustee, Nobuaki KobayashiWizSec summarized CoinLab\u2019s intention with the following:Basically, if you had bitcoin in MtGox you\u2019ve already lost 80%+ of your money, and now CoinLab is doing their best to finish the job.In the original post, WizSec summarized the content of two documents: CoinLab\u2019s civil rehabilitation claim assessment petition (March 6, 2019) and the response of the trustee (April 12, 2019).CoinLab\u2019s monetary claim is below and taken from the original post by WizSec.In addition to the above, CoinLab also demands that Mt.Gox pay for CoinLab\u2019s legal fees.On the other hand, WizSec notes that the trustee overseeing the case \u201cinsists that CoinLab\u2019s claims are assessed at JPY and that the company should pay its own legal fees.\u201dIllegal contracts everywhereWizSec notes that after the agreement was signed between CoinLab and Mt.Gox that \u201chistory diverges sharply depending on who you ask\u201d and makes the following interpretation:The contract was probably rendered invalid and/or CoinLab breached it by not being legally compliant in all US States, thus failing to to fulfill the whole point of the agreement and their claims of calculations are \u201cabsolute nonsense.\u201dThe biggest disagreementThe biggest disagreement was over state licensing and if CoinLab was compliant. Mt.Gox attorneys stated that the licenses were required but not sought after while CoinLab maintains the position that it was always compliant.Interestingly, WizSec stated that CoinLab actually applied for a state license in Washington state, which would mean they were aware of state-licensing from the beginning.Disputes, drama, and a lawsuitWizSec notes that there were clearly business disputes with each party trying to get the other to provide the relevant materials. The dispute continued until it eventually escalated to a lawsuit filed by CoinLab in 2013.WizSec also noted the total sum of money that was sent and received between the two companies:Out of an eventual 12 million USD deposited, CoinLab ended up forwarding 7 million USD to MtGox, with CoinLab still owing MtGox customers the remaining 5 million USD.CoinLab\u2019s \u201cDamages\u201d and \u201cCalculations\u201dCoinLab\u2019s case is simple in premise but severely convoluted in its claimed damages. CoinLabs argues that Mt.Gox breached the contract in \u201cmultiple ways\u201d and was, therefore \u201crobbed of the revenue it would have received had the license been fulfilled.\u201dWizSec claimed the following: CoinLab argues that because the agreement was for a term of ten years, plus sharing for an additional 5 years of revenue after termination, they were owed a total amount of 15 years worth of revenue on 25% of global trade volume.WizSec notes that CoinLab is claiming damages totaling \u201c$15,167,076,055 USD plus an extra $1,127,731,005 USD per year that the proceedings drag out past June 2018.These numbers come from their calculations of lost revenue, delay damages, civil rehabilitation, and other sources.WizSec finally notes that the trustee of the case has termed Coinlab\u2019s estimates \u201cimpossible and completely groundless\u201d and disputes every aspect of its calculation method.The trustee\u2019s own calculation put CoinLab\u2019s revenue share to be at approximately 636,000,000 JPY ($6,100,000 USD), roughly 40 times less than the $15,167,076,055 USD claimed by CoinLab.In closing, the trustee appears to be negating every part of CoinLab\u2019s claims and has \u201cgiven no indication of negotiation or compromise.\u201dWhen will the Bitcoin move?The Bitcoin in Mt.Gox\u2019s possession, which is estimated to be 141,000 coins, won\u2019t be distributed to the creditors until at least 2020 due to the recent deadline extension; though, it\u2019s now likely to drag on for longer because of the aforementioned lawsuits.

The summons comes after Craig Wright, one of the co-founders of Bitcoin SV who alleges it to be the \u2018real\u2019 Bitcoin, gave an interview to Australian media network Finder. During the debate, which lasted over 90 minutes, Wright accused McAfee of \u201cbuilding a career out of being a conman.\u201d\u201cPlease sue me, Mr. McAfee,\u201d he said, alluding to current mass lawsuit he and Ayre are orchestrating against anyone who disputes claims Wright created Bitcoin.\u201c\u2026I want you in court.\u201dWhile not addressing Wright directly, McAfee took issue with the content of the interview, demanding Ayre make use of his current whereabouts to argue his corner.\u201cI am right now staying less than a quarter of a mile from Craig\u2019s partner \u2013 Calvin Ayre.

Frequently changing his location, the entrepreneur spends most of his time on a private boat as he flees US demands to face charges of tax evasion. Ayre, who himself successfully managed to get US money laundering charges against him dropped in 2017, has yet to respond to the challenge. Amid an ongoing publicity nightmare for the controversial Bitcoin SV, the altcoin has seen the bottom fall through its support over the past month as major cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously withdrew support for it. That decision is also tied to Wright\u2019s lawsuits and other behavior, which industry CEOs view as threatening and not in-keeping with the moral values notionally tied to decentralized cryptocurrency. At press time, BSV/USD traded at around $53, almost exactly 1/100th of the Bitcoin price and just $10 above its all-time lows. Last week, Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO of Japanese giant SBI Group, took a board member position at Ripple, having confirmed his own exchange would not support Bitcoin SV and cease dealing with its predecessor, Bitcoin Cash (BCH). \u201cCoins that regularly experience hard forks are ludicrous,\u201d he said, referring to the turbulent genesis of Bitcoin SV last November.What do you think about John McAfee\u2019s reaction to Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright?

This indicator could help traders understand if a strong price trend is in force.It should be noted that there is already a directional movement indicator that was developed in the 1970s named the Average Directional Index (ADX). The ADX appears to follow the same premise as the Bitcoin Momentum Chart \u2014 although this new chart might be easier for new traders to read and therefore understand.Signaling and investment-related chartsWoobull seemingly offers traders and investors charts and data that they cannot easily find online. For instance, many, (if not all) of the charts on Woobull are sourced outside of the mainstream technical analysis sites such as tradingview.com or CoinMarketCap.The site, therefore, might be more suited towards investors who look at long-term and secular trends than swing or day traders that look at the hourly candles. Still, the information provided from Woobull remains objectively useful for anyone with a technical or financial interest in Bitcoin.One interesting chart above is titled \u201cBitcoin Risk Adjusted Returns vs Other Assets.\u201d The chart is used to \u201ccompare Bitcoin ROI, adjusted for its risk, to other assets.\u201dAnother graph to pay attention to is its \u201cHODL Waves\u201d which claims to offer \u201cA cross-sectional view of Bitcoin HODLers over time, shows demand and supply from new and old HODLers.\u201dThe Bitcoin Valuation cap shows \u201ca collection of useful valuation metrics on Bitcoin.\u201dThe Bitcoin NVT ratio shows when the currency is either overbought or oversold, which functions identically to the existing calculations of the RSI or stochastics that also measure extreme readings.Bitcoin monetary and network statisticsThe below chart shows the difference between Bitcoin\u2019s network value and network volume.The graph below claims to \u201cchart user-centric metrics tracking network congestion, e.g. payment fees, confirmation times.\u201dThe graph below shows the growth (inflation) of bitcoin over time.In closing, there are many more charts that WooBull offers that will be of interest to anyone invested in Bitcoin.

And although Binfinex challenges the claims, the ripples from the splash are already affecting both its business and Tether\u2019s.The Story Bitfinex Wish Would DieFor anyone who missed it, the New York Attorney General accused Bitfinex of covering up a large hole in its finances using money borrowed from Tether reserves. Bitfinex argued that the $850 million hole was just temporary, and the Tether money was simply a loan (with interest).But this was not enough to stem the flow of funds and traders away from the platform. It was forced to withdraw, first 17k and then a further 12.6k bitcoin from its cold wallets, to cover the exodus. The story has also shaken confidence in Tether, causing a $300 premium on bitcoin price on Bitfinex, as traders exchange Tether for bitcoin and leave the site.One of the main points of concern for investors is that Tether is supposedly 100% USD-backed, not supported on Bitfinex stock.Tether Is 74% Backed, But By What?Tether yesterday disclosed to a New York state court that the stable coin is backed by cash and short-term securities equal to 74% of its outstanding coins. This roughly equates to the market cap, minus the $700 million repurposed by Bitfinex.But self-proclaimed tweet poet, Max Keiser, wasn\u2019t going to let that lie, questioning the value of USD backing in any case.Tether is 74% backedby Fed-$\u2019s that are 1% backedby JPMorgan that is -1,500%(un)backed.by the global banking cartel that is irredeemably insolvent. #Bitcoin is 100% backed. pic.twitter.com/tt7755LqTh\u2014 Max Keiser, tweet poet.

In this regard, Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group, told MarketWatch,Bitcoin has superior physical properties and market utility.Grayscale\u2019s social media ad campaign #DropGold is based on the premise that the yellow metal is obsolete as a store-of-value in the new global digital, economic model.Why is #gold still in your portfolio? #DropGold\u2014 Grayscale (@GrayscaleInvest) May 1, 2019Specifically, Grayscale describes its campaign as,#DropGold is our ad campaign which focuses on the emergence of Bitcoin as an alternative to investing in gold.

For millennia, gold was used as a symbol of wealth and as currency.In 1792, the United States Congress decided to adopt a gold and silver standard, establishing a fixed price of gold in terms of U.S. dollars. Thus, gold coins became legal tender in the country. Later on, in 1944, the Bretton Woods Agreements created a world gold exchange standard, where the price of gold was pegged to the U.S. dollar.Then, in 1971, gold began to decline more explicitly when President Richard Nixon ended the Bretton Woods system. As a result, now, no country uses the gold standard.Today, data indicate that Bitcoin is already outperforming gold, as well as Nasdaq and the S&P 500.Thus, Grayscale\u2019s new movement questions whether gold is indeed a good investment, and emphasizes,Gold represents the past \u2013 Nixon dropped the gold standard in the \u201970s.

Now, Bitcoinist analyst FilbFilb notes, the pattern of behavior on Bitcoin markets is beginning to mirror similar moves from 2017 \u2013 just before BTC/USD 00 hit its all-time historic highs around $20,000.\u201cThere is some similarity between 2017 and 2019 in the way in which we bottomed from ($5000 to $3000 in) 2017 and broke back to ($5000),\u201d he summarized in fresh analysis. \u201cIt took a lot longer this time in a bear market.\u201dMarkets Shake Off Tether WoesAs Bitcoinist previously reported, the 2018 bear market produced so far the lowest post-$20,000 bottom for Bitcoin in December, when markets hit $3130 and traders warned of a dip as low as 2013\u2019s highs of $1300.Since then, the mood had improved dramatically, previously bearish forecasters flipping bullish on the back of April\u2019s performance.Continuing, FilbFilb thus foresees a replay of bullish momentum from the second half of 2017, subject to market resilience over ongoing legal issues facing stablecoin Tether (USDT).\u201cOverlay & Extrapolate that trend and Dec 2019 could be fruity if we can get over the Tether risk,\u201d he concluded.That risk may well have already proven to be considerably less than during previous episodes of uncertainty over the fate of both Tether and sister cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. While news of legal demands from New York Attorney General sent Bitcoin price tumbling around $400 April 26, a rebound quickly ensued.Fundstrat Global Advisors\u2019 Tom Lee, who in a return to Bitcoin price commentary suggested a bull market could be underway, likewise highlighted resilience among markets.New all-time Bitcoin price highs, he said, could hit in 2020, something which the Bitcoin block reward halving, scheduled for May, could serve to precipitate. According to previous research, the impact of the halving could be felt on markets as soon as June this year if Bitcoin follows its historical behaviorial trends.

The report claimed that OneCoin had used two Samoan churches with branches in Australia and New Zealand to achieve this.The Central Bank\u2019s acting-governor, Gilbert Wongsin, said hundreds of Samoans had invested in OneCoin. The investigation will seek to establish whether the churches (Samoa Worship Centre and the Samoan Independent Seventh Day Adventist Church) breached local anti-money-laundering regulations.We Never Done Wrong, Honest To GodJosh Seiuli, a pastor with Samoa Worship Centre in the capital Apia, said around 500 parishioners had invested in OneCoin. However, he claimed that most (himself included) had not broken the law, as they had invested before the Central Bank banned such transactions last May.Regarding the churches involvement, Seiuli said it was exploring legal action against the Central Bank for defamation, adding that:Honest to god, we never done any transfer or any transfer action using Worship Centre accounts.He did, however, admit to assisting congregation members who \u2018wanted to invest\u2019, by answering questions to help them understand OneCoin.Preying On Communities of FaithThis perhaps best illustrates the betrayal of trust of these church-centered Pacific communities. According to some, OneCoin abused the strong sense of trust placed in ministers and pastors in such communities, to sell their product quickly.Before the Central Bank imposed the ban, OneCoin held presentations to parishioners at Samoa Worship Centre. One parishioner interviewed had gained an internal OneCoin qualification, as an independent marketing associate, allowing him to sell on the scheme to others.In March, the OneCoin ringleaders were charged in the US, as one of them, Konstantin Ignatov, was arrested by authorities.Will OneCoin go down in Samoa?

This move comes as part of the company\u2019s efforts to diversify its investment holdings which previously focused on the cryptocurrency and blockchain market.On Monday (April 29, 2019), the company filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) a cooperation agreement with the Heilongjiang hemp research institute. The agreement sees both companies developing multiple varieties of medicinal hemp strains.Explaining the importance of the partnership, Yao Yongjie, the co-chairman of Grandshores Technology, said:Through our partnership with Heilongjiang hemp research institute, we have gained an advantage in accessing high-quality cannabis seeds, with high levels of CBD. We want to be a key supplier of industrial and medicinal cannabis and control that supply from the source.Another HKEX filing shows Grandshores is also looking to acquire a 40 percent equity stake in Hangzhou Yupu Trading \u2013 a hemp trading company. Hangzhou Yupu Trading has a one-year, 1,600kg allocation for a specialized hemp plant from the Heilongjiang hemp research institute.According to Yao, the company is serious about its foray into cannabis. Yao says by 2020, the company will decide on whether to focus most of its resources on the hemp industry rather than cryptocurrency investment positions.The Intersection of Bitcoin, Blockchain, and CannabisYao believes that 2020 will mark a watershed year for cannabis investment as the emerging asset class begins to mature. Bitcoin held off an 80 percent drop in 2018 and has continued to experience steady gains so far in 2019.Commenting on the prospects of both markets, the Grandshores Technology chief opined:Both blockchain and industrial cannabis are the future, and both are embraced by the younger generation. Grandshores Technology is a company that invests in the future and we are always on the search for new business growth opportunities.However, like the crypto market, the cannabis scene is still grappling with a patchwork of loose regulations and government apathy. Several projects have come up in the last few years trying to revolutionize the industry with limited success thus far.As previously reported by Bitcoinist, Paragon \u2013 a cannabis startup lost 96 percent of its post-ICO market capitalization.Do you think cannabis is a suitable diversifier for firms with cryptocurrency investment portfolios?

The independent ratings agency has given Bitcoin an A \u201ctech/adoption\u201d grade along with Ripple\u2019s XRP and Ethereum-competitor EOS. Weiss Report Predicts a \u2018Bright Future\u2019Weiss evaluates cryptocurrencies combining two factors, the adoption rate and technology. Upon evaluation, Weiss assigns letter grades indicating the crypto asset\u2019s likelihood to succeed and its long-term sustainability.On 26 March 2019, Weiss published a comprehensive report on the crypto market entitled \u201cDark Shadows with a Bright Future.\u201dThe report is the outcome of reviewing 122 digital coins against four factors: technology, adoption, risk, and reward. Then, strictly basing the rating only on technology and adoption factors, Weiss concludes that the ten top cryptocurrencies are as shown in the table below: Weiss proposes that \u201cultimately, only cryptocurrencies boasting the best combination of adoption and technology will succeed.\u201d And it rates Bitcoin, EOS, and XRP with the highest letter grade: \u201cA\u201d rate (excellent).And when the analysis also includes risk and rewards factors, the ranking is as follows:The report argues that although the value of cryptocurrencies significantly declined in 2018, crypto technology continued to evolve, and new crypto assets were launched exhibiting faster processing speeds. As a result, adoption rates have increased.Additionally, Weiss notes,Since February 2018, the volume of user (on-chain) transactions among the ten most widely used cryptocurrencies has grown by 245 percent.Bitcoin \u2018Best Positioned\u2019 to Become a Popular SoVLast year, Weiss had ranked Bitcoin with a \u201cC-\u201d rate under the all four-factor evaluation (adoption, technology, risk, and reward). At that time, Weiss explained that Bitcoin had obtained this rating was because the currency was being afflicted by significant transaction delays and high transaction costs.Now, Weiss has upgraded Bitcoin to \u201cB+\u201d, highlighting that its technology has dramatically improved. Specifically, the report states,Bitcoin has been upgraded with the roll-out of its Lightning Network and is the best positioned to become a popular store of value for savers and investors.It should also be noted that Weiss consideres Bitcoin to still be \u201cthe proven leader in adoption.\u201d What\u2019s more, BTC doesn\u2019t have much competition even among high-ranking altcoins who are vying for different markets.The main competitor of XRP, for example, is the legacy SWIFT network. While EOS, Ethereum and Cardano are focused on smart-contracts and \u201cinnovative governance features.\u201dBitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, is still the proven leader in adoption\u2026 Like gold bullion, its value is not controlled by monetary authorities, and it can be a safe haven in times of turmoil.

A Litany of SettlementsThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reaching settlements with cryptocurrency Initial Coin Offering (ICO) projects that accept the Commission\u2019s ruling on violating securities regulations.Fortune reports that the SEC has reached settlement deals with some ICO projects in the U.S. for offering tokens deemed to be securities by the Commission. According to the report, some projects even got off lightly, without having to pay a fine.Speaking to Fortune, Victor Santos of Airfox, one of the ICO projects fined by the SEC opined:What we\u2019re hoping for is by us being compliant, we\u2019ll be ready when new regulation comes out.As previously reported by Bitcoinist, the SEC fined Airfox about $250,000 and instructed the company to return investor funds with interest. The Commission also advised the company to follow the due process of carrying out a securities offering to the public.Airfox is one of many projects to run afoul of the SEC as soon as the Commission began shinning the spotlight on the ICO arena in 2017. Apart from CEOs, public figures who promote ICOs have also had run-ins with the securities regulator.Back in November 2018, the SEC fined DJ Khaled and Floyd Mayweather a total of $800,000 plus a ban on engaging in promotional activities for two-three years. Both celebrities had been involved in the promotional campaign for the Centra Tech ICO scam.SEC Defiant on ICOs Being SecuritiesMeanwhile, there are calls within the U.S. for a more nuanced approach to cryptocurrency regulation beyond the scope of existing rules and codes.SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, has consistently maintained that the Commission sees most ICOs as securities even if the principal agents say their tokens are utilities. Some commentators believe that the SEC needs to revamp its laws to account for the unique nature of blockchain-based assets.It seems a common belief that digital assets can only fit a single category under US law\u2013in other words, that they can be commodities OR securities OR property OR money OR speech, but not more than one.That's wrong. Digital assets can be, and likely are, many of these at once.\u2014 Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) March 25, 2019The Commission\u2019s categorization of many ICO tokens as securities remains a primary sticking point for some stakeholders. Many believe that the Howey Test isn\u2019t sufficient to classify the many forms of blockchain tokens which can fall under utility, payment, and asset tokens to mention a few.Meanwhile, ICO token sales are the midst of a significant decline as fundraising figures continue to plummet.

And then there\u2019s market dominance, which is BTC\u2019s percentage of the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies. But what if we\u2019ve all been wrong on this last one?When considering Bitcoin\u2019s \u2018Market Dominance\u2019, we generally go to the measure used by CoinMarketCap. But whilst comparing BTC to the total market cap certainly gives us market share, maybe \u2018dominance\u2019 should include other factors?That was the theory John-Paul Thorbjornsen investigated, after feeling the current 50% \u2018dominance\u2019 score didn\u2019t give a true representation. A better reflection of Bitcoin\u2019s dominance, he suggested, might include some measure of liquidity, or daily trading volume.Pareto Distribution and Power LawHis research revolved around the Pareto principle or 80/20 rule. This states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Or in this case that 20% of cryptocurrencies should dominate 80% of the market. This principle often occurs in nature where the rule of equilibrium abounds. As a free market, cryptocurrency trading could well follow this pattern, which is a form of Power Law.Thorbjornsen compared the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap on a logarithmic scale. He found that while there was some form of Power Law, volumes did not correlate well. Some coins had less than 0.1% of market cap in daily volume, indicating a trapped market or artificial market cap.Volume-Weighted Market DominanceWhen Thorbjornsen multiplied the volume by the market cap (Volume-Weighted Cap), he found a much higher correlation. Removing the bottom third of the coins (to correct for \u2018Page 1 Effect\u2019), strongly suggested that this was indeed a Power Law distribution.Calculating a new measure of Bitcoin Dominance using this metric, showed a level consistently over 80%. In fact, considering only the top 5 cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (the 20%) dominates over 85% of the market. This fits the Pareto distribution hypothesis originally suggested.The King Is Dead, Long Live The KingSo should we all forget about CoinMarketCap\u2019s \u2018market dominance\u2019 metric?Well no, although it might be better renamed \u2018market (cap) share.\u2019 As a metric, it can be useful. In Bitcoinist\u2019s latest article on the subject, lower Bitcoin market dominance index has actually historically coincided with a higher bitcoin price.But in the future, when talking about true market dominance, it would probably be wise to consider the volume-weighted cap as a more accurate measure. Particularly when the liquidity and volume of some altcoins are almost non-existent.Does this new way to measure market dominance paint a more accurate picture?

Back in 2018, Canaan, one of Bitmain\u2019s competitors was also unable to go forward with its IPO filing on the HKEX.According to the listing requirements as stated by the HKEX, IPO applications that fail to move to the \u201chearing stage\u201d within six months, automatically become expired.

According to the HKEX listing guidelines:The latest financial period reported on by the reporting accountants for a new application must not have ended more than six months from the date of the listing document.Based on the above rule, Bitmain will be forced to release its Q3 2018 financials, to the public. Reports indicate that the company lost more than $740 million in that particular period and has refused to disclose any figures.Dovey Wan, founding partner at Primitive believes the company might look to the NASDAQ.

Celer Network Sale \u2018Success\u2019Binance Launchpad concluded its third token sale for the year. The project, called Celer Network, sold out its planned supply of almost 600 million CELR tokens in a little less than 18 minutes.The event raised a grand total of $4 million. Bitcoinist reported earlier this year on BitTorrent\u2019s ICO launched through Binance\u2019s platform, which managed to raise $7.1 million in 15 minutes.Fetch.AI was the project prior to Celer Network, which also sold out in seconds, reaching its hard cap of $6 million.Immediately after the CELR sale concluded, Changpeng \u2018CZ\u2019 Zhao, revealed that it was \u201cactually the highest buy demand sale we seen so far.\u201dHow Successful Was The Sale Really?Hours before the CELR sale started, Binance officially instructed users to refresh the dedicated tokens sale page as soon as the timer hits zero.Many users, however, complained that by doing so, the platform had logged them out, rendering them unable to log back in for a short period of time. Once they did manage to get back onto the page, most of the users had their orders placed in a queue and were never processed.Hence, the majority of those who tried to participate failed to get a piece of the highly sought-after CELR token.Commenting on the matter, Zhao explained that the platform \u201cstill had capacity/caching issues\u201d, while reassuring that they \u201cwill keep working on it for a better experience in the future.\u201dStill, the results speak for themselves.\u201cSTATS: 39003 people tried to buy, 3129 people got some. 35000 people will be somewhat unhappy,\u201d said CZ.It\u2019s worth noting that the same concerns were expressed by the community during the first two token sales as well.The Solution? Dibs For BNB \u2018Hodlers\u2019Immediately after the CELR token sale, Zhao hinted at a possible solution for the bottleneck problem.Interestingly enough, instead of increasing server capacity to cope with demand, Zhao suggested another alternative. One that would incentivize Binance Coin (BNB) users to become \u2018hodlers.\u2019\u201cWe *may* try a different approach next time, a BNB holding allocation model. Still thinking about it\u2026\u201dThe idea seems to be growing in popularity, as a recent discussion on Twitter is gaining momentum.Careful what you wish for https://t.co/eeQvfDrUXI\u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) March 21, 2019As it is right now, all the sales launched to Binance Launchpad are explicitly available to BNB holders, as the tokens are only purchased with BNB. The only exception so far has been BitTorrent\u2019s sale, where users were also allowed to buy tokens with Tron\u2019s TRX.In other words, the contemplated structure would have to impose an additional requirement, such as holding BNB for a certain amount of time, for example.The main question, however, still remains. Why not, first and foremost, increase server capacity to handle the increasing demand?Perhaps the launchpad bottlenecks are not a bug but a feature. Think: Apple and what they used to do with iPhones when only select stores received the new models initially, resulting in long queues and additional media hype.One thing is obvious, though. Since Binance Launchpad started launching sales, BNB has performed splendidly, gaining around 150 percent since January 1st. So incentivizing BNB token holders to \u2018hodl\u2019 in exchange for VIP access is likely another (brilliant) way to pump its price.[Disclaimer: The author of this article holds a small amount of BNB.]What do you think of the proposed changes for Binance Launchpad?

Chris Harfield and Joe Williams, founders of Williams-Harfield sports group, pioneered the first Formula One cryptocurrency partnership. Now, they explained what that deal really means for the whole cryptocurrency industry. Do even cryptocurrencies fit Formula One?Chris Harfield: I think they do. Cryptocurrencies, as of right now, are cutting the edge. The technology is futuristic. And what Formula One does, it pioneers things in the automatic sector. Things that are for the future. When we talk about regenerating energy from F1 car\u2019s brakes, it is a technologically advanced solution. That was pioneered in Formula One. And later it was distributed to the rest of the world. So, this approach aligns with cryptocurrencies. It is forward-thinking. It is a revolution the way people use and hold money. Time will tell if it\u2019s something that would be picked up by the masses. The same case is with Formula One developments. I\u2019m sure that cryptocurrencies will be picked up by major population.Why is FuturoCoin\u2019s sponsorship so unique?CH: It is unique because it is the first of its kind. These days, it is very rare to be the first one within your industry to make that sort of sponsorship deal. Thanks to the partnership with Aston Martin Red Bull Racing, FuturoCoin has become the first digital currency to ever sponsor Formula One team. There won\u2019t be another chance for other digital assets to be the first again. This is why it is a historic moment for the whole cryptocurrency industry, and it will be remembered forever.Do you think, there will be others, who will follow the path of FTO?CH: Eventually, yes. It will be interesting to see, how the rest [of the industry \u2013 ed.] will initially react, and what they will want to do. Maybe, they will try to do more next time. Perhaps some digital assets will try to take over the name of the Formula One team. Maybe this time next year, we will be calling it FuturoCoin Red Bull Racing.Please, tell me, what really makes the sport better than music, movies or celebrities. Why is it better to sponsor sports teams rather than actors or musicians?Joe Williams: Emotions. The emotions are a huge factor. You don\u2019t have that with music or films. There is lots of passion, but the level of emotions will never be even close to those from the sport. You don\u2019t get millions of people tuning in every week to follow musicians or actors. Once a year, twice, maybe. But not every week. In Formula One, you have 21 races all around the world, with this huge global viewership. It\u2019s the media numbers and the wider range you get through Formula One. That makes it so appealing.CH: And the social side. Last night, there was a big football match. Everybody met in the bars to watch that match. They don\u2019t do that for music events. They don\u2019t do it to watch actors. They might go to the cinema, but they won\u2019t do that every week. You can\u2019t watch something new with your favorite actor every weekend. In the sport, you\u2019ve got constant access to the massive fanbase that the competition has. Games are the only thing that people still do watch live. Other things, you can enjoy on demand. You can watch Netflix, where you can pause anytime you want. You can always come back to that another time. In the sport, you just can\u2019t do that. Because of that, brands will continue to promote themselves within sports. If you look at the tv advertising, a lot of people change channels when the commercial is on or they leave the room. When it comes to sports event, you just watch advertisements on cars, equipment, etc.But sports sponsorship is quite expensive, especially Formula One. So, do you think that the profit of this deal would be bigger than the costs?JW: There are always different ways to measure the return of investment in terms of media exposure. Everything has to be counted in. All brands measure success differently. They relate to many things, among others: the growth of the company during the period of sponsorship deal, the amount of social engagement they get, the followers, and the number of coin holders in the FuturoCoin\u2019s case. We can\u2019t predict the future. But based on the past, the data suggest that FTO will get the return of the investment. Huge brands do that all around the world. They come into the sport and usually stay in the number of years, so it has to be profitable.CH: It is always a tricky thing to measure the return of investment . This is the first partnership of its kind. It is the first time. So, we know as much as everybody else. We are waiting to see how this deal will develop. Only after some time, we will be able to assess the whole cooperation.However, Red Bull has struggled since Sebastian Vettel [former F1 Red Bull champion \u2013 ed.] went to the Ferrari team. So what would happen if Red Bull takes the last place? Would it hurt FuturoCoin?JW: The success of a team is always important. It rubs off on brand and vice versa. You want to be involved in a winning team. A successful team. The early signs are that the Red Bull\u2019s car is quite good this year. It is still very hard to read much from two weeks of testing. We will know more after the first race in Melbourne. I\u2019m sure Red Bull will be successful. They\u2019ve always been one of the top 3-4 teams, at least in the recent history of F1. I don\u2019t see any major reason why that would change in the next two years within FuturoCoin\u2019s partnership.CH: Red Bull has been one of three teams to win races recently. Aligning with winners is important. You need to aline with success. I\u2019m sure, with the partnership of FuturoCoin, Red Bull Racing will continue the path of success.So, let me twist that question. What will happen if Red Bull wins the championship? Does that make FuturoCoin even a bigger brand?CH: It certainly helps. As far of tv screens, they follow the winners, right? So, the more success the team has on the track, the more exposure of the brand is in the media as a byproduct of that. Success brings success, or at least success brings exposure. The reason why brands get into sponsorship is that they want to tell as many people as they can who they are, what they do. That is what the Red Bull platform would do to FuturoCoin. If Red Bull is successful, that will bring more opportunity to expose FTO.So, this sponsorship can only help FuturoCoin? There isn\u2019t any downside?CH: No, I don\u2019t think that there are any disadvantages to the deal. The negative outcome, to me, equals zero. You are in Formula One, so you\u2019re in Formula One. That\u2019s it. What can be wrong about it? The negative in business is not doing anything. If you are doing it, you\u2019re winning. FuturoCoin has already won."}

Turning Things AroundOKEx ended last year amid a deluge of criticism from angry traders. Not only was the Asian-turned-Malta-based exchange called out for market manipulation when it forced the early settlement of BCH futures, without warning, right before the fork, but it was also slammed for falsifying trading volume. However, the leading digital asset exchange that tells traders \u201cit\u2019s OK to be daring\u201d has put all that behind it \u2014 and its relentless efforts to beat BitMEX at its own game appear to be paying off. According to a media release, the company just registered a record-breaking 24-hour trading volume on crypto derivatives. OKEx racked up more trades than BitMEX or any other futures exchange, \u201ctopping the industry globally\u201d while trading $2.4 billion in one day. Just in case you were wondering where the numbers came from, the company reinforces this was \u201caccording to the official data.\u201dWho Trades on OKEx?At one point, it looked as if OKEx was going to see a mass exodus of traders from its platform. Now, it looks to have turned things around. The introduction of the latest perpetual swap product seems to have been a hit with futures traders, among whom some 56 percent go long on BTC.This, they say, reflects the market\u2019s overall optimism that the worst of the bearish conditions are over. Head of Operations Andy Cheung enthused:It is encouraging that traders are positive and open-minded to the future of cryptocurrency. This really strengthens our faith in going further. He also assured traders that the platform will continue to innovate and work on creating a more \u201ctrader-friendly\u201d environment. Contributing to the volume, OKEx\u2019s perpetual swap registered over $53 billion in total trading volume. It currently has nine different contract types available for trading \u2014 including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and EOS with 100x leverage, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Litecoin (LTC), and XRP with 40x leverage.Do you think OKEx really topped BitMEX?

Sure, I\u2019ve been in several \u2018content strategy meetings\u2019 where people have asked me questions like \u201cso who is your target audience?\u201d But for some reason they\u2019re rarely satisfied with the answer.eToro was founded with the simple goal to \u2018open the financial markets to everyone.With this in mind, we took a huge step towards that in San Fransisco yesterday by taking our first steps into the United States.Today is International Women\u2019s Day. Significant steps have already been taken to accelerate gender parity in the finance sector, but we think more needs to be done for more women to pursue their development in the space.Here\u2019s an initial blog post from earlier this week exploring how this could happen. A prime example of which can be found in this touching post by @Onegirl Lena Birse who has been successfully trading and teaching others to trade on eToro since 2014.Tomorrow is the 10-year anniversary of one of the longest stock bull runs in history. After the markets hit rock bottom on March 9th, 2009, very few people were privileged enough to take part in the wealth creation that ensued.So to answer the question. It\u2019s very simple. Everyone means everyone!!@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsThe Economy is like a Dark RoomNFP Day!Flippening a NocoinerPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of March 8th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsIn his speech yesterday, ECB Governor Mario Draghi used an interesting analogy to describe the European Central Bank\u2019s current strategy.He then proceeded to downgrade the Bank\u2019s growth and inflation forecasts and add yet another stimulus injection into the European economy.You can probably guess some of the factors he cited in order to arrive at the \u2018dark room\u2019 conclusion. Yup, that\u2019s right. Trade wars and Brexit.The Euro reacted accordingly, falling well below the support level of 1.1250 that we highlighted yesterday. In turn sparked a strong Dollar rally across the board, sending the stocks down with it.Here we can see the market reactions to Draghi\u2019s speech. The EURUSD falling below support (top left), the USD rising against emerging markets currencies (top right), oil apparently reversing course (bottom left), and the US stock market tanking (bottom right).Gold, on the other hand, did spike down during the speech, as you might expect on a stronger Dollar, but this morning it\u2019s reversing course due to the wider implications of the economy being in a dark room.Non-Farm PayrollsYes, it\u2019s that time of the month again. Jobs data will come out of the USA today are coming out today, one hour before the opening bell.Economists are forecasting that the US has added 180,000 jobs in February. A number that is pretty much in line with average with what the US has been doing for the past few years. The last two months have been much stronger than expected, adding 312k and 304k respectively. Another strong number today could very well put the Fed\u2019s patience policy into question.In other market affecting news\u2026.EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom managed to stop by the Bloomberg studio on her trip to Washington and recorded a startling interview where she pushed back on Trump\u2019s trade war and warned that any further tariffs would be met with tariffs of their own. Though sharp, she urged a message that globalization is in everyone\u2019s best interest. Catch the recording here.Later today, Theresa May will address the European Union and is expected to push the ball back into their court. The outcome deadlock is only getting stronger as we approach March 29th. Someone has to give and May\u2019s hoping it might be the EU.Flippening a NocoinerThe name Niall Ferguson carries a lot of weight in the financial world.

The altcoin dropped below the $160, $152 and $140 support to rest at the $130 support, which also aligns with the 23.6% fib retracement level. Currently, ETH price rests along the ascending trendline with support at 38.2% fib retracement level ($136.92) and a dip below this could see the altcoin revisit $130.

We take a look at the action and what it may mean moving into the weekly close. Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading the week within a $200 range with lows of $3700 established on Monday and highs of $3900 tested on Wednesday. Since then, the bulls have been peppering the upper $3800 range and have looked, generally, in control of the price action.4 Hour ChartLate on Friday, the bears smacked the price back down to just beyond the middle of the week\u2019s range, finding a low of \u00a33760 (-3.5 percent), which was bought back up \u2014 pushing the price to new weekly highs. This sort of unusual price action tends to occur preceding a more definitive move.The four-hour MACD is currently crossed bullish and trending above zero, which is in confluence with the stochastic RSI \u2014 which is also turned bullish. Combined with the general trend for the week being upward, the evidence at face value favors the bulls going into Saturday.Weekly ChartThe weekly chart shows that the volatility at these levels may somewhat be explained by the declining long-term resistance being very close to the current price. This price action just below at the 100 and 50 WMA cross, while being supported by the 200 WMA, is very similar to that which occurred in 2015.This took several months to resolve and ultimately led to a test of the declining 50WMA, which is currently declining from $6,000. It took 10 further weeks to test the 50 WMA following the cross under similar circumstances in 2015, which would take us to the end of April and somewhere in the $5,000 range. This test back in 2015 led to the 200 WMA being backchecked so, should this occur again, we would have clear battle lines drawn.The bearish case is that Bitcoin has failed to break this resistance for 12 months, so what would lead us to conclude that this time it may be different?Bulls Target $5KIn a TradingView post, I put forward the idea that a $5k Bitcoin price may be possible and that the main reasons behind this are that there are such a large number of bullish underlying indicators to support this notion, namely being the MAC-D, the CMF, Fibonacci levels, and the fact that we have made higher lows across a number of months.Only time will tell if this prediction will play out and it is a prediction against the grain of a 14-month bear market, so it should be treated with caution. A low beyond $3400 and a lower low / break in market structure would certainly imply that the bears are still in command after a short period of hibernation.Trade Bitcoin, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

Gox catastrophe, Cameron Winklevoss stated at the South by Southwest conference yesterday:There are a lot of carcasses on the road of crypto that we\u2019ve seen and learned from. At the end of the day it\u2019s really a trust problem. You need some kind of regulation to promote positive outcomes.He also stated that more oversight and regulatory compliance will push Bitcoin\u2019s price back to higher levels. \u201cYou want to have a couple of layers of checks and balances,\u201d Tyler Winklevoss said. \u201cWe are here for the long haul.\u201d When Winklevoss says \u201cyou,\u201d of course, we\u2019re not entirely sure he is talking about you. Some of us at Bitcoinist, for example, have no interest in having a couple of layers of checks and balances \u2014 and we, too, are in it for the long haul.What do you think of Cameron Winklevoss\u2019 statements?

The bank forecasts a whopping $19 billion in additional revenue from this initiative, alone. Barclays Bullish on \u2018FaceCoin\u2019Ross Sandler, an internet analyst at Barclays, said in a note to clients on Monday that Facebook\u2019s reported cryptocurrency could generate as much as $19 billion in additional revenue by 2021.As Bitcoinist reported in late 2018, the social media mogul is reportedly working on a stablecoin to allow WhatsApp users to transfer money. The company\u2019s initial focus is supposedly the remittance market in India.Sandler also pointed out that Facebook\u2019s intentions to get into payments is almost a decade old. However, back then, the major problem seemed to be that the company had to bear the interchange cost, \u201cwhich negatively impacts the profitability of the business, especially when making high volumes of lower-value transactions.\u201dPresently, however, both Facebook and the entire cryptocurrency sector have matured substantially.

Fidelity Becomes First Bank to Take the #LNTorchWith more than 27 million customers, Fidelity manages $7.2 trillion dollars in total assets. It\u2019s the United States leader in 401(k) retirement savings plans and is one of the largest 403(b) retirement plan providers for not-for-profit institutions.The investment giant announced it had received the #LNTorch on Friday, February 22nd from Tokyo-based and self-proclaimed \u2018Bitcoin Maximalist\u2019 who\u2019s \u201cinterested in mining/trading,\u201d Twitter user @Wiz who received it from Bitcoin entrepreneur, Charlie Shrem.\u201cWho wants to be the next torchbearer?\u201d tweeted Wiz. \u201cReply with a LN invoice for 3.64M sats and I\u2019ll choose who I deem to be the most trustworthy.\u201dThe 3.64 million satoshis equate to about $142 USD at current market BTC price.Fidelity Digital Assets then replied:We and our research team at the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology have received the #LNTorch from @Wiz.We and our research team at the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology have received the #LNTorch \u26a1from @Wiz.Who should we pass it to? #LNTrustChain https://t.co/JGcVoNQgBA\u2014 Fidelity Digital Assets (@DigitalAssets) February 22, 2019\u201cWho should we pass it to? #LNTrustChain,\u201d Fidelity asks, which is expected to launch its Bitcoin custody service next month.Fidelity Becomes 229th Torch BearerAs Bitcoinist reported, Lightning Torch has gained a surprising level of recognition in the few weeks it has existed. The initiative involves passing a lightning payment between nodes, with each receiving user adding 10,000 satoshis ($0.34) and passing on to a new node.Fidelity Digital Assets becomes the 229th entity overall to get the torch, according to the official tracker website. Previous bearers included BitMexResearch, Binance CEO \u2018CZ\u2019 Changpeng Zhao, and TRON\u2019s Justin Sun.But, more importantly, Fidelity becomes the first financial institution to get its hands on the digital \u2018torch.\u2019This may not be surprising, however, as Fidelity has been spearheading the institutional plunge into cryptocurrencies over the past few months. In October 2018, the investment giant announced it would open cryptocurrency trading to its 27 million customers.Therefore, participation in this payment relay will likely provide some valuable experience for Fidelity Digital assets that is looking \u201cto create a full-service enterprise-grade platform for digital assets,\u201d according to its founding head, Tom Jessop. He adds that:\u2026[f]amily offices, hedge funds and other sophisticated investors are starting to think seriously about this space.It will also be interesting to monitor whether this nascent, albeit rapidly growing second-layer network, will be able to handle the relayed BTC payment as it changes hands and snowballs.(Though, perhaps that may be the entire point of this whole thing, i.e. bringing awareness to this new technology as it\u2019s already producing some unique use-cases.)According to monitoring resource 1ML.com, there are currently 6561 reachable nodes and 29,777 channels on Lightning, offering a total payment capacity of 718.25 BTC ($2.85 million). The figures represent an impressive monthly growth of 26 percent in network capacity.Will Elon Musk Be Next?Bitcoinist reported that participants in the ongoing transaction relay have been urging Tesla CEO Elon Musk to paste an invoice and receive the torch.This follows after Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey became the bearer to much fanfare earlier this month while hinting that Bitcoin Lightning payments may be coming to Twitter.

The whole world is waiting to see which direction the United States will take and Korea is particularly susceptible.The clock is running on the new Bitwise & VanEck bitcoin ETF proposals. The SEC's current deadlines are April 1 for Bitwise & April 6 for VanEck.Remember, the SEC can & likely will delay up to three times. The absolute final deadlines to watch are October 13 & 18 respectively.\u2014 Jake Chervinsky (@jchervinsky) February 20, 2019Of course, as we\u2019ve seen so far, dates put out by the SEC are far from set in stone. Decisions on Bitcoin ETFs have been delayed time after time (and will likely be delayed into October 2019). And the markets react negatively with each additional dragging of the heels. Cryptocurrency is extremely sensitive to decisions by the SEC. Approval of a Bitcoin ETF would effectively mean U.S. regulators are giving a nod to the legitimacy of Bitcoin. This would be very bullish for the market\u2013particularly in Korea, which is at somewhat of a standstill when it comes to regulation.Korea Leading the Way on Blockchain AdoptionWell-known for its high level of tech savviness, South Korea quickly became a key world economy. It\u2019s home to powerhouse companies like Samsung and LG. Despite cautious regulation on cryptocurrencies so far, with the original banning of ICOs, regulators are beginning to thaw.In fact, the Korean government recently allocated 1 trillion won (USD $880 million) to blockchain development for 2019.Moreover, Korea makes up a massive 30 percent of all cryptocurrency trading globally, with some 30 percent of all salaried workers owning crypto assets of some kind. But analysts believe that a nod from the SEC on Bitcoin ETFs will really be the starting gun in this Asian country. Quoted in the Korea Herald, Lee Kyung-ho, a professor at Korea University\u2019s Graduate School of Information Security said:With the government expanding its investment in research and development of blockchain technology, the projects are expected to minimize or eliminate the risk of integrating ETF transactions in the cryptocurrency market.Why Are Bitcoin ETFs So Important?Many people see Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds as a less risky way of investors entering the market. This is because they allow investors to get \u2018skin in the game\u2019 without having to invest in Bitcoin itself. They can access the entire portfolio of a fund through traditional channels that they are comfortable with. They also won\u2019t have the risks associated with storing their funds correctly. Moreover, as Lee pointed out, for cryptocurrency exchanges to trade Bitcoin ETFs, they will need to have adequate KYC and AML checks in place. This should weed out the bad actors and\u2013in theory\u2013rejuvenate the cryptocurrency market in Korea.Will a Bitcoin ETF approval in the US boost Korea\u2019s cryptocurrency industry?

By 2022, he previously claimed, BTC/USD would reach $250,000 per coin, one of the highest predictions to emerge from the industry.

Amongst other things, they discussed philosophy, philanthropy, and \u201chow the world works\u201d.The Cee-Zee Way OutBinance sprang from seemingly nowhere to become the biggest crypto-exchange in the world. But CZ puts that largely down to their international outlook. A career working around the globe taught him that individual currencies are limited to one country.When Binance launched, most players were focussing on the larger fiat markets, or just trying to crack crypto-to-crypto in the US. Binance settled on the smaller crypto market but multiplied that by 180 countries.Regarding the speed of Binance\u2019s growth and development, CZ explains that getting the right team solved a lot of the issues in scaling so quickly. The company does not make long-term plans, just weekly plans, which leads to the fast implementation of new ideas.How The World WorksTrading in 180 different countries, means 180 different sets of (generally still unclear) regulations. Rather than try to dictate or influence these, the CZ way is to work within them. However, he has strong views on where regulation must focus:regulations should try to prevent bad actors but not limit industry growthWhen the industry learns how to deal with scams, CZ believes fundraising (through ICOs) will return. He says this is one of the most valid use-cases for blockchain, stressing the importance of entrepreneurs (and supporting their development through the Binance Labs investment arm) in making the world a better place.CZ is not anti-establishment, hoping to redefine how the world should work, he just wants to make better solutions for \u201chow the world works.\u201dGive It Away, Give It Away, Give It Away NowWhen asked about his philanthropy, CZ admits that it is a little bit self-serving, in that he is using social impact work to promote crypto. While the projects themselves are rewarding, giving the next generation a positive first interaction with crypto is also key.CZ explains that he has enough money, and doubling or halving it would not change his life very much. After taking care of yourself, he believes that the most fulfilling life involves taking care of others. He wants to achieve something impactful and says he believes that:increasing adoption of crypto is most positive impact I can bring to our speciesThink About The FutureCZ thinks that Binance is already covering enough in terms of initiatives, but wants to go deeper into each one. He says Binance doesn\u2019t have to do everything, but:want(s) to be the infrastructure player for a few things out of many and\u2026 want(s) to do them well.Interestingly, the price of Binance token (BNB) 00 has just hit a fresh all-time high against BTC.What do you think of CZ\u2019s comments?

The hedge fund manager also believes that the cryptocurrency industry needs a comprehensive cleanup to remove \u2018bad actors\u2019 and enhance mainstream investor confidence in the fledgling market.Bitcoin Price Yet to Bottom OutSince falling from an all-time high of $19,700 in mid-December 2017, to $6,000 at the start of February 2018, establishing a long-term bottom for Bitcoin price continues to be a prominent topic of discussion. For Sunnarborg, BTC isn\u2019t quite there yet.Speaking to Forbes\u2019 Jeff Kauflin, the Tetras Capital managing partner commented on the question of Bitcoin bottoming out, saying:I don\u2019t think so, and I think calling that is very difficult [\u2026] One way to think about the bottom is that it happens when all the bad news gets washed out. At that point the only thing to do is go up, and you can\u2019t really talk about any negative catalysts anymore, because they\u2019ve all happened.According to Sunnarborg, BTC price is close to establishing a long-term bottom. However, the hedge fund manager says the market requires some degree of clarity, either way, to speed up the bottoming process.During the interview, Sunnarborg identified the VanEck/SolidX Bitcoin ETF proposal as something that could have accelerated the bottoming process if it had been rejected. For Sunnarborg, there are too many variables up in the air including potential launches (Fidelity, Bakkt) and ETF approvals, which could be catalysts for the actual Bitcoin bottom.In late January 2019, Fidelity announced that its custody platform would launch in March 2019. Bakkt is still awaiting approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) but the company says it is going ahead with all the necessary preparations.Crypto Industry Needs a CleanupCommenting on the industry as a whole, Sunnaborg opined that the market needed a cleanup to become more appealing to mainstream investors and the need for trusted trading data.Recently, Nasdaq partnered with Brave New Coin (BNC) to include Bitcoin and Ethereum price indices developed by BNC in the former\u2019s trading index catalog. Sunnarborg says crypto data needs to become more trustworthy to combat instances of price manipulation.Speaking on the issue of an industry-wide cleanup, Sunnaborg stated:I would love to see the SEC come down on people really hard. One of the biggest problems in this space is there are so many bad actors, and so many were related to ICOs. The SEC just has such a massive task ahead of them.1/ I spoke with @alexsunnarborg from Tetras Capital\u2014the crypto fund that shorted ether last spring, when it was above $500\u2014and he thinks the crypto market hasn\u2019t bottomed yet: https://t.co/7RChyNn9Nl.

Users can install the Binance Chain app through Ledger Live in order to access the DEX testnet with the Ledger Nano S.The DEX interface feels very similar to the Binance platform.Binance has also revealed a blockchain explorer for the testnet of Binance Chain. Via the explorer, users can find information about blocks which are added to the network, wallet balances, as well as transactions which have taken place on the blockchain among other things.How Decentralized Will it Really Be?CEO \u2018CZ\u2019 Changpeng Zhao has more than once expressed his position on decentralization, outlining that it\u2019s not safer \u2018by default\u2019 compared to centralized solutions. He also said \u2018there is no absolute decentralization.\u2019 So the DEX differs is a non-custodial exchange, but takes it a step further since the orders are matched by the blockchain and not the exchange.Earlier this month, Bitcoinist reported on a live AMA of Binance\u2019s CEO, where he outlined that, initially, the number of network consensus validators on the DEX is going to be small \u2013 starting with 11 validator nodes.During the AMA, Zhao outlined that as the exchange goes live, they will be looking to select the nodes through their close partners. He also stated that Binance will have a lot of influence over the network, saying that the solution will be \u201cmore centralized\u201d in comparison to other networks.Additionally, Zhao also said that Binance DEX will charge \u201cclose to $100K\u201d for listing new cryptocurrencies in an attempt to reduce the number of \u201cspam or scam projects.\u201dBinance Coin (BNB) Pumping on The NewsIn anticipation for the testnet launch, BNB 00 surged with over 13 percent in the last 24 hours.The cryptocurrency has reached a new all-time high (ATH) value when trading against BTC.Earlier this week, Binance said that BNB will be moved to the Binance Chain, converting it into a native asset.

BTC/USD 00 hit a high of around $3960 on major exchanges, before a slight reversal took the pair to just above $3850.

This news comes amid the public rollout of the .dev top-level domain (TLD).$12,500 for Bitcoin.devIf you were eyeing ownership of bitcoin.dev while waiting for Google to release the new TLD officially, that chance is long gone. A redditor with the name \u201csalsa-system\u201d posted a couple of hours ago that Google has registered both the bitcoin.dev and blockchain.dev domains on Tuesday (February 19, 2019).This news means that someone splashed $12,500 to lock down the .dev domain for the top-ranked cryptocurrency. That\u2019s $25,000 in total if the same entity also acquired blockchain.dev.As at press time, a quick check on the registry shows that ethereum.dev is unavailable but addresses like satoshi.dev and btc.dev haven\u2019t been claimed yet. Like in other business segments, prime domain names are also highly sought after in the cryptocurrency ecosystem..dev TLD Now AvailableThe news comes as Google, the owners of the .dev domain announced the public release of the new TLD in a blog post published on Tuesday. According to the statement, individuals and companies alike can utilize the early access program to acquire their preferred .dev domain names.An excerpt from the announcement reads:We hope .dev will be a new home for you to build your communities, learn the latest tech and showcase your projects-all with a perfect domain name.Entities who chose to register their domains names on the day of the launch paid $12,500 in total fees. Those electing to do so today, Wednesday (January 20, 2019) will pay $3,500. By the end of February, getting a .dev domain will cost $20.Making .dev Public AgainCurrently, platforms and organizations like GitHub, Salesforce, and JetBrains are already using the new TLD. According to Google, the .dev domain is for developers and coders.This admission by the company might in some way be an attempt to appease developers. In 2015, Google\u2019s acquisition of the .dev TLD caused an uproar from stakeholders in the industry.At the time, developers used the domain for their internal website testing protocols. This situation became even further exacerbated when a couple of years later, the company took the domain private, causing test webpages to stop working.In any case, it seems like Google is starting to dip its toes into Bitcoin.

But the metric used to compare exchanges (daily trade volumes) is open to abuse and manipulation. New research from Hacken System\u2019s Crypto Exchange Ranks (CER) suggests a more accurate ranking method.In the rampant bull market of 2017, crypto exchanges appeared to have developed into significant players in global finance. Billions of dollars of daily traded volume fuelled investors confidence that they had bought into something huge. But centralized crypto exchanges display the polar opposite of the transparency that we hold so dear in Bitcoin.These impenetrable black boxes of power, completely conceal the way they operate, store customer assets, and make profit. The preferred method for ranking exchanges became the (often self-reported) daily trade volumes, which poses obvious issues.Techniques such as wash-trading allow exchanges to manipulate this metric, enabling unproven new exchanges to emerge at the top of the CoinMarketCap rankings. So how can we grade the exchanges\u2019 genuine sustainability and liquidity?All Aboard, The BlockchainThe solution, according to Hacken, is in the blockchain itself. As an immutable ledger we can rely on the information recorded.Therefore, the only trustworthy data about the exchanges available now resides in their cold and hot wallet balances. This information may not be falsified and can be easily verified. Likewise, anyone can observe the wallets of a particular exchange and track all their changes and movements.This also compares to client deposits in traditional banks, reflecting the level of liabilities for each. Despite the billions of dollars in reported trade volumes, exchanges fall far behind banks when considering this metric.Don\u2019t Believe The HypeHacken compared data from the five largest US and UK banks, five local banks in emerging countries, and the five largest crypto-exchanges (according to wallet balances).The wallet balances of the exchanges are not even visible in the chart compared to the top five US and UK banks. Even taking these banks out of the equation, and just considering the five local banks in emerging nations paints a sobering picture.On average the crypto-trading platforms lag behind local bank deposits by a factor of 15. And their wallet balances hold over 1000 times less than the top five global banks.These figures may look depressing compared to the billion dollar volumes we have been fed in the past. But for cryptocurrencies to grow (and there is still a lot of that needed to achieve a truly global scale), it is important to have accurate data to rely on.Perhaps now we can put the hype behind us, and concentrate on the measured and sustainable growth of the industry.What do you think about these findings?

This assessment derives from the marginal cost of producing Bitcoin, but some disagree with Chinese miners\u2019 production cost estimations.The Price Of DystopiaIn the report, JPMorgan analysts claimed that the \u201caverage cash cost of a low-cost Chinese miner was around US$2,400 per bitcoin\u201d in Q4 2018.This, they suggested, is the break-even point; the marginal cost of producing one bitcoin. With bitcoin currently hovering around the $4000 mark, that represents a price drop of 40% before achieving \u2018fair value\u2019.This actually seemed like progress from the previous day, when a JPMorgan analyst claimed bitcoin only had value in a dystopian environment. Unless the suggestion is that we are already living in a dystopian environment?The Fallacy Of MetricsAnyway, miners argued that the design of Bitcoin means that the very concept of an average \u2018marginal cost\u2019 was flawed. Ben Gagnon, co-founder of mining hardware developer, LuTech explained that there could be no \u2018average cost\u2019 or \u2018break-even point\u2019.With a finite supply of around 1800 bitcoin per day, a miner can only get a bigger share of that relative to other miners. As Gagnon says:\u2026there will always be miners seeking to create blocks and get bitcoin rewards so long as they can operate with power-efficient hardware at low electricity cost\u2026 When bitcoin price falls, the cost of mining a bitcoin will also fall, as miners with more expensive operations will be the one to exit the market first. This leaves room for more market share and profitability to lower-cost minersValuation MotivationPerhaps JPMorgan are unhappy with the statistic that they hold 200 times more customer deposit value than the top five cryptocurrency exchanges combined?A bitcoin price of $2400 would increase this to over 300 times the value, even if the exchanges holdings were spread evenly across all available tokens. The fact that the majority of tokens held by the exchanges are bitcoin, would make this gap even wider.And one wonders how JPMorgan would value its own recently unveiled JPM coin? Presumably centralised, it would not require mining, therefore the \u2018marginal cost\u2019 of production per coin would be\u2026Zero?Do you agree with JPMorgan\u2019s valuation of bitcoin?

The project has seen high-profile participation and ongoing advocacy from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, and community members hope that Musk will follow in his footsteps.

According to a new eToro survey of 1000 online traders, 43 percent of millennial online traders place more trust in cryptocurrency exchanges than the United States stock market. On the flip side, the vast majority of Gen X respondents feel the opposite.Millennials that trade crypto unsurprisingly have more trust in the nascent asset class than the stock market, but one-third of millennials that don\u2019t trade cryptocurrencies responded that they also trust crypto over the stock market.Guy Hirsch, Managing Director of eToro U.S., sees this as a clear \u201cgeneration shift.\u201d He stated via press release:We\u2019re seeing the beginning of a generational shift in trust from traditional stock exchanges to crypto exchanges. At the heart of this change are the asset classes themselves. Younger investors\u2019 experience with the stock market has seen a great deal of loss of trust, with the fall of Lehman Brothers because of irresponsible practices followed by the worst recession since the Great Depression. Trust further eroded when Americans saw how hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayers money are funneled to the largest financial institutions while their savings evaporated and how banks get free money through quantitative easing while their cost of living continued to rise.When it\u2019s all said and done, millennials are likely more tuned in to Bitcoin\u2019s principles of decentralization, immutability, and trustless nature \u2014 none of which helps bad actors in the traditional financial space conduct corrupt financial practices off-the-books. Explains Hirsch:Immutability is native to blockchains and that makes real-time audit to be sensible and cost-effective and that is why Millennials and Gen X perceive crypto exchanges as less likely to be subject to manipulation and less likely to be a place where bad actors get rewarded with taxpayer money. As more investors become educated on the benefits of blockchain we\u2019ll continue to see this trend play out.What do you think about millennials\u2019 interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies over the traditional stock market?

With transaction per second on the rise, the top-ranked cryptocurrency is also experiencing a resurgence in both actual use, especially in emerging markets, and interest as seen in the latest Google search trends.Rising Bitcoin Transaction RateData from Blockchain shows that Bitcoin\u2019s transaction rate is currently at 3.8 transactions per second (TPS). The figure represents the highest BTC transaction rate since its all-time high of 4.7 in mid-December 2017.After the initial price crash of February 2018 that took BTC price to $6,000 the transaction rate also fell. However, since then, BTC\u2019s TPS count has been rising steadily.Despite the steady increase, transaction fees have remained relatively stable on the lower end of the spectrum. In 2017, as the daily transaction volume rose, so did the average fees paid to miners also increase.By the time of the eye-catching bull rally in late 2017, fees had topped $50 on the average, a massive increase from sub-$1 levels before the surge. The fact that BTC transaction volume without any corresponding hike in fees shows that capacity-boosting upgrades like SegWit are having an effect.Last month, Bitcoinist also reported that Bitcoin daily on-chain transaction volume has also reached the highest level since the 2017 price peak.Bitcoin Popularity Staging a ComebackBitcoin\u2019s TPS isn\u2019t the only thing on the rise related to the top-ranked cryptocurrency at the moment.

The 1-hour chart shows the altcoin appears ready to attack the $147 and $149 resistance where ETH recently rejected a number of times.

A drop below $140 could open the door to steep losses over the coming session but this seems unlikely at the moment. Barring some unexpected bug discovery, the Constantinople hardfork is still scheduled to occur between the 25th and 28th of February so there is the possibility of increased activity in the days before the event occurs.

However, many of the articles seem to miss the point of what Elon was really saying. For those who would like to know, here\u2019s the link to the interview, the comments about crypto come at the very end (timestamp 25:25).What became clear to me was that Elon wasn\u2019t very interested in talking about it all. Though he did his best to pivot back to Tesla, the interviewer Tasha Keeney did her best to keep him on it. At which point he simply stated some of the obvious pros and cons of digital assets. Responding on twitter just a few moments ago he wrote\u2026So, the guys got one foot in and one foot out. Far from a critic but not an advocate either.Certainly, if Musk wanted to come out as a crypto fan he could have taken the Lightening Torch as his friend Jack has done (discussed in a previous market update titled: Sudden Change in Outlook). In fact, the CEO of Twitter and Square has wandered further down the crypto rabbit hole today by trying out the new lightening powered tip bot tippin.me.The XRP community was quick to point out that sending tips on Twitter has been available for some time through the @xrptipbot. As someone who\u2019s sent and received tips through both apps, I can say that they\u2019re both easy to use and neither seems to have any particular edge over the other.Tipping content creators is arguably one of the most mainstream use cases for internet money, the custom has been alive and thriving in China for more than a decade already. The only difference is that in the East, it\u2019s more of a closed ecosystem that was set up by Tencent, and I\u2019m thrilled to see that as it catches on in the West, people are integrating with some of the top cryptos.@MatiGreenspaneToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsUS-China trade deadline: 8 days | Days to Brexit: 36US Dollar Effect on the MarketsCrypto ConsolidationPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of February 21st. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsThe FOMC release last night did in fact turn heads yesterday as the Fed indicated they\u2019re going to leave the balance sheet alone for now, but the pace of rising interest rates was still very much in question.By this passage in the FOMC\u2019s meeting minutes, highlighted by Business Insider, we can see that the Fed is very conscientious of the impact they\u2019re having on financial markets, which is arguably the main reason for their sudden shift in policy.Stock markets are struggling to find a direction this morning. Both the Asian and the European session are returning mixed results as the US futures struggle to hold their gains.Following January\u2019s great recovery, there seem to be lingering questions among analysts about global growth and whether rising wages might start eating into corporate profits.USD EffectThe United States Dollar has pulled back a bit from the highs, yet still remains resilient around its mid-range (dotted white line). The rising channel (yellow lines) is strong but some think that this pullback is only short term as it builds up enough strength to break through the psychological barrier at 97.25 (blue line).Given the Fed\u2019s new policy, it would make sense for the Dollar to weaken. However, this hasn\u2019t happened at all. In fact, the opposite. This could be due to the fact that all of the other central banks are also taking simultaneous measures to weaken their own respective currencies.This could also be why we\u2019ve seen the Dollar\u2019s drop this morning met with a drop in Gold. The two usually move opposite each other, so to see them traveling the same direction today is a rather rare sight.This move did occur while Europe was putting out fairly strong PMI data. So a more positive sentiment there puts the reaction in a bit better context of course.Crypto ConsolidationAfter the strong rally that we saw in the crypto markets this week, it wouldn\u2019t at all be surprising to see some sort of pullback or consolidation. Though it\u2019s clear such a pullback would be disappointing to some.Putting the rally into further context, I\u2019d like to zoom in on our descending wedge that we\u2019ve been tracking for the past few weeks. For now, the market seems to be flirting heavily with the $4,000 level (doted white line).Volumes have tapered off slightly to about $28 billion over the last 24 hours. Still much higher than the $15 billion it was at just two weeks ago. This is a good sign that crypto traders are watching closely at the moment as the battle royale for $4k plays out.Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalysteToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

Now, BTG Pactual, Latin America\u2019s largest standalone investment bank, is launching a security token of its own.A Wave of Change in BrazilThere seems to be a wave of change happening in Brazil. Bitcoinist reported just a few days ago that Santander Bank was ordered by a Court to keep open Bitcoin Max\u2019 checking account. Banks that were once hesitant to work with cryptocurrency exchanges are being forced to eat humble pie. That marked a small victory for the cryptocurrency space in this part of the world. And now, it seems that financial institutions here are realizing the worth of digital assets within their own portfolios. Banco BTG Pactual SA Is Leading the WayBrazil\u2019s Banco BTG Pactual, the largest standalone investment bank in the region, has announced that it will be entering the cryptocurrency space with its own security token, the ReitBZ.With a plan to raise up to $15 million in its token sale, STO, initial offering, or whatever terminology you prefer, the bank will launch a security token backed by distressed real estate assets in Brazil. The ReitBZ token will use blockchain technology. And investors will be able to buy it using the Winklevoss twins\u2019 Gemini Dollar or ETH. The token is indisputably a security token since investors will receive dividends periodically from the recovery of the distressed assets.Hold Up, What Are Distressed Assets?A distressed asset is one that is put on sale at a reduced price because its owner has been forced to sell it. This may be due to excessive debt, bankruptcy, or regulatory constraints. And it\u2019s especially common when it comes to real estate, a market in which during times of financial crises, people often fail to make their mortgage payments.Distressed assets are an excellent opportunity to buy into a devalued asset and make gains as the market recovers. They\u2019re not so awesome for the person forced to sell, of course, but this is capitalism, after all.The BTG distressed real estate assets will be managed by a BTG subsidiary called Enforce. The ReitBZ token will be available worldwide. With the notable exception of the U.S. (surprise, surprise), and Brazil.Wait, so investors around the world will be able to profit from the rising housing crisis in Brazil\u2013but not the Brazilian people themselves? Right. How\u2019s that for messed up? BTG, however, assures that once the regulatory landscape clears up in Brazil, the ReitBZ will be open to its country\u2019s citizens and maybe even the United States as well.The Opportunity for High Yearly ReturnsAccording to the bank, investors can expect yearly returns from these assets between 15-20 percent. Moreover, BTG will be providing market-making services for its token to ensure that investors have sufficient liquidity to sell when they want to. CTO Gustavo Roxo told Bloomberg:BTG is deploying its own capital to provide liquidity because it really believes in the crypto business\u2026 We came up with this structure because we think investors in the digital world have a higher risk-taking appetite.By using a crypto asset, BTG can maximize returns from its distressed assets and allow investors to enter the market in a cheaper way. The initial sale period of ReitBZ will last for approximately 90 days and proceeds will be reinvested into the portfolio.Banks and Cryptocurrencies Starting to Gain MomentumThe announcement comes off the back of the news last week that JPMorgan became the first U.S. bank to launch its own \u2018cryptocurrency.\u2019With CEO Jamie Dimon well-known for \u2018Bitcoin bashing\u2019, JPMorgan introducing its own digital coin to accelerate payments was a shock to many in the industry.However, JPMorgan and BTG are not the only horses in this race. It seems that the banks haven\u2019t been falling asleep at the wheel when it comes to cryptocurrency after all. Japanese Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group started working on plans for their own token back in 2016. And now Brazil has stepped up to the plate.BTG\u2019s partner and initiative head of the ReitBZ Andre Portilho said:We knew we needed to dominate this technology, so we started experimenting with it a few years back\u2026 We thought Bitcoin and other currencies were turning too volatile, but we saw an opportunity with this token to try something new\u2013but also with our skin in the game.The question now isn\u2019t whether other banks will launch their own digital currencies, but rather which ones?Will more banks follow with their own virtual currency?

He also thinks that a cryptocurrency of the kind would facilitate traceability, verifying the origin of each barrel of oil without any additional costs.Following In The Footsteps of Venezuela?Russia\u2019s plan sounds awfully lot like that of Venezuela\u2019s Petro. The Petro is a cryptocurrency, supposedly tied to Venezuela\u2019s mineral resources, including oil.

For more than a decade the African nation has been relying on a multi-currency system that relies heavily on the US Dollar. However, in a country of 16 million people, there aren\u2019t always enough dollar bills to go around. Talk about a liquidity issue.So most Zimbabweans receive their monthly paycheck by electronic transfer to their bank account, which they then need to figure out how to spend in the grocery store.In 2016 the government issued a new currency called a bond note, the exchange rate of which has been controlled by the government. In a recent update, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has ditched capital controls and is now allowing bond notes to trade according to the free market.In a country that has full mobile penetration, it\u2019s really a wonder to me how cryptocurrencies are not playing a larger role.Hint hint, wink wink, to Dash, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsUS-China trade deadline: 7 days | Days to Brexit: 35Crypto Changing LandscapeEthereum\u2019s Rate of InflationPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of February 22nd. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsStocks pulled back a bit yesterday but this morning investors are looking to reverse the losses. We\u2019ve been counting down on geopolitical timers for so long that many market participants are already dreaming of a day when those counters get to zero and all is resolved.The tricky one remains Brexit. At this point, analysts have identified three possible yet unlikely outcomes.1. No deal Brexit 2. Theresa May\u2019s deal, or some variation 3. A time extensionEach of the above seems to be extremely unlikely yet we know that one of them has to happen. Should option one materialize, it\u2019s very likely that the British Pound will fall, and in the event of option two, the Pound should rise.The Pound has been falling pretty steadily since May. Here we can see the GBPJPY kissing her 200-day moving average (blue line).Also, the New York session today should be really interesting as we\u2019ll hear from a slew of central bankers including Mario Draghi and no less than four Fed members as well as receiving a monetary policy report from the Fed.Remember, these are the guys who drive the markets. So it pays to pay attention.SEC WatchersJust as traders in traditional markets watch the Fed, cryptotraders seem to be forming a habit of watching the SEC.Today, we got some pretty astonishing news that an ICO called Gladius Network LLC received a pass from the SEC despite them selling $12.7 million worth of unregistered securities tokens. This is quite a different outcome than the SEC took with Paragon and Airfox just three months ago, who each needed to pay a fine of a quarter million dollars.While the SEC is the most important regulatory body in the United States when it comes to securities, other regulators may be influencing policy as well. Our US Managing Director Guy Hirsch wrote me this morning\u2026How about the Crypto Rally?Well, excitement is still high but seems to be fading. Volumes did peak out at $35 billion during the full moon on Tuesday, February 19th. Today we\u2019re down to $23 billion traded across global crypto exchanges.Some have pointed to the volumes on Wall Street\u2019s bitcoin futures, provided by the CME group, which reached a new record high of 18,338 contracts during Tuesday\u2019s madness. That comes out to a total volume of approximately $357 million, or approximately 1% of the amount traded on exchanges.Also, the major price surge actually happened on Monday, when the CME was closed for President\u2019s day. So, it\u2019s clear that Wall Street is the passenger here and not driving.So, to find out whether this rally is about to continue or claw back we need to look at the root. As we\u2019ve been discussing, this entire rally seems to have been caused by a shortage in the supply of new Ethereum.Historically, the Ethereum network produces about 20,000 to 30,000 new ETH per day. However, since the beginning of the year the amounts have been tapering off and as of last week, the new supply was more like 13,000 per day.The Constantinople upgrade which is currently scheduled for block height 7,280,000 (approximately February 27th), is supposed to stabilize supply to about 5,700 blocks per day and reduce the block reward from 3 ETH to 2 ETH per block. So, by these metrics, we can deduce that new production after the fork will be about 11,400. Far less than the current rate mentioned above.Now, another part of Constantinople is that it\u2019s supposed to reduce the amount of gas needed per transaction. However, it\u2019s not apparent how the new gas fee structure will affect demand.So even though we know supply will be reduced drastically, we don\u2019t know if this will affect bottom line inflation because we don\u2019t know exactly what demand will look like under the new system.Clearly, forward guidance on monetary policy is not the largest concern for Ethereum\u2019s community leaders. As far as the rest of the crypto market, this recent rally certainly has the big fish nibbling. We\u2019ve been in the accumulation zone for a while now and this latest push off the floor might just be enough to bring the market out of a slump, but there are several technical levels that need to be broken before that happens.Wishing you an awesome weekend!Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalysteToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

It has an IPO pending with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, having updated its prospectus last December.Hong Kong financial regulations require a \u2018quiet period\u2019 around an IPO when insiders are not allowed to release company information. Therefore Ebang could not confirm or deny the reported unit production figure for 2019.Dominant player, Bitmain, also has an IPO application pending with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which it filed in September 2018. Rumors arose that this was in jeopardy due to massive Q3 2018 losses. It remains to be seen how these plans develop as Bitmain this week unveiled a new 7nm ASIC chip.Second largest manufacturer, Canaan, meanwhile was the first to attempt an IPO listing in Hong Kong, although it eventually allowed this to lapse.

Thailand to Greenlight STOsThailand\u2019s National Legislative Assembly has reportedly approved an amendment to the existing Securities and Exchange Act on February 8th, according to the Bangkok Post.The amended act is expected to go into effect this year according to Tipsuda Thavaramara, Deputy Secretary-General at the SEC. The Director of the Corporate Communication Department at the SEC, Pariya Techamuanvivit, said that once this happens, it will be legal for businesses to launch security token offerings using blockchain technology. She also outlined that the Commission will be able to provide legal clarity on whether or not certain securities can be issued as digital tokens.Furthermore, the rights and the obligations which are associated with the digital token, subject of the STO, will determine whether or not it will be regulated under the Securities and Exchange Act and the Royal Decree on Digital Assets. The decree holds that if a financial instrument, i.e. digital token, fits the definition of a security, then it will be regulated under the act. It\u2019s worth noting that last year Thailand established rules which put clear definitions for the terms \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d and \u201cdigital token\u201d, hence ending the currency vs. security token debate. Per the rules, \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d are used as a medium for exchanging goods. \u201cDigital tokens\u201d on the other hand, are defined as rights to take part in an investment. Additional ChangesFurthermore, the amended act will also allow businesses to obtain licenses to operate as depositories of securities and digital tokens. This is something that was previously allowed only for the Thailand Securities Depository Co Ltd, a subsidiary of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). Bitcoinist reported earlier this year that Thailand\u2019s stock exchange (SET) is considering to apply for a digital asset operating licenses with the Thai Finance Ministry.

In the short term, the researchers found the validity of the law to be \u201cquestionable.\u201d Metcalfe\u2019s Law Only Good For The Long TermA new study called Metcalfe\u2019s law and herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market, authored by Danial Traian Pele and Miruna Mazurency-Marinescu-Pele has confirmed that Metcalfe\u2019s law may only apply to Bitcoin\u2019s network in the long term.The law stipulates that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system.The researchers analyzed blockchain data from 2010 to 2018 and their results also showed potential for herding behavior. This is why they also used Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model to determine the behavior of cryptocurrency exchange rates during bubble periods and to eventually predict the most probable time of a regime switch.Ultimately, the researchers came to the following conclusion:The results show, in the medium to long-run, the validity of Metcalfe\u2019s law (the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system) for the evaluation of cryptocurrencies; however, in the short-run, the validity of Metcalfe\u2019s law for Bitcoin is questionable.Metcalfe\u2019s Law and BitcoinIn order to evaluate how and if Metcalfe\u2019s law applies for Bitcoin\u2019s network, the researchers looked at the number of unique Bitcoin addresses and their progression through the time of the study.(Though node count would probably be another metric worth studying.)As seen in the picture above, the number of unique addresses in Bitcoin\u2019s network has generally been growing in an upward trajectory until the end of 2017.Bitcoin\u2019s price, on the other hand, for the most part, has been moving sideways. It catches up eventually towards the end of 2017 as well and decreases with the number of unique addresses in the following year.This shows that while Metcalfe\u2019s law might not be applicable for the short term, it does eventually apply.What do you think of the recent findings regarding Metcalfe\u2019s law applicability to Bitcoin\u2019s value?

Or alternatively, included things CZ hadn\u2019t thought of but now intends to implement. For a company which, the CEO insists, makes no long-term plans, this could, therefore, give a rare insight into future direction.Utility Tokens\u2026 or Securities?$BNB tokens current value derives partly from their utility within the Binance ecosystem. They act as staking tokens, discount tokens, and payment tokens, offering several benefits to Binance users who hold them.Additionally, Binance use 20% of quarterly profits to buy-back and burn $BNB, in a mechanism somewhat analogous to share buyback. Whilst the token is not a typical company share, this could denote it a security, depending on whose definition.But according to Multicoin Capital, the under-valuation also relates to its potential within Binance Chain, the company\u2019s decentralised exchange platform.We believe that Binance will be the first for-profit corporation to start out centralized, achieve meaningful scale, and ultimately decentralize itself to become the first internet-sovereign organization, and the largest decentralized autonomous corporation (DAC).When Binance announced their decentralised exchange, it claimed that \u201cBinance will transition from being a company to a community.\u201dMulticoin Capital expect this to mean that the value created by Binance DEX, will flow towards $BNB, rather than Binance equity.Initially, the decentralized exchange will likely eat into the market share of the centralized offering. However, over a time-period of several years, we may see the majority of transactions migrate to the DEX platform.Due to the nature of exchanges, natural market equilibrium tends towards one dominant player, and Binance are well-placed to fulfil that role. The company\u2019s greatest risk was that a decentralised exchange might rise up and take its prize. With the upcoming launch of Binance Chain, this risk is mitigated.What do you think of Binance coin (BNB)?

Bitcoinist | Feb 23, 2019 | 00:00 Share Tweet Send Share Social Trading ImpactMastering trading techniques and strategies involves great risks, especially if a trader has very low or no previous experience. Constantly following and analyzing news and market trends as well as using advanced charting tools and following up with market signals can be overwhelming for newcomers and work as a push-away factor. Social trading, on the other hand, provides a more straightforward approach and allows beginner users to start closing profitable trades and earn profits from day one.The basis of social trading begins with a feature to copy the trades of other users. With no past trading experience, users can copy the trading strategies of others and benefit from their knowledge and expertise.Why care about copying trading strategies?Among a number of outstanding features in social trading, the copy trading feature provides the best effort-outcome ratio. Copy trading enables professional and newbie traders to benefit from the proven track records of seasoned traders by merely copying their trades. The results of this feature are two-fold: first, it alleviates the lack of experience that prevents newcomers from increasing their initial capital by making winning trades. Second, it is the quickest way to build one\u2019s personal trading strategy without encountering much loss on the way. All being said, copy trading is one of the most invaluable perks of social trading that allows traders to better manage their trading portfolio.However, despite the proclaimed simplicity of use, copy trading may seem somewhat entangled, especially when it comes to earning bonuses from getting copied.Is it easy to earn bonuses when stock trading?NAGA Trader, a German social trading platform, for example, has updated its award bonus structure for users whose traders are being copied by others. The aim of this is to make things more transparent and beneficial for the entire trading community. Realizing the need for traders to have a convenient and efficient copy trading scheme, NAGA Trader recently introduced an upgraded coping system.According to the updated NAGA Trader copy trading structure, a trader will now receive up to \u20ac0.60 for a single copier on a trade.While Euro, US Dollar, and Pound sterling bonuses can be earned for fiat trading accounts, users can also gain cryptocurrencies from stock trading by setting up an NGC trading account.To be eligible for this scheme, traders of the platform have to meet a number of straightforward conditions. The bonus is available only for real-money trades that are held open for at least 5 minutes before being closed.This bonus structure allows for potential extra profits on top of those gains made from trading stocks, cryptocurrencies, or forex. Copiers gain insight into successful trading, whereas those whose trades are getting copied earn more on top of the immediate profit from their trades.Sign up on NAGA Trader and get virtual $2,500 to try out copy trading.The Rundown Social Trading ImpactWhy care about copying trading strategies?Is it easy to earn bonuses when stock trading?"}

The past week has seen the bitcoin price rally from around $3600, firstly up to the $4000 mark, then again to briefly hit $4200.Join The Queue, BuddySince its unveiling on Valentine\u2019s Day, JPM Coin has received its fair share of (varyingly) constructive criticism.Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, said the project\u2026misses the point \u2013 introducing a closed network today is like launching AOL after Netscape\u2019s IPO.\u2026but then he would, as Ripple would appear to have most to lose if it is a success.Nick Szabo likened the token to Maduro\u2019s Petro in Venezuela, due to the levels of trust required to use it.There were those who insisted that by definition, the not open-and-permissionless JPM Coin shouldn\u2019t be called a cryptocurrency at all. Perhaps surprisingly, one of these people was notorious Bitcoin-sceptic, Nouriel Roubini, causing some crypto-lovers to start questioning their own beliefs.In which way has the new alleged JPMorgan crypto coin anything to do with blockchain/crypto? It is private not public, permissioned not permissionless, based on trusted authorities verifying transaction not trustless, centralized not decentralized. Calling it crypto is a joke\u2014 Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) February 14, 2019Where I Come From That\u2019s Fighting TalkJamie Dimon has had a fraught relationship with the cryptocurrency community, after calling Bitcoin a \u201cfraud\u201d back in 2017.

As we head into the weekly close we look at the price action and what may lie ahead.WEEKLY CHART Looking at the weekly chart at the time of writing, Bitcoin price 00 has cleared important technical levels of $4040 and $4106, which are the highest weekly closes since the fall from $6k.A close above $4100 would be significant as it would mean that BTC price has printed a higher weekly low and a higher weekly high, which would indicate a change in market structure and might imply a move higher would be in the works.The Mac-D has also crossed bullish and is printing higher highs on the histogram, showing that momentum favors the bulls.The 200-week moving average which has twice acted as support, continues to rise and will start next week at around $3400.DAILY CHART The 1-day chart shows that Bitcoin has moved up in three clear waves from the lows around $3400. The 50-day moving average lasted as resistance for almost a month before breaking, with the 100-day following closely.The CMF illustrates that there has been underlying buying pressure since Mid-December 2018, although there is some bearish divergence starting to show, which may imply Bitcoin may need to make a corrective move. Following three clear waves higher from the lows at $3400.There is usually an ABC corrective phase expected after such a move, which would test the bulls around $3900-$4000. if volume steps up in this range, it would be indicative of a move higher.Failing to find support around $4000 would see the 50 and 100-day cluster above $3500 as technical support, which must be held if Bitcoin price is will continue to climb higher in the coming weeks.MONTHLY CHART With February closing on Thursday evening, next week will be critical for Bitcoin price. A close above $4000 would mean bullishly engulfing the previous two monthly candles, which would bring the 6-month losing streak to an end. It would also be the first time there has been such an occurrence in the bear market.Volatility is likely to continue into early next week, with the outcome setting the tone for the month of March.Trade Bitcoin, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

Elsa Saikkonen | Feb 23, 2019 | 18:30 Share Tweet Send Share The cryptocurrency markets offered a pleasant little Saturday surprise today when the price of Bitcoin surged upwards of $4157 \u2014 injecting even more hopeium into a market fiending for the first higher high in approximately 14 months. Bitcoin (BTC) Daily ChartLooking at the bigger picture, we can see that Bitcoin (BTC) had officially run into what will most probably prove to be a zone of serious resistance. Buyers were able to push the price of the market leader past the first resistance level of approximately $4118.24, but price retraced back to just under that level at the time of this writing. Should BTC burst through this level \u2014 which is a very real possibility, a much more stern test will come at $4240.07. Finding support above this level would signal the first higher high since Bitcoin commended its brutal bear market after reaching roughly $20,000 in December 2017.What everyone is really watching right now, however, is that giant gap between $4410.63 and $5658.31. Should Bitcoin miraculously get to that area during this rally, there is little to stop the market leader from plowing full steam ahead for significant gains.Daily Stochastic RSIBefore we get too excited, however, optimism should be tempered with a look at the daily Stochastic RSI indicator.At the moment, the Stochastic RSI is hanging out in overbought territory. That said, there appears to be a bullish crossing on the horizon, thanks to Saturday\u2019s price pump. Nevertheless, investors looking to go long here should exercise extreme caution, as there may be significantly more risk than reward.Whichever way you spin it, Bitcoin is still in the throes of a bear market and hasn\u2019t put in a higher high in 14 months. The combination of this fact alongside an overbought daily Stochastic RSI and multiple levels of resistance upon us means that the more probable direction from here is down.

But for any Latin Americans and Venezuelans, in particular, Bitcoin isn\u2019t a speculative asset for getting rich quick\u2013it\u2019s a lifeline.Bitcoinist has reported several times over the course of the last year about the uptick in Venezuelans, Colombians, and other countries in Latin America buying bitcoin. In fact, the volume of Venezuelans buying bitcoin has steadily increased for more than 12 months (bar the week of Feb 16, which saw a somewhat unexplained drop).With such a marked rise often characterized by dramatic spikes from one week to the next, we even speculated over whether Venezuelans and Argentinians were buying the dip back in December 2018. But, we were wrong.It\u2019s so much more than that. The situation continues to worsen in this bruised and damaged country, and Maduro has now decided to sever all ties with the Colombian border over the weekend, cutting off the last lifeline to Venezuelans seeking refuge:I\u2019ve decided to sever all ties with the fascist government of Colombia.He stated, before dancing on national television as armed guards fired at people trying to move humanitarian aid into the country.Maduro dances on national TV as national guards fire tear gas and plastic pellets at crowds trying to move humanitarian aid into the country along the Colombian border pic.twitter.com/4u4zEHDixi\u2014 Patricia Laya (@PattyLaya) February 23, 2019So, despite the price hike yesterday followed by a swift correction, Venezuelans are buying bitcoins. And it isn\u2019t to see how high the price will go, or a way of making money. It\u2019s to actually purchase things. Not lambos, not million-dollar yachts\u2013just basic staples we take for granted, like milk and flour.Bitcoin Is More than a Speculative AssetThere may be an exceptionally large percentage of Bitcoin HODLers waiting for the price to go back up (look no further than John McAfee\u2019s extreme optimism). And he\u2019s certainly not the only one. Anyone with a decent stack of bitcoins or satoshis remains quietly confident despite the bear that the price will kick off in earnest again.These are not the people living in dictatorial countries exchanging small amounts of satoshis to buy food. According to Venezuelan economist, Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez, in an essay in the New York Times yesterday, Bitcoin has saved his family.He doesn\u2019t state his age in the article, but he does mention that he is now her family\u2019s breadwinner. This is thanks to his ability to transact small amounts of bitcoin and buy food for his family. His father works in a factory. But earning in a currency with a yearly inflation rate of 1.7 million percent, he takes home around $6 per month. He had tried to be a lawyer, but professionals facing this kind of indescribable hyperinflation, only get poorer. They have to look for any other option they can find to survive. His mother has no income, and Hern\u00e1ndez states:Cryptocurrencies helped my brother Juan, 28, escape Venezuela last summer.Hern\u00e1ndez himself was is able to buy milk by using the Localbitcoins site and finding a buyer for his bitcoins. He converts them into bol\u00edvars and then runs like mad to buy whatever he can get his hands on before they lose their value. He says:I keep all of my money in Bitcoin. Keeping it in bol\u00edvars would be financial suicide.Bitcoin Is Putting Food on the TableFor those trapped in Venezuela, life is daily struggle and supplies are getting scarce. The outside world is also getting further out of reach. Freelancers, for example, can no longer use a payment method such as PayPal since local controls only allow Venezuelan banks to use local currency.More and more Venezuelans are finding some source of sanctuary in using cryptocurrency. In this part of the world, it isn\u2019t an overstatement to say that Bitcoin is saving people\u2019s lives.And we can only hope that it continues. For while Hern\u00e1ndez is able to just about feed her family, for now, he can\u2019t exchange too much bitcoin at once. The government doesn\u2019t monitor cryptocurrency yet. But it does monitor transactions in bol\u00edvars:Any worth about $50 or more will automatically freeze your account until you can explain to your bank where the funds come from.So while the rest of us HODL and fret over getting \u2018rekt\u2019 on a trade or asking when moon, in Venezuela, we are poignantly reminded of bitcoin\u2019s real, true worth:\u201cBorderless money\u201d is more than a buzzword for those of us who live in a collapsing economy and a collapsing dictatorship.What other countries can Bitcoin help provide a lifeline?

This has provoked some savvy traders to take out a long position, but such a bold gamble is not without risk.Taking a long position in a bear market can certainly be profitable, but it is akin to swimming upstream. When the macro trend is down, buying or longing Bitcoin is to go against the overall trend of the market \u2014 which has been firmly down over the last 14 months.Indeed, a convincing and profitable bounce off of the 50-day EMA is possible, but only traders willing to stomach a large amount of risk should take such a bet and stop losses should be set.

Bitcoinist | Feb 25, 2019 | 15:00 Share Tweet Send Share With bated breath, each year investors from around the world await the annual letter from the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett. In my humble opinion, this year we received more insight into the current market conditions than any before. It seems that Buffett\u2019s company Berkshire Hathaway has joined in the global trend of buying back their own shares in 2018.Warren is known to be able to spot companies that are at fair value and it seems that the 88-year-old legendary investor is unable to find enough good deals out there that are worthy of his investment. So instead of buying new companies, he\u2019s opted to buy back shares in his own company.Thanks to an entire decade of low interest rates and ample liquidity injections from the world\u2019s central banks, companies are flush with cash and stocks are overvalued. (Rant continued, including implications for crypto, in section two)@MatiGreenspaneToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsNo More CountdownsAre we Entering a new cycle?What\u2019s with that crypto drop?Please note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of February 25th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsStocks are flying today on the news that President Trump has postponed the March 1st deadline for a US-China trade deal.As the tweet did not mention any new deadline, we can probably assume that there isn\u2019t one for the time being. The China 50 index has soared a jaw-dropping 6.31% this morning.Concurrently, it seems that the timetable for Brexit has once again been pushed forward. Prime Minister May has set her sights on March 12th for a final Brexit vote in Parliament. Of course, this deadline hardly seems set in stone and the real deadline for the UK to exit the EU is March 29th. Of course, this deadline hardly seems set in stone either and could very well be moved. Talk of extending it to mid-April is already floating around.For the first time in a long time, there are no countdown timers hanging over the market\u2019s head. We did prophesize that such a day might come in Friday\u2019s market update but I never thought it would come so soon.To be clear the geopolitical risks have not gone away, only that the specific time frame for any single risk materializing has become so obscure as to not be relevant. With the can successfully kicked down the road the central banks are once again in the driver\u2019s seat.New Cycle?As we know, markets tend to move in boom and bust cycles more commonly known as bull and bear markets. This is more often then not a simple function of the amount of available money in the world combined with the general sentiment towards investing.For different assets, we can expect different timeframes for these cycles. For example in the stock market, the average cycle is usually about 4.5 years. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is new and because it\u2019s price discovery is going through a period of discovery, cycles may vary from a few months to more than a year. For now, we\u2019re at the tail end of bitcoin\u2019s longest ever bear run.The volatility of 2017 and 2018 was driven by expectations around the world\u2019s central banks. We saw massive price rises across all industries in \u201917 as the Fed continued to feed the markets and in \u201918 investments started to dry up as the Fed signaled a shift in policy.At the beginning of 2019, the world\u2019s central banks have pledged further support and we can see the impact on the stocks very clearly. Arguably, this new sentiment could be having a knock on effect in the crypto market.Yes, I\u2019m rambling, I know, but here\u2019s a graph that should put everything I\u2019m saying into context.With bitcon in blue and the Dow Jones in red, we use a double X-axis to determine if the direction of travel is proportionate. For further accentuation of the magnitude of these moves, I\u2019ve set both lines to a logarithmic scale.Where are we now?Notice how the stock market has responded very quickly to the Fed\u2019s shift in policy and has already recouped almost all of its Q4 losses. Bitcoin has not done so just yet.Yesterday\u2019s Crypto PlungeIn truth, I have no idea what caused yesterday\u2019s crypto plunge. Most likely, some crypto traders were piling on just a little too much leverage and the market pushed back by taking them out. Or, it could have been a large seller. Or, it could have been any combination of several factors playing out.However, there are a few things we can learn from this type of movement so here are a few thoughts that I had about it\u2026.Number one, even though the market continues to mature, these bouts of volatility, both up and down, remind us that the market is extremely volatile and therefore risky. So, it always pays to diversify your portfolio with other assets.Number two, like the surge we saw last Sunday, yesterday\u2019s plunge was led by altcoins Ethereum and EOS. So, even though there seems to be a growing divide between excitement over bitcoin and sentiment in the rest of the markets, we can see that they are influencing each other as the markets remain correlated.Number three, the level of the pullback is actually quite encouraging. In fact, most of Sunday\u2019s 9% plunge was actually just erasing some of Saturday\u2019s gains. Ever since the spike on February 8th, the market has been trying to build support at $3,500. Yesterday we stalled a good $300 above that.If January was a giant downward facing staircase, February has now turned into an upward one.Wishing you a fantastic week ahead!Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalysteToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

A week after the attack, the issue reportedly persists, highlighting the need for decentralized and stable alternatives. Bank of Valletta Through \u20ac13M Cyber AttackOn February 13th, Times of Malta reported that the Bank of Valletta, the oldest established financial services provider and the country and one of its largest, shut down all operations following a cybersecurity breach.Hackers managed to break into the bank\u2019s system and moved as much as 13 million euros into foreign accounts.All of the bank\u2019s functions, including ATMs, branches, mobile banking and even its email services were suspended, while its website went offline.Following the attack, the country\u2019s Prime Minister said that the fraudulent transactions had been traced and are being reversed. Meanwhile, the bank reassured its customers that their accounts are not compromised.Issues Not Yet ResolvedDespite the strong affirmations on behalf of the bank and the Prime Minister, 10 days after the attack, customers continue complaining that payments to third parties are still not processed.One person said that the bank failed to provide any accurate information on when the issues will be taken care of:There is no information whatsoever on when this will be resolved. They told us specifically that they have no idea if it is days or weeks.It also appears that the problem has also affected account holders in the UK. Not only is the bank reported to refuse to provide any timelines, but it also wouldn\u2019t issue any proof of explanation, according to another customer, who is already late with his rent payment because he can\u2019t access his account.Moreover, apart from individual customers, businesses have also come in touch with the Times of Malta, voicing their concerns that the issue would have a negative impact on their operations.Meanwhile, the bank has issued a formal statement, saying that it \u201cwill endeavor to have them (third-party payment services) fully operational by Monday.\u201dHave We Not Learned Yet?Bank of Valletta is far from being the first major financial institution to experience issues which refrain its customers from accessing their own funds.Earlier this month, Wells Fargo, one of the largest banking and financial services provider in the world with almost $1.9 trillion in assets, experienced a system failure because \u201csmoke was detected\u201d at one of the bank\u2019s facilities.Last year, Bitcoinist reported that Visa\u2019s network crashed, causing users to experience serious issues with their card payments. Again, the official explanation was that the network outage was caused by some sort of \u201csystem failure.\u201dDecentralization could well solve all of the above issues.

Do the BartIn all the woe and misery of the crypto-winter, we can often find some meagre warmth from a positive story. An uplifting tale of a plucky hero, bucking the trend, and beating the system. Well this is not that story. While the rest of us felt the pain of Sunday\u2019s \u2018Bart\u2019 on the chart, Bitcoin whales were busy accumulating coins. So that\u2019s nice\u2026 for them.Last week saw some interesting movement in bitcoin, with the price 00 jumping first to $4000, then again on Saturday to briefly hit $4200. Unfortunately, Sunday saw a reversal, with price dropping back to $3800. Still a good $200 more than it had been trading at, but not the breakout hoped for.Of course, it wasn\u2019t all bad news, as those who sold at the peak, or with cash to spare, could buy back in at the lower price. Which is exactly what the Bitcoin whales (holders of large amounts of bitcoin) did. In fact, that\u2019s pretty much what the whales have been doing for this entire bear market.In the past two months alone, holders of the 100 \u2018fattest\u2019 bitcoin wallet addresses have managed to accumulate over 150,000 additional coins, or well over half a billion US dollars.52 Card PickupThe five largest wallets belong to exchanges (Bittrex, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Huobi, and Binance) which all hold over 100,000 bitcoin. In the two months from December 17, 2018 to February 25, 2019, these added 2879 BTC, making a total holding of 573,958 BTC.According to data from BitInfoCharts, the next 100 largest wallets (holding 10,000-100,000 BTC) accumulated over 150,000 BTC in the same period. In fact, at time of writing, these wallets held nearly 2.29 million BTC. Although another 2 wallets had risen into this bracket by this point, making 102 whales.Call Me IshmaelSo where have all these additional bitcoin come from? Well, according to the data the only bracket whose wallets have less BTC is from 1,000 \u2013 10,000. One would imagine that the bulk of this move comes from wallets accumulating bitcoin and moving up into the next bracket.Unless the whales had recently sold at the peak, they would have been financially better off buying at $3600 a week earlier than at $3800 after the drop. Nevertheless, whenever there are unexplained price movements, it is perhaps somewhat comforting that we can always blame the whales.

Huobi cut around 100 staff from its global workforce of 1400, saying that:We do not know how long the bear market will last, so [\u2026] We have to plan in advance and spend money carefully.It seemed that the company was planning particularly well in advance, as CEO, Livio Weng Xiaoqi, admitted at the time that revenues were still in the positive every single month.However, Huobi did spend a lot of money on industry development and promotion last year. Cutting unprofitable departments such as venture funding and news aggregation was perhaps inevitable. The Australian office appear to have found themselves on the wrong side of this belt tightening.No AUSTRAC RequiredThe move also means that Huobi Australia have \u2018decided not to explore adding a fiat on-ramp,\u2019 instead sticking with crypto-to-crypto. This means they do not require an AUSTRAC registration. The Australian Transaction Reports And Analysis Centre is a government financial intelligence agency. Its role is to identify money laundering, organised crime, tax evasion, welfare fraud and terrorism.It is possible that the decision to close the Australian office relates to this registration.Whilst there is no suggestion that Huobi is involved in any of the mentioned activities, reports from the Blockchain Transparency Institute allege widespread wash-trading.

Here we can see XRP\u2019s reaction to the news, a mere 10% pump that almost brought us to the previous day\u2019s high.No matter though\u2026Nasdaq is Bullish on CryptoWas pretty shocked to see this article syndicated on Nasdaq.com\u2026Though it\u2019s not explicitly stated in the article, it does seem that the author\u2019s opinion was a resounding \u2018yes\u2019. Even though it was written last Friday by a finance website called Safehaven, it reads almost like something that I might have written and the fact that it was reposted to the website of the world\u2019s second largest stock exchange shows a lot about how Wall Street is feeling about crypto at the moment.After all, why not? The new bitcoin futures products are set to be offered on the Nasdaq, as well as ICE, very soon.One other thing that hadn\u2019t occurred to me until now was a quote in the article from Su Zhu, who pointed to the stockpiles of cash currently being held in stable coins. Su referenced the current market cap of Tether, which is standing at $2 billion today. But if we add the other top stablecoins to the equation, that\u2019s more than $2.75 billion that could very easily be repurposed into bitcoin and the alts.Meanwhile, volumes across crypto exchanges are currently holding at their highest levels since the 2017 peak and the quotes are flashing green today.As always, please continue sending me your thoughts, questions, and feedbacks.

But will this force Apple and other smartphone makers to also enter the crypto-arms race? Samsung Galaxy S10 to Support DAppsLast week Bitcoinist reported that the new flagship smartphone of Samsung, the Galaxy S10, will include a dedicated secure storage solution for storing private keys.News coming from the Samsung Mobile Business Summit in Barcelona confirmed that the storage solution will support Bitcoin, Ethereum, as well as altcoins called Cosmo Coin (COSM) and Enjin (ENJ).In a bizarre turn of events, Samsung today announced its wallet app at MWC. Supported assets: BTC, ETH, ENJ (some tiny in-game currency thing) and COSM (absolute shitcoin from Korea for buying beauty products \u2013 WTF?!)Hardly any details. I'd wager this doesn't ship on US models. pic.twitter.com/wXa0mJCYD2\u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) February 25, 2019In addition, however, the smartphone will also support select decentralized applications (DApps). As of yet, the only DApp available for Samsung Galaxy S10 is called Cosmee. Its decentralized nature, however, is questionable, to say the least.Cosmee is a Korean project developed by Cosmochain and it rewards users with COSM for leaving beauty reviews through the DApp.Going through their whitepaper, however, raises more than just an eyebrow. According to the document, customer-provided data will be stored on \u201cthe blockchain.\u201dSomewhat expected, the whitepaper doesn\u2019t mention if the project will be developing its own blockchain or whether it will use an already existing one. It only says that the team \u201cis spending a considerable amount of time and efforts on research.\u201d There is also no mention of nodes or consensus algorithms.In any case, this first project featured on Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 does look like an attempt to capitalize on trending buzzwords rather than truly offer support for decentralized apps \u2013 which may not even really *need* to be decentralized in the first place.Prices Surge on The NewsThe announcement of Samsung Galaxy S10\u2019s support for COSM and ENJ has caused the prices of both altcoins to surge notably.Enjin Coin 00 has managed to gain upwards of 104 percent in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCapCOSM, on the other hand, is also marking serious gains. At the time of this writing, the cryptocurrency has increased with around 50 percent on the day.Samsung Bets on E-GamingSamsung\u2019s move to partner up with Enjin is likely in an effort to further the company\u2019s involvement into the fast-growing e-sports market, especially in Asia.Enjin is a Singaporean-based company, which launched Enjin Coin, and is creating an ecosystem for gaming. The platform reportedly has 20 million users and over 250,000 gaming communities onboarded. The Enjin Coin is used to purchase in-game assets and assign ownership of them.Samsung has also partnered with game engine maker Unity Technologies in order to enable games to run smoother on the Galaxy S10.In any case, Samsung is certainly embracing everything cryptocurrency and blockchain in an attempt to sell its latest flagship smartphone. It remains to be seen if this strategy pays off, but its biggest competitors, namely Apple and Huawei, are certainly watching.What do you think of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 and its support for DApps?

Bitcoin Will Trade Between $3,000 and $5,000Speaking to Huoxing24, Sun declared that the cryptocurrency bear market was over. According to the TRON chief, Bitcoin won\u2019t see another massive price breakout within the next three to five years. Instead, Sun expects the top-ranked cryptocurrency to fluctuate between $3,000 and $5,000.For Sun, 2019 is going to be a watershed year for cryptocurrencies, heralding several market breakthroughs. He pointed to the expansion of the lightning network and improvements in the DApp ecosystem as likely contributors to an increased level of crypto adoption.Sun\u2019s comment came as part of an interview during the \u2018Voice Your Love\u2018 charity event organized by the ALS Association in conjunction with TRON and Binance\u2019s Blockchain Charity Foundation (BCF).Changpeng Zhao (\u2018CZ\u2019), the Binance CEO, elected not to offer a forecast for Bitcoin. Instead, CZ declared that cryptocurrencies were here to stay and that blockchain technology would eventually affect society on a global scale.Blockchain to Boost Transparency of Charity OrganizationsConcerning blockchain, CZ also itemized a few benefits of decentralized technology adoption for charity organizations. Apart from improved security, the technology could allow for accurate tracking of donations to reduce donor concerns regarding the misappropriation of such contributions.CZ opines that blockchain can help improve the transparency of such organizations while Sun says such a move would mean another example of the technology\u2019s ability to positively affect the larger society.Earlier in February 2019, TRON announced that it would be joining the ALS Association in its advocacy for patients with the disease, donating $250,000 in the process.Sun believes it is crucial that other crypto and blockchain companies participate in charitable activities around the world. Speaking during the interview, the TRON CEO said that such moves would help to showcase the usefulness of the technology outside finance and into the broader social scene.TRON\u2019s contribution to the ALS Association isn\u2019t its first charitable donation. Back in October 2018, Sun donated about $3 million to BCF. As reported by Bitcoinist, Binance says it donates its listing fees to charity.Blockchain Education Needed for Mainstream AdoptionWhile identifying industry as being ripe for decentralized technology disruption, CZ maintains that a fair bit of effort is required to educate people about how the technology works. Commenting on the matter, Zhao, said:On this road of exploration, we also encountered various challenges: for example, how to let uneducated villagers understand the concept of blockchain; how to make blocks in areas where there is no computer, mobile phone, or even network, and power.Zhao, however, notes that the task isn\u2019t as arduous as it may seem on face value. According to CZ, school teachers in remote rural areas in Africa have been able to correctly understand the technology in less than half an hour despite having no prior experience with the concept.Do you think blockchain technology can find useful applications in the activities of charities?

Hackers will always be trying to exploit vulnerabilities or find back-doors. But Coinomi wallet apparently made things a bit too easy, by sending a plain-text seed to Google API for spellchecking.How Do You Spell \u2018Cleaned Out\u2019?The bug came to light after a user noticed $60k-70k of cryptocurrency had disappeared after installing the wallet. The user had entered the passphrase for another wallet into the restore field, to move some unsupported assets. A week later 90% of his main wallet funds were missing, comprising purely the Coinami-supported assets.Some further investigation, using software to monitor http traffic from running applications, revealed the bombshell. When entering a passphrase in the \u2018Restore Wallet\u2019 field, it is sent as plain-text to googleapis.com for spell-checking. You can witness this in the video below:https://avoid-coinomi.com/files/coinomi_http_traffic_video.mp4How Do You Spell \u2018WTF\u2019?In fact, entering any random sentence with a spelling mistake will result in a red-underline once the spellchecker has done its business. But why on earth would a wallet ever need to send the seed (or any other text) to a spellchecker? Spoiler\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t.Apparently the software used to build Coinami wallet has spellchecking enabled as default on any text-field. However, it is easy to disable this, and inexcusable that Coinami did not do this with such sensitive data.Also worth noting is that the plain-text seed is sent over a secure socket layer.

For their part, Coinami have identified the addresses where the funds remain untouched since the \u2018incident\u2019. These addresses have been blacklisted, so no exchange will deal with them, but the user is demanding a more immediate resolution.This isn\u2019t the first time that Coinami has faced major privacy issues. Last year, there was an issue whereby the wallet was leaking user addresses in plain-text on opening.I warned people to stay away from @CoinomiWallet last year after I discovered a major privacy issue where they were leaking all users address in plain text as soon as you open the app.https://t.co/a8UNKVICO7https://t.co/pIUY1eFxmjhttps://t.co/92HwU3Etfghttps://t.co/6oLwRSgvSC\u2014 Luke Childs (@lukechilds) February 27, 2019Have you used Coinomi?

Unlike Reddit, it has a decentralized structure.Participants paste any given URL into a separate field, principally a browser extension, type their comment and click on a \u2018Dissent this\u2019 button which syncs their text with the page\u2019s URL. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing\u2026 developers can do,\u201d Gab CEO Andrew Torba explained in a video introduction to the platform earlier this week. The browser extension also contains voting facilities for both comments and URLs in a manner similar to Reddit up and downvoting. The initiative appears to have immediately struck a chord with the internet community. Google Trends data suggests this was instantaneous following the release of the introduction, while Gab itself recorded a total of nearly 7,000 users for launch day.That number puts Dissent close to the current daily active DApp user tally for Ethereum, according to dappradar.com.Perhaps unsurprisingly, users immediately took advantage of the platform\u2019s features to lambaste one URL within the cryptocurrency industry which has proven particularly controversial.\u201cBitcoin.com is operated by people trying to deceive the public into believing that their cheap knockoff copy of Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin,\u201d one reads, echoing sentiment expressed by others.Was waiting for this one lol #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/KVOYZaw6PV\u2014 \ud83c\udd95By Gab: Dissenter.com (@getongab) February 27, 2019Bitcoin Micropayments Next?Coming at a time when cryptocurrency tipping has hit Twitter, Dissent would further appear an ideal candidate from micropayments via the rapidly-expanding Bitcoin Lightning Network.As Bitcoinist reported, Gab has already begun major advocacy of Bitcoin, officials in December stating they felt a \u201cnecessity\u201d to promote it as \u201cfree speech money.\u201dThat admission came months after US exchange Coinbase had shut down Gab\u2019s account in a move which generated cries of censorship. Correspondingly, should crypto payments hit Dissent, these would likely avoid any centralized third party, and instead favor the decentralized Lightning Network.Earlier this month, Tippin.me, the extension for Lightning tips, became available for Twitter users, around the same time the social network\u2019s CEO Jack Dorsey said it was a matter of \u201cwhen,\u201d not \u201cif\u201d regarding Bitcoin integration in his payment company Square.What do you think about Gab Dissenter?

Most people outside of the U.S. have never heard of Wyoming. Yet, the home of the famed Yellowstone National Park, steep canyons, and gushing geysers is firmly on the cryptocurrency community\u2019s radar.It started about a year ago, with blockchain friendly bills. But things really kicked off in earnest ever since governer Mark Gordon praised the local blockchain industry during his inauguration speech. Wyoming resoundingly voted to pass a blockchain bank bill despite mounting criticism. Then Cardano moved to the Forever West state. And just a couple of weeks back, Wyoming became the first state to give bitcoin owners full property rights. As if that wasn\u2019t enough progress for you in an otherwise draconian country when it comes to cryptocurrency, yesterday the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition announced that they just signed four new blockchain bills in Wyoming.4 more bills signed by Governor Gordon.

They pertain to Special Purpose Depository Institutions, Commercial Filing System, Corporate Stock Tokens, and Digital Assets \u2013 Existing Law.Special Purpose Depository Institutions: This is to create institutions to service blockchain companies that cannot access traditional banking services. However, these institutions are prohibited from providing loans and must maintain 100 percent of its deposits in its reserves. They must also comply with applicable federal laws.Commercial Filing System: This blockchain bill authorizes the Secretary of State to create a blockchain-based commercial filing system for business entity registration submissions and reports, certain financial statements, and other similar types of filings.Corporate Stock Certificate Tokens: This bill allows businesses in Wyoming to issue \u2018certificate tokens\u2019 on a blockchain rather than stock certificates. This way, they can choose whether to list certificated or uncertificated blockchain shares.Digital Assets \u2013 Existing Law: This classifies digital assets by type (virtual currencies or digital securities) and specifies how each one should be treated in the context of existing commercial laws. Wyoming banks can also opt to become custodians of digital assets under the terms of this bill.These incredibly bold moves from the state lead to its supporters coming out with responses like:Long Wyoming, short New YorkNot Every State Is So ProgressiveIn stark contrast, New York is one of the three worst states in the U.S. for blockchain companies. Its controversial BitLicence forces exchanges to disclose all information on their global client base. This been labeled by many as \u2018regulatory overreach\u2019. And it may even be in violation of international privacy laws.New York also recently announced the creation of a cryptocurrency task force, which may also see regulators clamping down further.Rhode Island and Arizona have also joined the list of states that blockchain companies should avoid. Both states decided to tax cryptocurrency providers and services that accept them, with many critics accusing them of applying an \u2018innovation tax\u2019.For now, blockchain companies in the U.S. reluctant to leap over the pond would do well to head out west to Wyoming.Will Wyoming become the hotspot for Bitcoin businesses?

Now we can add conspiracy-theory propagation mouthpiece, Alex Jones, to Bitcoin\u2019s illustrious list of champions. Outspoken conspiracy-theorist and dietary-supplement peddler Alex Jones recently appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, where he called cryptocurrencies \u2018the future.\u2019In typical anti-establishment fashion, Jones sowed mistrust about the government-controlled fiat-based economy, saying:We have a private federal reserve that\u2019s all fiat \u2013 I\u2019m not judging anybody, I\u2019m just saying: be careful.Jones\u2019 support for cryptocurrency is perhaps unsurprising, as last year he was de-platformed by the majority of social media and PayPal. This came as part of the wave of PayPal banning of purportedly right-wing outlets such as Gab and The Hacker News towards the end of 2018.As a poster boy for Bitcoin, there\u2019s a risk that his supporting message will drown in the background noise.For example, he also told Rogan that eight years ago George Soros had offered him $5 million to pump Bitcoin. This, he claimed, was worth $38 million at the peak of 2017\u2019s bull-run, but he refused it. This may just be a miscalculation of value or timing; the approximately 2,000 bitcoin which were worth $38 million at peak was actually worth $5 million just 21 months ago.But true or not, this quite incredible claim pales into insignificance compared to some of the outlandish things Jones has said.What if Stephen Hawking was Satoshi Nakamoto?Bitcoin needs a champion with both credibility and popularity to truly become mainstream. If we found out that Stephen Hawking was Satoshi Nakamoto, it would do the trick. Hawking\u2019s reputation as a clever person would convince many a person thus far untroubled by thoughts of Bitcoin that it was a good idea.Heck, for the UK at least, even cut-price Hawking \u2014 TV physicist, and ex-pop star, Brian Cox \u2014 saying that Bitcoin is \u2018kinda good\u2019 would probably do the trick.We had high hopes for Musk, but he seems intent on blowing both his credibility and his popularity of late.There are plenty of credible sports and entertainment stars who have expressed their love of cryptocurrency. All we need is one or two of them to promote a sustained pump to get the world listening again.Now, where\u2019s George Soros with 5 million bucks when you need him?

Coinbase Breaching Its Own RulesXRP trading went live on Coinbase Pro on February 25th. Formerly known as GDAX, the platform provides traders with more advanced features compared to the regular one known as just Coinbase.Naturally, the price of XRP 00 surged following the announcement, gaining over 10 percent on the news.A new report by Diar, however, points out that Coinbase Pro has breached its very own listing policies in order to include XRP in its trading portfolio.According to GDAX\u2019s Digital Asset Framework, one of the considerations Coinbase evaluates prior to listing a new cryptocurrency is team ownership. More specifically, the document reads:The ownership stake retained by the team is a minority stake.Diar, on the other hand, argues that Ripple \u201cholds nearly 60% of the supply in escrow with a release schedule.\u201dIt\u2019s also worth noting in January, cryptocurrency data company Messari issued a report suggesting that Ripple may be overstating the digital token\u2019s real market cap by as much as 47 percent.Was the Listing Paid For?Meanwhile, investor and entrepreneur as well as popular Bitcoin proponent, Alistair Milne, revealed a conversation between him and Elliot Suthers, Director of Communications at Coinbase.Milne asked the high ranked official about the amount of XRP Ripple paid to Coinbase in return for the listing, what are the selling restrictions on that amount, and whether Coinbase has consulted with the SEC/CFTC whether it\u2019s \u201cOK to sell a security.\u201dWhat followed was an ambiguous lack of confirmation or denial:\u201cHappy to discuss this off the record, but we\u2019re not discussing publicly,\u201d said Suthers.Did Ripple pay Coinbase for their token being listed?\"we're not discussing publicly\"#xrp #youregoddamnrighttheydid pic.twitter.com/cuuxWGt6ch\u2014 Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) February 26, 2019Do you think Ripple has paid Coinbase for its XRP listing?

Called ION, the new project is an interactive guide for learning how the Lightning Network works and for experimenting with the popular second-layer solution to Bitcoin\u2019s scalability issues. Until now, Radar has been most widely known for Radar Relay, a decentralized application (dApp) on Ethereum.Radar\u2019s new Lightning Network onramp may be the easiest way for individuals to get connected to Bitcoin\u2019s second-layer solution. According to a press release, ION\u2019s homepage \u201cincludes everything a new user needs to join the Lightning Network on a single page, including a testnet mode sandbox for new users to experiment with Lightning payments risk-free and a mainnet mode with comprehensive resources to behind using real Bitcoin for real products and services.\u201dAdditionally, Radar offers ION News to keep users up to date on the latest Lightning Network developments and ION Wiki, a collection of informative resources, tools, and applications for Lightning Network.Blockchain Capital partner Spencer Bogart noted:Bitcoin is the most exciting and empowering thing to happen to financial markets in decades and the Lightning Network is taking things to the next level. The biggest challenge, however, is onboarding users and I\u2019m thrilled to see Radar tackling this challenge head-on with ION.Likewise, Radar ION Product Lead Brandon Curtis stated:The Lightning Network is rapidly improving, but accessibility for new users and feature discovery and integration for developers are challenging problems that haven\u2019t received much attention. By helping more people to connect and providing them with the tools to build and experiment, we can accelerate adoption and exploration of what the Lightning Network is capable of.There is certainly a lot to be excited about when it comes to Bitcoin (BTC) and the Lightning Network.

Now that the market is showing signs that Spring is coming, those plans are back on the table. After all, they wouldn\u2019t want to miss out on the next bull run.It looks likely that, within the next few months, every portfolio manager in the world will have easy access to trade on and invest in bitcoin, ethereum, and other cryptoassets.@MatiGreenspaneToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsInjured HawkEndless Supply of MoneyThe Crypto ZombiePlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of February 27th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsAs the Fed Chair Jerome Powell was giving his testimony to Congress yesterday some pictures emerged on Twitter of an injured hawk that had been valiantly rescued by the New York Police Department.Several market pundits were quick to capitalize on the obvious play on words as a \u2018hawk\u2019 in financial terminology is someone who advocates higher interest rates and tighter monetary policy.In many ways, Chairman Powell is like an injured hawk. He came into his role while the economy was flying, but shortly he stressed the need to raise interest rates, the stock markets went into a tizzy and the Fed was forced to back down. Even in his testimony yesterday while Powell did emphasize that the economy was strong, he still reiterated the need for patience when raising interest rates.Endless Supply of MoneyAnother issue that Chairman Powell touched on yesterday, which I feel is worth bringing to your attention, is the idea that because the United States is able to print as many US Dollars as they want, they can potentially rack up an unlimited amount of debt with little effect on the economy.The injured hawk pushed back strongly against this concept yesterday and even highlighted one of the growing problems in the US economy that we\u2019ve been speaking about in these daily updates for a while now.Of course, this isn\u2019t an immediate concern of the financial markets but it\u2019s worth thinking about as investors increasingly rely on central banks to prop up financial markets.Crypto Condition NormalAfter the weekend\u2019s excitement, the crypto markets have been particularly flat over the last 48 hours. Volumes across exchanges have come down from the highs but remain elevated.In many ways, this is a positive progression. We\u2019ve discussed several times already how volatility is the double-edged sword of the crypto markets. Ideally, the best way forward is to see more gradual gains rather than these wild boom and bust cycles.This was also a defining topic of a recent conversation I had with a popular YouTuber nicknamed K-Dub on his channel Crypto Zombie. The feedbacks on our broadcast were fantastic so definitely wanted to share this with you as well.Make sure to catch the recording at this link, and definitely check out his channel as well.

It\u2019s laughable Jamie Dimon has been very vocal criticizing Bitcoin as a way to try and stop it and that didn\u2019t work. Honey Badger don\u2019t care. Now he\u2019s trying to compete with his insecure, centralized, hot steaming pile of dog crap called JPM Coin. LOL.Warren Buffet recently called Bitcoin a \u201cdelusion\u201d that attracts charlatans. Why are top execs like Dimon and Buffet so vehemently opposed to Bitcoin (but not \u2018blockchain)? Buffett\u2019s returns are tied directly to the Ponzi-economics of fractional reserve, illicit money printing by banks and central banks, market rigging and accounting fraud \u2013 all made easy \u2013 thanks to the absence of Hard Money in our economy.Of course, Buffett hates Bitcoin and Gold for the same reason thieves hate locks and bacteria hate antibiotics. Buffett is a scammer who prints money via the banks he\u2019s involved with to buy monopoly positions in large American companies that he then rips apart with mass-layoffs and stock buybacks. He\u2019s the Charles Manson of Wall Street. In our past interview, you said that the 2018 Bitcoin bear market was the result of the USD strengthening amid expected rate hikes. How will bitcoin react to the Fed now going into \u2018permanent QE\u2019 in 2019? The trend in Bitcoin\u2019s price flipped from bear to bull once the Fed said it would ease-off tightening and engage in permanent money printing (\u2018permanent QE\u2019). This, by the way, is the definition of debt-monetization, which means the door has been opened to a hyperinflationary currency collapse of the USD. Since you always say \u201cyou can\u2019t taper a Ponzi\u201d are negative interest rates inevitable? What does this mean for cash and how will it affect bitcoin? Nine trillion in global sovereign debt has been issued with a negative interest rate (buyers lock in a loss if held to maturity). Negative rates are coming to retail bank accounts. This is wealth confiscation by the bank cartels to keep their insolvent balance sheets from imploding. The impact on Bitcoin and Gold will be moving to new ATH as safe-haven money pours in.Bitcoin isn\u2019t like a commodity since it\u2019s production (of blocks) is constant regardless of demand. It\u2019s not really like a stock either since its supply is hard-capped. Even Satoshi called it \u201cbloody hard\u201d to write a description for it since there\u2019s \u201cnothing to relate it to.\u201d How would you classify Bitcoin? Is an entirely new definition needed?Correct. Bitcoin is an entirely new asset class that so far has eluded definition by anyone. I could expand on this more, but for the purpose of this interview, suffice to say, that some surprises are still to come in terms of how Bitcoin interacts with the global economy and how every definition of money, economics and finance will have to be rewritten.You also believe that hard money like Bitcoin discourages starting wars. Can you talk a little bit more on this considering the latest tensions in Venezuela and Kashmir?Fairtrade using Hard Money is peaceful. Unfair trade using unsound money, like fiat money, causes tension, resentments, violence, and wars.Venezuela is a money printing basket case that is printing its way into the loss of sovereignty. If they switched to Bitcoin and/or Gold they could keep their sovereignty. The same can be said for India and Pakistan. The only country in the world that seems to understand this is Russia. They are aggressively stockpiling Gold and I\u2019m hearing from Kremlin sources they will be adding Bitcoin later this year.What are your thoughts on the \u2018bitcoin mining is wasteful and bad for the planet\u2019 argument?It\u2019s a dumb, non-starter argument. If anything, bitcoin mining is an incredible reduction in energy usage:It promotes renewables for efficiency, bitcoin miners are portable, they go wherever there\u2019s excess energy that is going to waste.As the USD (and other paper money) collapses \u2013 energy usage by these fiat schemes, bigger than Bitcoin by a huge factor \u2013 will also collapse, resulting in a net reduction in energy use by 90% globally. I predict that eventually, Bitcoin\u2019s carbon footprint will be zero and fiat money will disappear.Wyoming is quickly becoming a \u2018blockchain-friendly\u2019 US state that has been in the headlines lately for its pro-cryptocurrency business legislation. Where do you stand on regulating Bitcoin?Wyoming sees an opportunity to steal some thunder from Delaware and Nevada and become the go-to state for Bitcoin incorporation. This is fantastic news for Bitcoin and Bitcoin businesses. Caitlin Long and Trace Mayer are doing an amazing job. Before we go\u2026 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Trump? Who would pump Bitcoin price the most? Some Bitcoin heavyweights have the ear of Trump, so I\u2019ll go with fellow New Yorker Trump on this one. What do you think of Max Keiser\u2019s comments?

Experts say the comparatively less intrusive and stealthy nature of malicious crypto-mining is the primary reason why it is fast becoming the attack vector of choice for cybercriminals.Cybercriminals Pivot to CryptojackingIn a report published by the IBM X-Force Research team on Wednesday (February 27, 2019), the company reported that 2018 saw a massive increase in cyber attacks against organizations across the world.According to the report, cryptojacking dominated the field as cybercriminals appear to be pivoting away from ransomware and malware attacks.The report indicated that stealthy cryptocurrency mining attacks increased by 450 percent between Q1 and Q4 2018. Meanwhile, ransomware attacks dropped by 45 percent during the same period. IBM says the extent of the spread of cryptojacking attacks covers both desktop and mobile platforms.In 2018, Bitcoinist covered multiple instances of such attacks from Tesla cloud-computing platform to The Pirate Bay (TBP) torrent downloading service.Cryptojacking is Less DisruptiveExperts say cybercriminals are pivoting towards malicious crypto-mining due to its less disruptive nature. Speaking to Fortune, Charles Henderson of the IBM X-Force Red, said:With the extortion racket of ransomware, you lose the customer after one transaction, so it\u2019s a one and done, there\u2019s no recurring revenue-I mean it\u2019s just bad business.According to Henderson, cryptojacking is akin to a revenue subscription model where the hacking cartels can count on a continuous revenue stream as long as the victims remain unaware. Whereas, for ransomware attacks, the attacker only gets one bulk payment per victim.More Sinister Repercussions Up AheadWhile malicious crypto-mining might appear less menacing on the surface than ransomware and malware attacks, Henderson says ignoring its spread could have severe repercussions in the future. He adds that it is not beyond the realms of possibility for criminals to use cryptojacking for more malicious attack vectors.What\u2019s more, experts like Henderson say cybercriminals are perfecting their craft. Thus, if left unchecked, cryptojacking can move from surreptitious virtual currency mining to botnets used for spyware attacks.

So Anthony Pompliano tweeted an offer to hook them up with Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network nationwide.Fees-a Not Accepted HereIt all started on Friday when Kroger announced the move to no longer accept Visa credit cards, citing excessive fees. The Smith\u2019s chain comprises 134 food and drug stores across 7 states, employing 20,000 staff.Card fees charged by Visa are higher at Smith\u2019s than any other credit card brand, explained Kroger CFO, Mike Schlotman:Visa has been misusing its position and charging retailers excessive fees for a long time.Visa is actually due to increase fees for the banks processing card payments on behalf of merchants in April.Pomp And CircumstanceIn the circumstances, it seemed only natural for somebody to suggest a crypto alternative, and Pompliano rose to the occasion. \u201cWho knows someone on the leadership team there?\u201d he tweeted.The Morgan Creek Digital team will fly to meet them and get them hooked up with the Lightning Network nationwide.A couple of hours later a product manager from Kroger Digital tweeted a response and set up a conversation.Obviously, the Ripple army dove right onto this, questioning Lightning Network\u2019s readiness, and suggesting XRP as a better alternative. More interestingly, someone suggested selling Smith\u2019s gift-cards on BitRefill, which would certainly make a zero effort stop-gap solution.The Tip Of The IcebergBut this is a very big deal. Smith\u2019s is the second Kroger brand to stop accepting Visa credit cards, after Foods Co. supermarkets in California. Successful implementation of a Lightning Network payment solution at the retailer could lead to a wider roll-out across Kroger brands.Kroger is the largest supermarket chain by revenue and the third largest employer in the United States, along with the third largest retailer in the world. As of December 2018, it operated 2,765 supermarkets and multi-department stores, either directly or through subsidiaries.Ripple army excepted, I\u2019m sure there is a high level of confidence in Pompliano and Morgan Creek Digital to make this work.And Visa\u2026 you only have yourself to blame!Will major retailers like Kroger accept Bitcoin and Lightning Network payments?

Ziya has since transferred it to another Iranian.\u201c[L]et\u2019s keep the Censorship Resistance trend going,\u201d he wrote, suggesting that developers of web browser Tor should be next in line to get involved.Beyond the Torch, the Lightning Network continues to expand a-pace within Bitcoin. Statistics from monitoring resource 1ML.com confirm that overall capacity increased almost 20 percent in february, while the number of nodes and channels went up 19 and 39 percent respectively.Lightning also goes far beyond payments.

In fact, beyond a blog post announcing the acquisition of Neutrino (brandished by Reporters Without Borders as an \u201cEnemy of the Internet\u201d) and then a later slip about leaking client data, the silence has been deafening.The Coinbase Neutrino ScandalAmong the rising anger across social media and the hashtag that has appeared #DeleteCoinbase, if you want a quick snapshot of the sequence of events, this probably a good one:Wow. I\u2019m really struggling to view Coinbase\u2019s actions in anything but the harshest light.1. Deal with blockchain tracing firm2. Discover that firm selling client data3. Don\u2019t disclose this to anyone4. Buy a firm that is made up of human rights violators5. Profit?!? https://t.co/9om7HRxape\u2014 Riccardo Spagni (@fluffypony) March 3, 2019It seems as if Coinbase acquired Neutrino because their current providers were inept. And also selling client data to outside sources. Like pouring fat to the flames, in an interview on Friday in Cheddar, Head of International Sales Christine Sandler tried to justify the Coinbase decision.It\u2019s hard to understand a management mindset that could separate the atrocious actions of the company it acquired from the work it does. Harder still to understand how they could believe the wider community would. Perhaps they thought no one would make the connection?Neutrino Founders Also Head Up Hacking TeamHowever, it would soon come to light that the Neutrino founders also head up Hacking Team, a wholly unethical cyber intelligence firm identified by Reporters Without Borders as one of the five \u201ccorporate enemies of the Internet.\u201d Hardly a company the most trusted cryptocurrency exchange and custodian would want to be associated with.Hacking Team has been pivotal to a series of horrific events worldwide involving human rights violations, espionage, rigged government elections, and even murder. Hacking Team allegedly worked with the Saudi officials that later played a role in Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s death, for example.Perhaps it\u2019s unsurprising then that the chirpy Coinbase blog post announcing their latest bedfellows failed to spur the reaction they were expecting. They spoke of Neutrino\u2019s top talent and said the company would enable Coinbase to add more cryptocurrencies and protect its users:We\u2019re excited to welcome them to the Coinbase family!It seems their users were less so.#DeleteCoinbase \u2013 Or Finance Surveillance and MurderThe Coinbase team had clearly decided to focus on technology over talent. They turned a blind eye to the actions of its founders and hired Neutrino because they were the best, period.But the community failed to agree. They feel cheated, disgusted, lied to, and repulsed. The #DeleteCoinbase movement is gaining momentum.If you use Coinbase, now you are not only paying for your own surveillance but the salary of a person who contributed to the murder of journalists, targeting of minority populations, and spouse-ware around the world. https://t.co/fcjoTij8l9\u2014 Janine (@J9Roem) February 20, 2019And things only get worse.While the U.S. based exchange enthused over Neutrino\u2019s capabilities:Neutrino\u2019s technology is the best we\u2019ve encountered in this spaceKraken CEO Jesse Powell and his compliance team failed to agree. Neutrino wasn\u2019t the best. In fact, they found them to be decidedly subpar on product and highly risky as regards to an M&A:I asked our Compliance team what they thought of Neutrino. Fortunately, they'd just completed an evaluation. Neutrino came in last place on product (out of the 5) but was disqualified anyway due to the risks. However, other factors are important in M&A: cost, culture fit. pic.twitter.com/kiYh11GEBc\u2014 Jesse Powell (@jespow) March 3, 2019Leaked User DataIn that same interview with Cheddar, Sanders, while trying to reinforce the reasoning behind the Neutrino acquisition, let slip another key fact that upset users further.Its current provider was selling user data.There\u2019s a phrase we\u2019ve become familiar with. But not when it comes to the most trusted cryptocurrency custodian out there. She said:It was important for us to migrate away from our current providers\u2026 They were selling client data to outside sources and it was compelling for us to get control over that and have proprietary technology that we could leverage to keep the data safe and protect our clients.YOU DID WHAT?!?!A @coinbase official responds to #DeleteCoinbase by saying they had to acquire Neutrino because their previous tracking provider SOLD COINBASE CUSTOMER DATA TO THIRD PARTIESAnd that\u2019s why we should trust the people you choose to do business with?!?! https://t.co/XBb3ncHmxI\u2014 Udi Wertheimer (@udiWertheimer) March 3, 2019Can Coinbase Survive This Disaster?Blockchain technology is trustless. We need no third party or bank for peer-to-peer transactions in theory. However, with its current infrastructure (or lack thereof), we still need solutions like Coinbase to act as a trusted third party for fiat on-ramps.Up until now, Coinbase has proven worthy of user trust. They have managed clients\u2019 funds, acted responsibly, and compliantly\u2013more than can be said about most cryptocurrency exchanges.But now they\u2019re working with the orchestrators of mass oppression, human misery and human rights abuses. And they covered up the fact that user data had been sold. They\u2019re also making it impossible for users to completely delete accounts.So whether this will spur a mass exodus of users from Coinbase remains to be seen. Or, rather, a bunch of inactive accounts with no more than a few satoshis in.But it will certainly take time to repair the damage done and the woefully incompetent way it handled the scandal. Not to mention blatant abuse of user trust.Bitcoinist reached out to Coinbase for comment but did not receive a reply at press time.Do you use Coinbase? Are you deleting your account? Why or why not?

Some are taking a more supportive stance and some are unfortunately not.Over the weekend the SEC of Thailand gave an update that was a real head-scratcher, to say the least.They have removed support for Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, and Litecoin, and reaffirmed support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Stellar Lumens.More specifically, they were clear to specify that this support is referring to issuing tokens on top of those respective blockchains (ICOs) and using these cryptos as a base pair for trading at exchanges. Meaning, that it is now illegal to issue an ICO on the Litecoin blockchain and exchanges are banned from allowing pairs like ETC/XXX.Of course, of the three cryptos that have seen support removed, none of them are currently being used for ICOs nor are they being used by exchanges as a base currency. So by their own summation, they have are not having any real impact on the market.Thailand is a fairly small market so in any case, we shouldn\u2019t expect any real impact on crypto prices off the back of this announcement. What\u2019s interesting here is that they\u2019re actually doing their homework and getting into specific cryptos almost like an investor might.Only time will tell if this strategy will pay off but what is clear is that they may be creating more work for themselves as they may need to update the status of individual coins based on market forces. Should any single cryptoasset gain or lose ground in the market, they could be forced to update their policy. Also, they\u2019ve only weighed in on 7 cryptos, leaving the rest with a big question mark.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsCloser to a dealGet BuckedBTC transactions hit new highPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of March 4th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsStocks are strong this morning. The main narrative circulating financial media is that they\u2019re rising on the optimism of an upcoming US-China trade deal.From what it seems, the US is now willing to drop $200 billion in tariffs should a deal be reached. Still in question is whether those tariffs would be dropped gradually or all at once. No matter what the details, it seems like we\u2019ll be looking forward to a Trump-Xi summit to put a lid on this, possibly by the end of the month.Meanwhile, President Xi has more pressing matters on his hand as the ten-day, 3000 member, Chinese National Congress session kicks off tomorrow. We\u2019ll be watching closely for updates about the economic outlook, support for foreign investments, and of course the trade saga above.The China 50 index has been flying lately, it will be interesting to see if they can maintain momentum.Jawboning the BuckEver since his election, Donald Trump has done his best to put downward verbal pressure on the US Dollar. But his statements at a Maryland conference were a bit more confusing than usual.Trump also reiterated that the Fed was doing damage by raising rates too quickly, which is even more confusing given the Fed\u2019s recent shift in policy. Those of you who read regularly know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.In any case, the statements did seem to have some impact as the Dollar opened up the week with a small gap down (purple circle). However, the effects have since worn off and we\u2019re up by now.The stronger Dollar also seems to be having a negative effect on gold, which has fallen below the $1,300 mark.Crypto MarketsWhether or not due to a stronger dollar, it seems the crypto markets are decidedly in the red this morning.Volumes have subsided somewhat from the late February excitement and volatility remains subdued. Transactions on the world\u2019s favorite blockchain however, have seen yet another significant uptick as Bitcoin now processes an average of 4.05 transactions per second.We continue to monitor volumes in emerging markets and worth noting that the spike we recently saw from Indonesia seems to have sustained itself.The first monthly gain in half a year has not gone unnoticed and has even caught some mainstream attention.

In fact, many new Lighting Applications or \u2018LApps\u2019 have started to emerge for such as for online tipping and buying pizza, a payment that can be sent for a fee of less than one cent.Yesterday, Bitcoinist reported that major US retailer Kroger is now also considering accepting Lightning Network payments after abandoning Visa credit cards due to high merchant fees.While a long shot, LN has actually been found to be a few seconds slower than the best (centralized) digital payment solutions on the market such as Apple Pay, according to a recent study.

At today\u2019s price, those bitcoin are worth almost $63 million, with a record 25.16 billion VES spent just this week.Steady As She GoesBitcoinist has closely followed the increase in LocalBitcoins usage in Venezuela, a barometer of the economic instability in the country. After a whole year of steady increases, the bitcoin volume is now relatively stable, at around 2,000 BTC per month. This is a tenfold increase on January 2018, when Venezuelans were buying around 200 BTC per month through LocalBitcoins.Hyperinflation caused the demise of the previous Bolivar, as it became worthless almost as soon as it was printed. This caused citizens to flock to bitcoin in their droves, looking for a more stable store of value to preserve their wealth.The replacement, the Sovereign Bolivar, (VES) is still suffering rampant inflation, so the ATH this week actually represents a slight drop in terms of BTC according to figures from CoinDance.Control The FlowThe flow of wealth out of the Venezuelan economy and into bitcoin hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. President Maduro\u2019s government recently introduced a 15% fee on bitcoin remittances. Ostensibly to stem the flow, this looks more like a desperate attempt to profit from the trend, although it may not be enforceable on LocalBitcoins usage.The dire situation of the Venezuelan people has led to many attempts at providing much needed aid. One of the most imaginative of these from the cryptocurrency community, aims to raise $1 million through donations. Each donation removes one \u2018Sovereign Bolivar\u2019 note from a mural of Maduro\u2019s face, made up of them.Look To The FutureWhile the future of Maduro\u2019s government is uncertain, hopes are high for the self-declared interim president, Juan Guaid\u00f3. The leader of the political opposition, recognized by much of the world as the legitimate president, has decried Maduro\u2019s Petro cryptocurrency as a scam.He is also strongly pro-Bitcoin, having tweeted positive bitcoin news since at least 2014.

We take a look at what this means for the week ahead.BITCOIN PRICE ANALYSIS: WEEKLY CHARTThe weekly chart for bitcoin shows Bitcoin price 00 continuing to be locked within the trading range of $4100 and $3200, with only a few hours of trading $100 either side, for 15 weeks now.For the bulls, there are relatively positive signs in the weekly chart with bitcoin price printing higher lows and making an attempt at higher highs.The MAC-d is also crossed bullish with its signal line, and the histogram printing a higher high last week. The mac-d itself is still below zero but is trending upwards.Looking further at the Mac-d, not only is the mac-d crossed bullish, but it has built a double bullish divergence across a 12 month period. This is an unusual event, which as only occurred previously in March 2015. The key thing traders will look for is if the histogram can remain positive over the next weeks.The early rejection of the $3800 range on Monday would imply that BTC price will want to trade in this range for the next few days at least.DAILY CHARTThe daily chart shows that there is a cluster of support, which lies below for Bitcoin. The 100 and 50 DMA stand at around the 61.8% retracement level, with the 78.6% resting just above the $3500 handle, beneath which is the fast-rising 200-week moving average.The Daily Mac-d is crossed bearish and implies that there is more downside to be expected. The CMF, which incorporates both price and volume, shows that there is continued underlying buying pressure, but it has also been trending down since mid-February.Should Bitcoin price find support early in the week and subsequently trade above $3800 again, it would be a bullish sign and could imply the door would be reopened to re-testing $4200.Overall there is a mixed picture for Bitcoin price action:\u2013 lower timeframes suggest downside risk lies ahead, but on a macro level Bitcoin there are signs that Bitcoin does want to move higher if the bears fail to break 3k with conviction during March, which will be a critical month.Trade Bitcoin, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

Increased Bitcoin Tax Filing PalaverAs reported by Bitcoinist, part of the Bakkt launch will see the adoption of Bitcoin payment for coffee at Starbucks. Reports indicate that Starbucks had received a significant stake in Bakkt in exchange for allowing people to buy coffee with BTC.While the news signals a significant breakthrough in cryptocurrency adoption on the retail scene, commentators say there are potentially massive tax implications. Given that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) classifies Bitcoin as property, its potential use at Starbucks would mean calculating capital gains tax for every purchase.Commenting on the issue to MarketWatch, James Foust of Coin Center, said:If you were to use bitcoin to buy coffee, it is technically feasible, but it would be extremely burdensome for tax purposes. You\u2019d need to work out the fair market value [of a bitcoin] at the time [of a coffee purchase] versus the fair-market value [at tax-filing time], and you\u2019d need to itemize the gains or losses.Starbucks customers who pay with Bitcoin will have to keep receipts or some record of purchase to aid in their calculations come tax filing season. Given the already tedious nature of cryptocurrency tax filing, such an additional burden could severely hamper adoption.Working out the Kinks of Bitcoin AdoptionGiven the potential implications of BTC-enabled payments at Starbucks, some experts believe that modalities should be put in place to help (and not hinder) such adoption. One possible means of achieving such an outcome would be to adjust cryptocurrency tax laws.The IRS could create exemptions for cryptocurrency purchases, especially those dealing with microtransactions. The tax agency could introduce a reasonable upper cap for such transactions, meaning that purchases below that level constitute a write-off for tax purposes.Highlighting some of the possible steps that could be taken, Coin Center executive Jerry Brito opined:A better option might be to simply create a de minimis exemption for cryptocurrency the way it exists for foreign currency. The purpose would be to remove the friction and encourage the development of this innovative technology and its use in payments \u2014 something any member of Congress should be able to get behind.Do you think more streamlined Bitcoin tax laws by the IRS could solve the potential headache associated with using the cryptocurrency to pay for coffee at Starbucks?

The expert also holds that its distinction is going to make it appealing to investors in the upcoming years. Bitcoin\u2019s Bright FutureNiall Ferguson, a well-known economic historian and recognized author, spoke at The Australian Financial Review Business Summit which took place on March 5th and 6th in Sydney. The expert, who previously thought that Bitcoin (BTC) 00 is a \u201ccomplete delusion,\u201d now holds that it has a very bright future, stating:I was very wrong, wrong to think there was no use for a form of currency based on blockchain technology [\u2026] I don\u2019t think this is a complete delusion.Ferguson revealed that he first considered Bitcoin to be a delusion when his son suggested that he buy some five years ago. Later on, when the price of the cryptocurrency surged in late 2017, the historian says that he watched in despair.He also thinks that it is very important to understand that, despite the current decline of Bitcoin, it still remains far above its previous lows. He stated:Bitcoin is a bit like an option on digital gold.The historian also said that there is a bright future ahead for Bitcoin (BTC) because it\u2019s particularly distinct \u2014 and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make it attractive to investors.Not The First One to TurnNiall Ferguson is far from being the first prominent figure in the world of economics to turn positive on Bitcoin.Back in 2017, the Chairman and CEO of banking mogul JP Morgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, went all out on Bitcoin, saying that he\u2019d fire any trader working for him if he traded Bitcoin. At the time, he added:You can\u2019t have a business where people are going to invent a currency out of thin air. It won\u2019t end well\u2026 someone is going to get killed and then the government is going to come down on it.A few months later, however, the CEO pivoted on his position, admitting that he regrets making these claims.What is more, Ferguson is also not the first one to compare Bitcoin to gold. Serial entrepreneur and investor John Pfeffer said last year that Bitcoin is the \u201cfirst viable replacement for gold.\u201dProminent Bitcoin proponents Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have also expressed thoughts in the same lines:Taking bitcoin in isolation\u2026 we believe bitcoin disrupts gold. We think it\u2019s a better gold, if you look at the properties of money. And what makes gold gold? Scarcity. Bitcoin is actually fixed in supply so it\u2019s better than scarce\u2026 it\u2019s more portable, its fungible, it\u2019s more durable.

At the same time, TRON has fielded criticism over its marketing and value proposition. In a December interview, Stellar co-founder Jed McCaleb went as far as to describe Sun\u2019s platform as garbage. \u201cThings like Tron, it\u2019s just garbage. But people dump tons of money into it, these things that just do not technically work,\u201d he told Yahoo! Finance.

The two biggest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), have also seen significant (but smaller) gains in the past two days. Pump up the VolumeLitecoin started its latest ascent on Feb 8, with a price pump from $33 to $43 over 36 hours. At the same time, the 24-hour dollar volume almost tripled. Further mid-February gains saw the price briefly troubling the low-50s, before dropping back to $45.However, since Tuesday, the price has been rocketing once more \u2014 gaining $10 to reach $57. Again, this accompanied a boost in 24-hour volume, which almost doubled in the same period.Litecoin started the year at around $30 per coin.Why Now?According to Forbes, it may have something to do with initiatives in crisis-torn Venezuela. The government last month introduced sanctioned cryptocurrency remittances to the country in an attempt to profit from increasing bitcoin usage.The scheme allows remittances in bitcoins and litecoins, with resources available in sovereign bolivars once the transaction is confirmed. Whilst the commission listed is not the 15 percent first touted, it is still on a par with cash remittances, at 5.7 percent.Seems like a great way for Maduro\u2019s government to raise some much-needed funds through crypto. After all, it will just print some banknotes to fulfill the transaction \u2014 assuming the paper doesn\u2019t become too expensive.Anything Else?Forbes also points to recent partnerships to improve Litecoin\u2019s security and privacy, notably through the potential implementation of Mimblewimble. This protocol, named after a Harry Potter spell, increases fungibility and privacy while remaining scalable.There is also the impact of August\u2019s upcoming reward-halving event to consider. eToro\u2019s Mati Greenspan, explained:Litecoin\u2019s strong rally should not come as a surprise; it was high time the fast-paced growth of the community and user base was priced in. Investors may also have one eye on litecoin\u2019s upcoming reward halving event, so it\u2019s likely they\u2019re already pricing in the supply reduction.Whilst Litecoin (LTC) is still 85 percent down from its all-time high, consolidation of (and building on) recent gains could see it well placed for future movement.What do you think of Litecoin\u2019s recent price gains?

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, better known as the OECD has slashed its forecasts for global growth even more drastically than the IMF. The Paris based institution has reduced its outlook for global GDP by two notches from 3.5% to 3.3%.While markets are optimistic about possible upcoming trade deals between China and the US, the US and Europe, and the outcome of Brexit, the impact of these existing situations is already smothering the world\u2019s economy. Not to mention if any of those risks should materialize.We hope that these tensions are resolved in the next couple of months but remain cautious in case they are not.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsECB Day!In-depth view of LitecoinPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of March 7th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsToday, the European Central Bank (ECB) will deliver their interest rate decision followed by a press conference with their Governor Mario Draghi.There are a slew of central bank announcements this month and the ECB is the first major one. After completely ending their QE program at the start of the year, investors want to know if and when they plan to start raising interest rates.Given the recent capitulation from the US Fed and the rising risk of a no-deal Brexit, we can probably expect Super Mario to echo Powell\u2019s tone of \u2018patience\u2019 and possibly add the word \u2018caution\u2019. Both of which markets tend to adore because it means more support in the short term.As Draghi takes the stage at 1:30 PM GMT, our eyes will be on the EURUSD, which has been building itself a meaningful level of support at 1.1250. A break of which could very well lead to a strong Dollar swing throughout the markets.In-depth view on LitecoinFollowing a recent argument with one of my favorite trolls, I decided to do a little bit more digging into Litecoin and how people are using it.This graph shows the number of transactions on the Litecoin blockchain, which has remained remarkably stable at 20k transactions per day (TPD) since last April.My claim that this shows a minimum level of real-world usage and possibly a bottom in the market was quickly refuted by my friend Udi, who argued that approximately 100% of $LTC transactions are due to speculation.Now, I\u2019m pretty sure this is not true. Firstly, because I\u2019ve done a full in-depth research on Litecoin. Secondly, because I\u2019ve personally bought things irl with Litecoin and have witnessed others paying with Litecoin.So, I decided to look into it further and see if we can get some numbers. To start, I posted this poll urging only Litecoin people to respond\u2026Now, admittedly the sample is pretty small and of the 308 responses, we need to immediately discount 160 (52%). Of the remaining 148 people, about 69 people seem to be using it purely for speculation, while 49 people are also using it as a means of payment.Still, these numbers aren\u2019t exactly concrete. So, I reached out to a few payment processing companies that deal with Litecoin. Of three main companies one of them was willing to give me usable stats. CoinGate.com claims that they are processing about 1,200 to 1,400 transactions a month in Litecoin. At best this is about 0.25% of the total TPD.One person pointed out a unique use-case for Litecoin, feeding chickens!!It seems someone actually jerry-rigged their coup to feed their brood with crypto payments sent from strangers. This innovation of unique crypto Internet entertainment seems to be accounting for between 3 and 30 TPD.Still, the number one real-world usage of Litecoin it seems is as a settlement method for cryptotraders. For people who often send money from exchange to exchange to private wallets, it\u2019s much cheaper and faster to do this with Litecoin than it is with Bitcoin.This is why it indeed deserves the title \u201cdigital silver\u201d and with the upcoming halving event in early August, which is likely why it\u2019s been outperforming the rest of the crypto markets lately.The only coin that\u2019s been doing better than LTC is Binance Coin, which has just overtaken Tether for the number 7 spot by market cap and currently nipping at the heels of Bitcoin Cash.Wishing you an excellent day ahead!Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalystYour Social Investment Network \u2013 www.eToro.comeToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

It appears to be earnest in its belief that its findings are shocking. Apparently, there\u2019s a wave of young people influenced by \u201cfriends and social media celebrities\u201d who are busy buying up Bitcoin and other crypto assets in an effort to \u201cget rich quick.\u201d Someone should inform the BBC that Bitcoin is in its longest bear market since it began a decade ago.

Time for Bitcoin Users in Canada to Pay Their TaxesAccording to an article in Forbes yesterday, Bitcoin researcher and writer Kyle Torpey revealed that the CRA is cracking down on Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto-asset users in Canada. Torpey says that \u201cmultiple sources\u201d have confirmed the crackdown from the Canadian equivalent of the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Those users currently in the eye of the CRA have received a 13-page questionnaire with no less than 54 questions and sub-questions.A media representative at the CRA commented on the clampdown, stating:The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) understands that a vast majority of middle-class Canadians pay their fair share, but it remains committed to ensuring that without exception, every taxpayer abides by the same tax laws. The contact also assured that the CRA was \u201ckeeping pace\u201d with developments in the cryptocurrency industry. In fact, the Canadian tax authority actually established a dedicated cryptocurrency unit in 2017 to build intelligence and conduct audits. It also reinforced that anyone thinking of using bitcoin as a way of evading taxes had better think again:The CRA is also committed to helping taxpayers understand their tax obligations when using digital currencies, and to remind them that using digital currency does not exempt consumers from their tax obligations.Bitcoin users in Canada are being targeted with audits by the Canada Revenue Agency (federal tax agency). Attached are some images of the questionnaire being sent out to individuals in relation to the audits.Full story here: https://t.co/dzRXsdh3TH pic.twitter.com/HFNVo2op29\u2014 Kyle Torpey (@kyletorpey) March 7, 2019 Following a Similar Path to the IRSBitcoin users in the United States are already familiar with the risks of being a target of the tax authorities. In Feb 2018, the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) forced the Coinbase exchange to hand over information about its users. Coinbase fought the order in court. However, the company still had to hand over data on 13,000 of its customers to the IRS.In Canada, there are currently more than 60 active cryptocurrency audits right now. However, the contact could not confirm who was being targeted.The Audit Process Includes a Lengthy QuestionnaireThe audit from the CRA will come as a headache to many bitcoin users north of the border. Canadian authorities have been somewhat more lenient on Bitcoin regulation until now. As part of the auditing process, digital asset users will have to answer 54 questions and sub-questions about their movements in the cryptocurrency space in recent years.Part of the clampdown is to flush out money laundering. One of the questions pertains to the use of tumblers and mixing services. These are notably used to protect user privacy and, well, obfuscate the origins of cryptocurrency funds.Changelly and ShapeShift both come up in the questionnaire as well, as two key exchanges without KYC. While ShapeShift implemented KYC in quarter three of last year, Changelly still requires nothing more than an email.There\u2019s also a section dedicated to peer-to-peer transactions from sites like Localbitcoins. As AML clampdowns come later in the year in the shape of FATF requirements, exchanges, wallet providers, and sites like Localbitcoins will be required to collect more user information if they pertain to a member state. This includes the US, EU, and members of the G20.G20 Leaders committed to \"regulate #crypto-assets for anti-#moneylaundering and countering the financing of terrorism in line with FATF standards\". \u27a1\ufe0f FATF Report to the #G20 Leaders' Summit https://t.co/ZZECBoAZSc pic.twitter.com/njbTxzH8TL\u2014 FATF (@FATFNews) December 3, 2018The questionnaire also asks users whether they have participated in initial coin offerings (ICOs), cryptocurrency mining, or generated passive income through node-related operations.

Since last week, the former is up 28 percent. Prices are now at the highest they\u2019ve been since October 2018 and the altcoin appears set to notch $70 over the short-term.1-HR ChartThe $55 to $56 zone is providing some push back. In late February, gains above $54 proved futile and Litecoin (LTC) dropped 20 percent after topping out at $53.41. At the time of writing, LTC has pulled back from $58.71, dropping out of the ascending channel and below the 12 and 26 EMA to rest on top of the 50 MA at $55.25. Litecoin is likely taking a moment to consolidate and regather strength after traders took profits near $58. Traders should keep an eye for LTC to cross above the 20MA on the Bollinger Band indicator. A move above the upper arm at $57.51 would bring the altcoin closer to re-entering the ascending channel at $58. Weekly ChartThe weekly chart shows Litecoin as the lead bull, as it has sustained well and is now completing its fifth week above the long-term descending trendline.

Amazon: We \u2018Saw Opportunity\u2019As Bloomberg reported, quoting a statement from Amazon, the company wants to increase returns at the heart of its e-commerce operations. This has involved fundamentally altering the supply line, forcing even long-time sellers to sell products directly on its marketplace instead of using Amazon as a middleman.This, reports say, results in reduced costs, as suppliers themselves foot the bill for issues such as storage and shipping. Amazon also takes a commission from each transaction.\u201cWe regularly review our selling partner relationships and may make changes when we see an opportunity to provide customers with improved selection, value and convenience,\u201d the statement reads.The knock-on effect for suppliers, perhaps predictably, has already touched a nerve. As Bloomberg notes, given purchase orders agreed months in advance, seismic changes from Amazon can easily trigger chaos.\u201cIf you\u2019re heavily reliant on Amazon, which a lot of these vendors are, you\u2019re in a lot of trouble. If this goes on, it can put people out of business,\u201d the publication quoted Dan Brownsher, CEO of a consultancy counting around 50 Amazon vendors among its clients, as saying.At press time, Amazon\u2019s share price was down by close to three percent on the day.Can Decentralization Tackle Monopolies?As Amazon has grown to achieve a practically worldwide monopoly, the perils of relying on a giant centralized partner will ring true for those businesses which have adopted an alternative ethos.Nonetheless, decentralized marketplaces have yet to achieve widespread popularity. Efforts to take on the e-commerce giants have so far seen little progress, with highly-anticipated offerings such as OpenBazaar failing to dent consumer habits. \u201cYou should be able to buy and sell using cryptocurrency\u2026 if you get crypto, you should be able to spend it\u2026 you and buy whatever you need for your daily activity,\u201d the platform\u2019s founder, Washington Sanchez, told cryptocurrency advocate Tatiana Moroz\u2019s podcast the Tatiana Show in January.

Better BetaThis is based on ether\u2019s higher volatility compared to Bitcoin and the tendency for all cryptocurrencies to move in unison. The beta measurement of a cryptocurrency is related to volatility, and over the past six months, ether\u2019s has been greater. Notes the report:ETH has also been significantly more volatile than BTC over the last six months. It\u2019s 90-day beta relative to BTC is currently 1.5, substantially higher than its historical average.Chart courtesy of Delphi Digital.Crypto CorrelationIn general, altcoins like Ethereum tend to follow Bitcoin\u2019s price movements \u2014 and this tendency has been increasing of late.Historically, there have been instances of coins which have bucked this trend but these are exceptions rather than the rule. If anything, altcoins tend to fall further in bear markets but can rise faster in bull markets.For the past eighteen months, Ethereum has experienced downside volatility compared to Bitcoin. However, the report suggests that this could be changing.We are\u2026 beginning to see upside volatility pick up for ETH. Given the extremely high intra-market correlations we previously discussed, this is a trend we are monitoring closely as ETH may be poised to outperform if BTC rallies.When Bull?Whether we see Ethereum outperform Bitcoin in the short term is anybody\u2019s guess. Now that the Constantinople hard fork is complete, we may actually start to see its volatility decrease a little.We have certainly seen ether mirroring the rest of the altcoin market over the past few days with impressive gains, although not nearly as impressive as Litecoin\u2019s.

After a sharp $150 (4%) decline and subsequent sharp reversal, we take a look at the charts to try and get the lay of the land before the close. MONTHLY CHARTBitcoin price 00 opened the month at $3360 and managed to reach towards $4200 last week before suffering a setback on Sunday where the bears managed to take control while the bulls were taking profits and pushed BTC price back towards $3700.The monthly chart shows that the bulls have managed to control the price action for the month, with there being more demand than supply in the low $3000s where the 50-week moving average lies as initial support, as it did during January 2015 after the 85% decline.The MAC-D, which is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA, is still trending down and has some way to go before crossing above the signal (9-day EMA) and baselines to indicate that there is a longer-term shift in the market.However, there is the first sign of the MAC-D histogram printing indicating declining bearish momentum. The histogram serves to show the distance between the MAC-D and the signal line and as such, when it is in decline, it illustrates that there is some movement towards a bullish cross of the two.Although this is a good sign, there is some way to go.DAILY CHARTThe daily chart shows a conflicting picture. The drop from $4200 has been supported, initially by the 100-day moving average and following an aggressive dump overnight to $3658, quickly reversed off the 61.8% retracement, forming a pin bar reversal candle on the daily, which is bullish.Having said that, the MAC-d has crossed its signal line bearish (but above the baseline) and there is some minor bearish divergence on the CMF.The combination of these two technical aspects has traders at odds more so than usual as to the direction of travel expected.4-HOUR CHARTSLooking at the order flow charts as provided by Tensor Charts, we are able to visualize where there may be areas of support or resistance based on volume density and size of orders for a given price range.As illustrated by the colored blocks, we can see that at Bitstamp, there is a cluster of support below the current price of $3819, which will serve to somewhat support the bullish case.But the darker yellow areas above price illustrate that there are large sell orders already placed around $4050, which will serve as some resistance and will require strong bullish momentum at the top of the move to break through.We can see how this occurred last time the bulls knocked at the door of $3700 and $4000 and subsequently became a block too far for the bulls at $4200.The chart also serves to illustrate that Bids within 10 percent of the price range, exceed those of the Asks, which at face value, would indicate that there is more buying interest than selling interest at these prices.It is likely that there will be a bullish or bearish move as we move into the Monthly candle close and the current bulls vs. bears battle will be settled before the end of the week.Trade Bitcoin, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

However, this still comprises only 1.7 percent of all money laundering investigations.Cryptocurrency Money Laundering Up Tenfold in JapanAccording to The Japan Times, the NPA reports that it recorded 7,096 cases of suspected cryptocurrency money laundering. This figure represents a tenfold increase from the 669 cases reported between April and December 2017.Back in early December 2018, the NPA released a report stating that alleged cases of cryptocurrency money laundering for the year stood at almost 6,000. At the time, the period accounted for was between January 2018 and October 2018.Since Q2 2017, regulators have required cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan to report instances of suspected illegal virtual currency transactions. This move was part of a whole host of reforms targeted at combating illicit activities carried out via digital currencies.The NPA says many of the suspicious transactions involved multiple accounts with different bio-data information but using the same photo ID. Other cases involved accounts using foreign IPs even though details of the accounts show listing addresses based in Japan.According to the NPA\u2019s figures, the increase in crypto-related money laundering is indicative of a general rise in illegal financial transactions across the board in 2018. The NPA says it recorded more than 417,000 cases of alleged money laundering, an increase of over 17,000 from 2017.Also, the percentage of crypto-related money laundering in the general reckoning has also increased. In 2018, 1.70 percent of money laundering was from cryptocurrency transactions compared to 0.16 percent in 2017.Robust KYC/AML/CFT Rules to the RescueIn August 2018, reports emerged that the NPA was set to commit more than $300,000 to develop a tracking software for cryptocurrency transaction. The NPA plans to implement this tool as a way of combating the rise of cryptocurrency theft and other illegal transactions.As reported by Bitcoinist in January 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) regulations on cryptocurrency will come into effect by Q3 2019. These regulations which center around KYC/AML protocols will apply to the G20, of which Japan is a member.Experts believe such international standards will hinder the ability for criminals to launder money via cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the country\u2019s Financial Services Agency (FSA) continues to implement stricter regulatory standards for cryptocurrency exchanges based in Japan.Do you think the introduction and enforcement of KYC/AML regulations will curb money laundering?

As you may recall, the Federal Tax Service had finally revealed the bombshell, that Bitcoin was legally a foreign currency. By this point though, the story had become so drawn out and confused by plot twists, that all but the most hardcore fans had stopped watching long before.Despite this, way back in December 2016, the \u2018Quest for the Regulatory Bill\u2019 began. Sadly, it soon became clear it would be just as confusing and unwieldy as its predecessor.The first season passed with barely any storyline at all. The first draft of the regulatory bill only made an appearance in December 2017\u2019s season finale. Season two saw the government demand major revisions, but the second half of the story started to plod, and there was no real satisfying conclusion.Season Three To Be Series Swan-song?The Spring session of the state Duma (lower house of Russian parliament) runs from January until July 2019. The cryptocurrency thread was initially expected to play out by April, although the writers have already delayed this, due to technical and legal problems.But now, with Russian president, Vladimir Putin, stepping in to demand a conclusion by 1st July, the team must surely up their game. After all, what Putin says\u2026\u2026although, perhaps not? Putin originally intervened in the plot back in December 2017, also demanding a resolution by July the following year. And we all know that didn\u2019t happen.\u2018Crypto-Sphere\u2019 TeasersThe Federal Council have already expressed their dissatisfaction with the slowness of the lower chamber. Speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko openly demanded the Duma accelerate the amendment and adoption of the law.No doubt, like the rest of us, he was eager to see the start of the final part of the trilogy, \u2018Crypto-Sphere\u2019. We have already had several teasers of what is to come. From an alleged $10 billion government crypto-investment, to the promise of a \u2018Petro-like\u2019 oil-backed state cryptocurrency.But first, we need the \u2018Quest for the Regulatory Bill\u2019 to conclude.$2 Billion Budget LostIf nothing else, the regulation might finally plug a large hole in the budget. Following Putin\u2019s intervention, the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain (RAKIB), claimed that in the last 18 months, the Russian economy has lost about $2 billion due to its lack of cryptocurrency regulation.This, they claim, comprises three main components:Commissions from Russian miners being paid to foreign intermediaries.The outflow of Russian developers and specialists to foreign jurisdictions.The growth of blockchain-related startups, working within the regulations.Let\u2019s hope Putin\u2019s involvement makes a difference, and we finally find out what the future Russian crypto landscape will look like this time.Will Russia finally pass its cryptocurrency law this summer?

Bitcoinist | Feb 28, 2019 | 16:00 Share Tweet Send Share Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market for that matter have had a tumultuous 2018. Prices plummeted throughout 2018, with the cryptocurrency market losing over $700 billion of its market capitalization while Bitcoin trades about 75 below its all-time high value of early 2018. With prices as low as they are, many hold an opinion that bottom might finally be in. Are We There Yet?Towards the beginning of 2018 Bitcoin (BTC) 00 reached its all-time high value of around $20,000. The digital currency was at the peak of an unprecedented bull run which span across the entire cryptocurrency market which, at the time, had a market cap upwards of $800 billion.What followed was a severe reversal, seeing Bitcoin drop to its current level of less than $4,000, marking a decline of almost 80 percent.The cryptocurrency market shrank from the whopping $800 billion in market capitalization to about $134 billion at the time of this writing.It\u2019s also worth noting that Bitcoin\u2019s current downtrend is the longest since the one which took place between December 2013 and January 2015.However, with prices being as low as they are, many industry experts, including former Wall Street hedge fund manager and popular bitcoin proponent Mike Novogratz and the founder and CEO at Digital Currency Group Barry Silbert, have said that the bottom is in.Others, such as the co-founder of Union Square Ventures, Fred Wilson, hold that 2019 will be the year when the cryptocurrency market will bottom out and we will enter a new bull run.Catching the Bottom: Paramount for TradingIdentifying the end of a market downtrend results in an opportunity to invest around the asset\u2019s lowest point. Which would suggest that you\u2019re minimizing your potential losses and maximizing your future profits? Identifying market movement correctly is especially important when trading CFDs or other leveraged trading products on a trading platform like Evolve Markets.Finding the bottom, however, is definitely not as easy. For example, both Novogratz and Silbert\u2019s mentioned bottom positions turned out to be wrong as the market collapsed further after their statements.The Relevance of % Drop From ATH in 2017As we mentioned above, Bitcoin dropped with a little bit less than 80 percent from its ATH in late 2017.As it turns out, though, this is not the biggest drop of the cryptocurrency. In November 2011, BTC lost about 94 percent of its value.On November 19th, 2013, the prices tumbled in a single day as Bitcoin lost over half of its value in 24 hours. Between 2013 and 2015, Bitcoin had lost 87 percent of its price.It\u2019s also worth noting that every time Bitcoin has bottomed, it has come up swinging, marking a new all-time high value. If history is any indicator, the next bull run for the cryptocurrency might see it surging past the last ATH of around $20,000.VolumeVolume is also an essential indicator to look for in order to potentially identify Bitcoin\u2019s bottom. As Bitcoinist reported earlier this week, Bitcoin managed to break out of a ten-day consolidation above $3,500.The aforementioned trading session was also backed by serious volumes. In fact, it was the biggest session of 2019.This is officially the biggest session of 2019 pic.twitter.com/7MAsQPWb1O\u2014 skew (@skew_markets) February 18, 2019In addition, there has been an unprecedented spike in the USD trading volume on LocalBitcoins. It quadrupled during the week ending on February 16, seeing over $31.5M worth of bitcoin traded on the platform.Institutions Begin to Line UpOne of the reasons for which the market sentiment might be changing is because reliable and recognized traditional institutions are getting more involved in the market.Fidelity\u2019s Bitcoin custody solution is set to launch in March. In addition, Bakkt \u2013 the digital asset trading platform owned by the operator of the New York Stock Exchange \u2013 the Intercontinental Exchange, is also close to its launch pending regulatory approval.Prominent institutional investment firm Cambridge Associates said that it\u2019s high-time investors started to consider cryptocurrencies. At the same time, we already saw the first US public pensions to invest $40 million in a cryptocurrency fund.Naturally, catching the bottom is just one of the ways to go in terms of trading, You can always wait it out and look for strong indicators that the bearish trend has reversed into a bullish one.In the end, it\u2019s important to note that even if bitcoin is forming its bottom, this doesn\u2019t automatically mean the start of a new bull run. The market doesn\u2019t necessarily have to follow the patterns from previous market cycles. It\u2019s also true that some traders warn that it might take years for some of the catalysts to come and to cause a major market uptrend. This, however, would provide traders with an opportunity to pursue profits while trading other markets such as commodities or forex while accumulating more bitcoin before the market starts its definite uptrend.Alternatively, not every analyst agrees the bear market is over. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible a failure to revisit the 3100 low and access orders at 3000 could trigger a short covering rally towards a breaking point to gather liquidity required to resume the downtrend,\u201d said David Grossman from Evolve Markets.Tone Vays, a Content Creator, Derivatives Trader and Consultant who frequently publishes his Trading Bitcoin show on YouTube, believes bitcoin has not found a bottom and any rally above the December 2018 low to the 4500-5100 level would be a selling opportunity before an all-time low is found later this year.Tyler Jenks at Lucid Investments, a pioneer for the \u201cHyperwave\u201d technical strategy and frequent guest on Tone Vays\u2019s \u2018Trading Bitcoin,\u2019 is forecasting Bitcoin to target $1000 with an open-ended timeframe based on his Hyperwave Strategy.If we exceed $4,200 on a weekly closing basis then price will rise to the next resistance, maybe $4,800-$5,100, which has been Tone's target for weeks. If that occurs it still doesn't change my $1,000 target. I am not interested in playing counter-trend bounces in a bear market.\u2014 Tyler Jenks (@LucidInvestment) February 24, 2019Do you think we\u2019ve seen Bitcoin bottom?

Firstly, that the CoinShares Chief Strategy Officer and Blockchain Council member speaks Turkish (who knew?). And secondly, that the Turks own more cryptocurrency than any other European nation. (If you consider Turkey a European nation, of course).Turks Own More Cryptocurrency at 18% of the CountryFrom what the author could gather from Google Translate, Demirors declares that she is proud to be Turkish, based on the ING findings that 18% of Turks own cryptocurrency. This is much higher than the overall 9% average.She also pays tribute to the great success of startups and investors in the country. However, there may be a few more reasons why Turkish people are holding onto digital assets.For one thing, bitcoin may be volatile, but so is the country\u2019s currency, the lira. In fact, even as bitcoin racked up record losses last November, trading volume on Turkish exchanges shot up by 37 percent.The Turkish lira crisis involving dollar-denominated debt that took place last summer greatly devalued many Turkish families\u2019 life savings. They also saw their pensions and investments significantly affected.We may not be talking about the likes of Venezuela, but the lira did lose 20% of its value from one day to the next on August 10. Erdogan\u2019s Turkey may be creating the perfect storm for cryptocurrencies.With a dwindling economy and devalued national currency, it\u2019s hardly surprising that Turkey takes the lead in cryptocurrency ownership. In fact, the anonymous co-owner of Bitcoin.org tweeted about the huge surge in traffic from Turkish investors in August, saying this is how Bitcoin takes over the world:There\u2019s been a MASSIVE 42% increase in visitors to https://t.co/OsFgRFRRZb from Istanbul as the Turkish Lira plummets. This is how Bitcoin takes over the world, not through ETF\u2019s and \u201cHODL\u201d, but through replacing fiat currencies as they fall apart!\u2014 C\u00f8bra (@CobraBitcoin) August 13, 2018Turkey Is Ripe For Bitcoin AdoptionBesides the crumbling economy and fluctuating lira, according to computer science professor at Cornell University Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, culture plays a large role in the Turkish appetite for bitcoin.Not only does the country have a much younger population than the rest of Europe, but they are particularly open to new technology. Moreover, he says that financial schemes with high-profit margins are naturally attractive to Turks. This means the Turks own more cryptocurrency not only as a means of payment but also as a speculative asset.As for Erdogan, he has not made cryptocurrency illegal in the country. However, he has tried to persuade citizens to convert their dollars into lira, rather than bitcoin. The state religious authority Diyanet also decreed that Muslims should not trade in cryptos.When Turcoin turned out to be a Ponzi scheme, this gave more fodder for both their arguments. But while the Turkish people are not oblivious to cryptocurrency scams, neither are they blind to the erratic behavior of their government, nor the volatility of their national currency.So, while Demirors may be right about cryptocurrency startups, it seems there are plenty of other factors steering the Turks towards investing in bitcoin.Will Turkey become a hotbed for cryptocurrency adoption?

Also, the Thai SEC maintained that its decision would have no impact on investors judging from the fact that crypto exchanges in the country do not list the blacklisted tokens as base pairs and ICOs were yet to take off in the country.Back in August 2018, Bitcoinist reported that about 50 ICO projects had signaled interest in obtaining licenses from the SEC. From May 2018, regulators in the country began to take steps to create clear-cut regulations for Thailand\u2019s cryptocurrency market.Thailand: SEC Wants Standardized Data SubmissionConcerning the establishment of a robust regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, the Thai SEC is also set to revamp the reporting standards for cryptocurrency businesses. The regulatory watchdog issued a press statement on Friday (March 1, 2019) calling on stakeholders to provide input on a proposed standardized set of rules for data submission by cryptocurrency brokers and exchange platforms.According to the press release, the SEC requires two data classes \u2013 transaction data and profile data. Transaction data will encompass trading volume, deposits, withdrawals, and price among others. For profile data, the Thai SEC says it is interested in wallet addresses, account numbers, and other information about token issuers.Commenting on the need for a standard set of rules for data submission in the industry, the Thai SEC said:A standardized database would not only benefit the supervision of digital asset businesses but would also promote cooperation between business operators and the SEC in optimizing the use of relevant data to create a clear picture of the overall digital asset industry, laying out digital asset market development plan, as well as solving problems and preventing risks.The Thai SEC says stakeholders have until March 13, 2019, to submit their opinions on the matter.Why do you think the Thailand blacklisted these three cryptocurrencies?

Can you help us unravel the Curious Case of Cotton's Coins?https://t.co/BurmEMKVku\u2014 Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) February 28, 2019In a blog post published yesterday, the U.S. based exchange says that its mission is to:Accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrency so that the world can benefit from greater financial freedom and inclusion.

Not just your run-of-the-mill hack or exit scam. No, the Canadian QuadrigaCX exchange story was all the more sensational. A death, suspended operations, and access to the company\u2019s cold storage wallets lost forever. The knowledge was supposedly taken with CEO Gerald Cotten to his grave.Yet, there are more holes in this unlikely story that a factory of Swiss cheese. That a cryptocurrency exchange of such magnitude would grant one person with sole access to its users\u2019 funds is improbable at best, blisteringly stupid at worst. As Kraken points out:Some say the events and circumstances surrounding this case are too suspicious to be believed. Moreover, since the declaration of this news, many have suggested that there was no evidence of any cold wallet storage at all. 2016: 0x0ee4e2d (blue)Biggest outgoing TXs go to:\u2013 A Bitfinex Deposit Address #1 (red)\u2013 0x027beef (green)\u2013 0xb6aac (purple) pic.twitter.com/jsPOnIADGI\u2014 Taylor Monahan (@tayvano_) February 4, 2019And even that transactions have been made using the missing QuadrigaCX coins.Shedding Light on the MysteryIn the true spirit of the crusading exchange that wants to make the world a better place, Kraken is on a mission to shed some light on the missing QuadrgaCX coins.

Yesterday, the Kremlin put out a statement from President Putin who has issued a hard deadline of July 1st, just five months from now, for the full regulation of digital assets and cryptocurrencies. It seems as if Russia is now rushing to get involved in all aspects of this new market including bitcoin trading, ICOs, mining operations and so on.Some economists are already casting doubts about the sustainability of US debt and the viability of the US Dollar as the global reserve currency. Yesterday we even explored how the US Federal Reserve has provided evidence that the current trajectory is cause for concern.Russia and several other countries are not happy with the status quo and have been advocating for some level of de-dollarization for a long time. We can only speculate at this point whether or not the legalization of crypto is part of that strategy.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsNo Deal with N KoreaFour Terabytes of EOSEthereum Upgrade TonightPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of February 28th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsThe meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong Un ended abruptly this morning and no deal was reached. The tone from the President is still positive as he feels that a deal could eventually be reached but in any negotiations, \u201csometimes you need to walk away.\u201dFocus will soon shift back to the negotiations between the US and China. It seems that Trump and Xi will be meeting soon at Trump\u2019s resort in Mar-a-Lago.Indeed, the entire episode that we witnessed this morning in Vietnam seems to be a precursor to the Xi meetings. By walking away from Kim, Trump has greatly strengthened his reputation of being willing to walk out if he doesn\u2019t get what he wants. In the press Hanoi conference, Trump even claimed that the current tariffs are improving economic conditions back home and weakening coinditions in China.Manufacturing data out of China last night seem to back this claim\u2026Also worth mentioning today is that the GBPUSD is rising on the hope that Brexit will be delayed. However, the delay is still far from a certainty.Also, watch out for US GDP figures that will be released an hour before the opening bell.Four TerabytesA few days ago it was reported that about $7 million worth of EOS was stolen due to an update that didn\u2019t go so smoothly. Allegedly the funds were transferred to the Huobi exchange who soon blacklisted and locked down the tokens.Bugs happen in software and it\u2019s good to see that this situation was rectified pretty quickly, but another issue cropping up lately around EOS is the growing size of the blockchain, which now stands at around four terabytes.Now, this isn\u2019t a lot of storage space when we compare it to the data centers of Google, or Amazon, or even some governments. However, the deeper issue is that the network does not seem to be properly incentivizing participants to store the data.At present, there are only two block producers who are storing the entire amount of data, which could be causing strain on the network. I\u2019m not terribly worried about this as the dev team does seem to have a fix in the pipeline and EOS has been outperforming the rest of the crypto market over the last month, but I did feel it relevant to bring to your attention given my recent bullish statements on EOS.Constantinople TonightTonight the Ethereum network will undergo an essential update that could potentially alter the economics of the token. We\u2019ve discussed this in several updates already but I did want to summarize again what we know.From what it seems the issuance of new Ethereum tokens is about to be reduced drastically, which could very well reduce the rate of overall inflation. Historically, Ethereum adds about 20,000 to 30,000 new tokens per day. Over the last two weeks, this number has dropped to about 13,000.Constantinople is set to stabilize block rewards and further reduce the incoming supply to about 11,000 to 11,500 per day. This is approximately half the average levels seen throughout 2017 and 2018 and about a third the levels of 2016.However, we also know that the fee structure is going to be altered to make the network more efficient. So it\u2019s entirely possible that demand could be reduced as well. We\u2019ll need to wait and see.A recent figure from a new site called Defi Pulse estimates that about $321 million worth of Ether is currently locked in smart contracts. Even though this is about 2.25% of the total market cap, we do need to consider that a large portion of new tokens will be taken out of immediate circulation as a store of value, so even if the new fees structure does decrease demand somewhat, there\u2019s a limit to how much bottom line inflation will be impacted.Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t really a tradable event but more something for long term investors \u201cHodlers\u201d to consider.

The survey, of 740+ global tech leaders across twelve countries, shows an increasing belief that blockchain will change the industry.Don\u2019t Mind The DisruptionNearly half of the respondents (76 percent of whom are C-level executives) thought that blockchain was \u2018very likely\u2019 or \u2018likely\u2019 to change their business within three years.24 percent of respondents were neutral, and 27 percent felt this was \u201cnot likely\u201d or \u201cnot at all likely.\u201dFor comparison, in last year\u2019s survey, a similar 28 percent of participants said blockchain was unlikely to disrupt their business within three years, or were unsure. However, last year 42 percent of respondents were neutral on the matter, with only 30 percent thinking this was \u201cvery likely.\u201dSo while it seems that hardcore blockchain naysayers are still saying \u201cnay,\u201d a large chunk of the neutrals have swung. The belief in blockchain\u2019s potential to disrupt the tech industry is clearly growing.Disruption? What Disruption?On the question of which areas of business the blockchain was most likely to disrupt, the spread was very similar to last year.27 percent of respondents foresaw most disruption in internet of things (IoT) processes, such as software upgrades, product refills, and warranties. 22 percent thought the most disruption would be to trading (through platforms for small businesses).There was a slight swing away from \u201creduction of risk\u201d (20 percent) towards disruption of contracts (18 percent). The latter gained 4 percent of the total respondents from the former, compared to last year.According to Damien Ducourty, Co-founder of B9lab:There are possible use cases in everything from supply-chain (where IoT features heavily) to entertainment. The supply chain use case is one of the most obvious ones because of blockchains\u2019 supposed immutability, and the ability to verify transactions in a trustless environment.Challenges And BenefitsKey challenges highlighted in adopting blockchain technology included unproven business cases, complexity of the technology, and lack of capital for investment.However, the perceived benefits of implementing blockchain centred around improved business efficiency and cost reduction.There was an additional belief that blockchain implementation would differentiate their company\u2019s product and/or service. And almost 10 percent of respondents cited business insight gained from incremental data as their top benefit.Jehan Chu, Co-founder and Managing Partner at Kenetic and Co-founder of Social Alpha Foundation, summed up:In the 9 years since bitcoin was invented, blockchain experiments launched a thousand ships. In 2019, we are seeing the first of those ships land, and we expect waves of successful proofs of concept to demonstrate true value and utility from payments to data security to supply chain which will turn the tide towards mainstream adoption.Do you agree with the KPMG survey that blockchain will disrupt business models?

Except him, of course, as he doesn\u2019t intend to spend or sell any.Furthermore, Starbucks has apparently received \u2018significant\u2019 equity in Bitcoin futures platform, Bakkt, to accept in-store bitcoin payments this year.Improvement On FiatThe growth of Bitcoin use in high-inflation economies is another factor of concern for the incumbents, according to Ellis:(Cryptocurrency systems) core design characteristics \u2014 which are aimed at enabling \u2018freedom of money\u2019 \u2014 are in direct contrast to the characteristics of most traditional, private payment systems.She suggests that the networks also need to embrace blockchain technologies or cede further ground in the cross-border payments market.A combination of emerging use-cases, relative price-stability, and improvements such as Lightning Network implementation, are once more pushing Bitcoin\u2019s functionality as digital cash. Arrogance Comes Before A Bigger FallOne of the greatest threats to private payment systems could be their own arrogance. Perhaps secure in their belief that there is no viable alternative to their services, they continue to raise processing fees. Retailers, however, can only be pushed so far and there are signs of a backlash against high fees \u2014 particularly with Visa. The successful implementation of bitcoin payment solutions could easily upend the hegemony of Visa and Mastercard.Ellis\u2019 advice to clients on all three companies (Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal) is to buy, but for how much longer is another question completely.What do you think about Ellis\u2019 advice?

This week, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated the exchange would make efforts to avoid the token being classified as a security.Litecoin meanwhile had, at one point taken, the position of the third-largest altcoin from EOS \u2014 which subsequently reclaimed the title after 9.3 percent growth. The largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), is meanwhile up around 5.9 percent to trade at $135.What do you think about Bitcoin, Binance Coin, and Litecoin\u2019s price performance?

BNB, meanwhile, continues to attract attention beyond the question of security status. As Bitcoinist reported, Zhao himself described a report analyzing its value last month as \u201calmost scary\u201d in its thoroughness.Authored by Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital, the report concluded the token\u2019s value is underrated. BNB/USD currently trades around $11.50, with the pair\u2019s all-time high in January 2018 reaching just under $25.What do you think about Binance\u2019s position on profit-sharing?

It Started With A DissThe whole thing started when upcoming crypto-analyst @Sawcruhteez tweeted a pessimistic prediction. Unless bitcoin breaks a year-long declining trend-line by May, he suggested, we could see a drop similar to last November. He included a chart of how this may look, with bitcoin price down to under $1000.Lucid Investments\u2019 Leah Wald then jumped onboard, while plugging Lucid\u2019s Hyperwave theory, which @Sawcruhteez supposedly uses in his trading strategy. She signed off with a provocative challenge:How y\u2019all feeling bulls?I Never Thought It Would Come To ThisTurns out fil\u20bffil\u20bf was feeling just fine, thank you very much \u2014 certainly confident enough to oppose any bet that Bitcoin would trade under $1000. His proposed winning condition for the one-BTC bet was Bitcoin trading above $6000.I am feeling that i will happily take the other side of bets that BTC will not trade below $1k.Leah you're first 1 BTC\u2026 that Bitcoin trades above $6k before below $1k. https://t.co/tWZiPvedag\u2014 fil\u20bffil\u20bf (@filbfilb) March 4, 2019A slight tweak to the terms from Wald \u2014 setting lower and upper limits to $1500 and $6500 \u2014 and the bet was on.Um\u2026 Is That A Fair Bet?It may initially seem like a fil\u20bffil\u20bf victory sees him win a $6500-value bitcoin in a bull-market, whilst a loss means Wald is left catching a falling $1500-value knife\u2026\u2026which it continues to seem like, but Wald insists that she is long-term bullish \u2014 so the bitcoin price at completion is fairly irrelevant. After all, in the long term, 1 BTC = 1 BTC. If both sides have conviction in their belief, then it doesn\u2019t matter because they aren\u2019t going to lose.Interestingly, Wald\u2019s insistence of a shift to $1500-$6500 limits puts the current price of around $4000 directly in the middle. However, this ignores the logarithmic nature of the system. A drop from $4000 to $1500 represents a 62.5 percent move, whereas a move up to $6500 represents a 38.5 percent move.Anyway, for his part, fil\u20bffil\u20bf says $1300 was his absolute bottom prediction if everything went \u2018cray,\u2019 so he isn\u2019t as risk-free as he would have liked. But the stakes are certainly lower than many of the bets that have been put out there and, at least, there is no risk of him having to eat his own tickle-tackle on the telly.What do you think of our beloved fil\u20bffil\u20bf\u2019s bet?

A broader easing of currencies of emerging market countries in the face of the rising U.S. Treasury yields is a probable cause of TRY\u2019s performance. Turkish Lira Dragged Down by General EM SentimentThe Turkish Lira (TRY) lost around 1 percent against the US dollar on Friday. As reported by Reuters, the reasons for that might be numerous.First off, the currencies of Emerging Market (EM) countries have seen a weaker performance in the face of the stronger U.S. Treasury yields.Piotr Matys, emerging markets forex strategist at Rabobank, said:The sell-off to a degree can be attributed to worsening sentiment towards emerging markets, particularly towards high-yielding EM currencies.Additionally, U.S. officials have also made warnings that Turkey\u2019s purchase of certain Russian defense systems might potentially result in U.S. sanctions.Commenting on the matter, a forex trader at a Turkish bank noted:Regarding the selling pressure in the market, we also need to mention the concerns about relations with the United States. [\u2026] We are observing the possible negative impact of the choice between the Patriots with the U.S. and the S-400s on the relations between Turkey and the U.S.Is the Stage Set for a Takeoff?Despite the weaker performance of the USDTRY, experts believe that this might be setting the stage for an upcoming takeoff.Agreed. I have been building a position over the past week and just added last night. Watching the 4h chart closely. Bought the red 9 yesterday and will probably add more if the 50 & 200 EMA's make a golden cross. https://t.co/uO39UAADjf\u2014 Financial Survivalism (@Sawcruhteez) February 26, 2019As pointed out by traders on Twitter, with some brokers the margin requirements are particularly high on the USDTRY trading pair.This is where Evolve Markets comes into play with its great trading conditions on the Turkish Lira. Very reasonable and fair interest rates, as well as spreads, make them a good choice for capitalizing on the TRY. Because of the country\u2019s political and economic uncertainty, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see further volatility with the Turkish Lira going forward. And where there is volatility, there is also a potential for profits to be made.Margin trading does come with a lot of potential benefits, as a user is allowed to open a position which could be for a lot more money than he currently has on his account, hence eventually amplifying his profits. Of course, it\u2019s associated with greater risks as well.Evolve Markets provides traders with a leverage of 1:500 on Forex, indices, and commodities and 1:50 on cryptocurrencies.What do you think about margin trading the USDTRY in the current conditions?

Christina Comben | Mar 12, 2019 | 19:00 Share Tweet Send Share Inveniam is tokenizing real estate \u2014 but is the world really ready for this? Read enough cryptocurrency news sites and it won\u2019t be too long before you hear about tokenization of real-world assets. However, like most things blockchain, that remains purely hypothetical. It doesn\u2019t express itself in the form of an open real estate auction tokenizing Miami\u2019s WeWork building.Inveniam Capital Partners is looking to raise some $270 million for four different projects. These include the WeWork building and luxury apartment development on Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast. There\u2019s nothing unusual about that. What\u2019s really causing a stir, however, is that this is one of few times an auction like this is open to cryptocurrency investors. Oh, and that all proof of ownership will be manifested in tokens.There\u2019s no shortage of platforms springing up talking about democratizing access to wealth and allowing Average Joes to invest in previously off-limits projects like real estate \u2014 but most of them are still waiting for the regulatory nod within their jurisdictions. That doesn\u2019t appear to be the case for Inveniam. We\u2019re also not talking about \u2018Average Joes\u2019 either since the minimum you can invest is $500,000. Pat O\u2019Meara, who leads the New York company offering the investment enthused:This is brand new in capital markets transactions where the actual data is maintained electronically\u2026 The way people evidence that ownership is through that token in their wallet.It\u2019s \u2018Hard to Be First to Market\u2019There has been a handful of real estate deals conducted in this way \u2014 but none of them match the size and scope of this one. While the company is enthusiastic, several Florida attorneys remain a little cautious.Founding partner at Silver Miller and attorney David Silver said: It\u2019s hard to be the first to market, and this is one of the first and largest projects that is trying to tokenize real estate and infrastructure investments. Until I see regulators and institutions investing without problems, I am going to be slow to endorse the investment platform, and I continue to be hesitant in my recommendation\u2026 I am more cautious than not given what I do for a living, especially in the cryptocurrency space.Fellow attorney Jesse Fulton echoed his concerns stating that investors should be \u201cvery, very, very cognizant of what [they] are entering into.\u201dStill, Inveniam Could Be Sparking a TrendStill, there\u2019s always the real possibility that Inveniam is sparking a trend in the way that real estate ownership is handled. There\u2019s also the possibility that investors will be scammed out of their money and left with tokens in their wallets. However, this one\u2019s limited to institutional investors \u2014 or investors with extremely deep pockets). Silver added:I am happy to see that this is happening because I want sophisticated investors who understand how to do due diligence into projects like this to be the ones starting out the investment process.Inveniam already has several smaller cryptocurrency deals under its belt, but this is the first time they\u2019re looking for such large amounts or accepting such big sums of money in cryptocurrency. Cash is also an option.As they receive the bids, they will convert the tokens into cash using Grapefruit Trading, a company that provides liquidity for cryptocurrencies. They will then invest in the four projects. All investors\u2019 stakes will be tokenized with the proof of ownership in a digital wallet instead of a contract or deed. O\u2019Meara explained:This tokenized interest will be sent back to their wallet. That\u2019s an about a 15-minute process.He also expressed his hopes that this type of investing would open up such assets to people previously without access an \u201coff-the-beaten-path places.\u201d There\u2019s no barrier to entry with this type of investment \u2014 as long as you have an extra half a million dollars hanging around, of course.What do you think of tokenizing real estate?

All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsThe stock markets took a bit of a dip yesterday after a report that some of Trump\u2019s advisors are lobbying him not to strike a quick deal with China. Though Trump has reiterated that he could walk away from this deal as he did with Kim, it certainly seems like he wants a deal to happen.All in all, the impact on the stock market was nothing too dramatic. The day ended lower but there were plenty willing to buy the dip. The rally off the lows has not quite been called into question yet.However, there is a feeling that by the time Trump and Xi do sit down a comprehensive deal may already be priced into the markets. No pressure though.Stocks are seeing a nice recovery in Asia today despite the fact that China has lowered its growth forecast yet again, this time linking the slowdown directly to the above-mentioned trade war.Carney before the LordsBank of England Governor Mark Carney will take the stage today appearing before the House of Lords at approximately 3:35 PM GMT.This is the man who accurately predicted that the Pound Sterling would depreciate by 10% to 15% if the Brexit referendum carried. After taking heat for that prediction, Carney has since stated that he would see the country through the Brexit before quitting the BoE. So it pays to listen to what he has to say.Though I\u2019m sure many analysts will come into this speech with some sort of preconceived notions of what they want to hear or what to watch out for. My recommendation is to come into it with an open mind, listen and learn.In the spirit of that, the chart attached to this analysis is completely blank. Here is the GBPUSD since the referendum, devoid of any sort of indicators or support levels.Crypto Still RisingThe February rally may have stalled, but volumes on the blockchain and across exchanges remain elevated.For this reason, we can see Binance Coin bucking the market trend. The coin has quickly risen to the eighth largest cryptoasset by market cap.For a short period this morning, it even seemed like $BNB was bringing bitcoin up.The reason BNB is climbing is almost certainly related to the rising volumes on crypto exchanges that we highlighted above. It seems that cryptotraders are speculating that those volumes will continue to grow and that Binance will maintain a significant share of those volumes.However, it\u2019s important to remember that BNB is just a utility token and does not offer any share in Binance\u2019s profits.

Meanwhile, Jennifer Robertson, widow of founder Gerald Cotton, is requesting reimbursement of money spent on legal fees. Court Approves Appointment of Restructuring OfficerAccording to Bloomberg, Justice Michael Wood of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court on Tuesday (March 5, 2019) approved the appointment of Peter Wedlake as the chief restructuring officer of QuadrigaCX. The Court also extended the investor protection order granted to the company until April 23, 2019.Wedlake is a partner and senior vice president at Grant Thornton. At the back end of February 2019, Robertson, along with stepfather Tom Beazley, submitted an affidavit to the Court asking for Wedlake\u2019s appointment. According to Robertson, a lack of experience in matters relating to insolvency and the public scrutiny attached to the proceedings were the reason for the request.This new date means there will be a further 47-day stay of proceedings once the initial order expires on March 7, 2019. According to the third report issued by Ernst and Young, the court-appointed monitor on the case, representatives of the creditors had demanded that any further extension shouldn\u2019t go beyond 30 days.Widow of QuadrigaCX Founder Requests ReimbursementMeanwhile, Robertson is also asking for a reimbursement of money spent on legal fees during the proceedings to secure investor protection from the Court. Cotton\u2019s widow says she spent about $225,000 in interim financing from the late founder\u2019s estate.The Court adjourned hearing on the request to a later date. However, QuadrigaCX creditors have reportedly raised issues with Robertson\u2019s claim. According to the concerned creditors, the monitor is still in the process of reviewing the platform\u2019s assets.Challenging the reimbursement request, Gavin D.F.

Bitcoinist | Mar 12, 2019 | 21:00 Share Tweet Send Share As of April 3rd, the US\u2019s largest supermarket chain will stop accepting payments by Visa at 142 stores and 108 gas stations across seven states. With 2,800 locations across the States, Kroger has long been at odds with Visa and due to rising transaction costs, last July they shut the option at 21 locations in California. This latest update is a significant escalation.Some are hopeful that the supermarket giant might be keen to adopt bitcoin lightning as a cheap alternative to Visa cards. While that would be totally wumbo, I\u2019m not sure that the LN network is quite ready for that just yet as the infrastructure is still very much under construction.The question of mass adoption of cryptocurrencies is one that has been pondered by many industry advocates and certainly is not without its hurdles.Starbucks is planning to accept bitcoin through Bakkt by the end of the year. Birks Group in Canada has already started accepting bitcoin for Jewelry in some stores. Rakuten in Japan is also reportedly setting up an option for crypto payments that could go online soon.In stable economies, the question is more about convenience than necessity and so adoption will only take place once it\u2019s cheaper and easier for consumers. Kroger\u2019s latest move has highlighted the \u2018cheaper\u2019 part, the infrastructure for \u2018easier\u2019 is being built as we speak.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsNot Another Brexit VoteWhere did Bitcoin Transactions go?Alt Season ContinuesPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of March 12th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsWith 17 days left to the official Brexit deadline, things are getting tight. Today Parliament will vote on yet another version of May\u2019s deal with the EU. The deal has reportedly only been altered slightly since the last time Parliament voted it down in a historic defeat for the British Prime Minister.Should the vote fail again, Parliament is preparing another vote to close the possibility of a \u2018no deal Brexit\u2019 and take the option off the table. After that, we\u2019ll probably see some sort of attempt to delay the March 29th deadline.Judging by the Pound\u2019s surge over the last 24 hours (purple circle), it seems the market is pricing in a delay.Meanwhile across the pond, President Donald J Trump has proposed a new $4.75 trillion budget to Congress that is ruffling some feathers. The deadline to avoid another shutdown is months away though, currently set for October 1st. So, we can probably expect a lot more wrangling in the meantime.Stocks were doing pretty well in the Asian session but the rally seems to have come into question after the European opening.Missing Bitcoin VolumesIn yesterday\u2019s market update, we posted the following graph of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, which has seen a sharp decline since the start of the month.So, the obvious question that some of my readers have asked was, where did they go?One suggestion was that it could be due to massive power outages in Venezuela. According to data from coin.dance, volumes are down in the country by about 50% since their peak a month ago.Another reason could be that the startup known as Veriblock has ended their testnet. Veriblock was reportedly responsible for about a third of BTC transactions in the last few months.Due to the anonymous nature of bitcoin, it\u2019s very difficult to know for sure. Though if anyone has any other theories as to why it\u2019s happening, or confirmation of the two above, I\u2019d be glad to hear them.Though this specific data point may no longer be as relevant, my end conclusion from yesterday is unwavering.Welcome to alt season folks!Alt Season ContinuesBecause we\u2019re coming off a particularly harsh winter, we can\u2019t exactly expect conditions to warm up immediately and turn to summer without any transition phase.The term alt is short for altcoins, which basically means any cryptoasset that isn\u2019t bitcoin. Some of these tokens have seen staggering results over the last few weeks. Yesterday, two rather obscure coins saw triple-digit percentage returns within a 24 hours period.Trading on such cryptos can be extremely risky so if you are doing so, please do it with caution and due diligence.We noted the gains from XLM yesterday and it seems optimism is still high for Stellar Lumens. Many expect a groundbreaking announcement from Stellar and IBM at the 20/20 conference in Singapore next week.Yesterday afternoon, Cardano managed to raise some eyebrows by rising 7.4%, in 12 hours while the rest of the cryptos were largely flat.For long term investors, it\u2019s usually best to have a diversified portfolio and stick to your strategy. For short term traders, feel free to make a chart like this one that has all the cryptos on one graph to try and forecast which ones will outperform.You can also use something like coin360.com for this, which is now showing on several monitors here at eToro HQ.Happy alt season everyone!

We take a deeper dive into the action to see if can keep up the momentum. Daily ChartLooking at the daily chart, Bitcoin appears to have found support at the 50 and 100 daily moving average, with a single candle taking out the weekly opening at $3791. The Bulls will now look to establish support above this level in an attempt to gather their legs before another attempt at breaking $4000.The daily MAC-D is still trending above zero and is looking to cross bullish, while the stochastic RSI has already crossed bullish and implies that another leg higher may be in the works.The 200-day moving average is declining rapidly from $5000 and will likely act as resistance if Bitcoin can make a break to the upside. The last time it was tested as resistance was the key levels of $10,000 and $8,500, which resulted in continued downside for the flagship crypto asset, so it is certainly a level for the bulls to keep a close eye on.4 Hour ChartThe four-hour chart shows that Bitcoin has established a weekly low of $3672 \u2014 which is at the 61.8 percent retracement of the move which saw Bitcoin reject the $3300 range and retest $4000.The MAC-D has crossed zero but implies that the bulls are running out of momentum, which is also displayed in the Stochastic RSI.It seems likely that there will need to be a retest of the weekly opening at $3790, which if support can be found, the next lower time frame objective for the bulls will be to take out last week\u2019s highs of $3900.30 Minute ChartLooking closer at the 30-minute chart, a 1.618 Fibonacci extension of the move on Tuesday provides the bulls with a $4,000 target \u2014 which is a logical place to see some profit taking before any attempt to knock at the door of the $4100-$4200 range, which has provided sterling support for the bears.As we found at $6000, the more times that the bears knocked at the door, the weaker the door became. It is quite possible that this will ultimately be the case for $4,000, while there is now a multi-month rising support level at the 200-week moving average.Weekly ChartTaking a quick peek at the weekly chart, we can see that Bitcoin is right at the diagonal resistance level which it has faced for 12 months and is supported by a bullish cross on the MAC-D \u2014 despite still being below zero.All of the signs are that Bitcoin does want to try to move higher towards the 200 DMA and ultimately break the $4,000 range; however, it is important to note that Bitcoin is still within a brutal bear market and even highs above $5000 would not suffice to indicate a macro shift in the momentum of the market. The declining weekly resistance could still prove too much for the bulls.Trade Bitcoin, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

Brody, the Global Blockchain Innovation Chief at Ernst and Young (EY), says he sees no practical application for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This statement comes amid a growing rate of adoption of virtual currencies in both developed and developing nations. Tokenized Fiat (Not Bitcoin) is The Future of MoneySpeaking to Forbes India, Brody opined that he hardly sees any practical application for Bitcoin (BTC) or any of the other over 2,000 cryptocurrencies currently in existence. According to the EY executive, crypto-fiat and not Bitcoin is the future of money.Commenting on the matter, Brody declared:Most people and companies earn their revenue and spend their money in local currency; we believe the future of business transactions on the blockchain are tokenized fiat currencies-basically blockchain-linked dollars, euros, yen, rupees and so on. Transacting on a day-to-day business in a foreign currency just adds foreign exchange risk to all your transactions.For Brody, Bitcoin\u2019s deflationary currency model makes it a poor form of money for widespread global adoption. Instead, Brody maintains that the modern-day fiat model is still the best bet, claiming that hyperinflation is at best a minute probability.Global BTC acceptance is up by more than 700 percent in the last six years. More than 140,000 retail avenues across the world now accept Bitcoin as a means of payment.The top-ranked cryptocurrency continues to see increased usage \u2014 from remittance payments in Africa and Southeast Asia to public transportation in Argentina.As a store of value and an investment asset, BTC continues to outshine mainstream markets despite going through multiple high percentage price plummets. Bitcoin (BTC) has outperformed the S&P, DOW, and NASDAQ over the last ten years.Saying cryptos, in general, have no practical use would be akin to calling the attention generated by the industry as little more than a fad. Such a characterization seems at odds with the increasing level of institutional adoption of cryptocurrency-based investments. Public pension funds, stock market operators, and other multi-billion-dollar corporations are investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. That hardly seems like an asset class with \u201cno practical use.\u201dBlockchain is BoringWhile declaring Bitcoin\u2019s supposed lack of real-world utility, Brody believes that Blockchain, despite being the \u201cmost boring revolution in technology,\u201d has the potential to affect many aspects of the global business process. However, the EY exec says that blockchain isn\u2019t a one-stop shop solution for every type of business. Elaborating further, Brody declared:One must carefully choose the kinds of business applications to run on the blockchain. Even though blockchains are getting faster, they are never going to be cheaper or faster than existing banking payment systems or stock exchange platforms.Speaking during the interview, Brody predicted that blockchain would eventually become like the Internet but with a visible lack of centralization. In the end, Brody believes that the different approaches in the industry will condense into a uniform set of principles that would drive the technology moving forward.What are the other practical Bitcoin cases that you know?

Now, other well-known cryptocurrency exchanges are also jumping on the same bandwagon with propositions of their own. The New ICO HypetrainEarlier in 2019, Binance \u2014 which is currently the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange by traded volumes \u2014 announced that it will feature one token sale every month. This takes place on its exclusive platform, conveniently dubbed Binance Launchpad.So far in 2019, there have been two major fundraising rounds carried out, both of which turned out massively successful. The first one was the sale of BitTorrent Token (BTT), which saw upwards of $7 million worth of tokens sold in less than 15 minutes. The second one was a project called Fetch.AI. It sold FET tokens worth $6 million almost as quickly.Both cryptocurrencies surged in price immediately after they started trading on Binance \u2014 something particularly customary to cryptocurrencies issued through ICOs back in 2018.Binance has already announced its next token sale, set to take place on March 19. The project is called Celer Network.All AboardAs this new initiative is seemingly gaining momentum, other industry participants have also jumped on the bandwagon.Michael Gan, CEO at the popular cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin, has revealed that they are working on a new platform called Spotlight \u2014 which is set to launch soon. While there\u2019s not a lot of available information at the time of this writing, his tweet hints that the platform will carry out activity similar to that of Binance Launchpad.A new program of us, we name it Spotlight, is coming soon, and we believe it will be a launch platform for hidden gems in blockchain that have real potential and value. pic.twitter.com/SuQRN3WQRu\u2014 Michael Gan (@gan_chun) March 11, 2019Moreover, at just about the same time, another major cryptocurrency exchange, Bittrex, has revealed that it will host its very first \u201cInitial Exchange Offering\u201d (IEO). Despite the different wording, the purpose of the IEO is almost identical to that of traditional ICOs \u2014 to raise funds for the development of products and technology.The first project to have its IEO is called RAID and it will sell XRD tokens on March 15 to authorized Bittrex users only. Investors can purchase XRD tokens with Bitcoin (BTC).Speaking on the matter, Bill Shihara, CEO at Bittrex International, said that they look forward to having other fundraising events of the kind in the future:We are excited for this IEO and look forward to helping similarly innovative teams connect with users to build their platforms for the future.What do you think of this new cryptocurrency exchange-backed model of fundraising?

Hollywood Really Has a Finger on The Pulse of Bitcoin Emilio Janus | Mar 13, 2019 | 02:00 Share Tweet Send Share The trailer for Crypto (the movie) hit YouTube yesterday, featuring all the essential elements of a standard Hollywood thriller \u2014 which would be fine if they hadn\u2019t called the movie \u201cCrypto.\u201d Movies rely on the suspension of disbelief, but Wall Street and the Russian Mafia? Really? Turn OnAs reported by Bitcoinist last June, the film features Kurt Russell, an ex-Gilmore Girl, the least famous Hemsworth brother, and someone called Beau (not Bridges). Beau is that rarest of things, an honest man on Wall Street \u2014 which annoys his employer, so they reassign him to the arse-end of nowhere, which coincidentally is the town he grew up in.In his role as an \u201cAML officer\u2026 Anti Money Laundering,\u201d he discovers that his company is in bed with the Russian Mafia. Quite why they\u2019ve sent this particular goody-goody to the exact place where they\u2019re covering up such a scam is anyone\u2019s guess.Even more confusing is why details of bribes reside in a folder named \u2018Kickbacks\u2019 but \u2014 meh. Hollywood.Cash InAs everyone knows, most Wall Street hotshots are well into their crypto; most crypto is used for money-laundering; crypto just wouldn\u2019t be crypto without the Russian Mafia.Just look at all the hot references in this screenshot:But it all feels a little bit tacked-on \u2014 shoed-in if you will \u2014 like a blatant jump onto an unnecessary bandwagon. Indeed, a bit of digging reveals the script was based on an original story called \u2018The Examiner\u2019 by Jeff Ingber. Ingber has three decades of experience in the financial industry, but he doesn\u2019t profess to know anything about cryptocurrencies.After an idealistic examiner returns to his boyhood town to inspect its venerable bank, he falls for a woman from his past, confronts painful memories, and uncovers a web of illegal activity and money laundering while unable to trust anyone, including his scheming boss.So it seems like someone took his original money-laundering story and \u2018sexed it up\u2019 by adding some crypto \u2014 again, this would be fine if they hadn\u2019t called the whole damn movie \u2018Crypto\u2019.Cop OutIt\u2019s hard to know who this movie is supposed to appeal to. Crypto fans are unlikely to be satisfied with Bitcoin\u2019s first starring role on the big screen. From the trailer, it hardly seems like a good source of crypto-knowledge for the uninitiated. It will be interesting to see how well this movie does on release, which is at selected theatres and streaming platforms from April 12.Perhaps it will surprise us by being really good and will do its bit to bring cryptocurrency to the masses. They do say that there\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity. It just feels like this is a bit of a cash in on 2017\u2019s Bitcoin-mania. (Sadly, that\u2019s about the speed that Hollywood works.) It would be nicer if something produced by a crypto-enthusiast got this sort of budget and attention.What do you think of \u201cCrypto?\u201d Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

In March, however, this figure has so far dipped to just over 0.2 percent. \u201cThe entire industry is ripe to resume a path to lower prices,\u201d Bloomberg quotes McGlone as saying in a recent report. Should the trend continue, he concluded, Bitcoin markets could see a repeat of behavior from late 2018. In mid-November, when altcoin Bitcoin Cash underwent a contentious hard fork, the Bitcoin price fell considerably \u2014 losing almost half its then $6500 value. \u201cConditions are akin to November, just prior to the collapse,\u201d said McGlone. \u201cPrices are consolidating within narrowing ranges, with a few sharp bear-market rallies that appear fleeting.\u201dBottom Not In?More price suppression would further test investor resolve, especially in the wake of an impressive return to form for Bitcoin\u2019s technical indicators.

SEC Presents Concerted View On EthereumAfter receiving a response to an enquiry from Jay Clayton, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), New York-based nonprofit Coin Center reignited a festering debate about cryptocurrency and securities obligations. Coin Center had asked Clayton for clarification in September 2018, three months after the SEC\u2019s Director of Corporate Finance, William Hinman, issued comments suggesting he did not think ether was a security. Hilman based his stance on the Howey Test, a method for determining securities compliance, and confirmed private research suggested Ether would fail this test.

The move follows Samsung\u2019s support for Enjin, a popular e-gaming platform. Ripple\u2019s Xpring and Forte Spending Big TimeAccording to a press release published March 12, Ripple\u2019s developer ecosystem initiative, Xpring, and blockchain tech provider Forte have teamed up on a $100 million fund to support game developers. Per the release, the fund is designated to accelerate the mainstream adoption of blockchain-based technology in gaming. Moreover, Forte is supposedly targeting game developers which are running live-game economies harboring over 50,000 daily active users, as well as interest in blockchain deployment. Speaking on the matter of the vast gaming industry and how blockchain technology can be deployed within it, Brett Seyler, Chief Platform Officer at Forte, said:Blockchain technologies\u2019 key innovations unlock vast potential for nearly all forms of digital interaction. Gaming is a $140 billion global industry driven predominantly by digital micro-transaction economies, which we believe will benefit immensely from the integrity and resilience of blockchain technology. The industry needs solutions that can support these economies at scale with cross-chain interoperability.Gaming Getting Lots of Recent AttentionIt appears that the gaming industry is getting serious attention, especially recently. The partnership between Ripple\u2019s Xpring and Forte comes soon after tech giant Samsung released its new flagship smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy S10. One of the most interesting developments on the matter is the fact that the device will have a hardware-backed secure storage solution for cryptocurrencies and it will support decentralized applications (DApps). As Bitcoinist reported, one of the projects which have been confirmed as supported on the new S10 is Enjin Coin. The cryptocurrency is created by a Singaporean company called Enjin. It\u2019s creating an ecosystem for gaming and it reportedly boasts 20 million users spread through 250,000 gaming communities.

It ended in less than 15 minutes, selling $7.2 million in BTT tokens at $0.00012 a pop. At the time of this writing, BTT trades at $0.00075 \u2014 a six-fold increase on any investments made in the digital token during the time of its sale.It\u2019s also worth noting that, according to the token allocation plan of BitTorrent, 20 percent of the total supply is held by the TRON Foundation, 19.9 percent by the BitTorrent Ecosystem, and 19 percent by the \u201cteam.\u201d The total supply of BTT is 990,000,000,000. In other words, approximately 594,000,000,000 tokens are held by entities owned by Justin Sun. At current prices, that\u2019s roughly around $445,500,000.What do you think of Justin Sun\u2019s $20M cash airdrop and Tesla giveaway? Don\u2019t hesitate to let us know in the comments below!

This unique event happens on twitter when the number of replies to a post far outweighs the number of likes, indicating that people are generally dissatisfied with the content portrayed.For example, an old tweet from the American actor Felicity Huffman, the star of \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019, was dug up yesterday to publicly shame her for the recent involvement in an education-related scandal where rich parents were allegedly bribing top colleges to secure enrollment for their children. In the tweet resurrected by Twitter users from August 2016, Felicity was asking her followers for the best \u201chacks\u201d to prepare for the school season.Another tweet that got royally ratioed last night came from the European Central Bank, which was promoting the hashtag #AskECB. They got a little more engagement then they were probably expecting with this tweet\u2026As you can probably imagine, the responses were filled with people wondering how they, as private citizens, could also \u201ccreate money to buy assets\u201d and of course an abundance of memes from the bitcoin community.@MatiGreenspaneToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsStocks are still in a bear marketTheresa May Lost her VoiceFake Trades in Crypto?Please note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of March 13th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsPopular investor Jeffrey Gundlach made a bunch of headlines after his webcast yesterday by saying that \u201cthe stock market was and still is in a bear market.\u201dThis is a bit odd given the markets recent recovery since the start of the year and it\u2019s proximity to the all-time highs.Now, the definition of a \u2018bear market\u2019 is one that is often debated by economists, so Jefferey clarified by saying that he believes the stock market will go negative in 2019.It will come as no surprise to those of you who read these updates regularly, Gundlach is attributing the recent recovery entirely to the Federal Reserve.He also pushed back against protagonists of MMT calling it a \u201ccrackpot idea.\u201dMay lost her voiceYesterday, the UK Parliament once again strongly rejected Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, seemingly removing it from the table for good. Addressing Parliament yesterday, a hoarse Prime Minister outlined the possible next steps as we approach March 29th.Today, UK lawmakers will weigh in on whether or not they think it should be permissible for Great Britain to leave the European Union without a trade deal, what has been dubbed the \u2018no-deal Brexit\u2019 option and has been portrayed by some economists and politicians as a doomsday scenario.The Pound Sterling remains extremely volatile but hopefully today we\u2019ll get some more clarity about how this is going to play out.It\u2019s a WashA recent report from aptly named Crypto Integrity has made the claim that a very high percentage of volumes reported at crypto exchanges is actually inflated. Meaning, that the daily volume figure we\u2019ve been tracking lately that currently stands at approximately $30 billion, actually might not be as big as all that.The good folks from Block TV decided to spring this question on me yesterday on a live interview. Certainly, it\u2019s difficult to make any sort of judgment call without reviewing the report in question. Still, I stand by what I said there that this research does need to be taken with a pinch of salt.In the very first paragraph of the report, it states that they only investigated specific symbols and exchanges that seemed suspicious to their team so it\u2019s not surprising that they found a high level of confirmation. Of course, that didn\u2019t stop several crypto sites from running with the headline.Clearly, they didn\u2019t realize that the 86% figure was just a ratio and not reflective of the entire market.Wash trading is generally seen as bad practice and is now illegal in many stock exchanges and was specifically implicated in the infamous Libor scandal. Yes, there is probably some level of this happening in the crypto market but headlines that blow things out of proportion like this should probably be classified as FUD.Alt Season ContinuesAn article out on Bloomberg has pointed out that\u2026Meaning, that the rally we saw since the mid-December lows has slowed down. Very glad that they had an expert analyst to point out that the momentum hasn\u2019t disappeared entirely but rather it\u2019s shifted gears. As we\u2019ve been discussing, the crypto market is now officially in alt season and there\u2019s no telling how long it will last.Yesterday\u2019s winner was Dash, which climbed 16.8% in a 30 hour window, while much of the rest of the crypto market was flat.Which coin will outperform today?

TRON\u2019s CEO also implied that critics of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were focused on the business side of things rather than the more profound technological implications virtual currencies provide within the emerging digital economy. A Promising Future for Bitcoin and CryptocurrenciesSpeaking to CNBC on Wednesday (March 13, 2019), Sun weighed in on the future of Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies in general. Commenting on the matter, Sun said he was optimistic about the future of virtual currencies.According to the TRON\u2019s CEO, developments of layer-two protocols like the Lightning Network, as well as the recent involvement of institutions like JPMorgan and Facebook in the industry, is indicative of the growing utility of virtual assets.Christopher Giancarlo, the head of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also echoed sentiments similar to Sun\u2019s. In a speech delivered on Thursday (March 14, 2019), the CFTC chair described cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as massive drivers in the transformation of the modern-day investment market.When pressed about criticisms from the likes of Warren Buffett about Bitcoin\u2019s utility, Sun declared that cryptocurrencies are more of a technology than a business opportunity. Elaborating further, Sun opined that virtual currencies present great opportunities for the younger generation while declaring that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are \u201cthe next wave of the Internet.\u201dFocus Should be on Mass Adoption (Not Market Capitalization)The TRON CEO also presented a case for a greater focus on mass adoption, rather than on metrics like market capitalization. TRON is the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market cap \u2014 currently standing at $1.5 billion. Rather than focusing on market cap value, Sun instead says his focus is on the business development and technological aspects.In the mid-2018, TRON acquired BitTorrent, the file-sharing platform. Sun highlighted that his company is taking steps to integrate cryptocurrency and blockchain technology into the BitTorrent network. By so doing, Sun believes that they can onboard the platform\u2019s over 100 million active users across 138 countries onto a vibrant decentralized platform for file sharing.Apart from the ongoing efforts with BitTorrent, the TRON CEO also thinks that projects like Facebook\u2019s proposed cryptocurrency will guarantee greater adoption of virtual assets on a global scale.Do you agree with Sun\u2019s summation that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have a promising future?

The charts are relatively neutral but pressure is certainly building in the Bitcoin (BTC) market. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the action.1-Day ChartThe one-day chart for Bitcoin (BTC) shows that, since the decline following the three-wave run up to $4200 during February, Bitcoin has been range bound \u2014 swinging around four percent either side of the March opening and establishing a monthly range between $3670 and $3950.Overall, the chart remains is in a bottoming pattern; with the current price action attempting to put in a third higher low \u2014 but the bulls are struggling to break across $3950 and conquer the $4000 handle.The MACD is relatively flat but has crossed marginally bearish \u2014 although, still above zero \u2014 so this does not particularly lend itself to being indicative of a direction.The DMA 50 and 100 are crossed bullish and lie right on the monthly support and 61.8 percent retracement of the February move at $3670.Should these fail to hold as support when interrogated by the bears, the 200 WMA lies some way below at $3400 and would act as the last line of defense for the bulls.4-Hour ChartThe four-hour chart shows that Bitcoin (BTC) price action remains at the upper end of the monthly range and previous tests of the lows have been bought up quickly by the bulls.However, the charts are leaning slightly bearish on lower timeframes, with a cross on the StochRSI crossed bearishly and a Head and Shoulders top threatening to form \u2014 which would indicate that a retest of the monthly range lows at $3670 would be on the cards. Should it fail on the third time of asking, it would imply a fast move to the lower $3500s would be possible.Weekly ChartLooking at the bigger picture, we can see that Bitcoin is being capped by the 20-week moving average and supported by the 200-week moving average. This implies that whichever boundary proves to subside will be indicative of what the direction of travel may be for the next few months \u2014 and it was key when Bitcoin bottomed during 2015, although there is no guarantee that the same will occur during 2019.Finally, looking at the structure of the market and in comparison to prior years where Bitcoin had indeed attempted to find a definitive close to the bear market, we can see why traders and speculators alike are at odds as to what will occur next.The market posture is that of a market bottom, but as we have seen in the past, it can take multiple attempts before a bottom can be found. If the bulls win the battle, $5,000 will be the target. Should the bears take control, mid $2000s would be in sight for the bears.Only time will tell what will happen next, but pressure is building and it implies we will get a definitive move by the end of March.Trade Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

Most recently, the Mt. Gox creditors asked him to help prepare a plan to maximize returns and repair the damage caused by its infamous scandal \u2014 so his predictions in Forbes for the next year are certainly worth listening to. The Rise of dAppsDecentralized applications have been around for a while now on platforms such as Ethereum (ETH), TRON (TRX), Cardano (ADA), and the Pierce-developed EOS. So far, though, they are struggling to find regular users outside of the gambling and gaming categories.Pierce believes that 2019 will see multiple dApps hitting a million users. He says that the best projects in the crypto ecosystem happen when prices are down. In bull markets, people are too busy getting rich to build things.He thinks that three criteria must be met to spur mass adoption:They have to be scalable. They have to be fee-less and frictionless. They have to be fast. No one will use the new internet if it\u2019s slow, costs money and doesn\u2019t\u2019 scale. We are building the new internet, so new standards need to be set.Security Token OfferingsPierce suggests that security token offerings (STOs) will create a \u201cquadrillion dollar market,\u201d with the tokenization of all manner of real-world assets. He sees them as the next wave in the evolution of capital markets but doesn\u2019t think initial coin offerings (ICOs) are fundamentally bad.\u2026utility tokens are by nature not intended to be security, so [ICOs] provided little protection. STOs have a framework that can do that. STOs are designed for investors and can have many provisions that are there to protect market participants.Online GamingWith a CV that includes the pioneering of selling in-game items for real currency, you could expect Pierce to see potential in this sector.He says that the people who originally bought and sold in-game currency and items online became some of the earliest adopters of cryptocurrency:It\u2019s that community of users around the world that have driven the first wave of crypto adoption and so I think there\u2019s a very good chance that gaming in all its forms will be one of the major drivers of the success of the ecosystem.Some FriendlyThe final pieces of the puzzle, according to Pierce, are user-friendliness and embracing features like money messaging \u2014 especially for the unbanked. He likens the current state to that of the internet before browsers with intuitive user-interfaces started to appear and make it accessible:The same thing needs to happen now. With crypto payments We\u2019ve had wonderful technologists now we need great user interfaces.What do you think of Brock Pierce\u2019s predictions? Let us know what you think in the comments below!

Does this mean the bear market is on its way out? Marc Faber may not be revered for his views on racial equality. But when it comes to investing, he\u2019s up there with Warren Buffet \u2014 as far as successful track records go. Unlike the other aging investor who dismisses Bitcoin as a \u2018rat poison squared,\u2019 Faber finally bought his first chunk of the world\u2019s number one cryptocurrency.Marc Faber Famously Skeptical of BitcoinBitcoin has always piqued the interest of the savvy investor \u2014 who is famous for buying depressed assets \u2014 due to the parallels drawn between gold and commodities. Dubbed by the press as \u201cDr. Doom,\u201d Faber is typically pessimistic over the outlook for financial markets and a staunch critic of central banks \u2014 whose monetary policies, he believes, lead to the financial recession.Interest or no, he has remained skeptical and refused to invest in Bitcoin. However, last week, Faber admitted in an interview with Germany\u2019s Cash that he finally has some skin in the game:I bought Bitcoin for the first time ten days ago.Faber didn\u2019t make his decision overnight. (An investor of this magnitude rarely does.) As the publisher of the Gloom Boom & Doom Report newsletter, his younger audience has repeatedly urged him to buy Bitcoin over the years. However, it could have been his lengthy discussion with Xapo CEO and Paypal executive director Wence Casares that tipped the scales. Faber also told Cash that the price of BTC \u201clooks better\u201d now that it has plunged from its lofty heights of roughly $20,000 in 2017. Moreover, bitcoin has actually made gains of around 15 percent in the last three months.Does This Mean The Bitcoin Bear Market is Almost Over?Now that funds from Wall Street and big investors famous for buying assets at their lowest price are starting to enter the space, does this mean the bear market end could be in sight? If it is, Faber isn\u2019t making any calls:It\u2019s not certain, but possible, that Bitcoin will be the standard for money transfers.He still maintains a healthy dose skepticism for the cryptocurrency, the likes any 73-year old may be expected to have. As a new and volatile asset class, he was quick to warn viewers that they should never invest more than they can afford to lose \u2014 which is always sound advice.

But what does this mean for the state, the country, and the industry as a whole? The Emphasis in Wyoming is on InnovationIn an article for Forbes yesterday, Caitlin Long, blockchain advocate and Wall Street veteran, laid out her vision of what the acts actually mean. It includes:Special Purpose Depository InstitutionsCommercial Filing SystemCorporate Stock Certificate TokensDigital Assets \u2013 Existing LawThe details of each act and how companies and individuals can take advantage of them can be found here, but some of the highlights include applying the same rules to virtual currencies as to money and the creation of a fintech sandbox that allows companies to grow without the burden of regulation for up to three years. Blockchain companies struggling to get a bank account will be able to access most financial services. This is with the notable exception of loans through the creation of a bank for blockchain companies. The state has also authorized a custodian for large institutions that will recognize direct ownership of digital assets.This is key since Wyoming\u2019s digital asset custodians won\u2019t act like traditional securities custodians. Investors own their digital assets under a custody bailment, for example, so they are simply giving up control over their digital assets by using a custodian service here \u2014 not ownership. Long states:In sum, Wyoming will become known as the home of SOLVENT, investor-friendly digital asset custodians to which investment fiduciaries are likely to migrate over time. The 13 laws together will allow companies to actually progress without being strangled by regulation. They are long-term measures to support the growth of blockchain technology and attract capital, revenue, and jobs to Wyoming.Special ep of This Week in Bitcoin:Wyoming has taken the lead as the most crypto friendly state in USA!!@CaitlinLong_ breaks down the recently passed bills and what can be expected for banking, utility tokens, custody, mining, and more.Listen now: https://t.co/COzmqtMb5E pic.twitter.com/KGuVMsgPxR\u2014 \ud835\udd44\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd65 \ud835\udd38\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd63\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd5f (@mattaaron) March 5, 2019The Other States are Following Wyoming\u2019s LeadAccording to Long, Wyoming is now, by far, the most advanced jurisdiction in the country. Other states will most likely follow its lead. (Some already are, including Colorado and Montana.) However, they will be unable to compete:No other state is likely to catch up to Wyoming \u2014 it\u2019s a very tall order for any legislature to enact 13 bills on a single topic in a compressed time frame, especially when another state has already claimed first-mover advantage.Bitcoinist spoke to Andrew Hinkes, General Counsel of Athena Blockchain and Adjunct Professor at NYU Stern School of Business and NYU School of Law. Well-versed in the subject, Hinkes regularly follows the progress that each state is making. He also names and shames those falling behind, as well as recognizing achievements and progress:#Arizona, come on down!

Here\u2019s what Hinkes had to say about Wyoming: Wyoming has jumped ahead of every other jurisdiction in the U.S., and perhaps the world, to welcome digital assets. Its sweeping legislation provides an unprecedented level of legal certainty to owners of crypto assets. This positions Wyoming as a very attractive place to incorporate or operate a crypto-related business. However, it\u2019s all well and good to develop laws at a state level, but that doesn\u2019t mean that federal rules don\u2019t apply in certain cases. Hinkes points out:The reach of these new laws, however, are limited by the U.S. federal system of government which imposes different laws on interstate conduct, including sales of securities. So while Wyoming has taken an impressive lead in open-minded regulation of the crypto space, these laws are limited by federal laws that for the most part have not taken the same positions.Could Wyoming Become the Federal Example?With the countless heads of draconian policymakers at the helm, this is something that remains distinctly to be seen.

Lessons Learned?Earlier in February, Coinbase, the leading US-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced the acquisition of blockchain surveillance startup Neutrino.The move caused a massive outburst of the cryptocurrency community because Neutrino\u2019s CEO, Giancarlo Russo, previously worked as a COO of Hacking Team, an Italian-based venue with a questionable (to say the least) reputation. The Hacking Team has reportedly sold commercial hacking software to the police, enabling them to carry out a huge number of surveillance activities.Soon after that, Coinbase\u2019s Director of Institutional Sales, Christine Sandler, admitted that the members of the cryptocurrency exchange sold client data to an \u2018outside source\u2019 \u2014 adding even more fuel to the fire.In an attempt to rectify the situation, CEO Brian Armstrong explained his stance on the matter in an official blog post.The executive said that those members of Neutrino who used to work at Hacking Team will be transitioned out of Coinbase. Apparently, the leading US-based cryptocurrency exchange failed to \u201cproperly evaluate everything\u201d from the perspective of their mission as a \u201ccrypto company.\u201dYet, ambiguity continues to stem from the post \u2014 as there is absolutely no mention of which team members will be \u201ctransitioned out\u201d of Coinbase or what that means, exactly.Industry-Wide ResonanceFollowing Coinbase\u2019s scandal, New York-based blockchain analytics company Chainalysis published an official statement which outlines that the firm doesn\u2019t collect or sell personal data from its users when it provides services to cryptocurrency exchanges. The report reads:\u2026we do not collect any personally identifiable information from exchanges. Chainalysis only knows that a particular address belongs to a customer at that exchange, not who the customer is.While not explicitly stated, Chainalysis\u2019 statement does look a lot like a direct response to Coinbase\u2019s Sandler, who said that their third-party service providers were selling client data to \u2018outside sources.\u2019What do you think of the whole Coinbase-Neutrino fiasco?

He continues to defend BH investment Wells Fargo bank, despite almost $15 billion in penalty fines since 2000. You Make One Mistake\u2026Wells Fargo got caught doing bad things. Lots and lots of very bad things. To meet quotas set by management, employees opened fake accounts, ordered unauthorized credit-cards, and forged client signatures \u2014 and this wasn\u2019t just a few rogue staff members. Thousands of employees opened 3.5 million unnecessary accounts over a decade and a half. Management later admitted retaliation against employees who threatened to expose the scandal.While the fallout from this was still ongoing, Wells Fargo admitted charging over half a million customers for auto-insurance they didn\u2019t need. This led to around 20,000 customers defaulting on car loans and the illegal repossession of some vehicles.Not content with this, the bank also modified mortgages without authorization and fined 110,000 mortgage holders for missed deadlines \u2014 despite the fact that the delays were the company\u2019s fault. They also overcharged small businesses for processing credit card transaction, but you could probably already have guessed that.Buffett\u2019s response in a CNBC interview?They made one mistake.The Only One I KnowThis was the same week he famously described Bitcoin as \u201crat poison squared,\u201d but he was happy to defend the poisonous actions of Wells Fargo.Incentives work. And they came up with improper incentives and they worked. And so, they [incentivized] bad behavior instead of [incentivizing] good behavior.

So it comes as no surprise that a company called BlockFi just announced they\u2019re willing to pay a hefty interest for deposits in crypto. Some crypto thought leaders have already expressed skepticism, including the blockchain lawyer Jake Chervinsky, who seems to be wondering where the money will come from.Don\u2019t get me wrong, 6.2% is a pretty good rate for fixed income. However, at this point, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth the risk.

However, the extent that these companies will actually utilize the Ripple token is still in question.

A Bitcoin Bank AccountEven the greatest proponents of Bitcoin tend to admit that the number one cryptocurrency is unlikely to replace banks anytime soon. However, it certainly has fiat currency in its sights. With the launch of two high-interest Gemini-backed cryptocurrency accounts in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), maybe the banks should be worried after all.BlockFi offering 6.2% on both BTC and ETH deposits changes the game.

A thread:\u2014 Ryan Todd (@_RJTodd) March 5, 2019For those investors who don\u2019t mind a bear market and who want to HODL their chosen cryptocurrency, a 6.2 percent interest rate may be appealing. Perhaps it\u2019s too early for the estimated 92 percent of Americans who don\u2019t own cryptocurrency, though. Since the cryptocurrency market lost around $400 billion from its market cap in one year, high-interest rates on a dwindling investment may fail to appeal.However, the Bitcoin and Ethereum interest accounts were launched yesterday via BlockFi crypto lending platform. In its private beta in January, the company attracted more than $10 million in deposits from institutional and retail investors alike \u2014 showing a clear demand for its services. BlockFi also raised a massive $58 million in several rounds of funding, offering loans starting from $2,000 against BTC, ETH, or Litecoin (LTC) with a 4.5 percent interest rate. The company also has plans to launch a cryptocurrency-backed credit card. However, it\u2019s the 6.2 percent interest on the Bitcoin and Ethereum accounts that will really capture attention.

OneCoin To Rule Them AllRuja Ignatova created OneCoin in Bulgaria in 2014 and it generated $3.8 billion in revenue by Q3 2016, according to prosecutors. The OneCoin \u2018tokens\u2019 rose in alleged value from 50 euro cents to nearly \u20ac30 \u2014 despite the fact that the \u2018digital currency\u2019 had no blockchain, no utility, and no way of monitoring it.In classic Ponzi style, it relied on a constant flow of money from new investors \u2014 which existing members received commissions for recruiting. The cryptocurrency media quickly called out OneCoin as an MLM pyramid scheme, and authorities followed suit in an increasing number of countries.However, the project soldiered on, even going so far as to announce an initial public offering (IPO) in early 2017. Before this could happen, Ruja Ignatova disappeared from the public eye, with her brother, Konstantin, taking the reins in 2018.Sweet Dreams, My LA ExKonstantin Ignatov\u2019s arrest at the Los Angeles International Airport was on charges of conspiring to commit wire fraud.

They promised big returns and minimal risk, but, as alleged, this business was a pyramid scheme based on smoke and mirrors more than zeroes and ones.New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance added that: \u201cThese defendants executed an old-school pyramid scheme on a new-school platform.\u201dScamming Until The Very EndPrior to his arrest, Ignatov had traveled to the United States to meet OneCoin affiliates.

His reported response was:If you are here to cash out, leave this room now, because you don\u2019t understand what this project is about.That was possibly the most brutally honest advice OneCoin investors ever received.If found guilty, Ignatov\u2019s charge carries a maximum sentence of twenty years in prison.

Hard Fork Aims to Improve Monero\u2019s Key FeaturesMonero (XMR) strives to differentiate itself from other cryptocurrencies by focusing on privacy and security. With the aim of enhancing these features, the Monero team has completed a network upgrade \u2014 involving about a million updates.The scheduled protocol upgrade went successfully! \ud83c\udf89\u2014 Monero || #xmr (@monero) March 9, 2019Specifically, Monero underwent a hard fork at block 1788000 to improve its privacy, security, and ASIC resistance by introducing four key changes to the network. Monero specified these changes as follows:First, some changes to the dynamic block size algorithm to fix the big bang attack.Second, a third PoW tweak (CryptoNight-R) to curb the ASICs currently present on the network and further preserve ASIC resistance. As a result, miners will have to update their miners (i.e., mining software) as well.Third, a dummy encrypted payment ID is now added to each transaction to improve transaction homogeneity.Fourth, the development team simplified amount commitments by shrinking the size of amount encodings and using deterministic masks. These changes were deemed safe to apply by the Monero ResearchLab. Additionally, the changes essentially entail the transaction format being upgraded to a v2 format.\u201dUpon completion of the hard fork, Monero informed its users that, for the next 24-48 hours, they should expect slower block times.Monero Focus Protecting on User PrivacyMonero\u2019s elaborate built-in privacy protections make it ideal for users wishing to perform payments anonymously. Moreover, Monero claims that its transactions are untraceable. According to Monero website:Sending and receiving addresses as well as transacted amounts are obfuscated by default. Transactions on the Monero blockchain cannot be linked to a particular user or real-world identity.For instance, buyers of cannabis might prefer paying in Monero, given that cannabis is legal in Canada, but illegal in most jurisdictions outside Canada. Many see Monero as the most suitable currency for cannabis purchases in Canada.How do you think the implementation of the hard fork will affect Monero\u2019s adoption rate?

Bitcoin\u2019s inability to break above $4,000 appears to place a damper of momentum within the wider market. A break seems imminent \u2014 but in which direction? One-Hour ChartEthereum is steadily consolidating into a tighter range, notching lower highs and seemingly on the verge of dropping below the 12 and 26 EMA on the 4hr chart. The 4hr and daily chart show Ethereum remains above the ascending trendline with demonstrated support at the 50-MA ($133.40), $132 and $130. The 12 EMA has crossed below the 26 EMA in the face of declining volume and a retest of the 50-MA and 23.6 percent Fib retracement level seems more likely than not. Dips to swing lows at and below $130 have attracted buyers.ETH-USD LongsEthereum price longs are reapproaching all-time highs and near the level and there is a history of longs unwinding above 510,000. If the ETH price is able to overcome the $138 and $140 resistance and longs increase, then the possibility of traders taking profits from the recent swing lows increases. Therefore, traders might exercise caution when buying into strength and entries near the swing lows could be a more sensible strategy. Where do you think ETH price will go over the short-term?

I was lucky enough to receive a review device and have been dutifully putting it through its paces since then. With the first units shipping next week, its high time to get excited all over again with a full review. Getting StartedLet\u2019s get this out of the way first \u2014 the Ledger Nano X is a beautiful piece of kit. It comes nicely packaged with Apple-level attention to detail.In the box, you get the device itself, a keychain attachment, and tough-looking braided USB cable \u2014 plus instruction sheet, recovery cards, and Ledger stickers \u2014 if you\u2019re into that kind of thing.The device looks very similar to the Nano S, although the buttons have moved to be either side of the larger and flush screen. The two buttons scroll through menu options while pressing both simultaneously selects the highlighted option.The set-up is a simple affair, although I would recommend doing it in one session. In my excitement, I started up the device whilst still in Vegas, then realized I should be taking notes\u2026 and of course, Vegas doesn\u2019t allow notes. It took a bit of fiddling to get back to the set-up process once I was back home, but it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if I\u2019d just waited.Bizarrely, I managed to change the device name on my device, but Ledger Live still sees it as the default name. Now, I can\u2019t seem to alter it at all \u2014 but it\u2019s not a huge deal.Ledger LiveMost of your interaction with the Nano X will occur via the Ledger Live app, for Android and iOS. I mean, you could use it through the desktop version, but there\u2019s no reason why you would \u2013 and, in fact, one good reason why you wouldn\u2019t\u2026 but more on that later.The device connects to the mobile app via Bluetooth, which has sparked security concerns from some quarters. However, private keys remain safely stored in the secure chip on the device, which has been updated and has a higher rating than that of the Nano S.The Nano X supports all 1100+ cryptocurrencies of the earlier model, but you can install 100 different token accounts on a single Nano X \u2014 compared to 18 on the S. Installing accounts is a breeze, although there is no way to change the default account name until after you have created it. Again, not a massive problem, but I don\u2019t see why this shouldn\u2019t be possible.More of an issue is the fact that, if you do at any point decide to use the desktop version of the software, you have to manually add all the accounts again\u2026 and the accounts again take the default name. Why it doesn\u2019t sync accounts (or at least account names) with the device/mobile app is a mystery. To be honest, though, the desktop app has no extra functionality, so you might as well just stick to the mobile app.This works just like any software wallet, allowing you to send and receive tokens, monitor your portfolio, and even buy tokens through selected partner exchanges. Every transaction is confirmed through Nano X, and this is its strength.The Bottom LineThe combination of hardware-wallet security with the mobility and ease-of-use of a software wallet makes this a pretty compelling purchase. Niggles aside, what\u2019s not to like about that?The Ledger Nano X costs $119, with free shipping, and orders placed today should be shipped in early April.What do you think of the Ledger Nano X? Will you upgrade from the Ledger Nano S? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!The Rundown Getting StartedLedger LiveThe Bottom Line"}

All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsSpeaking with CBS in a rare interview last night, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave some of his thoughts on the local and global economies. The divergence of which, as Powell puts it, is cause for remaining cautious.Because the global economy is reliant on the US Dollar, the Fed is having a difficult time normalizing monetary policy even though things are great at home, because of the possible effect on other markets. More than that though, Powell noted possible risks from the slow down in China and Brexit.It is possible that these risks are the reason the stock market just closed its worst week so far this year (purple rectangle), which isn\u2019t saying much as it\u2019s been a fantastic year. Markets are looking bright this morning in Asia and Europe, and it will be interesting to see how we handle the US session.The KSA\u2019s Grip on OilSometimes you need to take a step back in order to gain ground.This is exactly what Saudi Arabia is trying to do with the oil market. The Kingdom\u2019s clients have reportedly requested a total of 7.6 million barrels per day yet, according to reports, they only plan to supply 7 million.As the United States has now been mostly energy independent for the last six months, and Venezuela is unable to provide any sort of stable production, the KSA is determined to limit supply as much as possible in order to drive up prices and regain their dominance.News like this would be cause enough for a rally across the energy sector just a few years ago but today oil is having trouble regaining it\u2019s monthly high (purple circle).When employing the above strategy of taking a step back, it could also backfire, making it difficult to regain the ground given up.Last week, Norway has announced one of the largest divestments from oil and gas stocks in history as the country moves towards a cleaner sovereign investment portfolio. Not sure how this impacts things but just wanted to throw it in there as I believe it points to a wider trend of investors becoming a bit more conscientious.Happy Alt SeasonWith bitcoin lagging behind while other cryptos surge, the feeling is that the crypto winter is coming to a close and it is now alt season.Of course, there\u2019s no telling how long this could last but the signs are all in place. Global volume across crypto exchanges is holding steady at around $30 billion per day, yet bitcoin\u2019s volume is less than a third of that figure. Sure, bitcoin exchange volumes are still about double what they were in early February, but some coins like Litecoin, EOS, and BNB have more than tripled their daily volumes in the same time frame.As most coins are traded against BTC, with bitcoin being the base currency for most altcoins, the fact that volumes are down is very telling of the current market environment.As well, we\u2019re noticing a sudden drop in transactions on the bitcoin blockchain since the start of the month\u2026Don\u2019t get me wrong, BTC remains the most stable of the cryptos and the Bitcoin dominance index is holding well above 50%, despite some of the surges in the smaller coins.It\u2019s just that, as we pull out of the crypto winter, many traders are looking for more than just stable.Over the weekend it was Stellar\u2019s turn for double-digit gains. From Friday morning until the time of this writing it hit a total rise of 23%.This type of action is typical of an alt season as investors rush into whatever\u2019s moving at the moment and try to catch the next wave.Happy surfing!Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalysteToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

Coinflex Gaining SteamCoinflex presents itself as the world\u2019s first physically-delivered cryptocurrency futures exchange.According to a press release, the platform has managed to attract two more high-profile investors in the face of Barry Silbert\u2019s Digital Currency Group and Polychain Capital. They have joined a consortium of other investors in the project, including Dragonfly Capital Partners, Roger Ver, and Trading Technologies.FLEXin\u2019 and Finessin\u2019Per the same release, the platform also introduced its very own FLEX Coin \u2014 a token designed to promote liquidity and to reward early trading activity. According to the announcement, traders will receive a certain amount of FLEX proportional to the volume that they trade and relative to the total daily volume on the exchange.Speaking on the matter was Mark Lamb, CEO at Coinflex, who noted:With FLEX Coin we want to reward early traders of the platform and build loyalty using a shared exchange coin. [\u2026] We have a growing set of high profile backers, a clear roadmap for delivery and are moving closer to our goal of helping crypto futures trading achieve its full potential.Is Bakkt Lagging Behind?Physically-delivered bitcoin futures are at the core of another much anticipated digital trading platform \u2014 Bakkt. The idea behind physically-settled futures is that, at the time of the contract\u2019s expiration, the trader will receive the underlying asset instead of a cash payment.The platform was supposed to go live in December 2018, pending regulatory approval. As Bitcoinist reported, however, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is expected to approve its Bitcoin-settled futures contract at some point at the beginning of 2019 \u2014 which still hasn\u2019t happened.Among the latest updates on Bakkt is from Jan 14, when it made its very first acquisition in order to expand compliance capabilities.What do you think of Coinflex\u2019s progress?

The latest confirmation of this comes from data collected by Google, which shows that the topic \u2018altcoins\u2019 is now trending.Altcoins are defined as any cryptoasset that is not bitcoin, so google\u2019s data includes such search terms as Litecoin, Ethereum, and XRP within the broader topic.Don\u2019t get me wrong, Bitcoin is by far still the dominant player in the crypto industry. In fact, if you use the same google trends tool to compare bitcoin with the alts, altcoins is just a flat line. Bitcoin also leads by market share, currently with 51% of the total market cap.The results of a recent Twitter poll also showed that 90% of participants believe that investors should hold some level of BTC in their portfolio, with a whopping 42% saying that this level should be around 70%.Still, the idea that your investment can double or triple in value in a short period of time is very tempting for alternative investors, even if the degree of risk is notably higher.@MatiGreenspaneToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsBrextensionSmoke them Cannabis ShortsCrypto Consolidating GainsPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of March 14th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsThe UK government voted yesterday in overwhelming opposition of a \u2018no-deal Brexit\u2019. It\u2019s important to note that this vote is not legally binding though and should there be no deal or no time extension, it is exactly what will happen.Today Parliament will vote on whether to ask the EU for a time extension. Just as I\u2019m writing it seems that Europe may be glad to oblige. This tweet out just now from the President of the European Council is circulating fast.Tilray Shorts Too MuchCannabis stocks have been popular with investors since the wave of legalization starting sweeping over the United States\u2026.It seems however that another trend is sweeping in the US stock markets\u2026 shorting cannabis stocks. According to this report out from Bloomberg\u2019s BNN, there aren\u2019t enough Tilray stocks available in client\u2019s long term holdings for investors to short.See, when a client sells short the broker generally needs to borrow the stock from a long term holder in order to facilitate the position. Then when the client closes the short position, the broker returns the stocks to the long term holder.While the atmosphere in the stock market has been rather neutral lately, with investors looking for a good deal, and Tilray down 76% from it\u2019s all-time high in September, it leaves me wondering if this market isn\u2019t set up for a short squeeze.Crypto ConsolidationThe crypto rally may have lost some of its momentum, as volumes across exchanges do seem to be tapering off from their recent highs but remain elevated just under $30 billion per day.Bitcoin remains rather flat, still trying to break through the interim resistance at $4,000.Yesterday\u2019s altseason winner was Stellar Lumens, which was no doubt buoyed by the announcement that it too will be included in Coinbase Pro.At this point, it seems that the altseason has entered a new phase, where the super small cap coins are the ones gaining the most interest and the more established industry incumbents are seeing only moderate advances.Indeed, it remains the case that one of the strongest uses for crypto is the democratization of venture funding. Indeed, several popular crypto websites are in the process of setting up dedicated projects to aid ICO funding projects. Following the success of Binance Launchpad, it seems that Bittrex, and now OKex are working on similar services.Yes, ICOs are extremely risky but investing startups always is. That hasn\u2019t stopped venture capitalists from participating in funding new companies over the last few decades, though. Following the ICO craze of 2017 people are a lot more familiar with these associated risks and are quickly learning how to mitigate them.Let\u2019s have an awesome day!Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalysteToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

But since the derivatives product was USD settled, many commentators are bullish on the news. No New CBOE Bitcoin Futures Contracts The Chicago Futures Exchanges (CFE) of the The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has revealed it will no longer offer any new contracts for its cash-sttled XBT Bitcoin futures product moving forward. However, existing contracts will still be available for trading, the latest of which are set to expire in June 2019. The exchange will now evaluate whether XBT futures and possibly other digital derivative products will see the light of day in the future. \u201cCFE is not adding a Cboe Bitcoin (USD) (\u201cXBT\u201d) futures contract for trading in March 2019,\u201d the official announcement reads.CFE is assessing its approach with respect to how it plans to continue to offer digital asset derivatives for trading. While it considers its next steps, CFE does not currently intend to list additional XBT futures contracts for trading. Currently listed XBT futures contracts remain available for trading.The announcement may not come as a surprise given the declining volumes of XBT that was rolled out to much fanfare in December 2017 \u2013 when Bitcoin price hit its historic all time high of nearly $20,000 USD. Since launch, XBT has been losing ground to Bitcoin futures from The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), whose volume has dwarfed XBT\u2019s in recent month despite starting neck and neck. Last month, Bitcoinist reported that the two products have hit yearly lows in terms of volume. Though CME\u2019s BTC futures still saw roughly $1.5 billion in monthly volume for December 2018 compared to a paltry $250 million from the CBOE.In fact, XBT has never broken the $2 billion mark in its history. On the other hand, CME\u2019s bitcoin futures saw a record high volume of nearly $5 billion in July 2018 and have consistently shown to be more popular among traders, particularly in recent months.Market Chose the Better ContractXBT\u2019s falling volumes is likely why the CBOE decided to cede the market to CME, though no official reason was given.At the same time, commentators reacted to the news with some predicting a positive effect on the market since the XBT product was cash-settled.\u201cSimply put, the costs of continuance outweigh the benefits in $$$ terms,\u201d wrote Twitter user Robin H. Justice. \u201cMy sentiments: good riddance. All bitcoin futures should be settled physically so the insider power money cheaters find it more risky and expensive to play futures off spot and vice versa.\u201dAnother commentator simply stated that the \u201cmarket chose the better contract.\u201dBitcoin investor Trace Mayer sarcastically added that he wants prices to remain lower for longer, hinting that the end of cash-settled bitcoin futures may start the thaw of \u2018crypto winter.\u2019\u201cI sure hope CBOE, with USD settled Bitcoin futures, does not think that mild crypto [winter] may be coming to an end,\u201d he wrote.\u201d Need it colder! Lately, all-time high Bitcoin volume. Consequently, gift of cheap BTC to HODLers of Last Resort.\u201dBitcoin peaked in price when the CBOE futures launched. When the futures end in June we can then start the next bull run. \ud83d\ude80\u2014 Tony Gallippi (@TonyGallippi) March 15, 2019BitPay co-founder Tony Gallippi also believes that this could set the stage for the next bull run since the bitcoin bear market has coincided with XBT.What\u2019s more, several new bitcoin futures products \u2013some of which will be settled in actual bitcoin\u2013are expected to go live some time this year. Firms such as Bakkt, ErisX, Nasdaq, and CoinFLEX are set to launch their digital asset trading platforms over the next few months.It will be interesting to watch how the physical bitcoin-settled products, in particular, will affect bitcoin price 00 once they go live.Do you think the removal of cash-settled bitcoin futures will have a positive effect on the market?

We cannot look lightly upon the criminal responsibility of the defendant.Five Years Of HellMt. Gox collapsed in early 2014 after the exchange lost a giant 850,000 bitcoins to malicious parties, of which some were later recovered.Karpeles gained considerable negative publicity throughout the debacle and ensuing legal process, with angry users who lost money broadly accusing him of negligence.The ex-CEO has consistently protested his innocence, while appearing to reinvent himself in the interim period, losing a considerable amount of weight during his previous detention over the accusations.Meanwhile, the procedure selling off bitcoin funds to repay users has caused controversy of its own over the past year.

In January 2018, the scheme shut down, leaving BitConnect investors holding coins, which immediately lost 90 percent of their value. The cryptocurrency and entity behind it gained internet notoriety prior to the shutdown, most due to representative Carlos Matos, who created multiple catchphrases for the BitConnect project.Tarrant did not give further details about his investment, and it remains unknown how much he was able to obtain from it, or whether the funds had a direct impact on the crimes he subsequently committed.The threat of terrorist activity involving cryptocurrency remains a preoccupation of authorities worldwide. While literature often brings up worries over its use in crime, other studies have questioned the extent to which organized terrorists in particular are able to leverage cryptocurrency within their operations.

This time, the U.S. will be prohibiting payment firms like Visa and Mastercard from providing service in the country.The move is a continuation of efforts to cut off access to funds to President Maduro and other allies of the government in Venezuela. Sources say the plan could also affect companies in strategic sectors like aviation, agriculture, and power to mention a few.Apart from U.S.-based Visa and Mastercard, other international payment processors could also pull out from the country for fear of being targeted by the U.S. government.Bitcoin the Only Hope for Those Caught in the CrossfireIf the plan does go through, it would mean a further exacerbation of an already dire economic situation for many Venezuelans. Granted that some Venezuelans already either unbanked or underbanked, and lacking access to credit, the shuttering of operations by Visa and Mastercard would mean more citizens being cut off from the global economy.It wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see even greater Bitcoin adoption in Venezuela on account of the proposed plan. Earlier in March, Bitcoinist reported that Venezuelans had traded more than $60 million worth of BTC via Localbitcoins since the start of 2019.However, the onset of a prolonged power outage in the country did see Bitcoin trading volume drop by about 40 percent for the week ending March 9. With the prospect of further financial difficulties on the horizon, Bitcoin users will probably be looking for ways of going around the problem.Censorship-Resistant BitcoinWith a single government proclamation, millions of people can become economically disenfranchised, all in the service of establishing global domination. While the reasons for such measures might seem justified, they do not account for the accompanying social cost relegated to the confines of \u201ccollateral damage.\u201dBitcoin is politically nuetral and borderless by design. It exists on a spectrum far-removed from state-censorship, which is one of the biggest reasons it continues to gain greater adoption across the world.Thus, while governments can pressure Visa and Mastercard to cut service, Bitcoin remains apolitical, global, and free from government censorship.Soon the U.S. might prohibit payment companies from processing transactions in an entire country. Surely, not everyone affected will be a member of the Maduro posse.Those caught in the cross-fire will turn more to Bitcoin to survive.

Christina Comben | Mar 15, 2019 | 18:00 Share Tweet Send Share Underscoring the fact that blockchain development takes time, after five years of work, Cosmos launched its mainnet yesterday. This leads to an important question\u2013what is Cosmos anyway?What Is Cosmos?A project developed under the premise that there should be as many blockchains as there are internet applications. The focus is on delivering the industry a network of interoperable blockchains that are independent and scalable. Through this, Cosmos claims to solve the \u201chardest blockchain problems.\u201dThe team believes that blockchains should no longer be \u201csiloed\u201d or unable to communicate with each other. Their network does away with this issue and provides the foundation of the new token economy. How?5 Years in the MakingCosmos was conceived in 2014 when Jae Kwon noted that the:Safety-favoring nature of classical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms would allow us to use Proof of Stake (PoS) for Sybil resistance in a public blockchain context without the need for external sources of pseudorandomness.He was then joined one year later by Ethan Buchman. They set about their quest to prove that a secure public blockchain could use the BFT system running on Proof of Stake. And to do this, they created the Cosmos Hub, which officially launched yesterday.The goal is to provide infrastructure and a developer hub that\u2019s robust, and scalable\u2013without using Proof of Work:The vision is to enable communication and connectivity among thousands of cryptocurrency systems, allowing the network to scale without utilizing Proof-of-Work.The duo developed Tendermint Core as a BFT consensus engine to provide the first layer for any PoS blockchain to build on. To become as developer-friendly and accessible as possible, Cosmos claims to have lowered the barrier to entry for developing DApps by creating Cosmos SDK. According to the team, Cosmos SDK is rather like Ruby on Rails or Django for blockchain. It\u2019s supposedly easy to use and allows programmers to customize their DApps for their business.A Few Facts That Give Cosmos CredibilityThe Cosmos Hub blockchain marks the first public BFT blockchain using PoS\u2013that\u2019s an industry record.It\u2019s also backed by some big names, including investors such as Paradigm, and Bain Capital. The Swiss Interchain Foundation (ICF) is also collaborating on R&D with the project. Why Cosmos Could Be Just Another Sh*tcoinCosmos assures in its blog post that its project is quickly expanding. But there isn\u2019t any evidence of that just yet. The project took five years to come to life and it will be some time more before its lofty claims can be validated, particularly in the real world.Moreover, until the handful of validators on its testnets and 80 or so developers that \u201chave indicated they are building\u201d applications with Cosmos SDK have begun providing feedback, it may be too early for Cosmos to announce the completion of its vision as the \u201cInternet of Blockchains\u201d just yet.Do you think Cosmos can live up to its promise?

Unlike his last year\u2019s predictions, however, this time he\u2019s seemingly shielding his positivity with conditions. Tom Lee Back At It, HesitantlyIn April 2018, Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee said that Bitcoin\u2019s price will hit $25,000 by the end of the year. On December 31st, 2018, however, the cryptocurrency was trading at around $3,700 \u2013 approximately 85 percent below Lee\u2019s target price.Speaking on CNBC\u2019s Futures Now, Lee seems to have maintained his positivity on Bitcoin, despite his previously failed predictions.The analyst thinks that 2019 will be a \u201cyear about repair.\u201d This time, he\u2019s evidently a lot more cautious and conservative with his price targets. Lee outlined that it\u2019s very important for bitcoin price 00 to recover the damaged sustained during the fork war between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Cash SV.I think the damage that needs to really be repaired is that collapse from $6,000 to $3,100, which came after the fork wars with Bitcoin Cash. [\u2026] I think it really undermined investor confidence in sort of the dynamics around the market, so I think that bitcoin\u2019s going to spend a lot of time below $6,000 sort of fixing itself.According to the specialist, the \u201coutside is five or six months before bitcoin starts to look technically like it\u2019s back in a bull market.\u201dBut there\u2019s a catch. In order for Bitcoin to cross its 200-day moving average in that period, it needs to maintain its current trading price around $4,000, suggesting that any serious dip downwards could throw Lee\u2019s prediction down the drain.\u2018Bitcoin\u2019s Becoming Quite Useful\u2019Lee outlined that Bitcoin\u2019s technicals are starting to show stabilization, as the cryptocurrency is \u201cbouncing along\u201d its 200-week moving average.However, Lee maintains that there\u2019s a bigger picture to keep in mind.The real story is the fundamental one, that bitcoin\u2019s becoming quite useful. [\u2026] We\u2019ve seen the launch of digital currencies by not only J.P. Morgan and Mizuho Bank, but also Facebook and some social media companies gearing up. And, of course, in places like Venezuela, where bitcoin\u2019s become very large and widely used, turmoil is causing adoption growth. So I think these are really setting up for a strong \u2026 year.While JPM announced its stablecoin dubbed \u201cJPM Coin\u201d earlier in February, it has since received a substantial amount of criticism, with industry proponents such as Abra\u2019s CEO calling it \u201cnonsense.\u201dWhen asked about whether new cryptocurrencies issued by marquee companies such as Facebook and JPMorgan Chase would take away investors\u2019 attention from Bitcoin, he responded:In a world where there are 50 million active wallets today and 5 billion Visa cardholders, clearly the crypto market can just grow because of adoption.It\u2019s not the first time Lee\u2019s pulling out the adoption card. However, data from Blockchain.com shows that the number of Blockchain wallets is currently around 34 million. While this number has been increasing steadily, it\u2019s still nowhere near 50 million.What do you think of Tom Lee\u2019s current position on Bitcoin?

No One Does it Better Than TetherTether 00 has regularly come under suspicion over its claims that it\u2019s 1-to-1 backed by the US Dollar and that it has been used to manipulate Bitcoin prices. In June 2018, Bitcoinist reported on a paper by two researchers at the University of Texas, who claimed to have identified potential evidence of direct price manipulation since November 2017.In December, however, the rumors about its dollar peg began looking increasingly thin. Bank statements revealed that $2.2 billion was present in Tether\u2019s account at Puerto Rico\u2019s Noble Bank on January 31st in 2018. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that the same amount of Tethers existed back then.Just a few short months later, the company has once again managed to turn the cryptocurrency community against itself, with a controversial change in its TOS.Social media users noticed that they had removed the previous claims that Tether was fully backed by US Dollars. Instead, that\u2019s what the site currently says:Every tether is always 100% backed by our reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities (collectively, \u201creserves\u201d). Every tether is also 1-to-1 pegged to the dollar, so 1 USD\u20ae is always valued by Tether at 1 USD.So It BeganUsers on different social media platforms, including Reddit and Twitter, quickly took aim at the controversial move.Popular cryptocurrency commentator IamNomad outlined that there\u2019s a reason for real concerns, saying:\u201c\u2026without clarification \u201cloans to third parties\u201d and \u201ccollaterial\u201d could mean a whole mess of things. Are they being put in some 30d cash bond (ie corporate loan) to get intrest or worse case lending it out on bitfinex margin pool.\u201dwithout clarification \"loans to third parties\" and \"collaterial\" could mean a whole mess of things. Are they being put in some 30d cash bond (ie corporate loan) to get intrest or worse case lending it out on bitfinex margin pool\u2014 I am Nomad (@IamNomad) March 14, 2019Since then, Tether has issued a formal statement on the matter, outlining that the change in the TOS was communicated directly to customers through a \u201crequired active opt in.\u201d The company reassures its users that \u201cTethers remain completely stable and 100% backed, because Tether\u2019s reserves always equal or exceed the number of issued Tethers.\u201dIt\u2019s Not That Simple, ThoughDespite Tether\u2019s announcement, the controversy maintains.\u201cSlippery language by Tether. \u201c100% backed\u201d <=> \u201cmay also include receivables from loans issued.\u201d Imo this is a clear transition from full to fractional reserve banking,\u201d noted Tuur Demeester, founding partner at Adamant Capital.It\u2019s easy to see why one would be concerned that his Tethers might not be backed by US dollars, but rather than \u201creceivables from loans issued.\u201dWhat do you think of Tether\u2019s updated TOS?

All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsStocks are on fire today as both Donald Trump and Theresa May have been delivered resounding defeats, each from their own respective parties.May seems to have lost all decision-making power, as the UK Parliament now seems to be fully in the driving seat. We could very well be headed towards a long Brextension. (Did you cringe reading that amalgamation? I did when writing it.)The Senate voted to deny Trump\u2019s budget proposal, with several Republicans turning on their President. The kicker on the geopolitical front this morning though is the rhetoric from Trump who seems to be playing hard to get with China.None of this is bothering the stock markets though. The rally on Wall Street has continued straight into the Asian and European sessions. Here\u2019s the Dow Jones forming a rather bullish pattern over the last few days\u2026Normally, I don\u2019t like to use technical analysis on an index, simply because indices are made up of many components and so they don\u2019t necessarily pay as much attention to arbitrary lines, but I do feel that the above pattern is an accurate display of overall sentiment in the markets at the moment.Everyone clearly wants to go higher but it\u2019s difficult to stretch the limitations of valuations and brush aside risks that are clearly prevalent.Bank of Japan Not ExcitedOne of those risks was highlighted by the Bank of Japan this morning, which downgraded its expectations for their own economy.The announcement did end up causing some volatility on the Japanese Yen, but after the dust settled it\u2019s pretty clear that the market wasn\u2019t all together shocked by this update.The chart on the left shows the short term movements in the USDJPY pair and the one on the right has this morning\u2019s volatility inside a small purple circle. I think the trend is pretty clear here. The US Dollar is strengthening against the Yen as the FED seems to be considering hinting at raising rates while Japan seems to be going in the opposite direction.Bitcoin DelistedThere were more than a few gasps in the crypto social media circles after the news that the CBOE will be phasing out their bitcoin futures contracts.There are currently enough contracts to last them through June, but as they will not be issuing any new ones, for the time being, we can expect them to be completely delisted by then.Sure, this is a bit sad but I\u2019m not too phased. The CBOE contracts weren\u2019t delivering a lot of volumes anyway. The dominant player on Wall Street remains the CME Group, whose bitcoin futures remain in play.It\u2019s also important to note that neither of the above-mentioned futures markets are actually settled in Bitcoin. They are both cash settled, meaning that two players trade against each other based on the price, and the loser forks over USD to the winner, so Bitcoin is never moved by this market. Whether or not the players had other positions in other markets is a different story.In any case, according to all currently public information, the Nasdaq seems to be gearing up to offer its own bitcoin futures and it could very well be available before June. So, overall the news isn\u2019t really very bad at all.Looking at crypto prices this morning, it seems as if we\u2019ve got a strong rally brewing. I\u2019ve put up a few graphs for you on twitter that may be helpful to see how and why.Have an amazing day ahead!Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalystYour Social Investment Network \u2013 www.eToro.comeToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

Let\u2019s take a look.Fibonacci RetracementIf we take a look at the Fibonacci retracement tool and draw a simple line from the all-time high to its most recent bottom, we can see that the price of Litecoin (LTC) against Bitcoin (BTC) has largely respected each channel while stair-stepping upwards.After bursting through 0.011 BTC and consolidating the yellow channel, Litecoin subsequently burst through 0.014 BTC. Today, the price of \u2018silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold\u2019 bounced off what will most probably provide some serious resistance \u2014 0.016 BTC. This level acted as previous support from April to mid-June 2018. Knowing that past support frequently becomes resistance, it stands to reason that LTC will have trouble breaking through this level without further consolidation and a healthy pullback.Relative Strength IndexesThe daily relative strength index (RSI) has once again entered the overbought territory, which signals that the price of Litecoin (LTC) may need to cool off.More alarming, however, is the severe bearish divergence which continues to rear its ugly head. As you can see in the above chart, the price of Litecoin continues to rise and put in higher highs while the RSI continues to decline. This is generally a bearish signal that the price needs to correct itself and now seems like a ripe time for Litecoin to experience a major profit-taking event as it runs up against a significant level of past support.Support LevelsShould Litecoin (LTC) experience a pullback in the near future, there are significant levels of support underneath that should prevent a massive decline.The exponential moving average (EMA) ribbon, for example, stands to provide the first lines of defense against the bears. These lines would likely match the Fibonacci level between 0.0135 and 0.014 BTC.In the event of a major profit-taking event and a massive red candle, the 200-week moving average (blue line) would be the last line of defense. A close below that level would be downright catastrophic \u2014 but that is currently unlikely and not worth fretting over.The views and opinions of the writer should not be misconstrued as financial advice.

The event highlights the layer-two scaling solution\u2019s progression in the short span of only 13 months. [Editor\u2019s note: The original version of this article incorrectly stated that Lightning Network mainnet was launched on March 15, 2018. The first mainnet daemon implementation was actually C-Lightning launched a month earlier.]Bitcoin Lightning Network: Happy Birthday!One year ago, on March 15th, Lightning Labs CEO, Elizabeth Stark, announced one of the first official beta implementations of the Lightning Network. The solution saw support from Twitter\u2019s CEO Jack Dorsey, Tesla and SpaceX investor Bill Lee, backing from computer giant Microsoft, and other prominent members of the cryptocurrency community.A little over one year later, the Lighting Network (LN) has come a long way after first LND daemon launching on mainnet in February 2018. According to LN monitoring website 1ML, the network\u2019s capacity is 1,056.83 BTC or more than $4.2 million, marking a 54 percent increase over the last 30 days alone.The number of channels has also jumped with more than 47 percent in the last month, currently standing at 39,222. The number of nodes is 7,381 \u2013 17.89 percent increase throughout the same period.Moreover, the actual adoption of the LN is also making serious advances. Twitter\u2019s CEO, Jack Dorsey praised the scaling solution, outlining that it\u2019s only a matter of time for it to come to Twitter:It\u2019s not an \u2018if;\u2019 it\u2019s more of a \u2018when\u2019 \u2013 how do we make sure that we\u2019re getting the speed that we need and the efficiency?LN also gained massive attention thanks to an initiative by user hodlonaut called the Lightning Torch.

Let\u2019s take a look at what this might mean going into the rest of the weekend.Bitcoin Price: 4-Hour ChartLooking at the 4-hour chart, we can see that Bitcoin price 00 bolted out of the gates almost immediately after Friday\u2019s candle close, breaking the weekly range high of $3950 which we discussed earlier this week.The bears stepped in and pushed bitcoin price back from highs of $4040 back down to $4000 at the time of writing.The next objective for the bulls is that they now need to flip the prior resistance of $3950 into support.Looking at the chart, we can see that there was an early sign of price looking to trend higher, with the OBV and MACD both breaking out to the upside around noon on Friday.Both of these are trending higher with no sign of slowing down at present but should be observed closely over the weekend to identify where market momentum may be at risk.1-Day ChartLooking at the 1-day chart, we can see that there is are multifaceted arguments available to support the case that the bulls want to take this market higher, with the latest being a lower time frame breakout in the 14-month declining resistance and now an inverted head and shoulders forming, which would also act as a third higher low for Bitcoin.Should the bulls capitalize at this point, the measured move target will be towards $5k, however, we remain in a bear market. A voluminous break and close above $4200 would be extremely encouraging for the bulls. However, another failure to break the $4k handle will be a stark reminder that the bears are still very much in control.Weekly ChartA quick preview of the weekly chart shows that bitcoin is still being capped by the center line of the Bollinger Bands, which is the 20-week moving average.This has been the bull\u2019s nemesis all the way through this bear market as occurred during the 2014 decline, which was ultimately broken in July 2015. This ultimately became the indicator that the bottom was in.However, the bands (being two standard deviations from the 20WMA), are still very wide, which implies that a move now by either party would potentially carry a large range with it, with the highs of the bands being around $5500 and the lows being $2330.In addition, the Stoch RSI also looks to be ready to roll over in the overbought zone, but this could still take some time to occur and is contrary to the MACD.As we have seen several times before these markets can take some time to bottom. Indeed, although looking positive at the moment, this is not a done deal yet and there could be several more attempts to break this bear market.Overall this is an important and pivotal point for bitcoin price. As we talked earlier in the week, pressure continues to build in this market and it is only a matter of time before a more significant move occurs.Trade Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

In addition to BTC, other altcoins that will be accepted include Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Cash SV (BSV), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), Litecoin (LTC), TRON (TRX), OmiseGo (OMG), and NEO (NEO).\u201cCryptocurrencies are fascinating and could become a relevant means of payment in e-commerce. We would like to support this development,\u201d says Digitec co-founder Oliver Herren and Chief Innovation Officer. \u201cWe wanted to do that for a long time, but the effort was too long for a long time.\u201d When asked why his company is willing to accept these alternative means of payments, Herren explained:Because you have some and you want to use them. Or because you cannot turn them into real money because your bank does not accept it. Or maybe just because your can and like to try new things.The company admits, however, that it is mainly doing this to score points with the younger, tech-savvy crowd by positioning itself as a forward-thinking company.At the same time, price volatility will not be a problem, the company says. All transactions are processed by third-party payment processor Coinify and immediately converted to Swiss francs.However, the new payment option will only be available for Swiss customers first. If the initiative becomes a success, though, the company will extend the option to German customers as well.The procedure is pretty straightfoward. At checkout, the customer will choose the payment option \u201ccryptocurrencies.\u201d They will then be redirected to the Coinify website where the specific crypto coin is selected. The given exchange rate will be fixed for 15 minutes and the page will display an address as well as a QR-code, to which the user will send the payment. While Digitec Galaxus will not charge any fees for cryptocurrency payments, Coinify will charge conversion fee of 1.5 percent of the purchase amount.Other Swiss Retailers Likely to FollowNow, with the online retail market leader taking such a bold step, it\u2019s likely that its competitors will follow suit, particularly in a country where bitcoin adoption has gained a foothold. In fact, Switzerlad has been a hotbed for bitcoin adoption and the blockchain industry. It regularly hosts cryptocurrency events and its stock exchange has rolled out cryptocurrency-tied products such as a Bitcoin ETP. The country is also home to many crypto startups who have found a home in the Swiss city of Zug, also known as \u2018Crypto valley.\u2019 What\u2019s more, residents of the city can pay for municipal services in bitcoin. It is even possible to buy BTC at the country\u2019s Fedral railway system kiosk at every station. Unlike, the train ticket initiative however, which was criticized in media reports as expensive and opaque, Digitec Galaxus says its payment process will be easier and more transparent.When you buy something from Digitec or Galaxus, the rate will be fixed for 15 minutes. This means that as a buyer you do not have to fear bad surprises, says the company. Additionally, the move may also help the company sell more cryptocurrency products such as hardware wallets to customers who prefer to pay directly with crypto.Digitec is Switzerland\u2019s online market leader with Galaxus being the largest Swiss online shop offering a wide range of everyday products with fast and free delivery. The company generated sales of 992 million francs in 2018.Will other retailers follow Digitec Galaxus?

It seems that all the geopolitical tensions that have been weighing on the markets over the last few months have suddenly been brushed aside in a wave of risk appetite.That said, there\u2019s plenty of stuff to look out for this week that could potentially rock the markets. Perhaps above all will be the Fed meeting this Wednesday.The US Federal Reserve is firmly in control of the financial markets at the moment so speculation on what they might do will likely be the focus of this weeks volatility, or lack thereof.As we can see, the VIX volatility index is at its lowest point in more than six months.Who Controls the Oil?Crude oil has been on a run lately, largely based on supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and energy shortages in Venezuela.This morning, Saudi Oil Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih, seemingly speaking on behalf of OPEC and all of their allies, reiterated that the cartel will be able to meet the necessary production cuts to send the price higher in the weeks to come.Still, the US, UK, and Brazil continue to produce more and more. So OPEC and even the new OPEC+, which includes Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kuwait, and several others, are only half the story and the battle continues.By the chart, it does seem like the price is running into a bit of weakness within the upward channel (yellow lines) ahead of the strong psychological barrier at $60 a barrel (blue line).OPEC+ members will reportedly be meeting in Jeddah this May, presumably to try and push the price further up. President Trump has been tweeting quite a bit trying to push the price of oil down. Who will win?Altseason ContinuesCrypto markets surged on Saturday morning but seem to be giving some of that back as we speak.Seemingly leading the charge is Bitcoin Cash (orange), which is up 20% since Friday morning. Far ahead of the runner up Litecoin (blue), which rose 5.6% over the weekend.In further confirmation that we\u2019re in the throes of alt-season, we can see Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has continued to decline over the last month, even though the price of BTC has risen 10% during the same period.Here we can see the Bitcoin Dominance Index that shows BTC\u2019s share of the total market cap has dropped a total of 1.5%, while the \u2018others\u2019 category (silver line), showing the small-cap cryptos has risen 2.2%.At this point, it\u2019s even possible that some of the long term hodlers are getting into the altcoin action. Even though the stigma in the market that Bitcoin is the safe and stable one remains strong, some of the other smaller projects are showing some serious potential.A recent transaction was spotted on the Bitcoin blockchain where 50 BTC were moved from a wallet that hadn\u2019t been touched since they were first mined in November of 2010.The most likely reasons that we can speculate for this type of movement is that the person either really needs to pay some bills, or they\u2019re looking at some other investments in lower tier alts. Given that the individual hodled right through several massive bull and bear runs, I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably more likely the latter.Have an amazing week ahead!Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalysteToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

IBM Blockchain World Wire is \u201ca real-time global payments network for regulated financial institutions\u201d from the American multinational information technology company. It has been created with the purpose of optimizing and quickening foreign exchange, cross-border payments, and remittances \u2014 which has long been one of blockchain technology\u2019s promises.As of this writing, IBM Blockchain World Wire has officially launched payment services in 72 countries with 47 currencies and 44 banking endpoints.Notably, IBM\u2019s blockchain is reportedly the first such implementation to integrate payment messaging, clearing, and settlement \u201cwhile allowing participants to dynamically choose from a variety of digital assets for settlement.\u201d Stated IBM Blockchain General Manager Marie Wieck:We\u2019ve created a new type of payment network designed to accelerate remittances and transform cross-border payments to facilitate the movement of money in countries that need it most. By creating a network where financial institutions support multiple digital assets, we expect to spur innovation and improve financial inclusion worldwide.IBM Blockchain World Wire notably uses the Stellar (XLM) protocol to facilitate point-to-point money transfers. Because it is a blockchain-based protocol, the need for intermediaries is drastically reduced and transactions may be settled in a matter of seconds.Luiz Carlos Brandao Cavalcanti Junior, Innovation and Digital Channels Executive Director at Banco Bradesco, commented:Bradesco continuously adopts innovation that enhances customer experience and improves efficiency. The World Wire Network addresses both of these aspects, and therefore presents a valuable opportunity for Bradesco and its customers in Brazil.Likewise, Manny T. Narcisco, First Senior Vice-President at RCBC, stated:RCBC is pleased to be an early innovator with plans to issue our own Peso stable coin on World Wire, pending final approval from our regulators. We\u2019re focused on innovation that adds value for our customers, and World Wire presents a tremendous opportunity to transform and enhance our payment infrastructure.What do you think of IBM Blockchain World Wire?

Japanese regulators approved on Friday amendments to Japan\u2019s financial instruments and payment services laws that limit the amount of leverage cryptocurrency exchanges may offer users when margin trading. The cap will now be two-to-four times initial deposits \u2014 in line with foreign exchange (forex) trading \u2014 according to a report from Nikkei Asian Review.As expected, cryptocurrency exchanges that offer margin trading will now be required to obtain approval from the Japanese government via registration. The registration process, however, will be distinctly different from the already-existing process created in 2017 that officially recognized digital currencies as legal tender.The new regulations will force cryptocurrency exchanges to accept monitoring in line with securities traders.The regulatory move comes after speculative trading on margin started booming last year. As noted by the report, the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association claims the country reached 8.42 trillion yen in total margin trading in December of last year \u2014 approximately 11x the total amount of cash transactions.The new rules aren\u2019t going to be immediately implemented, however. Rather, they will start being enforced in April 2020, and Nikkei reports that \u201cexchange operators would need to be registered within 18 months of that date.\u201dJapan became a world-leader in cryptocurrency-exchange regulation following the high-profile heist of roughly 500 million NEM (XEM) coins worth half a billion dollars from Coincheck.

This step comes as the cash-strapped Maduro administration continues to seek ways to finance itself in the wake of mounting economic restrictions.Government Eyes Share of Booming Bitcoin MarketEarlier in March 2019, the Maduro regime launched Patria, a state-owned cryptocurrency remittance service. As reported by Bitcoinist, the government also imposed a 15 percent fee on all Bitcoin and cryptocurrency remittance payments on the platform.According to Caracas Chronicles, the move indicates a pivot by the Venezuelan government to benefit from the growing BTC remittance market in the country.Stifling economic restrictions appear to be forcing the government towards profiting from the funds sent by citizens living abroad to their dependents in Caracas and across the country via BTC and other cryptos.The Patria platform also raises up some user privacy issue as it forces the sender to provide identifying information such as national identity card and date of birth. Also, the funds don\u2019t go directly into the wallet of the recipient but one owned by Patria with the receiver getting a notification of the payment.The customer has to visit the Patria website to facilitate the payment into their bank accounts in bolivars. Given the growing daily inflation, it remains to be seen if people would actually adopt the Patria platform.Reports indicate that USD and Bitcoin are preferred to Bolivar, which has become increasingly worthless. A briefcase full of 500 bolivar notes isn\u2019t enough to buy toilet paper these days.Bitcoin P2P Trading in VenezuelaMeanwhile, BTC peer-to-peer (P2P) trading in Venezuela appears to be recovering after dropping during the second week of March 2019. Data from CoinDance shows trading volume for the week ending March 16 at more than 1,800 BTC (about $7.3 million).While some were quick to point to the dip in Bitcoin P2P trading during the power outage, others say people found various workarounds to the lack of internet service caused by the blackout.On a subreddit dedicated to Bitcoin, numerous responders mentioned the use of SMS platforms like CoinTigo for cryptocurrency payments. However, credit/debit card services were completely hamstrung by the power outage that affected more than 70 percent of the country.As previously reported by Bitcoinist, the U.S. government may soon force Visa and Mastercard from facilitating card payments in Venezuela. Such a move could potentially have profound implications for the level of BTC adoption in the country.Do you think the Venezuelan government will be able to realize significant funds from the Patria platform or will residents stick to non-government controlled BTC remittance platforms?

Leading the results was a breakdown of exchange trading volume by jurisdiction, leading Malta come beat countries such as Singapore and the US.\u201cMaltese-registered exchanges represented the majority of trading volume in February (35.9 billion USD) as in previous months, followed closely by those legally registered in Hong Kong (34.5 billion USD) and South Korea (33.2 billion USD),\u201d the report summarizes.As Bitcoinist reported, Malta\u2019s friendly regulatory approach has led multiple big-name exchanges to set up on its shores, including Chinese names OKEx and Huobi in addition to Binance.87 Percent Of Volume \u2018Suspicious\u2019The CryptoCompare figures come at a time when both commentators and market participants are paying increasing attention to exchanges\u2019 reported trade volumes, following publication of further research suggesting many such volumes are highly inaccurate.The product of officials from crypto trading platform The Tie, a dedicated report into the phenomenon appeared March 17. In social media comments on what they discovered, The Tie suggested huge discrepancies in trade volume as reported by many exchanges compared to what would be expected. \u201cIn total we estimated that 87% of exchanges reported trading volume was potentially suspicious and that 75% of exchanges had some form of suspicious activity occurring on them,\u201d they warned.\u2026If each exchange averaged the volume per visit of CoinbasePro, Gemini, Poloniex, Binance, and Kraken, we would expect the real trading volume among the largest 100 exchanges to equal ($2.1 billion) per day. Currently that number is being reported as ($15.9 billion).Binance CEO Warns Over CoinMarketCapThose revelations turn led to criticism from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who suggested exchange ranking resources needed to be more diligent in how they listed market participants.CoinMarketCap, perhaps the best-known such resource, which has a widely-recognized presence throughout the industry, came in for a special mention.Its popularity, Zhao argued, means that non-technical and novice investors could view an exchange as trustworthy due to its reported volumes, but those in the know would take the opposite view and avoid it.\u201c(CoinMarketCap) is [the] highest traffic website in our space, and [the] biggest referrer for all exchanges,\u201d he wrote on Twitter in response to The Tie. Ranked high on (CoinMarketCap) has benefits for getting new users. BUT at the expense of DESTROYING CREDIBILITY with pro users. Many forget the later part.Others commented that rankings should use different metrics altogether, such as order book depth.Beyond exchanges meanwhile, Bitcoinist this week noted on how recent behavior suggests China could be returning as a major investment source in cryptocurrency markets.According to data tracking capital inflow, the yuan was the second-biggest source of cash behind the US dollar this week, with 24-hour volumes hitting $165 million for Bitcoin and almost $75 million for Ethereum.What do you think about exchange volume distribution and authenticity?

Bitcoinist | Mar 19, 2019 | 19:00 Share Tweet Send Share In a globalized world, where people build relationships without physical borders, sending money to another country is still a slow and costly process. Services like Western Union, TransferWise and others have complementary problems: if it is fast, it is expensive; if it is cheap, it is slow. At TransferWise, although the service uses the commercial euro price and has excellent rates, a transfer from Brazil to Portugal can take up to 3 business days and both sender and recipient need to have a bank account in their respective countries.At Western Union, in addition to the transactions that need to be made directly at a company store, in cash, there is also a service fee. The rate, which varies according to the amount sent, is also increased by a higher euro price which ends up wiping the receipt amount.With such a loophole in these operations, the solution seems to have come from an unexpected player in the market. SmartCash, a cryptocurrency focused on day-to-day use, recently released a functionality in its Web wallet that made it possible to send money overseas in less than 5 minutes with no bank account or exorbitant fees.How does SmartCash international transfers work?Available initially in Portugal and Switzerland, transfers take place through ATMs spread across key points in these two European countries.There are a few necessary steps:The sender, through his SmartCash Web Wallet, requests a withdrawal with a specific amount;If funds are available, a QR Code is created;The sender then sends the QR Code to the recipient;The recipient show the QR Code in a compatible ATM and withdraws the amount designated in euros (in Portugal) or Swiss francs (in Switzerland).This sequence happens very quickly, since SmartCash Blockchain has instant transactions.Besides the speed and cost, there is the bonus of convenience. Services where the recipient withdraws cash, generally require the sender to make the transaction at a store, also in cash. In this case, the entire process is done through the SmartCash Web Wallet application.Another interesting point of this service is to use it as your own bank on a visit to Europe. Escaping from taxes or credit card fees, you can withdraw your SMARTs in local currency.Compatible ATMs, managed by BitC and Bitugax, are available in Coimbra, Portugal, and in 11 Swiss cities, including Zurich, Geneva and Bern, with a major expansion plan for the coming months.Much more than borderless transactionsUnlike many other cryptocurrencies, SmartCash has a layer of services built into its platform to truly work as a next-generation financial system with the freedom and security of Blockchain. This includes a merchant application, ecommerce plugins, conversion services, contactless payment card and much more.Meet SmartCash:Official website Telegram Discord Instagram TwitterThe Rundown How does SmartCash international transfers work?Much more than borderless transactions"}

It seems that the two largest German banks are about to get hitched, with the authorities set to flag it through.In an email from Bloomberg this morning, writer John Authers rips into a recent research paper that was published by Deutsche Bank, which is one of the parties involved in the impending merger.As Authers writes, this kind of action would take the concept of too big to fail to an entirely new level that he calls \u201ctoo big to rescue.\u201dIt would be good for the bankers, other than those who will lose their jobs of course, and would be bad for savers, who currently enjoy the competition.

The press release appeared unchanged on several mainstream news platforms, including the Associated Press, Venturebeat and BusinessWire.In it, OnMiners promised Bitcoin hashing power of 140, 270 and 1020 terahashes per second respectively for its three mining rig models, which varied in price from $4500 to $30,000.Those figures, as cryptocurrency YouTube channel host MrSotko noted, immediately seemed suspicious, as the fastest rigs from other companies have not surpassed around 50 terahashes.After examining the provenance of the executives, he said, a pattern began emerging. A Google search for any of OnMiners\u2019 alleged senior staff reveals their mugshots are stock photos, some of which are already used elsewhere online. In the case of one figure, would-be CMO \u2018Megan Powell,\u2019 the photo appears on websites about mistakes made by female entrepreneurs and even fertility trends.The accompanying names for the photos do not correspond to real people with verifiable professional lives or careers.Sound Familiar?Bitcoinist subsequently discovered a general lack of information on OnMiners\u2019 website, with no available details as to the company\u2019s exact whereabouts beyond a street name. Purported features in mainstram media press such as Rueters were also non-existent when attempting to click on the icons. Elsewhere, the image of the company\u2019s reception was found to be photoshopped from that of another business.And then there's the photo of their offices on the about page. pic.twitter.com/ycKxVGbAzj\u2014 Danny Greer (@greerso) March 20, 2019While \u2018representatives\u2019 have yet to provide a response to the mounting allegations, OnMiners\u2019 behavior closely echoes infamous schemes from within the cryptocurrency industry which many have labelled as de facto frauds.Among the best-known is OneCoin, the Bulgarian-run operation which previously received warnings from regulators, governments and commentators alike.After managing to accrue funds for several years, this month, the perpetrators of the scheme finally hit a dead end after US police arrested one of them, Konstantin Ignatov, on suspicion of wire fraud. OneCoin\u2019s total funds are reported to have reached more than $3.7 billion. As Bitcoinist further reported, shadowy behavior has also come from companies which did not gain a reputation as untrustworthy until they suddenly imploded. Among recent examples was Cubits, the UK-based wallet and exchange platform which appeared to bankrupt itself last December.In the event, it appeared Cubits\u2019 executives has ties to the then still functional OneCoin network. Beyond duping investors, however, the major threat to cryptocurrency users remains remote attacks. As data has shown, instances of phenomena such as cryptojacking have increased by orders of magnitude since 2017, as criminals seek to steal passwords to wallets or trick their owners into handing them over. US authorities are also increasingly aware of SIM porting scams, in which an attacker convinces a mobile operator to transfer a victim\u2019s SIM card to their control.What do you think about OnMiners?

Yet, there may be a ray of hope from Democrat Presidential candidate Andrew Yang.Who Is Andrew Yang?Andrew Yang is an entrepreneur and founder of Venture for America (VFA), a non-profit organization with a mission of:Mobilizing the next generation of entrepreneurs and equipping them with the skills and resources they need to create jobs.Praised by the Obama administration in 2012, Yang was selected as a \u201cChampion of Change,\u201d and later, in 2015, recognized as a \u201cPresidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship.\u201dSomewhat a dark horse in this electoral race, Yang caused a flurry of excitement among the cryptocurrency community last summer. He declared that he accepted bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrency donations for his campaign:HUGE news \u2013 my campaign can now accept Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies! https://t.co/GScyqfZXLY Let\u2019s build the future together. @Steven_McKie @JulianSarokin @yidagao @AdamDraper @mashadrokova @albertwenger @novogratz @ericbahn @RamanFrey @richardtitus\u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYangVFA) July 24, 2018Along with the words:Let\u2019s build the future togetherThis sparked a storm of comments from his followers asking whether that meant that he supported the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies. There were also plenty of enthusiastic statements like:Nothing stops crypto, even Presidential candidates are jumping on!Yang also had to contend with a decent amount of criticism. The usual opposers claiming that untraceable donations would lead to a flow of illicit funds and foreign financing. They even pointed out the damage to the climate from PoW mining. Knowledge of Bitcoin Back to 2013Regardless of the mixed reactions to his news last summer, the 44-year-old Yang of Asian descent could certainly bring the promise of the winds of change in American politics. And his knowledge of Bitcoin goes back at least as far as 2013 when he tweeted about the then price meltdown when the price dropped under $600 USD:I sense the bitcoin price correction will make some Fellows nervous http://t.co/VGCkXqtcLg #takesomeoffthetable\u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYangVFA) December 7, 2013How far this outsider will get in the presidential race and how much he will do to thrust cryptocurrencies front and center if he wins remains to be seen.

Ban on Cryptocurrency Short Selling and Margin TradingThe Canadian Securities Administrators and the IIROC have filed a joint consultation paper called Proposed Framework for Crypto-Asset Trading Platforms on March 14th, 2019, seeking community feedback regarding the direction cryptocurrency regulations should partake.At the very beginning of the paper, the regulators outline their main concerns:Although DLT may provide benefits, global incidents point to crypto assets having heightened risks related to loss and theft as compared to other assets.The framework, if approved, will likely cause a massive turmoil amid cryptocurrency traders, mainly because it intends to strip them off two of the most commonly used trading instruments, namely, short selling and margin trading.To reduce the risks of potentially manipulative or deceptive activities, in the near term, we propose that Platforms not permit dark trading or short selling activities, or extend margin to their participants.Removing short selling and margin trading as instruments on cryptocurrency exchanges would essentially limit traders to only execute regular spot trades.As Bitcoinist reported, Japanese regulators approved legislative amendments to their existing payment services law, limiting the amount of leverage cryptocurrency exchanges may offer their users to two-to-four times their initial deposit.However, it\u2019s worth noting that Japan hasn\u2019t stripped away the possibility to short trade digital assets.QuadrigaCX Aftermath?The proposed framework comes following the scandal with what used to be Canada\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX and the death of its CEO. The deceased was supposedly the only who had the private keys to cold wallets which held $250 million worth of cryptocurrency of customer funds.It seems that the event has made an impression on legislators, as one of their main points of concern regarding cryptocurrency custody solutions is the lack of protection on behalf of the trading platform itself.To the extent that the Platform holds or has control over investors\u2019 assets, a significant risk is that investors\u2019 assets are not sufficiently accounted for or protected by the Platform. As a result, the Platform might not have sufficient crypto assets or cash to satisfy demand or could be vulnerable to theft.Not surprisingly, the proposed regulations take aim at cryptocurrency custody providers, seeking to put them under traditional legislative oversight.\u2026we contemplate that Platforms seeking registration as an investment dealer registration and IIROC membership that plan to provide custody of crypto assets will not only need to satisfy existing custody requirements but will also be expected to meet other yet-to-be-determined standards specific to the custody of crypto assets.What do you think of the proposed regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges in Canada?

Simply put, the higher the hash rate, the more resources it requires to successfully attack Bitcoin.The rise in hash rate also translates into new miners joining the network. With the mining difficulty remaining relatively flat for over a month now, new miners have found it easier to bring their rigs online.Though with the hash power now climbing, the difficulty, a counterblancing feature, will likely increase in the coming days.Market Optimism Making a Comeback?The latest uptick may prove to be significant as this means that the downward trend in hash rate may now be definitevly broken along with the previous spike of 50,000,000 TH/s seen in early February.Overall, network security is at its highest since the beginning of November 2018, marking a 4-month high. It\u2019s also getting closer to the all-time record high of roughly 62,000,000 TH/s set in August 2018.The hash rate is also an important metric for guaging the sentiment of miners who secure the Bitcoin network. This is because miners must be confident in the network\u2019s future in order to invest the capital to fund operations.Casa CTO, Jameson Lopp, for example, believes that miners speculate on the future price of bitcoin. Therefore, it is possible that miners are beginning to return as the BTC price is currently experiencing a four-week winning streak.\u201cHashrate follows price,\u201d he explains. \u201cSome folks believe price follows hashrate, possibly because hashrate doesn\u2019t simply track ~spot~ price, but rather tracks some ~speculative~ future price. Miners are speculators too!\u201dHashrate follows price.

Miners are speculators too!\u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) June 23, 2018Mining \u2018Death Spiral\u2019 CancelledThe recovery of the hash rate also suggests that unfounded fears of a \u2018mining death-spiral\u2019 as price plummeted late last year may now be put to rest.When price was dropping throughout 2018, the least efficient miners were likely turning off their rigs to avoid operating at a loss, dropping the overall hash rate. However, Bitcoin\u2019s (lagging) difficulty adjustment feature made sure that other miner made profit.\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of the difficulty adjustment. Every miner that is turned off increases the profitability of remaining miners,\u201d entrepreneur Matt Odell stated in November, criticizing mainstream news over their \u2018death spiral\u2019 headlines.But now, more miners coming online to push up the hashrate. This suggests that they are currently in profit at current spot price and/or expect the market to grow in the future.Worth noting, today\u2019s Bitcoin hash rate is over four times greater than when BTC price hit its record high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017.Does an increasing hashrate suggest price will follow?

As reported by TechCrunch, Vectordash is looking to allow people with underpowered rigs not meant for gaming \u2014 such as Apple computers \u2014 to experience quality PC gaming with the help of individuals willing to rent their spare power for cloud rendering. This means that, in theory, even those with a Macbook Air could game at 4K resolution and 60 frames-per-second, given their internet bandwidth is capable of handling that amount of data.If this sounds too good to be true, it\u2019s not. Cloud rendering itself is nothing particularly new, so this idea is far from half-baked. Sony launched a cloud rendering service in PlayStation Now years ago \u2014 though it never really took off. Nevertheless, the company proved that cloud rendering is a viable option for gaming going forward.Vectordash\u2019s service will apparently run users $28 per month for cloud rendering capabilities. On the other side of the deal, GPU renters stand to make about $0.60 per day \u2014 which isn\u2019t life-changing money for anyone who has the dough to throw at high-powered GPUs. However, the ability to put less-than-profitable meant-for-mining GPUs to work for another reason may help those who have been beaten down by both a bear market and dramatically more powerful ASIC mining rigs.The key for Vectordash, of course, is offering payments for renters that are competitively priced with cryptocurrency mining returns \u2014 which shouldn\u2019t be too difficult, given that GPU mining returns are currently negligible.What do you think about Vectordash and cloud rendering PC games?

Instead, it\u2019s companies that deal in cryptocurrencies that require \u201cthoughtful\u201d oversight, particularly in light of the recent QuadrigaCX fiasco.Winklevoss: Crypto Doesn\u2019t Need Rules, But\u2026It\u2019s no secret that the Winklevoss twins have been championing the \u2018sanitization\u2018 of cryptocurrency. With their \u201cfully regulated\u201d Gemini exchange, their goal is to change the Wild West image of the fledgling industry that\u2019s been plagued by exchange hacks, scams and fraudulent security offerings.At the same time, it came as no surprise that their \u2018Crypto needs rules\u2019 billboard campaign was heavily criticized by Bitcoin users, in particular.This is because running your own full node is the only way to enforce the rules \u2013 the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. In fact, Bitcoin was specifically designed so people can transact without having to trust anyone \u2013 even in the presence of bad actors.\u201cSome have wondered why Gemini believes the Revolution Needs Rules,\u201d Cameron Winklevoss responded last week.Answer: Crypto doesn\u2019t need rules, but the companies built on top of it do.He cited an excerpt from court-appointed monitor\u2019s third report filed in Nova Scotia Supreme Court on the matter of the defunct QuadrigaCX exchange that lost millions in customer funds.Some have wondered why @Gemini believes the Revolution Needs Rules.

Gox etc. from happening again. Cameron added:Every incident in crypto to date has been/would have been PREVENTABLE w/ proper rules and thoughtful regulation.Incidents a \u2018Human Problem, Not a Crypto Problem\u2019Referencing QuadrigaCX\u2019s failure and the Mt. Gox fiasco, Cameron Winklevoss outlined the problems still plaguing the new industry at the recently held South by Southwest conference held in Austin, Texas:There are a lot of carcasses on the road of crypto that we\u2019ve seen and learned from. At the end of the day it\u2019s really a trust problem. You need some kind of regulation to promote positive outcomes.Luckily, the Winklevoss twins say they are seeing massive growth in just three years. Speaking to an audience of over 700 attendees in a talk titled \u201cTo help build the future of money,\u201d Cameron and Tyler noted how the industry is maturing. \u201cAs crypto has grown up a lot so has Gemini. We\u2019ve grown from 25 to 200 employees\u2026In 2016 crypto was niche \u2014 today it is something \u2014 tomorrow it will be everything,\u201d wrote Cameron Winklevoss in a blog post, recapping the event. Bitcoin Will Pass $7 Trillion Gold Market Cap, Winklevoss Twins SayThis rapid growth means that the stakes are becoming ever higher with the latest QuadrigaCX fiasco as a prime example.Therefore, it\u2019s time to \u201cthoughtfully\u201d regulate the industry, according to the Winklevii. Reiterating that \u201cTrust is our product,\u201d Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss believe that even trustless cryptocurrencies will still require dealing with trusted third parties as many people will still trade their financial sovereignty for convenience.Some argue that the protocols themselves have enough \u201crules.\u201d We agree, but protocols only govern the movement of funds inside systems; they don\u2019t provide controls or oversight for the entrepreneurs and companies that build on top of them. Every crypto incident to date has been a company (or human) problem, not a crypto problem.In other words, the twins do not see the advent of digital gold as the end of vaults, which the Winklevii are more than happy to supply.Do you agree with the Winklevoss twins that crypto companies still need rules?

The news comes via an official statement on Gatecoin\u2019s website.As detailed by the company, Gatecoin ran into trouble with its banking partners in September 2018, which forced the lesser-known exchange to commence a working relationship with a payment service provider (PSP). Said provider is apparently fully-compliant with French regulations. However, Gatecoin blames the PSP for failing \u201cto process most of the transfers in a timely manner.\u201d States the exchange:[This] in turn almost paralyzed our operation for many months and caused substantial loss on our side.Things apparently got worse when Gatecoin decided to replace the problematic PSP with \u201cmore reliable alternatives.\u201d The prior PSP allegedly retained a significant portion of the exchange\u2019s funds. Legal action apparently had little effect on recovering the funds \u2014 which seems a little suspect. Explains the statement:After months spent trying to recover those funds, we commenced legal action against that PSP but were advised that it is unlikely that we would be able to recover the funds from them in full.This financial difficulty, undoubtedly paired with the continued bear market, has forced Gatecoin to close up shop. The company was ordered to wind up by a court on March 13, 2019, and a provisional liquidator has been put in control. All operations must be ceased immediately. \u201cPlease rest assured that we will assist the liquidation process in order to expedite the realization and redistribution of our assets to the creditors,\u201d the statement claims.Gatecoin now joins the growing list of failed exchanges and bear market fatalities as the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry continues to flush out the waste and separate the wheat from the chaff.What do you think of Gatecoin\u2019s closure?

However, co-founder and CEO of Block.one, Brendan Blumer, believes that Bitcoin may never need to scale moving forward because it\u2019s already well on its way to becoming \u2018digital gold.\u2019\u201cOver the next two decades, Bitcoin will replace gold as the leading commodity to store value,\u201d writes Blumer. #Bitcoin won\u2019t scale because it doesn\u2019t need to\u2014 BrendanBlumer (@BrendanBlumer) March 17, 2019The executive, whose Block.one startup raised a record $4 billion last year selling EOS tokens, believes that most economic activity will not take place on the Bitcoin blockchain itself. Instead, most everyday transactions will move to applications that will be built on top of the Bitcoin base layer.\u201cMost of the activity will flow to scalable layer-two solutions, but Bitcoin\u2019s awareness and liquidity will continue to compound,\u201d he explains. One such example today is the Lightning Network (LN) that has grown exponentially over the past year. With usability noticeably improving, this second-layer application is beginning to deliver on its promise of transacting bitcoin instantly at fractions of a penny.Therefore, the Bitcoin blockchain may not need any further on-chain scaling at all, though \u201cbig fees for settlement-layer transactions\u201d are to be expected, according to Blumer.Blumer\u2019s prediction echoes last year\u2019s report from Microsoft, which concluded that layer-two scaling solutions, such as LN are superior to scaling on-chain by increasing the block size limit.While some blockchain communities have increased on-chain transaction capacity (e.g. blocksize increases), this approach generally degrades the decentralized state of the network and cannot reach the millions of transactions per second the system would generate at world-scale.Bitcoin is \u2018Gold 2.0\u2019At the same time, the Block.one CEO isn\u2019t the only one who thinks Bitcoin may become the global \u2018gold 2.0\u2019 base layer for storing value.Earlier this year, the Winklevoss twins stated that they believe \u201cbitcoin is better at being gold than gold.\u201dWall Street veteran and host of the Keiser Report, Max Keiser, also predicts Bitcoin will become the new world reserve currency and store of value calling it \u201cpeer-to-peer gold.\u201d\u201cTo really get Satoshi\u2019s vision, it\u2019s peer-to-peer gold\u2026 that\u2019s what Bitcoin accomplishes, that\u2019s what Bitcoin is, fight me on this, go ahead, but you\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said last month, responding to a World Gold Council report that argues Bitcoin cannot never become a substitute for the yellow metal.More recently, famous investor and goldbug Marc Faber known as \u2018Dr. Doom\u2019 has also put his skin in the game by buying into Bitcoin for the first time.\u201cI bought Bitcoin for the first time ten days ago,\u201d he said.It\u2019s not certain, but possible, that Bitcoin will be the standard for money transfers.Nevertheless, considerable efforts continue to optimize the Bitcoin network and boost throughput capacity.

For Tom Lee of Fundstrat, startups in the crypto and blockchain space appear to be pivoting away from token sales towards equity raises.If Lee\u2019s summation is indeed accurate then it could signal the emergence of maturity in the market, with projects looking towards utility and value creation rather than the \u2018get rich quick\u2019 ICO trend.Tom LeeSpeaking to CNBC last week as part of a series of forecasts and market outlooks for cryptocurrencies in general, Lee opined:We believe 2019 is a year of repair, setting up for a strong recovery in crypto prices broadly in 2020. Any improvements in supply/demand dynamics is positive for prices and hence, the slowdown in ICO funding is a net positive. Sentiment is also quite muted, which is positive.Cryptocurrency PurgeThe lack of utility and value creation continues to be a major criticism of many ICO projects. While Bitcoin continues to find greater adoption across the world, many ICO tokens have failed to make any significant impact on the market.The reason for this failure is usually easy to deduce \u2013 it takes more than merely grafting a token to an existing business model and expecting it to become the \u201cnext Bitcoin.\u201d Thus, commentators like Barry Silbert, CEO of Digital Currency Group even believe that most tokens will go to zero.Silbert\u2019s opinion echoes those of Bitwise executive, Matt Hougan who expects 95 percent of cryptocurrencies to die out in a \u2018purge\u2019 akin to that of the dot-com era. If these predictions are correct, then the continued ICO fundraising decline may be a precursor to the start of the cryptocurrency purge.What do you think are the factors responsible for the decline in ICO fundraising since the turn of the year?

And it isn\u2019t pretty.Centralized Cashless Payments in ChinaChina is known for its high rate of technology adoption. Of the 2 billion or so smartphones around the world, two-thirds of them are in China.Unlike most users in the West, Chinese smartphones are particularly popular for making instant cashless payments. Just about everyone accepts mobile payments, from small street vendors to homeless people.Up until now, Chinese using WeChat Pay to make a purchase was completely at their will. But the Shenzhen traffic police are about to instantly extract fines from people\u2019s WeChat accounts if they\u2019re caught jaywalking. Better than that? They\u2019re using facial recognition technology to catch offenders and remove the fines automatically, no questions asked.Facial Recognition to \u2018Name and Shame\u2019 Is Not EnoughIn Shenzhen, pedestrians who violate road rules are already named and shamed on giant LED screens. Traffic police use CCTV cameras backed by AI to single out jaywalkers. Their faces are also registered on a government website.AI-enabled cameras are nothing new in China\u2019s most progressive city. The technology was put in place in April 2018 and since then, almost 14,000 jaywalkers have had their faces plastered across the screen at a busy junction in the Futian district.The Chinese authorities, it seems, really don\u2019t want you crossing the road outside of a designated pedestrian area.According to Wang Jun, Director of Marketing Solutions at AI firm Intellifusion, quoted in South China Morning Post, however, naming and shaming is not enough.Jaywalking has always been an issue in China and can hardly be resolved just by imposing fines or taking photos of the offenders\u2026 But a combination of technology and psychology\u2026 can greatly reduce instances of jaywalking and will prevent repeat offenses.So, the Chinese traffic police will soon use a combination of facial recognition technology and instant fines by text.Despite the margin for error (last year, a facial recognition system mistook a face on a bus for a jaywalker), the new system is moving ahead.Push vs Pull Payments: Centralization vs DecentralizationSince the naming and shaming campaign began, the number of repeat offenders has reduced. Although Wang believes the only incentive strong enough to stop jaywalking completely is to hit people directly in their pockets.Intellifusion is currently in talks with popular Chinese social media platforms WeChat and Weibo. Not only will the jaywalker be notified by text, but their account will be debited some 20 minutes later. Their credit rating will also be affected if they pass a certain limit and violate the rules too many times.If it sounds like a scene from an Orwellian society, that\u2019s because this is exactly what this is. Big Brother China is showing the world where the future of centralized cashless payments is headed. And it isn\u2019t pretty.By going ahead and taking funds from violators\u2019 accounts, they impose a \u2018pull payment\u2019 strategy, whereby the supplier simply takes the money from the account. Now, contrast this to a decentralized financial system like Bitcoin, in which account holders send the funds (with their private key) and payments are \u2018pushed\u2019 onto the network.China Has Control Over Your Financial SovereigntyIt\u2019s been clear to the Chinese people for some time now that the authorities are watching them. But with this new initiative, the government will have access to pull payments from its citizens\u2019 accounts, effectively controlling their financial sovereignty.It\u2019s not only Shenzhen that\u2019s doing it, either. The Chinese are getting trigger-happy with facial recognition technology, with similar projects in Shanghai and Beijing.What do you think about China\u2019s automatic fines for jaywalking?

According to Bitwise, only 10 exchanges have actual volume\u2026 but it\u2019s not all bad news for the bitcoin market.95% of Bitcoin Exchange Volume is FakeClaims of wash trading and fake volumes are nothing new. Groups like the Blockchain Transparency Institute have been publishing ever more detailed reports on the issue. But the suggestion that 95% of the volume is fake marks a new high (or low) point. The main reason for an exchange to fake volume is to inflate the listing fees it can charge.1/ New Research from us @BitwiseInvest.As part of 226 slides presented to the SEC on our ETF filing, we did a first-of-its-kind analysis of *order book data* from all 81 exchanges reporting >$1M in BTC volume on CMC.TLDR: 95% of reported volume is fake but LOTS of good news! pic.twitter.com/TuXLlDCRyP\u2014 Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) March 22, 2019According to the research, only ten exchanges reporting over $1 million average daily volume on CoinMarketCap are genuine. These are Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, Bitstamp, Coinbase, BitFlyer, Gemini, itBit, Bittrex, and Poloniex. The report excluded Korean exchanges, and Cex.io passed the test but reports lower than $1M volume.Many Exchanges Don\u2019t Even Try to Cover ItThe report presentation gives a good comparison showing how to tell a real exchange from a suspicious one. When comparing the two side by side, some exchanges fakery appears blindingly obvious.On a genuine exchange trade distribution between buying and selling will be random; amounts will be both large and small, with a significant number of \u2019round numbers.\u2019 Volumes will fluctuate over time, with busier and quieter periods; and the spread (difference in buy and sell price) will typically be just a few cents.On the other hand, suspicious exchanges often have trades, which come in pairs (one buy and one sell). It is very unlikely that real trades would occur in such a pattern. Trades are for similar amounts, with no very small trades, and no \u2019round number\u2019 trades, despite a human preference for round numbers.Suspicious exchanges are likely to have a higher spread, despite supposedly massive volume. Volumes will remain roughly constant per time period, or may perhaps drop out completely for hours or even days.This Smaller Market is \u2018More Orderly\u2019 for Bitcoin ETFSo Bitwise promised us some good news. But, in reality, it\u2019s more like just good news for them. Because this research was actually presented to the SEC in support of Bitwise\u2019s Bitcoin ETF application. So the good news is that despite an alleged 95% of the volume being fake:The real market for bitcoin is significantly smaller, more orderly, and more regulated than is commonly understood.Well whoopee-doo! The bad news, of course, is that now dodgy exchanges know how to tweak their bots to avoid detection.Will this research from Bitwise have a positive effect on their Bitcoin ETF application?

His social support scheme, funding for which is currently a hot topic of debate on social media, he has called the \u2018Freedom Dividend.\u2019\u201cUniversal Basic Income is a policy where every member of a society, in this case, every American citizen, gets enough money to meet his or her basic needs,\u201d Yang explained in a promotional video uploaded on CNBC March 21.\u201cSo in my plan, the Freedom Dividend, every American adult turning age 18 would receive $1000 a month free and clear to do whatever you want.\u201dThe scheme would naturally involve increased money printing, if not quantitative easing (QE) on steroids. This would inflate the money supply even further and likely cause prices to rise.In turn, bitcoin price would likely rise as well since its supply is hard-capped at 21 million. According to Gresham\u2019s Law, bad money would drive out good money, which in this case would be bitcoin that people would be incentivized to hold as a store value against a constantly depreciating currency like the US dollar.Yang Accepts BitcoinAs Bitcoinist reported this week, Yang has a history of embracing innovative economic concepts which have until now broadly remained confined to niche areas of society. Among those, in addition to UBI, is cryptocurrency as a mainstream financing tool. Yang has publicly mentioned Bitcoin and his affinity for it since at least 2013, while last year he began accepting cryptocurrency payments for his presidential campaign. Unsurprisingly, then, the UBI proposal drew wide praise from the cryptocurrency community on social media.I\u2019m joining the #YangGang. This guy is fantastic. https://t.co/T3v3w8XTtb\u2014 Max Keiser, tweet poet. (@maxkeiser) March 22, 2019Discussing how he would fund the Freedom Dividend, Yang gained the support of Max Keiser, a serial Bitcoin bull who remains highly critical of US debt-driven economics. Yang said he would, in fact, increase gross national debt at first, but reap back benefits in added productivity and tax restructuring. \u201cIt would not cause much inflation, would be good for business, and help millions of Americans towards better opportunities in life,\u201d he wrote on Twitter Thursday. Good companies invest in their people. It is time we do the same.Other reactions to the UBI scheme came from figures such as trading guru known as Vortex, who praised the argument as being \u201cbased on logic and data.\u201dDetractors criticized the mounting debt problem, which has become a sore issue for many after the overall US debt pile frequently rose to new record heights.\u201cThe things I\u2019m recommending are not pie-in-the-sky or utopian at all; they\u2019re actually things we should have done years ago,\u201d Yang concluded in the promotional video. Finland\u2019s Modest BenefitsThe presidential hopeful is not the first politician to spotlight UBI. Elsewhere, Finland concluded a trial of a real-life UBI scheme last month, which nonetheless showed only modest benefits for the economy. The trial involved 2000 randomly-chosen citizens who each received \u20ac560 per month for two years. \u201cOverall, the number of days in employment, and total labor market earnings, were no higher for those receiving the basic income than for those in the control group,\u201d a report into the results by The Conversation summarized.Yang has not explained whether or not the Freedom Dividend could involve cryptocurrency.What do you think about Andrew Yang\u2019s UBI concept?

I studied in Yeshiva Ohr Tmimim in Kfar Chabad, Israel and received my Rabbincal ordination. I am not a pulpit rabbi with a community. I am a teacher; I teach Jewish subjects in a Jewish day school, I\u2019m on the board of a synagogue and I organize many of our community services and events.How and when did you get introduced to Bitcoin?I was always interested in Austrian economics and libertarian philosophy. In mid-2017 my brother told me that he had bought some bitcoin and that the price was rising quickly, so I started looking into it. I watched several hours of Andreas Antonopoulos videos and did some other reading online and quickly became very excited about Bitcoin and decided to buy some.Is Bitcoin kosher?Kosher means \u201cpermissible\u201d or \u201cacceptable\u201d. Bitcoin is a tool, and with all tools, it can be used for good or bad. It depends who is using it and what they are using it for.If you use Bitcoin without any form of theft or harm to others then Bitcoin is kosher.Jewish law also requires that we follow the laws of the land, so to be kosher, a person should use Bitcoin in accordance with the laws of their state and country, including paying taxes.How does Bitcoin fit in with the Jewish religion, ethics, and customs?Judaism considers money to be extremely important, compared to one\u2019s very life. We are commanded to protect our money and do no harm to anyone else\u2019s. That being the case, having hard stable money is a desirable thing. In Jewish history and tradition, money was always gold and silver. There are even several rituals that we do to this day specifically with silver coins and gold.There are many Jewish legal questions about the process of Bitcoin transactions, mining, etc. rabbinic leaders will be addressing more of these questions as digital currency becomes more prevalent and widespread.You\u2019ve also drawn parallels between Judaism and Bitcoin saying \u201cJudaism insists that all members become full nodes\u201d and that Rabbi\u2019s are like \u2018miners.\u2019 Can you talk a little bit more about this?Judaism is based on the Torah as well as several books of commentary and Jewish law, such as the Talmud. In Judaism, each person is required not just to blindly follow the instructions of the leaders, but rather to purchase their own copies of the books and study them constantly to become knowledgable in all aspects of Jewish law and history. This allows a person to follow Jewish law in every situation of their life because they have the knowledge themselves.This is similar to running a full node, which archives the entire history of the blockchain and verifies every transaction and block.I compare the great rabbis, the rabbinic leaders of each generation to miners because they are the greatest experts in all of previous Jewish history and law and they address new situations and write new books which link the past to the present and future.Each generation is a new block that is produced by the rabbis/miners and then validated and accepted by the entire community as part of the same tradition and following the rules of Judaism going back to Moses.Why did you decide to release a children\u2019s book called Bitcoin Money? How did you get the idea?I have young children and I talk to them a lot about Bitcoin. I try to explain both the technical and economic ideas in simple terms. I also have a presentation called \u201cBitcoin & Judaism\u201d in which I explore the history of money.I took those ideas and condensed them down and simplified them into a book which is not only for children, but explains the simple economic idea of Bitcoin as hard money to both children and adults. The book and my ideas are heavily influenced by The Bitcoin Standard, by Saifedean Ammous.I want people to give this book as a gift to friends as an introduction explainer about \u201cwhy Bitcoin?\u201dHow does it explain Bitcoin to kids? Can you provide some examples from the book?The story of \u201cBitcoin Money\u201d is about a little town called Bitville, where the children start their own businesses offering goods and services to each other. First, they start with barter, then explore different types of money, and eventually get stuck with fiat paper money and inflation.One day a new boy moved to Bitville. He called himself Satoshi, but nobody knew much else about him. Satoshi noticed that the kids in Bitville were not happy about more and more paper money being printed each day.Satoshi thought to himself, \u201cWhat if we could make a new kind of money that is limited in supply like metal money, but it isn\u2019t heavy so everyone can carry it around for themselves without having to trust anybody to keep it in a safe for them?\u201dYou also note that children can understand the concept of hard digital money better than adults who used fiat their whole lives. Can you elaborate on this?Older people who have been using fiat money their entire lives may find it scary to store their wealth in something that is only digital and not government backed. They want something that they are familiar with and feels secure, especially in the United States where the currency is fairly stable compared to the rest of the world.Young people, in general, are used to doing their banking and spending in digital format just because they are more comfortable with the technology. Growing up with everything digital and electronic also makes it easier to rely on digital currency.From an economic perspective, when you explain to a kid that fiat money is just paper that can be printed infinitely, they realize that there isn\u2019t something valuable there.The limited number of 21 million bitcoin is a powerful concept that even a kid can understand.The economic concepts of Bitcoin of good hard money are really simple even for a kid to understand: scarcity, supply, and demand.What is your favorite way to explain Bitcoin to new people? Have you had many \u2018converts\u2019?I think that the limited supply is the most important thing to explain to people. I also explain the idea that when you own Bitcoin, it is truly yours, as opposed to all other forms of digital money. I talk to everybody I know about Bitcoin, most are still skeptics, but a few have shown interest. I haven\u2019t gotten any of my friends to run a full node though yet, so there\u2019s a lot more work to do.Images courtesy of Shutterstock, Twitter (@thebitcoinrabbi )"}

The information comes from a press release, which states that the two companies have signed a memorandum of understanding and have received a license to establish a cryptocurrency exchange in Vietnam.This news comes after the Zug-based KRONN Ventures AG brought together financial committees from Vietnam, Philippines, Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka to form a consortium in late last year. The consortium was formed to construct an international wiring system powered by blockchain technology.The aforementioned press release claims that the Linh Thanh Group and KRONN Ventures are building \u201ca world-class cryptocurrency exchange\u201d \u2014 which may have merit, given Zug\u2019s standing as a leading cryptocurrency and blockchain hotspot in the world. KRONN has also worked with London\u2019s King\u2019s College on an artificial intelligence research facility.\u201cThe industry expectation is that by combining Linh Thanh Group\u2019s massive distribution network, which is the largest in Vietnam, with the world-class technology of KRONN Ventures, the impact will be widely felt not only in Vietnam but also in other surrounding Asian countries,\u201d states the press release \u2014 though we\u2019re not confident the press release is capable of speaking for the entire blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.The move from Linh Thanh Group and KRONN Ventures is one likely driven by the desire of developing countries in Asia to not fall behind once the cryptocurrency market finishes correcting and commences on another positive trajectory \u2014 which is more likely to happen than not, given the behind-the-scenes development taking place on an industry level while coin prices fall and worthless tokens find themselves removed from the market. It is also a move that hopes to reverse the worrying trend in the region of regulators casting unfavorable eyes on the industry.What do you think about Linh Thanh Group and KRONN Ventures teaming up to launch Vietnam\u2019s first authorized cryptocurrency exchange?

We take a closer look at the price action and what lies ahead for the week.WEEKLY CHARTThe Weekly chart shows that going into the week, Bitcoin price 00 is applying pressure to the 20-week moving average (the center on the Bollinger bands). This has proven too much to overcome in the bear market, with the only two previous breaks during 2018 failing the following week.This is clearly a critical level, with BTC price finding another reason for resistance on top of the $4,000 psychological level. Despite this, bitcoin continues applying pressure to the upside, rather than the downside.The upper and lower bands (being two standard deviations from the 20 WMA) are still rather far apart and suggest that any sizable move would have the scope to take BTC towards either upwards to $5000 or down to $2500.Support in the 200 WMA lies below and will act as a last line of defense should the bulls need to rely upon it. Whether it be the 20 WMA or the 200 WMA, which ultimately breaks in the near term, it will likely result in a fast move.DAILY CHARTThe Daily Chart shows that bitcoin price finished Sunday on a red candle and is currently a doji midway through Monday. The market continues to be trapped in the range between $3850 and $4000, which has been the case for the best part of the last 10 days.The market structure is that of an incomplete inverted head and shoulder pattern, which would complete on a close above $4300. This is also effectively the eve cup of a larger Adam and Eve bottom.Should these bottom patterns play out, a move between $4885 and $5280 becomes the technical target. The volume profile illustrates that a break above $4400 would see a void in price history and a fast move could follow.MARKET SENTIMENTAlthough generally there are reasons to be upbeat and there are signs of it being bullish on social media, the long to short ratio at Bitfinex is almost flat, leaning a slight 1% bullish and the Bitmex Futures contracts are currently trading at a discount against Spot, implying that the market is not (yet) reflecting the upbeat conversation.With the market remaining in a long term bearish position but threatening to break to the upside, the week is likely to be a pivotal one which we will be monitoring closely at Bitcoinist.Trade Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

This time arguing against Central Bank Digital Currencies at the Central Bank of Ireland\u2019s Annual Whitaker Lecture.BIS: Vested Interest In Legacy SystemsAgustin Carstens really doesn\u2019t want anything to upset the status quo. You know, the one in which he\u2019s the head of Bank for International Settlements \u2013 the central bank of central banks. It\u2019s also an organization that makes a fortune if there isn\u2019t an easy and cheap way to make international payments. You know, like, for example, cryptocurrency.The annual lecture celebrates Ken Whitaker, champion of economic reform, and governor of the Irish central bank from 1969-76. With either a complete lack of self-awareness, or a masterful grasp of post-modern irony, Carstens started with a reference.Whitaker, along with other European central bankers, petitioned the BIS to include representation from more countries on its board. According to Agustin:I\u2019m afraid the BIS was not very receptive at the time: it saw any expansion as a slippery slope.Central Banks Can Design Their Own \u2018Cryptos\u2019Carstens then took the audience on a thought experiment, to see what a world with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) might look like (though fiat currencies today are already overwhelmingly digital). The focus was on central bank digital currencies as a cash substitute. He suggests that there is no urgent need for this as \u201cfor most countries, cash is still in high demand,\u201d but banks want to be prepared.Superficially, for the consumer, there would not seem to be much change, other than all payments being electronically. However, a CBDC would not necessarily be anonymous, and unlike cash, it could pay or charge interest.Of course, if a central bank is designing it then it could be anonymous, and it wouldn\u2019t have to pay or charge interest. In fact, if a central entity issues their own cryptocurrency, they can pretty much design it in any way they want. And wasn\u2019t anonymity one of Carsten\u2019s issues with Bitcoin?He then went on to suggest that moving from a two-tier system, whereby customers deal with commercial banks, to a one-tier system, where customer hold accounts directly with the central bank, could cause upheaval and chaos. But again, there is no reason that the central bank should hold customer accounts directly, or that commercial banks should cease to exist.CBDCs Would Boost Bitcoin\u2019s CredibilityEven in the abstract for the speech, the BIS employs a level of disingenuity bordering on straight-up lying. It claims that \u201conly a very few central banks think it is likely that they will issue a CBDC.\u201d But the very same abstract states that \u201cabout 70 percent [of central banks are] either exploring or experimenting with so-called central bank digital currencies.\u201dIn fact, 10 percent of central banks say they are likely to issue a CBDC in the next 6 years, with 5 percent likely within 3 years.

At its fundamental level, Blockchain technology engenders trusts in inherently trustless environments. Protocol blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, GoChain, Steem and xDai have provided a launchpad for developers to work on DApps. DApps are typically open source applications not owned by anyone, immune from downtimes; and that cannot be shut down by a government or its agencies.The rapid proliferation of Decentralized Applications (DApps) powered a bull run in cryptocurrencies in 2017. Right now, there are more than 2000 DApps designed to solve specific market problems across industries such as health, data storage, finance, gaming, and governance.This piece examines why Blockchain is yet to unlock its mass-market momentum despite the proliferation of DApps and how a positive change might be on the horizon.The promise and hype of DAppsWhen Ethereum\u2019s mainnet went live in 2014; the cryptocurrency market went crazy with predictions about how Blockchain technology was set to hit the mass market. The birth of smart contracts was heralded as the end of many traditional industries. Many people also believed that open source projects will start replacing corporations.From a trading price of $1.18 in 2015, Ethereum rose as high as $1,137 in January 2018 and it has booked almost 12,000% gains despite its decline in the last one year. Ethereum could also be credited with triggering the explosion in token sales that were used promote some DApps in 2017-2018 frenzy.Liquid Apps promises true scalability for DAppsEOS is probably the fastest growing DApps platform as it boasts a market cap of more than $2.2B while adding more than 10,000 new accounts every week. EOS has the correct fundamental principles for supporting the next wave for the mass-market adoption of DApps. The problem however is that cracks are starting to appear in EOS\u2019 shiny armor.For starters, DApps needs to be as accessible as possible for Blockchain to attain mainstream adoption. However, the fact that DApps developers must own and use RAM before they can run their DApps on EOS makes it hard to promote DApps for the mass market. More so, the scarcity of RAM is pushing up the price in its price, thereby making it harder for developers to launch.Liquid Apps\u2019 vision is to optimize development on the blockchain by introducing a range of products for building and scaling decentralized applications (DApps). By introducing an innovative DAPP Network that functions as a second layer on the EOS mainnet, LiquidApps aim to fix the RAM scarcity challenge that is preventing EOS from reaching its true potential.LiquidApps also offers a vRAM system designed to be an alternative storage solution to help EOS developers store and retrieve unlimited amounts of data affordably and efficiently. LiquidApps is trying to do for DApps developers what Amazon\u2019s AWS and Google\u2019s GCP is doing for developers through their cloud computing services.DApps have failed to build up the critical mass on the pastInterestingly, despite the strides being made by all the protocol blockchains and the subsequent explosion in the number of DApps; the mass-market adoption of Blockchain still remains elusive. EOS appears to be the most popular DApps platform; yet its top 5 DApps only have a combined 54,304 users in the last 24 hours. The top 5 DApps on Ethereum have 11,893 users over the last 24 hours and the top 5 DApps on Steem only have a combined 16,074 users in the last 24 hours.One of the major reasons DApp\u2019s haven\u2019t gotten mass market traction especially with Ethereum is the scalability challenges of its Blockchain. Ethereum worked great when its network was small, but it couldn\u2019t scale in tandem with its rapid demand; hence, it ended up suffering sluggish transaction speeds. Secondly, Ethereum has is considering a change in its consensus mechanism in other to improve scalability but the options post the great risk of centralization in the network.How EOS surfaced to fix the problems with EthereumEOS also debuted in January 2018, to fix some of the challenges making it difficult for Ethereum to deliver the promise on the mass-market adoption of DApps. For instance, EOS promised fix scalability problem limiting Ethereum by operating a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) which had helped it to score more than 1000 TPS.EOS was also cheaper with zero transaction fees unlike Ethereum where you\u2019ll need to burn ETH (Gas) to execute smart contracts. EOS also offered a better dev experience through C++ of any WebAssembly language unlike Ethereum that required developers to learn Solidity.EOS is struggling to deliver the promiseAt a cursory glance, EOS seemed to have figured out how to unlock the mass-market adoption of DApps with its faster transaction times, zero transaction fees, and simpler programming language. However, in the last several months; there has been a sense of growing discontent in the developer community as the operational costs of launching a DApp and onboarding new users continue to rise.Developers often need to buy a certain amount of EOS worth of RAM; they\u2019ll need to pay EOS for CPU, and they\u2019ll also need to pay for NET. The main cause of discontent is that the price of RAM is not stable. Secondly, there are growing concerns that hackers could exploit a vulnerability to steal the RAM of another user.EOS DApps can be costly for the teams deploying them and many developers are starting to point out that it costs virtually nothing to launch a DApp on Ethereum. However, the fact that EOS is scalable with proven data sets to run 1 million transactions per day suggests that developers will continue to choose EOS over Ethereum, albeit with growing resentment.Therefore, one could reasonably argue EOS will be unstoppable if it overcomes the challenges associated with the rising costs of RAM and CPU.ConclusionIt is somewhat too early to give up on the potential of DApps to bring Blockchain technology to the mass market. DApps helps to take the conversations about Blockchain technology from the speculative sphere of cryptocurrencies to everyday functional use.Furthermore, DApps can provide mainstream users who are averse to cryptocurrencies with a sandbox to interact with crypto as part of a long-term strategy to bring legitimacy for decentralized money in the global economy.The crypto market has been stuck in bear territory for much of the last 15 months, but LiquidApps might be a game changer that will put crypto back on the bull. If LiquidApps succeeds in making it easier for developers to launch DApps on EOS, the trigger for the next bull run in crypto and the mass-market adoption of Blockchain technology might just be around the corner."}

Sold as a solution to all of life\u2019s problems, blockchain offers a ton of legitimate solutions for businesses \u2013 but raises just as many questions.One of those questions, according to Bellmas\u2019, is why legacy financial institutions need blockchain technology to improve their offerings. She believes that traditional banks and the like \u201cdo not necessarily need it and are better off using existing good old databases and technology solutions.\u201dBellmas\u2019 statements come shortly after JPMorgan Chase announced its own in-house cryptocurrency, JPM Coin. International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) also recently launched its blockchain-powered World Wire service, which aims to provide new financial pathways that both clear and settle cross-border payments almost instantaneously.So, yeah \u2026 maybe those good old databases and technology solutions aren\u2019t quite good enough. Still, that news apparently didn\u2019t reach Bellmas, who continued:The reality is a lot of the problems blockchain projects attempt to fix have already been solved by existing technologies. In many cases, a regular database can solve for the problem with more reliability and for much less cost than blockchain.Bellmas failed to note which existing technologies, specifically, remove the need for a trusted third-party when transacting value across borders for virtually non-existent fees and in real-time.What do you think of Bellmas\u2019 statements?

These levels have acted as support since Mid-February when they turned from resistance and into support.WEEKLY CHARTWith only a few hours remaining, the weekly chart shows that bitcoin price is still being capped by the center line of the Bollinger Bands, which is the 20 week moving average.Should BTC manage to hold the mid $3900s, bitcoin will open the final week of March above the 20 WMA will be for the first time of 2019. It is clear to see that a more definitive move is on the brink of occurring with the pinch of the 200 WMA and the 20 WMA being clearly defined on the chart.The weekly MACD will print a fifth green bar on the histogram and continues to trend upwards, but has some way to go before it crosses its zero line and is in bullish territory.BITCOIN SENTIMENTLooking at sentiment in the Bitcoin market, we can see that the Bitcoin September Futures contract at Bitmex is currently trading around $40 below the spot price, meaning that the expectation of the market is that BTC prices will be lower moving forwards.This of course presents an opportunity for the bulls who believe the opposite to be true. So they\u2019ll be able to pick up bitcoin at a discounted rate. But this would be against market expectation and the discount is to be expected in a bear market environment.The Long/Short ratio at Bitfinex has crept higher in contrast to the futures movement, and is now up at 1.18, which has room to manoeuvre higher towards where it usually tops out around 1.5 if there is a break to the upside.The longs and shorts total open interest at Bitfinex is down to 44k BTC \u2013 down from nearly double that in Dec-2019. This implies that there are speculators awaiting the bigger move to commence before taking on any risk in the market, which further supports the idea the next move will be a sharp one.Overall, bitcoin price remains locked in a bear market and is grinding on upwards in an encouraging fashion. But the bulls must take control of the market in the final week of March as the 20 week moving average continues to suppress the price.Trade Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

Binance Launchpad Becomes a LotteryBitcoinist reported earlier this week that Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, hinted for a new model for conducting Binance Launchpad sales which would incentivize Binance Coin users to become \u2018hodlers\u2019.A few short days later, his words appear to have become a reality. Binance Launchpad has announced that the next project will be launched using a lottery-based format, where users will be able to purchase participation tickets.The catch? The number of tickets one would be entitled to will be entirely based on the amount of Binance Coin (BNB) one holds during a 20-day period prior to the event.Users will be able to claim up to a maximum of 5 lottery tickets based on their BNB holdings over the 20 days (represented by X below) leading up to the lottery draw date.New Format Will Have \u2018Trade-Offs\u2019Each ticket will also represent a certain allocation amount which will correspond to each ticket. Users who have claimed lottery tickets are also committing themselves to participate in the sale, should their ticket be drawn.Please note that entering this ticket amount is a commitment to purchase the amount of tokens corresponding to your eventual number of winning tickets.Once the draw is completed, the respective BNB is going to be deducted from the accounts of the winners.Anyone who wants to participate in the token sale would have to hold more than $1500 worth of BNB for 20 days. Considering price fluctuation and volatility, it\u2019s questionable whether the risk is worth it at all.Speaking on the matter of reducing this threshold, Zhao outlined:\u201cReducing it is possible, but would mean lower % chance of winning, and more dissatisfaction after the sale.\u201dFeedback 1, whale issue, can't afford to hold 100 BNB.Reducing it is possible, but would mean lower % chance of winning, and more dissatisfaction after the sale.You should only participate in LaunchPad sales with spare funds, and should have an adequate level at that.\u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) March 24, 2019Binance themselves have outlined the risks associated with this model, saying that \u201cthere are risks and trade-offs in any model.\u201dNot everyone would agree.

Easily.Continuing, Novogratz brushed aside current worries over the fate of institutional players aiming to enter cryptocurrency-related markets. Bakkt, the platform from New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange, will ultimately launch, he said, despite multiple delays and associated lack of clarity. \u201cBakkt continues to get delayed a little bit, but it\u2019s not going to be delayed forever,\u201d he explained. They\u2019re going to be in the game. And there\u2019s lots of other players coming.It\u2019s a perspective which contrasts with the current fate of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which last week suffered a further setback as research revealed more revelations over fake trading volumes on cryptocurrency exchanges.

But comparing it to historic stock market crashes is comparing apples and oranges, argues Ammous. \u201cBitcoin is a completely new animal, different from all before it,\u201d he says. Your old toolbox for analyzing bubbles, currencies, and stocks doesn\u2019t work on [Bitcoin].It is these outdated tools that prevented the likes of Buffet from missing out on one of the best investment opportunities in history. Even the most robust stocks today, such as Amazon (AMZN), have been outperformed by the digital currency, even at today\u2019s $4,000 price. What\u2019s more, is that after every time the bubble popped, it has come back even stronger. In fact, there have been at least five 80+ percent crashes over the past decade. Ammous notes: Bitcoin appreciated to 200,000,000% of its value in nine years, then crashed back down all the way to around a 30,000,000% rise.In other words, had you bought $100 dollars worth of bitcoin in 2009, you would have about $8 million today.Bitcoin \u2018Incomparable\u2019 to History\u2019s Famous BubblesThe picture also looks different when comparing Bitcoin against history\u2019s famous bubbles. It has often been compared to \u2018tulips\u2019 in the media with every drop in bitcoin price. But this comparison is widely inaccurate just like the common misconceptions about Tulipmania as a whole, because BTC price posts a higher low after every crash. \u201cNocoiners\u2019 favorite bubble, Dutch tulips, lasted for just over 2 years in which the price appreciated around 60-fold, then crashed lower than its original price,\u201d explains Ammous. It also goes without saying that while Bitcoin is the world\u2019s first, borderless, decentralized, neutral money that enables anyone to send millions for pennies, the other is a flower. The rate and scale of valuations is another factor making Bitcoin nothing like the 2008 housing bubble, for example, when housing prices tripled in two decades, and then lost around 40 percent within only a few years.The famous housing bubble saw housing prices triple in around 20 years, and then lose around 40% over a few years. pic.twitter.com/jb9qkJjkBX\u2014 Saifedean Ammous (@saifedean) March 24, 2019Then there\u2019s the 1929 stock market bubble that rose six-folds during the Roaring 20s. The subsequent crash saw prices return to their original price. Meanwhile BTC/USD is still ten times greater than its \u2018pre-bubble\u2019 price of around $400 in 2016. Ammous says: Bitcoin is not only incomparable to bubbles, its fast rise is also incomparable to the most successful companies and innovators. As far as I can tell, nothing has ever risen as fast and as much as Bitcoin has risen.Bitcoin Self-Corrects to Suck Up FiatSo how did Bitcoin manage to rise so much and so fast in such a short timespan? The secret lies in its design. Namely, the inelastic supply of 21 million bitcoin \u2013 a number set in (digital) stone, making it the hardest form of money that ever existed.What\u2019s more is that unlike central banks, the supply (mining) of bitcoin is programmed to grow at a predetermined rate (up to 21 million).This makes it the most predictable asset that ever existed. Not only does everyone know how many bitcoins will exist 10 or even 100 years from now, but this data is also transparent and verifiable.But Ammous notes another important feature that plays an important role in Bitcoin economics: the mining difficulty adjustment.\u201cMy explanation for this rise is that bitcoin\u2019s difficulty adjustment makes it a truly unique monetary asset built to rise fast,\u201d he says. As covered by Bitcoinist, the difficulty adjustment acts as a counterbalance to fluctuations in Bitcoin hash rate or computing power of the network that can with the spot price.Ammous notes that the difference between Bitcoin and traditional money is that the latter is linear, resulting in boom and bust cycles. The former, however, is a positive feedback loop that strengthens the network over time even with erratic price swings.This makes Bitcoin a completely unique as it does not behave like a traditional asset whose production depends on supply and demand.It\u2019s the world\u2019s first self-correcting asset that keeps the most efficient miners profitable regardless of market conditions while siphoning off more and more fiat money by design.Simply put, Bitcoin is not the bubble, it\u2019s the pin.Do you agree that BTC is not like other historic famous bubbles?

Specifically, FATF has admittedly been working on an Interpretive Note to Recommendation 15, which defines how the FATF standards apply to activities or operations involving virtual assets. As has been the case for quite some time, the discussion is firmly centered on the idea that cryptocurrencies are used for money laundering and terrorist financing \u2014 despite the fact that many, like Bitcoin (BTC), feature a distributed public ledger that allows skilled investigators to trace immutable transactions that cannot be changed, altered, or deleted.The Interpretive Note states that countries should define virtual assets as \u201cproperty,\u201d \u201cproceeds,\u201d \u201cfunds\u201d, \u201cfunds or other assets,\u201d or other \u201ccorresponding value.\u201d As such, \u201ccountries should identify, assess, and understand the money laundering and terrorist financing risks emerging from virtual asset activities.\u201dVirtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), according to FATF, should be appropriately regulated and monitored. (Or, in another word, controlled.) \u201cCountries should ensure that beneficiary VASPs obtain and hold required originator information and required and accurate beneficiary information on virtual asset transfers, and make it available on request to appropriate authorities,\u201d states the Interpretive Note, while also stating that, \u201cCountries should ensure that there is a range of effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, whether criminal, civil or administrative, available to deal with VASPs that fail to comply with AML/CFT requirements.\u201dIn short, a prominent financial regulator unsurprisingly wants cryptocurrencies \u2014 which pose a significant threat to legacy financial institutions, central banks, the status quo, and those who aren\u2019t particularly fond of individual financial freedom \u2014 to be strictly regulated and monitored.Who would have thought?What do you think about The Financial Action Task Force\u2019s directions regarding virtual assets?

The report actually discusses the regulation of cryptocurrency intermediaries, which, as recently noted by the Winklevii, is an altogether different thing.Anyway, the Brookings report suggests that better regulation of crypto-companies will:benefit crypto investors, further the development of new technologies, curtail the use of crypto-assets used for illicit payments, and reduce the risk of cyber attacks.In which case we should surely all be calling for it!The Case For The ProsecutionAgain, the report tries to pin this on Bitcoin, claiming that it does not provide the \u2018trustless\u2019 environment it promised. It says crypto-assets \u2018created\u2019 new financial intermediaries that are less accountable than the big banks.Not entirely true. A fledgling industry sprung up around crypto-assets, at a time when regulators didn\u2019t want to touch it. That\u2019s hardly the fault of Bitcoin, which simply provides a trustless way to transact in peer-to-peer fashion.Some of the players in this new industry have taken advantage of the regulatory vacuum. There are bad players who don\u2019t record assets on the blockchain, who manipulate markets, and who trade against their customers. Which of course, has never happened in the \u2018regulated\u2019 banking industry.The report also claims that inadequate regulatory oversight with respect to cybersecurity leads to hacks. Which may be true, but then it rolls out the old dark-web argument, which isn\u2019t, and states that:Crypto-assets are used increasingly to avoid government sponsored sanctionsLike those in Venezuela? Well that puts a whole new angle on those poor, starving, rule-breakers!SEC? CFTC? WTF?The report claims that \u201cNew crypto exchanges and trading platforms are not subject to the traditional standards required of securities and derivatives market intermediaries.\u201dHowever it follows that up by saying, \u201cThe SEC has jurisdiction over crypto-assets deemed securities,\u201d and \u201cDerivatives based on crypto-assets are subject to CFTC regulation\u2026 as are the platforms that trade such derivatives.\u201dSo the Securities and Exchange Commission has jurisdiction over crypto-assets deemed securities, which is almost all of them (according to the SEC)? And the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has jurisdiction over any platform which trades derivatives such as futures or swaps?So the gap is essentially\u2026 just the cash market for buying and selling bitcoin? The report\u2019s author, Timothy G. Massad, recommends that no new regulatory agency is needed. Instead, the SEC should regulate this\u2026 or failing that, the CFTC.The State Of Independence Shall BeThe very first page of the report proper, see\u2019s Massad make a clear \u2018Statement of Independence\u2019.The author did not receive any financial support from any firm or person for this article or from any firm or person with a financial or political interest in this article. They are currently not an officer, director, or board member of any organization with an interest in this article.Hmmmm\u2026 Not currently, no. But he did serve as chairman of the CFTC under the Obama administration. And would perhaps be in line for a similar role the next time there is a Democrat in The White House?Massad is also the author of the report on Brookings website, announcing the article, in which he repeatedly refers to himself in the third person. Surely they could have found somebody else to write the article? It\u2019s all a bit self-promotional and slightly schizophrenic-feeling.Knowing this, it seems likely that Massad has also had a hand in editing his own Wikipedia page. Not that there is anything wrong with this, but it is hard to think that an independent observer would see fit to note:Massad is an accomplished expert cook\u2026 He is known at Treasury for running a baking contest among his staff.That\u2019s not to say that Massad is wrong in suggesting that some regulation of businesses that handle cryptocurrency would be beneficial, he just goes about it all in a rather disingenuous fashion.Do you agree with the Brookings report that the SEC should regulate cryptocurrencies?

The exact same service, however, already existed for over year. Binance Sets Foot in AustraliaThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Binance, has launched a cash-to-crypto platform in Australia, called Binance Lite Australia.The service allows users to purchase Bitcoin with cash through a network of over 1,300 Newsagents stores across the country.Per the release, the service currently only allows users to buy bitcoin using Australian Dollars (AUD), but it plans to support more fiat purchasing options and other digital currencies in the future.Speaking on the matter was Binance\u2019s CFO, Wei Zhou, who said:Binance Lite Australia further expands digital currency adoption by providing easier ways to buy bitcoin. We are excited to continue to roll out more fiat to crypto gateways around the world to support the growth of our industry. [\u2026] We firmly believe that more adoption will lead to more innovation and more economic opportunities.Some customers have already shared pictures online of their receipts after purchasing BTC using Binance Lite.On the way to work this morning while checking my tatts results I bought some Bitcoin using binance lite Australia. @TravelbyBit @binance #binanceangel pic.twitter.com/FI2gttxQnc\u2014 Damien jones (@Kingdamoj) March 20, 2019Nothing New Under the SunAs it turns out, the service which Binance touts to bring \u201cadoption of cryptocurrency use in Australia\u201d already existed.Bitcoinist reported over a year ago that a local exchange called bitcoin.com.au has enabled Australians to purchase bitcoins at Newsagents shops in Australia.Unlike Binance\u2019s offering, however, bitcoin.com.au also allows users to buy Ethereum. They can also use other payment methods such as online POLi payments, vouchers, electronic funds transfer through BPAY and OTC/ATM cash deposits to any Commonwealth Bank branch. Users are also allowed to sell Bitcoin.Furthermore, it does seem like Binance has taken example from the previous service, as it does require the exact same KYC process, as well as setting the same minimum purchase limits.Moreover, in October 2018, one of Australia\u2019s oldest institutions, Australia Post, announced that its customers will be able to buy bitcoin on participating exchanges using its Digital ID service.Bitcoinist has contacted Binance for comments but did not resceive any response at press time.Prepare to Reveal YourselfIf anonymity is what you\u2019re looking for, however, you might consider other options. Binance Lite Australia, as well as bitcoin.com.au, require users to go through a thorough Know Your Customer (KYC) procedure.Per the FAQ section of the platform, in order to complete the verification process, users are required to submit \u201cup to 1-2\u201d government issued ID document numbers, which may include your Driver\u2019s Licence, Passport, or Medicare card.Moreover, users are also required to confirm their residential address and share their mobile phone numbers.As it also turns out, the platform isn\u2019t that cheap to use as well. Binance Lite Australia will be charging its users a flat fee of 5 percent plus a Goods and Service Tax (GST) on every purchase.For comparison, Coinbase charges credit and debit card buys on its platform a flat 3.99 percent fee.Alternatives ExistLuckily, there are still various alternatives users can use to purchase Bitcoin with cash in Australia without having to reveal their identity.One option is decentralized escrow platform Payfair, where users can purchase Bitcoin with cash without having to go through KYC verification.Another peer-to-peer exchange that Australians can use is HodlHodl. It\u2019s a global P2P cryptocurrency exchange, which has no KYC requirements. LocalBitcoins is also a P2P option. Both of these don\u2019t require you to go through identity verification at the beginning, but their terms of service mention that the platforms \u201cmay\u201d require your ID in certain events.What do you think of Binance\u2019s new platform in Australia?

Two days later, that machine has been removed.First Bitcoin ATM in Dubai Lasted Less Than a WeekJust as Bitcoin ATMs are gaining traction around the world, this week seemed like a giant leap forward for the UAE. However, the operational machine in Dubai hotel and wellness center Rixos Premium Dubai JBR has already been removed.

But for those looking to venture into the world of digital currency without having to undergo KYC or even show an ID Card, this is no longer the path forward.It seems that the authorities weren\u2019t in agreement over the lax AML/KYC proposals of Amhora after all.UPDATE: After a brief run-in with the law enforcement yesterday, we have temporarily put-off the ATM from it's location.

So, watch this space for the first Bitcoin ATM in Dubai\u2013The Sequel.Not Good News for Anonymous Bitcoin BuyersThe removal of the machine should be temporary and, in fact, while it allowed users to buy without ID, they still needed some sort of wallet to send their bitcoins to and an account at an existing exchange to sell them afterward. Amhora was also planning to introduce a sell option a couple of months later in which users would need to show an Emirates ID card or passport.Buy Bitcoin at Just Five Percent CommissionIt\u2019s not entirely clear whether Amhora is (as claimed) fully licensed by the Department of Economic Development or not. However, it certainly will have to be before the Bitcoin ATM returns to its rightful spot.Just like most Lamassu ATMs, this one will be updated with KYC options and charge users a five percent commission on the total purchase. While this may sound steep to regular users who shrink from Coinbase and its high fees, the average Bitcoin ATM charges around 7.5 percent.Anhad Dhingra CEO of Amhora enthused:The commission is very attractive because you can buy bitcoins instantly. Otherwise people have to go through a number of procedures which take a lot of time. At this kiosk, you just insert cash and you get bitcoins instantly. It is possible to purchase bitcoins through banking platforms and debit cards already but since we accept cash, it is very different. He probably wishes he hadn\u2019t spoken so candidly about the ease of which users could buy bitcoin through their machine. But let\u2019s hope in the name of progress that the first Bitcoin ATM in Dubai comes back soon\u2013and is legally compliant.Have you ever bought bitcoin from a BTM?

Something of a habit for Draper, the tie features multiple Bitcoin \u2018logos\u2019 \u2013 or depictions of physical coins \u2013 on a conspicuous purple background. The investor has worn it on multiple occasions, both in public and while speaking to mainstream media. This time, however, the tie appeared to take on a life of its own, with reactions from outside crypto \u2013 from formal media and on social platforms \u2013 honing in on Draper\u2019s choice of attire. So, too, did familiar names such as CoinShares CSO Meltem Demirors, who like many other seemed confused about why Draper had chosen the Theranos spot to showcase Bitcoin.2/ it\u2019s @TimDraper in a bitcoin tie and i feel so conflicted!is it good? is it bad?

Theranos Documentary: Misplaced Plug?Other reactions were less complimentary. Among non-crypto Twitter commentators, Draper\u2019s Bitcoin advocacy immediately tied the cryptocurrency to the shady workings of Theranos, which lost almost all of its once $9 billion value.As an early investor in the company, Draper appeared to gain little sympathy from the commentariat, many of whom implied he was himself less than trustworthy. Previous support of Theranos\u2019 CEO Elizabeth Holmes in 2018 compounded the idea. \u201cI feel that we have taken down another great icon,\u201d he told CNBC in an interview last May about Holmes\u2019 demise, during which he also wore his Bitcoin tie.\u201c\u2026She got bullied into submission.\u201dThe less-than-casual plugs of Bitcoin are not the only times Draper has courted controversy among a wider audience over cryptocurrency. Tezos, the much-hyped project he invested in and publicly advocated, has seen considerable public relations difficulties after infighting and delays left investors with little to show for their holdings of the company\u2019s Tezzies digital tokens.As Bitcoinist reported, the mogul has stood up for Tezos\u2019 founders, Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, defending them against accusations over mismanagement. In August last year, Draper avoided being implicated in a class action lawsuit against Tezos brought by disgruntled investors. Coffee And That $250kMeanwhile, Bitcoin remains a central focus in 2019, with sky-high price predictions seemingly reiterated without a shred of doubt. $250,000, Draper says, should be the Bitcoin price by 2023. Sooner than that, he added in February, \u201ceveryone\u201d will already be using it to buy coffee thanks to Bitcoin\u2019s scaling solutions.Such figures are second only to the likes of John McAfee, who has become a dubious legend in own right after doubling down on his belief Bitcoin would hit $1 million by next year \u2013 with a potentially devastating personal forfeit if he is wrong.

Now there\u2019s an even safer, easier way to store your private keys\u2013the all-new Blockstream Green Wallet for iOS and Android.Blockstream Releases Green WalletRebranded from the GreenAddress Bitcoin mobile wallet, this all-new version promises to offer a more seamless UX and heightened security. It\u2019s arguably one of the safest, sleekest, and most convenient mobile wallets for storing and tracking Bitcoin transactions.Like its predecessor, this wallet uses 2-of-2 multisig by default. Perhaps one of it\u2019s most impressive features, though, is that the Blockstream Green keeps one key on your device and the other on the company\u2019s servers. This means that if you lose your mobile device or it gets stolen, no one can get their hands on your funds.There\u2019s also a host of 2FA methods available within the app from Google Authenticator to email, phone call, or SMS, depending on your preference.According to the company post, there are \u201ctoo many features\u201d to mention. However, it reassures current users that:We\u2019ve retained the same multisig security that our existing users know and love, while packing in a whole host of advanced features that should get our power users excited.Support for Trezor and LedgerFor those of you used to using the Trezor One or the Ledger Nano S, the good news is the Blockstream Green wallet works like a charm with both. If you\u2019ve already ordered a Ledger Nano X, you\u2019ll have to wait a little longer until the Green is compatible. The company is currently working on support for later models.Developed by original cypherpunk and Hashcash inventor Adam Back (one of the most respected names in the space), you don\u2019t need to undergo KYC to use this wallet. In fact, all you need is an email address for wallet recovery purposes only. Let\u2019s be clear. If you\u2019re looking to store and trade a host of altcoins, this isn\u2019t the wallet for you. But if you\u2019re looking for the best in cryptographic security for your Bitcoin, it doesn\u2019t get much better than this.According to Back:IMO using @Ledger or @Trezor hardware wallet with @Blockstream green on Android plus multsig 2FA (Google auth with offline device) & the option of cross-verifying with your own fullnode over Tor is probably the most secure self-contained portable Bitcoin solution available today.\u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) March 20, 2019As a cypherpunk, cryptographer, and pioneering Bitcoin miner whose technology is still used today, you couldn\u2019t ask for a more qualified person to design your wallet security.Back\u2019s creation Blockstream is a pioneer in the industry with the mission of \u201ccreating the financial infrastructure of the future\u201d\u2013all based on the most secure blockchain there is\u2013Bitcoin.Will you be trying Green Wallet?

Let\u2019s take a closer look at the price action to see it there is any sign that this time the price level can be maintained.DAILY CHARTThe Daily Bitcoin price chart clearly shows that bitcoin price 00 is well underway with its fourth attempt to break $4k since the December 2018 lows. The market posture remains in that of a bottom pattern with an Adam and Eve and an inverse head and shoulders within the Eve Cup.Should these classical charting patterns play out, it would imply a move towards a $5,000 bitcoin price would be on the cards. However volume remains low and this multi-month pattern is taking its time to grind out.The MACD is crossed bullish with its signal line and remains in bullish territory, but is generally quite flat, which is also the case with the volume.4-HOUR CHARTThe 4-hour chart shows that despite the daily close being above $4k, the previous resistance found at $4040 last week, remains an issue for the bulls. The task at hand is to go some way to confirm the move, and turn previous resistance at $4000 into support.Should this occur and BTC begins to challenge $4200 to break the yearly highs, new buyers may start entering the market. This may also push out bearish positioned traders who will look to exit.The MACD at the time of writing shows that the bulls are starting to look somewhat tired and significant buyers failed to step in at the start of the EU session.Looking at the orderbook, we can see that sizable sell orders remain on the books, acting as a hurdle of liquidity suppressing the BTC price, which the bulls need to overcome. There are signs that the bulls are starting to backfill orders at $4000, however, which will be necessary to sustain price at these levels.Failure to do so amidst low volume will potentially mean that the bears will step in and push the market back down to retest last week\u2019s lows of $3850.WEEKLY CHARTThe Weekly chart shows bitcoin is on its fifth consecutive weekly green candle and is notably mid break of the 20-week moving average (WMA), which is the center of the Bollinger bands. This would be significant as it has previously acted as resistance.The upper band of the Bollinger bands, which is two standard deviations from the center line, provides confluence with the targets discussed of around $5000 for bitcoin price. Whereas a failure implies risk to the downside of around $2500. But this would mean the bears needing to break the 200 WMA, which has held on each asking thus far.In summary, bitcoin price continues to grind its way higher but continues to threaten a more significant move. With 10 days remaining in March and with price being pressed against $4,000 once again, it is likely that the next move with be a definitive one in terms of dictating the price action for the following few weeks.However, the market remains in bearish territory, which must not be overlooked. Higher highs across multiple timeframes will be the first step in a trend change. But until then, despite the good news on low timeframes, the macro view of bitcoin price remains bearish until proven otherwise.Trade Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

Gox Hodling Funds Worth Over Half a Billion DollarsEver since the industry was rocked by the collapse of its biggest cryptocurrency exchange in 2014, it\u2019s been a long and painful waiting period for users out of pocket.

And waiting, and waiting\u20262014 to today is light years in the cryosphere and a series of events have since passed. Ex-CEO Mark Karpeles spent a year in a Japanese prison despite reportedly claiming his innocence. Reports found that the dumping of Mt. Gox bitcoins on the market caused its tailspin last year.And more recently, it emerged that Karpeles will likely avoid a lengthier time in the slammer by serving a four-year suspended sentence.But finally, the moment everyone has been waiting for: According to a report published by the Mt. Gox trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi, the exchange still has over 141,000 BTC and 142,000 BCH. Nobuaki Kobayashi is entrusted with returning these funds to the users.Will Mt.

Gox may have almost 70 billion yen ($631,965,561 USD) or over half a billion dollar\u2019s worth of BTC and BCH, the liabilities will likely be far more.Further documents speak about how users will be notified if their claim for funds is approved or rejected based on whether they filed online or via email.

In the same world in which the Easter Bunny and Santa Clause exist.One excited user on Reddit said that he received an email with the good news that his claim was approved. However, the criteria for approval or denial is unclear, judging by the Reddit users in the comments who said their claims were refused.When Will the Funds Be Returned to the Lucky Users?If you\u2019re one of the Mt.

The last time, BTC enjoyed such a run was in April 2018.Bitcoin Optimism Continues to GrowDominance slide or not, there is growing optimism among BTC bulls as to prospects of the cryptocurrency in 2019. Bitcoin trading guru, Tone Vays says he predicts BTC at $6,000 as long it breaks the $4,200 barrier.But Vays isn\u2019t the only one who sees BTC going beyond the $5,000 mark with TRON CEO, Justin Sun forecasting that Bitcoin would trade between $3,000 and $5,000 in 2019.Tom Lee of Fundstrat, in a market outlook delivered at the start of the year, also declared a reversal of negative market factors adding to a tailwind that would push BTC price higher in 2019.Should a declining dominance constitute a worry for Bitcoin users? Well, historical data shows the opposite as the lowest Bitcoin dominance index ever recorded was around 32 percent in December 2017 when the BTC price was at its record high of $20,000.Altseason Dilutes BTC Market ShareSo, with consistent price gains over a significant amount of time, why then is the BTC dominance index slipping. The trend seems most likely due to the steady rise of the altcoin market value diluting the BTC market share.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is up a whopping 22 percent in the last seven days, with Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum (ETH) also posting impressive 7-day gains. All top ten altcoins are currently showing positive price movements over the last seven days as well.Yes. This is one of the signs. The writing is on the wall. https://t.co/FAQOFtocQP\u2014 Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) March 20, 2019Outside of the top ten, tokens like Maximine Coin, KuCoin Shares, Ravencoin, and Huobi Token have also surged more than 50 percent within the same period. Dubbed \u201caltseason,\u201d the massive price increase of many altcoins at the same time is having a negative impact of BTC dominance.The total cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $141 billion, its highest level since late February 2019, no doubt partly due to the current altcoin resurgence. Massive price gains aside, some experts like Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, say investors shouldn\u2019t get carried.In a tweet published on Thursday (March 21, 2019), Greenspan said:Ginormous price movement is not an indication of a worthwhile token. Please stay safe during this #altseason and always #DYOR before investing.However, one pertinent question is whether this impact on dominance extends outside market capitalization figures; a metric which often gets a lot of flak from many experts.Moreover, Bitcoin users probably shouldn\u2019t be too concerned. The lowest Bitcoin dominance index ever recorded was around 32 percent in December 2017 when the BTC price was at its record high of $20,000.Do you consider market dominance a meaningful indicator?

All resulting work will be open and free.#BitcoinTwitter and #CryptoTwitter!

Switzerland\u2019s Federal Assembly is the country\u2019s legislative authority.Per the proposed regulations, the existing legislation of both administrative and judicial authorities should be adapted and applied to cryptocurrencies as well.While making his proposition, Merlini argued that:Cryptocurrencies could be issued to anyone with a decentralized, cryptographic-based peer-to-peer data network. A large part of the cryptocurrencies is completely anonymous, which favored extortion and money laundering.It\u2019s worth noting that this narrative has little support given Europol\u2019s assessment from late 2018.

The country classifies virtual currencies as assets and it has fairly relaxed regulatory burdens and low entry barriers.In December, the country\u2019s finance minister Ueli Maurer said that instead of coming up with new cryptocurrency-specific regulations, the Federal Assembly will be adapting existing ones to fit the needs of the industry.Following the motion\u2019s approval, however, Maurer, stated that the proposal has gone further than the scope of the planned regulations.Arguments have also been made against the motion, as it had failed to clarify how and if there are measures to be taken to mitigate any risks.Additional doubts have been raised whether cryptocurrency trading platforms \u201cshould be equated with the financial intermediaries and subjected to Switzerland\u2019s Financial market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).Switzerland\u2019s progress in terms of cryptocurrency adoption, on the other hand, can\u2019t be unnoticed.

Let\u2019s take a look at the current situation and where ETH/USD may be headed next. Ethereum Price Stirs BearsWhile the general market set up was bullish up till this morning, the echo chamber of bullish news and moon sighting technical analysts coming from all angles seems to be generating a bit of confirmation bias within the crypto community. Hopefully today\u2019s Ethereum price pullback will serve as a reminder that just because everyone says it is so doesn\u2019t make it so. On the BUIDL side of things, partnerships, new developments, protocol upgrades, and mainstream adoption just keeps chugging along strong and this is great for the everyone, technologists, and speculators included. Investors seem to be playing whack a mole with the hottest altcoins and Ontology, LOOM, Enjin, BAT are all evidence of this. BTC price stability around $4,000 is providing lucrative opportunities for those trading BTC/Altcoin pairings and Binance\u2019s IOST competition with a 16,000 BNB purse is sure to perk traders interest in the same way it did for ONT\u2019s, which managed to gain approximately 30% during Binance\u2019s recent trading competition. 4-Hour ChartETH price 00 has been locked in a tightening range with resistance at $138, $140 and $142, and today\u2019s hiccup pulled ETH below a strong support at $135.This pinned in price action corresponds with BTC\u2019s repeated rejection at $4k and $4,050 and today\u2019s pullback could mean bears have woken up from their brief nap and re-established their positions at BTCs recent top. Price action over the coming days with provide greater insight into this. ETH found support at $132 and now consolidates near $134. With the exception of a high volume break out from Bitcoin, ETH will likely return to the $135 to $138 range and remain pinned in by overhead resistance. Daily ChartThe daily chart shows that Ethereum price broke below the ascending trendline but the altcoin is slowly crawling back into the upper arm of the Bollinger band indicator and the exponential moving averages have not turned bearish. The weekly time frame raises some cautions signals and ETH is on the verge of losing its uptrend and closely currently rides atop the 26ema. On the 4-hr chart, the RSI flatlined in oversold territory and the Stoch and MACD remain bearish Conservative traders could wait for a bullish cross over and enter on strength above $140, $142, while swing traders might have an opportunity to purchase at or below the recent swing low if ETH\u2019s situation fails to improve. ETH traders should also keep an eye on the 12 and 26 EMA on the ETH/BTC pairing as it has provided a bit more insight than the ETH/USD pairing.

The report comes specifically from Binance Research, the exchange\u2019s market analysis team. The research report, titled \u201cAre Cryptoassets Highly Correlated?: An exploration of relationships between Bitcoin and other large cap digital assets,\u201d was published on March 20. It reveals that there are other elements that potentially influence the correlation between digital currencies and cryptoassets, which tend to move in tandem. (Namely, where Bitcoin goes, the altcoins follow.)Some of the key takeaways of the report include the ideas that the Bitcoin (BTC) is indeed \u201cthe bellwether of the industry,\u201d a fact further proven by the high correlation between market capitalizations for the top 30 cryptocurrencies over the past three months. However, BTC returns for major cryptocurrencies experienced lower correlations than USD-denominated returns over the same timeframe.BTC-correlated returns were significantly lower than in late 2017, but USD-correlated returns increased. This phenomenon is largely due to the increased focus on stablecoins in the cryptocurrency market, with many traders tethering to Tether (USDT) or other stablecoins while trading instead of using Bitcoin as a base.Major news and developmental announcements have unsurprisingly been found to influence specific coins\u2019 prices, and Binance has confirmed what it calls the \u201cBinance Effect,\u201d which means that \u201cdigital assets listed on Binance oftentimes have higher correlations among themselves.\u201dFinally, the last key takeaway is that a cryptocurrency\u2019s specific consensus mechanism may affect the correlation between returns.Overall, the exchange\u2019s research wing provides nothing particularly groundbreaking or mindblowing with its research, but it confirms many interesting facts that cryptocurrency industry enthusiasts have speculated about over recent months.What do you think of Binance Research\u2019s report about cryptoasset correlation?

After trading at just under $0.50 for an extended period, XTZ/USD 00 shot up to a peak of more than $0.83, delivering three-day gains of 70 percent.The performance marks a dramatic change for the token, which had previously traded rangebound between $0.33 and $0.49 since early December.That \u2018trough\u2019 had come at the end of a long downturn for XTZ, which had shed value in line with the majority of altcoins as part of the cryptocurrency economy\u2019s record bear market.At press time, the pair had slightly come off its daily highs to trade nearer to $0.80, nonetheless to the delight of traders, some of whom had seen the opportunity beginning to develop before. False Positive?As Bitcoinist reported, Tezos has suffered multiple PR disasters in the eighteen months following its giant initial coin offering (ICO), which raised over $230 million. A mixture of executive infighting, reshuffles and lack of progress frustrated token holders, some of whom even brought a lawsuit against the platform. XTZ\u2019s inflation would therefore appear to be a reaction to the only sign of progress to have appeared in recent times: this week, Tezos completed its voting procedure governing futures upgrades.In a blog post, Tezos said it was \u201cexcited\u201d about the progress, with the voting process set to enter its next stage, consisting of a roughly three-week period.By contrast, developers had previously suggested that the upgrades would not be of huge interest to the wider community.\u201cGrosso modo, most implications are at a technical level and the expected impact is very low to most stakeholders,\u201d a previous blog post read in January.The Tie\u2019s The LimitAt the same time, a popular theory surrounding TEZ has grown to involve a certain media appearance by Tim Draper, the billionaire Bitcoin advocate who is also a major investor in, and supporter of, Tezos and its founders.In an interview as part of the HBO documentary \u2018The Inventor: Out For Blood In Silicon Valley,\u2019 which focuses on infamous startup Theranos, Draper defended the company\u2019s founder, Elizabeth Holmes, while wearing a Bitcoin tie.As Bitcoinist noted, the tie in fact makes regular appearances in the media, but within the context of Theranos, appeared to strike a chord with a fresh, much more mainstream audience.

According to a report from Washington, D.C.-based non-profit research and advocacy center Coin Center, the proposed laws in Mexico would hamstring cryptocurrency exchanges ability to access the local banking system. In doing so, cryptocurrency exchanges would be effectively banned, even though the law would not explicitly forbid their operation.The proposed regulation reportedly comes straight from Mexico\u2019s central bank, which surely has little interest in seeing cryptocurrencies and digital assets flourish in the country, and flies straight in the face of what the original fintech legislation aimed to achieve \u2014 namely, the facilitation of effective cryptocurrency exchange regulation. Preventing exchanges from accessing legacy financial institutions does not facilitate, however, but effectively kills.As stated by Coin Center:The Mexican central bank\u2019s proposal unfortunately demonstrates a dismissive ignorance of how these technologies work. The rationale for the proposed rule is breathtaking: that the \u201ccomplexity of the mathematical and cryptographic processes that underlie digital assets\u201d and the \u201cdifficulty for users to understand these processes,\u201d along with the volatility of digital assets, presents an information asymmetry problem that, apparently, can only be addressed by quarantining consumers from direct contact with crypto.Banco de M\u00e9xico\u2019s proposed legislation implies that citizens of the country are incapable of understanding cryptocurrencies and, thus, should be restricted from purchasing them. From another perspective, this is clearly another example of a central bank deciding to act in its own self-interests by pretending to be looking out for the best interest of the common man.The public is able to voice its opinion on the matter for 60 days following the rule proposal.What do you think of Banco de M\u00e9xico\u2019s proposal to effectively kill cryptocurrency exchanges in the country by preventing them from accessing financial systems?

Ethereum Price Matters Says Vitalik ButerinSpeaking to a full house at the Columbia Journalism School on Wednesday, March 20th, Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, stated that the price of the Ethereum token (ETH) must sustain its high level to ensure that the Ethereum ecosystem continues to develop.The 25 year old Russian-Canadian programmer explained to host Laura Shin that many of his fellow developers previously didn\u2019t pay much attention to Ether price. Back then, much of the Ethereum team downplayed the market price of the ETH token as the focus was largely on developing smart contract technology. It was also a way for the Ethereum team to distinguish itself from other crypto projects that were \u201cLambo-ing\u201d instead. In retrospect, however, this position was incorrect, he admitted.\u201cI\u2019m going to be really candid,\u201d said Buterin.Some of the early rhetoric about the price not mattering at all\u2026in part came from signaling that Ethereum was different from other projects that did pumping and Lambo-ing way too much.Today, Ethereum developers realize that \u201cprojects will be better if prices go up.\u201d According to Buterin, it would be rather difficult to develop the Ethereum ecosystem at a low price. It\u2019s always better when the price is higher. If the price is equal to zero, then the network cannot be sure, he adds.Buterin also weighed in on whether the 2014 Ethereum token offering may be in violation of securities law, saying: We definitely have our lawyers and our legal team. We don\u2019t have a reason to worry right now.Pumping GasToday, ETH price is down roughly 90 percent from its all-time high of nearly $1,400 in December 2017. So it may come as no surprise that funding protocol development is becoming a concern amid a prolonged \u2018crypto winter\u2019 and industry-wide layoffs.Earlier this month, Buterin proposed a new way to boost project development. This involves increasing transaction fees (referred to as Gas) from network users to fund promising projects on the Ethereum platform.I propose we consider supporting a community norm that client/wallet devs can/should charge a 1 gwei/gas fee for txs sent through their wallet, we don't try to circumvent such fees, and we support protocol changes to make such fees easier (eg. abstraction enabling multisends)\u2014 Vitalik Non-giver of Ether (@VitalikButerin) March 8, 2019\u201cAt the cost of only increasing average user gas costs by ~7%, it would raise up to $2m/year in sustainable non-institutionally-biased market-based funding for client/wallet developers,\u201d he continued.For reference, that would cover all EF grants to date to eth2 client devs (not including Parity, which is not just eth2\u2026) with room to spare.Today, ETH price continues to sustain levels above $130 USD, after recovering from yearly lows of under $85 in mid-December 2018. Ethereum is arguably the second most well-known blockchain behind Bitcoin, and is the second biggest cryptocurrency by a market capitalization of over $14 billion.At the same time, some analysts are bullish on ETH. A recent report from research firm Delphi Digital notes that Ether could even outperform Bitcoin if the market makes another bull-run like in late 2017.

Paris is one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities currently. But it\u2019s also now vying for its place as a blockchain hub. One of the goals of the PBW is to encourage international blockchain projects to put down roots here.Throughout the week there will be a series of events. These include workshops, hackathons, keynotes, and of course, fancy cocktail parties to showcase the country\u2019s fine champagne as well as burgeoning tech scene.Some of the highlights of the week include a \u20ac10k prize for the first team to create an entire blockchain and UI on the Cosmos mainnet. There will also be a gathering of the world\u2019s top French-speaking CEOs, entrepreneurs, and investors organized by FrenchFounders.The flagship event of the week, however, is the Paris Blockchain Week Summit, which organizers expect to attract some 1,500 attendees.What to Expect from the Paris Blockchain Week SummitThe Paris Blockchain Week Summit (PBWS) is a two-day long conference taking place at Station F. The event will gather some of the most influential thought-leaders, decision-makers, and movers and shakers in the blockchain space. Among the speakers are Tezos co-Founder Arthur Breitman, MyEtherWallet\u2019s COO Brian Norton, and Ripple\u2019s Global Head of Banking Marjan Delatinne. Ledger\u2019s President Pascal Gauthier will, of course, be delivering a keynote as well, as will eToro\u2019s CEO Yoni Assia. Speakers on the main stage will discuss EU regulation, decentralized exchanges, stable coins, scalability issues, advances in consensus mechanisms, governance, PoW vs PoS, sharding, the integration of AI in distributed algorithms, and many other topics besides. With Switzerland, Malta, and even Lichtenstein gathering all the attention, this is Paris\u2019 chance to show the world that the country is open for blockchain business\u2013and that France is a contender in the race. France is one of the few G20 countries to have drafted a framework for blockchain entrepreneurs over the last year. Its regulators are open-minded and advised by the likes of industry heavyweights Ledger and La French Tech. France is definitely beginning to show that the climate is thawing for blockchain businesses here.Cryptocurrency Adoption in FranceSome of the largest companies in the industry have come out of France. However, while Bitcoinist reported on the efforts of French protestors and street artist Pascal Boyart to spread the word on Bitcoin, France hasn\u2019t been a major contender so far.With the Paris Blockchain Week Summit backed by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, as well as the Secretary of State for Digital Affairs, it looks like while other G20 countries are falling behind, France is getting serious.Images courtesy of ShutterstockThe Rundown Paris Blockchain Week Takes Place April 13-19What to Expect from the Paris Blockchain Week SummitCryptocurrency Adoption in France"}

Bitcoinist | Mar 25, 2019 | 14:00 Share Tweet Send Share Cryptocurrency trading undoubtedly presents an opportunity for sweeping in serious profits. However, periods of steady and prolonged declines might be more challenging to take advantage of and as such, below are a few important considerations to take into account. If you want to be a successful trader, you need to learn how to make profits when the markets are up but also when they are down. The key part is not only to be profitable when the market is growing, but also to make successful trades when it\u2019s declining.What to do in a declining market?Swing trading is one of the most relevant and efficient strategies that you can take advantage of. Even though trading cryptocurrencies in itself can be very profitable, it\u2019s important to note that most of the altcoins in today\u2019s market move correlated to Bitcoin. That\u2019s to say that when Bitcoin moves, most of the medium and large market cap altcoins move with it.In turn, this oftentimes leaves traders without a lot of options when the market declines. In fact, for a lot of traders, this means that they have to wait, holding their money in stablecoins or in fiat as the majority of exchanges don\u2019t offer leveraged trading products or access to other markets.Evolve Markets, on the other hand, is a platform which allows users to trade cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities and indices, with leverage up to 500:1, providing many options and alternatives to solely trading cryptocurrencies.So, instead of passively waiting on the sidelines for the next convenient entry point, a lot of successful traders remain active during one market decline, but they switch to other markets.Despite the fact that there are common points when it comes to trading on most markets, it\u2019s also important to adapt your style and learn new valuable skills. New skills will help you get better at trading any market. These include learning advanced trading analysis (TA), as well as learning different ways to utilize trading with leverage on a trading platform such as Evolve Markets.Different Markets to Take Advantage OfIf you want to diversify your cryptocurrency trading and experience the different markets, you\u2019ve got a few options in front of you.ForexForex is perhaps one of the most commonly traded markets out there. It refers to the foreign exchange market and it comes down to trading different currencies. It\u2019s the largest and most liquid market in the world.CommoditiesIn economics, the term commodity is used to describe an economic good or service which has either full or at least substantial fungibility. Gold, for example, is a commodity.IndicesIndices are a very important part of the financial market. That\u2019s essentially a stock index which measures the performance of a group of shares from a particular exchange. One of the most popular indexes is the Dow Jones or the FTSE 100.A lot of traders, however, fear that if they are active on other markets, they are potentially missing out on big cryptocurrency bull runs. That\u2019s not necessarily true. When you learn new strategies and when you grow as a trader, you will also become more patient, get more experience, and, in general, develop a lot better timing. This is something that can help you be a lot more profitable when trading cryptocurrencies and become a lot more successful on all of your fronts of activity.[Disclaimer: The contents of this article are for educational purposes only and should not be taken as financial advice.

He met with president Mauricio Macri last Wednesday, ahead of a Fintech and Blockchain summit organized by his dedicated Argentine fund, Draper Cygnus.The 60-year-old remains in the spotlight after hitting mainstream media headlines for a different kind of Bitcoin plug last week.\u201cWe talked about bitcoin and the devaluation of the peso, and I proposed a bet,\u201d the publication quotes him as telling the audience of the summit. [I]f the peso is valued more than Bitcoin, I double the investment I am making in the country; and if Bitcoin acquires more value than the peso\u2026 that would be a perfect solution because there is no confidence in the currency.Not Just VenezuelaAs Bitcoinist has mentioned, Argentina has faced currency problems and its associated effects, such as \u2018brain drain,\u2019 for several years. As much attention focuses on Venezuela as a crucible of economic collapse and Bitcoin as a rescue package, Argentina has given increasing hints that its utility in the face of its own adversity cannot be ignored. From official warnings over using Bitcoin several years ago, real-world use cases began appearing in 2019. For Draper, Argentina is ripe for disruption using Blockchain technology and Bitcoin itself. Speaking to La Naci\u00f3n, the millionaire gave his vision for how corporations could look like within the context of a suitable regulatory landscape from Buenos Aires.\u201c\u2026[T]hrough blockchain, you build a contract, and with bitcoin, you can make sure that you are making the premium payments and you can make sure that someone who makes a claim receives their payment immediately,\u201d he explained. That can go for social security, for health insurance for all these things that governments historically have provided. Now governments have a better tool to provide all this and have a tool that can go beyond borders, which would stop being tribes to become a great world giving us services.Big Bitcoin TradesConsumer appetite already appears to be in place. According to data from Coin Dance, last week was Argentina\u2019s seventh-largest in terms of trade volume on P2P cryptocurrency exchange Localbitcoins. With almost 8 million pesos ($214,000) changing hands, the figure is only marginally behind the all-time high set in early December of 9.4 million ($226,000).Draper meanwhile is perhaps an unlikely advocate for political lobbying, having already surprised TV audiences last week when he appeared in an HBO documentary about Theranos wearing a Bitcoin tie. The trademark garment, which has made various appearances in media interviews by Draper, nonetheless earned him a new, albeit mixed, following in both formal and social media. It is, however, unknown whether or not Draper was wearing the tie during his meeting with president Macri.What do you think about Tim Draper\u2019s Bitcoin bet with Mauricio Macri?

Last year, the global cryptocurrency ATM market sat at $18.503 million USD, according to the report.This booming growth is expected to be led by the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), which will increase demand for cryptocurrency ATMs, in turn. The hospitality industry is also expected to be a leading driver of cryptocurrency ATM adoption.The main roadblock to cryptocurrency ATM adoption is government regulation, of course.Increased Demand in the Asia PacificThe report finds that North America and Europe unsurprisingly garner a large market share of the cryptocurrency ATM market, but the Asia Pacific region is expected to see an increase demand for the machines on account of \u201crising disposable income and growing popularity of cryptocurrency.\u201dSome of the major cryptocurrency ATM companies examined in the report are Genesis Coin, Inc., General Bytes, Lamassu, Inc., Bitaccess, Coinsource, Covault, and Mainstreet Automaten GmbH.Cryptocurrency ATMs Already Spreading Like WildfireThe report only confirms what many in the cryptocurrency industry already know \u2014 or, at least, suspect.Chicago has recently seen a significant increase in cryptocurrency ATMs, thanks to Atlanta-based Lux Vending.

The first one is filed by Bitwise Asset Management and published in the Federal Register on February 15th, is scheduled for a decision on April 1st.The CBOE-backed VanEck/SolidX Bitcoin ETF application, on the other hand, was published in the Federal Register on February 20th, meaning that its first deadline is on April 6th. It\u2019s important to note, however, that these are not decisive deadlines and that the SEC has, technically, up to 240 days to come up with a final decision.However, according to VanEck\u2019s Digital Asset Director, Gabor Gurbacs, these \u201cETF deadlines are largely inconsequential.\u201dVanEck, as well as SolidX, have already invested a lot of time and resources building the necessary market structure in order to create the right \u201cbackbone for an ETF,\u201d explains Gurbacs.These \u201cETF deadlines\u201d are largely inconsequential in my view. VanEck and SolidX has invested many years of building, market structure work as well time and significant resources to create the right backbone for an ETF. We continue to do the hard work to make this happen. \ud83d\ude4c\u2014 Gabor Gurbacs (@gaborgurbacs) March 24, 2019Previously, Gurbacs has shared his thoughts on how a Bitcoin ETF will serve the public interest, outlining several potential benefits, including but not limited to an established compliance framework, transparent fees, and increased liquidity.Will a Bitcoin ETF Approval Catalyze Price Surge?Perhaps one of the most discussed questions is whether a potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF drives any significant increase in bitcoin price.While there\u2019s obviously no precedent to work with, we can look at the performance of one of the commodities that Bitcoin is very frequently compared to \u2013 gold.The first gold-backed ETF was developed by ETF securities and launched back on March 28th, 2003.At the time, gold was trading at about $300. Following the approval of the gold-backed ETF, the price started to increase, surging to almost as much as $1900 in August 2011 \u2013 around eight years later.Of course, the performance of gold is definitely not in any ways indicative of where Bitcoin might go if an ETF is eventually approved. However, as Bitcoinist has reported in the past, historic gold and Bitcoin price charts are almost identical.It\u2019s also important to note that gold represents a huge market, with some estimates putting its current value above $8 trillion. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a total market cap of a little less than $71 billion. There\u2019s obviously a lot of room for it to grow, especially given the fact that Bitcoin is still a drop in the bucket of the global investment market.Prominent Bitcoin proponents and investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have even gone so far to predict that Bitcoin will pass gold\u2019s 7 trillion-dollar market cap.Do you think a Bitcoin ETF approval would cause a surge in Bitcoin price?

Tron is now available to trade on eToro!Tron has been one of the most highly requested cryptos from clients looking to trade it on our platform, so we are very proud to provide it today.The idea of the project is simple yet ambitious, to create a decentralized internet or Web 4.0, where content creators will have full ownership of their materials and will be directly compensated for it, thereby bypassing the FAANGs.Here\u2019s a quick video that explains a bit further from my friend Tony at Thinking Crypto.Enjoy!@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsStocks Still in ConsolidationBonds are InvertedCrypto Wash for ETFPlease note: All details, figures & graphs are valid as of March 25th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsStocks took a turn for the worse on Friday afternoon. The move lower does seem to have carried over the weekend into the Asian and European sessions.Overall though, I\u2019d say we\u2019re not really in a bull market. Nor are we in a bear one. Here we can see the Dow Jones ever since Donald Trump\u2019s election. What it looks like at the moment is that we\u2019re simply consolidating near the top.With the heavy hand of the Fed now fully in support of the markets and many analysts claiming that we\u2019re near the end of one of the longest bull runs in history, this thing could really go either way.Inversion TimeOne of the reasons being noted for the recent stock declines is a well-known indicator that is known to foreshadow a recession, an inversion of the bond yields.When long term bond yields are lower than short term yields, economists start to worry that investors are pricing in some upcoming trouble.The big one that is more closely watched is the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year notes, but on Friday the spread 10-year and the 3-month bonds went negative for the first time since 2007.Some economists, including Mohamed El-Erian, have already dismissed this signal saying that there is a danger in misinterpreting it. El-Erian believes that the data itself doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate a recession is coming but he\u2019s afraid that this could become a self-fulfilling prophecy if investors believe that it does.Washing Out an ETFSo this next story hits strongly at two of the top topics in crypto at the moment, the rampant level of wash trading in the industry, and the possible approval of a bitcoin ETF suitable for US institutional investors by the SEC.In their effort to get a new Bitcoin backed ETF approved by US authorities, a company called Bitwise has just released a 226-slide presentation for the SEC, which presents a unique and groundbreaking view of the bitcoin market.Truth is, they probably could have squeezed the report onto much fewer pages but the way it\u2019s presented makes it much easier to digest. The visual representation is key to driving their points home.Bitwise claim is that 95% of bitcoin volumes reported on sites like coinmarketcap are indeed false.They even give great examples of how to spot this fake volume by comparing the order books of a clean exchanges to those of suspicious ones.Of 81 exchanges examined in the report, only 10 are reporting real volumes. With the total reaching about $270 million per day.This, says bitwise, is actually a great thing because there are 10 reliable, mostly regulated brokers, that they can take their pricing from when offering an ETF. This argument directly addresses the SEC\u2019s previously stated concerns of market manipulation and maturity.In short, what they\u2019re saying is that, while there are many exchanges who are reporting false pricing and volumes, if we ignore them completely, we can see that the real bitcoin market is actually quite mature and resistant to manipulation and arbitrage.In short, this report brings the bitcoin market into an entirely new light and has somewhat altered my personal perception of the current market conditions for the better.Let\u2019s have an amazing week ahead!Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalysteToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

Let\u2019s take a closer look at the BTC price action to look what may be in store for the final week of March.4-HOUR CHARTLooking at the 4-hour chart, we can see that Bitcoin price has been in a downward trajectory almost immediately since Monday morning. The relatively high volume sell-off found lows of $3850, from which it bounced to $3940 but was subsequently rejected.Price action has since been tightening up around $3900 but continues to threaten more downside action as a bearish pennant is forming. This would imply a potential downside risk of new weekly lows around $3800. The MACD supports this scenario as it continues its downward trajectory and the histogram printing new lows. In other words, the bears are in control.1-DAY CHARTLooking at the 1-Day Bitcoin Chart, the market remains in a bottoming pattern, which requires completion. This will only occur if bitcoin price can close with a higher high above $4250 on the daily chart.The monthly open of $3780 can be seen to be at the 50 and 100-day moving averages. The bearish momentum currently shows an initial target on the 4-hour chart at around $3800.Meanwhile, the 50 and 100-day moving averages on the daily chart are potentially acting as support where the bulls generally need to defend the monthly open. This implies that the slow the bleed to the downside may meet some resistance at around $3800.Volume in the BTC market remains to be slowly in decline, which is implicit of a bigger move being in the works. The MACD on the daily remains above zero, but is slowly trending downwards and there it crossed bearish with its signal line.MONTHLY CHARTWith five days remaining before bitcoin price closes the month, the weekly chart shows that BTC/USD is on course for a second consecutive monthly green candle for the first time in this bear market.Price continues to be supported by the 50-Month moving average, which is currently at the lows of $3185 seen in December 2018.The MACD line is threatening to pull up before crossing into bearish territory, which can be seen by a second consecutive higher low on the histogram.Therefore, the levels mentioned earlier will be critical for the bulls. If the market can flush down to $3800 and bounce back up to around $4000, the monthly close will look very positive for the bulls.However, if the bulls can only produce a disappointing $3800 doji candle, or worse, the bears will be in position to capitalize in April. So these final few days of March will be pivotal as we slide back to $3800 on Tuesday.In summary: bulls have some work to do to end March on a positive note, with $3800 being the critical battle ground.Trade Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

A common factor influencing the bans was a lack of transparency regarding the end product, while the relatively nascent stage of the cryptocurrency phenomenon allegedly left users unfairly prone to scams.Language Points To Altcoin Scams\u201cCryptocurrency as an asset class saw a bull run in 2018, increasing valuations multi-fold. The high returns and volatility of cryptocurrencies invited a lot of interest from retail investors and speculators looking to make a quick return,\u201d Bing reflected on its policy. There wasn\u2019t much regulatory oversight, and the overall pseudo-anonymity built into currencies like bitcoin made cryptocurrency a prime target for fraudsters and scam artists to defraud end-users.Classifying 2018 as crypto\u2019s bull year, Bing, perhaps unconsciously, appeared to hint that it was altcoin projects which attracted the lion\u2019s share of suspicion.Bitcoin prices had already begun falling in the second half of December 2017, but it was only the following month that altcoin markets saw their own all-time highs.No Change On The HorizonDemonizing Bitcoin would in turn place Microsoft at odds with ad ban ally Twitter, the CEO of which, Jack Dorsey, this year begun publicly championing the largest cryptocurrency. As Bitcoinist reported, praise of scaling solution the Lightning Network rapidly evolved into full advocacy, with Dorsey promising the technology would ultimately come to both Twitter and his payment platform Square.At the same time, Facebook has hinted it is also preparing to embrace cryptocurrency to a certain extent.

With such returns, it\u2019s no surprise that demand is now rising and other exchanges are now copying the new model. 271% Average Gains on Binance LaunchpadTokens of projects launched through Binance Launchpad have gained 271% of their IEO dollar price at the time of this writing.So far, the platform has launched three projects, namely BitTorrent, Fetch.AI, and Celer Network.As seen on the table above, the tokens of every single one of them has seen its price skyrocket at the time it got listed on Binance.During its IEO, BitTorrent Token (BTT) was sold at a price of $0.00012. As soon as it got listed, its price catapulted with about 330 percent. It has increased even more since, currently trading at 483 percent higher compared to its IEO dollar value. The cryptocurrency has also increased against Binance Coin (BNB). Presently, it marks gains of around 154 percent.Fetch.AI (FET) token was sold at a price of $0.0867. Following its listing, its dollar price increased by 367 percent. Currently, FET is trading 119 percent higher compared to its IEO dollar price and 36 percent higher against BNB.Celer Network (CELR) token was sold at a price of $0.0067 during its IEO. Its listing price was around $0.030 or about 350 percent higher. At the time of this writing, CELR is trading at a price 213 percent higher compared to its IEO dollar value and 197 percent higher when trading against BNB.On average, the tokens were listed at a price 350 percent higher than their IEO dollar value. Their ongoing performance is also somewhat impressive, as they\u2019ve managed to retain a notably higher value, marking increases of 271 percent against the USD.Demand Likely to RiseDespite being undoubtedly successful for the projects themselves, Binance Launchpad has experienced continuous technical issues handling the high buying demand.In fact, it seems that people are getting more and more interested in participating, likely because of the returns outlined above.Immediately after the last sale \u2013 that of Celer Network, Changpeng \u2018CZ\u2019 Zhao, CEO at Binance, said that it was \u201cactually the highest buy demand sale we seen so far.\u201dYet, out of 39,003 people, only 3,129 managed to buy CELR tokens, suggesting that less than 10 percent of everyone who attempted to buy actually managed to do so. The sentiment was similar throughout the previous sales as well.VIP Access for BNB Hodlers ComingSince then, Binance has come up with somewhat of a solution. Instead of handling the orders on \u201cfirst-in-first-served\u201d basis and coping with their technical issues, Binance has decided to conduct the sales using a lottery format.As Bitcoinist reported, the platform will be implementing a BNB daily holding average criteria for users who want to get tickets to participate in the sales. These tickets will then be selected randomly, allowing their owners to purchase a pre-determined amount of tokens.Other Exchanges Replicating IEO ModelOther exchanges were quick to see the potential in having their in-house IEO factories.KuCoin announced its so-called Spotlight platform and will host its first IEO on April 3rd. The model they are going for is more or less the same as it was on Binance Launchpad prior to their decision to implement a lottery-like format.Huobi Global is another well-known exchange which has also boarded the new hypetrain. Their platform is called Huobi Prime. Unlike KuCoin and Binance, however, they\u2019ve taken a fairly different approach.Instead of conducting a \u201csale\u201d, per se, Huobi Prime will directly list the new tokens for trading against USDT, Huobi Token (HT), BTC, and ETH. Each sale will go through three preliminary trading rounds of 30 minutes where users will only be able to place regular market orders at a tradable price which is capped for each round. Once they are through, regular trading of the new token will be allowed.Huobi Prime will have its first selective token listing on March 26th.It\u2019s also worth noting that this new craze has had a splendid effect on the exchanges\u2019 native tokens.Binance Coin (BNB) has managed to more than tripple its price in the last three months. Huobi Token (HT) has surged by more than 130 percent in the same period, while KuCoin Shares (KCS) sees gains of about 120 percent.What do you think of the newly shaped trend of exchange-backed IEOs?

This can come in any form, from trading of insults to concerted attacks on a certain coin, name or group of developers. This year, attention has focused on Ripple, as a mass cohort of Twitter accounts monitors and rebutts any criticism of the company or its associated XRP token \u2013 generating considerable negative publicity in the process. Ripple itself has not acknowledged any direct link with the phenomenon.As the ecosystem evolves, however, advocacy has become nuanced, with agendas designed to boost or discredit a target taking on the guise of seemingly innocent tweets.For Childs, this has resulted in a need to vet every tweet he reads according to four criteria: previous negative tweets, obvious bias from the past, and whether the author has criticized something towards which he or she is notionally biased.\u201cHowever this can be time consuming and it isn\u2019t always easy to tell someone\u2019s biases just by glancing at their profile,\u201d he argued.

He hypothesizes that the stock-to-flow (SF) ratio directly affects price discovery based on historical data.\u201cThe hypothesis in this study is that scarcity, as measured by [stock-to-flow], directly drives value,\u201d he explains.The model uses SF as its data input based on the power law formula (BTC = a*SF^b) with b as the fractal dimension to predict the possible price of bitcoin.According to this model:The predicted market value for bitcoin after May 2020 halving is $1trn, which translates in a bitcoin price of $55,000.Bitcoin Halving Will Reduce Bitcoin SupplyAs previously reported by Bitcoinist, the next halving will see the miner block reward go from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC sometime in May 2020. This would, of course, reduce the supply of bitcoins on the market and could indeed have massive implications for price.The last reward halving occurred in the summer of 2016. It was during this time period that bitcoin price began its long run-up to its historic highs of nearly $20,000 in December 2017.The next scheduled halving will likely also have a significant impact on the market as history doesn\u2019t often repeat, but it does rhyme.\u201cEvery halving, bitcoin [stock-to-flow] doubles and market value increases 10x,\u201d notes PlanB. \u201cThis is a constant factor.\u201dThe analyst draws similarities between the stock-to-flow ratio of Bitcoin and precious metals. Worth noting is Bitcoin\u2019s $230 billion market valuation during its peak bull-run, which PlanB says was very close to silver:What is very interesting is that gold and silver, which are totally different markets, are in line with the bitcoin model values for SF. This gives extra confidence in the model.If the trend continues, the next halving could propel Bitcoin\u2019s valuation closer to gold, he notes, addingBecause halvings have such a big impact on SF, I put months until the next halving as a color overlay in the chart\u2026Next halving is May 2020. Current SF of 25 will double to 50, very close to gold (SF 62).But Bitcoin is Better Than GoldBitcoin is the world\u2019s first digitally scarce object and often referred to as peer-to-peer gold, \u2018digital gold\u2019 or \u2018Gold 2.0.\u2019Besides being scarce, however, it can also be easily stored and sent over the internet, radio, and even satellite. Therefore, it\u2019s no surprise why some are predicting it will become more popular than gold as the go-to store of value in the digital age. \u201cWe believe bitcoin is better at being gold than gold,\u201d said the Winklevoss twins earlier this year. \u201cIf we\u2019re right, then over time the market cap of bitcoin will surpass the (approximately 7 trillion) dollar market cap of gold.\u201dIf Bitcoin indeed follows its historic price patterns, the $55,000 price at $1 trillion market cap may just be the start.With 17.6 million bitcoin already mined out of a total 21 million, the market is currently absorbing about 1,800 bitcoin per day or roughly $7 million dollars. What\u2019s more, the next reward halving means the inflation rate will fall to under two percent or below the Federal Reserve\u2019s inflation target.In other words, the decreasing supply of bitcoin will be felt by the markets over the next decade, which is what low time preference BTC permabulls like Tim Draper, Mike Novogratz, and Tom Lee are placing their bets on.What\u2019s your bitcoin price prediction after the 2020 halving?

Here\u2019s why it nothing like Bitcoin and is more underwhelming than a utility token with no use-case.Apple Announces Credit CardApple has long been revered as the world\u2019s most innovative company. There\u2019s no denying that the smartphone changed the way billions of people around the world live their lives forever. But it\u2019s time for the trailblazing tech company to wake up and smell the roses.While Apple was releasing one carbon-copy product after another at higher and higher prices, the competition was busy doing the opposite. Now the high-end, high-priced tech manufacturer is scrambling to hold its own in a rapidly evolving market. And with the launch of its underwhelming Apple Card, there\u2019s something sad about the stench of its desperation.Apple Card vs Samsung\u2019s Built-In Bitcoin WalletApple\u2019s largest competitor apart from the slew of cheaper Chinese products is undoubtedly Samsung. The South Korean giant hasn\u2019t had an easy ride either with equally pricey products getting undercut left and right.But as one large company embraces the future, its flagship Galaxy S10 coming with a built-in Bitcoin wallet, Apple\u2019s response is disappointing, to say the least.Rather than acknowledge the cryptocurrency revolution, and appeal to a younger market, the smartphone manufacturer aims to \u2018disrupt\u2019 the credit card industry. Isn\u2019t that the wrong pool to be swimming in?The revolution won\u2019t come in the form of borderless transactions since it\u2019s only available in the United States. It also won\u2019t be peer-to-peer, eliminate centralized institutions, or greatly reduce fees. Although its interest rates will be:Among the lowest in the industryMind. Blown.Apple\u2019s game plan is more about additional security of payments, no annual or foreign transaction fees, and the fact that (wait for it) its partner Goldman Sachs will never sell your data for marketing.You can even buy yourself a coffee on the Goldman Sachs blockchain. You just have to trust Apple and Goldman Sachs to do so.It\u2019s a Custodial Hardware Hot WalletThe Apple Card will come built into the iPhone\u2019s Wallet App, which effectively makes it a custodial hardware hot wallet for USD. Apple claims they will never track your transactions, and all the information will be held on your device.Users can request a laser-etched titanium card, should they be so inclined, although, there seems to be little point in that. In fact, why even offer a traditional card for a wallet the company wants you to get rid of in the first place?If you\u2019ve failed to be bowled over by so much innovation so far, there\u2019s more. Users can track their spending on their phone through a user-friendly app.You Have to Trust Goldman SachsIn the wake of major gaffes by tech companies like Facebook and Google, Apple is pushing its next-generation security and privacy features. The centralized entity will not track your transactions and Goldman Sachs (the other centralized entity) has agreed not to sell user data. Explosive stuff compared to a decentralized alternative financial system which requires no intermediaries at all.Increased adoption of Apple Pay? Perhaps. A revolution in finance? It\u2019s just as well Cook wasn\u2019t speaking at a Bitcoin conference, the audience would have walked out in droves.Steve Jobs Would Have Had Bitcoin in iOS by NowApple Card seems like a desperate bid to push Apply Pay onto the people rather than let them to choose how they manage their finances. CEO Tim Cook enthused that the card was:The most significant change in the credit card experience in 50 years.Exactly where has he been lately? Steve Jobs would have Bitcoin integrated into iOS by now. The aim of the game is presumably to bump up the adoption of Apple Pay in partnership with market leaders MasterCard and Goldman Sachs. Two giant financial institutions that will hardly feel the pinch from Apple Pay and its meager card.There are no real tangible benefits for users of the card beyond a few outstandingly mundane offers. For example, paying for Apple products with your built-in Apple Card gets you a whopping 1-3% cash back on purchases. So what is Apple thinking entering an already saturated market that swathes of people are trying to overthrow? Once on the cutting-edge of innovation, Apple now seems to be extremely myopic when it comes to the future.What do you this of this new credit card? Will it undermine payment-focused cryptocurrencies with low fees?

In a blog post published on Tuesday (March 26, 2019), the company explained the decisions taken as part of its efforts to align its business model.An excerpt from the statement reads:It was a difficult but necessary decision as we continue to build a long-term, sustainable and scalable business. We did our best to compensate our employees above the legal requirement.Bitmain also made some changes to its leadership structure with Haichao Wang, the former Engineering chief appointed as the new CEO. Co-founders Jihan Wu and Ketuan Zhan remain directors of the company and continue to have a say in \u201cbig decisions.\u201dBitmain Will Restart IPO Listing ProcessAs reported by Bitcoinist on Monday, the Bitmain IPO application at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) expired after six months. According to the company, regulators and other mainstream stakeholders aren\u2019t yet sold to the immense potential of the emerging cryptocurrency industry.In the meantime, Bitmain says it will restart the application at some time in the future. Despite the failure of its first IPO application, the company said the process did deliver some positives for the company especially in the area of financial transparency.Concerning transparency, Bitmain is yet to publish its financials for the second half of 2018. Speculation is rife with reports of huge losses for Q3 2018 of about $740 million.Any attempt to refile another IPO application will see the company being forced to publish its financial report for Q3 and maybe even Q4 2018 depending on the reporting period stipulated by the stock exchange operator.Bitmain Will Focus on Innovation and AIBitmain also revealed that its focus for 2019 will be on streamlining its business process to focus on innovation in both the cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI) market.Back in February 2019, Bitcoinist reported on the company\u2019s new 7-nm chip touted to deliver more efficient Bitcoin mining. On paper, the new chip will offer about a 28.6 percent improvement in power efficiency, compared to previous iterations of the company\u2019s 7-nm chip.For innovation in the AI scene, the blog post also mentions agreements already inked with important stakeholders across China.

If ever there were a clearer case of the pot calling the kettle black, it would be the world\u2019s most famous investor.Wells Fargo (a Buffett investment) has been fined a mind-boggling total of 93 times for fraudulent activities and other abuses since the turn of the century. How many fines has Bitcoin received? Zero. Wells Fargo, a Buffett investment, has been fined 93 times for fraud and other abuses, for a total of $14.8 billion in fines since just 2000I'll take bitcoin's \"charlatans\" over that any day https://t.co/9OZkzxgQ7x\u2014 Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) March 9, 2019Big Banks Are Often the Perpetrators of Criminal ActivityNot only have large banks found themselves in hot water over the years for their inadequate AML procedures. They\u2019ve also been found guilty of laundering the money themselves. According to calculations by Bloomberg, Deutsche Bank has paid out close to $18 billion in the last decade alone in AML fines. The bank also had its offices raided in November 2018 on suspicion of laundering a massive $200 billion of dirty money.Yet, they won\u2019t allow Bitcoin ATM makers and other genuine cryptocurrency companies to open accounts? Isn\u2019t that a little hypocritical? Just a little\u2026 Yet it also shows the size of the profit doesn\u2019t outweigh the risk involved.Bitcoin Isn\u2019t Big Enough YetSo if big bank fines topped $243 billion over 10 years, why do they keep acting this way? Because the profits they make from these activities far outweigh the sting from the fines. AML fines are a mere fraction of the billions of dollars more made from enabling criminal transactions.The same cannot be said for small cryptocurrency companies. As Dan Hedl pointed out, the entire cryptocurrency market cap is worth just $134 billion, dwarfed by AML fines alone. Most banks simply realize the risk isn\u2019t worth the reward. That\u2019s one theory. Another is that banks are simply trying to crush innovation and suppress Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because they see them as a threat. Let\u2019s not forget the very reason Bitcoin was born in the first place. With numbers like this, it can\u2019t be too long before society opens its eyes and realizes who the real charlatans are.Can a more honest monetary system be established using Bitcoin?

With elections in the country scheduled for April 11th, it seems things are heating up. The battle over cryptoassets is being waged on several fronts in the world\u2019s second most populated country. The dialogue between the government and the supreme court now has a deadline of March 29th, for the finance ministry to propose a regulatory framework for digital currencies.A hearing is set for this date, but as we\u2019ve seen before can certainly be pushed back. Very likely the outcome of this hearing may directly influence the court\u2019s decision on how they handle the RBI ban, which is still being contested.There\u2019s still no indication of what the finance ministry might do and there have been conflicting reports in the media with some saying they\u2019re considering an outright ban and others reporting that they\u2019re considering legalization and regulation.On the streets and on social media, it\u2019s very clear that the crypto community is growing. Town hall meetings that regularly see 300 to 400 attendants will now be held in eight cities across the country and the #IndiaWantsCrypto campaign on Twitter entering the 145th day.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsVolatility creeps back inBitcoin Correlation with GoldThe Bitcoin Chart CrossroadsPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of March 26th.

This graph shows the VIX volatility index over the last two years. Notice the uptick from the lows on March 11th (red circle), to today.The Fed\u2019s supportive stance does allow investors to allocate more capital to markets, but with stock valuations high, it seems like they have better places to put it. Many are turning to bonds causing yields to drop at a rapid pace.Others are turning to precious metals, which have been rising steadily since the start of the year.Is the Fed moving Crypto?In an interview yesterday with CoinTelegraph, I was asked how the Fed\u2019s recent policy shift is influencing cryptos. Indeed, more money for investments does seem to imply greater inflows into cryptoassets, especially with the rising level of institutional interest in the space.In fact, this next graph seems to imply this is indeed the case. Correlation between gold and bitcoin has been trending upward since early December and is now near it\u2019s highest point in almost a year.Important to note that the correlation is still less than 0.15, which in practical terms means there isn\u2019t any meaningful correlation. That didn\u2019t stop a drunk panel, myself included, from discussing it along with several of crypto\u2019s top topics, yesterday on BlockTV. You can catch the recording of that fun at this link.Bitcoin Technical AnalysisThe major cryptos have been flashing bright red, with some minor losses over the last few days. Some of the lower tier cryptos have seen parabolic gains on low liquidity but overall I\u2019d say that this market is at a bit of a crossroads.Of course it all boils down to bitcoin and the great descending trendline that has been looming over this market throughout the crypto winter. Now, every chartist will draw this line a bit differently but no matter how you cut it, it\u2019s pretty clear that we\u2019re testing this major barrier as we speak.A strong break above this line could be the definitive end to the cold that we\u2019ve been anticipating.

Following recent research and criticism of CMC\u2019s data collection methods, a New York-based alternative has stepped into the fray.Bitcoin Trading Volume OverexaggeratedCoinMarketCap has, for a long time now, been the go-to place for all kinds of cryptocurrency metrics. In fact, it is a top-500 website globally.Initially, as the name suggests, it listed cryptocurrency prices, ranked on their total market capitalization. The problems arose when it began ranking exchanges based on daily trading volume \u2013 as reported by the exchanges themselves.An exchange which ranked highly could command increased token listing fees; after all, who wouldn\u2019t want their token to be exposed to all that traffic. So it was beneficial for an exchange to report higher volume than it actually processed, through wash-trading or simple misreporting lying.As a result, according to CMC data, 15% of Bitcoin\u2019s entire market cap changed hands in the last 24 hours. As it does every day.Uncovering Fraudulent Exchange VolumesThe fightback against these volumes began with reports from the Blockchain Transparency Institute (BTI). Through a continually developing methodology, the Institute highlighted ever increasing evidence of wash trading. In December, it detected fake volume in 70% of the top 10 exchanges listed on CMC, with actual volume being less than 1% of that reported in some cases.Then last week, in a presentation to the SEC, Bitwise claimed that 95% of reported volume was fake. This led CMC to admit that concerns are \u2018valid\u2019, and announce a forthcoming set of tools to increase transparency.New \u2018Real 10\u2019 Metric Filters Fake VolumeHowever, NY-based metrics and data provider, Messari may have beaten CMC to the punch. They this week added a \u2018Real 10\u2019 volume metric to their OnChainFX dashboard. This gives a daily trading volume figure based on only the ten exchanges Bitwise found not to fake volume.Also, announced, although not yet added to OnChainFX, is a \u2018Liquid Market Cap\u2019 metric. This addresses another concern recently reported by Bitcoinist, that of CMC\u2019s Bitcoin market dominance statistic. Whilst CMC give no weight to daily traded volume (as well it shouldn\u2019t considering the amount of fake volume it reports), a metric considering both market cap and volume is a very useful benchmark.So Is It Time To Update Our Browser Favorites?Maybe. Whilst far from perfect, Messari\u2019s OnChainFX dashboard seems like a very useful resource, and we have no idea how long CoinMarketCap will keep us waiting for its improved tools.Certainly, it goes to back up Bitwise\u2019s claim that:The real market for bitcoin is significantly smaller, more orderly, and more regulated than is commonly understood.However, ignoring all volume outside of the ten \u2018genuine volume\u2019 exchanges doesn\u2019t give us the full picture. The work of the Blockchain Transparency Institute gave an estimate for the the amount of genuine volume, even for suspicious exchanges.The vast majority of false-reporting exchanges had over 95% of their volume which was fake. Although some, such as Huobi and HitBTC, had genuine volumes of around 25% that which they reported. Perhaps BTI are hard at work on a live ranking system of their own, which includes the genuine volume ratio at even dodgy exchanges.Or perhaps we\u2019ll just have to use the best tools available to us at any one time. For now, it would seem that is no longer CoinMarketCap.Will you still be checking CoinMarketCap after the fake bitcoin trading volume debacle or switching to alternatives?

An initial launch is scheduled within the next two months, Dolder and Kessel representing the first wave of takers before further merchants appear on Inapay later in the year.

With the bear market now lasting longer than any other in Bitcoin\u2019s history, tendencies have shifted from spending to storing and accumulating coins. This, research has shown, runs in line with the bull-bear cycles which have characterized Bitcoin markets since its inception.As such, potential uptake for luxury suites and classic cars \u2013 including Ferrari but not Lamborghini in Kessler\u2019s case \u2013 may yet be limited as Bitcoin hovers around $4000 and Ethereum at $135, the latter down over 90 percent against its all-time highs.Nevertheless, Crypto Valley remains a hive of growth.

So I\u2019d like to break a few things down for you. The findings of the report have changed my personal perception of the crypto market in a profound way. To fully understand this, we need to look past the headline.According to the report, 95% of bitcoin volumes reported by crypto exchanges are fake. This is known as wash trading and it is illegal in most regulated exchanges.Thanks to Bitwise and several similar recent reports, this issue is now being addressed. In an interview with Bloomberg, CoinMarketCap.com has now acknowledged the issue and say they\u2019re working on bringing more clarity to their site.Meanwhile, Messari Crypto has already added a new column to their site showing the total volume on the 10 exchanges that bitwise found to be clean. They call it the \u201cReal 10.\u201dThe key here is that all this wash trading that\u2019s been discovered hasn\u2019t actually affected the price of bitcoin itself in any meaningful way. In fact, if we focus only on the real 10 exchanges, we can see that this market is much more robust than previously perceived.Of the real 10 exchanges who are providing most of the liquidity in this market, 9 of them are regulated and the price of bitcoin is extremely consistent among them. The fact that the price is derived directly from the market and that there\u2019s a very low level of arbitrage between the top exchanges means that the market is even less susceptible to manipulation.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsSweet NothingsArgentia Takes BitcoinCrypto Rally Coming inPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of March 27th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsStocks rose this morning as Mario Draghi whispered sweet nothings into investors ears. At an event in Frankfurt, the ECB President claimed that Europe is on track to meet their inflation targets and that the recent downturn in global growth is more of a \u2018soft patch\u2019 that won\u2019t necessarily develop into a full-on recession.The ECB remains \u201caccommodative\u201d and could even delay raising rates even further if needed.However, as even Draghi has previously stated, the effect of central bank actions do tend to wear off over time. Case in point, Draghi\u2019s speech did seem to hold up the markets, but already we can see them turning red just a few short hours after he left the building.Argentina Bitcoin BetYou gotta love Tim Draper. The bitcoin enthusiast and venture capitalist reportedly met with the President of Argentina yesterday to advocate a greater integration of bitcoin with the national economy.The two even made a joke bet on the price of bitcoin versus the Argentinian Peso. If Draper losses, he will double the investment he\u2019s making in the country, but if he wins, Argentina needs to adopt bitcoin as the country\u2019s national, currency.Argentina is rapidly becoming one of the most bitcoin-friendly nations on the planet. Last month CoinDesk published an article with the following headline, clearly displaying the countries enthusiasm for all things crypto.In addition, the state has recently started accepting bitcoin to pay for public transportation. Though there is an ample number of local exchanges in the country and it is easy to buy crypto, we can see that the level of peer to peer transactions on localbitcoins.com is rising steadily.Crypto RallyThat\u2019s about it for today.

The research goes into details to determine the major challenges the network would have to face if it starts scaling. Bitcoin Lightning Node Operators Face ChallengesA research published by BitMEX Research on March 27th called The Lightning Network (Part 2) \u2013 Routing Fee Economics examines the challenges that Lightning node operators would face if the network starts to scale.The paper argues that it is traditional financial conditions that would have a greater impact on Lightning network fees, rather than the technical aspects of its routing problems.According to the study, the low barriers to entry into the Lightning network fees market could mean that the balance would favor users and low fees instead of investment returns for the liquidity providers.This balance between ensuring the network has low fees for users, while also ensuring fees are high enough to incentivize liquidity providers, is likely to be a significant issue.The Lightning Network has two types of fees. The first one is the base fee which charges a fixed amount each time a payment is routed through the channel. There is also the Liquidity Provider Fee, which charges a percentage on the value of the payment.Hence, according to BitMEX, Lightning node operators will have to face a number of challenges.They would have to look for poorly connected Lightning nodes with high payment demand, monitor and rebalance channels to guarantee there is enough two-way liquidity, analyze the fee market not only for the network, but also for high-demand and low-capacity routes, which are targeted, and so forth.The report outlines that there are currently no automated systems capable of handling the above and that this might require the setup of specialized businesses to provide liquidity for LN.\u2018Almost\u2019 1% Annualized ReturnThe study also outlines that BitMEX research were able to make an annualized investment return of \u201calmost\u201d 1 percent based on the most profitable fee bucket by running a Lightning node.Yet, concerns stem out from investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency space:A 1% investment yield may seem attractive in the current low yield environment, however the Lightning network may initially have difficulty attracting the right commercial liquidity providers. Investors in this space are typically looking for a high risk high return investment, which appears to be the opposite end of the spectrum for the relatively low risk low return investment on offer for Lightning liquidity providers.The Bitcoin lightning node count has grown rapidly over the past year. It currently has 7657 modes, while the channels number 39,343, according to LN monitoring resource 1ML.com. The network has a capacity of 1,048 BTC or about $4.2 million USD.Would these findings motivate you to run a Bitcoin Lightning node?

At press time, the pair was trading around $4070 on some major exchanges, corresponding to daily gains of 2.9 percent. The uptick takes BTC above territory which had proven stubborn to crack in recent days after it lost its previous footing above $4000 March 25. The downturn had given rise to warnings that further dips were likely, part of an overall bearish near-term scenario for Bitcoin which, some say, could take BTC/USD as low as $1000.

No Let-Up For Long-Term BullsBeyond the short term, however, industry opinion on Bitcoin specifically remains buoyant. Adding to the list of bulls this week, venture capital firm Pantera Capital highlighted next\u2019s year block reward halving event as a date to watch for holders.The company noted the impact of previous halving events on price, with upward moves coming roughly a year prior to the halving itself.This, it says, suggests the next U-turn should happen in June this year, prior to the halving in May 2020. \u201cWe have seen a couple of these cycles where the tide begins to shift roughly a year in advance of these dates. Inflection points occurred 376 and 320 days prior to the 2012 and 2016 \u2018halvings\u2019, respectively,\u201d a blog post reads. Taking their average of 348 days could indicate a bottom on June 10, 2019. The vertical lines below indicate block reward halving dates and the circles represent past and possible future inflection points.Pantera was not alone. As Bitcoinist reported, market analyst PlanB this week shared similar forecasts, with a prediction model leveraging stock-to-flow (SF) ratio giving a post-halving price of $55,000 per bitcoin some time in 2020-2021. Such a figure would be handy for the industry\u2019s increasingly-prominent advocates publicly staking their belief in a giant Bitcoin price becoming reality within a matter of years. Beyond John McAfee\u2019s infamous $1 million bet with himself, investor Tim Draper this week entered the fray, reportedly wagering on the Bitcoin price versus the national currency of Argentina \u2013 with the country\u2019s president.

Let\u2019s take a closer look at the BTC price action to determine if there is a sign of sustaining the $4k price point for the rest of the week.4-HOUR CHARTLooking a the 4-hour chart, we can see that Bitcoin price broke back through the weekly open of $3978 early on Wednesday morning on roughly the same volume, which brought price down to $3850 earlier in the week.This was fairly important development, because as we mentioned earlier in the week, $3800 is the Monthly open and as such, the bulls need to defend this price point until Sunday to record a second consecutive green candle and avoid a rather nasty doji monthly close on Sunday evening.Since then, BTC/USD has been consolidating above $4k. In order to confirm that the bulls mean business, there will need to be another attempt to break across the monthly high of $4050, or risk recording a lower high, which would confirm that the bears are in control.The MACD is currently above zero but is printing lower high on the histogram, suggesting that there will need to be a retest of yesterday\u2019s breakout.ORDER BOOK ANALYSISLooking at the order book, we can see that there remains a large order block of short interest at $4050, which can be visualized by the yellow block above price. This has effectively helped serve as a barrier to higher prices for the entire of March.WEEKLY CHART Looking at the weekly chart, we can see that Bitcoin price is now trading outside of the 20-week moving average, which has acted as resistance through the entirety of the bear market.Mondays lows of $3850, which subsequently saw a rejection, was effectively a back test of the 20-week moving average \u2013 an encouraging development.The weekly Mac D histogram is putting in a healthy seventh consecutive higher high, illustrating the extent to which the bearish momentum has declined.The OBV, which combines price and volume, shows that there has also been a trend change, printing a breakout of the down trend for the first time since Jan 2018. This is also encouraging although overall volume is decreasing as price has been increasing \u2013 and this can be seen as a bearish divergence.The Bollinger bands are also rapidly contracting at a rate of around 10% per, suggesting a bigger move being in the works. Its outcome will answer the question as to whether BTC is merely witnessing a bearish consolidation before more downside to test the mid $2000s, or if we are seeing a more significant bottom for Bitcoin and the crypto currency market.What Happens NextIn summary, the bounce back in price to retest the $4k level is encouraging for the bulls. But the market is awaiting an injection of volume to dictate the next directional move, which is getting closer with the monthly close looming.For the bulls, a break through $4050 will open the door to higher prices and is really a minimum place that the bulls need to find price at the end of the week, whereas the bears will see a victory being a weekly close at or below $3800.Trade Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

This makes the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist a completely different animal compared to the ever-expanding money supply of today. Since Bitcoin\u2019s supply is fixed \u2013 it doesn\u2019t fit into the existing fiat paradigm, according to the CME chairman.\u201cHow do we figure out how to get the cryptos in there, but just have them backed up by fiat, and let that work as it is,\u201d said Duffy in an interview at FIA\u2019s International Futures Industry Conference in Florida earlier this month.CME Gets Some Use Out of BitcoinHowever, it is precisely this stark contrast as hard money that makes Bitcoin so appealing, particularly as a long-term investment. But approving a Bitcoin ETF, for example, would be too big of a leap, according to Duffy.It would essentially be a nod to an alternative monetary system that could undermine both Wall Street and regulators \u2013 who continue keeping Bitcoin at an arm\u2019s length.But one would think that the executive of a trading platform whose Bitcoin-related product is seeing increasing interest would be a bit more supportive of this new technology. Not so.In fact, he believes the cryptocurrency space should be more focused on utility rather than price speculation.Once you get the use of it, the price will take care of itself. But the argument has gone only to the price of say bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. No one is talking about, \u2018How do I use this asset?\u2019Ironically, the bitcoin futures on the CME are settled in cash. Therefore, traders on his platform literally bet on the price of bitcoin in dollars.Stablecoins Are the Horse-Drawn Automobile of MoneyFollowing Duffy\u2019s arguments we come back full circle to the US dollar. So it\u2019s no surpise the executive is a fan of stablecoins (backed by the USD), in particular. These hold more promise than standalone cryptocurrencies, he argues, as these assets are more useful in today\u2019s financial framework. \u201cThe governments can\u2019t run unless they can run on a deficit,\u201d explains Duffy. I am trying to figure out why they would say, \u2018Sounds good to me, because I want to be responsible and run everything on even-for-even basis. I can\u2019t borrow against anything.\u2019Wait\u2026 isn\u2019t the whole point of Bitcoin is that we no longer need to trust central banks *not* to mess with our money?Anonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, explained this in a 2009 forum post:The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that\u2019s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically. But they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.The Dollar is Already a BankCoinDuffy\u2019s arguments also beg another question: what incentive would investors have to adopt \u2018cryptocurrencies\u2019 pegged to the US dollar since they\u2019re ultimately just a digital dollar in a \u2018crypto\u2019 wrapper? What problem do \u2018bankcoins\u2019 solve when 92 percent of global money is already digital?Ultimately, the CME chairman\u2019s position is understandable. He\u2019s merely protecting his interests despite appearing not to understand the technology he\u2019s already benefitting from.Unfortunately, for the gatekeepers, however, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t care, and will continue flying right over their heads.What do you think of the CEM chairman\u2019s comments?

This will bring the total crypto cross pairs to 44, providing our investors with even more diversification options and investment choices. The new pairs include major currencies from four different continents and six leading cryptocurrencies. CanadaCryptocurrencies have become extremely popular in Canada recently. Both traders and exchanges have grown in number, with Canadians afforded plenty of access to US exchanges as well. Fiat pairs, like the BTC/CAD and ETC/CAD, are among the most popular financial assets among Canadians right now. Canadian authorities have increased digital currency regulation and oversight over the last several years.The new eToro fiat pairs for this region are: BTC/CAD, ETH/CAD, XRP/CAD, ETC/CAD, BCH/CAD, LTC/CADEuropeDue to its monolithic size, the European Union can often be slow to adapt new rules and regulations to the constantly changing global markets. Thus, cryptocurrencies remain in a state of uncertainty, unregulated by ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority). This could change soon, with calls from leading political figures to clamp down on the crypto market with new harmonised regulation. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Swiss Franc is widely available for crypto cross pairs, including the ETH/CHF and BCH/CHF.The new eToro fiat pairs for this region are: BTC/CHF, ETH/CHF, XRP/EUR, XRP/CHF, XRP/GBP, ETC/EUR, ETC/GBP, ETC/CHF, BCH/EUR, BCH/GBP, BCH/CHF, LTC/EUR, LTC/GBP, LTC/CHFAustralia and New ZealandUnlike Canada and Europe, some countries in the Oceanic region are far more lenient when it comes to cryptocurrencies. The Australian government does not consider cryptocurrencies a legal form of electronic currency, allowing them to overlook many of the regulations and legal requirements that govern similar financial assets in the country. Some of the new Australian Dollar pairs include ETH/AUD and ETC/AUD. New Zealand is a different matter. While they are in close proximity, the two countries do not share the same outlook on cryptocurrencies. The New Zealand authorities treat crypto like any other currency, both in terms of regulation and taxation. There are plenty of NZD pairs to choose from, such as the BTC/NZD and the BCH/NZD.The new eToro fiat pairs for this region are: BTC/AUD, BTC/NZD, ETH/AUD, ETH/NZD, XRP/AUD, XRP/NZD, ETC/AUD, ETC/NZD, BCH/AUD, BCH/NZD, LTC/AUD, LTC/NZDJapanPerhaps the most interesting scenario for cryptocurrencies can be found in Japan. The Japanese government has granted the cryptocurrency community self-regulatory status, effectively allowing the industry to police itself. This makes trading the ETC/JPY and the LTC/JPY easy and convenient. Japan recognises cryptocurrencies as legal tender.The new eToro fiat pairs for this region are: ETC/JPY, BCH/JPY, LTC/JPYMore Options and More OpportunitiesOur goal of providing additional fiat pairs on the eToro platform is part of our overall strategy of constantly increasing financial opportunities for our traders.

Lowest Bitcoin Volatility on RecordBitcoin is on the verge of recording its least volatile month, according to a report by Marketwatch. Citing Dow Jones market data, the report outlines that the monthly trading range of Bitcoin price for the month of March is at 7.8 percent.Prior to that, the tightest monthly trading range for BTC/USD since the start of 2017 was 21.2 percent, while the average monthly trading range since October 2013 is 53.7 percent.Commenting on the matter was popular cryptocurrency analyst Murad Mahmudov, who outlined:Volatility is in itself a neutral signal. Historically, however, low-volatility periods in BTC have always preceded prolonged bull runs, especially after capitulation moments of high momentum as seen in November and December.Nevertheless, it\u2019s also worth noting that Mahmudov has previously said that he expects \u201cno bull run till Q2 2020.\u201dBottom Q2 2019No Bull Run till Q2 2020\u2014 Murad Mahmudov \ud83d\ude80 (@MustStopMurad) February 10, 2019He\u2019s also put a price range for Bitcoin\u2019s bottom in the $1700 \u2013 $2400 area.Not Everyone AgreesBitcoin\u2019s high volatility has historically been pointed out as one of its main weaknesses. Yet, not everyone agrees. According to the CEO & co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange BitMex, volatility is actually a much-needed quality for Bitcoin.Back in 2018, he said:You want as much volatility as possible to have as much chance that Bitcoin goes to $50,000, $100,000, $1,000,000, whatever that high number is.\u2018Crypto Spring\u2019 a Time of VolatilityIn any case, Bitcoin has managed to bounce back upwards of $4,000 on Wednesday. As Bitcoinist reported, this was an important development because it signals that bulls are defending the $3,800 monthly open price point.Also commenting on Bitcoin\u2019s move above $4,000 was Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, who explained, saying:We can\u2019t go from [crypto] winter to summer in a few days, probably not even in a few weeks. Spring is generally a time of volatility where hot and cold often surprise us.

The best part of the news? Zebpay claim that it will even pay the fees for Lightning transactions made through its wallet.The Inexorable Advance Of Lightning NetworkDespite its \u2018still very much experimental\u2019 nature, Lightning Network is growing fast, and its integration into mainstream services continues. The announcement from Malta-based Zebpay, once India\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, claims to mark the first acceptance of LN payments by a major exchange.Available through web, iOS, and Android apps, customers worldwide can now use BTC wallet balances to make Lightning transactions. Zebpay particularly emphasises using the service for purchases at Lightning enabled retailers, claiming users can:buy virtually anything by identifying the store, copying or scanning the invoice of the product or service, and finalizing the payment \u2014 all within milliseconds.The (Already Low) Fees Are On ZebpayLightning Network payments have significantly lower fees than standard Bitcoin payments, but users won\u2019t even have to pay these. In line with its \u2018Setting Crypto Free\u2019 mission statement:Zebpay would bear the transaction cost for all lightning transactions done from its walletThis is not without limits, of course. Users can make up to 10 transactions per day, of amounts from 1 satoshi up to 0.001 BTC (around $4 at current rates). Whilst this may seem like a minuscule sum, LN is still in testing and isn\u2019t recommended for larger payment amounts. Current use-cases are also largely geared towards micro-transactions well within this limit.Zebpay also advertises \u2018Zero-Fee Trading\u2019 on the exchange side of its business. According to CEO, Ajeet Khurana:we believe that crypto empowers investors and allows anyone to control their own financial destinies. By offering zero-fee trading, we act on our mission to liberate crypto from the shackles of trading fees, and to reduce the friction for all those who are new to cryptoAfter launching in 2014, Zebpay rose to become the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in India.

At press time, GLXY was trading at around $2.50, a 4.6 percent rise on the day and increasingly towards its annual high of $3.18.By contrast, November saw shares hit a low of just $0.89, part of the knock-on effect of the Bitcoin market downturn, which saw the cryptocurrency lose almost half its value during that month. A short-lived bull run November 28 failed to restore sentiment immediately, Galaxy seeing further losses before an abrupt U-turn began this year. Now, both the bank and CEO Novogratz are receiving admiration from analysts, who note the upturn in performance came directly after he increased his stake in the company to 80 percent.Galaxy, they note, is one of the best-performing cryptocurrency traders, despite not even having an in-house cryptocurrency token.What Bear Market?The turnaround comes as Galaxy pushes forward with investment plans despite the sluggish pace of cryptocurrency markets more generally. In an extensive interview with TechCrunch this week, co-founder Mike Engelbert was predictably buoyant about the future, noting business expansion was likewise continuing.\u201cOur investment business is our biggest business by far,\u201d he told the publication. Our trading business is growing quickly, even through a downturn in the market, though it\u2019s really taking the longest to stand up as any trading business would.Given that in November, Galaxy\u2019s trading losses totaled almost $140 million, Engelbert did not discount the likelihood of more pain in the future.\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely see more as this technology continues to develop. We\u2019re still a ways away from it being the seamless technology we enjoy with the web,\u201d he said. But it\u2019s probably not all that different from what we lived through the last time around, where a few companies become massively important and a lot of them don\u2019t.Onwards And Upwards With Bitcoin?Novogratz has also upped his steadfast faith in bitcoin price in recent weeks. Speaking in various interviews, he highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s future utility as \u2018digital gold,\u2019 as well as speaking vaguely about price performance by 2020.On the latter topic, he is less stridently bullish than other major crypto investment moguls such as Tim Draper but still believes upside is easily achievable through this year. \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of hit an equilibrium in this $3400 \u2013 $3600 zone,\u201d he said in February. Could it go down? Of course, it could; all markets could go either way, but it feels like we\u2019re\u2026 grinding along at the bottom and the next move will be significantly higher.As Bitcoinist reported, not everyone has since agreed, fresh warnings this week appearing that volume signs indicate a retracing below $4000 for Bitcoin is imminent. Closing the month below $3800, one analyst added, would cement the likelihood of more bearish behavior.What do you think about Galaxy Digital\u2019s performance?

Blockchain solutions in each of these areas continue to attract significant investment. However, there is one use case for blockchain which has the potential to trump all others \u2013 gaming.Gaming is already a double-digit growth sector, with a global market value of nearly $135 billion in 2018. Fortnite is currently one of the most popular games worldwide, with 200 million players. Gaming channels feature heavily among the top influencers on YouTube, with heavyweight gaming vlogger PewDiePie clocking up over 90 million subscribers.Blockchain technology is making strides, but it still needs a killer app to appeal to a mass user base. However, blockchain has much to offer the gaming industry.Is Gaming Blockchain\u2019s Killer App?As gaming becomes more high-stakes, with users investing serious cash into their online profiles, account theft is becoming more prevalent. Hackers have been reportedly stealing accounts from games such as League of Legends, with the goal of selling the accounts online to others who prize the accrued in-game assets. Blockchain offers the potential for immutable ownership of unique digital assets, making it an attractive proposition for game developers.Although blockchain games are among the most popular decentralized applications, scalability has been a barrier for developers. Games typically require a high transaction throughput, and Ethereum has struggled to live up to the job ever since the mania around CryptoKitties strangled the network back at the end of 2017. Newer blockchains such as EOS and Tron are addressing the scalability challenge, opening up the possibilities for dApp game developers.Therefore, it\u2019s hardly surprising, that the convergence of blockchain and gaming is now attracting significant investment. Here, we look at three separate instances where investors are betting big on blockchain gaming.Ripple/ForteRipple has made its name predominantly in the financial sector; however the company also has an investment arm, called Xpring. Xpring is partnering with Forte, a blockchain gaming company founded in February by executives from the gaming industry and backed by big names such as Andreesson Horowitz and Coinbase Ventures. The partnership between Xpring and Forte launches a joint plan to help integrate blockchain into the gaming industry.As part of the plan, Forte will oversee a $100 million fund, held in XRP and released to game developers or designers for incorporating Ripple blockchain services into existing games which have over 50k daily users.The move represents an opportunity for Ripple to expand its offerings beyond messaging software for the finance sector. Forte will be using Ripple technology, including the Interledger protocol which enables transactions across different blockchains. A smart contract service called Codius will also be available.Mangrove Capital/DreamTeamMangrove Capital is a Luxembourg-based venture fund with team members who have previously been involved in successful tech startups such as Skype and Wix. Late last year, the company announced it was putting a $5 million investment into DreamTeam, a blockchain-based all-in-one eSports platform.For the uninitiated, eSports is the billion-dollar industry of professional gaming. Competitors from different teams or leagues compete professionally in games such as Counter-Strike. Gameplay is streamed in real-time to fans all over the world. For this reason, the eSports industry is growing fast, as ever more brands and sponsors look to capitalize on the marketing potential.The founders of DreamTeam recognized that there\u2019s a gap in the eSports market for a platform that connects a fragmented industry and helps to reduce incidences of fraud and non-payments. DreamTeam will serve as a gateway for connecting the various players, leagues, agents, sponsors and tournament operators. Their DREAM token will also be used to receive the advertised prize money when winning these tournaments.The eSports market is set for rapid further growth, with revenues forecast to reach $1.65 billion by 2021. Therefore, it\u2019s easy to see why Mangrove has chosen to invest in a company like DreamTeam, which is aiming to corner this burgeoning section of the gaming market.TronLast year, Tron announced that it was establishing a blockchain game fund called Tron Arcade. The fund aims to build the foundation for a blockchain gaming ecosystem on the Tron platform, with Tron providing up to $100 million in funding over the next three years.The Tron Arcade website points to the potential of tapping into engaged users and the limited selection of dApp games currently available. The fund is aimed at providing developers with distribution, funding, advice, and potential access to partnerships through the Tron network.Tron is making rapid headway among dApp platforms, with fast transaction speeds of up to 2,000 tps. Founder Justin Sun is ambitious about his vision, which is for Tron to \u201cdecentralize the web.\u201d This vision was a driving force behind Tron\u2019s acquisition of peer-to-peer filesharing service BitTorrent for $150 million. According to its blog, the Tron Foundation is also venturing into other blockchain use cases including charity, consumer internet, and social media.Bottom LineThe double-digit growth of the gaming sector shows no signs of slowing. However, the convergence of blockchain and gaming could be a massive turning point, enabling even more significant growth in the future. The influx of investment capital from the big blockchain platforms and venture funds certainly seems to indicate that we can expect far more to come from this combination."}

Long Vuong, founder of TomoChain (TOMO) has fired back with some criticism of his own.TomoChain Offers 1,000TPS Compared to Ethereum\u2019s Double DigitsThe TomoChain network aims at being a public EVM-compatible blockchain with faster and cheaper transaction fees, among other features and promises. Except it isn\u2019t all just hot air. Their network already boasts transaction speeds of 1,000TPS\u2013compared to Ethereum\u2019s double digits.Vuong recently stuck the knife into Ethereum, saying:There are trade-offs in most systems. But Vitalik won\u2019t be the one who makes the call about what\u2019s trash and what isn\u2019t.He then twisted it a little further, adding:This year won\u2019t be a good one for Ethereum\u2026 Vitalik and Ethereum are in a difficult place. On one hand, they are disrespected by the Bitcoin maximalist camp, on the other they cannot seem to solve performance issues efficiently.TomoChain Fights Back at VitalikVitalik came out at the Blockchain Connect conference earlier this year stating that many projects that claim high transaction speeds are more centralized than the Ethereum network. In fact, he criticized them, saying:A lot of the time when a blockchain project claims it can do 3,500TPS because it has a different algorithm, what it really means is \u2018we\u2019re a centralized pile of trash\u2019.Vuong took exception.He highlighted TomoChain\u2019s already impressive transaction speeds at 1000TPS, 150-plus master nodes, and lower fees to boot. TomoChain\u2019s mainnet launched in December 2018 and has been slowly gathering traction. Vuong firmly believes that his Singapore and Vietnam-based company can provide a viable solution for Ethereum\u2019s scalability woes.Ethereum Contracts Can Easily Transition to TomoChainTomoChain is certainly an interesting prospect, centralized piece of trash or no. It already features 150 masternodes, with a Proof-of-Stake voting consensus method, low fees, and almost instant transaction confirmation. More importantly, TomoChain is Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible (EVM). This means that contracts written in Ethereum can be ported to TomoChain without friction. This could give struggling ETH DApp developers another way of bringing their projects over the finish line. Since its well-publicized scaling issues, many ETH DApps are practically inactive with 93% of them reporting zero transactions in 24 hours last week.

The newest version of the \u2018decentralized\u2019 peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptographic ledger for XRP storage will boast the automatic detection of censorship attempts in addition to the automatic issuance of warnings. Explains the official announcement:One of the major benefits of decentralized blockchain technologies, such as the XRP Ledger, is censorship resistance. Already highly resistant to censorship attempts, with the release of version 1.2.0 of the XRP Ledger, servers now have the ability to automatically detect transaction censorship attempts and issue warnings of increasing severity for transactions that a server believes should have been included in a closed ledger after several rounds of consensus.XRP Ledger version 1.2.0 will also implement the MultisignReverse Amendment. This will lower the reserve requirement for signer lists for Multisign.Additionally, the code has seen \u201cincremental improvements\u201d for the handling of offers in the decentralized exchange.Those running an XRP Ledger server are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.0 by Feb 27, 2019. Failure to do so will result in the server becoming \u201camendment blocked.\u201d According to the announcement, these blocked servers:Cannot determine the validity of a ledger; Cannot submit or process transactions; Cannot participate in the consensus process; Cannot vote on future amendments; and Could rely on potentially invalid data.Stiff CompetitionRipple is currently experiencing a healthy dose of FUD following the announcement from JPMorgan Chase that the major financial institution would be launching its own in-house cryptocurrency, JPM Coin.The announcement from JPMorgan has led many to view Ripple\u2019s XRP as merely a test-case for major banks to create their own blockchain-based solutions \u2014 something Bitcoinist suggested in March 2018 when we wrote:So even though global networks like SWIFT may be technologically inferior to RippleNet, for example, the XRP token would simply not be needed because supranational institutions and governments certainly will \u2014and some already are \u2014 issue their own tokens to maintain full control over their monetary systems.What do you think about the update to XRP Ledger?

The aggrieved brokers say the restrictive law is preventing anyone from participating in the market.Stifling the Bitcoin Futures Trading ArenaAccording to The Jakarta Post, the Futures Exchange Supervisory Board (Bappebti) of the Indonesian Trade Ministry issued regulations to govern cryptocurrency futures trading in the country. Among these laws are minimum capital requirements for cryptocurrency futures traders and brokers.Article 8, paragraph 1 of the regulations stipulate that crypto futures brokerage firms require a minimum paid-up capital of 1 trillion rupiah ($71.7 million). Also, article 24, paragraph 3 of the same set of regulations require Bitcoin futures traders to hold a minimum of 100 billion rupiah ($7.17 million), out of which the law mandates a minimum deposit of 80 billion ruppiah ($5.73 million).Stakeholders in the industry say the transferred capital requirements far exceed those stipulated for futures trading in mainstream asset classes.Speaking to Reuters, Oscar Darmawan, the CEO of Indodax, a cryptocurrency exchange platform compared the capital requirements to that of mainstream futures contracts which stands at 2.5 billion rupiah ($179,000).Back in mid-2018, Bitcoinist reported that Bappebti was legitimizing virtual currencies by classifying them as commodities. While the need to offer consumer protection is legitimate, a 40,000 percent dichotomy in capital requirement for cryptos and mainstream commodities futures trading is seen by industry commentators as excessive.According to Darmawan, these regulations are counterproductive to the growth of the virtual currency industry. Reports indicate there haven\u2019t been any transactions in the Indonesian cryptocurrency futures trading market to date.Weekly Bitcoin Trading Volume Reaches New HeightsMeanwhile, BTC trading volume in Indonesia is currently on the rise.Data from Coin Dance shows that Indonesians traded 102 BTC via Localbitcoins for the week ending February 9, 2019. This figure represents the country\u2019s largest weekly trading volume beating the previous record of 43 BTC set in early October 2016.In terms of the rupiah, the new weekly BTC trading volume stands at 4.5 billion rupiah.

And in what\u2019s been an ongoing saga for Bitcoin Max, cryptocurrency exchanges everywhere are celebrating small victories. Bitcoin Max had its account closed for the first time back in August last year by Santander Bank. But the institution was forced to reopen the exchange\u2019s accounts due to an injunction granted by the court.In the first hearing, according to Portal do Bitcoin, Judge Ana Catarino denied the motion of Bitcoin Max to reopen its account, stating that it was up to the banking institution if it wished to deny services or not:The closing of the account is a faculty of the banking institution, according to the norm established in article 10 of Resolution 2,025 / 93 of the Central Bank of Brazil.But Santander Bank Never Wrote a NoticeThe motion against Bitcoin Max at the time led to the company\u2019s lawyer Leonardo Ranna to plead an injunction. Ever since then, the cryptocurrency exchange has been battling it out to keep its checking account open.It seems that the original ruling against Bitcoin Max in favor of Santander was actually an error. The judge did not realize that Santander had failed to provide Bitcoin Max with any prior formal written notice. This is illegal in Brazil.According to the same resolution of the Central Bank mentioned above, a bank can only terminate an account holder\u2019s account by providing: prior written communication of the intention to terminate the contract.Santander Bank failed to do this. Small Victory for Cryptocurrency ExchangesThat Santander was forced to keep Bitcoin Max\u2019s account open by the Justice system is a small victory for cryptocurrency exchanges. However, it was down to a loophole, rather than a wider movement of banks starting to work with cryptocurrency companies in Brazil.Bitcoin Max also filed for compensation for the moral damages that the whole ordeal had had on its business. This was denied and the judge ruled that the claims were unfounded.This is not the first case to come to court between cryptocurrency companies and banks in Brazil. And it likely won\u2019t be the last. Bitcoin Market and Banco Ita\u00fa found themselves in a similar situation previously.Bitcoin Max\u2019s lawyer Ranna said that the court ruling had failed to consider \u201cthe banks\u2019 orchestrated operation to cancel the accounts of all companies operating crypto-coins.\u201d Something he claims should be taken into account.This also makes the Bitcoin Max victory somewhat bittersweet. They may have won the battle, but the war still rages on. Santander had to keep the account open because the forgot to send a letter, not because Brazilian regulators have applied any pressure on banks to work with companies in this emerging field.Will the exchange eventually find itself without a banking partner?

Drawing analogies to a supercharged dot-com boom-and-bust cycle, he predicted future growth to a price of $250,000.Coin WarsWe may be currently experiencing crypto-winter, hodling together for warmth, but Mark Jeffery thinks this should not be surprising. The early Bitcoin-pioneer was talking on \u2018The Next Billion Seconds\u2019 podcast:I think this is very much like the dot com boom and bust cycle that we saw in the late nineties, early 2000sCertainly, the period in late 2017 was analogous to the early days of the dot-com boom. Eager investors, desperate not to miss out, were remortgaging their homes, just to throw the money at anything that asked.And certainly, when investors realized they were buying into nothing more than a vague promise of something, they panicked.The Market Strikes BackBut Jeffrey suggests that the process has been greatly compressed with cryptocurrency:So in the dot com boom and bust cycle it was about four and a half years, maybe five years. In the crypto world, it was about a year and a half. So it was a lot faster.Just over a year into our crypto-winter, it would be warming to see an end to it within the next six months. Whilst Jeffrey stops short of predicting when it will happen, he is confident that the current \u2018dead\u2019 period will end.But this is not the end of the story. This is the middle part. This is the second act. The third act is return of the Jedi and we\u2019re not there yet.Return Of The BitcoinSo we\u2019re at the end of \u2018Empire\u2019; Bitcoin has lost its hand, and Ethereum has been captured and frozen in carbon.

And Facebook didn\u2019t even exist at the time, appearing having already learned the lessons of the boom-and-bust.The tokens with real value will push through, and who knows what may still appear to become the Facebook of crypto.

Goldman Sachs alumn and Kellogg MBA graduate, Shelly is a recognized expert in the areas of Fintech and Blockchain, and is a sought-after expert at international conferences about Israeli tech investing. She serves as a board member of multiple iAngels portfolio companies.Bitcoinist: Why did the ICO market experience such hype in 2017?Shelly Moyal: This is a loaded question and there are a few things to unpack. First, most emerging technologies experience hype cycles in which excitement gets ahead of the technology but there are a few things that make the ICO boom and bust unique.The two most important differentiators were, 1) the participation of retail investors, and 2) liquidity of the assets (i.e. the ability trade these assets on exchanges). Most hype cycles go unnoticed as they are experienced primarily by venture capitalists and due to illiquidity, implode gradually over several years vs. several months as VCs more easily hide behind book values when market pricing information I unavailable.Before I go into the hype which was driven by a lot of BS and speculation I think it\u2019s important to give the idealistic background that drives the interest in the technology.There is a growing disenchantment of consumers with traditional institutions which are centrally controlled and therefore vulnerable to mismanagement, exploitation, failure and moral hazard.Bitcoin has shown the world that it is possible for a group of strangers to reach consensus without anyone controlling the system. This unique feature \u201cprogrammable trust\u201d has sparked the interest of several academics and entrepreneurs who imagined the possibility of creating numerous applications based on this feature.The most popular project set out to build an infrastructure for such applications is Ethereum. Similar to Bitcoin, the infrastructure is an open source protocol and it is possible to buy into the project by buying its access token Ether. Bitcoin and Ethereum are both early examples where technology meets capital in the sense that you can buy a token both as a user and as an investor, virtually enabling anyone to invest without restrictions.The way protocols (like Ethereum and Bitcoin) incentivize adoption is through their access token which has speculative value. As the network grows, the token appreciates in value.During 2017, the generated wealth of the early Bitcoin and Ethereum investors was readily allocated into additional startups (mostly ICOs) set out to build the ecosystem in pursuit of further capital gains. In turn, hundreds of thousands of people worldwide witnessed how early investors in Bitcoin and Ethereum realized incredible 1,000x+ profits and wanted a piece of it as well.Entrepreneurs started creating protocols and adopted the ICO crowdfunding vehicle to raise millions of dollars of nondilutive capital for their \u201ctoken\u201d startups. With the lack of regulatory guidance and oversight around these tokens as well as the lack of institutional investors balancing price levels around fundamentals, prices were getting way ahead of themselves resulting in a large boom and subsequent bust.Why did it subsequently crash in 2018? Regulatory clampdown? Lower Bitcoin price? Or a combination of factors?The \u201ccrash\u201d was the result of 1) the disillusionment of investors, and 2) the regulatory clampdown.Most of the investment activity was driven by speculation and price movements were influenced by illiquidity and at times, market manipulation. As these projects were all early-stage startups that have not yet created value (a product and network) it was impossible to justify multi-billion dollar valuations.The fact that many projects also turned out to be fraudulent didn\u2019t help, and the high demand for these assets gradually evaporated over the course of 2018.Furthermore, there is no coherent business model for these token investments. In other words, it was (and still is) unclear how value will be captured by the early investors of these networks. Most of the projects today do not have a token model which effectively aligns incentives between users and investors. There is an inverse relationship between velocity and network value.Meaning that the more hands the currency changes, the lower the valuation of the network because if all demand is met by supply there is less scarcity. So a successful product could still result in little value captured by token holders. Many projects today are experimenting with different token models like mint and burn, governance, work tokens, TCRs etc expected to drive appreciation in the token but these are still unproven.Furthermore, as regulators, specifically the SEC, made it clear that most token sales are considered security offerings (according to the Howey test and Hinman\u2019s guidance) and started investigating projects that conducted an ICO, more and more entrepreneurs decided not to pursue the ICO path as they realized their tokens would be considered uncompliant securities.What kind of lessons were learned during the past year? There are no shortcuts to building a startup even if it\u2019s decentralized. It takes time and for that reason, venture capital cannot be entirely replaced. The idea of startups trading in a liquid market is very nice theoretically but there is no reason for any startup that doesn\u2019t have anything aside from a team and an idea to trade at something much more than zero.Even today when startups raise money at a certain valuation, it doesn\u2019t mean that the next day someone would be willing to buy the startup at that price. This pricing is just a mechanism for building partnerships between entrepreneurs and investors, not an indication of real fundamental value.This brings me to another lesson regarding the importance of governance. The lack of self-governance of these startups requires regulation and corporate governance to protect investors and consumers until these networks can truly and fairly govern themselves.During the period between 2017 and 2018, the ability of entrepreneurs to raise money with no strings attached led to massive abuse, which damaged the industry in many ways.Ironically, this created a bad perception of the movement largely set out to build a better world with financial inclusion and more aligned businesses built on the values of fairness, transparency, and decentralization.Why do you believe that the STO can replace the ICO?We don\u2019t believe STOs will replace all ICOs. STO is a broader category. Indeed, decentralized/utility token projects can take advantage of this route too but broadly speaking, STOs are simply an evolution of capital markets allowing us to tokenize any kind of asset. STOs will play an important role in the future economy as they provide infrastructure for trade and reduce inefficiencies in the current financial markets through disintermediation.STOs are exclusively based on their regulatory compliance and vetting. How can this crowdfunding model attract the same amount of people that the relatively permissionless ICO model did?It can not and should not. STOs, by definition, are subject to national securities laws and are thus treated like issuances of traditional securities such as equities and bonds. As a result, the investor universe is restricted and those that choose to market to the general public will be required to comply with heavy and expensive regulation similar to those required by companies wishing to raise an IPO.STOs will thus more likely follow the trends and cycles of the financial instruments underlying tokens rather than those experienced in the recent ICO bubble.How does your company iAngels help these projects to manage their capital?We help them just like we help our other startups across various areas. Investing in startups is a long term partnership and we strive to give our entrepreneurs any support they need whether it\u2019s in business development, fundraising, marketing, finance and/or strategy.What projects have you invested in recently?One interesting project is Spacemesh, which tries to create more fairness through a consensus mechanism: Proof-of-spacetime (PoST). Within PoST, storage space is utilized as proof for the verifier (as opposed to computational power in Proof-of-Work).While nothing stops someone from buying huge amounts of storage space to increase their influence on the consensus, these actors face diseconomies of scale and such behavior is thus not economical. As a result, unused storage space on home computers can contribute to the consensus and if the technology works, the degree of decentralization can be high with low energy costs.Like you mentioned, most of these projects experiment with new token models, building apps on unproven blockchains. Wouldn\u2019t it makes sense to harness the biggest network effect, i.e. Bitcoin rather than try to build their base layer digital value networks from scratch?Yes, definitely. Bitcoin and Ethereum have indeed managed to build strong networks over the years with large developer communities, and there is a lot of room to innovate on the layers above these blockchains. And indeed, over the last year, we have already seen several projects build promising applications on these blockchains, especially Ethereum, for example, Maker Dao and its stablecoin Dai.However, as there are different types of applications, we believe there is no one size fits all blockchain and so there is room for other innovative and novel blockchains (e.g. faster, more secure, more decentralized) that can also emerge as leaders for certain applications.What is the biggest barrier to cryptocurrency adoption right now? We believe that the main barriers are technology and regulation. In terms of technology, the stack is not developed enough to build scalable and user-friendly decentralized applications (dApps). And currently, only tech-savvy people interact with them.Interaction with a dApp, for example, requires you to download the Metamask browser extension, to create a wallet and to fund it with Ether bought through an exchange or broker. This is a lengthy process before you can even interact with a dApp. In order to achieve adoption, the blockchain must operate in a way that is just as seamless as the applications we use today and this will take some time.We are still at a point in which entrepreneurs need to create breakthroughs at the first infrastructure levels of the technology.It will take time until crypto will feel like Visa or Mastercard, which are much higher up in the technology stack. Think of the internet before broadband and mobile, much less useful.In terms of regulation, it is important for entrepreneurs and users to have clarity about the regulatory treatment of these assets, which they don\u2019t have today. As a result, participants in the technology are exposed to potential legal and regulatory proceedings. This veil of uncertainty deters most risk-averse people and institutions from adopting the technology.What are the opportunities in the industry?Today the market has changed and what was possible in 2017 isn\u2019t possible today, so what we are left with is actually what might be the biggest opportunity for the industry today.Talented entrepreneurs and groups are sitting on piles of cash with a lot of time to work and focus on shipping rather than the next VC round. This is a significant advantage given that in VC, entrepreneurs typically raise money for 18 months and if they don\u2019t hit their milestones they\u2019re often out of business.By removing this \u201ctiming risk,\u201d theoretically, a team of talented people has a higher chance of succeeding. If even a few blockchain projects emerge as value adding from this wave, it will be a great win for the industry.What do you think about Shelly\u2019s view on digital token regulations?

However, the two newcomers to the space are looking to unseat the incumbent smart contracts platform, eating away at its market share.Although Ethereum 00 processed over $7.6 billion on-chain through dApps in 2018, the introduction of EOS and Tron saw figures tumble.January 2019 has seen EOS dApps account for a whopping 55% of transaction values, while Tron took 38%. This has left Ethereum with a measly 6% of US dollar volume, between the three platforms.Take A Chance On MeThe key demographic which has led this charge away from Ethereum has been gamblers. Of the $5.5 billion transacted on EOS dApps since launch, 70% has been spent on betting dApps.The figure for Tron is even more extreme, with 95% of transaction volume used for gambling.In contrast, only 2% of USD volume on Ethereum goes towards gambling, despite 47% of available dApps being betting related. The vast majority of Ethereum dApp value goes towards trading on Decentralise Exchanges (DEX). However, Diar notes that DEX volumes have also seen a steady decline since the middle of last year.Not All Bad News For EthereumOn-chain transaction numbers for Ether are actually at an all time high, with several financially driven projects making it their home. It is unsurprising that this does not translate into comparable volumes to gambling dApps, which are inherently high-volume activities.Plus, the migration of gamblers to EOS and Tron has also seen a migration of hackers. EOS 00 particularly has been plagued by security issues, with the EOSBet dApp being hit twice in quick succession. This led to separate losses of $200,000 and $338,000 in EOS tokens.So it seem that, rather than rolling over and dying, Ethereum has been busy growing up. Although EOS reportedly has $1 billion set aside to encourage developers to make the switch to their platform. How that pans out remains to be seen.Why are gamblers moving away from Ethereum to other platforms?

But isn\u2019t that response just reactionary, over-broad and perhaps even a little bit lazy? Canadian messaging company, Kik, are fighting back, and the industry as a whole should be glad that they are.The Promise Of Untold WealthInitial Coin Offerings (or token sales) appeared on the cryptocurrency scene in 2013, with notable offerings from Ethereum (raising $16m) and Stellar ($39m) the following year. They became the darlings of the industry by 2017, allowing unbridled raising of start-up capital, and generally impressive returns for investors.Like all things crypto, ICOs went thermo-nuclear in 2017, as media-frenzy meant everyone wanted a piece of the action. With seemingly not enough pieces to go round, that $hitcoin you just bought at pre-ICO prices could score a ten-fold return, even before launch.Enter the criminals and the woefully under-skilled. Through fraud and/or mismanagement, over half of all ICOs collapsed within four months of the token sale. 2018\u2019s Ethereum price free-fall didn\u2019t help matters either. Somebody needed to act.Saving Every Crypto-investorIn mid-2017, the SEC had issued a balanced and considered report, following investigation into the DAO project. The report warned ICO issuers and investors that securities laws \u2018may\u2019 apply to certain token offerings, DAO included. According to the commission, tokens which promised investors a return were essentially securities, implying that tokens with \u2018utility\u2019 were not.This pretty much made sense to everybody. Selling a token as purely an investment was tantamount to selling company stock or bonds. Whereas a utility token didn\u2019t need to go up in value, as it had other\u2026 um, utility. The fact that so many did was due to the buzz around any novel digital tokens at the time. That didn\u2019t suddenly make these tokens securities.Nobody wanted to see scammers in the space, so the scrutiny of the SEC was generally welcome. But still the speculators flocked, and they expected a return from every new token on the block.They didn\u2019t want the utility of a token, just an asset so they could get rich quick. And when they didn\u2019t, they complained to the SEC\u2026 who weren\u2019t very happy about it. Somebody had to save these idiots from themselves.It started in February 2018, when SEC Chair Jay Clayton asserted that \u201cevery ICO I\u2019ve seen is a security.\u201d By June, Ethereum had distinguished itself as \u2018not-a-security\u2019, joining only Bitcoin as a decentralized cryptocurrency\u2026 although how decentralised is now debatable.Pretty much everything else now fell into the category of securities, and the SEC started proceedings accordingly.Through Kik and KinKik\u2019s first dealings with the SEC over their Kin token were friendly enough. Just a few informal questions. But over time, things ramped up and became more serious until the commission finally issued a Wells notice, outlining why they think there has been a securities infraction.Kik\u2019s defence hinges around the fact that it was sold as, and is in use as, a currency. Currencies being specifically excluded from being securities.Of course, the internet has roundly mocked this, suggesting it is only used in apps, which Kik funded, but the internet is being a dick. By this argument Fortnite V-bucks are a security, as are Amazon vouchers, and perhaps even supermarket loyalty points.\u201cBut,\u201d says the Internet, \u201cdid Pantera and Polychain (who invested millions in the token presale) know that the tokens weren\u2019t expected to make a profit?\u201d with a smug look in its eye.Sadly, we weren\u2019t privy to that conversation. But at the time (Aug 2017), even if they read the white-paper, they likely still expected price to skyrocket, because, you know\u2026 August 2017. That still doesn\u2019t make it a security.But I Heard ICOs Were Already DeadAnd you may well have heard it right here on Bitcoinist, but I respectfully disagree. The ICO has retreated, hurt and scared, into its cave, licking its wounds, and hiding from an uncaring world. How did it fall so far from grace? What must it do the regain its position at the crypto table?It\u2019s almost guaranteed that that the heavy-handed scaremongering of the SEC spooked the market far more than some dodgy ICO scammers. In trying to protect the greedy speculators with eyes too wide to read the small print, the SEC ensured that everyone got rekt\u2026 So thanks for that.Tokens which clearly are securities, are now being shilled through STOs, but that\u2019s really not in the pioneering spirit of Bitcoin. Neither are registration and securities regulations going to prevent STO investors from getting burned. This is not purely a crypto-phenomenon, and has been going on for as long as securities have existed.Importantly, the SEC must accept that not all tokens are securities, however much investors wanted them to behave that way.Kik fighting this in court is a good thing for the entire industry, and we should all hope they win. The SEC have overstepped their remit and need to be told so. ICOs are a perfectly valid way to raise funds in the crypto space. The current position of the SEC is only going to see its country falling behind because the Commission only has jurisdiction in the US.But if they are challenged and beaten then the (not so) humble ICO could rise again\u2026Only this time, RTFMWhite-Paper.Will Kik be successful in taking on the SEC?

Bithumb Seeks Backdoor IPOBithumb, the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency exchange my volume, is reportedly planning on forgoing an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and garnering admission as a publically-listed company in the United States by way of a reverse merger.The Singapore-based company has, as reported by CNBC, signed a legally-binding document \u2014 which states its intent to purchase the already-publically-traded Blockchain Industries (BCII) and rename it \u201cBlockchain Exchange Alliance.\u201dBlockchain Industries isn\u2019t exactly a major player, however. The over-the-counter traded company needs to meet stricter requirements in order to find itself trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq \u2014 requirements Bithumb presumably intends to meet, given that the newly-named Blockchain Exchange Alliance would make up the lion\u2019s share of the merged company.CNBC also claims to have confirmed information that Blockchain Exchange Alliance plans on aggressively expanding beyond the first and foremost market leader, Bitcoin (BTC) 00, by purchasing various global exchanges for the still-relatively-new asset class \u2014 and by \u201caggressive,\u201d we\u2019re talking about nearly half a century\u2019s worth by the end of next year.At the time of this publication, no cryptocurrency exchange is publically listed in the United States.A Rough ReputationBithumb, meanwhile, has recently been accused of faking its trading volume and engaging in wash trading. The platform was also hacked to the tune of $31 million in assets less than a year ago \u2014 which hasn\u2019t done a lot for the platforms reputation against major industry players like Binance and Coinbase.Regarding RegulationsAll attention in the regulatory space, meanwhile, is currently focused on the recently-withdrawn Bitcoin ETF application from VanEck/SolidX and the impending launch of Intercontinental Exchange\u2019s (ICE) Bakkt. While the former may sting for those longing for an increase in Bitcoin\u2019s institutional exposure, the latter still remains on the slate as good news \u2014 assuming the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) revs its engine following a lengthy and still-ongoing US government shutdown.What do you think of Bithumb\u2019s plans to go public via the slightly-unorthodox method of conducting a reverse merger?

Harnessing the BTC network while enabling instant transactions and near-zero fees, these Lapps are already demonstrating some promising use-cases for Bitcoin\u2019s second layer. It is just over a year since Blockstream introduced their \u2018Lightning Charge\u2019 API, allowing easier creation of Lightning Apps. So it\u2019s high time we took a look at how far the market has come, with a round-up of the best LApps available right now.WalletsThe first thing you\u2019ll need is a Lightning-enabled wallet. After all, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to make and receive Lightning Network (LN) payments without one. Fortunately, user-friendly wallets have proliferated in the past twelve months, which means you won\u2019t even need to set up your own Lightning node (though that is recommended to minimize trust).Early players like Zap (iOS and Desktop), and \u00c9clair (Android and Desktop) are still going strong. Or you may prefer brand new iOS and Android options like Shango or BlueWallet. Even old favorites like Electrum (Desktop) recently announced upcoming Lightning integration.A (reasonably) comprehensive list is available here. Although it comes with the caveat that recent additions will likely contain bugs, be custodial or closed-source, etc.In other words, it\u2019s okay to be #reckless, but be sure to test this bleeding edge technology with only small amounts for the time being.MarketplacesNow you\u2019ve got your lightning wallet, why not use it to buy stuff? More and more online stores and marketplaces are integrating Lightning payments. Here are two favorites.CoinMall is a peer-to-peer marketplace where you can buy and sell digital products with zero-fees. And Bitrefill is a popular online store selling mobile top-ups and a wide range of gift cards, with which you can buy just about anything.They have even started selling gift cards for the Azteco-like FastBitcoins. So you can now buy or gift bitcoin, and have it delivered via LN.Monetize Your ContentOne of the great things about LN is the ability to instantly send (and receive) micropayments. This makes it feasible for content creators to receive bitcoin (even as little as a few satoshis) for their work.Writers can publish their work on the Y\u2019Alls website, which charges readers half a cent per article through LN. Or if you already have a WordPress blog, why not use Lightning Publisher For WordPress. This Blockstream LApp allows readers to see a preview of your post, but requires a Lightning payment to read the rest. BTCPay Server announced a similar service just yesterday.Another Blockstream LApp is FileBazaar, which allows you to sell digital files through an ad-free storefront interface. Images, video, audio, pdfs, and text can be stored in a simple directory, browsed, previewed, and purchased.Tips Gratefully ReceivedPerhaps all this is a bit too much and all you really want is a simple tip jar. After all, the world should be able to recognise your greatness from a 140 character tweet (for example), and reward you accordingly.Again, you are spoilt for choice in this regard, with nanotip, LightningTip, and tippin.me all vying for your attention. CoinTippy is another service that specifically allows you to collect rewards on Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, and Twitch.And That\u2019s Just The Start\u2026Check part two for even more LApps, covering gaming, gambling, messaging, e-commerce tools and more.Have you tried any Lapps?

A Focus on SecurityDays after the cryptocurrency exchange Cryptopia got hacked, Palo Alto-based security company, BitGo, announced that it has developed a platform allowing traders to buy and sell digital assets right from BitGo\u2019s cold storage custody.BitGo closed a Series B funding round in October 2018, bringing in $58.5 million and attracting investors such as Novogratz\u2019 Galaxy Digital Ventures and Goldman Sachs.BitGo will team up with SEC and FINRA-regulated OTC trading platform Genesis Global Trading to establish the necessary infrastructure, liquidity, and compliance.Genesis Trading will essentially match BitGo customer\u2019s buy and sell orders, according to the platform\u2019s CEO, Michael Moro. The assets will never leave cold-storage since Genesis has a cold wallet with BitGo.The cryptocurrencies, which will be available initially through the new solution include Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, Ripple, and ZCash.The move is geared toward satisfying the custodial requirements for attracting institutional investors.The Need for CustodyThe need for institutional-grade custody solution has been highlighted more than once and by more than one industry experts.Novogratz himself said last year that a solution of the kind could propel the next bull run.\u201cI think the next move up is going to need custody from a trusting source,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s going to need a little more regulatory clarity. [\u2026] We wouldn\u2019t take out $10,000 without those two things because that\u2019s what brings the institutional investors in. But we\u2019re going to get there.\u201dA serious development in this regard would be Bakkt\u2019s warehousing solution if it gets the pending regulatory approval. Besides elevated measures for physical security, Bakkt wants to enable pre-funded purchases and sales of Bitcoin futures, essentially eliminating the risk of default.At the same time, its clearinghouse will also have a dedicated guaranty fund, entirely funded by Bakkt, to cover the platform\u2019s holdings.What do you think of BitGo\u2019s new platform?

Specifically, there were 64,768 Bitcoin Core nodes at press time January 16, equating to 99.02 percent of the total.In terms of distribution, 2490 reachable nodes were in the US, followed by 1927 in Germany. France, the third-largest node hub, was still significantly behind the two leaders with 660 reachable nodes.China had just 409 nodes, nonetheless giving it fifth place in the rankings, while Japan, despite its burgeoning Bitcoin consumer economy, came in tenth with 246.Reachable nodes reached a peak of 12,500 in November 2017 during the run-up to Bitcoin\u2019s all-time price high around $20,000.

As technical sources note the exact number of Bitcoin nodes ultimately remains a mystery due to some being undetectable.2019: Rise of the Nodes?Nevertheless, one possible reason for the reversal of last year\u2019s trend of decreasing full nodes is new products such as the Lightning Network\u2019s Nodl and Casa Node, which are making it easier for regular people to run a full node out-of-the-box.But why should individuals run a full node? According to Bitcoin wiki, it is the most trustless way to use the Bitcoin network, not to mention making the entire network more robust via decentralization.Running a full node as your wallet is the only way to know for sure that none of bitcoin\u2019s rules have been broken. Rules like no coins were spent not belonging to the owner, that no coins were spent twice, that no inflation happens outside of the schedule and that all the rules needed to make the system work are followed. All other kinds of wallet involve trusting a third party server.At the same time, new users of the Casa Node, for example, may not always be reflected in monitoring sites like Bitnodes.\u201cCasa Node owners have the option to make their node accessible by others \u2013 this would render them visible on bitnodes,\u201d the company\u2019s content strategist, Blake Neuman, told Bitcoinist.If this is switched on and a user\u2019s port forwarding settings allow it, they can pass information out to incoming nodes. On the other hand, they also have the option to only be receiving information from the network by switching the setting off.What do you think about Bitcoin\u2019s node count and hashrate?

The Belarus-based platform is intended to enable investors to trade and invest in common financial instruments such as equities, commodities, and indices directly, without having to convert their cryptocurrencies in fiat.According to the official release, it will eventually issue over 10,000 tokenized securities but will start with over 150, including everything from popular stocks to silver, oil and natural gas.Users will be able to purchase tokens, which mirror the performance of certain conventional assets such as Apple shares listed on NASDAQ. It will cost the same price as an actual Apple share and can be bought with BTC or ETH.Currency.com is the very first blockchain-based business licensed by Belarus\u2019 High Technology Park (HTP) under the country\u2019s Decree No. 8 \u201cOn The Development of a Digital Economy.\u201dApart from being compliant with local legislation, the platform imposes strict KYC and AML requirements aided by blockchain intelligence services such as Elliptic, Chainanalysis, and Coinfirm. In other words, blockchain tracking software will be used to monitor transactions.Additionally, Currency.com is going to use its FCA and CySEC regulated sister platform to offer access to the tokenized versions of a contract for the exchange of a specific index, commodity or equity.Tokenized Assets: A Trend in The Making?Earlier this month, Bitcoinist reported that an Estonian-based platform called DX Exchange would offer users to trade big-name stocks using tokens on the Ethereum blockchain through smart contracts.Meanwhile, back in 2018, Singapore\u2019s Monetary Authority (MAS) \u2013 the country\u2019s de-facto central bank, teamed up with major firms like Deloitte, Anquan, and NASDAQ, to develop solutions for simultaneous exchange and settlement of tokenized digital currencies and security assets.It appears that the tokenization of traditional assets like stocks is becoming a growing trend as the number of platforms enabling this is increasing with each day.What do you think of token-based traditional assets?

This is the result of an ongoing collaboration between the two companies.Fast (And Cheap) As LightningLightning Network is a second-layer protocol, utilizing a large network of open two-party channels, to enable multiple payments, without the need to record each one individually to the underlying Bitcoin blockchain. This circumvents Bitcoin\u2019s transaction rate limit, allowing faster transactions and greater throughput at lower fees.Fully regulated Poland-based exchange, BTCBIT, deals in bitcoin and most other major cryptocurrencies. The ability to now use Lightning Network payments brings the benefit of quicker and cheaper payments to its users.Not Quite As AdvertisedBitfury\u2019s blog post goes into detail on the method for selling your bitcoin and withdrawing funds using LN. Whilst the process is fairly straightforward, there would seem to be a slight anomaly in the thinking behind it.The problem arises in the transfer of fiat funds from BTCBIT to the customer\u2019s bank account. This can happen through either the SEPA or SWIFT systems.The SEPA system is only for transactions between European Union countries, made in Euros. These transactions are generally free of charge but usually, take from 1 to 3 working days. So the benefit of a near-instant transaction becomes somewhat less useful.The SWIFT system is even slower, with most transactions taking 3 to 5 working days. What\u2019s more, transactions through the SWIFT system can cost between $30 and $50, minimizing the benefit of lower payments through LN.Of course, one would have to use one of these methods of transfer, even without LN. So if you\u2019re already paying and waiting, why accept unnecessary additional cost and delay?The Right DirectionDespite the friction of fiat on and off-ramps, the wider enabling of LN payments is a sign of further progress for the (still-experimental) enhancement. So any implementation on this scale should be applauded.This year has already seen Lightning Network implementation such as the promising \u2018Sphinx\u2019 upgrade, allowing instant sending of funds without creating an invoice to reduce friction for novice users.Also increasing LN\u2019s user-friendliness this year was the launch of a \u2018granny-friendly\u2019 LN wallet in Australia as well as iOS and Android versions of the user-friendly Bluewallet.Continued development of the LN platform and ever-increasing use-cases should spur renewed interest in Bitcoin as peer-to-peer digital cash.Will more exchanges adopt Lightning Network for faster and cheaper transactions?

The adoption of crypto by large scale financial institutions is taking longer than expected but is still on track. The bear market certainly caused some to hesitate but today we have confirmation that things are moving forward as planned.The Wall Street backed service Bakkt, which plans to allow clients to store and spend crypto in a user-friendly and secure way, has clearly demonstrated that they are going ahead despite delays caused by the partial US government shutdown.In this blog post yesterday, Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler announced their first strategic acquisition. The Chicago based company they\u2019re buying is Rosenthal Collins Group, which boasts more than 100 years experience in the financial services industry. The deal, which is set to be finalized next month, will see RCG\u2019s team completely integrated into the young crypto company.Meanwhile, in Switzerland, a country that is way ahead of the curve on crypto adoption, a major financial institution known as Vontobel has announced their own crypto custodial service and digital asset vault, which is available for their clients now.My friends, institutional adoption of cryptoassets is finally upon us.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsShutdown: Day 25Brexit Vote DayEthereum Upgrade TonightPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of January 15th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsStocks are up today on the news that China will be following in Trump\u2019s footsteps and stimulating their economy with massive tax cuts.As economic conditions tighten around the world, one of the only solutions left for many countries to encourage spending is to cut taxes.Of course, the long term effect of these type of actions is usually to increase the national deficit as the world\u2019s largest economies sink further into staggering debt. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be an issue as long as they keep making their payments on the debt.The rally seems to be holding into the European session and even the safe havens like Gold, Swiss Francs, and the Yen are pulling back.Today is the 25th day of the partial US government shutdown with no end in sight. We\u2019ll also hear from Mario Draghi at 16:00 in France. Let\u2019s hope for some strong earnings reports from the financial sector today and tomorrow.Brexit VoteBigger than all of that though, at least in the UK, is the critical vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan, which is scheduled to take place around 19:00 London time.Consensus seems to be that the vote will not carry and some are even predicting the worst upset for a Prime Minister in British History, which does seem a bit exaggerated to me.Due to the potential impact on the markets many brokers, including eToro, have limited the maximum allowed leverage going into the event on all UK stocks and most major currency pairs. For details of how trading will be affected, please check out @eToroTeam page for updates.Something tells me though, that this may not be as big as people are preparing for. First, the fact that brokers are limiting leverage in itself should reduce volatility. Second, if the announcement is already set to upset then there shouldn\u2019t be much surprise to the markets. You never know though.Upgrade Time for ETHAt block #7080000, which should happen sometime tomorrow night, the Ethereum network will undergo a hard fork.Hard forks might seem difficult to understand because we\u2019re so used to centralized computing, but in a decentralized world, the only way to make a major upgrade is to fork it.For example, when Microsoft wants to upgrade from Windows 9 to Windows 10, they have their dev team write the code, and then users upgrade one by one in their own time. In decentralized computing, the entire network needs to upgrade together.A hard fork is like a copy-paste action, where a new blockchain is born and if all goes well, the old one dies.Sometimes, when there is a disagreement among the community about the upgrade, some members will choose to keep the old version of the blockchain alive and we see a split. The most famous cases of this was when Bitcoin Cash split off of Bitcoin on August 1st 2017 and when Ethereum split with Ethereum Classic back in 2016.However, the Constantinople upgrade has already received widespread backing from the entire community and so we hope everything goes smoothly. It\u2019s important to note that there is no action required by the end users. If you are holding ETH on eToro or any wallet or exchange, the upgrade should be done for you automatically.By this time on Thursday, we should have a brand new Ethereum, which is faster, cheaper, and has 33% less inflation.Let\u2019s have an excellent day.This content is provided for information and educational purposes only and should not be considered to be investment advice or recommendation.Past performance is not an indication of future results.

US Lottery Ticket Sales Exceed Entire BTC Market Cap Christina Comben | Jan 16, 2019 | 03:00 Share Tweet Send Share Every year, US citizens spend north of $70 billion on state lottery tickets. That\u2019s almost $8 billion more than the entire market cap of Bitcoin. And more than half of the entire crypto market as a whole.US Citizens Spend Billions on Lottery TicketsComparison is a great way of putting things in context. Lose your wallet, arrive late to a meeting, miss a flight\u2026 These can all seem like catastrophic events when you\u2019re living through the painful moment. But there\u2019s usually a voice of reason from your partner, a caring relative or stranger, or simply just turning on the news. People are dying in Africa. Your problem is insignificant.In a similar and yet totally off-the-topic sort of a way, the US state lottery spend does the same thing to crypto. In the US every year, they spend more than the entire market cap of Bitcoin on lottery tickets. Money that is simply shot straight into the drain. The latest accurate information on just how much of their savings the hopeful masses plow into lottery tickets is from 2016, the latest year the US Census has data on. And in 2016, some $80.55 billion was readily thrown away on what is to all intents and purposes just another tax, albeit one that citizens willingly pay. US Spend on Lottery TicketsIn 2017, the number dropped a little with CNN placing it at approximately $73.5 billion.Here\u2019s another mindblower for you. About half of all US adults buy a state lottery ticket. Around five percent of them hold Bitcoin.Facebook Active Users Make Bitcoin Look TinyAnd just one more comparison to give you food for thought. Despite gathering controversy over data usage and leaks, Facebook has almost 2.3 billion active monthly users around the world.Facebook Active Monthly UsersHow many does crypto have? It hasn\u2019t quite pierced 32 million. With Bitcoin Market Journal placing the number at 22 million Bitcoin wallets as of July 2018. Okay, so Facebook had a headstart on Bitcoin of four years. It was also a free product until people realized they were paying with their data. But still, 2 billion+ for a social media platform compared with less than a third of a billion for a revolutionary neutral, sound money based financial system puts things into perspective.Moreover, of the people who have actually heard of Bitcoin around the world, a recent video by Naomi Brockwell shows that the majority have no idea what it is.What Does All This Mean?Bitcoin may be all-consuming in the lives of many, but it\u2019s barely a fly on the windshield of most people around the world. It\u2019s still early days. However, let\u2019s do the math:According to the Washington Post, taking a state by state average on US lottery spend places the figure at around $600 per person per year. If the average person had invested $600 in Bitcoin in January 2016, they would have scored around 1.25 bitcoin. By January 2018, that would have translated into $21,250. Even if they didn\u2019t cash in on their investment back then, they\u2019d still have around $4,500 now\u2013rather more useful than a pile of scraps of paper.It\u2019s interesting that Harvard professor Ken Rogoff compared buying Bitcoin to buying a lottery ticket. Even with fewer users than the most unpopular of social media platforms, and a market cap dwarfed by US lottery sales, the simple numbers alone prove this to be incorrect.Not to mention the obvious fact that when buying bitcoin, everyone holding wins. When buying a lottery ticket, only one person in hundreds of millions of people wins. With odds at something like 100 million to one, even your chances of riding a spontaneous \u2018shitcoin\u2019 pump are infinitely higher. Whichever way you swing it, lottery tickets are mathematically proven to get you rekt\u2013and it\u2019s still an $80-billion industry in the US alone.Would you rather buy bitcoin than a lottery ticket?

The question remains, which means of storage has the least risk exposure?CZ Sees ThreeFor Binance CEO, Changpeng \u2018CZ\u2019 Zhao, users have three options; self-storage, on exchanges, or using decentralized exchanges (DEX). Yesterday, CZ commented on coin security in reaction to a hack of Cryptopia, weighing the pros and cons of the three options.Store coins yourself. You fight hackers yourself, and guard from losing wallet yourself. Computer breaks, USBs gets lost.Store on an exchange. Only use the most reputable, proven secure, exchanges.Or move to DEX, disrupt ourselves. https://t.co/Ci4ux9I3VD\u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) January 15, 2019The Binance CEO advised those looking to store on centralized exchanges to use only the most reputable ones. Though, Mt. Gox used to be the most reputable exchange in 2014, but then got hacked for over half a billion dollars.Despite later providing clarification, CZ\u2019s tweet seemed skewered to favor the use of third-party services, especially DEX platforms. He later even admitted that the statement should be considered as a promotion of the company\u2019s DEX platform. However, hackers did manage to steal $12 million from Bancor, a supposed \u2018decentralized\u2019 platform, in 2018.Don\u2019t Use Exchanges to Store CryptocurrencyFor Kraken CEO, Jesse Powell, users shouldn\u2019t more cryptos than they need to trade actively. Instead, cryptocurrency owners should use (admittedly, also reputable) hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor.Jesse PowellPowell countered CZ\u2019s claims of decentralized exchanges being safer, saying:DEXes are not a panacea \u2014 look at The DAO. Open source just means exploits will be discovered sooner (probably not by good guys).PLEASE do not store more coins on an exchange (including @krakenfx) than you need to actively trade. Use @LedgerHQ or @Trezor. DEXes are not a panacea \u2014 look at The DAO. Open source just means exploits will be discovered sooner (probably not by good guys). \ud83d\ude4f https://t.co/LmzhtCjpM0\u2014 Jesse Powell (@jespow) January 16, 2019Pierre Rochard of Bitcoin Advisory also disputed Zhao\u2019s comments noting that exchange wallets were at a much higher risk than personal storage wallets.In October 2018, Bitcoinist reported that hackers had stolen close to $900 million from exchange platforms over the past two years.Since the Mt. Gox heist of 2014, several other platforms have fallen victim to cybercriminals, and possibly inside jobs as well \u2013 though this is hard to prove.So while Zhao talks about reputable and trusted platforms, it appears centralized exchanges are playing a game of \u2018cryptocurrency musical chairs.\u2019\u201cYou fight hackers yourself, and guard from losing [password] yourself. Computer breaks, [2fa] gets lost.\u201dMore individual exchange accounts have been hacked than individual wallets.Disappointing but not surprising to see \u201cindustry leaders\u201d spread bad info. https://t.co/xX4MJJhBUJ\u2014 Pierre Rochard [\u26a1\ufe0f] (@pierre_rochard) January 15, 2019Meanwhile, former Trezor CEO, Alena Vranova, echoed Powell, advising crypto owners to limit their risk exposure by controlling your own private keys. Instead of using third-party services like online exchange wallets, Vranova says hardware wallets with multisig function provide far greater security.No storage option, however, can be considered to be 100 percent secure. But as the likes of industry veterans like Vranova and Powell recommend, cryptocurrency users should always strive to minimize risk and never keep more funds than required on exchanges.Which cryptocurrency storage option do you think has the most positive upside-downside tradeoff?

As highlighted on the chart, it becomes clear that where we have seen these conditions in the past, we have seen a sharp selloff to retest the lows.Bitcoin is therefore starting to reveal some underlying weakness in its market posture and indicates that another retest of the low $3ks could be on the horizon in the near future.With CBOE XBT futures expiring today, there may be some hope of a short term relief rally as we have seen previously but generally speaking it seems likely that Bitcoin price needs to prove its metal at the $3.1ks before we move higher.[Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are the personal opinion of the author and do not reflect the views of Bitcoinist.

Those looking beyond the doom and gloom believe the case for universal basic income (UBI) is getting stronger by the day \u2013 and now technological advancements are making it a viable option, moving it from theory to reality.UBI is a revolutionary economic concept whereby every individual is granted a fixed, minimum wage to cover basic needs. With the threat of global financial crisis, projects that explore distribution mechanisms to assist the poorest in society are gaining interest and support.For instance, GoodDollar, a research hub that is experimenting how decentralised cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology may enable models based on UBI with the central aim of reducing global wealth inequality, is generating interest from all over the world.In mid-January, French crypto-finance website VideoBourse spoke at length with Yoni Assia, eToro Co-Founder and Chief Executive, who launched GoodDollar at Web Summit in Lisbon in November 2018.\u201cGoodDollar is a non-profit project eToro is supporting,\u201d said Mr Assia in the VideoBourse interview, acknowledging that his multi-asset investment platform has committed an initial $1 million. \u201cThe idea behind GoodDollar was that there needs to be a disruption to how money is being distributed and generated.\u201cOne of the biggest issues in the world is a very simple thing: the rich get richer and poor get poorer. That leads to a growing inequality in society, and eventually that leads to very bad things. The way the system works leads to inequality \u2013 it\u2019s how money is being distributed, and how money is being generated.\u201dMr Assia explained: \u201cFor example, let\u2019s assume interest rate plus inflation is 10 per cent a year. We know that 10 per cent of the global population own 90 per cent of the wealth. So 9 per cent of the 10 per cent generated in interest rates would go to the richest 10 per cent. Meanwhile, the remaining 1 per cent would go to the other 90 per cent of the population.\u201cThat\u2019s basically just because of how interest rates and inflation work, and that is because money has never been on the blockchain. If you could create mechanics within cryptocurrency that creates better wealth distribution potentially you could improve significantly inequality. By making the world more equal then more people can participate in the economy.\u201dHence the launch of GoodDollar. In the months leading up to the announcement at Web Summit, a growing team of digital pioneers, economists and builders started experimenting and exploring what might be possible in this space, at the intersection between UBI and blockchain. The early momentum has been very encouraging.In late November, GoodDollar helped establish an OpenUBI ecosystem with a number of other partners. The OpenUBI was launched to foster collaboration and discussion around UBI and its technological implementation. There is an OpenUBI meet-up in Berlin at the end of January, and in February there will be a GoodDollar hackathon event at eToro\u2019s Israel office.\u201cA lot of our efforts are going into researching how to build GoodDollar in a purely decentralised way,\u201d Mr Assia continued in his VideoBourse interview. \u201cOn the one hand we\u2019re trying to build a simple user interface so people can connect to it \u2026 on the other hand we want to build something that\u2019s truly decentralised. We understand that for something like this to succeed, it needs to scale on a much wider scale than eToro.\u201dAfter a positive first few months, there are many more exciting things to look forward to in 2019 for the GoodDollar project. Mr Assia, who will be speaking at Paris Fintech Forum 2019 later in January, revealed that \u201cwe\u2019ll be launching the first GoodDollar experiment within the next six to nine months\u201d.He added: \u201cWe definitely look at this as something that\u2019s experimental, based on code and a lot of research that we\u2019re doing. We have a few academics on the team, and experts in legal and regulation and economics.\u201cI am a very big believer in a new type of innovative asset \u2013 like GoodDollar \u2013 that creates a paradigm shift in terms of how we think about money, and how money is being generated.\u201dAs the markets remain volatile and global financial uncertainty looms, projects like GoodDollar could well revolutionise how money is distributed at scale \u2013 and sooner rather than later.Join GoodDollar. The project needs builders, scientists, and experts in identity, privacy, and financial governance, as well as philanthropists and ambassadors.

For bitcoin, it doesn\u2019t seem so great at the moment. As we can see, the contracts for the bitcoin futures on the CBOE are currently in backwardation, meaning that contracts with a later expiration are trading consecutively lower.Of course, something like this might have made me nervous on a normal day, but then I remembered that oil futures were trading in contango (opposite of backwardation) before the prices collapsed back in October.Also, the volumes here are kind of silly. I mean, 227 BTC (less than $1 million) trading on a contract that expires today. Sure, the title is catchy but what can we really learn from this?@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsShutdown: Day 26Day\u2019s to Brexit: 72Constantinople DelayedPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of January 16th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsYou may have noticed that we\u2019re now including a countdown to Brexit in the highlights section, right next to the US government shutdown counter. I think they fit together neatly. Two governments descending into a state of turmoil over political wrangling.Today, Theresa May\u2019s government will see the ultimate test. If she loses the vote of no confidence, the UK heads to new elections\u2026 again.Over in the East, China decided to inject the market with a record level of stimulus. Yesterday\u2019s tax cuts may have been insufficient to maintain growth, so they\u2019ve gone the route of free cash for the market.In addition, it seems the Institue of International Finance has made a rather shocking estimation. It seems our entire economic system, from our homes to places of work and our governments are increasingly reliant on debt.Given all the above, it\u2019s no wonder that the European Central Bank is now sounding a new alarm.Don\u2019t worry about any of this though. The stock markets are up today. Hope the earnings reports from the financial sector go well.Ethereum Upgrade DelayedAfter all the excitement, the crypto community was disappointed to hear last night that the long-awaited Constantinople upgrade has been delayed once again.It seems a critical bug was found at the last minute and the lead developers pulled the plug. Here we can see the crypto market, led by Ethereum, dropping moments after the announcement was made.We\u2019re seeing a bit of a recovery this morning but that was really scary. I mean, it\u2019s good that they caught the bug before going live but the fact that it came within 30 hours of the upgrade is a bit nervewracking.These things do happen, virtually all major platforms including Windows, Android, and Apple Operating systems, have seen critical bugs before. Though it would be possible to release a patch, fork the network again, and return to normal, that kind of process could in itself have done irreparable damage.We hope that Constantinople whenever it is ready, goes through without any additional hitches.This content is provided for information and educational purposes only and should not be considered to be investment advice or recommendation.Past performance is not an indication of future results.

This time to USP Tucson, yet another high security prison where he will be locked up likely alongside fewer murderers and hardcore gang members than previously. Ross Ulbricht Moved AgainBut more sex offenders owing to the prison\u2019s Sex Offender Management Program; this could make it a safer place compared to a regular high security prison. Ulbricht is in the process of serving a double life sentence as well as another forty years without a chance of parole.Since the whole process started, Ulbricht has been through different prisons, but the current one had been recommended second by Judge Katherine Bolan Forrest, who oversaw the case. The first recommendation was reportedly FCI Petersburg; a medium security system, which granted him a safer environment for his life sentence.Ross Ulbricht writing in prisonUlbricht was first kept during his trial at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. Right after his sentence was given in July 2017, he was moved to USP Florence High in Colorado \u2013 known as the \u2018Alcatraz of the Rockies\u2019 \u2013 where he stayed until he was moved to USP Tucson, Arizona.Ulbricht\u2019s sentence consists of double life imprisonment and an amount of forty extra years, since he was found guilty of computer hacking, money laundering, as well as conspiracy to traffic narcotics due to the creation of Silk Road, an anonymous marketplace where people were able to sell and buy things anonymously.The marketplace was in line with Ulbricht\u2019s vision of a free market, where people could be able to transact as long as nobody was hurt in the process. He started out developing the web site back in 2010 and kept it running up until October, 2013, when federal authorities arrested him in the science fiction section of a San Francisco library. The U.S. government accused him of being the main creator behind Silk Road.His mother, Lyn Ulbricht, is still hoping that Ross can be moved to a non-high security prison in the future, since she does not see him as a dangerous criminal. She hopes that a few years of good behavior will grant him the opportunity to be moved over to at least a medium security facility.She recently told Yahoo Finance UK:I can\u2019t let him rot in prison like this. I don\u2019t see how I can just go, \u2018Hey Ross, sorry bye, I\u2019m going to go off and pursue my bliss\u2019 or whatever, get a hobby. I can\u2019t imagine just leaving him there.According to what has been posted on the Free Ross twitter account, Ulbricht\u2019s family will not stop fighting to get his sentence reduced. They have been trying their best to spread the word about the injustice they feel has happened with their son, and currently, they are working on getting signatures on a petition, where they have 150,000 signatures target. Thanks to all of Ulbricht\u2019s supporters, they are approaching that goal.Ulbricht has also enjoyed support from high places. A candidate for U.S. Senate, Eric Brakey, recently promised to speak with President Trump about clemency for Ross Ulbricht. Mr. Brakey, however, ultimately lost to incumbent Senator Angus King.Will Ross Ulbricht ever be pardoned? Share your thoughts below!Images courtesy of Shutterstock"}

It considers both the bullish and bearish cases of \u2018moon\u2019 and \u2018doom\u2019, and unsurprisingly comes down somewhere between the two.The Bear NecessitiesThe naysayers believe that the price of bitcoin 00 will ultimately fall to zero. They argue that with nothing backing the currency, it is fundamentally without value. For them, it is just a case of waiting until the market realizes this.The St Louis Fed, however, argues that an asset can clearly trade above its fundamental value, without that value ever being zero. Both gold and the US Dollar, for example, trade at above their fundamental value, for industrial applications or discharging tax obligations.These assets trade at a premium to reflect their value as exchange media, but even without this premium, their value would not be zero.The report suggests that Bitcoin is essentially a database management system, offering money storage and transfer. The fundamental value comes from its properties of being permissionless and decentralized, which gives it demand. It is the removal of these two properties which causes the lack of demand for a \u2018FedCoin\u2019.As long as there are people who value these features then the lower boundary on price will always be above zero. And as long as Bitcoin exists and has a non-zero value, other people are free to also use it. This is similar in concept to Nassim Taleb\u2019s \u201cdominance of the stubborn minority.\u201dThe St Louis Fed concludes:The fundamental demand for Bitcoin derives from the fact that there are at least some people who value [decentralization and permissionlessness] features. This fundamental demand provides a non-zero lower bound on the price of Bitcoin.Increasing Altcoins Could Dilute Bitcoin\u2019s ValueThe long term bullish case for Bitcoin revolves around ever-increasing price due to limited supply and growing demand.The problem with this, says the report, is that we must also consider altcoins, which are essentially unlimited. For a bullish outcome, Bitcoin should appreciate relative to other cryptocurrencies, so that its share of the crypto market cap remains roughly constant.The St Louis Fed gives an example considering $5 and $10 bills, whereby an increase in supply of one decreases the value of both. But these bills have a fixed rate of exchange, which is not true for different cryptocurrencies.So this potential issue arises if investors mentally group cryptocurrencies together, in which case the increasing supply of altcoins could depress prices across the entire market.The report concludes by saying that:economic theory predicts that the price dynamic of an unbacked asset is likely to be highly volatile and inherently unforecastableAlthough the price of bitcoin is unlikely to fall to zero while there are people who desire its qualities as a money storage and transfer system, it could face continuing downward pressure from an increasing supply of altcoins.Do you agree with the St Louis Federal Reserve?

According to Sidorenko:Even if Russia wants to place its cryptocurrency assets now, it simply cannot do this, due to the fact that we do not have any mechanisms that would allow us to introduce a system, where these assets would be stored, which authorities would be responsible for it, which would be responsible for abuses and stuff.Recently, Vladislav Ginko, a Russian Economist with ties to the Kremlin declared that the government planned to ditch the U.S. Dollar for Bitcoin. This move, according to Ginko could even take place as early as February 2019.Responding to Ginko\u2019s claim, Sidorenko opined:Under this statement, there is not a bit of common sense, much less ideas that would be considered in government circles. The Russian Federation, like any other country in the world, is simply not ready today to somehow combine its traditional financial system with cryptocurrencies. And to say that in Russia this idea can be implemented in the next at least 30 years is unlikely to be possible.Nevertheless, the State Duma did announce that it would pay particular attention to matters related to the development of the country\u2019s digital economy, putting cryptocurrency regulations high on the agenda for 2019.\u2018Cryptoruble\u2019 Still Years AwayFor any Kremlin investment in Bitcoin to be feasible, Russia would need an intermediary cryptocurrency, like the proposed \u201ccryptoruble.\u201d Recently, Bitcoinist reported that a \u2018crypto\u2019 version of the ruble was still two to three years away.Commenting on the cryptorubble idea, the Chairperson of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Cryptocurrency Risk at the State Duma, said:A similar idea is already being considered within the framework of the EAEU, but the BRICS countries have moved closer to it. If a cryptocurrency unit had been invented, which allowed making payments only for energy, in fact, the Russian Federation could have made a long and long-term advance in the economy.Do you think the reports of Russia investing in Bitcoin are nothing more than rumors?

If you\u2019d like to live a free life, working wherever you want, and build up a capital that will make it possible for you to stop working at the early 30s, affiliate marketing is the best choice. It has the upper hand over both funding your own company and working as an independent professional.The odds of your affiliate network making a profit are much higher than with many other business ventures, especially founding a tech startup \u2013 a sector where the risks are very high. On the other hand, the final upside of your actions is also set much higher than the one you have just working as a freelancer \u2013 writing articles or social media posts for other people\u2019s sites.There\u2019s one crucial thing being an entrepreneur, and an affiliate marketer have in common.

For far too long Chinese companies have infringed on U.S. IP, copying innovative American ideas and making cheaper, more accessible versions. According to Nethercutt:U.S. negotiators took a stand for American innovation \u2014 and companies will reap the benefits of more strict enforcement of their developments.This approach to protecting and fostering innovation on its shores was long overdue and a step in the right direction. However, the story unfolding in Washington is quite different from the one surrounding cryptocurrencies. Nethercutt states:While diplomats at the State Department are negotiating hard to pave the way for American innovation, U.S. regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have been slow to make pronouncements regarding cryptocurrencies. He goes on to argue that this has left plenty of U.S. companies in limbo. The regulatory uncertainty has even forced innovation to go offshore. It\u2019s about time that policymakers wake up and realize that existing securities laws do not apply to cryptocurrencies. They must take the right steps to create new legislation.Regulatory Uncertainty Has Let Bad Actors InAccording to Nethercutt, the U.S. dragging its heels over crypto has allowed bad actors to enter the space. While the SEC was falling asleep at the wheel, China has been busily building out its mining capacity. The country has already amassed some 73 percent of the Bitcoin hash rate.According to a study by Princeton University, China now has the power to manipulate or even sabotage cryptocurrencies at will or censor or interfere with transactions.It is increasingly clear that China has come to play an outsized role in the cryptocurrency space.Moreover, the DEA claims that there has been a spike in the number of cartels using Chinese money launderers to clean their operations using cryptocurrency. Blaming the VictimThese kinds of headlines generally serve to tarnish cryptocurrencies with the same brush. They become associated with criminal activity, money laundering, hacks, scams, the dark web, and a whole host of other nefarious deeds that upstanding citizens want no part of. But this, Nethercutt argues, is a case of blaming the victim.In fact, these developments merely underscore the pressing need for U.S. lawmakers to protect and promote American efforts in the development of these technologies. Instead of ceding control to Chinese interests and other bad actors, elected officials must act decisively to provide a clear framework under which our companies can thrive. Once again, the U.S. is allowing China to hijack its innovation. Worse than that, the SEC is actively strangling it by regulation that is absent or poorly thought out at best.Increasing Institutional Adoption Says OtherwiseUnderscoring the decade-long arguments of crypto, bad actors constitute a minuscule percentage of the total users of these technologies. Particularly in the short term. In fact, there are far more dollar bills being used for money laundering than cryptocurrency. Around two-thirds of U.S. $100 dollar bills are outside of the county with no one keeping track of how they\u2019re being hung out to dry.Moreover, major companies like Walmart, IBM, JPMorgan, and even Facebook are all exploring blockchain technology and applications for their businesses. Nethercutt argues that this could indicate that mass adoption is not far away:The potential benefits of widespread cryptocurrency adoption \u2014 from seamless international financial transactions to enhanced logistical tracking abilities \u2014 offer a far more compelling argument for protecting this nascent industry than for discarding it.Crypto Innovation is Happening in the U.S.Many innovations are happening in the U.S. from individual entrepreneurs to large companies across a broad range of industries. The SEC can no longer turn a blind eye, fear, reject or dismiss cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. If they continue this path, they risk losing the IP battle to the Asian tiger once again.That starts with clarity \u2014 lawmakers and regulatory officials should be working together to ensure that cryptocurrencies are not wrongly and hastily categorized under decades-old securities law, but instead are allowed to thrive under sensible new regulation.Do you agree with Nethercutt?

Form W-2 refers to a document US corporations use to report employees salary payments to tax agency the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).According to a blog post January 16, Bitwage has been testing its new feature in beta mode since November. So far, it has one guinea pig \u2013 P2P cryptocurrency trading platform Paxful.\u201cAs a company that earns 100% of revenue in bitcoin, we are always looking for service providers who will accept digital currency.

The option to pay employees in cryptocurrency \u2013 whether in the form of their full salary or as a portion of it \u2013 has existed via Bitwage since 2014. In 2016, the company expanded its services beyond the US into Europe.More recently meanwhile, commentators have begun asking whether retail adoption of Bitcoin might hinge on more people choosing to receive their earnings in the cryptocurrency.Leading the argument was Francis Pouliot, CEO of an umbrella company which includes Bylls.com, a service allowing Canadian businesses to pay their bills in Bitcoin. \u201cMerchant adoption won\u2019t take off until people get paid in Bitcoin,\u201d he wrote on Twitter at the time.

But is there a path to get there? Possibly, according to Lucid Investment Strategies. Hang onto your hats though; it\u2019s going to be a bumpy ride.Five To One, Baby. One In Five.The world financial system has journeyed down an unsustainable path where unconstrained debt growth has become uncontrollable.Thus begins a new article charting Bitcoin\u2019s potential climb to a price of $10 million. As premises go, it\u2019s hard to argue with. Figures from The Institute of International Finance estimate world debt as around $247 trillion, and world wealth as $317 trillion. Significantly though, over the last 20 years, the debt has increased 394%, while the wealth only increased 133%.The rise to dominance of the Bitcoin standard is one of five options posited as potential resolutions of this situation. But it\u2019s the one we\u2019re most interested in, so let\u2019s ignore the other four.No One Here Gets Out Alive.At $10 million, Bitcoin could provide the world with a stable reserve currency, incapable of inflation or deflation. It would replace sovereign currencies, and represent the ultimate \u2018store of value\u2019. Of the five alternatives suggested, Lucid believes it offers a permanent fix, providing the greatest benefits, with the least collateral damage.But as it stands, Bitcoin\u2019s tremendous initial promise has been diminished by the thousands of copycat altcoins. These are crippling the entire space with their \u2018improvements\u2018 to the original, although regulators like the SEC are starting to draw distinctions between Bitcoin and the rest.So the \u201cnext big step in this journey will be the utter decimation of altcoins.\u201dYou Get Yours, Baby. I\u2019ll Get MineSo altcoins are dead, meaning demand for Bitcoin increases. As the \u201cmost democratic market-driven asset in history\u201d increased demand equals increasing BTC price 00. But first we need to bottom, which Lucid thinks will be below $1000. Sorry. But then\u2026the road will be clear up to $6,000. Above $6,000, there will be minor bumps at $7,500 and also at $8,500. The range between $10,100 to $11,100 will be the second major challenge. Above that, resistance will fall quickly. However, additional resistance appears at $13,750, and $17,500, which will be tested and overcome. New highs above $19,666 remain the final barrier.At this point Lucid foresees media frenzy. The road becomes smooth as hedge funds and family offices jump on board, and investors gain confidence. We see temporary hurdles at $50,000 and $100,000, but now market cap has taken $1.7 trillion from the worldwide stock market. Latecomers are forced to act.Gonna Make It, Baby, If We Try.Bitcoin begins to eat into the $7.5 trillion gold market. At $400,000 gold\u2019s market cap has been usurped. Earlier if gold prices go down as investors switch to Bitcoin.We now need three things to happen in order to reach $1 million. The developers must deliver the promised speed, transparency, and cost. Institutions must fully embrace Bitcoin. Regulators worldwide must determine that Bitcoin is a separate entity from any remaining cryptocurrency.This achieved, we have a clear run to $1 million. It is a serious asset and can no longer be ignored by even the most conservative institutions. We board the high speed shuttle to $10 million.\u2026Of course, we no longer own any significant amount. We all had our price to sell at. Now, Bitcoin is in the hands of central banks. It is their best chance to save the system and retain their power, according to Lucid.Do you agree with Lucid Investments?

So, if you\u2019re still trusting one with your private keys, you really ought to know better. But if you\u2019re too busy or too lazy to set up a hardware wallet for your funds, at least you should know where exchanges rank when it comes to cybersecurity. According to a report by CER and Hacken, not very well.Top 100 Crypto Exchanges by Cybersecurity ScoreCER and Hacken evaluated the state of the cybersecurity in the top 100 crypto exchanges by volume on CoinMarketCap as of January 1. What they found was a little disturbing.Without getting overly technical, for the sake of this study, cybersecurity means all the processes and technologies an exchange has in place to deter hackers from entering its system. An effective system, says CER, is one that reduces a hacker\u2019s chances of breaching it.Since crypto exchanges must be responsible for users\u2019 money and personal data, strong cybersecurity is imperative.Cyber Security Score (CSS) MethodologyTo measure cybersecurity at the top 100 exchanges, the companies checked whether they had sufficient user security in place, server security, and some kind of Ongoing Crowdsource Security Assessment (OCSA).When it comes to server security, factors cush as SSL/TLS certificates, secure cookies, and open ports come into play. If a hacker uncovers just one vulnerability in a server it is enough to compromise all the components and cause huge monetary losses.The user security level takes into account all the elements that exchanges can add to make it easier and safer for users entering and transacting on their exchange. These include things like 2FA, captcha, and strict password requirements.If there is no captcha, for example, hackers can easily uncover a user\u2019s password. 2FA significantly decreases the chances of an account being compromised since a telephone is needed as well as simply entering through one device. And when it comes to passwords they can simply be cracked with \u201cbrute force\u201d if they are too weak.Ongoing Crowdsource Security Assessment (OCSA) refers to whether an exchange has any processes in place to improve and develop their cybersecurity. This could be a Bug Bounty program that looks for white hat hackers to find vulnerabilities with the system, either in-house, or through a special platform like Hacken.Avoid These Exchanges If You Want to Keep Your FundsAccording to the research, the least safe of all the exchanges are:BithumbCoincheckZaifThese three exchanges all scored less than 5 out of a possible 10 points, based on the factors mentioned above. The safest exchanges are:KrakenCoinbase ProBinance and BitMEXOnly Kraken managed to achieve a score of above 9 out of 10, while Coinbase Pro racked up 8.74, and Binance and BitMEX achieved 8.50 each.Almost Zero Ongoing Programs ThroughoutOnly 13 percent of all exchanges have ongoing Bug Bounty programs in place to improve their security. Another major weak point for these top exchanges is their HTTP Security Headers with some 59 percent of exchanges missing 6-7 of the 7 headers required.According to Ledger CEO Eric Larcheveque, crypto is the easiest asset in the world to steal. So keeping your funds in an exchange is really not advisable.And as per the findings of this study, the top exchanges are among the lowest scoring when it comes to CSS, with Bithumb number 1 on CMC, and 98th in the CER top 100 crypto exchanges.Do you agree with the study\u2019s conclusions?

The company aims to build the first government-regulated lotteries to combine a True Random Number Generator and blockchain-based technology. By doing so, they\u2019d be able to rid the industry of one of its most pressing issues \u2014 lack of transparency in the drawing process. How it has managed to do so and what are the project\u2019s overall plan reveals its founder \u2014 Wojciech Lysak.1. What, in fact, is the GG World Lottery?GG World Lottery is our biggest and most ambitious project ever. We\u2019ve been working in the lottery business for years and we have a vast knowledge of its problems. We\u2019ve decided to create the world\u2019s first, government-regulated and licensed online national lotteries using blockchain technology and our True Random Number Generator, taking advantage of quantum physics as the source of randomness. Thanks to this development, they will be the first lotteries in the world providing full transparency of the draw process, thus solving the issue with its credibility at last. At the same time, GG World Lottery will connect all the national lotteries it\u2019ll be running. In general, it can be compared to the multi-state lotteries in the US or the Eurojackpot in Europe.2. What sets the GG World Lottery apart from the lotteries already offered on the market?Both the GG World Lottery and all the national lotteries take advantage of mobile technology. Tickets for our lotteries will be available on the lottery websites, but we\u2019ve also created applications for the most popular mobile operating systems \u2013 Android and iOS. This distribution model brings two distinct advantages. The first one is the convenience for the players, as they are able to acquire tickets at any time from any place, with just a few clicks using their smartphones. There\u2019s also the other side, the second advantage, this time for us, the operator. Full online distribution allows us to cut the costs significantly, without narrowing down the potential player base. Thanks to the funds we save by doing this, we can allocate a larger part of the income to the prize pool and also support local charities where we\u2019ll be running the national lotteries while increasing marketing activity. Put simply \u2013 we\u2019re creating a traditional lotto based on the 1/36 system, but with a completely new technological approach and distribution model.3. Why have you decided to gather funds for expansion with an STO?We\u2019re convinced that such a fund-raising method gets along great with our technological solutions and the use of blockchain technology. It also allows us to create a great investment opportunity for any regular internet user. What sets our token apart from countless altcoins is its functionality. It hasn\u2019t been designed as a speculation token, but as a form of digital investment that will become, in time, a source of passive income for the holder. This is thanks to the quarterly-paid dividends. Naturally, the holder will have the possibility to sell our token, as it will be listed on crypto exchanges after the sale ends. At the same time, we think that due to the relative short ROI time, it will be used as a source of a regular, additional income, without any need to take any action to profit.4. Let\u2019s focus on the blockchain technology. Will it replace the traditional verification process of the draw?Using blockchain technology allows us to provide full transparency and to rule out any possibility of data manipulations. This is why we\u2019ve decided to use blockchain along with the True Random Number Generator we have developed to finally solve the problem of the draw process fairness and credibility.5. Why Africa?There are several reasons. We have decided to start in Africa because it\u2019s possibly the most attractive market for our startup. It\u2019s worth noting that according to the latest analysis, despite the current stagnation of the world economy, African countries are expected to see substantial PKB rise in the next few years. Our solution is based on mobile technologies, and that\u2019s another important reason. In the 15 most developed African countries, more than 90 percent of the population has a smartphone and the continent is the fastest growing mobile market in the world. Apart from this, our CEO Mark Hutchinson has a great experience in organizing lotteries in these regions and know the specifics of these markets. All this combined makes Africa a great point for us to start. Next, we\u2019ll be moving to South America and Asia.6. \u201cReceive lifetime revenue share based on every jackpot win\u201d is the main slogan promoting your fundraising round. What exactly will be the source of income for holders?We\u2019ll be paying out dividends based on every jackpot win. For example: if somebody wins 10 million dollars, the investors share in the dividends equals 1% and the dividends itself are also 1%. The dividends are summed up for a quarter and paid out.7. The collected funds will be used for expansion to other markets or rather help in developing the product?The funds will be used up to speed up the scaling and expansion of our project. They will be used to cover the costs of marketing, legal and securing the first jackpots. The higher amount we\u2019ll collect, the faster we\u2019ll be able to roll out new lotteries and this will also drive up the amount of the dividends paid to the token holders.8. What is the certification of Gaming Laboratories International?Gaming Laboratories Certification consists of three stages: verification of the drawing machine source code, analysis of random data generated by the drawing machine and collecting the signatures of the development environment to ensure that the tested software is, in fact, the one used for the operation of the lottery. GLI certificates are necessary to work on some highly regulated markets. Apart from this, GLI also checks the randomness of the drawn data and the scaling methods (random number distribution), so we can be absolutely sure that our drawing machine doesn\u2019t favor any numbers. GLI report will be available at the end of January as we have currently passed two out of three stages and we\u2019re entering the final straight to receive the certificate.If you want to read more about the project or take advantage and invest in GG World Lottery\u2019s STO, you can do so on the official website.Stay tuned on the project\u2019s Twitter and Facebook pages in order to receive regular updates!What do you think about GG World Lottery?

At a Bitcoin conference in Miami, Kevin Connolly who plays Eric Murphy in Entourage made a surprise appearance on stage and announced that he\u2019s developing a new show called \u201cCryptos.\u201dWhat\u2019s even more interesting is that the producers of the show, Sords and King, who are both big blockchain advocates, seem to have modeled the plot after their own aspirations to take on Hollywood by using decentralized ledger technologies.Despite the current memefest on Twitter, this kind of show on Netflix or Amazon Prime can do wonders for mainstream awareness of cryptoassets and their power to disrupt centralized industries.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsShutdown: Day 31 | Days to Brexit 67China Hard LandingCrypto in WyomingPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of January 21st. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsLittle or no progress has been made in the UK or USA. Prime Minister May is apparently ceasing cross-party negotiations and instead re-focusing on the issue of the Irish backstop, previously a deadlocked issue. An increasing consensus that the odds are now rising for either a time extension on Brexit negotiations or even a 2nd referendum has the Pound Sterling Rising this morning.No such serendipitous optics have been presented for President Trump, however. The Democrats rejected a proposal from the White House that would compromise on DACA in order to fund the border wall. Now we\u2019re back to square one. It\u2019s been more than a month since the shutdown began and many government employees and contractors are already feeling the pinch.Today the US markets will be partially closed in honor of Market Luther King Jr. Day. In the good words of the great Reverend\u2026\u201cThe ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.\u201dChina\u2019s ChallangeAs was widely expected, the growth figures out of China this morning were extremely disappointing.There were some sprinkles of positivity buried under the headline though as both industrial output and retail sales came out strong. The feeling is though, that no matter what happens to the economy, the People\u2019s Bank of China will be there to inject further stimulus if needed and prop up the markets.Asian stocks did experience a tad bit of volatility at the time of the announcement (purple circle) but overall are taking this in good stride.European stocks, on the other hand, have not been performing particularly well today, and at the time of writing, indices are slightly in the red.Wyoming Crypto CountryEven though there are only about half a million people living in Wyoming the square state is quickly becoming a leader of bitcoin and blockchain legislation.A new bill has now been introduced to clarify the status of bitcoin and other crypto assets. The highlight, of course, is that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be given the same legal status as money.The state has also clarified the definitions of cryptoassets, very similar to the way the Swiss regulator Finma has almost exactly a year ago and divided them into three categories: Currencies, Securities, and Digital Assets (Utility Tokens).At this point, though the news is exciting the effects are rather limited. Wyoming is a small state and it\u2019s still not clear how the federal government will react to this. Certainly, if other states follow in their footsteps this can turn into something bigger but we\u2019re still very much in the early stages of the game.Nevertheless, this small step is a huge win for bitcoin and blockchain as it sets a great example of supportive legislation for the entire country and the entire world.Let\u2019s have an amazing week ahead.eToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

He stresses that the main challenge will be incumbent banks adjusting and adapting to the threat from fintech. Banks are only spending around 25% of their tech budgets on digital transformation and that\u2019s got to be higher.When asked if fintech and cryptocurrencies could become a serious threat to the stability of the economy and whether central banks need to look at that, he said:I\u2019m not so worried about cryptocurrencies\u2026 They fail the basic tests of financial services. They\u2019re not a great unit of exchange, they don\u2019t hold value, and they\u2019re slower\u2026 that\u2019s at the moment, but they\u2019re a threat.Cryptocurrencies Are a Threat \u2013 But Not Much of OneHe does make a small concession to crypto by saying that one of the BOE\u2019s largest challenges is regulation. Specifically, how to regulate certain new entrants to the banking system. However, when pressed a second time on Bitcoin and whether digital banking faces the same volatility issues, he brushes it off once more.There are risks from all these new challenges coming through but cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t high on my worry list.He\u2019s more concerned about keeping pace with fintech innovation, stressing that the main focus will be whether new fintechs can get their platforms ready and the customers onboard before the incumbents manage to adapt.Should bankers like Huw van Steenis be more worried about the cryptocurrency threat?

Last month, reports started circling that Huobi was planning post-Christmas tightening.Now, the company\u2019s exchange unit CEO, Livio Weng Xiaoqi, has confirmed the layoffs, saying:We do not know how long the bear market will last, so it is still possible that we will struggle to survive [\u2026] We have to plan in advance and spend money carefully.The company is apparently proceeding with caution as it plans to cut its unprofitable units like venture funding and news aggregation, adds Weng.In total, the company has cut about 100 positions in the past few weeks, currently sitting on a workforce of 1,300 people throughout the world.Huobi is not the only major cryptocurrency exchange to let people go.

Its previous announcements generated widespread criticism and even ridicule from the cryptocurrency industry.\u201cThe conclusions are, first, that Bitcoin counterfeiting via \u2018double-spending\u2019 attacks is inherently profitable, making payment finality based on proof-of-work extremely expensive,\u201d the latest paper\u2019s author Raphael Auer writes summarizing its contents.Second, the transaction market cannot generate an adequate level of \u201cmining\u201d income via fees as users free-ride on the fees of other transactions in a block and in the subsequent blockchain. Instead, newly minted bitcoins, known as block rewards, have made up the bulk of mining income to date.Lightning Network DoubtsAs such, Auer continues, when block rewards ultimately become zero, there will be insufficient momentum on the Bitcoin blockchain and it could take \u201cmonths\u201d to confirm a transaction. The conclusion ignores uptrends in fees, as well as the combined effect of off-chain scaling technologies such as the Lightning Network, which already permits considerable expansion Bitcoin\u2019s transaction processing capabilities.Auer mentions Lightning, but is broadly dismissive of it, saying:Second-layer solutions such as the Lightning Network might help, but the only fundamental remedy would be to depart from proof-of-work, which would probably require some form of social coordination or institutionalisation.In a predictable backlash, cryptocurrency advocates lambasted the findings, with The Bitcoin Standard author Saifedean Ammous repeating calls for the BIS to engage in debate on its perspective.Reminder that the BIS's head of research has time to give interviews on the flaws of bitcoin, but ignores my offer to debate these failings:https://t.co/iCYEet6VqN\u2014 Saifedean Ammous (@saifedean) January 21, 2019Other reactions gave some consideration to the report\u2019s logic.\u201cHave to give BIS credit for identifying a decent Achilles\u2019 Heel,\u201d one Twitter user responded. \u201cFee market incentives should work, but we can\u2019t throw it on a testnet to prove it.

Delayed decisions by the SEC on just about everything from the status of ICOs to Bitcoin ETFs hasn\u2019t aided progress.

It will fail to achieve mass adoption due to its limited applications.Millions of Investors Prove the Genius of BitcoinEither way says Friedman, the amount of investment poured into crypto from some of the most sophisticated global investors, demonstrates:The invention itself is a tremendous demonstration of genius and creativity, and it deserves an opportunity to find a sustainable future in our economy.Nasdaq is placing its faith in crypto. However, Friedman cites the missing ingredients (while somewhat at odds with a decentralized and apolitical global currency), are currently clear regulation and governance.She argues that investors remain at the gates due to a lack of oversight and regulation. But the winds of change are in the air.At Nasdaq, we are working to help cryptocurrencies gain investors\u2019 trust by offering our technology for trade matching, clearing, and trade integrity to start-up exchanges.

Reports indicate the move allows Go-Jek to expand its cashless service delivery across its plethora of service delivery platforms.Go-Jek Buys Majority Stakes in Coins.phAccording to TechCrunch, Go-Jek acquired majority stakes in Coins.ph in a deal worth north of $70 million. Announcing the move, Go-Jek CEO, Nadiem Makarim, said:Today\u2019s announcement marks the start of our long-term commitment in the Philippines and the continuation of our mission to use technology to improve everyday life and create positive social impacts.Go-Jek, currently valued at more than $10 billion is the first company in Indonesia to achieve Unicorn status. In 2o17, Fortune included Go-Jek in the Forbes list of 50 companies that changed the world. The company already has a major presence in Southeast Asia and intends to enter the Filippino and Malaysian markets.It is this international expansion drive that sees the company acquiring Coins.ph, one of the leading cryptocurrency and mobile payments platforms in the Philippines. In less than five years, Coins.ph has built a customer base of more than 5 million users. Back in December 2018, the company reported that it was processing over $6 million worth of transactions per month.For Ron Hose, the Coins.ph founder, the move signals the extent of the company\u2019s growth in the Southeast Asian theater. Starting in the Philippines, the company now has operations in Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam offering cryptocurrency and mobile payment services.Speaking to TechCrunch, Hose revealed that the company was in the midst of securing additional funding when the Go-Jek deal emerged. Commenting on the matter, Hose said:We had to make a decision on how we want to continue growing our business, and we felt like ultimately together with Go-Jek we could build something that is overall bigger and better for our customers.Go-Jek\u2019s Foray into Cryptocurrency Payments The Go-Jek multi-platform ecosystem comprises of several businesses in diverse business segments including ride-sharing, logistics, and digital payments, to mention a few.Through Go-Pay, Go-Jek already executes over 50 percent of the transactions in its ecosystem via cashless payment avenues. The Coins.ph acquisition will enable the Tencent-backed Go-Jek to introduce cryptocurrency payments to its customers across all these platforms.In many places across Southeast Asia, the majority of the population remains unbanked. More than 77 percent of Filipinos are unbanked, but a greater majority of people have access to mobile phones.Go-Pay CEO, Aldi Haryopratomo believes that there is a vast opportunity for the company to bring financial services to people historically disenfranchised in the global payment arena.Commenting on the deal, Haryopratomo, said:We are excited to work with Coins.ph, a company that shares our ethos of empowering communities by bringing more people into the digital economy. Consumer transaction behavior in Indonesia and Philippine share many similarities, and together with Coins.ph, we hope to have similar success in accelerating cashless payments in the Philippines.Meanwhile, cryptocurrency adoption appears to be making headway in the Philippines as well as other places in Southeast Asia. Back in September 2018, financial regulators in the Philippines began considering creating a legal framework for exchange platforms.Do you think this deal will bring payment service delivery closer to unbanked people in the Philippines?

De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) and the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) have regularly published press releases over the past period in which they warn investors and consumers of the risks of cryptocurrencies.

In its current form, the Bitcoin wallet constitutes something of a compromise; users will not hold their private keys, while the bank says it will provide insurance guarantees for up to \u20ac6,000 worth of funds.Rabobank had similarly surprised when it revealed its wallet plans, having also put out highly critical material on Bitcoin.For many cryptocurrency advocates, however, even custody \u2018solutions\u2019 such as ABN\u2019s cause frustration rather than celebration.Consumers\u2019 lack of control over their private keys, and hence actual control of the bitcoins, mean they are not actually embracing Bitcoin at all, some argue. In short, custodial \u2018ownership\u2019 of bitcoin goes against the reason why Bitcoin was created in the first place: removing trust and middlemen from money. Earlier this month, an event organized by entrepreneur Trace Mayer even attempted to spark the opposite effect \u2013 making Bitcoin users withdraw all their capital from trusted third parties.What do you think about ABN AMRO\u2019s Bitcoin wallet trial?

The latter, in particular, from the Ripple-army, who were quick to point out how easily XRP could achieve this (though whether XRP is trustless is a different argument).Compliant With Japanese RegulationsOne of the Crypto Garage partners must have some friends in high places because SETTLENET has already received regulatory clearance. Both the Japanese Financial Services Authority and the Cabinet Secretariat approve. This leaves the JPY-token well-placed to be a key driver in Japanese Bitcoin market liquidity.CEO of Crypto Garage, Masahito Okuma, said:SETTLENET together with Liquid makes trustless Bitcoin trading a reality, in a sustainable regulated environment. This is going to lead to a huge boost in Bitcoin liquidity in Japan and cement the region\u2019s place as a leader in the emerging Bitcoin industry.Liquid GrowthThe venture also marks the continuing growth of the Liquid Network sidechain since its launch last October.

According to the memo, cryptocurrencies do not constitute legal tender. Thus, businesses involved in the transfer of cryptos do not need to obtain an MTA.Furthermore, Section two of the MTA explicitly mentions the transfer of money for a fee or other form of consideration. Since cryptocurrencies do not constitute money, the Pennsylvania DoBS says businesses involved in transmitting virtual currencies need not obtain an MTA.The memo even highlighted web-based exchanges where customers might make fiat deposits, saying:These Platforms never directly handle fiat currency; any fiat currency paid by or to a user is maintained in a bank account in the Platform\u2019s name at a depository institution. Under the MTA, these Platforms are not money transmitters. The Platforms, while never directly handling fiat currency, transact virtual currency settlements for the users and facilitate the change in ownership of virtual currencies for the users.According to the memo, the Pennsylvania DoBS say the clarification was necessary to answer lingering questions from stakeholders.Back in 2016, Pennsylvania passed the HB 850, which defined cryptocurrency as money for the state\u2019s MTA laws. However, the House Commerce Committee amended the bill to remove the cryptocurrency as money definition.Cryptocurrency Does Not Constitute Money This recent statement from Pennsylvania regulators is similar to a memo released by regulators in Texas. At the start of the year, the Texas Department of Banking issued an update to its MTA guidelines stating that exchange platforms didn\u2019t require a license to conduct cryptocurrency transactions.However, unlike in Pennsylvania, Texas regulators issued some broad-based statements that classified a couple of cryptocurrency transactions as money transmission. These include the exchange of cryptocurrency for fiat via an exchange platform or Bitcoin ATM.Other states like New Hampshire have also enacted laws excluding cryptocurrency transactions from money transmission laws. Meanwhile, places like New York, North Carolina, and Oregon among others either have their specialty cryptocurrency business regulations (for example, BitLicense) or generally classify them as money transmitters.Should cryptocurrency be classified as money?

But in-game items, such as skins, must be paid for using the in-game currency V-Bucks.

Epic Games, who develop Fortnite, brought in a profit of $3 billion in 2018, and the game\u2019s popularity shows no signs of waning.Meanwhile, Banks are constantly in the news for being either complicit in money laundering or negligent in their monitoring.In contrast, authorities are successfully seeking out and prosecuting those who try to use Bitcoin for money laundering. It clearly can\u2019t be as simple a job as scaremongers would have us believe.

The bill will also provide a precise classification of digital assets, especially for custody administration. Cryptocurrency to Have the Same Legal Status as MoneySponsored by Sen. Tara Nethercott (R-WY) along with five other state Senators and Representatives, the proposed bill titled \u201cDigital assets-existing law,\u201d calls for the proper classification of virtual assets. The bill also seeks to create a legal framework for virtual asset custody via banks instead of other financial institutions.According to the bill, virtual assets fall under three categories: securities, assets, and currency. The bill sponsors believe that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin fall under the currency category giving them the same legal status as money.7/ That treatment solves what some called #bitcoin's Achilles heel\u2014that old liens may pop up years later & hurt owners.

This classification also extends property rights to cryptocurrency owners removing the need for intermediaries in peer-to-peer transactions.Concerning Cryptocurrency CustodyConcerning custody, the bill seeks to create a framework for banks to act as qualified custodians of digital assets. Based on this framework, banks will offer digital asset custodial services akin to the type provided to mainstream securities.Thus, banks offering such services will do so according to the SEC\u2019s Custody of Funds or Securities by Investment Advisers. This means that such banks can offer cryptocurrency custodial services nationwide, which will be a step towards solving one of the nagging issues in the digital asset industry.9/ #Wyoming banks would have option to OPT INTO an enhanced regulatory regime for digital asset custody which meets #SEC #CustodyRule requirements, incl surprise audits.

A cool climate and a shed-full of cheap hydro-electric power attracted speculators from as far away as China.

While at the same time, the public backlash caused some authorities to take measures such as increasing electricity costs for miners.But Douglas county has taken an alternative tack.Speculate To AccumulateAuthorities there see huge potential in all the high-speed computing power and blockchain expertise leftover from the boom. By repositioning itself as a center of blockchain excellence, Douglas county hopes to benefit as the technology revolutionizes other industries.Lisa Parks, executive director of the Port of Douglas county explains:There is more to the cryptocurrency story than the boom and the bust. We have some unique assets that make our region appealing\u2026 Let\u2019s figure out a way to capitalize on it.But the proposed \u2018Blockchain Innovation Campus\u2019 is only part of the picture. In order to entice new development in the blockchain industry, Douglas county continues to encourage its existing cryptocurrency miners.Bucking The TrendUnlike neighboring Chelan and Grant counties, which essentially priced miners out of the market with energy-cost hikes, Douglas\u2019s rate increase was far more modest.The result of this has been continued investment from new mining operations. In November, Bitmain opened a $20 million mine in the region, near the town of East Wenatchee. And the county is trying to revive the mining operations of GigaWatt, which had become an unfortunate poster-boy for the area\u2019s Bitcoin bust.While some might expect a once-bitten twice shy attitude, having previously been burned, local authorities have a different outlook. As the next iteration of blockchain continues to develop, such an outlook should see them well placed for the next phase.There is, after all, trusted wisdom in not throwing out the baby with the bathwater.Will Douglas Country\u2019s economy benefit from supporting the blockchain industry?

Commenting on the matter, she explained:We [the SET] are not in a hurry to enter the digital asset trade, as some companies are still managing their core businesses, while cryptocurrencies are just one of the [digital] asset classes.

Beginning in mid-2018, the government via its Finance Ministry and the Securities and Exchange Commission began creating a legal framework for the digital asset industry.For Dilokrungthirapop, the SET stands a good chance of obtaining the license based on its significant capital pool and status as a trusted exchange operator.

In November, he suggested the Bitcoin price would shoot to $2 million in 2019 after bottoming in the $1,500-$2,000 range.Russia Launches Cryptocurrency TrialsIf true, the new-found fondness for Bitcoin would add to the seemingly contradictory stance taken on cryptocurrency by Russian officials in recent years. A combination of local bans and warnings mixed with flashes of bullish support have created a confusing gray area for investors in the absence of official regulations for much of the space.This week, however, ministries revealed they had sanctioned tests of cryptoinstruments for settlements, prior to signing regulations into law by the end of February.The scheme, local news outlet Izvestiya reports, aims to assist lawmakers in constructing \u201cnecessary laws\u201d to govern the emerging sector. Last week, Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the financial markets committee at Russia\u2019s state parliament the Duma which now supports the crypto tests, also revealed plans to issue a blockchain-based version of Russia\u2019s ruble by 2022.\u201cThe opinion is that this ruble will not differ in any way from the fiat ruble, except that it will exist on the Blockchain,\u201d he told the media.What do you think about Vladislav Ginko\u2019s predictions?

WeeklyBitcoin price 00 closed the week at $3536, with the decline on Sunday largely reversing the gains made through the week.Despite making lows on Sunday at $3481, a bounce back to a close at $3542 meant avoiding a new 2018 candle close low, with the weekly candle forming an inverted hammer, which is considered a relatively bullish sign.Despite this, Bitcoin is still stuck in no man\u2019s land with initial significant resistance overhead at $4,050 and support at $3200.DailyThe daily chart shows a slightly clearer picture, illustrating that Bitcoin does have some preliminary support at $3500, which is now coming under some pressure and likely to be retested again at some point this week despite there being early signs of a tweezer bottom early on Monday morning.The more concerning factor for the bulls is the continued declining resistance which ultimately suggests that any bullish move will be capped between $3700 \u2013 $3800 where there will be significant short interest.This would imply that there is likely to be a test towards the lows at $3200s where we last saw significant buying interest and strong historical support when Bitcoin fell from $5,000 to $3,000 during 2017.The question will be if it is tested, could it go on to complete a W shapedbottom or Adam and Eve, or will we look to new lower lows in this bear market.4 HourThe 4 hour chart shows that should there be a further decline, there may be a pit stop at the $3350 range which is the 78.6% retracement level from the move from the previous lows.If tested, a strong bounce here would be a positive sign for the bulls but the main task remains; to break the declining resistance and the $4,000 handle.All oscillators are drifiting sideways and not really adding anything for the analysis so are not shown on that basis.Market SentimentAs reported previously, the balance of market sentiment remains bullish, with the leveraged bull positions out weighing the bears by 1.4:1, which is not positive for a bullish narrative while the price is declining.As we have seen in previous senarios like this \u2013 the bulls are essentially exposed, which leads the author to believe that a hard test of the low $3,000s is likely given what has happenedTrade Bitcoin, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

The idea of a cryptographically secure decentralized ledger lay the foundation for the founding of bitcoin. It was not until the rise of Ethereum a few years ago, however, that the true potential of decentralized apps really began to gain steam. The world was slowly coming around to the benefits of transparency, automation, and the seamless and trustless verification of exchange that decentralized applications, or DApps, promised. [Editor\u2019s Note: This article has been guest authored by Saad Mohammad.]These benefits are what fueled the crypto boom. They resulted in countless projects raising untold millions to \u201crevolutionize\u201d everything from fintech and healthcare to education, government, transportation, social media, agriculture, and everything in between.Then reality struck.While cryptocurrencies still hold the promise of making systems of every type faster, more efficient, more transparent, and more reliable, the crypto market as a whole had slowly morphed into one fueled by speculation, not actual development. For example, this report highlights the fact that thousands of crypto projects, promising a revolution in their specific industry or niche, did not really deliver anything of value.There has simply been too much speculation with regards to coin, token, project values, and what these various projects actually intend on developing and delivering. Furthermore, the wider public simply did not, or does not, understand what they are getting into when they invest in such initiatives. Although the crypto space grew slowly over time, it very quickly ballooned by several hundred billion to over $700 billion in value by late 2017. Maintaining hundreds of billions of dollars in spurious valuations that were supported by crowdfunded crypto projects that did not necessarily follow clear audit, financial, or governance protocols and that did not as yet actually deliver or produce anything of value was simply not in any way sustainable. The exponential growth of the crypto space, without a commensurate growth in actual value-added services and adoption that could give those valuations a sound and realistic basis, needed to be reined in.To put it another way, in the eyes of regulatory bodies, all of the above meant that crypto projects did not operate in the interest of the public, so regulation was necessary. This is why we have seen the SEC refuse numerous exchange-traded fund applications (ETFs), official bans or tightened crypto regulations from the central banks and governments of countries as diverse as India and South Korea, and the market subsequently shrinking to a fraction of its size from about a year ago.While these developments may put off the speculative investor, not all is lost. According to Peter Du, a prominent Asian investor with Du Capital, there are still silver linings to the story. Take the now delayed Ethereum upgrade that was scheduled to take place a few days ago. Ethereum, one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies today, is undergoing the upgrade to change the way the Ethereum network functions.Since hundreds of projects function on Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, this upgrade will have a ripple effect in which we may see many coins and tokens being marginalized. However, over time, it is the discerning investor that will prevail. What is more important than speculative booms and busts is the long-term consolidation of the crypto market as a whole; the development of useful tools and services that can be mass adopted and implemented on a wide scale will do more for cryptocurrencies in the long run than the latest fad or flavor of the month that baselessly promise to disrupt an industry.While speculation is still rife in the crypto space, we\u2019ve all had an opportunity to learn a valuable lesson over the past year or so. Can cryptocurrencies revolutionize the way the world works? Yes, they most certainly can. Will they? Yes, they most certainly will, but not overnight. What we need to realize is that nothing works in a vacuum, and there is no such thing as an overnight success; crypto\u2019s unimpeded fall from all-time-highs a year ago are proof of this.Real value comes from delivering services of real value, and you have to operate in the real world, with real customers, within real limits, and in a collaborative fashion between developers, investors, users, and policymakers.We either all win together, or we all lose together. Blockchain is perhaps the single most revolutionary technological innovation since the microchip, one that can impact the globe on a level rarely seen before. As Mr. Du says, not all is gloom and doom. SEC regulations, dropping crypto prices, instability in the market, and reports of uncertainty and doubt are nothing but growing pains for this market. It is the government pumping the brakes, trying to come up with policies and rules that can help regulate this rapidly advancing technological space. It is DApp developers realizing that they cannot get away with crowdfunding millions but not delivering anything of value. It is the ecosystem as a whole realizing that we need all the right building blocks in place before we can deliver on promises of revolution.Are things slow now? Yes, most certainly. But once everything is in place, blockchain will show that you truly cannot stop an idea whose time has come.[Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article do not represent the views of Bitcoinist or any of its team members.

The framework, once finished, will define the activities which will fall under the organization\u2019s jurisdiction.One of the points in the FCA\u2019s guidance addresses the high risks of leveraged derivatives such as Contracts for Differences (CFDs). According to the Guidance, their risk is associated with \u201cthe volatility of crypotassets and the impact of product fees such as financing costs and spreads.\u201dAdditionally, the document outlines that there are difficulties when it comes to pinpointing their exact value because of \u201clack of transparency\u201d in price formation of the underlying digital asset.The FCA is committed to consulting on potentially banning the sale of certain cryptocurrency derivatives to retail consumers and transferable securities, which are linked to certain digital assets.The matter was addressed before by the financial watchdog. In April, the FCA announced that they will \u201clikely\u201d require authorization.According to the latest release, the talks of whether or not to ban certain crypto derivatives will be held later this year.\u2018Do No Harm Approach\u2019 IntendedAs per the guidance, the FCA doesn\u2019t intend to impose additional barriers to entry but merely to increase investor\u2019s protection and regulatory clarity.We have tried to make sure that our Guidance is as clear and complete as possible so we don\u2019t create inappropriate barriers to entry, or conflicts with our aims and objectives.Furthermore, the FCA will also consider stakeholders\u2019 feedback.Speaking on the matter, Christopher Woolard, the executive director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA, said that while the market is still relatively small, it\u2019s vital for consumers to be aware of the protections they\u2019ll be able to benefit from.Earlier in 2018, the UK set up a task force to further investigate the challenges the industry is facing. Now, in line with the same task force, the FCA has categorized cryptoassets into exchange tokens, security tokens, and utility tokens and other intended purposes.While the FCA is trying to come up with a regulatory framework for cryptoassets, Bitcoinist reported that Huw van Steenis, Senior Advisor for Bank of England, does consider them to be a threat.What do you think of the FCA\u2019s aim to regulate cryptocurrencies?

To coincide with the start of the World Economic Forum 2019 in the Swiss ski resort of Davos on January 21, the development charity published its annual report on the state of the world\u2019s economy.[Editor\u2019s Note: This is a sponsored guest contribution authored by Nir Yaacobi, Economics Lead at GoodDollar.]The headline-grabbing finding from the research was that 26 of the richest people on the planet own as much, in terms of assets, as the 3.8 billion people that comprise the poorest half of the globe\u2019s population.This time last year the figure released by Oxfam was that the wealthiest 42 people owned as much as the poorest 3.7 billion. That statistic is used on the landing page for GoodDollar, a research hub that explores how decentralised cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology may enable models based on universal basic income (UBI) with the central aim of reducing global wealth inequality.Need for change: GoodDollar\u2019s website homepage is now out of date following Oxfam\u2019s latest statistics showing the wealth inequality gap is wideningNeed for change: GoodDollar\u2019s website homepage is now out of date following Oxfam\u2019s latest statistics showing the wealth inequality gap is wideningThe figure needs updating, to reflect the worsening situation, alas. As Oxfam\u2019s 2019 report summary states: \u201cOur economy is broken, with hundreds of millions of people living in extreme poverty while huge rewards go to those at the very top.\u201cThe number of billionaires has doubled since the financial crisis and their fortunes grow by $2.5 billion a day, yet the super-rich and corporations are paying lower rates of tax than they have in decades.\u201cThe human costs \u2014 children without teachers, clinics without medicines \u2014 are huge. Piecemeal private services punish poor people and privilege elites.\u201dThe accompanying press release points out: \u201cBillionaire fortunes increased by 12 per cent last year \u2026 while the 3.8 billion people who make up the poorest half of humanity saw their wealth decline by 11 per cent.\u201dThe report promotes the urgent need for a new system. \u201cWe need to transform our economies to deliver universal health, education and other public services.\u201dAt GoodDollar, we believe blockchain-powered UBI is the right tool to help fix what the report calls \u201cinequality at home [with] developed nations currently failing to meet their overseas aid commitments [that] could raise the missing billions needed to tackle extreme poverty in the poorest countries by increasing taxes on extreme wealth\u201d.Simply put, a new decentralised mechanism is critical to tackling wealth inequality \u2014 and sooner rather than later, with many economists predicting another global financial crisis before long.If the wealth transfer from the rich countries to the poor ones is operated by governments and authorities in individual countries, with their own interests at heart, then this approach is likely to finance the public administration in the rich countries and corrupt regimes in the poorer nations. Very little will arrive its destination.\u201cUpwards of 30 per cent of funds allocated to humanitarian aid is lost to corruption,\u201d points out Ira Ryk-Lakhman, GoodDollar\u2019s General Counsel, in a recent guest article on Cointelligence. \u201cThis is mind-blowing. Other estimates calculate that over 80 per cent of the funding that is allocated for charities does not make it to the final beneficiaries.\u201dA new way of thinking is needed to right the balance; GoodDollar and other decentralised, blockchain-backed UBI programmes should be explored. For instance, GoodDollar, once established, will cut out the middleman \u2014 in this case a government or custodial authority \u2014 and hand funds directly from the rich to the poor.We believe that with the right decentralised tool the very rich people will be willing to donate more of their funds if they know it is destined for the right cause, rather than for a new tax that they will always find a way to avoid. Change has to come, and together we can narrow the wealth inequality gap.Do you have the skills to help the GoodDollar project? We need builders, scientists, and experts in identity, privacy, and financial governance, as well as philanthropists and ambassadors.

Luckily, voucher-based solutions like Azteco feel the same and they\u2019ve made BTC as easy to buy as topping up your phone credit.Kill Your ConfidentialityBitcoin has a (undeservedly) bad reputation; for enabling money-laundering, dark-web narcotics purchases, and countless other illegal activities despite not really doing that.In an attempt to clean up Bitcoin\u2019s act, various third parties have legislated, regulated, and otherwise hampered exchanges with KYC and AML hurdles. But isn\u2019t this in effect sterilizing Bitcoin, and robbing it of one of its original USPs?The vast majority of users don\u2019t like the associations with money-laundering and criminality. And of course, the vast majority of money-launderers aren\u2019t using Bitcoin as their medium of choice, particularly since every transaction is transparent on the public ledger.Nobody is suggesting that the anonymous transfer across borders of millions of dollars is acceptable. But should it require a passport to send a few hundred bucks for an Australian friend\u2019s birthday?At The MomentOf course, we have the option to use a Bitcoin ATM (within certain limits). The number of BATMs doubled in 2018 for the third year running, taking the total worldwide to over 4000. But that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s one near you. For comparison, there are 65,000 standard ATMs in the UK alone.They are also a fairly pricey option, in part down to the cost of equipment, from $1000 per unit to significantly higher. And initiatives such as incorporating BATM machines into Coinstar change machines, seem to be suffering the same (or worse) KYC issues as exchanges.Voucher In PocketAzteco (and startups Bitnob and Fastbitcoins) have an alternative voucher-based solution. Azteco actually first sold Bitcoin in Shoreditch, London in 2014. The best news is, it requires no specialist (or expensive) equipment other than a Mac or PC based POS system.Simply pop into your local shop and buy some bitcoin (with cash naturally), and you will receive a printed receipt with a voucher code. Then point your browser at the Azteco website; enter the voucher code and wallet address where you wish to receive the funds, and voila! Even my granny could do it, and she (sadly) passed away many years ago.This may seem similar in principle to the recent introduction of bitcoin sales at French Tabac shops. However, that requires registration to redeem vouchers, whereas Azteco\u2019s solution doesn\u2019t require your personal information.Although the technology has been around for a while, word is slowly starting to spread, and Azteco is finding new fans daily.Max Keiser was certainly impressed following a recent meeting with the company, tweeting that \u201cThis is the on-ramp the industry is gagging for.\u201d\u201cThis little Azteco printer replaces Bitcoin ATMs,\u201d he explained. \u201cMerchants anywhere in the world can easily sell Bitcoin.

The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has put out a new research paper that explores the economics of intervention into bitcoin\u2019s blockchain.To be clear, the BIS is the bank of central banks and is the world\u2019s oldest global financial institution, so it is in effect the exact middle-man that bitcoin was designed to disrupt. It currently stands to be the biggest loser should cryptocurrencies gain mass adoption. Or, the biggest beneficiary, should they decide to embrace the new technology. So it\u2019s good to see they\u2019re taking this seriously.The author, Raphael Auer, has previously advocated the healthy regulation of the cryptoasset space and is extremely knowledgeable about blockchain. In fact, the new paper describes quite perfectly how a 51% attack might play out and even gives a meticulous formula detailing in the attacker\u2019s incentives.However, the paper makes no attempt to discern the actual numbers to be plugged into their formula. So, even though the BIS seems to be indicating that bitcoin is susceptible to such an attack, current estimates of the costs would be around $7.25 billion for the hardware and another $5 million for the electricity.Auer\u2019s analysis also concludes that the economics of bitcoin will be very different once bitcoin reaches its maximum supply of 21 million coins, which is expected to happen in the year 2140 and that if there are no significant changes until then the network will be unsustainable. On this point, I completely agree!!Though my assumption is that the network certainly has the capacity to make the necessary adjustments over the next 120 years until that happens.At first glance, it might seem as if the BIS is taking a critical stance against Bitcoin by pointing out its vulnerabilities. However, in my view, such research only serves to strengthen the network. Only by fully exploring bitcoin\u2019s weaknesses can we act to strengthen them.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsShutdown: Day 33 | Days to Brexit 65IMF Confirms Global SlowdownIs Crypto Manipulation Real?Please note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of January 23rd. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsGlobal markets are once again tasting fear. Trade talks between the US and China seem to have taken a turn for the worse and though the current treaty in place until March 1st has not been violated, the rhetoric is escalating.The Bank of Japan meeting didn\u2019t get a great reception from investors this morning. It seems that despite its extremely aggressive intervention in the economy, inflation is still well below expectations.The Japanese Yen declined moderately against the US Dollar, presumably on the assumption that the BOJ could bolster its current course and inject even more money into an already over-stimulated economy.Slowdown ConfirmedThis headline kind of speaks for itself and is very likely influencing sentiment today.This is the second IMF downgrade in 3 months.Crypto Manipulation?Those of you who\u2019ve been following my twitter probably noticed that we\u2019ve been taking a hard look at market conditions lately.Though this poll was done in a rather unscientific manner, the sentiment of those who did participate is pretty clear\u2026Of the 41 comments, it seems that most people think there is a combination of factors at play here\u2026Following this, we actually had an amazing opportunity to analyze the conditions at play yesterday as bitcoin experienced a 3% flash crash that lasted about 15 minutes from drop to full recovery.What\u2019s interesting about this graph is the role of the key level of $3,500. As we\u2019ve been discussing, bitcoin has been trading in a tight range between $3,500 and about $4,100.So when the downside broke, it very likely took out a lot of stop losses, causing a chain reaction of stops and liquidations. What\u2019s exciting about yesterday\u2019s move is that the direction was quickly reversed and in the aftermath, we even saw a mini-rally. This is a very positive sign and could very well indicate that we\u2019re at or nearing bitcoin\u2019s price floor.I did manage to comment on this in real time in an interview with BloxLive.TV. You can catch the recording here. (My segment is at timestamp 7:45 of the recording.)In short, the word \u201cmanipulation\u201d implies intention and we have no evidence of that. What we see here are the clear effects of a low liquid market. The same conditions that have caused bouts of extreme volatility throughout bitcoin\u2019s short history.

Pseudonymous isn\u2019t good enough, and generally speaking, modern databases are pretty good at what they do. However, some projects are making strides towards making data on the blockchain more opaque for enterprise. Blockchain proponents claim the distributed technology behind bitcoin could improve supply chain management, quality assurance, accounting, smart contracts, improve trust in transactions, and potentially the voting process of shareholders.But, despite this potential, companies have generally shied away from adopting the technology. Switching systems over to blockchain would be very expensive, and corporations would naturally do research and development before making any such decisions.Blockchains Are Not Private Enough for EnterpriseFull nodes are responsible for validating transactions and blocks. But, in order to do this, each full node has access to the blockchain transaction data itself, making this information publicly available.In short, blockchains contain data that does not link transactions to a specific individual, but, with enough cumulative data, researchers could deduce who is whom on the blockchain.There are already big companies who do just this, such as Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis firm that recently found \u2018whales\u2019 were not the largest source of bitcoin price volatility. This could undermine the privacy (and security) of some users, particular major corporations for whom privacy is so important. They don\u2019t want spying competitors to learn their trade secrets, reveal customers\u2019 personal information etc.The New York Times covered how pseudonymous location data can simplify identification, allowing malevolent entities, private companies, and governments to follow transactions on the blockchain.Since the blockchain is theoretically immutable, if an address you\u2019ve used to conduct private business is made public as one of your own, then the transaction history will forever be publicly known. This is a particularly big problem for organizations who are regulated when it comes to the data of their customers. (think GDPR and the California Privacy Act)Indeed, privacy coins have been around for several years now, such as Bitcoin Dark and Monero. But, companies are looking for something different.Let\u2019s take a look at some of the projects attempting to make blockchain technology more enterprise-friendly.IBMIBM is working on offering private and confidential transactions on its enterprise solution, Hyperledger Fabric.\u201cData confidentiality mechanisms ensure that individuals or organizations are prevented from accessing data that they are not authorized to access, such as classified information of other organizations\u2019 transactions,\u201d writes Elli Androulaki, Sharon Cocco and Chris Ferris for IBM. \u201cAnonymity requires that participants of transactions are concealed.\u201dIt\u2019s not exactly clear how IBM is improving upon the already existing encryption in the databases companies currently use. Without that important information, it might lead an enterprise considering blockchain to stick with their old-fashioned databases that keep things confidential as is \u2013 barring a hack.AmazonAmazon Web Services (AWS) and Kaleido want to create an \u201ceasy button\u201d so businesses that can start taking advantage of distributed ledgers. Towards this end, Amazon introduced Hyperledger and Ethereum templates.\u201cIntroducing Kaleido to AWS customers is going to help customers move faster and not worry about managing blockchain themselves,\u201d AWS said in its statement.Kaleido offers a full-stack SaaS for creating, operating and scaling enterprise blockchain solutions,\u201d writes Amazon about its AWS Marketplace. \u201cFar beyond AMI scripts, Kaleido accelerates the entire journey from PoCs to live networks with rapid member onboarding, hardened enterprise scale, analytics, and flexible shared IT governance.\u201dThe likes of Amazon and IBM have competition from blockchain-centric startups, too.MedRecMIT\u2019s MedRec calls itself \u201ca network, not a service.\u201d Currently, a pilot project with the Beth Israel Deaconnes Medical Center, the open-source platform creates an authentication log for the governing of medical record access. Medical researchers provide \u201cthe mining\u201d that secures and sustains the authentication log on a \u201cprivate, Ethereum network.\u201d\u201cElectronic Health Records (EHRs) were never designed to manage the complexities of multi-institutional, lifetime medical records,\u201d writes MedRec. \u201cAs patients move between providers, their data becomes scattered across different organizations, losing easy access to past records. As providers \u2014 not patients \u2014 are the primary stewards of EHRs, patients face significant hurdles in viewing their reports, correcting erroneous data, and distributing the information.\u201dIt adds:The situation is much like consumer finance, where an individual may have several bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and assets but no unified way to access and control them. In the case of finance, however, there is an infrastructure in place that greases the wheels: currency. With medical information, we are still in the age of barter.Zagg/DigitalBitsAn open-source project focused on maintaining privacy within the enterprise blockchain environment, called the Zagg Protocol, acknowledges that transparency of account balances across nodes \u201coften presents an unworkable situation within an enterprise environment.\u201dZagg notes that state channels, which represents a two-way channel between users (or a user and a machine) that allow for state-altering operations off the blockchain, don\u2019t offer total privacy.The project planned to build on Stellar but recently announced it chose DigitalBits as a partner due to its privacy features (and its being backed by the largest wallet provider in the Stellar ecosystem, Lobstr). Zagg claims that existing UTXO-based privacy blockchains don\u2019t support complex coding or smart contracts.ZAGG\u2019s Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKS) ensure secure and private validation while avoiding double-spending. Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptography based privacy technology. In a ZKP, one party proves to another party that certain states on a system are true without revealing certain information.While traditional blockchains detail a sender and receiver\u2019s address and the amount transaction, ZKPs do not reveal or share information other than the boolean of whether it is valid or invalid and were perhaps first made popular in the blockchain industry when Zcash 00 incorporated them into their cryptocurrency.PolkadotPolkadot is working on a solution to enable different blockchains to communicate with each other. Designed to create interoperability between chains, the idea here is that smart contracts and applications on Polkadot could one day seamlessly transact with data and assets on other chains.Parachains would be a major component of Polkadot. Used to gather and process information and pass that information to a relay chain. The information would then be passed to \u201cBridges\u201d, which connect back to a base-blockchain, like Ethereum.MESGMESG is working on connectivity and interoperability between blockchains, as well as blockchains with non-blockchain technology. Developers would be able to use a marketplace to monetize open-source code, the startup claims.\u201cIntegration and adoption issues are not directly linked, but they share a common problem,\u201d Anthony Estebe, MESG CEO, told Forbes. \u201cBlockchain adoption is hard because for now, the user experience is still terrible, but if there are more ways to connect blockchains to the existing world that will help a lot user experience.\u201dLambdaLambda, a blockchain-based storage network, is developing two features it claims will make blockchain palatable to enterprise: Provable Data Possession (PDP) and Proofs of Retrievability (POR). Both are intended to produce an immutable and secure solution for storing, accounting for and exchanging large volumes of data across more than one party.The company\u2019s CEO, Lucy Wang, claims that Lambda incorporates access control via multi-authority attribute-based encryption (MA-ABE).Details about how all of this works, like with too many blockchain startups, are sparse.Blockchain Might Not Be The Right SolutionThe applications of asset tokenization in enterprise range from prevention of double-spending to the automation of tasks. But before its full benefits can be realized in an enterprise setting, organizations will need to be confident that their enterprise blockchain lacks the transparency so often coveted by crypto-proponents.That is perhaps why banks are trying to develop private blockchains on their own. The above-mentioned Hyperledger might be one example. Another is R3, a distributed technology consortium comprised of the world\u2019s biggest banks.Completely private blockchains allow companies to control and protect their IP better than a public ledger \u2013 or so the thinking goes. In fact, these companies might still decide that they don\u2019t need blockchain at all in their businesses \u2013 whether it be a private or a public blockchain.Their decision might ultimately hinge upon how many nodes exist and how they\u2019re distributed. A public blockchain like Bitcoin has thousands of nodes making it much more tamper proof and resilient to attack.Private nodes, on the other hand, will have a lot less as the number of participants on exclusive networks will be much smaller, which may defeat the entire purpose of choosing a blockchain over a database.Blockchains are not plug and play, it takes years upon years to establish these decentralized networks. Trial by fire is the only way to prove the validity and security of a new network.\u2014 \u0243itConsultants (@BitConsultants) January 22, 2019With this in mind, a blockchain might be useful for enterprises where there could be some potentially untrustworthy participants on the network. A centralized database controlled by a single entity is otherwise much more efficient, and the potentially untrustworthy participants would be excluded by default.Will enterprises eventually find a use-case for blockchain technology?

Necessity being the mother of invention, Bitcoin Venezuela are developing a mesh node little larger than an SD card.A Hot MeshMesh networks are a hot topic right now.

Bitcoinist recently reported on the experiments of a Kiwi Bitcoiner using GoTenna and Samourai Wallet to send offline transactions.But that\u2019s all well and good in leafy New Zealand.

The Turpial mesh node device requires only a battery to enable anyone to send messages or Bitcoin transactions in the absence of internet or mobile signal.Of course, even a mesh network must eventually find some kind of access to transmit the information to the Bitcoin network.Mesh You UpLuckily, Bitcoin Venezuela also has that covered, with the larger Harpia device. This acts as a mesh node, can run a full Bitcoin and Lightning Network node, and connect to Blockstream Satellite. With one of these in the mesh, this means that transactions can be initiated and transmitted to the network without any reliance on local state infrastructure.Bitcoin Venezuela are looking for funding of $50k to pay for 3 months of developer time, in order to finalise and market-ready the devices. A $1k donation will bag you three of the Turpial nodes; enough to set up a mesh network in your living room.Exciting times ahead for the technology, as shared on Twitter by Blockstream CEO, Adam Back.#Bitcoin mesh nets brewing\u2026 https://t.co/A7VrxpKDbO\u2014 Adam Back (@adam3us) January 21, 2019What do you think about local mesh networks for transmitting Bitcoin transactions?

After several delays, hopes were high that a positive decision would emerge in Q1 this year. Now, commentators note, this deadline ceases to exist.Speaking to mainstream media, VanEck Associates\u2019 Jan Van Eck explained that the current state of the SEC due to the ongoing US government shutdown meant negotiations would only reopen at a later date.\u201c\u2026We were in discussion with the SEC about the Bitcoin-related issues; custody, market manipulation, prices \u2013 and that had to stop,\u201d he told CNBC.\u2026Instead of just trying to slip through, we had the application pulled, and we will refile and reengage in the discussions when the SEC gets going again.Bitcoin Doesn\u2019t CareUnlike previous ETF-related decisions, the news appeared to have little effect on the Bitcoin price 00 losing just 0.8 percent in the 24 hours to press time Thursday. Over the past six months, opinions have meanwhile become more suspicious over the benefits an ETF would have on Bitcoin long term. While lay investors traditionally claimed its introduction would boost the cryptocurrency\u2019s clout through institutional exposure, others were bearish, conversely arguing non-custodial investing and potential rehypothecation would ultimately hurt Bitcoin.In August last year, veteran cryptographer Nick Szabo added his weight to the latter camp, saying:I for one am not lobbying for an ETF or for Wall Street-managed money in general. It might cause more problems than it\u2019s worth.Similar reactions also began appearing following news of the withdrawal, UK-based traidng platform eToro\u2019s senior market analyst Mati Greenspan describing the event as \u201cgood\u201d and a \u201cpower move\u201d on the part of VanEck.The SEC itself appeared to be in two minds about the VanEck/ SolidX proposal.

For WON, crypto and blockchain technology, like the Internet can cause a paradigm shift in technological advancement as a whole if channeled to the right application.Thus, WON wants to create a comprehensive decentralized network that utilizes the technology in a way that creates benefits for all participants without any of the harmful by-products of present-day adoption cases. All of its actions will be based on guidelines developed to ensure both economic and technical motivation.Apart from pursuing an altruistic agenda, the WON project doesn\u2019t intend to lose sight of the technical aspects of blockchain implementation. Part of this drive is the creation of actual use cases for virtual currencies. WON will encourage third-party application developers and companies to produce useful applications on its platform.On the whole, WON seeks to position itself as the panacea to the lingering issues plaguing the emerging virtual currency movement. These problems typically center around theft (hacks), unlicensed security token offers, lack of mass adoption, and wastage.The WON EcosystemThe project ecosystem contains three critical stakeholders whose interactions contribute to the general community. These stakeholders are WON Inc., community users, and third-party developers (TPD).Each of these participants plays a vital role in ensuring that the project actualizes its aims and objectives. WON Inc. is responsible for setting the ball rolling by creating one billion WON tokens (\u0174) and several other functions pertaining to running and securing the cryptocurrency.Third-party developers enter into service agreements with WON and then create useful dApps. These dApp creators can also produce their local cryptocurrency for use in the dApps \u2013 third-party Developer Coin (TPD DC). Community users refer others while also interacting with the plethora of applications on the blockchain thus expanding the project\u2019s network effect.WON FeaturesWON is both an open blockchain that can handle millions of transactions per second (WON Open Blockchain \u2013 WOB) and a platform for TPD creators to build their dApps (WON Platform). However, unlike other public blockchains, WON incorporates numerous advanced features.WOB is a Byzantine fault-tolerant proof-of-authority blockchain. It is WOB that is responsible for creating \u0174. WOB utilizes dynamic sharding and robust know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) protocols. There are no ICOs or airdrops on the WOB.WON combines wallet and converter functionalities to allow both third-party developers and consumers to buy/sell \u0174 cryptocurrency. The platform also features top-of-the-line commercial grade APIs.WON TokenomicsEverything begins with the \u2018Genesis event\u2019 \u2013 the creation of the 1 billion \u0174 which will be owned 100 percent by WON. The project will keep a large part of all pre-mined \u0174 in cold storage and out of circulation for between one to four years.\u0174 will mainly serve as a medium for transactions among different cryptocurrencies on WON. A small amount of \u0174 will be used as incentive payments to community members. The tokens will also be used as fees for all manner of transactions on the blockchain.Users can convert all accepted cryptocurrencies to both \u0174, as well as DC. Depending on the value of \u0174 tokens. An essential part of the WON economic model is to encourage greater utility for third-party dApps on its blockchain platform.The \u2018Community Generation Event\u2019 also creates 100 billion DC for the project\u2019s first TPD, Topgames Inc., who\u2019s behind the game, Evony: The King\u2019s Return. Like with the Genesis event and \u0174, no more DC will be created for that particular TPD after the community generation event.DC\u2019s function like the native currency for each TPD environment. Assuming the third-party dApp is a game, players can convert DC to the one they need among themselves and purchase in-game items. Furthermore, not only the players can convert their DC to another Third-Party Developer\u2019s DC through \u0174 which acts as a medium, but also they can withdraw unused DC to fiat in some jurisdictions. Which is believed to be a great incentive for players to top up the game they are playing.All the while, the flow of DC for each TPD is being tracked, monitoring their respective network effect. This provides a means of determining the popularity of each TPD\u2019s application.For WON, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is intended to offer comprehensive technical and social benefits. The project plans to carry out the WON Genesis event at the beginning of year 2019.What do you think about the WON project\u2019s drive to promote positive value creation thereby reinventing the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology narrative?

The $3500 Price level was tested on Tuesday by the bears who managed to push the price down around $100, before seeing a strong 5% swing back to $3600, which may have been posturing by algorithmic trading to determine the strength of the market at lower prices.Yesterday saw confirmation that the Van Eck/Solid X Bitcoin ETF proposal was temporarily withdrawn, which failed to see the market react, suggesting that the anticipated denial of the proposal was already built into the market price to some extent.Daily ChartThe daily chart largely remains unchanged, with Bitcoin consolidating above preliminary support of $3500 on low volume and remains in the weekly range between around $4000 and $3200.The 200 Week moving average currently standing at $3300, looking ominous and favours being tested (given we are in a bear market), with there being little evidence that there are any significant buyers at $3500. That being said, there are also clearly a lack of sellers at these prices which explains the missing volume.4-Hour ChartLooking to the 4-hour chart for clues, it is slightly easier to see the market structure. The downward channel that bitcoin is locked in has some minor resemblance of a falling wedge with some bullish divergence on the RSI. This would fit the narrative of there being buying interest below.As The RSI has shown relatively recently in this scenario, a directional break from its current tightening range, may give us an early signal as to where this market will ultimately chose to go.Bull vs. Bear CasesSome of the more bullish commentators are pointing out that a strong reversal at these levels would push the market back up towards $4k and show evidence of bottom pattern which, if it broke above key resistance at $4050 and maintained support, would ultimately open the door to prices as high as $5k.Overall however, the bulls are up against declining resistance, declining volume and remain in a bear market.While there is likely to be some reaction with any test at $3200, the bulls are already leveraged long as illustrated by Bitfinex data, with bears not interested at selling \u2013 yet.Should we continue to observe the market to drift sideways with failure to make a higher high above $4050, the descending triangle will be in play with a target of around $2,000 looking likely.Trade Bitcoin, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

Half a Billion in Trading FeesAccording to a recent report by Korean media Sporbiz, China-based cryptocurrency exchange Huobi has raked in a total of $483 million USD in commissions throughout 2018.The report suggests that this is more than the commissions earned by Binance \u2013 the leading exchange by trading volume, which raked in $462 million.

The latest blockchain company to catch investors\u2019 eyes is Symbiont, a New York startup bringing blockchain tech to capital markets.2019 The Year of Institutional InvestmentBitcoinist reported yesterday that Nasdaq is positively bullish on bitcoin. Ahead of Davos, Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman stated unequivocably that cryptocurrencies would play an important role in the future. She even predicted that bitcoin could become a global currency.Now the world\u2019s second largest stock exchange Nasdaq Ventures initiative is taking the lead in Symbiont\u2019s series B funding round.

Despite a torrid 12 months with as much as 90 percent of value wiped off of some altcoins. Blockchain Technology Called into QuestionAccording to Symbiont CEO Mark Smith, this much-needed backing from Wall Street comes not only during the crypto winter but at a time when blockchain technology is being called into question as well.After an overhyped 2017, 2018 left people\u2019s expectations deflated like a helium balloon after a children\u2019s party. Smith told Bloomberg that we were now entering a much more \u201crealistic phase\u201d about what blockchain can and cannot do.We are leaving the peak of the hype cycle and entering the trough of disillusionment, especially for people who inappropriately applied this technology hoping it would become a panacea for solving all their problems.From finding a cure to cancer to eradicating corruption in the supply chain, blockchain was the solution. However, it\u2019s becoming clear that while the technology is undoubtedly important, its uses are limited\u2013for the current time.What Makes Symbiont a Good Bet?Symbiont\u2019s smart contract platform Assembly allows financial institutions to verify and share data. By using smart contracts, the company aims to make the mortgage bond market more efficient. It also plans to speed up times for syndicated loans. As well as the backing of Nasdaq, Citi, Novogratz, and Jim Pallotta\u2019s Raptor Group Holdings, Symbiont has also teamed up with Vanguard Group Inc. This will be an important partnership that will enable investment giant Vanguard to apply blockchain tech to update the index data behind mutual funds. Symbiont will use the funds to improve their data management process and work on private equity, mortgages, and syndicated loans.And as for Nasdaq? The world\u2019s second largest stock exchange will be looking into opportunities to capture new clients who want to tokenize assets and use smart contracts through Symbiont\u2019s Assembly platform.

But with Lightning Network performing much the same functions for Bitcoin, are these altcoins really necessary any more? Not so much, according to figures from online retailer Bitrefill.Fill Her UpBitrefill originally just sold mobile phone top-ups online, but added gift-vouchers for sale in July 2018. The range of vouchers available (from Amazon to Uber to Hotels.com) meant shoppers could then purchase virtually anything with cryptocurrency.While initially just accepting bitcoin, Bitrefill added altcoin payments (in dash, dogecoin, litecoin, and ether) back in 2016. It was also one of the first retailers to add Lightning Network functionality, in early 2018. At the time, there weren\u2019t even user-friendly wallets available for LN.Coming From BehindDespite being the last \u2018alternative\u2019 payment method to the party, LN now accounts for more payments than any of the altcoins. According to Bitrefill\u2019s John Carvalho:It\u2019s actually double most of the altcoins.As a recent guest of The Bitcoin News Show, he explained that around four percent of daily sales are now made through Lightning payments. Whilst on-chain bitcoin payments still make-up the bulk of sales, this is more than any altcoin on most days. He also said that the number of Lightning payments was increasing almost daily.Feel The Might Of ThorCarvalho also discussed Bitrefill\u2019s recently announced Thor service. This allows customers to open an empty lightning channel connected to Bitrefill\u2019s well-connected node for a small fee. The channel connects to a lightning wallet, allowing the holder to receive bitcoin (for example as tips) instantly and with near-zero fees.This is an easy tool to get started accepting lightning payments. The alternative is to manually ask someone to open a channel to you, or open a channel yourself and make some outgoing payments. Maintaining an open channel requires bitcoin loaded in your lightning wallet, but it is tricky to achieve this in the first instance.Bitrefill are seeing a great deal of interest in this product, showing that Lightning Network has the support, and could indeed live up to its potential as an altcoin killer.Will Lightning network make altcoins obsolete?

The deadline for a decision was February 27th but VanECK has now withdrawn its application.Diligent readers of our daily market updates will not be dismayed by this latest update but delighted. As we have noted several times, this proposal had a very slim chance of success. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has been stressing that the bitcoin market is not yet mature enough for an ETF.Recent price action seems to confirm this, as we\u2019ve seen a number of price spikes due to the low liquidity lately.The government shutdown seems to have put further strain on this process. If there was a hope of convincing the SEC before the deadline, it has now disappeared. So, rather than letting the application be rejected, VanECK has simply withdrawn it \u2014 thus denying the SEC any opportunity to deny it. This is what we call a power move.The price of Bitcoin did decline slightly at the time of the news (purple circle) but is still holding well at the $3,500 support level.The markets lackadaisical response to this news is a clear sign that investors are starting to understand\u2026The crypto market is not dependent on any government or financial institution and no single product or service has the power to make or break bitcoin.

Blockstream first launched its network earlier in 2018. The user-originated message was possible thanks to the release of a dedicated API this month.Currently in beta, the implementation uses the Lightning Network testnet to pay fees, meaning the message also used testnet coins to broadcast itself. Blockstream says a mainnet transfer will occur following a \u201cperiod of successful testing\u201d of the API.\u201cAll that is needed to receive a broadcast is a satellite dish (a TV satellite dish will suffice), a few low-cost components, and a computer,\u201d the company explained about receiving messages last week.

A Hole in the PlotAccording to a new Messari report, the total circulating supply of XRP 00 is 21.8 billion. This differs significantly from data provided to third-party crypto data services such as CoinMarketCap, where the displayed circulating supply is around 41 billion XRP at the time of writing this.The same is true for the cryptocurrency\u2019s total market capitalization. The report suggests that the real market value of XRP is $6.9 billion against the widely reported $13 billion, based on the current USD-XRP exchange rate.The report outlines that Ripple hasn\u2019t shared any methodology or reference exchange data it uses in order to calculate the trading volume of XRP.Additionally, more than 99% of the trading volume is apparently coming from overseas exchanges, where many of them have been suspected of wash trading.Where Does the Difference Come From?The reports states that 19.2 of the 41.0 billion XRP currently quoted as \u2018in circulation\u2019 may either be illiquid or subjected to \u2018\u201dsignificant selling restrictions.\u201dThese include 6.7 billion XRP locked up on selling restrictions on co-founder Jed McCaleb.An additional 5.9 billion XRP has been publicly committed but not donated to RippleWorks by the co-founder Chris Larsen.The report also estimates 2.5 billion XRP held under selling restrictions on the wallet addresses of RippleWorks.Lastly, the 4.1 billion XRP, which are sold through the company\u2019s money services business called XRP II since 2016, could also be subject to re-selling restrictions.What is more, the report also says that these estimates may be \u201cconservative.\u201dPersistent Sell-Side PressureThe \u201cilliquid\u201d XRP, as quoted by Messari, combined with the 59 billion XRP that\u2019s held on Ripple\u2019s own balance sheets, could create \u2018persistent sell-side pressure\u2019 on the market, according to the researchers, depending on the structure of the above selling restrictions.Additionally, Messari is not the first to draw attention to Ripple\u2019s valuation. Earlier this month, Bitcoinist reported that hedge fund chairman, Bill Miller, expressed concerns over Ripple, calling its XRP token \u201cway overdone.\u201d He explained:The XRP thing doesn\u2019t have to be used on the Ripple network; you can use other things\u2026 If you look on Coinmarketcap.com it says there are 38 billion of them but there\u2019s actually around 100 billion because the company has retained 61 billion on their own balance sheet.In the meantime, talking to CNBC\u2019s Arjun Kharpal at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Ripple\u2019s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, argued that XRP is more scalable and faster than Bitcoin. Nevertheless, he admitted to still owning bitcoin as it\u2019s likely not going to zero.The reason?

Guaid\u00f3 is familiar with cryptocurrency technologies and has been promoting Bitcoin since at least 2014.Venezuela\u2019s Interim President a Fan of BitcoinBecause of the severe economic crisis afflicting Venezuela for several years, Bitcoin has been used as a safe-haven asset, allowing many Venezuelans to escape hyperinflation.In this regard, Guaid\u00f3 has been propagating information about Bitcoin 00. For example, in August 2014, he announced via Twitter the launch of Bitcoin exchange Plataforma Sur Bitcoin. This was the first exchange allowing Venezuelans to buy bitcoins using Bolivars, the local currency.Venezuela's Interim President, @jguaido, was tweeting about #Bitcoin in 2014.

The Petro is a digital currency that president Nicolas Maduro imposed to address the economic crisis in February 2018. The idea was to back up this cryptocurrency, controlled by the government, with Venezuelan oil and other mineral reserves.In this regard, in August 2018, Bloomberg wrote,Venezuela\u2019s Maduro carried out one of the greatest currency devaluations in history over the weekend. To make things more complicated, the new bolivar\u2019s value will be linked to a cryptocurrency.Guaid\u00f3 fought vigorously against the Petro, considering it an instrument used by the Maduro\u2019s administration to defraud the Venezuelan people.\u201cActing Venezuelan President is a fan of Bitcoin,\u201d said Max Keiser in reaction to Guaid\u00f3 becoming interim president of Venezuela.Good news. Maduro\u2019s Petro was never gonna work. Converting economy over to Bitcoin would be the smartest thing they could do.Bitcoin-based transaction volumes most likely will continue to soar, as more facilities to buy and sell the cryptocurrencies are made available to Venezuelans. For example, the first Bitcoin ATM will be installed in the next few days.Since January 5, 2019, Guaid\u00f3 has been serving as the President of the National Assembly of Venezuela. In addition to the U.S., as of this writing, his claim as the country\u2019s interim president has been recognized by the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala.

Ultimately, BTC price 00 bottomed out before a period of accumulation and sideways trading, which set up the bull market of 2016/2017.This bull run culminated in the mid-December 2017 all-time high (ATH) of about $19,700. Since the start of 2018, BTC has been in another prolonged downward spiral. Unless BTC stages a significant recovery, February 2, 2019, will mark a new record for the longest Bitcoin price correction.$BTC correction record:On Feb 2nd, we are likely to break the record for longest Bitcoin correction: 410 days (from Nov 2013 to lowest price at Jan 2015)Very soon, you will be able to say that you survived the longest crypto market correction in $BTC history pic.twitter.com/Mag1Nq5tyo\u2014 Josh Rager \ud83d\udcc8 (@Josh_Rager) January 24, 2019History Repeating Itself?Recently, market analysts like Josh Rager and Galaxybtc have taken to Twitter, talking about the impending record and the implications for the market. For Galaxybtc, if history does repeat itself, then BTC is likely to start a new bull cycle sometime between the fall and winter 2019.Giving credence to this theory is the notion that Bitcoin is parabolic an examination of BTC\u2019s logarithmic price action shows a similar setup between 2013-2015 and 2018-present. BTC fell more than 80 percent during the price rout during both periods.\"The future lies in the study of the past\"We're approaching the 420 day mark which ended the 2015 bear market and if history repeats itself, we're moving towards several months of accumulation and a new bull cycle starting mid-late 2019. $BTC #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/VX8ok9oFue\u2014 Galaxy (@galaxybtc) January 14, 2019However, while the charts paint a similar picture for both periods, the market awareness appears vastly different. Bitcoin is no longer an obscure asset but a major topic along economic, political, and social lines.This increased market awareness has brought on greater regulatory scrutiny in the market as well. A lot of the focus is on market manipulation, which some commentators say has been responsible for many of Bitcoin\u2019s sharp price spikes.BTC Bottom and Reward for HODLersIf the cyclical price pattern is to continue, however, BTC must establish a long-term bottom. When Bitcoin first fell to $6,000 back in February 2018, talk of a bottom price dominated the discourse in the industry. During the mid-November 2018 slide, BTC price resisted two attempts to go below the $3,000 mark.1/ Let's go on a little journey. What if the history does indeed rhyme? pic.twitter.com/VDSonz68Gw\u2014 Murad Mahmudov \ud83d\ude80 (@MustStopMurad) January 13, 2019For Bitcoin analyst, Murad Mahmudov, it is more a situation of history rhyming than repeating itself. According to Mahmudov, the BTC bottoming out process has two final legs; baby capitulation and final capitulation.Expanding on Mahmudov\u2019s reasoning, Woobull.com creator, Willy Woo presented a chart on Friday supporting the narrative of two more declines before BTC bottoms out.Back in November 2018, BitMEX chief, Arthur Hayes predicted a prolonged bear market that could last 18 months at the time. He also pegged his BTC bottom between $2,000 and $3,000.The 2013-2015 bear market gave rise to the term \u201cHodl,\u201d which has become perhaps the most iconic term in Bitcoin lingo. For Bitcoin enthusiasts, the hope will be that history repeats itself with BTC reaching a new all-time high probably in 2021 and 2022 after the next halving sometime in May 2019.The silver lining for Bitcoin holders, however, can be found in the Bitcoin dominance index. The figure has actually risen throughout 2018 from an all time low of 33 percent when price was at its peak to roughly 52 percent today.Do you think history will repeat itself with Bitcoin seeing a new all-time high in the near future?

He suggested that some central banks have \u201cvery limited ammunition,\u201d while others perhaps had a bit more flexibility.Lagarde concurred that,It would be very nice if the economies at large didn\u2019t have to rely on the central banks yet again in order to resist the next shock.She singled out Mark Carney of the Bank of England, and Jay Powell of the Federal Reserve, as two of the very few central bankers who have a little bit of space to maneuver in the wake of the next downturn.Complete Reforms While The Going Is GoodBoth Lagarde and Ermotti suggested that it was important to complete reforms while the economic environment is good. Central Banks took unprecedented measures to stimulate lending and economic growth after the 2008 crash (by printing a record amount of money).However, a belief that this fallback will always be there, can lead to complacency, meaning critical reforms are never implemented.Ermotti said that countries must \u201ctake the bitter medicine\u201d and implement changes that would benefit their citizens. Lagarde urged policymakers to \u201ctake the right course of action\u201d on reforms. Although work had begun, this in some cases barely scratched the surface. It is essential to complete these critical reforms and that they go deep enough.Fintech Is Going To Shake The SystemLagarde concluded by saying that banks needed \u201cpurpose\u201d beyond just the single-minded pursuit of profit. She warned against complacency regarding fintech, which includes virtual currencies and bitcoin, that she said would \u201cshake the system.\u201dRepeating her view that a regulated fintech with AML measures and consumer protections was a positive force, she continued to say that many large banks realized this, and were either incorporating fintech companies or moving in the same direction themselves.Of course, Bitcoin didn\u2019t exist at the time of the last financial crisis. In fact, it was \u2018spawned\u2019 as a direct response to it, according to ECB Executive Board member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9.Meanwhile, adoption is always accelerated by national economic failures and unrest. The next global financial crash could provide a key momentum swing, leading to the eventual collapse of banks that have indeed become complacent with their monopoly over money creation.Do you agree with Lagarde in the disruptive power of fintech?

To the President\u2019s dismay, 6 Republican Senators voted in favor of the Democrats\u2019 budget proposal.Some think that this could urge the president to come back to the negotiating table.

The Fed often claims that they\u2019re \u201cdata dependent.\u201d However, with the parts of the government responsible for reporting retails sales data, housing, and GDP figures out of order, the Fed has little to go on.Some economists feel that given the lack of data, the Fed may have no choice but to take a dovish stance, which could indicate that they won\u2019t hike rates any time soon.Whatever the reason, stocks are pushing higher today\u2026The Mood at DavosAccording to professor Schiller, he\u2019s seeing a lot more ideologues at this year\u2019s event and fewer business types.

Bitcoinist | Jan 26, 2019 | 06:00 Share Tweet Send Share The lottery industry managed to generate a total of $273 billion in ticket sales throughout 2017. However, despite being an international, multi-billion dollar market with unparalleled opportunities, its existing state is far from where it could be. Doubt, uncertainty, lack of transparency \u2013 these are just a few of the issues which are riddling it. But how can they be solved?Old-Fashioned ApproachesLegacy lotteries have managed to introduce new products fairly regularly, which is admirable. However, instead of increasing revenue, it seems like topline revenue sales come at the expense of existing games.Additionally, it\u2019s also important to note that there is a more challenging, demographic problem hovering over the horizon. Millennials aren\u2019t buying lottery tickets at such a high pace as older generations used to and this is bound to take its toll on the market.In an attempt to tackle these issues, GG World presents a solution where traditional, brick and mortar outlets are left aside. Instead, it takes advantage of modern technology which is perfectly functional on mobile markets. Not only does this allow the project to reach the less-developed market, but it also resonates with the millennial mentality.The thing is that millennials rely on their phones and on technology a lot more. Yet, lotteries are seemingly slow to catch up. That\u2019s where GG World comes into the picture.Lack of TransparencyAnother pressing issue which is currently riddling the market is the lack of transparency and the growing concern of people regarding the actual randomness of the draws.A broad range of platforms is using pseudo-random number generators. They are also commonly audited by questionable authorities, which quickly ignites the sparks of doubt and uncertainty.In order to tackle these issues, GG World implements two particularly important components.First off, the platform is the very first to use a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) on a blockchain. The TRNG itself is intended to guarantee the true randomness of the draws, while the blockchain layer brings the much-needed immutability and transparency.On the other hand, in order to tackle the challenges related to auditing transparency, the project is closely monitored by Gaming Laboratories International. This is a world-class gaming certification business.Losing the Personal TouchApart from all of the above, another important thing to consider is that legacy lotteries are continuously losing any kind of personalization they might have had. With billions of tickets in sales, it feels like the emphasis is put solely on the profit, rather than on the user.GG World is tackling this issue by bringing back the personal feeling to the lottery. Every participant in the project\u2019s STO will be entitled to receive a lifetime revenue share which is based on every single jackpot prize win.This way every time someone wins the jackpot, all the token holders will win with him.You can read more about the GG World Lottery project and participate in its STO on its official website.Should you have any questions, don\u2019t hesitate to ask away in the project\u2019s Telegram channel.What do you think of GG World Lottery\u2019s way of handling the issues currently pressing the lottery industry?

Boxer Floyd Mayweather famously backed the Stox ICO, and has subsequently been in trouble with the SEC for other crypto-endorsements.Stox Of EthereumAccording to the NIS 17 million ($4.6m) lawsuit, the investor sunk $3.8m worth of Ethereum into the ICO. This was based on promises made in the white-paper, which claimed that the company would invest $30m of funds raised into developing its prediction market platform.The Mayweather-endorsed ICO, held in August 2017, raised $34m, but the lawsuit claims that only $5m of this was invested into the company. Hogeg invested the rest, it claims, in other ICOs such as that of Telegram.In addition, the investor accuses Hogeg of selling his own Stox tokens 00 before he promised, thus devaluing all tokens.Spending SpreeOne of Israel\u2019s highest-profile crypto-entrepreneurs, Hogeg also faces charges of misappropriating funds in another company he controls. He denies both the charges, which follow a mightily impressive spending spree last year.In June 2018 he reportedly bought $19m worth of land in a wealthy suburb of Tel Aviv. Two months later, he splashed out $7.2m on Beitar Jerusalem, one of Israel\u2019s top football clubs.Not content with this (and perhaps seeking some lasting recognition of his \u2018greatness\u2019), he donated $1.9m to Tel Aviv University. Well, he donated it to establish the \u2018Hogeg Institute for Blockchain Applications.\u2019(May)Weather The StormThe Stox ICO marked Mayweather\u2019s first foray into crypto-promotion. He later endorsed a further two ICOs, netting him $300,000. Sadly, one of these, Centra Tech, was later found by the SEC to be a scam, and the founders charged with fraud.This shone a light on Mayweather\u2019s own involvement, and the commission charged both Mayweather and DJ Khaled for failing to disclose that their endorsements of the ICO were paid promotions. Mayweather settled the charges by agreeing to pay $300,000 in disgorgement, $300,000 in penalties, plus interest, and receiving a 3-year ban from future securities promotions.Unfortunately for Mayweather, his woes do not end there. His name also appears in a class-action lawsuit against Centra Tech, its founders, and celebrity endorsers.He must be hoping upon hope that he can remain uninvolved in this latest suit.Images courtesy of Shutterstock, Bitcoinist archivesThe Rundown Stox Of EthereumSpending Spree(May)Weather The Storm"}

The analysts at the American multinational investment bank and financial services company found that the production-weighted cost per bitcoin averaged just above $4,000 worldwide in Q4 2018.Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $3,587.30 per coin, at the time of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap. The current price is therefore approximately $500 under the analysts\u2019 determined production-weighted cost.Winners and LosersThe takeaway from this price differential is that only the most cost-effective mining operations are currently coming out on the winning end.As noted by Bloomberg, Chinese mining operations that operate at low-cost have the ability to mine Bitcoin at around $2,400 per coin \u2014 thanks to contracts with electricity generators. Only those with agreeable arrangements with electricity producers are able to take advantage of such low-cost BTC mining.Unsurprisingly, the analysts concluded that high-cost Bitcoin producers will likely have little choice but to unplug. However, one should not fall victim to buying the doom and gloom \u2014 as various regions in the world are still seeing an increase in mining operations.Hash RateBitcoin\u2019s hash rate has been steadily rising since reaching a low in December of last year, following the market leading cryptocurrency\u2019s price drop from major support above $6,000 to prices above $3000.December also saw the Bitcoin difficulty adjusted by one of its largest decreases in history, which correlates with the hash rate chart.Winners: Low-Cost Chinese MinersRegarding said price drop, the analysts stated:The drop in Bitcoin prices from around $6,500 throughout much of October to below $4,000 now has increasingly pushed margins further and further negative for just about every region except low-cost Chinese miners.These low-cost Chinese miners continue to remain in the strongest and most profitable position for Bitcoin mining, as the marginal costs for said operations could feasibly drop to below $1,260 per coin.What do you think about JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s findings?

XRP sales decreased in the fourth quarter of 2018 while trading volume increased. $535 Million in Total XRP Sales for 2018 According to the report, Ripple sold a total of $535.56 million in XRP tokens for 2018 as a whole. Of this figure, $171 million or roughly a third came from institutional buyers while more than $363 million came from sales via third-party market makers.As for the fourth quarter of 2018, Ripple reports that it sold 129.03 million worth of XRP. This figure is over 20 percent less than the sales recorded in the preceding quarter which stood at $163.33 million.One likely cause for the decline is a contraction in direct institutional sales by Ripple II; the company\u2019s licensed money transmitting arm. In Q4 2018, Ripple II sold $40.15 million, less than half the sales figure for Q3 2018 ($98.06 million).Sales via Ripple\u2019s money transmitting subsidiary tend to cater to institutional buyers. Such transactions usually have some restrictions put in place to prevent huge swings in volatility.The report also showed an increase in programmatic XRP sales (via third-party market makers). Ripple recorded programmatic XRP sales to the tune of $88.88 million in Q4 2018 compared to $65.27 million in the previous quarter.In total, the company sold $535.56 million in XRP tokens for the whole of 2018.Despite the decrease in Q4, XRP trading volume actually increased. Global XRP volume for the fourth quarter of 2018 stood at $54.8 billion, a 44 percent rise from Q3 figures.Recently, other sources have revealed that Ripple may be overstating the market capitalization and circulating supply of the XRP token. The report which brought the findings to light also alleged that the recorded XRP trading volume might be manipulated via wash trading by overseas exchange platforms.Growing XRP UtilityConcerning adoption, Ripple reports that there is a growing utility for the XRP token, especially with cryptocurrency exchange platforms. XRP is now listed on more than 100 platforms globally, according to the market report marking a 100 percent increase compared to the end of 2017, which stood at 50.Furthermore, the company says the token is finding more utility as a base pair at nine exchanges including Binance, the world\u2019s leading exchange by trading volume.The findings also touched on xRapid, the company\u2019s cross-border payment solution which went live on October 2018.

Gold has always been a hedge against other markets in times of financial uncertainty.During the Bitcoin (BTC) bull run on 2017, however, gold saw some of its investors flock into the first and foremost cryptocurrency in search of massive gains. Now, some of those investors are reportedly switching back. Van Eck explained on CNBC\u2019s \u201cETF Edge\u201d last week:I do think that Bitcoin pulled a little bit of demand away from gold last year, in 2017. Interestingly, we just polled 4,000 bitcoin investors and their number one investment for 2019 is actually gold. So gold lost to bitcoin and now it\u2019s going the other way.This isn\u2019t particularly shocking, as traders and speculators are wont to go where they anticipate making a profit. With the markets looking shaky this tax season, it has already become clear that many are moving their wealth into precious metals.That said, there remains significant overlap in those who actually \u2018invest\u2019 in Bitcoin and those who actually \u2018invest\u2019 precious metals. Though the former is new and the latter is ancient, both currently maintain a position as a hedge against (or alternative to) fiat currencies and attract investors who have little faith in central bank-issued paper and/or the governments that borrow it.Investors are likely flocking to precious metals as the charts seemingly suggest that a generational bottom may be in \u2014 especially for something like silver, which has been in a bear market for a prolonged period of time but appears to be on the verge of a monthly breakout.Meanwhile, many in the cryptocurrency space believe that Bitcoin is near its bottom, which may be reached in the first half of 2019. Should this happen, it might not be much of a surprise to see more speculators flood back into the fast-moving digital asset.What do you think about the Bitcoin-versus-gold debate?

The Wall Street giant also believes Bitcoin isn\u2019t a safe haven despite outperforming the S&P and Dow Jones over the past decade. JPMorgan: Bitcoin Only Valuable in a DystopiaIn a note to clients published last week, JPMorgan analyst Jan Loeys poured cold water on Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition. Loeys, who is also JPMorgan managing director said that the top-ranked cryptocurrency would only have real value in a dystopian situation.A portion of the report reads:We have long been skeptical of cryptocurrencies\u2019 value in most environments other than a dystopian one characterized by a loss of faith in all major reserve assets.According to Loeys the emergence of extreme economic situations like market slumps or recessions isn\u2019t enough to increase Bitcoin\u2019s usefulness.The JPMorgan analyst says that there are easier to use instruments with greater liquidity for investors to call upon in such times. Admittedly, printing money out of thin air and using it to bail out insolvent banks would indeed be much simpler for JPMorgan.In other words, it really depends on who you ask when determining if your economy is \u2018dystopian\u2019 and whether Bitcoin would be valuable for them.In places like Venezuela and Iran, for instance, citizens have been relying on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to survive. In 2018, when the Chinese government ramped up its currency devaluation drive, wealthy citizens reportedly bought Bitcoin en masse to safeguard their money.Prolonged Bear Market Undermines Bitcoin as HavenCommenting further, Loeys opined that the prolonged cryptocurrency bear market makes Bitcoin an unsuitable haven asset. This assertion comes even as there is a consensus among analysts on the absence of correlation between BTC 00 and traditional assets.According to Loeys:Low correlations have little value if the hedge asset itself is in a bear market.One issue with the JPMorgan report is the selective data used to reinforce its position. In one instance, Loeys backs up the \u201cBitcoin is a weak haven asset\u201d argument by pointing to the fact that cryptos underperformed equities during the stock market\u2019s ten worst months in the last eight years.However, this analysis rings hollow when put side-by-side with the fact that Bitcoin has outperformed the S&P, DOW, and NASDAQ over the last decade. Within that period, the world\u2019s most poular cryptocurrency survived multiple 85 percent drops.REMINDER: Warren Buffett hasn\u2019t beat the S&P with Berkshire over the last decade.#PeskyFacts pic.twitter.com/v4WK2bt5ox\u2014 Pomp \ud83c\udf2a (@APompliano) May 5, 2018Do you agree with the assertion that Bitcoin only has value in a dystopian situation?

But even if you\u2019re opting out and blocking cookies, you\u2019re still being tracked. According to a group of privacy advocates in Europe lead by Brave privacy browser, advertisers can even track victims of sexual abuse.GDPR Not Stopping Behavioral AdsBehavioral advertising has become a sort of trade-off between consumers and companies. With ad fraud costing companies more than $16 billion in 2017, non-human (or bot traffic) is at its highest point. Advertisers understandably want to ensure they get more bang for their buck (and real people to target).To address this constant menace in the advertising industry, big players in ad-tech can assure advertisers they\u2019re reaching real humans. They can instantly match them with interested consumers to offer appropriate, targeted content.And it\u2019s considerably less painful for the consumer as well. After all, if your browser knows you like Nespresso and reading about robotics, it makes sense that adverts are targeted to you around these subjects\u2013assuming you\u2019re not like 46 percent of U.S. millennials who use adblockers in the first place.However, the creepy fact is that it doesn\u2019t stop with coffee makers or the latest gadgets. Documents filed today with regulators in the UK, Poland, and Ireland, claim that despite the GDPR, our personal data is still being wrongly exploited. Even the most sensitive information about your habits is bought, sold and profiled.Behavioral advertising doesn\u2019t stop at what you read or watch at a broad level. It can track down to a list of categories agreed upon by the Interactive Advertising Bureau. And there are some scary ones on the list. Companies can sell your browsing history pertaining to categories as intimate as incest and abuse support, gay life, AIDS/HIV, incontinence, and infertility, among many others.Brave Browser Leads Privacy AdvocatesIn another slingshot against Google, Brave privacy browser claims that this sensitive information on customers is used to create profiles, otherwise known as labels. The easiest way to this is through cookies or browser tracking technology. According to the New Economics Foundation:Whole companies are built around the principle of relentlessly collecting as much data about internet users as possible, and monetising it. That should come as no surprise after shockwave after shockwave from companies like Facebook and Google in 2018. However, internet users that thought they were safe thanks to the GDPR may have to think again. Companies \u201cbroadcast profiles\u201d about UK internet users more than 160 times a day. And that info is tossed around the internet ad ecosystem blatantly ignoring consumer privacy rights.In its defense, the IAB says that these categories were developed in collaboration with academics, and admeasurement companies. The category list was meant to be a bid to make advertising more relevant for consumers and more efficient for advertisers. However, consumer profiles (or labels) stick with you for a long time.3 Privacy Focused Browsers That Can HelpA lot of internet users are quick to give their data away. Many people can\u2019t be bothered or don\u2019t have time to read the privacy policy of every site they visit. But by not doing so they are leaving a huge online footprint. Efforts such as the GDPR can only go so far. And it isn\u2019t going to keep your browsing history away from advertisers determined to get it.Even if you use an incognito window or VPN you can still be tracked. So if you want to keep your footsteps covered up online and deter the ad-tech industry from forming a profile on you consider one of the following bitcoin-friendly browsers:BraveBrave is a privacy-focused browser that gives you the option of navigating online without worrying about being watched. It also blocks all ads and trackers. Brave claims to be cryptocurrency-friendly, in that you can make micropayment donations to publishers that you like in the form of \u201ctipping.\u201d However, publishers are not given the choice as to whether they wish to receive donations, which caused some recent backlash for the privacy browser. If you bothered to read Tom's feedback, you'd understand that the token/blockchain is not the issue here. The issue is with the way in which we represent unverified creators. Tom's input is excellent, and will yield substantive changes in Brave in the very near future.\u2014 Sampson (@BraveSampson) December 22, 2018EpicThe Epic browser also comes with no ads, no spying, and no privacy abuse along with built-in VPN. Your browsing history is immediately deleted and, as they claim, is kepst safe from your ISP, employer, or even the government. Epic even accepts bitcoin for payments.Source: https://www.epicbrowser.com/TorFor advanced privacy, you can even try using Tor browser \u2013 which also accepts bitcoin (and can be used to run a full node, particularly in jurisdictions that aren\u2019t fans of Bitcoin). Tor protects your browsing history through a distributed network of nodes run by volunteers globally.If you\u2019re not ready to ditch Chrome just yet and you\u2019re happy with your adblocker, just keep in mind, turning a blind eye to these data vultures could end up costing you more than you think.Tried using alternative browsers to boost your privacy?

The move is an attempt to bypass US-imposed economic sanctions. Iran-Backed CryptocurrencyIran first announced its intentions to launch a state-backed digital currency in the summer of 2018.The move was occasioned by the fact that the country was set to undergo renewed economic sanctions from the US.Since then. the country was also kicked out of the Society for Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), which has highlighted the need for an alternative way of moving money even more.According to a new report by Al Jazeera, the country may be announcing the state-backed cryptocurrency on January 29 at the annual Electronic Banking and Payment Systems conference, which this year has a \u201cblockchain revolution\u201d theme.The cryptocurrency is expected to roll out in two different phases. The first phase will reportedly involve the issuance of a rial-backed digital token, which shall facilitate payments between local banks and other actively participating institutions.The other phase will include the launch if an instrument that will enable retail use, i.e. currency.Alternative to SWIFT?While it\u2019s currently unclear whether \u2018IranCoin\u2019 will be used to facilitate payments between Iran and other countries, it could be positioned by the Iran government as an alternative to SWIFT as Bitcoinist reported last year that Iran and Russia may use cryptocurrencies to bypass US sanctions.It also wouldn\u2019t be the first time countries are cooperating on creating a joint cryptocurrency. Recently, the UAE and Saudi Arabia announced a joint effort in this regard.However, it\u2019s questionable whether a state-backed cryptocurrency will provide regular Iranians with access to the global monetary system.Additionally, the report notes that because \u2018IranCoin\u2019 will be nothing like Bitcoin and entirely centralized, it will likely fall short of circumventing any sanctions. This is because the US will guarantee it has no place in any credible international exchange just like the rial.Speaking on the matter, blockchain and cryptocurrency developer, Yashar Rashedi explained:They certainly can\u2019t replace the likes of bitcoin due to their centralized nature, but their existence is harmless. [\u2026] Even as CBCCs may never find widespread everyday use among the general public, they may be able to offer some new features to startups and developers that had to work with centralized bank APIs before them.Do you think a state-backed cryptocurrency will help Iran combat US-imposed sanctions?

Bitcoin has now entered the all too familiar support zone between $3,000 and $3,500.Despite the recent bear market, there are some extremely clear signs that the crypto industry is thriving. Last week we highlighted bitcoin\u2019s transaction rate, which has been growing steadily over the last year.A new report out from the cryptoanalysts at Diar has been gaining traction lately. The reason we\u2019re highlighting it today is that it highlights three areas where the crypto market has drastically matured over the last year.First off, they\u2019ve identified a trend that bitcoin miners are leaving the familiar pools and now more are acting independently.Due to the high amount of computing power needed to mine bitcoin, many miners choose to pool their hashrate together and split the rewards. Through 2017 and 2018, bitcoin was largely criticized for becoming more centralized as the various pools grew stronger.We can see the current allocation of different mining pools at blockchain.info.Notice the 22% that is currently unknown, this wasn\u2019t like that at the beginning of 2017 as Diar\u2019s graph shows.Note that unknown could very well mean a higher rate of independent miners but it could also mean that some are simply not reporting which pool they belong to.The second part of the report is perhaps the most telling. Here they looked at volumes across the crypto industry and several exchanges and showed a solid year on year growth from 2017 to 2018.Last but not least, they show the market share of stablecoins diversifying nicely. Previously the industry had been dominated by Tether (USDT) but now some of the newer stable coins are dipping into Tether\u2019s market share.Diar has a nice graph but I much prefer the interactive one from stablecoinindex.com.It should be noted that USDT volumes are not actually dropping and are consistent with what they have been over the last year. Rather, the other new stable coins are simply gaining in usage. As the industry grows, it\u2019s becoming more diverse and more resilient.The main advantage of stable coins is that there is less risk of contagion between tokens. Unlike in the traditional markets, each Dollar created can be instantly traced back to its issuer. So we can always know if a Dollar comes from Circle or Gemini or somewhere else. This is vastly different from the current banking system where there is absolutely no difference between a Dollar that was created by JP Morgan and one that was created by Wells Fargo.Wishing you an amazing week ahead!eToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

Users from various jurisdictions were restricted from participation such as those from the US and the UK.According to the official release, the sale went live in two separate sessions which ran in parallel yesterday, January 28th.The price per 1 BitTorrent token (BTT) was set to $0.00012. Users could purchase BTT with Binance Coin (BNB) and Tron (TRX).The first session allowed users to purchase BTT tokens using BNB at a pegged price of 0.00001824 BNB. In other words, 1 BNB was equal to 54,824.56 BTT. This session sold out a total of 23.76 billion BTT and it was completed in 13 minutes and 25 seconds.In the second session, users were able to buy BTT with TRX (1 TRX = 223.58 BTT).

Apparently, because of the large demand, not all users saw their orders executed.This was confirmed by Changpeng Zhao, CEO at Binance, who explained the issues in a tweet.Full transparency.

Even hackers are no longer bedroom operations lead by tweens in hoodies. They are meticulously planned and carefully thought out down to the flawless laundering of funds.Chainalysis reports that two prominent professional groups (whom they label Alpha and Beta) are together responsible for at least 60 percent of all hacks from exchanges and custodial services. 60 percent. Forget about the loan computer scientist hacking his way into a system in his free time for kicks. This is organized, centralized crime.The Beta group, according to the report, is in it for personal gain. However, Alpha\u2019s goals are more disturbing beyond merely getting rich. The report omits to say what these goals are. But leaves one\u2019s imagination running wild over the sinister plans of these powerful people: financing terrorism, trafficking humans, bringing down the Bitcoin network.Covering Their TracksSince both groups are \u201cprofessional,\u201d they go to extraordinary lengths to cover their tracks and launder the money they steal. They mainly accomplish this by moving the funds around through a web of wallets and through tactics such as crypto dusting and crypto mixers. Crypto dusting is like email spam, except on the blockchain. It spams multiple wallets with a small amount of tainted cash, thereby eroding the recipients\u2019 reputation. Crypto mixing, on the other hand, changes tainted tokens for fresh ones, essentially cleaning crypto through exchanges.According to The Wall Street Journal, one hack by Alpha was followed by 15,000 transfers incredibly quickly after the money was stolen\u2013turning crypto into cash within 30 days of its theft. Beta, on the other hand, tends to HODL its stolen crypto sometimes for over a year before selling and cashing out.Source: https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-crime-hacksThe Report Could Be WrongChainalysis admits in the report that their findings may be wrong. However, as an internationally acclaimed research firm with government contracts, it still leaves bitcoin users with a stale taste in their mouth. And flags up many questions, including just how controlled the whole network is after all.If two groups are responsible for stealing over $1 billion of cryptocurrencies, could they be capable of even more sinister deeds, such as a 51% attack on the network?It\u2019s generally concluded that a 51% attack on the bitcoin network is extremely unlikely since the cost would outweigh the benefit.

This finding comes from a Bitwise Asset Management\u2019s and ETF Trend\u2019s inaugural \u201cBitwise/ETF Trends Survey of Financial Advisor Attitudes Towards Cryptoassets,\u201d which surveyed more than 150 financial advisors \u2014 including independent broker-dealer reps, financial planners, and wirehouse reps \u2014 last month.As reported in a press release, cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets are very firmly (and unsurprisingly) on the investment radar. Nearly 80 percent of all respondents claim to have received inquiries about cryptocurrencies from clients, while 22 percent plan to either enter the cryptocurrency-investment space for the first time or increase their current allocations.On the lower end of the scale, less than 10 percent of the advisors polled currently manage a crypto allocation. However, 55 percent of the advisors surveyed believe Bitcoin (BTC) will increase in value over the next half-decade \u2014 with the average price target being $17,571 on Dec 2023.The main takeaway from the report is that interest in cryptocurrency investing from financial advisors has thrived, despite a brutal bear market which has undoubtedly shaken out many retail investors. Bitwise Asset Management\u2019s Global Head of Research, Matt Hougan, stated:After a year in which the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index fell 78%, the survey shows that interest in crypto investing from financial advisors not only survived, but grew. There are clear reasons why: Advisors tell us that they are getting inbound questions from clients, that they need ways to connect with a younger generation of clients, and that clients are investing in crypto outside of their advisory relationship anyway.Tom Lydon, ETF Trends\u2019 Founder and Editor, likewise explained:Financial advisors, and particularly ETF-focused financial advisors, are always on the cutting-edge of new developments. The survey results suggest that increasingly means having good answers and insights when it comes to crypto.What do you think about the results from Bitwise Asset Management\u2019s and ETF Trend\u2019s inaugural \u201cBitwise/ETF Trends Survey of Financial Advisor Attitudes Towards Cryptoassets?\u201d What do you think the price of Bitcoin will be in 2023?

Today it\u2019s estimated that more than 170 million people are actively using BitTorrent and yesterday they launched their very own crypto token.The ICO distributed almost 60 billion tokens, worth a total of roughly $7.2 million, in the blink of an eye.

Indeed, the enthusiasm on social media and the ensuing frenzy when the site was overrun with traffic was strongly reminiscent of the exuberance that gripped the crypto market in 2017.Perhaps this is a sign of good things to come of a market that is willing to take calculated risks on projects that people believe in yet at the same time quick to reject projects that don\u2019t add value.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsDays to next Shutdown: 17 | Days to Brexit: 59Earnings Season ContinuesUSDT Takes 4th PlacePlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of January 29th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsA series of votes in the UK Parliament today could very well give us some fresh insight into how Brexit will play out.Things are getting pretty confusing now and rather than taking three long paragraphs of your time, I\u2019ll simply refer you to this video where the BBC gives a surprisingly comprehensive overview of the current situation.In any case, we can watch the drama and the market\u2019s reaction this evening. There\u2019s an increasing feeling that sterling traders have become complacent to Brexit risks, especially now that the government seems to be making contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit.The GBPUSD is now trading above its 200-day moving average (blue) and near the top of the range that it\u2019s been building for the past six months (yellow lines).Earnings DramaThings didn\u2019t go so well for Nvidia or Caterpillar. Both companies reported earnings below analysts expectations and both have blamed the economic slowdown in China for their shortcomings.The two companies opened the day with a sizable gap downward, which ended up putting a damper on the US session.Today we\u2019ll see another three dozen or so companies reporting their earnings. The big one, of course, will be Apple who is reporting after the market closes tonight. Tim Cook has already prepared the market in advance for a disappointing figure and no doubt many analysts have already lowered their expectations. Who knows, maybe they\u2019ll even surprise for the good.The United States will also be reporting their consumer confidence figures shortly after the opening bell, which may shake things up as well.Stablecoin in 4th Place!?The crypto space was shocked yesterday afternoon to see the stablecoin known as Tether (USDT) take 4th place in the market cap rankings.As we\u2019ve mentioned many times before, the market cap metric is not a great way to measure the value of cryptoassets but seeing USDT rising up the ranks so quickly can be a very telling sign of investor sentiment.Generally speaking, if traders are fearful of volatility in the crypto market and want to reduce exposure, the default option at many exchanges is to hold the money in USDT.To be clear, this is neither a bullish nor a bearish signal, it just means that traders are taking their foot off the gas for a bit. In this graph from tradingview.com, we can see that short positions on bitcoin (blue line) have come down pretty drastically over the last two months whereas long positions (red line) haven\u2019t increased by much.Indeed, Tether\u2019s market cap has grown during this time frame but if we zoom out even just a little bit we can see that USDT market cap has been higher than it is now.A neutral position could very well be a sign of good things to come as it might just signal that the bears are finally letting up.Let\u2019s have a fantastic day ahead!This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

The Korean Won, the Euro, and the British pound round off the top five Bitcoin fiat trading pairs in terms of volume. Though these are dwarfed by JPY and USD, comprising less than 2 percent of the total volume each.JPY/BTC has grown in popularity substantially over the last two months of 2018. In November, it accounted for only 21 percent of the BTC trading, compared to a solid 50 percent for the USD. But whether it will remain in at the top remains to be seen as Bitcoin price struggles to hold above $3,000.What Changed?In December, Bitcoinist reported on a study which claimed that Asia has more impact on Bitcoin price than America and Europe. The study cited major developments from Asia concerning cryptocurrencies, which had impacted the market by an average of 18.61 percent.Thing are indeed moving fast in the East. Just a couple of weeks ago, one of Japan\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Coincheck, was registered with the Financial Services Agency.Additionally, a new partnership was formed between Blockstream, Digital Garage, and Tokyo Tanshi, which will serve the Japanese Bitcoin market by launching a JPY-pegged stablecoin.Furthermore, in October last year, the country gave formal approval for the cryptocurrency industry to regulate itself, substantially increasing the capabilities of the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), which is now authorized to punish operators which fail to conform to the stringent safety regulations put by the local authorities.What do you think about the Japanese Yen overtaking the Dollar in Bitcoin trading?

Sure, bitcoin taxes can be complicated, but research suggests that 61% of holders don\u2019t realize they can write off last years losses as a tax deduction.Bitcoin? What Bitcoin?3 years of solid (53 percent in 2015) to phenomenal (1245 percent in 2017) growth, have seen bitcoin gains conveniently overlooked on many tax returns. But with bitcoin losing over 70 percent of its value last year, many investors will have sold at a loss.This may prompt a surge in cryptocurrency tax declarations filed for 2018, according to Gidi Bar Zakay, CEO and founder of Bittax. However, according to a survey carried out in November 2018 by credit-score provider Credit Karma, it may not.They found that US investors who \u2018cashed-out\u2019 their bitcoin in 2018, collectively lost $1.7 billion, or an average of $718 per person who cashed out. However, results also showed that only a third (35 percent) of investors who sold at a loss plan to report.In fact, before taking the survey, 61 percent of Bitcoin investors who lost money, didn\u2019t realize they could claim a tax deduction.Bitcoin Taxes: 53% Don\u2019t Intend to ReportBut these people could be missing out, as capital losses can be used to offset capital gains, or even claim a tax refund. After learning of the rules, over half of investors (with either gains or losses) said they would be more likely to report.In fairness, 53 percent of investors surveyed said they did intend to report gains or losses, with 19 percent undecided. Strangely, more investors who gained were likely to report (59 percent) than those who lost money (38 percent). Or at least, that\u2019s how they answered the survey.Reasons for not reporting included thinking losses/gains were not significant enough (57percent), and falsely believing it isn\u2019t required (35 percent). 22 percent of respondents claimed they did not know how to report gains or losses.The basic trick is to subtract the price you bought the bitcoin at from the price you sold it, leaving the profit or loss. But this might not be as easy as it sounds, according to the CEO of Libra, promoting his crypto-tax calculator. This is because cryptocurrency brokers don\u2019t have to provide customers with the same form that stockbrokers do.Still, if you\u2019re sitting on a substantial loss, and want to claim tax relief on that, it may be worth hiring an accountant.Will you be filing your Bitcoin taxes this year?

For the long term, I wish to control my risk score below 4, and maintain more than a 20% yearly profit. I personally prefer long-term stable strategy.Do you have any advice for your copiers/users considering copying you?I hope everyone can have a stable investment period. I have calculated the data of who follows and who stops following me, and some of them only copy me for a short time, for one or two days.

According to Gemini, \u201cthis is paramount to our mission to build the future of money.\u201dTo improve its security controls, in 2018, Gemini hired Deloitte & Touche LLP, one of the Big Four auditors, to perform a SOC-2 Type 1 examination.SOC-2 is based on Trust Service Criteria, which focuses on non-financial reporting controls. Specifically, SOC-2 reviews the effectiveness of controls implemented for minimizing risks on security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of a system. On the other hand, SOC 1 deals with the effectiveness of financial reporting controls.Gemini states that the areas emphasized by the SOC-2 examination were: Gemini Exchange\u2019s application, infrastructure, and underlying customer database, and Gemini\u2019s institutional-grade storage system that stores the private keys of online and offline wallets.As a result, on January 29, 2019, upon completion of the review, Gemini announced,This makes Gemini the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency exchange and custodian to demonstrate this level of security compliance in protecting customer data and funds.\u201cGemini\u2019s product is TRUST,\u201d Cameron Winklevoss added. \u201cWe have just added another layer of trust by becoming the world\u2019s FIRST crypto EXCHANGE and CUSTODIAN to complete a SOC 2 Review by Deloitte.\u201dWinklevii Remain Committed to Bitcoin ETFThe Winklevoss twins started Gemini in 2014 in New York, where the company is licensed as a trust, subject to fiduciary and capital reserve standards.

The demo was made as part of a wider presentation on cryptocurrency by the group at the Congressional Blockchain Caucus.\u201cWe were able to show the process of sending tiny amounts of bitcoin from our phones to the vending machine and watch it dispense candy in real time. The network fees were 1 satoshi per transaction,\u201d Coin Center wrote in a follow-up blog post.What do you think about the Lightning Network\u2019s capacity increase?

Many are looking to this as a critical technical level which is yet to be interrogated.The key monthly technical levels below this are $1,800 and $1,400, but $2450 and $2,800 are also areas of interest.By definition, as Bitcoin price retreats back through its parabolic advance, additional levels of support will be identified and will become more difficult to breakthrough for a sustained period of time.Daily ChartThe daily chart paints a more relieving picture for the bulls in the short term, with Bitcoin\u2019s current decline showing signs of conclusion within a quasi-falling wedge advancing towards the 200-week moving average price around $3,300.This would imply that a short term recovery towards $3700 may be possible, but there remains the issue of the declining diagonal resistance overhead.Market SentimentAs previously reported, the bulls are still leveraged over and above that of the Bears at a ratio of 1.13:1.Although speculative selling pressure is starting to creep at these prices, history would suggest that more is to come and the low $3000s will need to be revisited once more with conviction before a definitive bottom can be found.Trade Bitcoin, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

But new research from the World Gold Council says otherwise. Gold kicks Bitcoin\u2019s sorry ass.World Gold Council ReportIn a report published on Tuesday, the World Gold Council touches upon the erratic performance of all major markets in 2018, including gold. However, it pays particular attention to quarter four, noting that gold price, unlike almost all other markets, rebounded.Investors typically flock to gold during times of stock market uncertainty. And Q4 2018 was, according to the report, the worst quarter on record since 2009. However, while Bitcoin 00 had its opportunity to demonstrate its safe haven asset qualities during stock market volatility, unlike gold, it failed to do so and continued to display itself as a risky asset.During Q4 2018, while stock markets experienced their worst quarter since 2009, cryptocurrencies had the opportunity to demonstrate qualities associated with safe-havens like gold. But cryptocurrencies behaved like risky assets & fell while gold rallied. https://t.co/gvVa8ke1sc pic.twitter.com/vkc9MHczv8\u2014 World Gold Council (@GOLDCOUNCIL) January 29, 2019Director of Investment Research Juan Carlos Artigas commented:2018 was a rollercoaster year for financial markets and gold was no exception. Higher interest rates, a strong dollar, and rising stock prices created significant headwinds for gold for most of 2018. However, Q4 saw a rally as geopolitical and macroeconomic risks escalated and global stock markets stumbled, the gold price rebounded\u2026 In fact, gold outperformed almost all global financial assets.Source: World Gold Council Cryptocurrencies Are Not a Safe HavenHop on over to their website and the World Gold Council states loud and clear that cryptocurrencies are not a safe haven and that while comparisons have been made:There are several reasons why cryptocurrencies are no substitute for gold.These are mainly due to Bitcoin\u2019s high volatility and the fact that gold has a more established and liquid market. Moreover, they claim that unlike Bitcoin, gold has a \u201cwell-understood role in an investment portfolio.\u201dWhile the Winklevoss twins insist that Bitcoin will pass gold\u2019s $7 trillion market cap, currently World Gold Council research doesn\u2019t support their claim. In fact, Bitcoin resembled more of a technology stock in 2018, falling by as much as 55% during Q4, while gold rebounded by 9.4%.The report fails to mention, however, that even at $4k in November 2018, Bitcoin still historically outperformed Amazon stock. Gold may indeed be a stable option, but it hasn\u2019t posted nearly the same gains as the S&P and FAANG stocks like AMZN in the past decade.Therefore, if you\u2019re looking for stability then gold would probably be a better bet than stocks and especially a new asset class like bitcoin.Source: World Gold CouncilMoreover, Bitcoin and Nasdaq were \u201cheavily correlated\u201d at 0.69, while gold was \u201cstrongly inversely correlated\u201d at -0.73.This leads the report to conclude that in times of market stress, cryptocurrencies have demonstrated that they are not a safe haven asset.Unlike last year\u2019s report where the Council acknowledged Bitcoin\u2019s superior 13-fold increase compared to gold\u2019s 13% gains and even stated that Bitcoin could undermine central banks, this year the kudos is downplayed.Analysts do concede that Bitcoin has a role to play in an investment portfolio\u2013but (unsurprisingly) not as a viable substitute for gold.

Proof-of-Concept Blockchain IntegrationThe Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is a global banking payments network. It works with over 11,000 institutions and moves an estimated $200 billion every day.Today, speaking at the Paris Fintech Forum, the company\u2019s CEO, Gottfried Leibbrandt, revealed that they are working on a proof-of-concept for integrating R3\u2019s blockchain-based trade finance platform with SWIFT\u2019s Global Payments Innovation (GPI) framework. Leibbrandt said:We are announcing later today a proof-of-concept with the R3 blockchain on trade where you can initiate a payment on the trade platform and then it goes into GPI. We\u2019re exploring interconnectivity with a lot of things and banks have always been a part of that interconnectivity.The GPI initiative was introduced by SWIFT back in 2017 and it\u2019s intended to speed up payment-processing times, lower the costs and increase transparency. However, it relies predominantly on currently existing infrastructure and as such, it can be rather slow and expensive.Shots FiredLeibbrandt was speaking on stage right next to Ripple\u2019s CEO Brad Garlinghouse. The latter has previously criticized SWIFT for its high published error rate, saying:SWIFT\u2019s published error rate is six percent. Imagine if six percent of your emails didn\u2019t go through without additional human intervention.Garlinghouse didn\u2019t miss the chance to highlight the benefits of decentralization, while also outlining some of SWIFT\u2019s weak points:Swift today is a one-way messaging framework, it isn\u2019t a liquidity provider. When we think about an internet of value, it\u2019s a mixture of two-way messaging frameworks \u2014 moving to a real-time chatting protocol if you will \u2014 coupled with real-time liquidity.On the other hand, Leibbrandt said that his company\u2019s historic reluctance about blockchain has been fueled additionally by volatile swings and sharp declines in the price of cryptocurrency.He also outlined that a large part of Ripple\u2019s value proposition is XRP \u2013 the cryptocurrency and that banks are reluctant to convert because of the volatility.While none of them hinted at a potential near-term partnership, Garlinghouse said that they are open to \u201cways we could work with SWIFT.\u201dIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that last year R3 launched an application aimed to enhance global cryptocurrency payments, Corda Settler, the first settlement mechanism that it decided to use was XRP.And while R3 and Ripple are technically competitors, following SWIFT\u2019s announcement the price of XRP 00 marks 8.8% increase at the time of this writing.What do you think of SWIFT\u2019s announcement?

Earnings Season Kicks Off Bitcoinist | Jan 31, 2019 | 00:00 Share Tweet Send Share Each quarter, publicly listed companies share their earnings reports with their investors and the general public. These reports provide insights into each company\u2019s performance and more often than not, impact their stock prices. Over the next six weeks, companies will be sharing their reports for the fourth quarter of 2018 (Q4), with major banks kicking off the earnings season. Reporting earnings in a challenging marketThis earnings season has a very meaningful backdrop, as Wall Street has been heavily impacted by external forces recently. Firstly, the Fed\u2019s drive to hike rates over the past year, with four rate hikes in 2018, has put pressure on the market.Perhaps the most important factor causing Wall Street to struggle recently has been the rising yield of 10-year bonds. These bonds, issued by the US Treasury, present a relatively low-risk investment option and produce steady returns twice a year. When the interest produced by these bonds is high, it could push investors away from the stock market, as the safer option is now also high yielding. Recently, 10-year bond yields have been giving investors interest rates of 2.73%.Entering this earnings season, many companies face the challenge of remaining a lucrative investment option for their shareholders. For some companies in the financial sector, this season might be especially crucial, as they have to recover from less-than-impressive results last quarter.Banking on earningsThe last time around, several large financial institutions disappointed their investors by displaying subpar performance. Wells Fargo is one of the companies that is hoping for a turnaround. The financial powerhouse has been in a slump over the past several quarters, still trying to recover from a scandal of two years ago, in which it was revealed that its employees created fake accounts for clients, in order to meet sales targets. Last July, the company experienced a 1.3 % increase in its stock price, following the Q3 earnings report that exceeded expectationsIndicative prices for illustration purposesAnother financial institution that is looking to make a comeback is Citigroup, which experienced a 2.5% increase in stock price following its Q3 earnings report. However, the financial sector was not all negative last quarter. Morgan Stanley was able to beat market expectations and its share price spiked 5% following better-than-expected results. These financial institutions, alongside other major players, such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, have a lot to prove this quarter.Investing in the financial sector on eToroTheBigBanks CopyPortfolio is one of eToro\u2019s first Market CopyPortfolios, offering investors a thematic investment opportunity in a fully allocated portfolio comprised of leading banks and financial institutions.

By the second and third time it was sent to me I\u2019d already dismissed it completely. After all, why would I want to delve through pages of FUD from one of bitcoin\u2019s harshest critics? At least as far as the report\u2019s summary, it seemed like fairly standard stuff. Roadblocks to adoption, the recent bear market, scalability issues, so figured I may as well skip it. That is until I saw this post stating they\u2019d made a calculation error.To sum it up, ZeroHedge is claiming that JP Morgan had made a classic newbie error when calculating bitcoin\u2019s mining costs. Unlike physical commodities bitcoin has a steady rate of production, which is 12.5 BTC approximately every 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners there are.Upon further inspection however, it seems that JPM\u2019s assessment made no such claims. What they did actually made sense. By breaking the miners into different categories, they make the claim that it is the low-cost miners who set the price floor.Mining costs are notoriously difficult to estimate but assuming for argument\u2019s sake these numbers are correct, bitcoin is now below the average mining cost ($4,060).What the report does indicate is that if the high-cost miners choose to exit, then the low-cost miners will then be competing against each other, which could drive the prices down as far as $1,260. Again, an accurate statement.What JP Morgan fails to take into account is a simple matter of behavioral economics. By their own admission, and included in the graph above, a large number of miners have been operating at a loss for a while now, and hashrates continue to increase even in countries where electricity is more expensive.Therefore, there isn\u2019t much reason to assume that if someone in the Czech Republic, for example, has been mining bitcoin for $8,000 until now, he\u2019ll suddenly abandon his rig if the price drops another $1,000 or $2,000. Certainly, some will be forced out as nobody can operate at a loss indefinitely, but whoever can afford to will likely hang on for as long as they can.Good to see JP Morgan doing their homework but it seems they still don\u2019t quite understand what HODL means.@MatiGreenspaneToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsDays to next Shutdown: 16 | Days to Brexit: 58Shhh\u2026 the Fed is talkingCrypto Road HumpsPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of January 30th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsIt\u2019s the oldest trick on Wall Street. Traders seem to care less about profit growth and more about the expectations. So by lowering expectations, companies can actually turn bad news into good.As we discussed in yesterday\u2019s update, Apple did a fairly good job of preparing analysts for a sour report. So when they did announce some pretty dismal numbers it was not really a surprise that they beat analysts expectations.That didn\u2019t stop shares from exploding in after-hours trading when the headlines read\u2026Stranger still, it was only the headline \u201cearnings per share\u201d figure that beat expectations. Other metrics like revenue and Q1 iPhone revenue still managed to fall short.The fun continues this evening with Facebook, Microsoft, and Tesla reporting after the closing bell tonight.Fed DayBefore that though, we\u2019ll get a very special press conference with the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell. Interest rates are not expected to change today but as the Fed is currently the largest player in the financial markets, investors will want to hear what Jay has to say.Indeed, Fed watchers have recently become increasingly confused by the central bank\u2019s actions. Throughout 2018 there has been a lot of volatility in the markets, largely due to the expectations that the Fed will continue to raise rates and wind down their balance sheet.In reaction to that volatility, and possibly rhetoric from the President, Powell has assured us that they\u2019ll be less likely to continue the hiking process going forward. However, the issue of the balance sheet continues to remain elusive.Crypto Road BlocksAs was mentioned in the JP report above, which admittedly I still haven\u2019t gone through entirely, crypto still has a lot of roadblocks to acheive widespread adoption. I certainly agree with their assessment that we\u2019re very much in the early days of the blockchain revolution and it could certainly take time before the full benefits are realized.However, as investors, we still need to take into account that all crypto assets are risky. The simple fact is that we\u2019re dealing with very experimental technology and so things can certainly go wrong along the way. This is why it always pays to diversify your investment portfolio and trade in other assets as well.One example of the way the tech could go wrong was experienced yesterday in the NEO network.Now, without getting too technical it seems that some people running the NEO blockchain weren\u2019t updating properly, possibly due to poor connections, and the entire network was out of sync. Some prefer not to use the term \u201cfork\u201d to describe this, and simply calling it a \u201cspork.\u201dIn any case, it seems that everything has been resolved by now and the impact on the price was minimal.As well, Ethereum might run into a bit of difficulty due to the delay of the Constantinople upgrade. It seems that the \u201cdifficulty bomb\u201d that the upgrade was supposed to offset has now kicked in and the block reward has dropped by 25%.On the one hand, less supply coming online could increase the price of Ethereum but it seems the hashrate is dropping at the moment.Not to worry though, Vitalik is currently sitting with some of the top devs at Stanford University campus working on the issue. Session recordings are here.Despite the above, it seems crypto prices are rising this morning on the news that\u2026Though I\u2019m hesitant to take this time frame as fact, it seems that alternative investors who have been waiting for large scale bitcoin adoption from large institutional players have something to chew on this morning and that seems to be enough to put some green on the board today.Many thanks for taking the time to read the daily market updates.

According to data from Coin.Dance, however, its volumes have been decreasing ever since reflecting the BTC price decrease over the period.Build It But Will They Come?Most recently, Binance revealed its \u2018pre-alpha\u2019 demo version of its decentralized exchange dubbed Binance Chain, while also making it clear that it will support hardware wallets from the beginning.Industry proponents such as John McAfee have gone so far as to say that decentralized exchanges will trigger the \u201clargest economic boom in history.\u201dMeanwhile, in late 2018, the SEC filed charges in the first case involving a decentralized Ethereum-based exchange EtherDelta.Commenting on the matter was Robert Cohen, Chief of the SEC Division of Enforcement Cyber Unit, who said:The focus is on the function, and what the platform is doing. Whether it\u2019s decentralized or not, whether it\u2019s on a smart contract or not, what matters is it\u2019s an exchange.In any case, it appears that at the current time, users are just not drawn to the idea of trading cryptocurrencies on a decentralized exchange.

Not your vault, not your gold. https://t.co/ThSkkuXGqO\u2014 Jesse Powell (@jespow) January 25, 2019Furthermore, a UK foreign office minister has suggested that the central bank grant access to Venezuela\u2019s gold reserves to Guaid\u00f3 rather than Maduro.Worth noting, February 2018 saw the latter announce a second state-sponsored \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 to the supposedly oil-backed Petro called \u2018Petro Gold\u2019 backed by the yellow metal.This plan appears to have gone up in smoke. Particularly as the reserves sit across the ocean in a foreign vault. Thus, the concept of \u2018backing\u2019 a digital currency with a physical asset appears to exist in name only if a nation is unable to physically secure its own reserves.In retrospect, Bitcoin would have been a much better option for Maduro in regards to security and transport costs. Yes, Bitcoin is considered by many \u2018digital gold,\u2019 but more importantly, it is politically neutral and the funds could have been secured with a simple passphrase rather than trusting a foreign bank.\u201cVenezuela (Iran, Russia) Have A Great Opportunity To Fight American USD Imperialism By Legalizing Bitcoin,\u201d notes Keiser.Other nations should take note as Maduro is now scrambling to move its remaining reserves via plane to a destination unknown to avoid further confiscation.Bitcoin Adoption Surging in VenezuelaAs Bitcoinist continues to report, Venezuela has embraced Bitcoin in increasing swathes to overcome the extreme volatility in its national currency, the Sovereign Bolivar (VES).Last week, residents traded more VES for Bitcoin than at any other time since records began, with trade volumes on decentralized P2P trading platform Localbitcoins topping 1780 BTC ($6.12 million). The government appears uninterested in targeting such capital outflows despite their increasing size, with more consumer infrastructure for Bitcoin rumored to be on the way.Earlier in January, Panama-based Cryptobuyer announced it would open Caracas\u2019 first Bitcoin ATM in the coming weeks.Should nations consider holding bitcoin just like gold to avoid asset confiscation?

Despite the savage bear market conditions and freefalling prices, cryptocurrency theft is on the rise.Hackers Take the Lion\u2019s ShareOf the total stolen cryptocurrency funds, hackers made away with the lion\u2019s share. Some $950 million was taken from exchanges and wallet providers. The below chart says it all. Despite Bitcoin losing 80 percent in value, there were 3.6x more hacks on exchanges than in 2017.Source: CipherTrace ReportWhy is this? Many exchanges have been in operation for less than two years and fail to have adequate safeguards in place to prevent hacks. At the same time, the methods that cybercriminals are using are becoming more sophisticated. In fact, according to Chainalysys, over 60 percent of all exchange hacks were carried out by just two professional groups.Moreover, earlier this month Bitcoinist reported that many of the top 100 exchanges including Bithumb, Coincheck, and Zaif had lax cybersecurity protocols in place. This includes insufficient user security, server security, and no ongoing procedures to improve security, such as bug bounty programs.Not all the stolen cryptocurrencies came from exchanges, however. At least $725 million was due to \u201cinside jobs.\u201d These include fraudulent ICOs, exit scams, staged exchange hacks, and Ponzi schemes.Dave Jevans, CEO of CipherTrace and co-chair of the Cryptocurrency Working Group at the APWG.org commented:Cryptocurrency criminal activity continues to evolve and accelerate. Fortunately, pending global legislation will hamstring many criminals, global gangs, and terrorist groups by greatly reducing their opportunities to launder.AML/CFT Regulations Coming Out in 2019Financial Action Task Force (FATF) regulations on AML/CFT (counter financing terrorism) will come into effect in quarter three of 2019. These international standards will make it much harder for criminals to launder cryptocurrency, meaning they will have to resort to more sophisticated tactics. Jevans stated:These tough new laws will drive bad actors to not only innovate but also flock to jurisdictions with weak regulatory oversight.This is because the FATF regulations apply to 38 member countries, including the EU, US, and G20. So all exchanges, wallet providers and custodian services must implement proper KYC checks or risk hefty fines and closures.G20 Leaders committed to \"regulate #crypto-assets for anti-#moneylaundering and countering the financing of terrorism in line with FATF standards\". \u27a1\ufe0f FATF Report to the #G20 Leaders' Summit https://t.co/ZZECBoAZSc pic.twitter.com/njbTxzH8TL\u2014 FATF (@FATFNews) December 3, 2018According to Jevans, cybercriminals will try to get around the tough AML laws by resorting to techniques such as \u201ccrypto dusting.\u201d This is where thousands of people receive a tiny amount of tainted cryptocurrency, serving to undermine their reputations and confusing security tools. Like emailing spamming, except by using dirty coins.However, Jevans told Bitcoinist that he was confident the cryptocurrency industry would soon have the situation under control.As regards cybercrime, In 2003-2010 we saw huge financial losses for online banking and investing customers due to phishing attacks and malware. But the banks got that under control, as did the regulators. And today everyone uses online banking and online investing. The crypto industry is undergoing the same phase now.The FATF has a pretty large challenge ahead if it\u2019s to prevent organized crime from laundering the dirty funds they steal. But hopefully, CipherTrace\u2019s statistics will look a lot different this time next year (and the price of bitcoin as well).Will cryptocurrency theft increase in 2019? Share your prediction below!

The stock exchange operator says that it has already on-boarded seven platforms.Rigorous Vetting Needed for Bitcoin ExchangesNasdaq has a team of 20 people conducting due-diligence checks on Bitcoin exchanges that want to start using the company\u2019s trading surveillance technology, reports Forbes.This team tries to examine if each applicant has the technical capacity to employ the tools as well as a commitment to best practices.The process covers the examination of three main areas; business model, KYC/AML protocols, and exchange governance/controls, explains, Tony Sio, Exchange and Regulator Surveillance chief. He adds:Historically, we don\u2019t do such a large vetting process for our clients because they are much more well-known. But as we started working with less well-known names, startups, then we realized we needed to do this check process.Combating Bitcoin Wash TradingSBI Virtual Currency and Gemini, along with five other unnamed platforms have already scaled through the vetting process.Back in July 2018, Bitcoinist reported that Nasdaq was already working SBI, Gemini and three other unnamed exchanges, meaning the stock exchange giant has added two new client platforms.In November 2018, the company declared that it could lead the fight to combat market manipulation through the use of its trading surveillance technology.Market manipulation is indeed a concern and is often cited as one of the biggest reasons the Bitcoin ETF has not yet been approved. A 2018 report by the Blockchain Transparency Institute (BTI) alleged that more than 70 percent of the top 100 exchanges listed on CoinMarketCap were engaging in wash trading.Nasdaq\u2019s Crypto and Blockchain Technology AspirationsNasdaq\u2019s crypto aspirations also extend beyond policing the trading space. According to reports confirmed by VanEck at the back-end of 2018, Nasdaq plans to launch Bitcoin futures trading before the end of Q1 2019.The company is also delving into the spot trading arena, joining Fidelity Investments to raise $27.5 million for a new Bitcoin exchange back in December 2018. Adena Friedman, the Nasdaq CEO, stated several times that the company would consider creating its crypto exchange platform once more clear-cut regulations emerged.While the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, Nasdaq seems intent to capture the cryptocurrency trading surveillance market. Elaborating on the company\u2019s approach, Sio said:The objective that we\u2019re trying to work with crypto is we see this as a growing asset class. So we\u2019re working to help provide our technology, it could be around matching, it could be around surveillance, to help our customers as they grow their marketplaces.On the blockchain front, the company participated in funding rounds for startups like Symbiont and Linq.Will Nasdaq\u2019s efforts yield significant results in a trading arena as fragmented as cryptocurrency currently is?

Such is the headache for some businesses looking to serve the US market, exchanges including Bittrex and Coinbase have opted to segregate their domestic and non-domestic audiences by setting up entirely separate platforms.

At the beginning of November, the distributed computing platform\u2019s token was hovering around the $200 dollar mark. Then, over the span of just a few weeks, it lost more than half of its value. The state of ETH prices is even more staggering given last year\u2019s bull run. In January of last year, the token surpassed the $1400 dollar mark. A worrisome situation for Ethereum investorsOne of the main reasons for ETH\u2019s price decline is confusion and uncertainty among investors. Traders that made their first cryptocurrency purchases last year when prices were high seem to have lost faith in the entire industry.Controversy around last November\u2019s Bitcoin Cash hard fork may have contributed to first time investors\u2019 doubt. After the fork, Forbes contributor Peter Tchir concluded that \u201ccryptocurrencies in general have lost their luster.\u201dCompanies that raised millions of dollars through their ICOs last year are now selling Ether and other cryptocurrency assets that they had received to avoid further losses. According to cryptocurrency research group Diar, blockchain companies sold 222,615 ETH in November.Rampant speculation has hurt the industryDu Capital founder, blockchain expert and experienced ICO investor Peter Du believes that the unrealistic expectations around new blockchain technologies is one of the main reasons why crypto markets are in the state they are in today.\u201cTo be sure, maintaining hundreds of billions of dollars in valuations supported by unsecured coin issuance was unrealistic and in the long-term, unsustainable,\u201d Du said.Du went on to state that once the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued stricter regulations on ICOs, reality set in and skyrocketing Ether prices came back down to Earth. Performance bottlenecks, he thinks, created by Ethereum\u2019s insufficient underlying infrastructure may have also played a part in the asset\u2019s price decline.Balanced regulation neededIn all fairness, some criticism is justified. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton is one of the proponents of less regulation. At a cryptocurrency industry conference last October, Clinton said that regulators were \u201ckilling the goose that laid the golden egg.\u201d He went on to say that \u201cyou can\u2019t apply [an] old regulatory regime to a new technology.\u201dPerhaps the most heavily criticized piece of cryptocurrency legislation in the US is New York\u2019s BitLicense. Critics of BitLicense say that it\u2019s vaguely worded and places too great of a financial burden on blockchain startups.When BitLicense was first proposed, MIT researchers said that it had \u201ccritical flaws.\u201d Jesse Powell of Kraken said that BitLicense would \u201cstifle innovation\u201d and make it impossible to run a profitable crypto exchange in the state. After New York passed the bill that created BitLicense, Kraken and several other cryptocurrency exchanges pulled out of New York. Perianne Boring of the Chamber of Digital Commerce called BitLicense \u201cworrisome\u201d and said that other states might use BitLicense as a template.Boring\u2019s prediction was confirmed when a bill that would create similar regulation before California legislatures. Coinfirm CEO Pawel Kuskowski commented that the cryptocurrency bill would have an \u201ceven more catastrophic effect\u201d than BitLicense. The proposed bill was amended and then died but concerns about the direction of cryptocurrency legislation in California remain. Lack of clear policy has created an uncertain regulatory environment in one of America\u2019s most populous states.Other technology embracing states, such as Connecticut and Washington, have also imposed blockchain regulations perceived as cumbersome by enthusiasts. However, Du as a contrarian, thinks that this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing and real value must be created in order to achieve what it set out to do. \u201cEthereum as an infrastructure blockchain that other coins hinged on, was a beneficiary, and grew in valuation as a result, but without having the equivalent growth in infrastructure, ecosystem and mass adoptable applications.\u201d In the end, Ethereum\u2019s success will mean the industry\u2019s success, he thinks. What\u2019s next for blockchain?Despite the problems that blockchain companies are dealing with today, Du is upbeat about the industry\u2019s future.\u201cNot all is gloom and if anything, we must learn from this. At the end of the day, discerning investors should care less about short-term speculation and more about solidifying building blocks in the long-term to make blockchain a formidable and reliable ecosystem.\u201dAuthorities in the US and elsewhere can also contribute by creating smart regulatory frameworks that benefit and protect consumers while also providing stability for blockchain businesses. Most cryptocurrency business leaders agree that the unclear and unfair rules that are currently in place are preventing the cryptocurrency industry from realizing its full potential.Images courtesy of Shutterstock, Pixabay.[Editor\u2019s Note: This is a guest article authored by Alex Munkachy.]The Rundown A worrisome situation for Ethereum investorsRampant speculation has hurt the industryBalanced regulation neededWhat\u2019s next for blockchain?"}

As the largest players in the market, everything they say or do can have a resounding impact on prices. When central banks have a loose monetary policy, as they have over the last decade, markets tend to rise. When they start to tighten policy, as they did in 2018, volatility usually sets in.At a highly anticipated meeting yesterday the US Federal Reserve Bank gave the markets exactly what they wanted but not necessarily what they needed.Not only did they confirm that they\u2019ll be taking it slow with interest rates going forward but they also indicated that they\u2019re willing to slow down the pace at which they\u2019re winding down their massive balance sheet.What does this mean?A year ago, it seemed as if the economy was finally strong enough to stand on its own without the help of the central banks. Today, it seems that the United States, Europe, China, and of course Japan may need to continue providing financial support to the markets for some time to come.Upon the hearing the news that they\u2019re not strong enough to survive on their own, the markets are flying today!@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsDays to next Shutdown: 15 | Days to Brexit: 57Facebook Crushes EarningsXRP Pops the Crypto MarketPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of January 31st. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsAs the clock continues to wind down on Brexit, it seems the EU says they\u2019re not willing to renegotiate. Somehow, it seems that the odds of a time extension on the March 29th deadline, a no deal Brexit, and no Brexit at all are all increasing simultaneously.According to a report this morning from UBS, it seems that large financial institutions are taking a risk-averse approach and are hedging their positions in case Brexit goes pear-shaped.On the chart, we can see a pretty clear and familiar range for the GBPUSD from 1.25 to 1.3250.Earnings ContinueAnother 40 or so companies will report their quarterly earnings today. For dessert, Amazon will report after the closing bell.If some companies are able to get away blaming their poor profits on China, Amazon cannot. So this should give us a pretty good picture of how the market is looking. As did Facebook, by the way, who despite all the #deleteFacebook drama managed to deliver an outstanding report.Not only did they show that advertising dollars continue to roll in, but they managed to surpass expectations in just about every category and region. The stock is up approximately 12% in after-hours trading.XRP Pops CryptoIn a single hour of trading yesterday, XRP managed to erase an entire week\u2019s worth of losses. The pop of roughly 10% in Ripple\u2019s token seems to have buoyed the entire crypto market and sentiment is once again optimistic\u2026 for now.Here we can see how the action played out. XRP (in green) started its massive surge about 5 minutes before the rest of the market. Also, notice the build-up to the surge (yellow circle) that happened independently of the rest of the market.At the Paris Fintech Forum yesterday, what was supposed to be a hot debate between Ripple and SWIFT may have turned into something more.While onstage with Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of SWIFT Gottfried Leibbrandt announced a brand new partnership with payments provider R3.You can watch the beginning of the \u201cdebate\u201d at this link but what I want you to notice is that the two men seemed to spend more time agreeing with each other than debating.Where things get really exciting is that R3 has very recently entered into a partnership with Ripple Labs. This entire story instantly brings to mind the news we covered in a market update last month (Titled: Goodbye to the Year of Uncertainty) where Visa made a monumental purchase of a payments company called Earthport, a long term partner of Ripple Labs.So it seems, what we\u2019ve been referring to as a \u201cbattle\u201d in the payments space may actually be more of a giant network under construction, which includes all the major players in the industry and implements cutting edge technology, with Ripple increasingly growing as part of this network.On the stage, Garlinghouse very suddenly and unexpectedly shifted the discussion to that of interoperability between different blockchains (Timestamp 5:04). In fact, in this battle between crypto/classical and crypto/crypto what we very well may end up seeing is more like a mesh of networks that are all connected, all working together to bring value to the consumer through the power of technology.eToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

But just what the distribution of Bitcoin nodes tell us about the rate of adoption of the top-ranked cryptocurrency on a global scale? Global Distribution of Bitcoin NodesAccording to a 2019 study by Themetafriend, there are 36 countries in the world with at least one percent of their population as Bitcoin users. This study assumed a relationship between the ratio of Bitcoin nodes in any two countries to that of the number of users in those countries.Using this ratio, it seems theoretically possible to examine the distribution of Bitcoin users worldwide. The following is an estimate of the number of Bitcoin users in different continents.Europe and North AmericaEurope and North America are hardly ever absent from any conversation related to technological advancements. Of the 36 countries where Bitcoin users make up at least one percent of their population, 26 are in Europe or North America.These nations include Canada, France, Belgium, Belarus, Germany, the U.K., and the U.S. Others are Lithuania, Luxembourg, Norway, Romania, Iceland, Slovenia, and Sweden.Looking at the current global nodes distribution as provided by Bitnodes, there is a high density of nodes in both Europe and North America. Also, of the top ten countries based on the number of nodes, only three (China, Singapore, and Japan), come from outside Europe and North America.South America, Asia, and AustraliaBack in November 2018, Bitcoinist reported that the total number of public Bitcoin nodes had surpassed 10,000. According to the latest figures from Coin Dance, the Bitcoin network currently boasts 10,071 listening full nodes and with over 61,000 nodes in total, according to other data sources.Apart from Japan and Singapore, South Korea, Australia and India also have at least one percent of their population as Bitcoin users. China, however, does not fall into this category making India\u2019s presence particularly noteworthy given the similarities in their population figures.In South America, Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina have the most BTC users. Venezuela does not appear to rank on a significant scale, however.AfricaIn Africa, only South Africa registers any significant number of users. According to the study, the southernmost nation in Africa has between 0.1 and 0.99 percent of its population as Bitcoin users. Places like Angola and Tanzania have between 0.01 and 0.099 percent.With access to electricity still a luxury in many places on the continent, the results from the study come as no surprise. According to Bitnodes, the highest ranked African nation based on the number of Bitcoin nodes, South Africa, is in the 33rd position (out of 100).Not the Full Picture of BTC AdoptionThe methodology by Themetafriend uses node distribution to determine Bitcoin users. It should be noted, however, that such a methodology might not show the entire spectrum of adopting technology as multifaceted as Bitcoin.For example, countries in Africa aren\u2019t running Bitcoin nodes (maybe due to inadequate electricity supply and/or lack of hardware), but the three of the top five countries on Google Trends for Bitcoin are from the continent including Nigeria \u2013 the country marked in orange (low adoption) on the map.Bitcoin adoption also involves such aspects as remittance, mining, acceptance for payments, infrastructure support etc. apart from running nodes.For example, it appears that Venezuelans aren\u2019t running a significant number of Bitcoin nodes, but the country continues to post massive figures on Localbitcoins.Unsurprisingly, places like China and Iceland where electricity is cheap but using BTC is restricted tend to be the leaders in mining.Businesses in countries like Japan and the Netherlands meanwhile are taking initiative in accepting BTC for goods and services.There are more BTMs in the United States and Switzerland, for example, as there is more emphasis on building Bitcoin-based businesses.

Coming four months after Bitcoin Cash, arguably the best-known Bitcoin fork, names such as Bitcoin Diamond and Bitcoin Gold failed to achieve credibility in the eyes of the industry. Commentators at the time accused development teams of simply trying to capitalize on the process to \u2018create money out of thin air.\u2019Bitcoin God, which also appeared in late 2017, was intended as a parody of the situation along the lines of Useless Ethereum Token, which had earlier mocked the ICO craze.For those forks that have in some way endured, questions still remain as to their true purpose or unique selling point. Sharing the DataLight piece, veteran trader Tone Vays said he was taken aback by the scale of hard fork activity on the Bitcoin network. He added:We all know that (Bitcoin Cash) (aka (BCash)) was the big one (and) has now split into (Bitcoin ABC) and (Bitcoin SV) but how different are they from the other 40+ on this ever-growing list?What do you think about the number of Bitcoin forks?

Bitcoinist | Feb 07, 2019 | 21:00 Share Tweet Send Share In a surprise move this morning, monetary policy in India has gone from tight to lose this morning. The drastic changes included an unexpected rate cut of 0.25% and many other measures designed to stimulate the economy ahead of the upcoming elections in three months time. This latest update seems to cement the government\u2019s influence over the central bank in the world\u2019s second most populated country.Perhaps the most telling is highlight number six below, which increases government subsidies to farmers by 60%.What does this mean?!?!In simple terms, India is joining a growing global trend where governments and central banks are failing to end emergency stimulus measures that have been in place since the financial crisis in 2008.In the short term, the markets are happy because they continue to receive support. On the flipside however, this is yet another clear sign that the global economy is not strong enough to stand on its own merit and continues to be propped up by the artificial stimulus measures and suppressed interest rates.We still don\u2019t know what the long-term effects of overstimulation might be as this has never happened before.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsDays to next Shutdown: 8 | Days to Brexit: 50FAANG Gets KickedBitcoin Mining MythsPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of February 7th.

There isn\u2019t much chance that they\u2019ll make any drastic surprises like India has though.Given that we\u2019re just seven weeks away from the current article 50 deadline, Governor Carney will do his best to maintain a market environment that is as stable as can be under the current circumstances.Other than Brexit however, the sense of \u2018smoother waters ahead\u2019 that we\u2019ve been highlighting since the beginning of the year does seem to be growing in the financial markets.FAANG Gets KickedDespite the market sentiment outlined above, it is very possible that some of the most popular stocks have accumulated maybe a little bit more value than they\u2019re actually worth.In yesterday\u2019s session, the FAANG stocks managed to underperform. Something they don\u2019t usually do.Some breaking news from Facebook seems to be dropping the shares slightly in after-hours trading at the moment as well.For myself, it\u2019s far more interesting know what Facebook has been up to in the blockchain space, which I had the opportunity to speculate on with Power Blocks the other day. Catch the show here!!Bitcoin Mining MythsAs we discussed yesterday, bitcoin\u2019s fundamentals are strong right now and it\u2019s also good to see the hashrate (total computing power of miners) of the Bitcoin network reaching a new equilibrium and evening out over the last few weeks.On that note, I did want to add a side note, or side link, to a blog an interesting blog I read the other day.As the title suggests, there\u2019s a great deal of counterarguments against the whole question of bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact. I\u2019m not gonna give you too many spoilers cause it\u2019s an excellent read but here are some highlights\u2026The author Robert Sharratt is probably one of the most qualified people on the planet to write on this subject as is confirmed by his LinkedIn page.Most bitcoin mining is done in Sichuan province where they have an overabundance of clean energy that would otherwise go to waste.If popular claims made against bitcoin are correct, the network will consume the entire global energy output (all electricity on earth) by Q2 2023.While we\u2019re on the subject of bitcoin mining, we can also highlight a new report from Canaccord Genuity Group that states Bitcoin is becoming more decentralized as it gets older.So at least we\u2019ve got something to read while this giant wedge plays out.Have an excellent day!eToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

With more members of Generation Z, who grew up in a world where smartphones were not an innovation, but a reality, this segment of the financial space is expected to grow tremendously in coming years. With more smartphones in people\u2019s pockets and an increasing number of countries shifting towards cashless economies, it is no surprise that many of the leading payment technology companies in the world are constantly working to introduce new and improved payment solutions. In 2016, the mobile payment market was valued at $601 billion\u00b9. By 2017, it grew to nearly $720 billion\u00b2, and it is expected to cross the $1 trillion milestone in 2019\u00b3. Forecasts suggest that it will continue to grow, reaching anywhere between $2.7 and $4.5 trillion by 2023. This growth will be prompted by many catalysts, which will both get more people to use mobile payments and make it easier for existing users to conduct more of their transactions with mobile devices.Going mobileThe introduction of mobile internet and smartphones placed mobile payment at the fingertips of billions around the world. As the industry grew, more users started using mobile payments, due to its seamless, frictionless nature. Moreover, using an application for making payments gives the user more transparency and control over their finances, with readily available data accessible anywhere, enabling them to track and manage their spending habits. The phenomenon grew to gigantic proportions, with sales events, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday bringing in billions in mobile payments each year.But the market is far from reaching its full potential. Alongside obvious growth brought upon by more people around the world obtaining access to smart devices, there is also growing trust in mobile payment systems thanks to companies such as Square placing a strong emphasis on security and fraud prevention. As the industry continues to mature, it is likely to attract more new users.Several recent innovations could bring new usability to mobile payments. Blockchain is becoming a global trend and several payment giants, such as Mastercard\u2074, have already introduced payment systems based on the technology. Other innovations could include increased promotion of e-Wallets, such as Apple Pay, and removing global barriers using services such as Wirecard.Meeting customers at the point of saleBut there\u2019s much more to mobile payment than online shopping. Using a smartphone instead of a credit or debit card at a point of sale is a phenomenon that is expected to grow, with contactless payment technology making the process intuitive and simple, while giving the user real-time information about their finances.As this becomes more widespread, it is likely that payment giants will try and leverage this form of interaction with the customer. Meeting a buyer at the point of sale opens up a myriad of business opportunities, since customers could be offered promotions and rewards relevant to them, based on their locations and even payment history. Combining payment technology with location services, artificial intelligence and big data, mobile payment could potentially have an even greater impact on in-store payment than it did on eCommerce.Investing in the mobile payment industryWith such strong growth forecasts and many opportunities still untapped in the market, it is no wonder that many investors are eager to take part in this well-established industry. To help its clients gain exposure to the mobile payment market, eToro has put together the MobilePayment CopyPortfolio \u2013 a fully allocated thematic investment portfolio focusing on the mobile payment market. Using this Portfolio, investors can passively invest in the segment in the long term, with stocks from leading companies such as Mastercard, Visa, PayPal and many others.Add MobilePayment to WatchlistSources:https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/press-release/mobile-payment-market.html https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/mobile-payment-market https://www.statista.com/statistics/226530/mobile-payment-transaction-volume-forecast/ https://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/mastercard-opens-access-blockchain-api-partner-banks-merchants/ eToro is a multi-asset platform which offers both investments in stocks and cryptocurrencies, as well as trading CFD assets.Please note that CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. 65% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

Of course, that hedge is Bitcoin. At the moment, Bitcoin (BTC) might not look like a more attractive investment option to the impartial eye. Gold appears to have bottomed at just above $1150 per ounce as stock markets begin to show signals of being overbought and signs on an impending financial recession have put smart money on alert.If you really want to hedge against the debt-based Ponzi scheme central banks run with printed fiat currencies, however, there\u2019s an alternative currency created for that very reason \u2014 Bitcoin (BTC).\u2018Better Than Gold\u2019According to some investment professionals with skin in the game, the first and foremost cryptocurrency is more attractive than precious metals.

It\u2019s like a CDS against fiscal and monetary policy irresponsibility.As noted by CNN, Kling takes issue with the current global debt situation and the way central banks have propped up growth. The United State\u2019s national debt is currently approaching 22 trillion USD and the Federal Reserve can no longer feasibly lower interest rates \u2014 a recipe many see as leading to another global financial recession.\u2018Beyond Any of Our Imaginations\u2019With fiat inflation and a loss of trust in the government\u2019s fiscal policies comes the mass adoption of viable alternatives.

Georgi Georgiev | Feb 08, 2019 | 09:00 Share Tweet Send Share Bitcoin hashrate, the computing power of the network, has hit levels last seen in November 2018. Bitmain-operated hashrate, however, has hit its lowest point in the last 16 months. Bitcoin Hashpower at a 3-Month HighAs of yesterday, February 7th, Bitcoin hashrate has hit over 50 quintillion hashes per second according to data from Blockchain.com.The last time the computing power of Bitcoin\u2019s network saw these levels was in November 2018.The rise in hashrate translates into new miners joining the network as the mining difficulty has dropped for the first time in 2019 by about 1.5 percent at the end of January.Bitcoinist reported at the beginning of the year that Bitcoin mining difficulty has adjusted 10% upwards for the first time in months as the hashrate started to stabilize following November\u2019s decline.The uptick could be a bullish sign for bitcoin price as some believe miners invest in the future spot price of bitcoin.\u201cPrice follows hashrate and hashrate chart continues its 9 yr bull market,\u201d says Wall Street veteran, Max Keiser.Others, like Casa CTO, Jameson Lopp, believe that its the other way around as miners are speculating on some future price of bitcoin. Lopp explains:Hashrate follows price. Some folks believe price follows hashrate, possibly because hashrate doesn\u2019t simply track ~spot~ price, but rather tracks some ~speculative~ future price. Miners are speculators too!Bitmain Losing Market ShareIn the first half of 2018, Bitmain-operated hashrate through Antpool and BTC.com was peaking. According to data from BTC.com, both pools attributed to over 40 percent of the entire network\u2019s computing power.Their dominance, however, has been shrinking ever since. At press time, BTC.com and Antpool combined control less than 30 percent of the network\u2019s hashrate, according to Blockchain.com.The last time Bitmain\u2019s share was so low was at the beginning of October 2017 \u2013 17 months ago.Indeed, the second half of last year has turned out to be rather challenging for the company as rumors of massive losses in the third quarter cast serious doubts over its financial condition.Bitcoinist reported in late 2018 that Bitmain\u2019s monopoly was collapsing as it put its mega mining facility project on ice in Rockdale, Texas. The company was laid off its entire Bitcoin Cash development team.In any case, as Bitmain loosens its grip on Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin mining seems to be getting more decentralized, which increases security and eliminates the possibility of a 51 percent attack.Is hashrate icreasing a good sign for price?

The cryptocurrency market is also up 10% as a whole at the time of writing. Bitcoin Price: 1 Day ChartAs Bitcoinist reported on Monday, we were expecting a volatile week and as Friday came it did not disappoint, with Bitcoin price 00 blasting out of its descending wedge, through resistance at $3500 and hitting the $3700 target, which we have been watching for some time.This level represents a significant level where the horizontal resistance at $3700 meets the descending diagonal resistance, so going into the weekend, BTC will have work to do if we are to see a push towards $4000.Weekly ChartA weekly close above $3500 will be significant for Bitcoin price, finding support on the 200-week moving average with a tweezer bottom and a bullish engulfing candle.This may open the door over the coming weeks to attack $4000 which would complete the Adam and Eve bottom pattern, pending a breakout which is being closely watched by traders both as an area of short interest and as a significant breakout level.Despite this, we must remember that we are locked in a bear market and the bears will very much see this as an opportunity to re-open short positions.Overall, this move implies that there are more buyers than sellers at the low $3000 prices and is encouraging.

It\u2019s just not how government expenditure works [\u2026] But government projects are often financed by a combination of taxes, deficit spending and other kinds of investments \u2013 you know, bonds and so on.The gamble envisaged is paying off the debt accrued later on through creation of new jobs forged by the stimulus. Ocasio-Cortez does not offer a price tag for the Green New Deal, but effectively describes it as incomprehensibly large.\u201cEven if every billionaire and company came together and were willing to pour all the resources at their disposal into this investment, the aggregate value of the investments they could make would not be sufficient,\u201d she states in an outline document.Instead, it would be the Federal Reserve which would step in and \u201ccredit\u201d the giant economic overhaul by printing more money that would likely exceed its 2 percent inflation target.The Green New Deal FAQ explains:The Federal Reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments and new public banks can be created to extend credit. There is also space for the government to take an equity stake in projects to get a return on investment.Bitcoin\u2019s Inflation Rate to Drop Below Fed\u2019s TargetOcasio-Cortez has become known as an antidote to the form of government policy actively promoted by the Trump administration. As Bitcoinist reported, however, various high-ranking members of the current setup in Washington are open supporters of Bitcoin, among them Trump\u2019s newly-appointed chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Having previously acknowledged Bitcoin\u2019s resistance to \u201cmanipulation by any government,\u201d Mulvaney was instrumental in setting up the ongoing Bitcoin Caucus in Washington in 2016, together with Colorado Governor Jared Polis.Trump has also attracted speculation of being \u2018good\u2019 for Bitcoin, but the sheer size of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s spending plans make his policies look moderate by comparison.Therfore, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal would likely drive monetary emmission above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2 percent target inflation rate. Interestingly, Bitcoin\u2019s the next block reward halving in May 2020, will see inflation drop to just 1.8 percent.Do you think Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s policy on spending could help Bitcoin?

Battle Of The MarketsNew research by TradeBlock shows that at their summer 2018 peak, combined trading volumes reached near-parity with spot trading volumes across five top US exchanges.Bitcoin futures trading volume has fallen significantly since peaking in the summer. The latest numbers from December 2018 show the lowest volumes since the products were launched in December 2017.What\u2019s more, the vast majority of that volume has been through CME. Whilst the two markets were initially neck-and-neck, the gap between them has steadily widened since February 2018.Volume grew rapidly following the products\u2019 launch, reaching a high-point in July 2018 when it topped $5 billion. At the same time, spot trading volume was falling at digital currency exchanges in the US. Across five of the largest US exchanges (Coinbase, itBit, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Gemini) it fell dramatically, from over $20 billion, down to just over $5 billion.Between January 2018 and October 2018, spot-trading volume fell 85%, following the general trend of the bitcoin price 00. Although volumes did start to pick up again in November and December 2018.Back To The FuturesMeanwhile, following the peaking of the futures market in July and August 2018, volumes almost halved in September and have fallen steadily since. The exception to this was November, when volumes spiked, following volatility and a number of price crashes.This decline in futures trading over H2 2018, coupled with the resurgence in spot trading, has seen spot trading volumes pull ahead again at the start of 2019.But 2019 will see the launch of several new bitcoin futures products, from firms such as Bakkt, Nasdaq, ErisX, and CoinFLEX. It will be interesting to see the effect of these platforms on volumes as they come live over the next few months.And of course, we may need to factor in the effects of volatility in price, should any also occur during this period.Will futures volumes rebound with increasing price?

Information about the events is scarce at the moment and aside from this CNBC article that covers the tweets from @Ask_WellsFargo there\u2019s virtually no mainstream coverage of the event as official spokespeople from the bank are keeping a tight lip.It seems different states are being affected differently but customers were urged not to deposit cash into ATMs as it might not show in their accounts. Reports of missing funds are arising.The outage seems to have been caused by either a power outage or smoke (or both, it\u2019s still not clear) in one of their Minneapolis data centers.Crypto advocates were quick to point out the advantage of decentralized money is its resilient nature. Data is maintained by thousands of computers working simultaneously and so there is no single point of weakness.Wells Fargo stock did drop yesterday but not by much.

All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsThe European trading session didn\u2019t go so well yesterday. Sour data had been coming in all morning, but the EU Economic Forecasts seems to be the straw that broke the camels back.Here we can see the economic calendar and the data that came in\u2026The economic forecast mentioned above is covered in a piece by Bloomberg titled \u201cEurope\u2019s Economic Outlook goes from Bad to Worse amid EU Warning.\u201dIf you think the title is fun, get a load of this graph showing the changes in GDP growth expectations.The DAX was the hardest hit but the US handoff didn\u2019t go so smoothly and by this morning the Asian session (sans China and the other countries who are still partying) is in a depressed state.If that\u2019s not enough to spook the markets, this headline certainly didn\u2019t make things any better.So, it seems the Kim Summit comes before China trade deal. So much for pragmatic Trump. Investors were hoping that a meeting between the leaders of US and China would cool the markets but it seems that tariffs could likely be ramped up before that happens.Litecoin SurgeWe\u2019re seeing some excitement from the Litecoin network this morning as we track a surge of about 14% so far this morning.The reason for the move wasn\u2019t immediately clear but it does seem to be having an impact on the rest of the crypto market, which are following it up.Many thanks to Matthew Willemsen for a quick response on Twitter with a few bullets that could be affecting sentiment.Sure the sponsorship of Mammoth Film Festival is good, and the fact that Travala travel booking site has added LTC payments is cool, but the clincher for speculators are the talks between the Litecoin Foundation and Beam about the possible upgrades to the LTC network.Many people also pointed to the Litecoin halving event that is coming up on or around August 5th.For myself, I\u2019ve been noticing something interesting about Litecoin lately, which is that the transactions per day seem to have bottomed out around 20,000 TPD. In fact, they\u2019ve been very steady around this level throughout the bear market.Bitcoin OversoldEven though the basic pattern that we\u2019ve been discussing on bitcoin lately is the gigantic bearish wedge, one analyst has pointed out that bitcoin is actually reaching oversold territory for the first time since it bottomed out in early 2015.Wishing each and every one of you an amazing weekend.Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalysteToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

Accepting cryptocurrency payments allows us to share that expertise with even more clients by removing many of the barriers that made it difficult to sell internationally before.

This price action comes only days before BitTorrent will airdrop BTT tokens to all TRX coin holders.TRON has been one of the best performing altcoins over recent months, with the much-hyped project seeing the price of its coin rise from approximately 0.00000262 BTC in August 2018 to as high as 0.00000861 BTC last month \u2014 an increase of over 228 percent for those who caught the bottom.Daily ChartCurrently, the price of TRON (TRX) is holding strong at a crucial support level on the previous resistance of approximately .00000725 BTC. Should the price of TRX continue to hold and consolidate at this level, it could be looking at another upwards push to 0.00001000 BTC before the first BitTorrent (BTT) airdrop occurs on Monday.However, that would be a very optimistic scenario \u2014 especially considering the fact that most airdrops and similar events in the cryptocurrency space lead to a sell-off prior to the event actually occurring.That said, TRX has had plenty of time to consolidate, so a sell-off could feasibly not occur over the weekend.On Binance, holders of TRON\u2019s coin will receive 0.11 BTT for every single TRX they possess at the time of the snapshot \u2014 which will occur on Monday.Stochastic RSIWhile some technical analysts currently predict the popular altcoin will break below this level and test 0.00000650 BTC, the daily Stochastic RSI suggests otherwise.The price of TRX is currently hanging out in oversold territory on the popular indicator and is at the cusp of crossing bullishly. This may be taken as a positive sign that the altcoin is looking to make another move up on the back of the BTT airdrop hype. However, this is only one of many indicators and is far from foolproof.As always, those looking to go long on TRX at these levels should exercise extreme caution and set logical stop losses. The altcoin has already been on quite a tear \u2014 which may be interpreted as both a sign of strength and as an indication that it needs to cool off and experience a substantial pullback.An entry point at 0.00000650 BTC would be more conservative than an entry point at its current level.What do you think about the price of TRON (TRX) before the first BTT airdrop?

Elsa Saikkonen | Feb 10, 2019 | 00:00 Share Tweet Send Share In approximately 179 days, Litecoin (LTC) will undergo a block-reward halving \u2014 cutting the coin reward for miners from 25 to 12.5 coins. With fundamental developments like confidential transactions reportedly in the works and the popular altcoin experiencing price-strength confirmation, how high will the impending halving hype push the price of the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency? [Disclaimer: The following article is not financial advice and should not be construed as such. Consult with a trained financial advisor before making any investment decisions. The author holds Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin (BTC).]If you\u2019re not accumulating Litecoin (LTC) right now, you might want to consider adding the altcoin to your portfolio.On August 8, 2019, Litecoin will undergo a block-reward halving, which will reward miners with half of the current reward for successfully validating blocks.The Bitcoin (BTC) block-reward halving typically garners all of the spotlights \u2014 and rightfully so. Such an event has historically impacted the price of the market-leading cryptocurrency in a positive fashion. Many experts are predicting that the next Bitcoin halving on May 24, 2020, will likewise trigger or spur on the next major bull run. With more people aware of this fact than ever before, it stands to reason that hype will build around Litecoin\u2019s earlier block reward halving as we progress through the year.Litecoin (LTC) Daily ChartLitecoin has successfully burst out of the 200-week simple moving average in astounding fashion following the announcement that confidential transactions are in the works for the so-called \u2018silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold.\u2019With such a dramatic spike in volume and convincing push above the crucial moving average, it is within reason that Litecoin has officially entered a new bull market.That said, Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market are still firmly in the control of the bears \u2014 so assuming that Litecoin is officially out of the woods may not be particularly wise.Litecoin (LTC) Monthly ChartThe monthly chart for Litecoin against Bitcoin paints an interesting picture leading up to the halving in August.The 50-month moving average on Bitfinex is providing resistance at this very moment. A break above this monthly moving average is entirely possible \u2014 in which case, it would be nice to see it provide support in the coming months.The stochastic relative strength index (RSI) is just starting to come out of oversold territory against the first and foremost cryptocurrency. It is clearly heading upwards and is showing clear signs of bullishness.Of course, one should never FOMO (fear of missing out) into a cryptocurrency. Nothing ever goes straight up or straight down. However, we may be in the buy-the-dip territory now with Litecoin\u2019s fundamental developments and August halving still months away.What do you think of the price of Litecoin (LTC) in the months leading up to the August block reward halving?

Hougan says he expects the coming reckoning to wipe away the many worthless coins currently in existence, much like during the dot-com era.95 Percent of Cryptos Are \u2018Useless\u2019Appearing on the Masters in Business podcast hosted by Barry Ritholtz, the Bitwise head of global research offered up striking parallels between the present day cryptocurrency industry and the dot-com era of the late \u201890s and early 2000s.I think those parallels are accurate. It \u2013 I think it is the next dotcom. But remember, the dotcom bubble created pets.com but it also created Amazon.Commenting on the future of the industry, Hougan declared:\u2026[T]here are 2,000 cryptocurrencies out there, 95 percent of them are useless and will die a painful death. The sooner that happens, the better.However, Hougan doesn\u2019t expect this purge to sound the death knell on the burgeoning industry. Instead, the Bitwise executive expects the thinning of the herd to initiate the emergence of useful cryptocurrencies.There are numerous commentators in the industry today who agree with the idea that many cryptocurrencies are indeed worthless. This belief has led to the popularization of the term \u201cshitcoin\u201d [sic]; referring to cryptos with little or no economic merit.Hougan isn\u2019t also the first to comment on the parallels between cryptocurrencies and the early days of the internet. If history does repeat itself in the form of a crypto-crash, it stands to reason that the surviving projects will be to the industry what Amazon, Google, etc. are to the internet.Cryptocurrency Value Chain Still Years From Full RealizationDuring the interview, Hougan also highlighted the unique selling point of cryptocurrencies that exist at the core of decentralized technology; the ability to execute transactions without requiring an intermediary party. According to Hougan, real-world applications of this ability will have significant implications on the \u201ccost of trust.\u201dHowever, the Bitwise executive conceded that it was still early days with a lot more work still required before cryptocurrencies can reach their full potential. According to Hougan, the current UI for virtual currencies leave a lot to be desired especially from an ease-of-use standpoint.If the purge does occur, which cryptocurrencies do you predict will come out the other side?

The increase in size comes as Lightning gains publicity beyond the Bitcoin technical community thanks to a user-driven initiative getting other familiarized with how the network works.Specifically, Lightning Torch, a relay transaction being bounced between nodes, has already gained participation from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in what became a widely-publicized event last week. Calls have since come for other well-known faces such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk to follow Dorsey\u2019s example and further expand awareness of Lightning.According to 1ML, there are currently a total of 6048 reachable nodes and almost 25,000 channels, while capacity has reached 660 BTC ($2.39 million). Hitting The BigtimeAs Bitcoinist has reported, the goal of the Lightning Network is to allow huge numbers of Bitcoin transactions to occur instantaneously and with next to no fee required.Since the mainnet protocol debuted at the start of 2018, developers have sought to iron out technical inconsistencies, meaning aspects such as user interface and overall ease-of-use remain a challenge.Third parties have already built and released simple Lightning-based products such as wallets, but the network overall still requires work before it can scale to accommodate mass transactions of any size.Nonetheless, Dorsey among others has hinted of interest in taking the technology mainstream. Tweeting around his participation in Lightning Torch, he added he \u201cloved\u201d the concept of potential Bitcoin micropayments embedded in Twitter, ostensibly to improve the quality of content. Such a setup would follow on from more payment-driven platforms, such as Daniel Larimer\u2019s three-year-old but somewhat controversial Steemit.

With the 2018 lows beckoning, we take a closer look at the price action. Weekly Chart The weekly chart for Bitcoin illustrates that Bitcoin [price 00 is now being capped by $3500 and is drifting towards the $3100 range, which evoked a buying response pushing the asset up 30% towards the end of December.The MAC-D indicator illustrates that although Bitcoin\u2019s price is still in a downward trajectory, the momentum of the move is declining. This is not necessarily a bullish underlying indicator but it suggests that the bears are losing selling interest as we approach levels of notable support.The Key levels to watch for the week will be Bitcoin trading above the prior week opening $3500 and what occurs if Bitcoin is pushed towards the low $3,000s.As reported last week, the institutional interest appears to come into play on breaks of key support so a failure by the bulls to defend $3,000 could see a sharp decline to the downside.Daily ChartThe Daily chart shows that Bitcoin is still trending within the falling wedge towards support. The so-called \u2018falling wedge\u2019 is a bullish technical pattern, which if played out would imply an upside target of $3700 would be in sight, although this would mean overcoming the heavy resistance at $3500.In order to invoke such a powerful move to the upside, it would likely mean that there needs to be a hard test of $3250 and below, which would be met with significant buying interest.The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which shows buying and selling pressure by combining price and volume, was trending above zero last week, has been another also a sign of underlying buying pressure, despite the overall price decline.There are five days at most remaining before the falling wedge pattern will ultimately draw to a conclusion so we are expecting a volatile week.Trade Bitcoin, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

Eustace Cryptus | Feb 10, 2019 | 06:00 Share Tweet Send Share On Friday Litecoin kickstarted a phenomenal rally which led the entire market higher. Can Ethereum continue to gain on its own or will Bitcoin and Litecoin price action mirror Ethereum\u2019s future course? Ethereum Price: Market OverviewEthereum 00 and Litecoin both staged amazing rallies over the past few days. Bitcoin\u2019s strong upside move shifted it above many overhead resistance levels and it seems both Ethereum and Bitcoin both saw a double bottom (ETH @ $100). Now a growing number of analysts are beginning to forecast whether the entire market has bottomed. 4-Hour ChartThe 5MA is beginning to cross below the 10MA as ETH consolidates in preparation for its next move. The altcoin still trades above the 50MA and in spite o the recent pull back the 12EMA remains crossed above the 26EMA on the 4hr chart and ETH looks to be setting a higher low above the exponential resistance.The Stoch has turned down from overbought territory while the RSI reflects ETH current state of consolidation as it has flatlined in bullish territory. The MACD also remains bullish and at the time of writing the CMF and order book show the current price action biased toward bulls so it seems traders believe the rally still has legs.Obviously, anyone who has been looking at a cryptocurrency chart over the past year will remember that Bitcoin\u2019s price action remains an auxiliary threat to nearly every altcoin except Litecoin and Binance Token for the time being. Meaning, while any combination of technical indicators might flash bullish for ETH, a sharp pullback in BTC price is bound to be curtains for the current set up. ETH-USD Shorts ChartThe number of shorts continues to drop, a pattern also observed on the BTC-USD shorts chart which shows bearish interest dropping to a 2 month low. ETH remains bullish above the 26ema ($114) and below this point, ETH could drop to the 100 MA at $112 but at the time of writing the order book shows substantial purchasing interest at $114 so there is the possibility of a bounce at $114 for those looking for a quick scalp.

Companies and investors are excited at the prospect of a new, more dynamic way to offer and trade securities, but there are several roadblocks in the way before this technology can reach its full potential. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) led the last token craze, but the market quickly stagnated as regulatory bodies like the SEC cracked down on ICOs. Regulators claimed many utility tokens issued by ICOs were thinly veiled, unregistered securities, causing investors to slam the brakes.STOs are seeking to solve these issues by registering tokens as securities and building compliance directly in to their platforms. Much talk has been made of \u201cborderless securities\u201d and \u201cautomatic compliance,\u201d but without new blockchain protocols, the lofty promises made by security token proponents could remain a pipe dream.Crafting borderless and compliant securities is such a challenge because nearly every country has its own unique and complex securities regulations. Building a compliant token in one country could automatically make that token illegal in another. Security tokens are meant to comply with current securities laws, but right now the task requires navigating such a confusing labyrinth of legislation that truly borderless securities may be a long way off.One option that could be promising for borderless security tokens are areas like the European Union, where compliance in one country means that businesses can operate in other member countries with ease. However, current blockchain networks make EU compliance impossible.The EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires companies to delete user data after leaving their networks. Since blockchain works on the premise of immutable, self-referencing data, deleting user information on current blockchain protocols is not feasible, leaving security tokens at another dead end.However, new technological developments could eliminate this barrier to security token adoption. German blockchain startup Lition is developing a second layer solution on top of the popular blockchain platform Ethereum that would allow security tokens to be GDPR compliant, and open the doors to borderless securities within the European Economic Area.Lition is accomplishing this by building a new breed of blockchain, combining a public mainchain with private, deletable sidechains, allowing the network to both provide blockchain functionality while protecting user data through GDPR compliance. This hybrid model offers a competitive advantage over other blockchain platforms hoping to provide infrastructure for STOs.Figure: Lition Blockchain data separation and deletion conceptSecurity tokens have the potential to update securities for the digital age but the road to widespread adoption still has several hurdles to clear before it can make good on the promises of borderless, compliant securities. Platforms like Lition are presenting a way to roll out this new technology by providing concrete technical solutions to the legislative barriers that have held back so many blockchain ideas.As of late, the rallying cry echoing through the blockchain space has been, \u201cwait for blockchain-specific legislation.\u201d Lition is saying no, there is not time to waste. The community must keep building and pushing this revolutionary technology forward.Images courtesy of Shutterstock.[Editor\u2019s Note: This article is a guest submission authored by Stephan Vogel, Head of Business Development at Lition.

Bitcoin is Not a Company Bitcoin while being universal, open, and borderless, might still be an opaque concept to some. This could explain the gaffe that appears in a January 30, 2019 article from The Times of Israel where the paper said \u201cthere was no immediate reply from Bitcoin,\u201d meaning the publication had reached out to Bitcoin concerning the story.The story in question was Hamas; the militant Palestinian group, asking for donations in Bitcoin to continue its offensive against Israel. The paper even goes as far as repeating tired rhetoric of Bitcoin\u2019s use in procuring illegal items.One wonders how the paper \u201ccontacted Bitcoin\u201d seeing as it isn\u2019t a payment company like PayPal. Once again, mainstream organizations show their lack of understanding of the subject matter. This ignorance doesn\u2019t, however, stop them from spreading false information about the revolutionary payment technology.Maybe they erroneously thought either Bitcoin.com or Bitcoin.org was the \u201cofficial website\u201d for Bitcoin. The latter is indeed written on the Bitcoin whitepaper.

Guide for the Most Popular Cryptocurrency.\u201dViability of Bitcoin for Terrorist FundingMeanwhile, on the subject of Hamas calling for funding via Bitcoin, numerous experts have argued against the viability of using cryptocurrencies to fund terrorist activities. Last Tuesday (Jan. 29, 2019), Hamas called on its supporters to aid its cause by sending bitcoin donation.Abu Obeida, a Hamas spokesperson, published a note on Instagram, saying:The Zionist enemy fights the Palestinian resistance by trying to cut aid to the resistance by all means, but lovers of resistance around the world fight these Zionist attempts and seek all possible means to aid the resistance.However, reports by both U.S. Intelligence and Europol say Jihadists are yet to leverage cryptocurrencies in their terrorist activities. The studies confirm that cash is still king as far as terrorist funding is concerned.Furthermore, the enactment and enforcement of robust KYC/AML protocols are sure to make virtual currencies a far less viable proposition for jihadists as the transaction ledger is public and completely transparent. Plus, these organizations don\u2019t exactly operate in technological utopias meaning, converting crypto to cash is sure to be a tedious endeavor.What do you think about the gaffe in The Times of Israel article?

Once dubbed the \u2018bond king,\u2019 Gross like many others in mainstream finance, offered his opinion about Bitcoin. On the occasion of his retirement, here are some of his more famous remarks about Bitcoin.Bitcoin Better than Central BanksBack in 2016, while Warren Buffett was calling Bitcoin a mirage, Gross declared that he preferred the popular cryptocurrency to central banks. At the time, Gross while saying that central banks were needed to provide stability, also opined that they operated like casinos.Consequently, the bond king suggested BTC as a possible haven asset for investors looking to move away from the volatility and declining interest rates in the mainstream markets. Commenting further, Gross noted:Bitcoin and privately agreed upon blockchain technologies amongst a small set of global banks are just a few examples of attempts to stabilize the value of current assets in future purchasing power terms. Gold would be another example \u2013 historic relic that it is. In any case, the current system is beginning to be challenged.Bitcoin is a Poor Substitute for Fiat and GoldFast forward two years later, at the height of \u201ccrypto mania,\u201d Gross took a complete 180, this time saying that BTC was a poor substitute for both fiat and gold. This time, Gross pointed at the difficulties in using BTC for making payments.The retiring bond manager also said BTC wouldn\u2019t be viable investment alternative during times of economic distress. Analysts at JPMorgan recently offered up a similar argument, declaring that Bitcoin would only have value in a dystopian economy.Back in 2017, Gross pointed to Bitcoin\u2019s high volatility as a major reason why the top-ranked cryptocurrency wouldn\u2019t serve as a viable store of value. At the time, BTC was in the midst of meteoric price increase which would see the cryptocurrency reach an all-time high of $19,700 less than a fortnight after Gross\u2019 comments.For the billionaire bond manager, Bitcoin\u2019s bull run was down to an influx of investors looking to put money in riskier, short-term, and high yield assets. At the turn of the following year, BTC and the rest of the cryptocurrency market would face a massive correction, with prices declining by an average of 80 percent.What do you think about the changes in Gross\u2019 opinion about Bitcoin over the years?

Gox Bitcoin Dump Killed Last Summer\u2019s Price Rally, New Report Suggests Osato Avan-Nomayo \u00b7 @3rdPesinSingula | Feb 05, 2019 | 17:00 Share Tweet Send Share A new report by GoxDox, allegedly shows that Mt.Gox trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi dumped bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges despite maintaining claims to the contrary. Leaked documents presented in the report point to a massive Bitcoin dump to the tune of $312 million.The Mt.Gox Bitcoin DumpeningAccording to GoxDox, the Tokyo Bitcoin whale ignored the advice of Kraken CEO, Jesse Powell, on the modalities for the Mt.Gox bitcoin sale. At the time, there were fears of what a massive selloff could do to the stability of the market.Rather than heed the advice of \u201cexperts and stakeholders,\u201d GoxDox alleges that the Mt.Gox trustee decided to go with Japanese Bitcoin exchange platform, BitPoint. As proof, GoxDox also revealed payments made by BitPoint in Japanese Yen to the Mt.Gox Estate from February 2018 to June 2018.Back in March 2017, Bitcoinist reported on the sale of $400 million worth of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash by Kobayashi. At the time, the trustee revealed the sale occurred between December 2017 and February 2018.In March 2018, the trustee stated that he sold bitcoin OTC (over-the-counter):I sold BTC and BCC from December 2017 to February 2018 with the cooperation of a cryptocurrency exchange in light of the market price at the time of the sale. Following consultation with cryptocurrency experts, I sold BTC and BCC, not by an ordinary sale through the BTC/BCC exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the extent possible. The method of sale of BTC and BCC was approved by the court as well.Unfortunately, the report doesn\u2019t show any payment records before February 23, 2018. But the next round of payments commenced at the start of May 2018. Oddly enough, Kobayashi moved 8,200 BTC from the Estate\u2019s cold wallet, also at the beginning of May 2018.Coincidence or CausationThe consistent stream of JPY payments from BitPoint to the Mt.Gox Estate within the period of the known bitcoin selloffs raises a few questions. Assuming Kobayashi sold $312 million worth of BTC to BitPoint, how (and when) did the platform go about its own sale if at all?The answer might lie, like GoxDox posits, in studying the BTC price chart between May and June 2018. After accumulating significant gains in April, Bitcoin price almost broke $10,000 at the start of May, which is when BitPoint began allegedly buying from Kobayashi.However, from that point onwards, the price began a steep fall, setting a new 2018 low at around $5,800 by the end of June. Therefore, GoxDox suggests that BitPoint promptly dumped BTC on exchanges pushing price lower in mid-2018.Lending credence to the theory is the fact that BitPoint also released a statement in 2017 announcing its enhanced ability to process large BTC orders. Excerpts from the announcement translated from Japanese read:In late January 2017, we set up a special window (*) for large OTC transactions, respond to large trading demand, and advance the expansion of covered business partners and improve liquidity in virtual currency transactions.Do you think Kobayashi sold to BitPoint who then sold BTC immediately on exchanges?

Not for investors in the BitTorrent (BTT) ICO that occurred on Jan 28. The company that led the charge in peer-to-peer file sharing on the web just made history with a sell-out ICO\u2013and gains of 870% in just one week.Tron\u2019s Justin Sun Bought BitTorrent Last YearMost people have heard of BitTorrent, one of the most effective ways of transferring files around the internet. Functioning since the early 2000s, BitTorrent allows users to download heavy files faster by splitting the work.So, instead of taking forever to download a 900MB file from a single source, BitTorrent uses multiple people who have the file and allows you to download it in bulk from several sources at the same time. Genius.But since BitTorrent has been working more or less successfully for almost two decades, and has over 100 millions users, you may ask\u2013why the need for its own token?Well, it certainly has something to do with the fact that BitTorrent was acquired by Tron\u2019s Justin Sun in June 2018. As he said in a press release at the time:In one giant leap, we can introduce blockchain to hundreds of millions of users around the world and empower a new generation of content creators with the tools to distribute their content directly to others on the webIncentivizing File Sharing Through CryptosBut it also seems to have been spurred from Project Atlas, a blockchain project that provides incentives through cryptocurrency for file sharing. The current BitTorrent system, as Sun explains in the below video, doesn\u2019t provide users with any real incentive to share their files or keep them online once they\u2019ve finished downloading a file.This, he claims, creates inefficiencies in a system that many would say has worked fairly well so far without the need for a BTT token.In other words, by having its own BTT token, users will now receive incentives in BTT for sharing files and keeping them online. Downloading will be quicker and users can even opt to pay for additional bandwidth if they need to download a file faster.The BitTorrent (BTT) ICO Was a Roaring SuccessJust glancing at the downward volume over last year, ICOs seemed to be becoming a thing of the past.ICO Funds Raised 2018/ https://www.icodata.io/stats/2018But the BTT ICO held on the Binance Launchpad sold out in just 15 minutes raising $7.2 million in fundsThe price per BTT was set at $0.00012 and investors could purchase BTT with Binance Coin (BNB) and Tron (TRX) only.59.8 billion BTT tokens were sold on Jan 28, proving the naysayers that ICOs are not dead but still very much alive and kicking\u2013and that BitTorrent has a real use case for a token.But here are a couple of facts even more interesting than a sell-out ICO. At the time of writing, the BTT token 00 has already soared in value by an eye-watering 870% in just one week.For context, throughout the same period, Bitcoin lost some three percent, while Ethereum gained not quite three percent. The impressive 870% in seven days is a gain not seen since the ICO hype a year ago. But perhaps contributing to an even bigger smile on the Tron founder and BitTorrent CEO\u2019s face is the fact that he the BTT market cap is now $150 million or $10 million more than the price Bittorrent was acquired for.Very well played indeed.Will the BTT token see a correction after such impressive gains?

BTC/USD 00 has officially endured the longest bear market in its history. Its fall from all-time highs of $20,000 in December 2017 formed the downside of what has become a boom-and-bust cycle for Bitcoin. As Bitcoinist reported, a run-up, crash and slow build-up to a new high has in fact characterized BTC/USD since its inception. Studying the numbers today, however, suggests that after 14 months, the pair is finally ready to reverse upwards from its trough. UTXO numbers have already bounced to levels last seen in October 2018 \u2013 before the Bitcoin price dramatically lost one third of its value a month later.Several months prior to that event in June, the total daily transaction count on the Bitcoin network had begun rising \u2013 a trend which continued with the exception of the price breakdown week in November.That number \u2013 around 335,000 transactions on February 4 \u2013 has not been achieved since January 11 last year, when BTC/USD traded close to $13,000.How Low Can Volume Go?One value which has yet to U-turn meanwhile is trade volume. As the Bitcoin price has fallen, traders have appeared to turn to investors, harboring coins in the hope the market will turn in their favor. USD exchange volume is now lower than at any time since May 2017 \u2013 at the time, BTC/USD traded at a maximum of $1800 \u2013 the start of a six-month build-up to a new all-time high.In December, analysts were still predicting Bitcoin would ultimately bottom at around the all-time high seen at the peak of its last bullrun in 2013 \u2013 approximately $1300.

The first and foremost cryptocurrency is currently trading at $3373.13 on Bitstamp at the time of this writing. 84 percent of Bitcoin\u2019s current price is $2833.43, meaning an increase of the same percentage would equate to a year-end price of approximately $6206.56.Digital Capital Management\u2019s CEO, Ben Ritchie, submitted the highest predicted price by guessing Bitcoin would finish 2019 at $9500.Ritchie\u2019s guess stems from a belief that Bitcoin will remove itself from the rest of the cryptocurrency market while institutional investors slowly start making use of high-quality onramps from the likes of Bakkt and Fidelity Group. He stated:Two things to look out for in 2019 will be whether we will see decoupling of the cryptocurrencies, as to date they have trended in a relatively similar manner.The second is the impact of the traditional markets on cryptocurrencies. Will bitcoin rise if the S&P drops? On-ramp and off-ramps to purchasing cryptocurrencies will improve in 2019 with Bakkt and Fidelity Group entering the market. However, I do not believe we will see many institutional investors enter for some time yet.Ritchie\u2019s prediction was above the average, however, of beneath $7000.Catalysts: Bakkt and FidelityBakkt indeed continues to make waves in the Bitcoin-investment market, having acquired some assets of Rosenthal Collins Group (RCG), a longstanding independent futures commission merchant.Likewise, Fidelity Digital Assets is reportedly planning on launching a Bitcoin Custody Service as early as next month, which is expected to make on-ramping institutional investors easier than ever.What do you think Bitcoin\u2019s price will be at the end of 2019?

What they\u2019re working on or how it will be rolled out is still very much a mystery as the behemoth company is holding their cards very close to their chests.In $FB\u2018s latest earnings report they announced 2.32 billion monthly active users, which if accurate, is a third of the world\u2019s population. So it makes sense that they\u2019re hiring the folks from Chainspace who are reportedly experts in smart contract platform scalability.What might not be obvious is the unbelievable deal they\u2019re getting due to the bear market.

Not only does it intend to better the entire industry but its model also means to seriously benefit each individual investor. Here are 5 reasons for which you don\u2019t want to miss the GG World Lottery\u2019s STO.Multi-Billion Dollar Industry in Need of DisruptionThe global lottery industry managed to generate more than $273 billion in ticket sales in 2017 alone. That\u2019s more than a quarter trillion spent throughout the world. Lotteries have been around for quite some time and, obviously, they show absolutely no signs of slowing down.However, the industry itself faces a lot of issues. The currently existing legacy lotteries are failing to catch up with what\u2019s contemporary and user-friendly. In addition, they\u2019re cutting corners when it comes to transparency, user experience, and whatnot.This positions GG World Lottery uniquely, enabling the project to enter a particularly vast market which is in desperate need of disruption \u2013 something that the project is created for.GG World Lottery will introduce regulated, government-backed lotteries which are mobile-friendly and cater to the requirements of different demographics.Additionally, it takes advantage of a True Random Number Generator and blockchain technology to guarantee both the true randomness of the draws as well as the transparency and immutability of the processes.It\u2019s Beneficial for All PartiesYou know a project is good when it keeps all of the participants in mind. GG World Lottery benefits unparalleled convenience for the players. They will be able to purchase their tickets at any time from any place, regardless of their current whereabouts, using nothing but their smartphones or any other mobile device.On the other hand, its model is also beneficial for the operator itself. The full online distribution will allow the team to cut the costs significantly without having to narrow down the player base.And here comes the beauty of it, reverting back to the players. Not only will GG World be able to operate the lotteries more conveniently and, hence, efficiently, but the reduced costs will also allow them to guarantee higher prize pools and to support local charities and initiatives.In other words, the lotteries will benefit the players, the operators, as well as the entire local community where they are based.Multiple Ways to Establish an Income StringWhen it comes to investment, it\u2019s all about returns. That\u2019s natural.With this in mind, GG World Lottery has made sure that all of the participants can establish a diversified income string coming from multiple sources.Starting off, the project has devised a very comprehensive dividend scheme which entitles token holders to a lifetime share of the revenue based on every single GG World Lottery Jackpot prize win. Therefore, every time someone wins the Jackpot, each individual investor will win together with him.Additionally, the project has created a very lucrative affiliate system. A total of 5 percent from the token supply is reserved for payouts made through the affiliate system.Moreover, as mentioned above, the project is devoted to giving back to the community through different initiatives such as Charities and Good Causes.Naturally, users can also take part in state of the art lotteries and take their chance at winning massive jackpots.A Reputable Team of ExpertsPerhaps one of the most important things to look forward to in an STO project is the team of professionals behind it.GG World Lottery pride itself as one of the projects who\u2019s backed by industry experts with years of experience in the field.Mark Hutchinson, CEO and President at GG International has 35 years of global lottery industry experience and it\u2019s one of the leading experts in emerging markets. He was also a founding member of the Lotto America startup (Powerball, the world\u2019s largest lottery game).Wojcieh \u0141ysak, the founder of GG International, is a renowned expert in international solutions and has over 15 years of experience in online gaming entertainment and online marketing.A Diversified ApproachGoing above and beyond, the company also offers additional services to the market in an attempt to diversify its value proposition. Its comprehensive white-labeling solution is amongst them.WhiteLotto, as the solution is dubbed, enables the user to seamlessly set up a lottery business in a rather easy and frictionless manner. Instead of having to go through the burdensome process on their own, users can rely on WhiteLotto to assist them in incorporating the necessary company structure, payment processor contracts and the needed licensing.As you can see, there are plenty of reasons not to miss the GG World Lottery\u2019s STO. You can find out more about the project and take part in the offering on the official website.You can also stay tuned on the project\u2019s Facebook and Twitter page or join the live Telegram group if you have any questions.What do you think of GG World Lottery?

This move comes as part of the government\u2019s efforts to regulate the industry with laws for initial coin offerings (ICOs) expected later in the year.Registration Requirements for Bitcoin ExchangesMalaysia\u2019s Securities Commission (SC) on Thursday (January 31, 2019) announced amendments to its Guidelines on Recognized Markets, introducing regulations for cryptocurrency exchange platforms. The country\u2019s financial regulatory watchdog said that platforms looking to operate in the country have until March 1, 2019 to register with the SC.As part of the amended guidelines, Bitcoin exchanges must conform to a corporate organizational structure. Top executives of such businesses must also have a clean criminal record, in addition to possessing demonstrable experience in trading markets.According to the newly released guidelines, platforms must also show proof of robust security measures to protect investor funds. The SC says it will only approve registration of cryptocurrency exchanges that are capable of contributing to the country\u2019s emerging digital economy.Embargo on New Account OpeningsWith the newly amended guidelines released by the SC, bitcoin exchanges in the country are now in a transitional period. During this time, platforms cannot open new trading accounts for customers.Commenting on the need for cryptocurrency trading rules, Datuk Syed Zaid Albar, the head of the Malaysian Securities Commission, said:The new framework is part of the SC\u2019s efforts to promote innovation while ensuring investor protection in the trading of digital assets.ICO Regulatory Framework Still in the WorksBack in November 2018, Guan Eng, the country\u2019s Finance Minister hinted that regulations for bitcoin exchanges and ICOs would emerge before the end of Q1 2019. However, the recent guidelines by the SC do not contain any rules for ICOs.In a media briefing held earlier in January 2019, regulators said Malaysia\u2019s ICO laws could include regulations covering investment thresholds and standards for white papers. According to the SC, white papers for cryptocurrency investment projects would conform to the same standards as IPO prospectuses.Clear-cut regulations for Malaysia have been a long time in coming following. In November 2018, Muhammad Ibrahim, the Governor of the country\u2019s apex bank said the country needed robust auditing and reporting measures for the emerging asset class.Malaysia joins other countries in Southeast Asia in developing a regulatory framework for virtual assets. In 2018, Thailand released detailed regulations for ICOs and cryptocurrency exchange platforms and granted licenses to four exchanges last month.What do you think about Malaysia\u2019s newly enacted regulations for Bitcoin exchange platforms?

In other words, the vehicle designed with institutions and large volumes in mind, enables prospective speculators to loan bitcoin or other digital assets in exchange for USD collateral and facilitates the action of high volume speculative short-selling on the market at spot prices.Bitcoin is by far the largest asset in their portfolio accounting for 75% of total interest but the platform enables the same actions across the larger crypto assets.In their 2018 Q4 insights report, Genesis Capital reveal that November and December were the most active months to date with a market increase in hedge fund interest.\u2026we originated an additional $500 million in Q4 alone, bringing our total originations to $1.1 billion in 2018. Thus, Q4 loan originations increased more than 100% in the final three months of 2018 compared to the prior six-month period.From the chart shared, it is clear that although there has been steady growth in the use of the platform from the end of November, there was an increase from around $800m to $1.1bn by year end. The report goes on to state that institutions saw BTC price breaking below $6,000 being an opportunity to \u201cpile on with unprecedented size.\u201dWhile the report does not state the number of bitcoins loaned in totality, they are likely to be between 150,000 and 200,000 bitcoins on the basis of an average selling cost in the vicinity of $6,000.Bigger Than Bitfinex and CME FuturesTo put this into context, short-sellers at one of the biggest spot exchanges, Bitfinex, reached all-time highs of a little over 40,000 bitcoins in December and CME and CBOE futures contract trade with significantly lower volumes despite many claiming that their traded contracts have influenced spot price.It is unlikely that the break of $6k was actually led by the platform as traders typically wait for confirmation before loading on size. But there is little doubt that the velocity and ferocity of such large volumes being dumped on the market provided the depth to take prices lower towards $3k.It is unclear how many of these positions are open to date, but the impact is significant.Ultimately the capital invested will aim to exit in profits by rebuying the coins to return to the lender, which will result in significant buying pressure on the market.A large price breakout to the upside will likely put the funds under some pressure to temporarily close out the positions in profits. However, what we know for certain is that a drop below significant support is likely to result in new short-selling interest.Good News For Bitcoin HoldersIn some consolation to long term bitcoin bulls, the report goes on to mention that cash lending is also an area of demand. In reverse to the aforementioned, this enables bitcoin holders to use their bitcoins as collateral to loan USD.Genesis going on to state that,Most clients are using the cash to invest, sometimes even in the same asset they posted as collateral to with most clients.This, therefore, enables Bitcoin bulls to leverage their existing positions to go long, although it would be fair to say that the intitutions are likely to have more firepower at their disposal than BTC holders, particularly when prices are in decline.The report concludes in stating that they are excited about the growth of the platform for 2019. At the same time, the findings highlight other significant drivers in the market, which have so far been largely unrecognized by retail traders and investors.Trade Bitcoin, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

One of the most corrupt institutions of our time proclaims that cryptocurrencies would only have value in a \u2018dystopian economy\u2019 in which investors had \u2018lost all confidence in all major reserve assets.\u2019 Max, naturally, fights back.Bitcoin Was Born Out of DystopiaThe statement from the bank partially responsible for the 2008 financial crisis fails to pick up on the irony. After all, Bitcoin was born out of a dystopia caused by large banks like JPMorgan that then had to be bailed out with taxpayer money. Keiser says:The value of Bitcoin today reflects the level of \u2018dystopianism\u2019 that we are currently experiencing\u2026 JPMorgan and other banks are rogue banks that are committing massive fraud and they\u2019ve got the central banks on behalf of us, the taxpayers, to print lots of fiat money to bail them out even though it means that the overall wellbeing of society is being destroyed.According to Keiser, JPMorgan is the first beneficiary of the fraud. He says that Jamie Dimon\u2019s net worth crossed over $1 billion \u201cby nickel and diming people to death.\u201dWe already know how highly Keiser holds JPMorgan and Jamie Dimon in his esteem.\u201cAlways have at least 90% of your port in Bitcoin. Anything less and you\u2019re undermining Bitcoin\u2019s ability to defeat fiat. Leave alts to dickheads like Jamie Dimon,\u201d he told Bitcoinist last December.The Yellow Vests in FranceKeiser then made a reference to the Yellow Vest protests in France. Despite the image circulating the web of one protester wearing a sign saying \u201cBuy Bitcoin,\u201d they may not be about the cryptocurrency at all. However, the protests do reflect deep-seated social unrest caused by rising inflation. And the fact that it\u2019s the same old story on repeat. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.It\u2019s not a phenomenon limited to France, or even developing countries in Latin America or Asia, either. According to the Federal Reserve, in the United States, younger Americans have earned less over the last 30 years. The older ones, on the other hand, earn more.The Great Wealth Divergence:Over the last 30 years, younger Americans (as an age group) have become poorer and older Americans have become richerhttps://t.co/IrC9NRVIet pic.twitter.com/cXMpN0hbt8\u2014 Conrad Hackett (@conradhackett) January 28, 2019Max Keiser Drives It HomePouring scorn on the World Gold Council report that claims to prove that Bitcoin is not a safe harbor asset and is no substitute for gold, Keiser vehemently disagrees.To really get Satoshi\u2019s vision, it\u2019s peer-to-peer gold\u2026 that\u2019s what Bitcoin accomplishes, that\u2019s what Bitcoin is, fight me on this, go ahead, but you\u2019re wrong.He also went on to say that Bitcoin as digital cash was \u201cnegligible,\u201d but that as digital gold it was world-changing.#Bitcoin as unparalleled digital Gold is world changing. Bitcoin as \u2018digital cash\u2019 is negligible.\u2014 Max Keiser, tweet poet.

All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsThe clock continues to wind down on our three main political dramas\u2026Brexit (March 29th). With the politicians seemingly no closer to a deal, and no indication whether there can be a time extension, many companies are already starting to announce their contingency plans for a no deal Brexit.US Government shutdown (February 15th). Both sides say they\u2019re working hard to avoid the next shutdown in two weeks but there hasn\u2019t been much notable progress on this.US-China trade talks (March 1st). The only thing that actually does seem to be moving forward at the moment. Apparently, Trump has reached some sort of preliminary agreement with Chinese ambassadors and would like to seal the deal in person with President Xi. With the deadline just one month away, let\u2019s hope they remember that February is a short one.Volatility has notably faded since the beginning of the year but is still well above normal levels. Here we can see the VIX volatility index over the last two years.What oddly doesn\u2019t seem to be having much impact is that Italy has now fallen into a recession. Stock markets are rather mixed today.Jobs Day on Wall StreetYup, it\u2019s that time of the month again. It\u2019s gonna be extremely difficult to follow last months performance though.The US economy reportedly added 312.000 jobs in December and analysts are forecasting that today the government will announce a gain of about 165,000 jos in January. Overall, job growth in the United States has been pretty steady since the crisis.A weak number today can be forgiven fairly easily, especially after last month. A super strong number, on the other hand, could cause some concerns that the economy is overheating.If we see anything over 250,000 it could likely cause analysts to claim that the most recent Fed announcement was actually a policy mistake.We also have about 20 more companies reporting earnings today. It seems Amazon disappointed investors, but not in a concerning way. See if you can spot anything funny about this headline.Investors have a long history of getting upset at Amazon for reinvesting their profits rather than distributing them but we can probably say that this strategy has been responsible for their explosive growth.Bitcoin ETF \u2014 Clock ResetYesterday investment firm VanECK caused a stir by announcing they are re-submitting their application for a bitcoin backed ETF.For those of you who haven\u2019t been following, the crypto community has been hoping that an ETF will be opened up to Wall Street investors so that they can invest in bitcoin without having to worry about things like opening an account on an exchange or storing their private keys.VanECK had a very solid proposal sitting on the SEC\u2019s desk but ended up withdrawing it due to the government shutdown. That was last Thursday!!On the graph below there are two purple circles. The first is when they withdrew their application on January 23rd, the second is the time of the announcement last night.As we can clearly see, the market is not being affected very much by all this.Why would they withdraw the application only to resubmit a week later?Well, it\u2019s all in the timing. The first application had a hard deadline for the SEC to approve or reject it by February 27th. By starting the application process over, they\u2019re basically buying themselves a lot more time.If the previous process was any indication, we could be looking at a final answer from the SEC by August or September. In the meantime, that should give plenty of time for the market to mature in the way that the SEC is looking for. By then we will likely have a running service by Bakkt, bitcoin futures on the Nasdaq, and a trading and storage platform from Fidelity.Wishing you a peaceful weekend.Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalysteToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

By the dawn of the next decade, there can be millions of them as long as the world\u2019s regulators don\u2019t ban initial coin offerings altogether. There are, of course, pretty solid reasons why regulators can be worried. Tokendata stats suggest that 59% of all projects that had held an ICO, failed to some extent, or even proved to be scams. Thousands of articles, blog posts, and statements from officials and crypto industry stakeholders stress that crypto is, at very best, a very young industry and still an experiment, so the risks involved in crypto investment are huge.Still, the apparent easiness of increasing your investment tenfold overnight attracts lots of people to such projects. The problem is that there are so many of them that even seasoned investors may feel confused. Is there any way to determine if a project can make it? In fact, there is more than just one method.Is It a Scam?That\u2019s probably the first question potential investors should ask themselves. There is a pretty high probability that at least some ICOs you have heard of today are run by dishonest people who cared only to develop an attractive landing page without even thinking about creating an actual product.So, how do you tell a real ICO from a scam? There can\u2019t be 100% certainty in anything, and everything can potentially have a different explanation, however, there are certain red flags any potential investor should heed when evaluating an ICO.Whitepaper: It\u2019s a very important part of any project. While it usually doesn\u2019t have any legal weight, and, technically speaking, is nothing more than a glorified prospectus, this is the exact place where the project\u2019s team explains what they\u2019re after, and, most importantly, how and when they\u2019re going to accomplish it. If there is no whitepaper, that is a very bad sign. If there is one but it is sloppy, offers unrealistic profits or timelines, and drones on and on about the same thing without actually answering any questions, it\u2019s also a fair reason to doubt the project. Finally, some projects even go as far as to plagiarize someone else\u2019s whitepaper, which basically should dispel all the doubts: if the project steals someone else\u2019s text, it might as well steal something else.The team: There can be very good reasons for a team to remain anonymous. However, in most cases it should look a little suspicious when people who ask you to give them money don\u2019t even introduce themselves. However, scammers don\u2019t usually opt for staying incognito. Instead, they find little known pictures of some foreign actors and place them on their landing pages under different names. While a honest team may want to stay beyond the spotlight for some reason, it will not lie to your face about the team\u2019s identities. So, make sure that the people the projects tells you are its team are real, and their credentials check out, which includes their social media accounts.The technology: Blockchain is a real buzzword for many industries, so there are lots of companies who claim they apply the tech in their operations. But ask yourself: is it really necessary to add blockchain to this particular use case? Is it possible that it could have worked great without distributed ledgers? At very best, you\u2019re looking at a project that seeks to ride the hype. At worst, it\u2019s yet another scam. The same goes for the project\u2019s source code: if it\u2019s not available, not being developed, or just doesn\u2019t make much sense to anyone who has relevant expertise, the project is probably a scam.Will It Work?While those measures are just about basic reason, they cannot insure you against falling for a scam. The bad guys are aware of the red flags as well, so they devise new techniques to fool people.Still, scams aren\u2019t the only danger when it comes to investing in ICOs. Some projects are honest but fail due to unrealistic expectations, unsound planning, and other issues related to the team\u2019s proficiency. Is it possible to tell such projects from those that can succeed?The short answer here is no. Any professional investor or venture capitalist will tell you that almost 99 per cent of all projects they have invested in have failed. Keep in mind that those people are really good at telling the wheat from the chaff. When it comes to business in general, there are too many factors that are reasonably beyond anyone\u2019s control, so there can be no certainty.However, even if the certainty isn\u2019t an option, is there a chance to detect projects that are more likely to make it? The answer is yes, there is. The thing is that if you can\u2019t rely on your own judgement, you\u2019ll have to rely on someone else\u2019s.See if there\u2019s a prominent and well-respected figure involved in the project. And it can\u2019t be a celebrity that promotes it. It has to be someone who had been involved in the industry for years, someone who has done other good things that you know of. If such a person deems a project worthy of his or her involvement, that means the chances of eventual success go up a little bit.Another option is quite specific to the crypto industry. Blockchain tech has enabled the creation of provably fair prediction markets, and, as it turns out, the collective wisdom of thousands of people returns pretty good results. There are at least three prominent and well-respected projects of this kind, namely Augur, Gnosis, and Wings, and each of them offers a decent functionality, though the first two focus on any sorts of predictions, while the latter is more about estimating the ongoing fundraising events in the cryptoindustry.Basically, a prediction market works similar to ask the audience on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? The difference is that they answer the questions to which nobody at the moment knows the right answers, such as \u2018who will play in the next Super Bowl?\u201d, \u201cwill it rain this time in three months?\u201d, or \u201cwill project X become successful?\u201d The answers coming from thousands of other people eventually draw a probability picture for a certain outcome, and, as it turns out, the most popular answers tend to be the correct ones in most cases.ConclusionThere is no way to know f0r certain if an ICO eventually gets successful, and the project lives up to its promise. Any investment is a game of chance at its heart, and there can be no safety net except for your own reason. But investment is also a game of skill, the greatest rule of which is to never put in more money than you can afford to lose. No matter how you choose your winners, you should always keep that in mind.The Rundown Is It a Scam?Will It Work?Conclusion"}

It also appears that \u2018blockchain technology\u2019 is being used as little more than a buzzword tacked on to traditional rewards points for completing post-ride surveys.Very little seems revolutionary about this news.

For the Twitter and Square chief, Bitcoin, the top-ranked cryptocurrency seems best-suited to that role.Commenting on the possibility, Dorsey said:I believe the Internet will have a native currency and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Bitcoin. I think it will be [Bitcoin] given all the tests it has been through and the principles behind it, how it was created. It was something that was born on the Internet, was developed on the Internet, was tested on the Internet, [and] it is of the Internet.In the past, Dorsey has made similar remarks, commenting in May 2018 that Bitcoin should be the native currency of the Internet. Thus, Dorsey says Square\u2019s focus is solely on BTC with no present plans to offer support for other cryptocurrencies on the Square Cash App.Bitcoin Enables Better Financial InclusionDorsey explained to Joe Rogan that Bitcoin adds another dimension to the goal of creating easier access to financial services. Elaborating on Square\u2019s decision to offer support for the popular cryptocurrency, the CEO said it gave the company the ability to serve more people across the world far better than was possible using mainstream channels.Dorsey likened the Internet to a single nation that exists digitally. Thus, it only makes sense that it would have its own universally accepted currency.Present-day fiat money is usually subject to nationalistic policies that might not appeal to different places across the globe. Bitcoin, however, is based purely on mathematical algorithms providing a certain sense of neutrality and universality devoid of any geographical or political bias.Banks Hate Bitcoin\u2019s DisruptionDorsey also touched on the attitude of banks and other stakeholders in mainstream finance towards Bitcoin. Unsurprisingly, banks and many other financial institutions aren\u2019t fans of Bitcoin\u2019s disruptive tendencies, the Twitter CEO said.Earlier in January, JPMorgan analysts released a report claiming that BTC\u2019s value could only exist in a dystopian economy. In 2018, \u2018nocoiner\u2019 Warren Buffet infamously called Bitcoin \u201crat poison squared,\u201d which, oddly enough, implies that the banks are the rodents.However, he also touched on the philosophical aspect of Bitcoin changing people\u2019s perception of what constitutes value.

This year was different.According to Bloomberg, the overarching theme of the conference focused on traditional banking \u2014 with topics such as branchless lending and \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 taking center stage.SWIFT vs. RippleThe highlight of the conference for the cryptocurrency crowd was the battle between SWIFT CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt and Ripple Labs Inc. CEO Brad Garlinghouse. The latter likened the two companies to Amazon and Wal-Mart, while Liebbrandt stated:Banks are not ready for a model where you convert into a crypto and then convert back again. It\u2019s not clear to us that blockchain is better than what we have today.Who Cares?With a conference regularly dominated by those interested in, at most, \u2018disrupting\u2019 the traditional banking system, viable cryptocurrencies \u2014 such as Bitcoin (BTC) \u2014 really have no place. The first and foremost cryptocurrency wasn\u2019t made to provide blockchain solutions for financial institutions and traditional banks. It was made to provide individuals the opportunity to be their own bank while rendering third-parties irrelevant and traditional banks unnecessary.Unless you are an XRP bagholder or one who truly believes cryptocurrencies\u2019 primary usage is to make banks operate better, this year\u2019s vibe at the PFF shouldn\u2019t concern you.What do you think about the Paris Fintech Forum\u2019s reported disinterest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology?

The move prevents further litigation against the company for 30 days while it attempts to recover missing funds.QuadrigaCX owes its customers about $180 million in cryptocurrencies plus $70 million in cash. The company allegedly lost access to its funds following the death of the CEO who had sole custody of the private keys to the platform\u2019s cold storage.Lawyer for Quadriga says there may be as much as $180-million of crypto \u201cfloating around out there\u201d that they haven\u2019t found.\u2014 Jack Julian (@JackJulian) February 5, 2019According to Jack Julian of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) who covered the proceedings at length, QuadrigaCX lawyers expressed hope that a stay of proceedings would allow the company to recover the lost funds \u201cto the extent that they exist.\u201dDuring yesterday\u2019s hearing, a few revelations came to light. First was that the platform had neither an office or a bank account. It\u2019s only legal proof of existence was the business registration in British Columbia.Thus, all administrative operations of the company were domiciled on the owner\u2019s laptop (Gerald Cotten). The reported passing away of Cotten further complicates the matter as he supposedly died without revealing his passwords.Hunt for Missing QuadrigaCX Bitcoin ContinuesAnother startling revelation was the admission by QuadrigaCX lawyers that some cryptocurrencies had been \u201cfound.\u201d Maurice Chiasson, lead counsel for the platform, asked the court to grant the legal team authority to oversee the recovery of these cryptos into a single wallet.The Judge, however, ruled that a court-appointed monitor would be in charge of such an operation. To that effect, a lawyer representing a group of creditors prayed the court also to grant custody of all encrypted USB drives as well as the late owner\u2019s laptop which might contain missing funds.Another twist to the saga comes from allegations on social media that there are no missing funds. These reports say the platform had no cold wallet storage but instead had funds scattered all over different exchanges.We have thousands of wallet addresses known to belong to @QuadrigaCoinEx and are investigating the bizarre and, frankly, unbelievable story of the founder's death and lost keys. I'm not normally calling for subpoenas but if @rcmpgrcpolice are looking in to this, contact @krakenfx\u2014 Jesse Powell (@jespow) February 3, 2019Last Saturday, Kraken CEO, Jesse Powell tweeted that his platform had several wallet addresses that belonged to QuadrigaCX.

Well, San Francisco-based Abra just made cryptos more accessible with their global investment app.The investment app lets anyone invest in traditional stocks and ETFs, as well as over 30 cryptocurrencies straight from their smartphones. It also provides non-custodial accounts with funds secured on the Bitcoin blockchain.There are quite a few cool things about the Abra app that make it an interesting prospect. In a world with unequal wealth distribution and restricted access to investment opportunities, Abra makes investing possible to (almost) all. To start with, rather than having a high entry fee, investors can start with as little as $5.This is to make investing in stocks and bonds more affordable. It also means that not only can investors own a fraction of a bitcoin or ether, but they can now own a fraction of a stock and high-priced ETF as well.Some of the options on offer in the initial rollout are popular tech stocks like Google, Amazon, and Netflix. There are also commodities like SPDR Gold Trust.Abra CEO Bill Barhydt said:Investing in stocks can be a daunting, complex and decidedly exclusionary activity\u2026 We are building Bitcoin-backed investing products because, for the first time, we can truly democratize access to investment opportunities at global scale.Secure and Private TechnologyEven more interesting for Bitcoin fans is the fact that the Abra app is non-custodial. The funds are stored on the Bitcoin blockchain and the app uses smart contracts as the underlying technology for users\u2019 investments. This means that Abra users will never have to trust the company with their money or worry about losing their funds to hackers. Their transactions are also more private as they are not held in a centralized database.Where Can I Get Abra?The Abra app is already available for download on Google Play and the Apple Store. Users can create an account inside their phone and link it to their bank account, or send payments with cryptocurrencies. They can send payments through bank transfers, credit cards, and cryptocurrencies to access any asset in the app. And also exchange all major fiat currencies for multiple cryptos and send instant transfers to other Abra users.When you couple rising smartphone penetration around the world with a technology that allows almost anyone to gain a foothold in previously off-limits investments, Abra\u2019s proposal is definitely worthy. It\u2019s also a world-first, attracting investment from the likes of American Express Ventures, Foxconn Technology, and First Round Capital.What do you think of the non-custodial ability to invest in cryptocurrency?

Though the Zcash vulnerability has now been remedied, it took 8 months after discovery, and some coins remain exposed.Zero KnowledgeLast March, a Zcash engineer noticed a mistake in a cryptography paper describing certain \u2018zero knowledge\u2019 proofs. Zcash (ZEC) 00 and several other coins, use these proofs to enable many of their privacy features. The mistake meant that an attacker could mint an infinite amount of ZEC (or any other affected coins) without detection.Zcash kept the discovery quiet; only the small team working on the fix knew about the issue. Team members used encrypted communications to reduce the risk of insider leaks or hackers finding the vulnerability.In October, eight months after discovery, the bug was surreptitiously patched during a planned network upgrade. Although Zcash have stated that they do not believe the bug was exploited, they cannot be certain.Infinite CoinsWhile all this was going on, the other affected projects were kept in the dark. But after implementing their own fix, the Zcash team informed security staff at Komodo and Horizen. These two represented the majority of the market cap of other affected coins, amounting to $72m and $22m respectively.Both of these projects have subsequently implemented patches, but other smaller privacy-coins were still vulnerable at the time of announcement. This included Bitcoin Private, with an $18m market cap, who have a contentious history with Zcash.Research unearthed evidence of a covert pre-mine of Bitcoin Private, and the resulting controversy is blamed for tarnishing Zcash. CEO, Bryce Wilcox, explained:We didn\u2019t want to disclose to more parties until the majority of the exposed market cap had already been protected.Subtle VulnerabilitiesThe disclosure states that the \u201cvulnerability is so subtle that it evaded years of analysis by expert cryptographers focused on zero-knowledge proving systems.\u201dA commentator on Twitter pointed out that \u201cbleeding edge crypto is risky;\u201d and that although Bitcoin has less privacy features, this leads to a safer system.

If those don\u2019t hold I\u2019m looking at 2900~It\u2019s also worth noting that institutional interest appears to come into play on breaks of key support levels. Therefore, a failure to defend $3,000 could see a sharp decline to the downside.Closer to the Bottom?At the same time, Bitcoin transaction metrics are beginning to reflect similar historic bottom-pattern-forming lows.There appears to be more demand than supply at $3,000, though it remains to be seen if this key psychological support will hold to form a double-bottom pattern, to the hope of the bulls.At the same time, USD exchange volume is also at its lowest point since May 2017. This was the point which marked a massive buildup to Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high of about $20,000 in December 2018.To some reprieve for the bulls, block reward halving from 12.5 to 7.25 BTC, Bitcoin \u2018halvening\u2019 may soon come into play with the event now 15 months away. Speaking on the matter, research head at Blockchain, Garrick Hileman said:Cryptocurrency markets are often very event-driven, and as we get closer to the next halving bitcoin\u2019s price will receive a boost from those anticipating the forthcoming reduction in new supply. In the months leading up to the last two halving events, we saw bitcoin\u2019s price steadily trend upward, and then power higher following the reward halving.What do you think of the current Bitcoin price?

Jackson Jr. The Commission\u2019s lone Democrat expects a Bitcoin ETF filing to eventually satisfy all of the required standards set forth by the body.SEC-Approved Bitcoin ETF is Not ImpossibleSpeaking during a soon-to-be-published interview with Congressional Quarterly, Jackson stated his belief that an SEC-approved Bitcoin ETF is inevitable. So far, the Commission has rejected all prior filings submitted by different funds looking to launch a Bitcoin ETF.Robert J. Jackson Jr.In the excerpts from the interview shared by Adjunct Professor at NYU Stern, Drew Hinkes, Jackson explains:Eventually, do I think someone will satisfy the standards that we\u2019ve laid out there? I hope so, yes, and I think so. Getting the stamp of approval from the deepest and most liquid capital markets in the world is hard, and it should be. Once we make it available to everyday mom and pop investors, we are taking risks that Americans can get hurt.Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF RejectionJackson\u2019s comments are in many ways indicative of the argument consistently put forward by the Commission against Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC has in the past brought up issues relating to liquidity, custody, and market manipulation.Emphasizing these points, the SEC Commissioner touched on the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF rejected in July 2018. According to Jackson, the decision to deny the application stemmed from the inability of the trust to satisfy the SEC\u2019s standards on preventing fraud and market manipulation.Commenting further, Jackson said:The case that we had last year involving the Winklevoss trust, in my view, was not a difficult case. So there you had a situation where the risk for manipulation and for people getting hurt was enormous. The liquidity issues in the market were very serious.At the time, the Commissioners voted 3-1 against the Winklevoss ETF with the only \u201cyes\u201d vote coming from Hester Peirce. According to Peirce, the SEC was wrong to reject the ETF, saying the Commission failed to interpret its own laws correctly.Meanwhile, the quest for an SEC-approved BTC ETF continues in 2019. At the start of the year, Bitcoinist reported that Bitwise had filed another application after having been rejected by the SEC in 2018. After initially withdrawing the VanEck/SolidX BTC ETF proposal, Cboe refiled the application a few days later.The Winklevoss twins also stated that they will keep pursuing approval of their COIN Bitcoin ETF, particularly after Gemini become the first to pass SOC-2 examination.In early January 2019, they stated:We are committed as ever to making an ETF a reality! The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) could regard Gemini\u2019s SOC-2 report as a factor in favor of its possible approval of Winklevoss\u2019 petition for a Bitcoin ETF.Will an approved Bitcoin ETF have any significant impact on BTC price?

Over the last two and a half weeks, a new bitcoin game called \u201cpass the torch,\u201d has been growing in popularity.The game involves a user, who can be anyone from the crypto community, receiving a transaction through Bitcoin\u2019s lightning network, then adding 10,000 satoshis (approximately $0.34) and passing the entire pot to the next player.The fun was started on January 19th by @hodlonaut. So far the torch has changed hands 153 times and the pot is up to 0.0286 BTC ($94.61). Last night, the game was kicked up to the next level when the torch was passed to the founder and CEO of Twitter and the CEO of Square, Jack Dorsey.Now, to say that Jack is a bitcoin advocate is a bit of an understatement. Over the weekend, he was on the air with Joe Rogan stating that bitcoin will probably become the native currency of the Internet.Engaging the community on Twitter yesterday he stated several times that the only coin he holds is bitcoin. He also said that he views it as a currency rather than an investment and that he wouldn\u2019t consider holding any other coins, not even Ether.The Square Cash App has recently become a major on-ramp for people buying bitcoin. When asked yesterday whether Square would add other cryptos to the Cash App, Jack replied with a simple \u201cNah\u201d@MatiGreenspaneToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsDays to next Shutdown: 9 | Days to Brexit: 51Technical IndexesBitcoin Real Use RisingPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of February 6th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsPerhaps for the first time since he became President, Donald Trump has publicly spread a message of unity and bipartisanship.In the annual State of the Union Address last night, Trump drew cheers and applause from both sides of Congress as he urged Republican\u2019s and Democrats to work together as one.This is a stark contrast to what we\u2019re used to hearing from the controversial President Trump. Many were expecting that he might use the speech to declare a state of emergency in order to procure funding for his Southern Border wall but instead, he made a very pragmatic case, backed by logic, statistics and expert testimonies, for why it is necessary. Nobody could have seen this coming.Of course, it does depend largely on how the Democrats respond, but I would venture to say that there is now a much greater chance to avoid another government shut down.Over in the UK, it seems that things are taking a turn for the better as well with this article from the Telegraph circulating widely this morning.To be clear, when I say \u201cbetter\u201d what I mean is we\u2019re likely to see more certainty, which is what the markets really care about. Definitely not taking a political stance here.Somehow, it seems that the overall market conditions have been cooling over the last month or so we can see volatility sloping steadily downward.Getting TechnicalThose of you who are familiar with my analysis know that I tend to focus more on the fundamentals and use technical analysis more for emphasis. Every once in a while technical analysis turns into a story that can be counted as fundamental analysis.Right now for example, we can see that the 200-day moving average, one of the most prominent technical indicators, is making headlines.It\u2019s not just the S&P 500 either. Many major stock indices are now testing their 200 days average price.Bitcoin Gaining while LosingUnlike the stock markets which tend to adjust for underlying metrics rather quickly. The price of bitcoin remains characteristically detached from its own fundamentals, instead remaining subservient to technical analysis.In Monday\u2019s market update (titled: Good Luck!!) we gave a technical update that showed bitcoin once again was coming to the point of a giant descending triangle.The nature of this particular pattern is that the flat line (psychological level) is usually the one that breaks first, as it has done six times over the last year. This could be why we\u2019re seeing some losses this morning.However, if we look at the fundamentals of the Bitcoin blockchain, they\u2019re actually quite strong!!By looking at this graph we can easily see that the number of transactions being processed in bitcoin has been growing increasingly during the bear market and is now reaching levels that have previously been seen only during the 2017 bull run.A quick look at the volumes from the peer to peer bitcoin trading site local bitcoins, which is now back online, will show you that usage is rising steadily in emerging market countries such as India, Kenya, Nigeria, and across Latin America.Of course, these metrics are difficult to evaluate over time due to the extreme volatility in bitcoin\u2019s price. As we can see in the global graph often times more BTC will be traded when the cost per coin is lower.However, for those citing reduced volumes across crypto exchanges lately, what I can say is that you\u2019re missing the big picture.The volume traded across global crypto exchanges has indeed come down from their peak last January of $70 billion to now about $15 billion a day. What we need to remember though is that this is a brand new market and to see volumes leveling out at these amounts is an incredible feat. Especially considering that the first time daily volumes ever exceeded $1 billion was in Q2 of 2017.For me anyway, this is more of a glass half full scenario. Or even if some might see the glass as only a quarter full, it still contains liquid that previously did not exist and now holds value.Have an awesome day!!Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalysteToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

Furthermore, the move is almost certainly a move to provide Coinbase users with something they have been lacking for years \u2014 a proper wallet that actually puts users in control of their cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets.For those still interested in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC), Coinbase is looking to add support for both of the altcoins in the near future.In other news, Coinbase also just added support for PayPal in European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries.What do you think about Coinbase Wallet and the better-late-than-never addition of Bitcoin (BTC)?

While Dorsey used the occasion to hint at direct involvement between Twitter and Bitcoin payments, however, attention has already focused elsewhere.A similar long-term proponent of Bitcoin, Musk is a natural follow-on for the Torch, users were claiming on Twitter Thursday.\u201cI propose that every torch bearer from now makes a tweet to (Musk) to get him to pick it up!

Keep in mind that it\u2019s definitely not a way of avoiding taxes. Bitcoin is simply another legal way to receive payment for goods and services. So, you\u2019ll have to declare the payments as you would with traditional ones.Use QR Codes or Run a Full NodeIf you run a physical store, your customers should be able to pay through a mobile phone app or hardware terminal. There are several apps that generate QR codes for mobile and wallets that support QR code scanning for payments.This makes payments much simpler as customers don\u2019t have to enter an address. They can use a quick recognition (QR) code that is machine-readable, like a box made up of black and white squares.If your business is web-based, you\u2019ll need to run a full node (or ask a proficient programmer to implement one for you). This is especially important if you sell big-ticket items.While you can use payment processors such as BitPay or Coinbase, running a full node will give you greater speed when it comes to transaction confirmations. It will also give you additional security of genuine payments with no possibility of fraud.Hang a \u2018Bitcoin Accepted\u2019 SignIf you\u2019re going to accept bitcoin payments, you\u2019ll need to let people know. This means adding a \u201cWe Accept Bitcoin\u201d sign to your door if it\u2019s a physical store, or to your website for online businesses.People can then contact you for details of how to pay using bitcoin. You\u2019ll probably find that this won\u2019t make up a significant portion of your business just yet. However, you will increase awareness among customers curious to learn more.Add Bitcoin Payments to Your InvoicesIf you already add a line explaining what payment options are available (VISA, PayPal, etc.) you can simply add Bitcoin as well, even if customers have to contact you to find out the steps.If you\u2019re good at programming or know someone who is, an effective way to track bitcoin payments is to generate Bitcoin addresses and print them on each new invoice. This will cut out the customer having to contact you for the details. It will also ensure that when the payment arrives, you\u2019ll know where it\u2019s meant to go.Be sure to let the customer know how much BTC to send since the fluctuations in price are likely to confuse them. While Bitcoin addresses on a paper invoice are incredibly cumbersome, according to Bitcoin Wiki, you should probably add them anyway. Most people need some kind of paper trail when it comes to accounting. Having the address will allow the customer to prove the transaction took place through Block Explorer.If your customers are paying via your website, simply provide them with a URL to visit that displays the Bitcoin address to send the payment. If they can do this just by entering the invoice number, so much the better. They can also copy and paste the address easily. Be sure to use a new address for each invoice\u2013that you use only once. This way, you can keep track of who the payments are coming from and for what.How Do You Set a Price in Bitcoin?This is not an easy question to answer since, with bitcoin\u2019s volatility, prices can vary on any given day, sometimes dramatically. The way most merchants manage this is to quote clients based on the current market rate at the time of the price quote to the customer. This will likely be determined by a weighted average basis of prices across multiple exchanges.When you receive bitcoin payments, the best practice is to immediately convert it into the fiat currency you need to run your business and cover costs. Holding onto bitcoin payments can be risky. If you\u2019re holding onto payments in the hope that the price will go up, you\u2019re placing your business at risk and may leave yourself open to headaches from the IRS. Immediate exchanges will remove the risk of price fluctuations for bitcoin payments.If you do want to take payments in bitcoin, check with your account first for advice on how to report them since tax compliance will vary depending on where you live. Also, there will always be some discrepancy between the price you quote and the price you receive, which may need to be accounted for in a specific way.As a rule of thumb, however, Bitcoin payments are really just like cash, so consider how you handle cash transactions and whether you pay tax on them and do the same for Bitcoin.How About Simpler Solutions?As mentioned, there are easier and faster payment gateways for accepting bitcoin, but you give up full control over the transactions. If you want to work with a payment processor but keep the benefits of running a full node, try BTCPay Server. It\u2019s one of the best open source payment processors out there and includes an invoice API that\u2019s compatible with BitPay.You can also migrate your code base to your own self-hosted payment processor, which gives you all the benefits of running a full node with less of the hassle. BTCPay is easy to deploy via the one-click deploy on Azure.There are further details on how to install BTCPay here. And if you\u2019re not completely confident, simply ask a programmer for help. Either way, be sure that you run a full node for web payments unless you\u2019re simply planning on experimenting with small infrequent translations.What other ways can businesses start accepting bitcoin?

In fact, the last time the total cryptocurrency market cap saw double digits was in August 2017.$3,100 \u2013 Key Level to Watch for BitcoinThe analyst also outlined that a key level to watch for Bitcoin is the $3,100 mark.\u201cA break below the fourth-quarter lows at $3,100 would imply a decline to $2,270, while a move above $4,200 is needed to signal Bitcoin is beginning to improve,\u201d he said.Bitcoinist reported this week that Bitcoin is in for volatile days ahead.

The bulls will be looking to find their legs on any retracement following the inevitable profit taking after an 11% move on Friday.Daily ChartLooking closer at the daily position, Bitcoin price action last week was ultimately capped buy a combination of the declining diagonal resistance and the horizontal resistance meeting at $3,700.This is now a critical level to overcome in order for BTC to avoid being trapped inside another bearish triangle, which would take the cryptocurrency below $3,000 and most likely extend the bear market for a number of months.The bulls, therefore, likely need to put in a higher low, somewhere between the 78.6% and 50% retracement $3,400 and $3,500, which will need to be met with bullish volume to take bitcoin price out of the Bearish triangle and avoid a retest of the low $3,000s.4 Hour ChartTaking a closer look at the 4-hour chart, it appear that BTC is already up against it on Monday morning following a rejected attempt by the bulls to finish close to $3,700 on Sunday evening.With the chart beginning to look all too familiar as a so called \u2018Bart\u2019 pattern, implying downside risk.The Mac-d shows that momentum is bearish, but is still above zero. We can also see a gap in volume on the VPVR, which would imply that a fast more could occur down to $3,400 should $3,500 fail to hold up.On a more bullish note, if the current price action can resolve bullish on Monday and Tuesday, with a close above previous highs, there is little resistance between $3,760 and $3,950, which would be a very positive move for the bulls.Trade Bitcoin, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

Experts at IT security firm, Eset tipped off the company to the presence of a fake MetaMask app on the Google Play Store.Clipper Malware Impersonating \u2018MetaMask App\u2019Lukas Stefanko, a malware researcher at Eset, published the news on the company\u2019s website last Friday (February 8, 2019). According to the post, Eset experts found a malicious app \u201cAndroid/Clipper.C, purporting to be MetaMask.The report indicates that Ethereum owners who downloaded the app could have their private keys compromised and their funds stolen. Like other clippers, this malware could also hijack the clipboard of the victim replacing their Bitcoin or Ethereum address.MetaMask allows users to run decentralized apps (DApps) hosted on the Ethereum platform via a browser add-on without having to run the full network node. Currently, the service has no mobile app.Android/Clipper.C isn\u2019t the first app to impersonate MetaMask on the Google Play Store. Back in 2018, Google removed the previously available MetaMask mobile app which seems to have left room for many malicious iterations of the service.Usually, these faux-MetaMask employ phishing techniques to gain access to user funds held in cryptocurrency wallets. Meanwhile, MetaMask in November 2018 announced plans to relaunch its mobile app following the continued success of the browser add-on which has more than one million total downloads.Cryptocurrency Theft via Clipboard HijackingThe pivot of these malicious apps impersonating MetaMask from phishing to clipping is indicative of the growing menace of cryptocurrency theft via clipboard hijacking. In July 2018, Bitcoinist reported that a clipboard hijacking malware was monitoring about 2.3 million Bitcoin addresses.Since wallet addresses are composed of a lot of alphanumeric characters, most people copy and paste them when carrying out transactions to avoid costly errors. These malicious apps target this practice by hijacking the user\u2019s clipboard replacing their addresses with those of the attacker.To avoid falling victim to clipboard hijacking, cryptocurrency owners should endeavor to upgrade their antivirus software. Also, it is essential to eyeball addresses before \u201cpressing send.\u201d Five minutes of due-diligence could save you losing your precious crypto.What other ways can cryptocurrency owners protect themselves from clipboard hijacking?

This is not a new problem for Ethereum, though. In fact, we reported back in July of last year that just two self-confessed pyramid schemes were the most popular DApps on Ethereum at the time.It seems that finding a consistent user base is more problematic than some people thought. A quick glance of the top 10 DApps on DappRadar at the moment shows that the most popular ones are with gamers.7 out of 10 of the highest performing DApps currently are in the gaming or gambling categories, with the other three being exchanges.

Furthermore, he suggested that these people would not start paying attention again until the price returns to tens of thousands.For most people, if they don\u2019t pay attention to Bitcoin now, they won\u2019t pay much attention to most of the time, so for them, only how many tens of thousands of bitcoins will break them will be noticed again.

Incidentally, back in November 2018, Dong predicted a bitcoin price of $50,000 by 2021, on microblogging site, Weibo.He explained his rationale for investing, and why to buy in a bear market, thus:In the bull market, I don\u2019t persuade people to buy Bitcoin, because it seems easy to make quick money but in fact it is not. Now [in the bear market], I start to talk people into buying Bitcoin.It Was The Best Of Times, It Was The Worst Of TimesBack to 2019, Dong cautioned not to be too optimistic or pessimistic, saying that more companies and projects would die. However, he went on to say that some hope will be born of it because the next wave of projects will emerge from this period.This, he said, would make 2019 both the best time and the worst time for entrepreneurs and investors. Despite the deaths of more companies and projects, good projects are cheaper to invest in.

Which doesn\u2019t leave much space to move in the event of, say, the next financial crash. At least as far as cash is concerned. So the Intentional Monetary Fund (IMF) have been looking at solutions to make negative interest rates a viable option.Less Than ZeroRecessions require tough measures, which has historically resulted in around 3-6 percent cut from interest base rates. But with many nations still maintaining near-zero rates from the last financial crisis, that doesn\u2019t leave them much wiggle room.The problem, of course, is cash, which has a lower-bound interest rate of zero by design. A negative base rate would necessitate commercial banks to either compress their margins or charge interest on deposits. And charging negative interest on deposits would likely cause a mass withdrawal of cash.The IMF notes that:\u2026instead of paying negative interest, one can simply hold cash at zero interest. Cash is a free option on zero interest, and acts as an interest rate floor.So why don\u2019t we just get rid of cash?Cashless SocietyA cashless society would not be limited by a lower bound on interest rates of zero percent. Central banks could reduce the rate to a negative figure, forcing consumers to pay interest on deposits. This would encourage investing or simply spending money as a preferable option, boosting the economy.But if cash exists then this cannot happen. People would simply hold cash at zero percent interest rather than paying for bank deposits in safes and mattresses.Interestingly, countries such as largely-cashless Sweden have already pushed rates slightly below zero. The inconvenience and expense of taking out and holding large amounts of cash has deterred most depositors from doing so.But cash still plays a significant role for payments in many countries such as Japan, Switzerland and Hungary. People kinda like the \u2018P2p\u2019 (person-to-person) nature of it.Hard ForkThe solution proposed by the IMF would be to enact a divorce between cash and electronic money, creating two separate currencies. In doing this, a central bank could make cash as costly as a bank deposit with a negative interest rate.Sounds great, doesn\u2019t it? How can we make cash more costly? But it\u2019s all to maintain the inflation target at all costs, according to the IMF. An excerpt reads:While a dual currency system challenges our preconceptions about money, countries could implement the idea with relatively small changes to central bank operating frameworks. In comparison to alternative proposals, it would have the advantage of completely freeing monetary policy from the zero lower bound. Its introduction would reconfirm the central bank\u2019s commitment to the inflation target, rather than raise doubts about it.Anyway, the electronic currency (e-money) would pay the policy rate of interest (either positive or negative). Then cash would have an exchange rate to the e-money. In times of negative interest, the cash exchange rate would depreciate at the same rate as the negative interest.Prices would be advertised separately in e-money and cash, so in terms of goods or e-money, there is no benefit to holding cash.\u201cThis dual local currency system would allow the central bank to implement as negative an interest rate as necessary for countering a recession, without triggering any large-scale substitutions into cash,\u201d the post reads.Or you could always take your suitcase full of cash to a shady geezer you met on LocalBitcoins, and swap it for some shiny inflation-free Bitcoin.Seriously. When the banks cause another financial crash, then tell us that they want to make all our money worthless. At that point, will anyone still have any faith at all left in the banking system?It\u2019s no wonder IMF\u2019svery own head, Christine Lagarde, thinks fintech will \u201cshake the financial system.\u201dWill central banks succeed in phasing out physical cash in the next 10 years?

Meanwhile, the country\u2019s government has issued new regulations that impose fees on Bitcoin remittance.2,545 BTC: New Weekly Bitcoin Trading Record According to data from Coin Dance, Venezuelans traded 2,454 BTC via Localbitcoins (the P2P trading platform) for the week ending February 9, 2018. This figure surpasses the 2,004 BTC recorded in the previous week.Last week\u2019s volume amounts to the highest ever recorded in the country. In terms of VES, the country\u2019s beleaguered fiat currency, 24 billion VES worth of Bitcoin changed hands during the period, an increase of 41 percent from the week ending February 2, 2019.With the continued political, social, economic turmoil in the Latin American state, citizens continue to rely on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for survival. The current stand-off in the political scene is sure to exacerbate further the already dire issues surrounding forex shortage and hyperinflation.15 Percent Fee on Bitcoin RemittanceWith Bitcoin trading volume soaring, state officials are getting into the action, introducing exorbitant fees on cryptocurrency remittance payments in the country.According to the notice published on the Official Gazette 41581 on February 7, 2019, the National Superintendence of Cryptoactives and Related Activities of Venezuela (SUNACRIP) now oversees cryptocurrency-based remittance in the country.#Ent\u00e9rate || PUBLICADA en Gaceta Oficial Nro 41581, Providencia mediante la cual se establecen los requisitos y tr\u00e1mites para el env\u00edo y recepci\u00f3n de remesas en Criptoactivos a personas naturales en el territorio de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela.#PetroMilagroEcon\u00f3mico pic.twitter.com/aaAqfiHAlW\u2014 Superintendencia Nacional de Criptoactivos (@SunacripVe) February 9, 2019SUNACRIP now has the power to set limits on cryptocurrency payments. An excerpt of the decree published by local crypto news media Criptonoticias, reads as follows:The ruling defines commissions that range from 0.25 euros ($0.28) as the minimum rate per transaction, to 15% of the funds transferred in cryptocurrencies [sic]. In addition, it limits the sending of remittances to a monthly amount equivalent to 10 Petros (PTR), a cryptocurrency [sic] created by the Venezuelan Government.The notice also establishes an upper limit for the cryptocurrency payments pegged at $3,000.The reaction from many commentators on the matter has been unanimously negative. Imposing fees on cryptocurrency remittance is counterproductive to the essence of international payments via cryptocurrency which is the removal of exorbitant fees charged by mainstream services.According to the World Bank, the global average remittance fees range between 5.2 percent and 9.4 percent. The SUNACRIP fee structure effectively renders crypto remittance more expensive than fiat.This new directive comes on the heels of an earlier law that seeks to punish what the state considers unauthorized cryptocurrency use.What\u2019s your take on the remittance fees being imposed on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions by the Venezuelan state?

This development marks the first ever involvement of U.S. pension funds in the virtual currency investment space.Pension Funds Anchor $40M Cryptocurrency InvestmentMorgan Creek Digital announced on Tuesday (February 12, 2019) the launch of a $40 million cryptocurrency venture fund anchored by two public pension funds.According to the announcement, the Fairfax County Employee\u2019s and Fairfax County Police Pension Plans are the two largest investors in the fund.Both pensions manage an asset portfolio worth about $1.2 billion. They are also the first ever public retirement fund to invest in cryptocurrencies, a notable milestone for the burgeoning industry.Speaking to Bloomberg, Morgan Creek Digital founder, Anthony Pompliano revealed that the fund would invest in blockchain startups and cryptocurrencies. Already, the new fund has investments in notable companies like Bakkt and Coinbase.Currently, there is no public disclosure of the investment terms, but Pompliano did indicate that the fund is a special purpose vehicle (SPV). Also, reports suggest that apart from equity investments in crypto-based companies, the fund will retain a portion of its value in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin 00.Institutions \u2018Already Here\u2019Many crypto critics usually never fail to bring up the absence of public pension funds in the virtual currency investment arena.

Usually, critics attribute the reticence of pension funds in investing in cryptocurrency to issues related to manipulation, volatility, lack of security, among others.In late 2018, the Morgan Creek Digital partner called on public pension funds to pivot towards the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology market. According to Pompliano, cryptos could serve as a viable hedge for such funds against what he called an \u201cimpending US pension crisis.\u201dFor Pompliano, the news is a massive win for cryptocurrency, saying \u201cthe institutions aren\u2019t coming. They\u2019re already here.\u201dDuring the interview with Bloomberg, the Morgan Creek Digital founder also said:There\u2019s a belief in the institutional world that if the industry will be around for a long time, it will be very valuable. The smart money is not distracted by price but looks at the long-term trends, and believes they\u2019re betting on innovation as a great way to deliver risk-mitigated returns.Do you think this development will vastly enhance the pedigree of cryptocurrencies in the eyes of other reticent mainstream investors?

Biggest Average Bitcoin Block Size to DateThe latest data from Blockchain.com shows that February 12, 2019 saw an average block size of 1.305 megabytes, the biggest on record.In fact, the blocks mined (approximately every 10 minutes) today by the Bitcoin network are now regularly bigger than 1MB. This was the previous limit that existed before Segregated Witness (SegWit) was introduced in August of 2017.With the introduction of SegWit, however, the concept of \u2018block size\u2019 has been replaced by \u2018block weight\u2019 allowing up to 4MB of capacity. Around 40 percent of all Bitcoin transactions today use SegWit. What\u2019s more, SegWit opened the possibility for off-chain scaling solutions such as the Lightning Network (LN), which has been growing at a rapid pace.Transactions or Spam?But the noticable uptick in block weight may not be due to more people paying for coffee with BTC.One of the biggest contributors of all transactions in recent months \u2014 as much as 20 percent \u2014 has been VeriBlock. This startup uses Bitcoin\u2019s OP_RETURN outputs to embed additional data for their \u2018proof-of-proof\u2019 miners.VeriBlock miners posted 783,000 transactions to Bitcoin's blockchain in December and are on track for 1,500,000 in January. https://t.co/CdIflq8Htu\u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) January 5, 2019VeriBlock\u2019s large share of blockchain data in such a short-time has indeed rekindled the \u2018transactions or spam\u2019 debate.\u201cI think if it pays the fee it\u2019s not spam,\u201d says developer Riccardo Casatta.However, VeriBlock made about 1 million bitcoin tx with op_return from the 1st of December 2018, they call Proof of Proof but is it more Proof of Spam? Why more than one tx per block?But others, like Casa CTO Jameson Lopp, are questioning whether VeriBlock can even sustain their seemingly \u201cinefficient\u201d activity in the long run. Particularly, if transaction fees do not stay at record low levels. He said:Source of the now-highest volume of OP_RETURN outputs has been identified as VeriBlock \u201cproof of proof\u201d miners. They are creating around 20% of all BTC transactions now. Seems inefficient to me; will be interesting to see if the incentives work long term.But regardless of who\u2019s paying for the transactions, mining larger blocks while transaction fees are at record lows shows that Bitcoin is, in fact, scaling towards greater adoption. Last month, Bitcoinist reported that daily on-chain transaction volume has recovered to a yearly high of over 300,000.

If you\u2019re looking for friendly pastures for your cryptocurrency company, avoid these three states at all costs.1. New YorkNew York has consistently hit the top of the list for its unsympathetic Bitcoin regulation. Its infamous BitLicense has been called out as \u201cregulatory overreach\u201d by many a key figure in the industry. These include ShapeShift\u2019s Erik Voorhees and Kraken\u2019s Jesse Powell. Speaking at Consensus in New York last year, Voorhees stated:Here we are two miles from the Statue of Liberty and you cannot sell CryptoKitties in the state without that license. That\u2019s the absurdity of what\u2019s happened here.Powell meanwhile spoke out against the former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. He sent Kraken a request for customer information a full three years after the exchange had stopped doing business in New York.New York\u2019s BitLicence has forced many a crypto company out of the state, highlighting the fact that regulation at a federal level is needed. Under the stipulations of BitLicence, exchanges have to disclose all information about their entire global client base. This is something not only abhorrent to most customers but also potentially illegal. Other countries have different privacy laws from the United States.However, a change may be on the horizon. New York\u2019s Governor Andrew Cuomo recently signed a digital currency study bill creating the first cryptocurrency task force in the US. This will comprise technology and blockchain experts, as well as investors and researchers. The task force\u2019s goal is to promote a healthier cryptocurrency economy while protecting New York investors. Time will tell if it\u2019s a success or yet another case of regulation on steroids.2. Rhode IslandRhode Island recently earned a place on this list as one of the worst states for Bitcoin regulation. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse labeled cryptocurrencies as an easy way for \u201cforeign interference\u201d in American elections. He also laid out new tax regulations for virtual currencies.The new Rhode Island Senate Bill No. 251 is called \u201cAn act relating to taxation \u2014 sale and use tax\u2013non-collecting retailers, referrers, and retail sale facilitators act.\u201d Apparently, the intention of the bill is to:Assess sales tax on marketplace facilitations, including those that provide cryptocurrencies used by buyers to pay for services.In other words? Make doing business a whole lot harder for blockchain businesses in the state. Wall Street veteran and cryptocurrency supporter Caitlin Long was quick to criticize on Twitter. She said that companies should just leave states that prevent blockchain innovation and strangle research and development:ARE YOU KIDDING?? Check out #RhodeIsland #crypto tax proposal\u2014it\u2019s so broad that it includes taxing software development + R&D. Get out of states that show by actions they don\u2019t want #blockchain cos & come to #Wyoming where we do! @Tyler_Lindholm @SenatorDriskill @GordonGovernor https://t.co/We4n3hNkIx\u2014 Caitlin Long \ud83d\udd11 (@CaitlinLong_) February 10, 2019Long has made headlines lately by helping the Wyoming state to set out clear regulations that welcome and attract blockchain companies. Wyoming has even introduced bills to support cryptocurrencies as legal tender.This is far from the backward, draconian case of Rhode Island that still associates cryptocurrencies with criminal activity\u2013and Russia.3. ArizonaAnother newcomer to this list, blockchain attorney Drew Hinkes posted yesterday that Arizona had just become the next hostile state when it comes to Bitcoin regulation. Arizona is proposing a bill that imposes sales tax on marketplace facilitators that accept or require virtual currencies, following the lead from Rhode Island.#Arizona, come on down! You're the next state to propose a bill to impose sales tax on marketplace facilitators who require/allow #virtualcurrencies to be used by purchasers to buy products from sellers.

They Won\u2019t \u201cRush In on Day One\u201dSpeaking on Bloomberg Daybreak: Middle East, the CEO at Galaxy Digital laid out his current position on Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market.Novogratz acknowledged the tumultuous nature of 2018 for the cryptocurrency market, as a lot of the digital currencies have collapsed in value with more than 90 percent, while the market itself has lost upwards of $700 billion.However, he also remains firm on his feet, holding that recovery will follow.He said that all the \u201cretail friends that came up and down are washed out\u201d and that the market is in the process of \u201chanding off ownership from retail to institutions.\u201dThe expert outlines that all the architecture which institutions need to \u201cfeel comfortable\u201d is currently being put in place.Namely, Novogratz noted Bakkt and Fidelity as important steps in providing trusted custody solutions, saying that they are likely to come in somewhere next month.However, he also holds that institutions won\u2019t \u201crush in on day one\u201d but they would rather take their time and see some \u201cwater run through the pipes.\u201dNevertheless, Novogratz predicts that institutions will allocate a small amount of their assets into the cryptocurrency market over the next 6 to 12 months while clarifying that \u201ca small amount of institutional assets is a lot of money.\u201dBitcoin Will Be \u2018Digital Gold\u2019Commenting on Bitcoin, Novogratz said that the cryptocurrency \u201cis going to be digital gold.\u201d He outlined that it will be a place where \u201cyou have sovereign money.\u201dIt\u2019s not US money, it\u2019s not Chinese money, it\u2019s sovereign. And so sovereignty, it costs a lot. It should cost a lot.Novogratz has said that bitcoin will become \u201cdigital gold\u201d before. In December 2018, he said:I do believe Bitcoin is going to be digital gold. That means it\u2019s the only one of the coins out there that gets to be a legal pyramid scheme. Just like gold is.But he\u2019s also not the only one to compare Bitcoin to the precious metal. In fact, some proponents like Digital Currency Group\u2019s Barry Silbert have argued that Bitcoin is \u201950 times more useful\u2019 than gold.The popular Bitcoin investors, owners of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, have also said that Bitcoin is better than gold.Do you think institutional money is coming to the cryptocurrency market?

That looks like this: $22,000,000,000,000.This may seem like a distant number and it\u2019s certainly easy for us to get detached but let me remind you that just about every pension and investment fund in the world holds a large amount of US treasuries. So, we\u2019re all in this big boat together.Of course, with the high level of inflation over the last few decades, it\u2019s important to put this large round figure into a more tangible context. After all, 22 trillion is just a round number. A large round number but still rather arbitrary.The best way to understand the national debt is by checking the debt to GDP ratio. In other words how much is the US producing compared to what it owes?In the following graph, we can see American debt to GDP over the last 50 years. Bloomberg\u2019s Hilary Clark @queenofchartz who produced the graph has admitted that it is the scariest chart she\u2019s ever made.It\u2019s probably nothing to worry about though. As long as the United States is able to continue making the necessary payments on its debt, the global economy should remain stable. And to be fair, there are certainly other countries with far higher levels of debt.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsDays to next Shutdown: 2 | Days to Brexit: 44Emerging Getting CrowdedCrypto Has Asymmetric RiskPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of February 13th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsVolatility continues to slide as stocks continue to soar. Optimism is high that the tentative deal to avert a US government shutdown will be grudgingly confirmed by President Trump and that the March 1st deadline to complete a US-China trade deal will be extended.It\u2019s also been confirmed that President Xi himself will be meeting with US officials in Beijing on Friday to try and hammer out a deal.On the Brexit front, it seems increasingly likely that this uncertainty is gonna come down to the wire. In an odd headline this morning, it seems that May\u2019s hand may have been tipped\u2026Guess that goes to show that alcohol and Brexit don\u2019t mix. In any case, the alleged conversation has May\u2019s Chief EU advisor Olly Robins saying that when it comes down to it, UK parliament will be given a choice between May\u2019s deal at the last minute or an extension from the EU to Article 50.The chance of a no-deal Brexit remains low and many analysts seem to be putting it at about a 10% probability, which is still much higher than zero than it probably should be.Keep an eye out for the US CPI inflation figures coming out an hour before Wall Street\u2019s opening bell today.Emerging Crowded TradeAccording to a fund manager survey in February, the new most crowded trade at the moment is \u2018long emerging markets.\u2019The title was stolen from \u2018long US Dollar\u2019, which held the crown for two months, and was preceded by the \u2018long Faang\u2019 position, which managed to remain the most crowded trade for ten consecutive months.This play is one that we highlighted in our annual outlook webcast (timestamp: 36:48) on January 8th. The Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary tightening in 2018 was putting a choke hold on emerging market economies, which tend to hold a large amount of US Dollar denominated debt. Now that they\u2019ve shifted to a more neutral stance, traders are piling into EEM.What\u2019s interesting to note is the sentiment of the survey\u2019s participants. Even though it\u2019s the most crowded trade, only 18% actually think that it\u2019s overvalued at the moment.Crypto\u2019s Asymmetrical RiskWe highlighted some breaking news yesterday about a $40 million investment into crypto by two large public pension funds, but this small bit of news is so fantastic that I\u2019d like to talk about it again today.One of the things that jumped out at me was something Katherine Molnar said\u2026You see, the two Fairfax funds involved in this investment have a combined $5.7 billion under management. So the $40 million they\u2019ve put into crypto is only 0.7% of that. This is good money management at play.Should the crypto market see another year like 2018 with an 80% drawdown, the fund will only lose 0.56% of its total portfolio. As long as the rest of the portfolio performs properly, nobody will even notice the hit.If crypto has a fantastic year as it did in 2017 and rises by 1000%, their overall portfolio will rise by 7%. This is what we call asymmetric risk, where the risk to the upside far outweighs the downside risk.Note: For the purpose of simplicity in this analogy, I\u2019ve lumped both Fairfax County funds into one even though they are separate funds.Traders and investors are always looking for an advantageous risk/reward ratio and now that we\u2019ve already seen a large retracement in the crypto market, the ratio is becoming very attractive. Now that Fairfax County has opened the door, it will be interesting to see if other traditional fund managers join in.Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalysteToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

Also, data from Bitcoin directory service platform, Coinmap shows that businesses accepting Bitcoin have surged by more than 700 percent within the last six years.Online Retailers Accepting BitcoinAccording to a survey by Kaspersky Labs, about 13 percent of people have used cryptocurrency as a payment method. The study collected responses from more than 12,000 consumers in 22 different countries.The results of the survey show that crypto use is still the least popular method with 81 percent of respondents saying they used credit/debit cards for online purchases. However, the implication of having 13 percent of people across multiple countries using Bitcoin is profound from an adoption point of view.Commenting on results, Vitaly Mzokov of Kaspersky Lab said:Despite a fall in cryptocurrency prices, there is still a strong desire for digital transactions amongst consumers. Our consumer research has found that 13% of people have used cryptocurrency as a payment method, which was surprising to see.Cryptocurrency prices fell by more than 80 percent in 2018. However, a fraction of internet shoppers seem to have no problems using virtual currencies. More importantly, online retail outlets aren\u2019t shying away from accepting cryptos.These results also counter the mainstream narrative that cryptos fund no utility in the online retail arena. Critics like JPMorgan would have people believe that merchants aren\u2019t accepting BTC and crypto\u2019s only appeal comes via risky speculative investments.Bitcoin Acceptance Continues to GrowConcerning the pace of BTC acceptance, data from Coinmap shows that businesses that accept Bitcoin across the globe have increased by 702 percent since December 2013.According to Coinmap, there are now 14,346 venues that accept BTC as against 1,789 recorded almost six years ago.Coinshares CEO, Ryan Radloff, showed this massive increase in BTC acceptance over the past five years in a tweet posted on Tuesday (February 12, 2019).

Can you guess which one? As suggested by a report from Bloomberg, XBT CEO Laurent Kssis \u201cdidn\u2019t have a clue\u201d about the potential for a Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork \u2014 which happened late last year \u2014 despite getting the green light from Swedish regulators to launch a cryptocurrency ETP. He told the privately held financial, software, data, and media company:It\u2019s important to ask how the community is responding to the split and who\u2019s going to support one asset versus the other. If we get it wrong, these assets will drop and if they\u2019re part of the basket we can\u2019t go back because it\u2019s in the final term-sheet.Though Kssis never explicitly mentions Bitcoin Cash as the culprit, one can put two and two together. The altcoin experienced a high-profile ideological split in Q4 2018 when the community took sides between Bitcoin Cash Satoshi\u2019s Vision (SV) and Bitcoin Cash ABC.The confusion was largely blamed for pushing the price of Bitcoin (BTC) down below yearly support in dramatic fashion \u2014 though one might argue that it was heading down anyway.Commenting on XBT\u2019s retraction of the ETP, Bloomberg strategist Mike McGlone stated:Hard forks are indicative of some of the primary issues in cryptos pressuring prices. The overall issue is rapidly increasing crypto supply and negative signals for potential institutional investors of how still nascent the market is.In even simpler terms, McGlone\u2019s statement could be interpreted as one which claims investors outside of the cryptocurrency industry have no idea why there are so many \u201cBitcoins\u201d in the first place.It\u2019s not an easy task to explain to someone how Bitcoin Cash was originally created because some people in the community thought it was more in line with Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s real vision for peer-to-peer electronic cash, but then that sub-community had an apparent disagreement over what Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s real vision for peer-to-peer electronic cash actually was \u2014 and that one of those people actually claims he is (or \u201cwas\u201d) Satoshi Nakamoto.At the end of the day, if you don\u2019t know enough about cryptocurrencies to know that Bitcoin Cash might hardfork at an all-but-planned date, you probably shouldn\u2019t be offering it in a basket of digital assets to institutional investors.What do you think about XBT\u2019s putting the breaks on its cryptocurrency ETP?

He said that \u201cas far as I\u2019m concerned bitcoin has won the race to be digital gold.\u201dYounger investors don\u2019t hold gold in the same hallowed view as their parents. $30 trillion of baby-boomer wealth is due to be passed on over the next two decades.

This now looks as though it could be coming to a conclusion.Bitcoin Price: 4-Hour ChartLooking at the 4-hour chart, it reveals that Bitcoin price 00 has been attempting to form a bullish flag, which would imply that a run to $4,000 would be possible if there was a volumous breakout above $3600.In a bull market, we would typically expect the bulls to hold the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, which is now under assault, with the MAC-D also turning bearish suggesting that the bulls are losing steam.The VPVR, which illustrates the volume being traded at a given price (within a given range), shows that unless the bulls can hold $3520. It is likely we will get a fast move into the $3400 range, where the 61.8% and 78.6% Fibonacci retracement levels lie. These typically interest those who have previously secured profits.1-DayThe 1-day chart shows us that the impulsive bullish move has been capped by the declining resistance, which dates back to the bounce over Christmas during 2018.The 200-week movin average has provided strong support to date and is quickly beginning to catch up with price and the overhead declining diagonal resistance.This pinch point is looking increasingly likely to become an point of inflection in this market that will ultimately dictate price action for many weeks to come.However, this could take until the end of March to play out as there is little selling interest in the low $3,000s and little buying interest as we move towards $4,000. In short, something will have to give through time.Macro ChartLooking at the macro chart for clues, it is clear that there is an uncanny resemblance between 2015 and 2018 with just over 60 weeks to go before the block reward halvening.The 200-week MA is acting as support. The 50 and 100-week moving averages are about to cross and the logarithmic line of regression is passing through the 100 and 50 MA convergence, shortly after the price has been scythed in half.You may be forgiven for thinking that exactly the same scenario is being played out, but the main difference is that there has not been a significant bump in the volume and bounce in the price when the 200-week MA was tested. This has led some to doubt that the bottom has been found as in 2015. But as we mentioned earlier, we are likely to find out in due course.Trade Bitcoin, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

Is there more upside for the altcoin in the immediate future? After leading the marketwide charge late last week, the price of Litecoin (LTC) has cooled off and is looking set for another move. Odds are, that move will be to the upside \u2014 at least against Bitcoin (BTC).Daily Exponential Moving AveragesLitecoin\u2019s three exponential moving averages (EMA) are looking rather bullish against its big brother, Bitcoin.The 50-day EMA has crossed over both the 100-day and 200-day EMAs, suggesting the popular altcoin is ready to undergo a full-fledged trend reversal.200-Week Moving AverageAdding additional support to that theory is the 200-week simple moving average (MA), as shown below:Litecoin\u2019s break above the 200-week MA last week was indeed bullish.It will be even more bullish if the price can remain above the long-term indicator, which is useful for identifying when a digital asset is in a bearish trend or a bullish trend.Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI)The Stochastic Relative Strength Index for LTCBTC is also suggesting that the \u2018silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold\u2019 is cooling off after being overbought following the announcement of confidential transactions possibly coming to the LTC blockchain in the future.The indicator is heading down towards oversold territory while price remains relatively stable. Those looking to long Litecoin or accumulate before the altcoin\u2019s block reward halving on Aug 8 may be encouraged to do so when the Stochastic RSI reaches oversold territory \u2014 depending on market conditions at the time, of course.Litecoin\u2019s dollar valuation will, naturally, depend largely on Bitcoin\u2019s price movement in the coming days and weeks. That said, with fundamental developments and a halving on the not-so-distant horizon, betting against BTC may be a solid bet in the medium term.What do you think of the Litecoin price?

Consequently, cryptocurrency exchanges in the country now have a set of requirements that must be satisfied before being allowed to operate.Requirements for Bitcoin Exchanges in IndonesiaThe Indonesian Trade Ministry Futures Exchange Supervisory Board (Bappebti) issued regulation No.5/2019 which includes regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as, a formal recognition of cryptocurrencies as commodities. Based on the new ruling, virtual currency trading is now legalized in the country.As part of the new set of laws, Bitcoin exchanges must employ the services of IT security experts and keep records of their transactions for a minimum of five years. Also, one of their servers must be domiciled in the country and they must have clearly defined organizational structures with departments like legal, audit, client support, IT, etc.Speaking to Hukumonline, Bappebti chief, Indrasari Wisnu Wardhana, highlighted the need for these regulations saying:We want to give protection to people who want to invest in crypto assets so that they aren\u2019t cheated by fraudulent sellers.These regulations form part of a larger set of rules for cryptocurrency commodity trading both in the spot and futures trading market.On Thursday, (February 14, 2019), Bitcoinist reported that traders in the country were protesting the excessive paid-up capital restrictions imposed on cryptocurrency futures trading. Cryptocurrency Payments Still ProhibitedWhile these new laws provide legal certainty for cryptocurrency exchanges, such services have been operational in the country since as early as 2014. Despite the formal recognition given to virtual currencies as commodities, the ban on cryptocurrency payment is still in effect.Onny Widjanarko, a top executive of Indonesia\u2019s apex bank (BI) said that the bank was part of the deliberations that led to the recognition of cryptos as commodities. For Widjanarko, the decision by Bappebti does not negate its ruling against cryptocurrencies as its mandate is the protection of rupiah sovereignty and monopoly within the country.Speaking to CNBC Indonesia on Friday (February 15, 2019), Widjanarko said:BI still prohibits bitcoin or crypto as a means of payment.

It would be tied to the US dollar, he added, and exchangeable for cash within the ecosystems it serves.Reacting to the reveal, however, others were less than impressed. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of payment network Ripple, likened JPM Coin to previous plans from banks elsewhere, arguing it was a case of \u2018too little, too late\u2019 in the age of public blockchains.\u201c\u2026 [T]his JPM project misses the point \u2013 introducing a closed network today is like launching AOL after Netscape\u2019s IPO,\u201d he added in social media comments.Garlinghouse has faced skepticism of his own over the past year amid centralization concerns that continue to swirl around Ripple and its associated cryptocurrency, XRP. Not A Cryptocurrency?Continuing on JPM Coin meanwhile, Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, said the industry shouldn\u2019t call it a cryptocurrency at all.\u201cIt\u2019s not a cryptocurrency,\u201d he told MarketWatch. A cryptocurrency is one that is open and permissionless, if you want to download it, you don\u2019t need permission; you just need some software.Others went beyond definitions, arguing JPMorgan would help cryptocurrency gain wider publicity.\u201cThey\u2019ve finally figured out there\u2019s a lot of money to be made in this business,\u201d Bubba Trading strategist Todd Horwitz added to CNBC Thursday.Bitcoin pioneer, Nick Szabo, meanwhile likened JPM Coin to Venezuela\u2019s virtual currency, the Petro, pointing out that both require trust, thus deafeating the entire purpose of using a blockchain.Correct.

However, most of the online crypto lotteries face a barrage of different hurdles, ranging from a complete lack of transparency of the drawing processes and questionable auditing practices. GG World Lottery is different. Placing all cards on the table, the project brings unparalleled verifiability and certified trust.Existing Problems and the Need to OvercomeThe majority of countries currently run private or government-backed lotteries. These continue to grow in popularity, especially in emerging markets. One visible trend, however, is that the majority of legacy lotteries see stagnation or even a drop in their revenues as they fail to adopt emerging technologies.Mature lotteries introduce new products regularly, which should, in theory, bring diversification and further user engagement. In reality, however, they face a fairly disturbing trend, which is more of a demographic one \u2013 millennials are purchasing tickets at a visibly lower rate compared to previous generations.This is because legacy lotteries, in their majority, fail to adopt new technologies. Millennials are relying more on their mobile devices and technology to be informed and engaged, while legacy lotteries are very slow to react.Additionally, there\u2019s a notable concern regarding the lack of clear and transparent auditability, verifiability, and overall trust within different aspects of the lottery industry. This problem is particularly emphasized when it comes to the drawing process.What\u2019s the Solution?GG World Lottery enters a market in a desperate need of disruption. In order to enhance existing solutions and provide a fresh perspective for the growing base of lottery players, the project undertakes a modern approach.GG World Lotteries are entirely online and mobile-friendly. This allows users to purchase tickets and to access the lotteries regardless of their current location. More importantly, it takes away the need to visit any physical lottery ticket-selling venues, which is what millennials struggle with.In addition, all the lotteries run by GG International are government-regulated in the countries they operate. This guarantees compliance, security, and regulatory oversight to further ensure the player\u2019s peace of mind.Certified TrustIn a more recent development, GG International acquired a certification from Global Laboratories International (GLI).The latter is an independent entity, accredited through ISO 17025:2005 and ISO 17065:2012. It works to verify the technical compliance of third parties and makes sure they adhere to the highest industry standards. GLI is trusted by 475 jurisdictions spread across the world.The fact that GG International, the company behind GG World Lotteries, acquired the certificate means that the games run on their platform are safe not only for the player but for the operator as well.The document signals that the True Random Number Generator used by GG World is a reliable technology which guarantees the fairness of the draws and that they happen as per the quantum physics principles for true randomness. The blockchain layer, on the other hand, upon which the TRNG is built, allows for complete and unparalleled transparency and verifiability of the processes.Three Weeks Until the End of the Public SaleWith about three weeks left until the end of the public sale, users still have a chance to participate in the GG World Project.This brings an array of perks. For once, each token holder will get to build up a passive string of income.This is possible because by becoming a token holder, the user is automatically entitled to a lifetime revenue share based on each Jackpot ever won on GG World Lotteries. Put simply, when someone wins the Jackpot, every token holder will receive his share. The dividends are paid quarterly and the more tokens one holds, the larger his piece of the distribution will be.You can find out more about the project and take part in the security token offering on the official website.You can also stay tuned on the project\u2019s Facebook and Twitter page or join the live Telegram group if you have any questions.What do you think about GG World Lottery?

Now Iranian authorities have launched PayMon cryptocurrency supposedly backed by national gold reserves. Except, it\u2019s not really cryptocurrency after all since there\u2019s nothing peer-to-peer about it and you still need to trust an intermediary (i.e. the Iranian government).PayMon Has All the Traits of a Classic ShitcoinSputnik caught up with Iranian blockchain specialist Hamid Reza Shaabani, to find out about the features of PayMon and what its potential uses are. The specific details are pretty wooly but it does seem to smell a lot like a shitcoin. Shaabani said:Much of the PayMon currency will enter the market and will be traded in special exchange offices. Some of it will be used for the development of hosts; and some of it will go to the founders of Ghoghnoos.When asked why cryptocurrency is so important for Iran, Shaabani waxed lyrical about the nation\u2019s excellent geographical position, the people\u2019s interest, and, of course, the fact that:Bypassing economic sanctions is one of those cases that cannot be ignored.Using Cryptocurrency to Bypass U.S. SanctionsIran has already been in talks about the possibility of a workaround for U.S. sanctions with several trading partners. These include England, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Russia, among others.However, since France and England are little more than the USA\u2019s lapdogs, it seems extremely unlikely that Iran\u2019s PayMon will find a taker. It\u2019s highly doubtful that even Germany would accept a crypto rial after they bowed to U.S. pressure back in July preventing Iran from withdrawing funds from German banks. As Shaabani acknowledged, when it comes to acceptance: it all depends on foreign legislative bodies.Users of PayMon have to undergo KYC, which means that the \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 itself is centralized. While it\u2019s supposedly backed by gold, just like Venezuela\u2019s Petro is supposedly backed by oil, one must still trust that the said gold bars are actually there.What Happened to Petro Gold?In fact, Iran is not the first country to explore a cryptocurrency backed by gold. Venezuela was looking into the Petro Gold around this time last year, although progress on that seems to have halted. It\u2019s unlikely that Maduro will find many people to trust his oil or gold-backed currencies. In Iran\u2019s case, though, the gold may actually be there since the country had been squirreling it away for months before the sanctions.A few glaring issues remain, however. It\u2019s not trustless. It\u2019s not peer-to-peer, or even really cryptocurrency if the network has a few nodes operated by the government. So it\u2019s doubtful that it will have any takers.Is Iran\u2019s \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 capable of bypassing economic sanctions?

Part of a quest to expand the Post\u2019s business scope, cryptocurrency sales follow on from the extant fiat exchange service currently available in branches across the country.

Last year, even its banking sector came on board, with Bank Frick offering cryptocurrency purchases and cold storage facilities.Prior to that, the Crown Prince of Liechtenstein publicly expressed interest in investing in the industry. The Post\u2019s move marks the latest expansion success for Crypto Valley, the increasingly large community centered in the Swiss town of Zug.

Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsThe major disappointment came yesterday from the US retail sector, which made for dismal reading.The reaction from the stock markets was swift and brutal as the major indices, which have been on a tear since the December lows took a noticeable hit (purple circle). The fall is not so dramatic; of more concern is the lost opportunity on what could\u2019ve happened had the report been fine.The market was setting up as if to rise but now the rally could possibly be called into question. We\u2019ll see.After all, poor economic data has largely been interpreted by investors as good news for the last few years. The worse the data, the more likely the Fed is to prop up the markets with additional stimulus.Even as I\u2019m writing we can see the European session turning from red to green.JPM Coin\u2026As the news was spreading fast across the interwebs, I already had a drink in my hand, getting ready for a show called \u201cBlockchain on Booze.\u201d The drunken panel, myself included, decided to discuss the big news from JPM right out the gate. Hope you enjoy the show.On the face of it, though they\u2019re calling it a \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d this new coin seems to have very little to do with the crypto market. With estimated daily transfers of $6 trillion, the bank was about due for a systems upgrade and after all, why not use a private distributed ledger system to streamline things for them and their clients?There have been several articles saying that this news is bad for Ripple as it could eat into their core market. One article even claimed that JPM coin has killed the Bitcoin dream, but nothing could be further from the truth.Especially in a nascent industry, having competition is good for business. In fact, the atmosphere among the XRP community was one of celebration more than anything.Still, as we\u2019ve seen many times over the last few years, the news, good or bad, doesn\u2019t always impact prices. As we can see, prices barely budged yesterday.Bigger Crypto FishYesterday we were all celebrating the achievement of Anthony Pompliano and Morgan Creek, who managed to onboard the first known public pension fund into a bit of crypto exposure, a great achievement no doubt. Several hours later, crypto investment firm Grayscale also released a stunning report.That\u2019s right, over the course of 2018, one of the worst years for crypto prices in history, institutional money has continued to flow in. To be fair, the fund did perform a lot better at the beginning of the year before sentiment turned really sour, but as we can see, there were continuous flows in throughout the year.Also notable is that 88% of the money was invested directly in their bitcoin product, yet another figure that shows BTC\u2018s clear dominance in the market.Wishing you and yours a fantastic weekend ahead.Best regards, Mati Greenspan Senior Market AnalysteToro (UK) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. eToro (Europe) Ltd is authorized and regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.This is a marketing communication and should not be taken as investment advice, personal recommendation, or an offer of, or solicitation to buy or sell, any financial instruments.

What\u2019s more, they are increasingly opting for Bitcoin over other altcoin offerings as the cryptocurrency market flatlines. A Challenging, Yet Record YearAccording to Grayscale\u2019s Q4 report, 2018 saw new investment at Grayscale hit a record high of $359.5 million; almost triple that of 2017\u2019s bull-run. However, quarter on quarter, inflows reduced over 60 percent on average to only $31.1 million in Q4.The breakdown of this figure shows that price falls and the general market slowdown, are changing the average investor profile. As Grayscale Managing Director, Michael Sonnenshein, explained:It was by no means our best quarter, but it\u2019s certainly important to recognize that despite the price declines investors were actively engaged.\u2018Return of the Bitcoin Maximalist\u2019Of this inflow, 88 percent came from bitcoin investment, and 12 percent from non-bitcoin investment.This is compared to 67 percent and 33 percent bitcoin to alts through 2018, suggesting that investors are increasingly going for Bitcoin as the bear market continues.Grayscale notes that a key takeaway from their Q4 data is that there is increasing appetite for their bitcoin product compared to other altcoins.Return of the Bitcoin Maximalist. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (f/k/a Bitcoin Investment Trust) stood out this quarter, attracting the most capital within the Grayscale family of products despite further price declines in the digital asset market. In the fourth quarter, 88% of inflows were into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, while 12% were into products tied to other digital assets.Saving For The Grey DollarIndividual investors can buy and hold Grayscale\u2019s flagship Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product via brokerage retirement accounts. This gives investors exposure to bitcoin price 00 movements without actually buying any, which is almost impossible through retirement vehicles normally.While such investors made up 15 percent of Grayscale\u2019s total inflows for 2018 ($53.9 million), this leapt to 40% when considering only Q4 (around $12 million).Institutional investors accounted for 50 percent of Q4 investment (66% over the whole of 2018), and family offices and accredited investors made up the rest.This indicates that average investors are using the bear market to invest for retirement, taking a long-term view on the prospects of BTC.Institutional HoldingsThe other indication from these results is that larger institutions are gradually building up their core strategic positions in the market.This is certainly echoed by Grayscale Founder, and CEO of (Grayscale parent company) Digital Currency Group, Barry Silbert. As Bitcoinist reported yesterday, Silbert is expecting 2019 to be a tipping point for institutional investment, and expects prices to \u201csnap back hard\u201d as soon as this happens.Grayscale is the largest cryptocurrency asset manager in the world, holding $793.6 million of client funds.Meanwhile, earlier this week saw the first investment into cryptocurrency of US public pension funds. Two funds representing public servants from Fairfax County, anchored a $40 million fund launched by Morgan Creek Digital.Why do you think retirement funds are tapping into Bitcoin?

Elsa Saikkonen | Feb 16, 2019 | 05:00 Share Tweet Send Share In case you didn\u2019t realize it during the brutal bear market of 2018, the days of stupid money flowing stupidly into any and every cryptocurrency-related project are over. Now, it\u2019s all about the maturity of the nascent market, and that means institutional investors \u2018need\u2019 to step in \u2014 a sentiment not lost on some startup companies. One such startup is Tagomi, a Jersey City-based company of under 20 people that offers a trading platform for institutional investors looking to throw around big bucks. As noted by Forbes, the company boasts an ex-global head of electronic trading at Goldman Sachs and a Harvard grad with experience at Union Square Ventures as founders, alongside a consulting/private equity/venture capitalism expert.Tagomi apparently works by providing institutional clients with easier onboarding into the world of cryptocurrencies by pooling liquidity from approximately 10 exchanges and finding the lowest prices via algorithms \u2014 for a commission of 0.10 percent to upwards of 0.25 percent per trade, of course. Co-CEO Greg Tusar explained:The current exchange model requires you to prefund your trade.

Many people speculate that smart money is still on the sidelines, but others insist that this belief is misguided. The world\u2019s most successful traders and investors buy the bottom and sell the top. To think that institutional investors are not currently playing the game might be foolish. (If they are, they are almost certainly on the short side until a true bottom for Bitcoin hits.)Tusar claimed:Current trading volumes underestimate what we see in terms of institutional interest.What do you think about Tagomi?

The hikes, which come into effect in April 2019, are likely to further damage already the fragile relationship between payment providers and merchants.Fees-Us ChristAccording to sources, the increases will firstly affect interchange fees, which merchants pay their banks when accepting a card transaction. Fees that the banks pay to Visa and Mastercard for processing payments will also increase, says the report.A spokesperson for Visa confirmed that fees would rise in April, but only for banks, not merchants. However, banks are not known for their benevolence, or for reducing profits by absorbing costs. So they are likely to pass on these fee increases to the merchants.Similarly, merchants exist to make a profit, so will have to weigh up whether to pass these costs on to the consumer.Bottom line \u2013 We\u2019re all getting stung.In The Name of SecurityThe card companies tend to justify their fees by claiming security measures must be enhanced to prevent fraud and theft. They also point out that merchants receive more sales if they accept card payments.But in Q4 2018, Visa\u2019s net income rose to $2.85 billion, an increase of 33% on results for Q4 the previous year. Similarly, Mastercards Q4 profits last year climbed to $1.9 billion, also a 33% jump on the $1.43 billion in Q4 2017.Perhaps the fees need to be raised to cover the $6.2 billion payout the two companies faced after losing a US anti-trust case? Although that money had supposedly already been set aside, the merchants are gearing up for round two.Or perhaps US fees need to be increased to offset reduced profits (not losses, never losses) in Europe, due to anti-trust investigations there?Bottom line \u2013 Visa and Mastercard are not to be trusted.The People Are RevoltingOr at least the people should be revolting. We are all being overcharged thanks to the hegemony of the big two payment processors.But there are alternatives\u2026 and they scare the crap out of Visa and Mastercard. That\u2019s why, despite a widespread denial in financial circles that Bitcoin is anything like cash, they both charge cash-advance fees for bitcoin purchases.And now that Visa and Mastercard are throwing their weight into political arguments, we should be demanding that our favored merchants accept cryptocurrency payments. After all, if accepting card payments increase overall sales then accepting bitcoin opens up a whole new market.And all efforts are going towards reducing fees for bitcoin and crypto transactions.Bottom line \u2013 We would all be better off using bitcoin.Can cryptocurrencies capitalize on Visa and Mastercard raising their fees?

The company forecasts an aggressive rebound for the 2020 fiscal year, but Wall Street analysts say such forecasts are overly optimistic given the lack of significant change in the market.Sale of Cryptocurrency Mining Chips PlummetThe U.S. gaming hardware maker released its full-year earnings report for the 2019 fiscal year (which ended on January 27, 2019) on Thursday. According to the report, the company\u2019s total revenue for the year stood at $11.72 billion, a 21 percent increase from the previous year.Despite the overall earnings growth, Nvidia reports an underwhelming Q4, with earnings down by more than 30 percent from Q3 figures. This decrease is largely due to a drop in demand for computer chips by cryptocurrency miners.For half of 2018, miners seemed relatively untouched by the prolonged bear market that gripped the rest of the cryptocurrency arena. However, by Q3 2018, it began to become apparent that miners were starting to fill the pinch.Back in May, Bitcoinist reported that they expected a 67 percent drop in the sale of graphics card used by cryptocurrency miners. The mid-November 2018 bitcoin price crash, which almost took BTC to nearly $3,000, also exacerbated the situation with many miners forced to turn off their rigs.Commenting on the Q4 performance, Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang, said:This was a turbulent close to what had been a great year. The combination of post-crypto excess channel inventory and recent deteriorating end-market conditions drove a disappointing quarter.Wall Street Says Future Rebound Remains UnlikelyTo reassure investors, Nvidia issued a forecast based on an aggressive rebound in demand, but Wall Street analysts don\u2019t share the same view. According to analysts like Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, the projections from Nvidia do not seem realistic.Speaking to Reuters, Munster opined that the predicted 35 percent growth in year-over-year revenue for the fiscal year 2020 assumes a boom akin to that of 2017 cryptocurrency market.With the U.S./China trade face-off still unresolved and no significant upward movement in the virtual currency market, analysts say demand from miners isn\u2019t expected to rise any time soon.Do you envisage any scenario where there will be a trend reversal in demand for cryptocurrency mining chips in 2019?

Now, digital exchange Huobi Global offers, as a trial, the HUSD Solution V2.0 to provide traders with support for interchangeability between various stablecoins.All Stablecoins Seek to Lower Volatility But They are Not 1:1 InterchangeableStablecoins\u2019 purpose is to minimize price volatility by being pegged to a fiat currency or an exchange-traded commodity, such as a precious or industrial metal.The HUSD Solution V2.0 offers support for interchangeability between four stablecoins: Gemini Dollars (GUSD), Paxos Standard (PAX), True USD (TUSD), and USD Coin (USDC). These four coins are represented by one token, the HUSD.Users can deposit any PAX, TUSD, USDC, or GUSD, and then withdraw any of these four tokens, regardless of which token was initially deposited. Neutral\u2019s article entitled \u201cCase Study of Huobi\u2019s HUSD Solution,\u201d explains,When you deposit any kind of stablecoins, they will be shown as HUSD in your account. You may withdraw any kind of stablecoin; when the balance amount of a certain stablecoin is not sufficient in your account, you may choose any other stablecoin with enough balance amount to withdraw.When announcing the launch of HUSD (V.1) in October 2018, Huobi Global claimed that the HUSD aimed to facilitate traders\u2019 decision-making processes among various stablecoins, while saving trading costs. However, design flaws were detected in the first HUSD version.According to Neutral, the problem with the original version stemmed from the fact that it allowed for 1:1 interchangeability between PAX, TUSD, USDC, and GUSD. That is, any of these coins could be exchanged for USD 1.However, Neutral notes that Huobi Global overlooked the fact that \u201cstablecoins are not interchangeable on a 1:1 basis even though they are equivalent in redeemable value.\u201dThese slight price discrepancies contributed to the issuance of various tokens to people at a rebate to increase liquidity. As a result,Traders then took advantage of the situation, using the HUSD solution to redeem and arbitrage for full price. In this situation the 1:1 ratio between stablecoins offered by HUSD did not hold, and market makers took advantage to earn a quick profit.HUSD Solution V2.0 now removes the fixed 1:1 exchange rate, basing the values between stablecoins not only on pricing but also on various other factors.For example, among other factors, the underlying stablecoin price is now set by data obtained from various mainstream exchanges. And, \u201cUsers have to designate time and amount independently to interchange stablecoins, going from an automatic exchange to a manual one.\u201dIs There a Stablecoin Craze?The stablecoins universe is expanding. For example, in October 2018, GMO Internet announced the launch of a Yen-pegged stablecoin. And, last month, Cryptogarage joined forces with Tokyo Tanshi to launch the Liquid sidechain based SETTLENET suite, which aims to be the first application Yen-pegged stablecoin.In January 2019, KRWb also announced the upcoming launch of the KRWb, which is going to be a 1:1 Korean Won-pegged stablecoin.This past week saw JPMorgan unveil its JPM Coin stablecoin that will be used in securities transactions and as part of the bank\u2019s treasury services features.Moreover, Facebook, according to a Bloomberg report, wants to issue its own stablecoin to allow WhatsApp users to exchange money.For many, stablecoins represent the future. As CoinJar co-founder Asher Tan put it, \u201cIt\u2019s a craze right now.\u201dDo you think stablecoins will become mainstream crypto assets shortly?

This overturns a previous court order, claiming that the SEC failed to prove that the token was a security.Another Day, Another Court CaseIn June last year, the SEC decreed pretty much every cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin and Ethereum to be a security. Since then, it has ramped up its ICO litigation, in what, at times, seemed like some kind of personal vendetta.Blockvest LLC and founder, Reginald Buddy Ringgold III (aka Rasool Abdul Rahim El), initially seem like any other unfortunate target. The SEC filed an emergency court order in October 2018, suspending the ICO, and halting all pre-ICO activities.The allegation was that Blockvest were raising funds for financial products promising passive income and double-digit returns. However, in November, a court ruled that the SEC had failed to prove that the BLV token was a security.Cue the popping of champagne corks by Reginald Bloody Whatever-he-wants-to-call-himself III.Hold Onto Your Horses ThoughThere was a little bit more to this story though, as Blockvest had (falsely) claimed that the fund was \u2018licensed and regulated.\u2019 It proudly boasted approval from major financial regulators, including the SEC, whose seal it illegally appropriated.Not content with this, Ringgold had also promoted the ICO with his own fake regulatory agency, the Blockchain Exchange Commission. The \u2018BEC\u2019 had a strangely similar seal to the SEC and shared the same address as the SEC headquarters.Whether the BLV token is a security or not, it is hard to argue that the ICO offer was not fraudulent in several respects. Also, the securities regulator has promised the aggressive pursuit of all unaccredited securities sold on the US market. Using its seal without permission is hardly going to inspire lenience.So, of course, the securities watchdog continued its pursuit, and as of February 14, had managed to convince the court that promotion of the BLV token was after all a security, according to the Howey test.Back at you, Reggie.What do you think of the regulator\u2019s actions?

One is a nursery school with a few classrooms, four toilets, an irrigation system, a 15,000-liter water system, and a sustainable farm for the entire village. The other is a primary school with more than a handful of classrooms, a cafeteria, bathrooms, solar panels, and a 35,000-liter water system.The third school will potentially be built in either Columbia, Ghana, Kenya, or Uganda.Paxful is not a newcomer to the Bitcoin scene, but it becomes increasingly more clear that the project is interested in providing greater financial access and freedom to the underserved, underdeveloped, and unbanked world through Bitcoin and education.What do you think of Paxful and its school-building initiatives?

He said that although blockchain had been 10 years in the making:No blockchain is currently capable of supporting large scale commercial applicationsAnd, no blockchain will\u2013for the foreseeable future, anyway\u2013the timeline for NEO 3.0 remains decidedly TBD. NEO 3.0 is meant to address NEO\u2019s current issues with gas price, platform stability, and scalability, among other things. However, Zhang neglected to mention that to pull this off they will likely require a complete overhaul of NEO as we know it\u2013a hard fork and possible return to a Genesis block.Top 5 New Features of NEO 3.0In the meantime, here are the top five new features the community can expect from NEO 3.0 (all of which won\u2019t happen next month, next quarter, or even next year). NEO 00 isn\u2019t even thinking about breaking ground with NEO 3.0 until 2020\u2013and that\u2019s an optimistic target.1. Native ContractsThe first new feature of NEO 3.0 will be the addition of a native contract. NEO\u2019s current smart contracts are run in NEO\u2019s VM and can be deployed by any user.With the native contract, they can run any native code directly, are embedded in the core code without deployment, and the contract upgrade does not cause hash changes. Why is this important? Because it will allow for instant verification of transactions, greatly increasing TPS speed. The addition of native contracts will also allow for unlimited data storage. 2. All Assets Created in Smart ContractsThere are a few ways to create assets on NEO, explains Zhang, but they are rarely used and most applications create contract assets (such as STOs) as they are more practical. Therefore, they will not support global assets in NEO 3.0. This will streamline and improve system performance. All assets will be created in smart contracts.3. Internet Resource AccessAnother very important new feature is internet resource access. This is equivalent to a built-in oracle in NEO. This will allow users to access internet resources in smart contracts through URLs. When such smart contract transactions are processed, the consensus nodes need to ensure data consistency. If the consensus nodes can reach a consensus on the data they read, the URL and data pair is written into the block header.After this, all other nodes can read consistent internet resources from the block header while executing the smart contract for the transaction.4. Improved dBFT Consensus MechanismThis will remove the problem of flaws in the network by adding additional steps in how the Consensus mechanism work. This is especially important when a node has been offline.When the Consensus node comes back online, it needs to synchronize with other nodes, which takes time. In the new dBFT, NEO will add a recovery log and recovery message, which means that dBFT can truly make transactions irreversible. Zhang states:This will be the best consensus mechanism for blockchain.5. NeoFSNEO smart contracts can store data, but it isn\u2019t practical. The cost is extremely high, which means that it cannot offer a workable solution for enterprises just yet.So, they plan to use NeoFS to build a low-cost distributed storage network that will support large enterprises. Users can use the space to store data by paying in gas and everyone in the network can earn gas by sharing unused hard disk space. Wrapping It UpIf you\u2019re trying to wrap your head around all that (as many people are), we\u2019ll be breaking it down further by asking the man with the answers\u2013co-founder Da Hongfei tomorrow. But basically, what it all amounts to is greater security, increased TPS, higher efficiency, and reducing the price. Oh, and making NEO \u201cthe best blockchain.\u201dAmbitious plans that will align the blockchain with the smart economy of the future. Just not any time soon.Can NEO become a serious rival to Ethereum and other smart contract platforms?

Does this mean Feb 5th drop to $100 was the 2019 bottom for Ethereum? Ethereum Price: Market OverviewOn Sunday Ethereum (ETH) 00 shifted into beast mode and steamrolled past the $125 and $130 resistance levels and onto new monthly highs. Analysts will probably spend the first few hours of the day trying to explain away what could have fueled such a spectacular move.Perhaps it was ETH Denver? Maybe its hype building up to Constantinople 2.0 and the 3rd\u2019ning fast approaching on February 25 \u2013 27? Possibly ETH bottomed when it touched $80 on December 15 and $100 on February 5th? Alternatively, it\u2019s possible that bulls are just chasing the money and throwing dosh at whatever chart has the most pleasing technical setup. Regardless of the reason, it\u2019s good to see green on the charts and like a pimply lad at Freshers week, any action is welcome in this bearish environment. Let\u2019s check the charts and try to break down what happened. 4-Hour ChartOn Sunday Ethereum price topped out at $137.48 which represents about a 12.5% move and the supposed king of altcoins also managed to cross above the 200MA for the first time in months. Moreover, the 50 MA and 200MA also crossed and for the first time in a while. ETH is looking better situated on the daily chart but a move above $158 is required to set a more convincing higher high on the weekly chart. Nonetheless, the convergence of these longer-term moving averages could mark a positive turn of events for Ethereum and the altcoin\u2019s mild divergence from BTC price action is also encouraging in the same way that LTC was the lead bull over the past two weeks. At the moment it appears that ETH needs to take a breather and recuperate as the current really looks extended with the RSI and Stoch in overbought territory. There\u2019s a clear bullish cross on the MACD and over the past 24-hours trading volume leaped 25% to a daily volume of $3.5 billion. Even though ETH price looks set to pull back a bit it is well above the bullish trendline with support near $125. ETH-USD Longs ChartETH-USD Longs ChartETH-USD Longs have reached a new all-time high compared ETH-USD shorts, which are now below their December 2018 low and it seems ETH is trying to set up for a longer play at $145 to $163 followed by $180. While all that is fantastically exciting, we all know by now that any sharp downward move from BTC can wreck the party and quickly bring ETH back to 2018 and 2019 lows. So while the technical setup looks attractive, traders must look beyond the ETH chart on the hourly, 4hr, daily and weekly and consider BTC-USD and BTC-ETH price action before making any long plays on the ETH-USD pair. At the time of publishing, it is a bit too early to tell if Ethereum price is entering consolidation on the hourly chart but traders can watch for a bounce at $132 and depending on the technical setup a purchase at $130 \u2013 $133 with sell stop order $1 to $2 dollars below purchase price might allow on to catch the next wave if ETH decided to march toward $140 and above. More conservative traders can wait to see how ETH reacts as it tests its underlying supports. The altcoin appears well supported above $120 and the most immediate supports are $132, $125, $123, $120. As always, trade safely my friends! What do you think ETH will do this week? All comments are welcome! [Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

It may, however, have slightly missed the boat, as it does ignore second layer protocols such as Lightning Network.Good Title, Shame About The RestThe author of the report, BDE\u2019s Deputy General Director of Financial Innovation and Market Infrastructures, Carlos Conesa, started well. He clearly deliberated for some time over the title, finally settling on \u2018Bitcoin: A solution for payment systems or a solution in search of a problem?\u2019Then follows the obligatory (for Central Bank Bitcoin analyses) 10 pages explaining what Bitcoin is and how it works. The second part of the report looks at whether Bitcoin makes a good payment system (spoiler alert: it doesn\u2019t). Unfortunately, Conesa\u2019s title rather sets the agenda for the whole report.Accurate Analysis\u2026 Misses The PointThe report takes the following form; analyze an essential attribute of Bitcoin; explain why this makes for an over-complicated payment system. For example, attributes such as decentralization and a lack of intermediaries are noted as a limitation to mass value exchange.Decentralization, suggests the report, requires a \u201cprocess of intensive validation in the consumption of resources, which reduces system efficiency.\u201d In contrast, \u201ccentralized systems with an intermediary trusted by the parties allow the design of much simpler and cheaper systems.\u201dWell yes, but then you have a centralized system and a need to trust an intermediary.According to Conesa, payment systems should facilitate the sending of money between two parties simply, economically, quickly and safely. In his opinion, the design of Bitcoin does not pursue these objectives, but that of a system without censorship.Or perhaps even a system which combines the two?Planned ObsolescenceOne of the main arguments Conesa makes against Bitcoin as a payment system is the ability to process transactions. He states that Bitcoin\u2019s potential 600,000 daily transactions are \u201cinsignificant\u201d compared to global retail payment systems.True, but with the development of Lightning Network, this statistic becomes \u201cinsignificant\u201d.It feels very much like BDE had to file a report criticizing Bitcoin and bigging-up the status quo. In order to do so, it had to willfully ignore the actual state of Bitcoin today and hope nobody realized. Disingenuous to say the least.Many technologies come with planned obsolescence. This report was already obsolete, years before it was published.Do you agree with Spain\u2019s central bank?

Localbitcoins functions on a P2P basis with users creating and accepting private sales of Bitcoin for fiat currency and vice versa.According to the Coin Dance data, traders exchanged over 10.3 billion rupiah ($730,000) last week, dwarfing the previous record of 4.5 billion ($319,000) set the week before.The phenomenon coincided with an announcement from Indonesia\u2019s Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency, also known as Bappebti, formalizing the need for exchanges to comply with AML laws, as part of a push to recognize cryptocurrency as a tradeable commodity.Prior to that, Bappebti had installed a minimum startup capital requirement for cryptocurrency futures operators, sparking anger from market participants who noted it was now cheaper to open an entire bank in the country.Localbitcoins Meets RegulatorsIndonesian consumer behavior \u2013 in line with those in inflation-stricken Venezuela \u2013 further underscores a common misconception among Bitcoin users. Localbitcoins, many believe, is an \u2018alternative\u2019 to identity requirements and regulation.While traders used to be able to transact on the platform in vague anonymity, the situation has changed rapidly over the past year as Localbitcoins strives to observe laws in its home jurisdiction of Finland. Earlier this month, executives warned that new EU directives would soon mean \u201cmajor changes\u201d for all Localbitcoins users regarding identity verification. Full details should appear in March, and will likely build on the existing measures forcing \u201clarge-volume\u201d accounts to provide passport details.

We take a look at what this means going into the week. Bitcoin Price: Weekly ChartThe weekly Bitcoin price 00 chart shows that bitcoin bulls defended previous resistance of $3536, turning it into support and never needed to rely upon the 200-week MA, which is rising quickly towards key support levels in the previous two weeks.Despite the weekly candle closing down at $3625, the bulls pushed hard into the early hours of Monday morning, reaching local highs of $3727 at the time of writing.Daily ChartThe daily chart reveals a clearer picture as to what lies ahead for Bitcoin price. A close above $3,700 today would mean that BTC/USD has successfully broken significant horizontal and diagonal resistance and would open the door to retesting the 2018 highs up towards $4,000.The has been a notable increase in the profile of the CMF, showing consistent higher lows, which as reported last week was implying that there was buying pressure in this market. This had now managed to find support and stay above zero for the first time since September 2018.Should Bitcoin price manage to break towards 4,000, it would show an Adam and Eve bottom pattern in the price action, which may open the door to much higher prices towards $5,000.However we must note that this has failed on several occasions in the bear market and is somewhat of a meme amongst traders. We would like to see a clear break of $4,000 with previous resistance turning to support retest as we have just witnessed at $3500 to give the bulls some confidence.4-Hour Chart Taking a deeper dive to the 4-hour timeframe, we can see that there was a good amount of volume on the breakout for BTC price, with $3700 being the first objective for the bulls to maintain on Monday.If bitcoin can successfully push on out of $3700 range, it would mean the completion of an inverted Head and shoulders on lower timeframes, which has the 1.618 Fibonacci target $3940 and $4040 as the measured move. This would complete the Adam and Eve meme discussed earlier.Failure to find support at $3700 may see a complete retracement of the move, or possibly worse. Typically a failed move would lead to a fast move in the opposite direction, but this is seemingly unlikely given the length of time support was held at $3500, but it should certainly not be rules out quite yet.Overall, a very positive start to the week and all eyes will be on the East cost of the United States, to pick up the baton and push Bitcoin price on to the next leg of this bullish move.Trade Bitcoin, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies on online Bitcoin forex broker platform evolve.markets.

As a technology which is still very much in its earliest phases, however, what does Lightning actually look like today?Familiar NumbersThe \u2018size\u2019 of the Lightning Network \u2013 the number of nodes relaying transactions, the number of payment channels and overall financial capacity \u2013 makes the press more often than other metrics.At press time, this was no exception, with all three figures at an all-time high. 6370 node and 28,800 channels currently comprise Bitcoin Lightning mainnet, with a total capacity of almost 700 BTC.In the past month alone, nodes, channels and capacity have increased by 15 percent, 33 percent and 28 percent respectively. Surprising HotspotsWho is behind such rapid expansion of Lightning? A glance at the statistics reveals various somewhat surprising facts.For example, while the US has the lion\u2019s share of nodes and channels, along with almost 80 percent of capacity, the city with the most nodes is in fact Toronto, Canada.Those Canadian nodes contribute a capacity value of 24.4 BTC. That makes Toronto third on the cities list; above it lie Frankfurt, Germany (25.2 BTC) and Ashburn, Virginia, where almost 60 percent of capacity is hosted.Fourth place is another German city, Nuremberg, indicating that Lightning is already diversifying outside the US.Other cities in the top twenty by overall contribution stats include Berlin, Hamburg, Singapore and Amsterdam.Publicity ImpactAs Bitcoinist reported, the past month has seen Lightning gain mainstream publicity few imagined possible even six months ago.As a result of a transaction relay among users, Lightning Torch, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has publicily lauded the technology, even hinting it could integrate into his companies Twitter and Square in future.The knock-on effects have included a social media lobbying effort to make Tesla founder Elon Musk participate in the relay, which itself aims to further awareness and understanding of using Bitcoin via Lightning.Other efforts to boost user numbers have come in the form of consumer projects such as Lightning Pizza, which aims to allow anyone in the US, Canada and potentially Europe to order pizza using the network.What do you think about the Lightning Network?

Self-proclaimed creator of Bitcoin, Craig Wright, now appears willing to testify under oath that he is Satoshi Nakamoto. Or that\u2019s the conclusion Ran NeuNer draws, following Wright\u2019s response to a comment request from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).I Promise To Tell The Truth, The Whole Truth, And Nothing But The TruthIn December 2018, the CFTC published a Request For Input (RFI) on \u2018Crypto-Assets Mechanics and Markets.\u2019 This was primarily to understand more about Ethereum, and the differences between Ether and Bitcoin. As the CFTC is a federal agency, responses to RFIs should be\u2026 well, not fraudulent, at any rate.On 15th February 2019, Wright posted his response, introducing himself and stating:under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto I completed a project I started in 1997 that was filed with the Australian government\u2026 as BlackNet.He goes on to claim that the amount of misunderstanding and fallacious information around blockchain systems (including Ethereum) has resulted in his decision to become more public.So Dr. Craig Wright is willing to testify under oath that he is Satoshi Nakamoto and the founder of Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/WsqHhXnQzl\u2014 Ran NeuNer (@cryptomanran) February 17, 2019It isn\u2019t particularly relevant to the RFI, really serving only to repeat the claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto\u2026 albeit in a Federal forum.I am Satoshi Nakamoto, And So Is My WifeAt this point, Wright\u2019s claims are becoming a farce of Monty Python\u2019s Life Of Brian proportions. After he first \u2018came out\u2019 as Satoshi Nakamoto, and the crypto-world widely coughed *bullshit* under its breath, he let it lie.But now frontrunning his own project Bitcoin SV (Satoshi\u2019s Vision), his alleged \u2018amendments\u2019 to historical documents seems to be going into overdrive. Only last week he was pulled up by WikiLeaks for altering a 2008 blog-post to make it look like he\u2019d been working on crypto back then.Mere hours prior, he was accused of using a forged a 2001 research paper as evidence of his lineage. It was a word-for-word copy of the October 2008 Bitcoin whitepaper. It even already had amendments that he (as Satoshi Nakamoto) made from the August 2008 draft of the same document.

What would the consequences of that be?Obviously, Wright is such an unpopular figure that we aren\u2019t all going to start believing (and investing) in Bitcoin SV. Although one can only imagine that this is the point of all this alleged forgery.Why carefully protect your identity only to then come out to the world via GQ \u2013 telling the critics to \u201cpiss off!\u201d and reminding entire countries that he\u2019s got more money than them?But would we all eschew Bitcoin if we found out that he had actually been the inventor?No, of course not.

The cryptocurrency mining hardware behemoth says the new and improved 7-nm chip offers greater energy efficiency for mining operations.More Energy Efficient Bitcoin MiningThe company announced the news in a blog post published on Monday (February 18, 2019), on its official blog. According to the statement, the new BM1397 chip offers faster and cheaper cryptocurrency mining.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Bitmain\u2019s chip supplying contractor, manufactured the chip using the former\u2019s 7nm FinFET process. Bitmain says its new class of 7-nm chips is designed for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash that use the SHA256 Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining algorithm.According to the company, the new mining processor provides significant improvements in power efficiency from the earlier 7-nm chips released in November 2018. An excerpt of the announcement reads:The new BM1397 chip requires lower power and can offer an energy consumption to computing ratio as low as 30J/TH. This is a 28.6 percent improvement in power efficiency in comparison with Bitmain\u2019s previous 7nm chip, the BM1391.The post also revealed that new upgraded 7-nm chips would come as part of the proposed S17 and T17 Antminer models. Bitmain is yet to disclose any timetable for when these new miners will be ready for release.Difficult 2018 for BitmainBitmain will be hoping that the launch of a new mining processor will spark efforts to improve the company\u2019s fortunes following a tumultuous 2018. A wrong bet on Bitcoin Cash saw the company reportedly incur losses more than $740 million in Q3 2018 alone.In Q4 2018, the mining behemoth also significantly reduced its staff strength laying off entire departments. First, the company fired its Israeli-based R&D department before laying off its Bitcoin Cash development team.Co-founders Jihan Wu and Ketuan Zhan also faced the ax, as reports emerged that the company was shopping for a new CEO.Bitmain\u2019s IPO plans was also another victim of the company\u2019s difficult 2018.

In their place, it has instituted its own cryptocurrency \u2014 City Coin. The not-so-cleverly-named cryptocurrency will replace all other forms of legal tender.A spokesman told Express.co.uk:City Coin is a secure and innovative cryptocurrency based on City Chain, a smart city platform that enables the design, implementation and use of next-generation services for smart cities and their inhabitants. As the first cryptocurrency to be officially adopted by a smart city, City Coin is the only medium of exchange within Liberstad. It will be used for the payment of city services and worker wages and for funding civic projects. Inhabitants can pay for anything ranging from haircuts, a dozen local eggs or an artisan loaf of bread using CITY, marking a milestone for real-world use of blockchain technology. Over 100 land plots have already been sold within Liberstad and more will become available to purchase using CITY in the near future.While the prospect may seem farfetched, it bears remembering that Liberstad is a small city based on The Libertania Project\u2019s principles of anarchism and non-aggression. According to its official website, it is a private city in which \u201call property is private and all services are performed by private actors\u201d and founded on the belief \u201cthat all human interactions should be voluntary.\u201dThe spokesman also told the daily national middle-market tabloid newspaper:We are a small group of individuals who are seeking a change in the way society works. We want a society where people decide over themselves and can live together without government authorities. Liberstad will become a city where anarchism can get a physical foothold in one of the world\u2019s most socialist countries. We also want a city where everyone has the opportunity to buy both houses and land for a price that is far below other house and cottage prices in Norway. In Liberstad you will be able to live without high mortgage or rent, and without any direct and indirect taxes. Liberstad will become a city where life is easier, more relaxing and without the high cost of living. In the long term, we can together develop a private city where people have greater freedom and opportunity to live the life they desire.Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and libertarianism have long gone hand-in-hand. Liberstad and City Coin are just further small examples of what could be in store for freedom-loving individuals in the not-so-distant future.What do you think of Liberstad and City Coin?

While the figure itself is unsurprisingly, Pair\u2019s advocacy contrasts dramatically with comments he made just two years ago.

The project also pioneers a new concept for blockchain-based projects by replacing inefficient ICOs with Production-Oriented Token Sales (POTS).Current Issues with Online AdvertisingWhile being omnipresent, online ads are continuously facing a barrage of challenges which make them far less effective. Current ad networks oftentimes deliver non-targeted ads to more than passive audiences who are also fairly defensive against such market tactics.In the process, potential buyers oftentimes get overlooked while businesses keep expanding their budgets without getting any notable and worthy results.An Elegant SolutionWeBuy presents the very first on-demand advertising platform which will enable the buyers to choose how, when, and why they can be reached by any potential seller.Instead of swamping the buyer with less than targeted ads, WeBuy allows the latter to opt-in to be reached. In other words, the buyer will only be able to see ads when he wants to. Furthermore, he will only be able to see the ads which he is interested in seeing..By leveraging geolocation tools, WeBuy will enable the sellers to be in full control of their ad budgets. This also guarantees that they will be able to target the right market.Buyers and Sellers put at the ForefrontWeBuy puts both the buyer and the seller at the forefront, completely eliminating the need for any third parties.In order to encourage sellers to join the network, each seller will receive a welcome grant of $500 from WeBuy. It will be in the form of advertisement credits. The income will be generated from the seller and it will be based on the fees which are paid for ads to reach the potential buyers. However, sellers will also receive the opportunity to only target localized buyers who have already expressed interest in their products or services.Buyers, on the other hand, will be incentivized to get contacted from sellers without having to place any buying commitment. They will receive a substantial portion of the fees received for agreeing to see an ad as well. Their rewards will be in the form of WBY tokens.Production-Oriented Token Sale: The Future of CrowdfundingHaving identified the issues stemming from initial coin offerings (ICOs), WeBuy will approach crowdfunding in a completely different way, putting project responsibility, logic, and transparency at the forefront.The project will conduct a Production-Oriented Token Sale (POTS) by breaking up the entire crowdfunding process into a few different rounds. Each one of them will be funded according to clear, predefined tasks. For each round, the company will publish its plan for the funds that it\u2019s raising and a report at the end of the given period.This guarantees total transparency regarding the allocation of funds and it will enable investors to clearly evaluate the achievements of the company based on the report of the current and previous POTS periods.WBY tokens will be denominated in Stellar Lumens (XLM) and the 1st POTS Sale will aim to raise $2,000,000. WBY will be available for sale on the Stellar Exchange on January 7th. The initial price will be set to $0.25. WeBuy may announce bonuses in the future.You can read more about the WeBuy platform and their revolutionary new crowdfunding model on the official website.Stay tuned on WeBuy\u2019s Facebook and Twitter page to receive regular updates.

New Bitmain CEOAccording to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the Bitcoin mining behemoth is looking to name a new CEO to replace the company\u2019s co-founders. Anonymous sources say, Haichao Wang, the current Engineering Director is the front-runner for the job.Jihan WuWhile there is no official word from Bitmain, these sources say the company entered a leadership transition period in December 2018.Back in November 2018, Bitcoinist reported Wu\u2019s demotion from director to a supervisor. Also, in late December 2018, reports broke out in Chinese media of the imminent resignation of both Wu and Zhan.There is also no definite timetable for the completion of the leadership reshuffle. Sources indicate that both Wu and Zhan will become co-chairs of the company. The new CEO will handle the daily administration of the firm while the pair will still have the final say on big decisions.According to SCMP sources, both Wu and Zhan had disagreements as co-CEO. Wu, in particular, has come under intense criticism for the company\u2019s bet on Bitcoin Cash. Zhan, on the other hand, has led Bitmain\u2019s diversification efforts, especially into the artificial intelligence arena.Turning the TideIf the reports are accurate and Bitmain does get a new CEO, a daunting task awaits the selected individual. After a stellar 2017 and a promising start to 2018, the second half of the year appeared to fizzle out for the Bitcoin mining behemoth.Bitmain is yet to release its Q3 2018 financial report, but speculation is rife of losses north of $740 million. A lot of the financial trouble stems from inventory losses, as well as the expensive Bitcoin Cash hash war of November 2018.Recently, the company even began laying off a significant portion of its workforce. In December 2018, Bitmain fired its R&D department based in Israel. This move was followed by another massive downsizing, nixing the company\u2019s Bitcoin Cash development team.The company\u2019s IPO plan is also another casualty of the financial turmoil within the company. Despite announcing plans for an IPO listing in Hong Kong earlier in 2018, all signs point to such plans being unfeasible, for the present time, at least.Will a new CEO be able to steer Bitmain in a better direction?

Users can now send and receive Bitcoin Lightning payments right to/from your mobile device, the ramifications of which could be revolutionary for the future of online payments. Bitcoin Lightning Wallets Are Setting the BarFollowing the first review of Bluewallet by Bitcoinist less than a week ago, the wallet app now supports generating invoices and thus, receiving Lightning Network (LN) payments right to your mobile device. Meanwhile, Wallet of Satoshi is another recently-launched \u2018mum-friendly\u2019 mobile app targeted at the Australian market that already supports similar functionality. There are a few more newly-released LN wallets making waves, though Bluewallet and Wallet of Satoshi are the easiest to get started with due to their simplicity. Australians can use Wallet of Satoshi to send BTC via Lightning Network to pay bills and buy products at participating merchants in Australia, which includes Brisbane Airport and online services such as Tippin. @walletofsatoshi works beautifully with @tippin_me \u26a1#bitcoin #LightningNetwork pic.twitter.com/VpjF1NtYy5\u2014 jordoDev (@jordoDev) January 5, 2019Together, these two \u2018grandma-friendly\u2019 wallets are making it easy to send and receive payments. What\u2019s more is that these transactions can be as small as a fraction of a cent, the implications of which can be nothing less of revolutionary. Here\u2019s why\u2026Online Micro-Transactions Becoming ViableRemember ChangeTip? Founded in 2013, it enabled Bitcoin users to send micropayments across various social media websites. Unfortunately, the service apparently wasn\u2019t economically viable. Friction due to on-chain transaction fees and confirmation wait times made the user-experience rather inconvenient, particularly for sending small amounts. Ultimately, the service was shut down in 2016 after it was acquired by Airbnb. But now, the aforementioned wallets may be able to resurrect this concept as transactions are now instant at almost zero-cost with LN payments. Tippin is one such promising application for online micro-payments similar to ChangeTip but harnessing LN payments for a better experience. Meanwhile, another similar service is already being used on Reddit. The LN tipbot lets anyone tip on the platform using text commands. Admittedly, the function is still in its infancy but the arrival of bidirectional and easy-to-use Bitcoin LN wallets now lets you collect these tips right to your mobile device in seconds. For example, receiving a tip will look something like this: Ten thousand satoshis equal to about 40 cents. So if you\u2019d like to receive these funds to your Bluewallet, for example, simply click \u2018withdraw\u2019 to take you to the next screen:Replace the \u201cput_invoice_here\u201d with your invoice number that you can generate in your Lightning wallet by clicking \u2018Receive.\u2019 Specify the amount you\u2019d like to withdraw: 10,000 satoshis (though this can be any amount under 10K) and write a short description for yourself.Click \u2018Create\u2019 to generate the invoice. It will look like this:Copy and paste that invoice address to replace the \u201cput_invoice_here\u201d in the message box and Send the message to the Reddit Ln tipbot.The invoice is paid within 10-15 seconds and the Bluewallet invoice then shows the following message:The satoshi balance in your LN wallet will now reflect the received amount.The entire process is quick and takes about a few seconds once you get the hang of it. What\u2019s more, the fee is \u201cunfairly cheap.\u201d In fact, I can\u2019t even tell you what it was as there are only two zeros displayed after the decimal \u2013 so I assume it\u2019s a tiny fraction of a cent.The process also worked flawlessly with an even smaller amount of 10 satoshis (or 0.0003831 cents).Bitcoin Can Now Scale Beyond VisaThe arrival of this new generation of mobile wallets gives a glimpse into the future of online payments.Admittedly, some issues still remain like the inability to withdraw satoshis from the LN wallet to your on-chain BTC wallet, a feature that will be introduced in Bluewallet soon.In the meantime, the Lightning Network is growing rapidly and now boasts over 5,000 nodes with over $2 million USD in capacity.This second layer developing on top of Bitcoin is poised to become the future of quick and cheap online payments while potentially making altcoins, designed for faster and cheaper transactions, in particular, obsolete.Prior to LN, Bitcoin could handle roughly seven transactions per second (tps), which critics argued would prevent it from competing with the likes of VISA that can process up to 45,000 tps.But Bitcoin\u2019s LN promises to not only handle millions of transaction per second but also enables sending fractions of a penny (and even a fraction of a satoshi, something that\u2019s not possible on-chain) to anyone in the world.This should certainly bolster Bitcoin adoption moving forward. But the ramifications of this technology could also be revolutionary in other ways.Viable micro-transactions will introduce new ways of monetizing online content. This means innovative online revenue streams the likes of which we haven\u2019t even seen yet. Moreover, this means innovative online business models that can challenge the existing advertising-based and censorship-prone system.In the meantime\u2026Lightning-powered arm wrestling anyone?Lightning powered arm wrestling. \ud83d\udcaa\u26a1 #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/FrtQ7jynMW\u2014 A v B \u26a1 (@ArminVanBitcoin) January 4, 2019Have you tried Lightning Network?

Mark your calendars and keep a watch for these events that could have a massive impact on Bitcoin price this year. 2019: The Year Wall Street Embraces Bitcoin?Throughout 2018, the fall in Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) prices dominated the news circuit. However, despite the nearly 80 percent peak-to-trough slide for BTC, some positive developments emerged in the industry.When the CME and CBOE BTC futures came online in late 2017, a lot of the expectation for 2018 centered on the institutionalization of the market. While the process seemed slow, there was some progress in that regard.Concerning 2019, there are projects expected to take off, as well as other events that should shape the course of the market going forward. Here are some of the important Bitcoin dates for at least, the first quarter of the new year.Bakkt Physical-Delivery BTC Futures: \u2018Early 2019\u2019By the end of Q1 2019, the CME and CBOE BTC futures won\u2019t be the only ones in the market. Bakkt, founded by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), operators of the New York Stock Exchange, has revised its expected launch date from January 24 to \u201cearly 2019\u201d.The platform plans to be the first to offer BTC-settled Bitcoin futures contract. Recently, Bitcoinist reported that Bakkt raised $182.5 million from Microsoft and other big-name investors in its first funding round.The Bakkt launch might hit a snag though, given the current U.S. government shutdown. ICE plans to provide an updated timeline for the Bakkt launch in 2019.Nasdaq BTC Futures: Q1 2019Nasdaq also plans to launch its BTC futures listing after intense speculation on the matter throughout 2018. There are, however, not many details about the proposed launch. What is known is that the company plans to launch the product before the end of Q1 2019.Both Bakkt and Nasdaq are awaiting approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Bakkt has repeatedly declared that it is working in tandem with the CFTC to obtain the green light for its BTC futures contract.VanEck/SolidX BTC ETF: Late February-Early MarchWhenever there was any talk of institutional adoption of BTC in 2018, the mention of an SEC-approved ETF was never far away. Despite the clamor, the Commission ended 2018 without approving any of the BTC ETF filings.The VanEck/SolidX submission of a BTC-backed ETF was the only one from 2018 not given a definitive verdict by the SEC. Back in December, the SEC delayed its decision to approve or reject the filing to February 27, 2019.The Commission has no more room any further delays and must decide on the commodity-backed VanEck/SolidX BTC ETF proposal. For the entities involved, they say that their submission satisfies many of the concerns held by the SEC against Bitcoin ETFs.Mt. Gox Coins Redistribution: Away from Bitcoin futures and ETFs, there is also the matter of the Mt. Gox coin distribution event. Approval for the civil rehabilitation plan will come in February 2019. After that, the first round of payments to creditors is planned to process \u201cas soon as possible\u201d though this may actually start sometime between May and June 2019.Mt. Gox still holds about 166,000 BTC and 168,000 BCH, currently valued at $665.5 million.Will 2019 be the year when the institutionalization of Bitcoin becomes firmly established?

Life coach, Tony Robbins, just explained all to his 3+ million Twitter followers, and just in time for New Year.Tony\u2019s ThemeTony\u2019s Tweet links to a blog post on his website credited to \u2018Team Tony\u2019, which they must have written at the start of the year, based on the quoted bitcoin price ($9979).Perhaps the bitcoin price 00 volatility at that time made him choose not to promote the post until now.

Find out here. https://t.co/KkenntACZd\u2014 Tony Robbins (@TonyRobbins) December 30, 2018Anyway, the blog post suggests that trying to explain Bitcoin is like trying to explain the Internet in the 1980s. The difficulty being that Bitcoin is a brand new concept. Well to the majority of Tony Robbins fans it probably still is.New Year\u2019s RevolutionAfter going into some detail on the basic tenets of what Bitcoin is, how it works, and the mining process, Team Tony tries to answer the question of \u2018What separates Bitcoin from currencies that have gone before it?\u2019i.e. They try to explain its decentralized nature\u2026 and do a surprisingly good job of it.No single bank, government, company or individual owns the network or has control over it. This means that your accounts can never be frozen, a government cannot devalue the currency, it can be used in every country\u2026Well, that\u2019s got to sound pretty appealing, even to your average Tony Robbins fan; let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t\u2026\u2026more ominously, because of the anonymous nature of bitcoin, the technically savvy can avoid taxation and use bitcoin as payment for any kind of illegal good or service.Why Is This Important?Despite slipping into FUD mode, the fact that Tony Robbins has tweeted about Bitcoin (and the timing) is significant. As one of the best-known life coaches in the world, Robbins has an almost fanatical devotion from his followers.Introducing 3 million of them on Twitter alone \u2013 many of whom will not already be crypto-savvy \u2013 to Bitcoin at a time when people are thinking about financial plans for the coming year, could be a big deal indeed.It also comes at a time as when Bitcoin awareness is also being spread by the likes of other influential figures like Jordan Peterson and even publications like Time magazine, which stressed that Bitcoin is important for freedom in the world.Does Tony Robbins\u2019 article do a good job explaining Bitcoin?

The point was further elaborated upon in a Medium post by Murad Mahmudov and David Puell.Bitcoin\u2019s Realized Value RatioThe Realized Value ratio is calculated by dividing the daily market value by realized value on a daily basis. It calculates the aggregated value of UTXOs priced on their value when they were last moved. If 10,000 BTC haven\u2019t moved from their wallet since 2011, for example, they are valued at the price at that time rather than current valuations. Something like this cuts considerably BTC\u2019s market cap. Realized Value adjusts for lost coins and coins that are not being moved. By aggregating the UTXOs and assigning them a price based on the BTC/USD market price 00 at the time when the UTXOs were last moved. Realized Value differentiates itself from Market Capitalization, which is determined when you multiply the latest available BTC spot price on exchanges by the number of bitcoins mined to date. \u201cRealized cap seems to suggest the final layer of people\u2019s cumulative cost basis and, in recent history, the ultimate line of \u201ccenter of mass\u201d where 2017 strong buyers remain unrattled by short-term uncertainty,\u201d writes David Puell and Murad Mahmudov. Realized value helps account for lost, unused, unclaimed coins from the total value circulation, and as an indicator of the sum of the price levels where long-term holders bought Bitcoin. When the Market-Value-to-Realized-Value (MVRV) ratio is calculated by dividing market value by realized value on a daily basis, two historical thresholds, one representing overvaluation and another representing undervaluation, become clear. \u201cJust as the upper levels of MVRV suggest the climax of euphoria, overshooting it\u2019s \u2018fair\u2019 value at the peaks, price action as discovered at exchanges tends to undershoot beyond BTC\u2019s \u2018real value at the bottoms,\u201d write the authors. Looking back at the past two Bitcoin bear cycles, we can say without a doubt that both occasions proved to be the most opportune periods to accumulate bitcoins.Over an extended period on a log chart, realized value of Bitcoin resembles a stepwise function thanks to near-vertical moves northward during the hottest months of a bull market and prolonged times of horizontal flatness. \u201c[E]ach flatness level could be roughly interpreted as Bitcoin\u2019s newfound stable fair value threshold,\u201d they write. The traditional market cap, however, is more sharply pronounced by the emotion of the crowds, namely excessive euphoria when market value sharply diverges upwards away from realized value, and, conversely, excessive fear when the market value drops below realized value for a multi-month period.The authors anticipate market value to fall below realized value on a mid-term basis, \u201cwhich in turn would establish a structural gap between them, to be filled after an accumulation period of potentially as long as several months.\u201d They add some caveats to their new indicator.\u201cGoing forward, as market cap decreases in volatility, we believe that the upper threshold of MVRV might not prove as reliable \u2014 as market cap overextends less and less above realized cap as time progresses,\u201d they state. However, we expect the lower threshold to remain useful to detect Bitcoin\u2019s undervaluation in multi-month periods ripe for accumulation. This is to say that the saving power and the speculative power of Bitcoin will become, increasingly more and more, very closely intertwined.MVRV ShortfallsThere are also some shortcomings, the authors admit. \u201cMVRV ratio only provides a long-term perspective of Bitcoin price market cycles \u2014 specifically, to apply Wyckoffian terminology, distribution and accumulation phases,\u201d the authors write. When using MVRV, they recommend comparing it with other fundamental and technical tools and use it for multi-yearly analyses. They also note that realized cap may decline in black-swan events when even strong hands lose confidence in BTC. \u201cFor this reason, we recommend assessing the market value and realized value both as a ratio and separately.\u201dMahmudov and Puell argue that there are speculators during periods of irrational exuberance and \u201chodlers\u201d who acclimate to market uncertainty over time. We believe that both market concepts and participants are crucial for Bitcoin\u2019s game theory and price action, since the booms seem to expand the network via an exuberant viral gossip mechanism that broadcasts the existence of Bitcoin to the world population; while the busts, in the long run, seem to reward individuals who chose to delay short-term financial gratification in the search for sound money. \u201cThis very dichotomy, in our opinion, also explains the relevance and effectiveness of MVRV ratio. Network value, to go back to Willy Woo\u2019s terminology, is to us both market value and realized value,\u201d they add.Realized Value actually surpassed Market Capitalization on November 30 when Realized Value reached $83 billion with Market Cap at $75 billion. Can MVRV track interactions between market actors to better determine value? What do you think?Images courtesy of ShutterstockThe Rundown Bitcoin\u2019s Realized Value RatioMVRV Shortfalls"}

The tiny alpine country famous for its expensive watches welcomed blockchain companies at first. Then Swiss banks began to stop working with them one by one, and Switzerland looked to be the land of promise no longer. It\u2019s interesting then, that Lamassu has given crypto here a much-needed vote of confidence by calling Switzerland its new home.Lamassu Picks Switzerland for Its Well-Defined RulesIn a blog post published on Medium, the oldest Bitcoin ATM manufacturer established in 2013 explains that \u201cafter years\u201d of searching for the best place for their headquarters, they finally found it in the canton of Lucerne, adding that:Crypto Valley is alive and kicking and we\u2019re excited to be in an area so rich in crypto development and blockchain events.Lamassu is one of the most popular Bitcoin machines today, with 433 Bitcoin ATMs worldwide, seven so far in Switzerland. However, with Bitcoin fans now able to buy bitcoins with their train tickets at over 1,000 machines in the country, the company chose Switzerland not only to roll out more product but also for its \u201cwell-defined\u201d rules.However, not all is as it seems in Switzerland, once home to the largest number of ICOs. When banking giant UBS closed accounts for crypto companies, all major Swiss banks followed suit.But with crypto-friendly countries such as Malta, Lichtenstein, and even Germany close to home, Swiss authorities began to halt the exodus of blockchain companies from its pastures.The Swiss Banking Association (SBA) laid out clearer guidelines for banks on how to work with crypto companies in an attempt to retain its crypto-friendly title.It should be noted that having a bank account as a crypto company still poses several risks. Companies can be subject to routine account freezes or even asked to move their funds to another institution with little notice.Yet Lamassu seems undeterred:Exciting stuff is happening in Switzerland at every level. Open source Bitcoin and Lightning Network nodes are being hacked together, hardware wallets are being designed and manufactured, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency regulations are being carefully guided, world-class meetups and events are happening, and lots of Bitcoin ATMs are being deployed.The number of Bitcoin ATMs around the world doubled in 2018 and now stands at just over 4,000. This is what Lamassu calls \u201cbooming.\u201d The company says that it wants its home to be a place where rules are well defined and regulators are open to innovation.Banking the UnbankableDespite Switzerland\u2019s scuffle between the banks and crypto, Lamassu has had it far worse in the past. The Bitcoin ATM maker explains that in its native Portugal, the company was unable to find a bank to work with them.We\u2019ve been bankless for the past year. We must have been rejected by fifteen banks just because we manufacture terminals for Bitcoin.Why don\u2019t banks want to work with crypto companies? It (mainly) boils down to lax AML practices and the fact that crypto\u2019s KYC policies aren\u2019t up to the standards of banks. Somewhat ironic when you consider the case after case of large name banks embroiled in corruption and money laundering charges.Moreover, Lamassu does not trade in cryptocurrency nor store cryptocurrency, it is merely a marker of hardware. But one of the company\u2019s first concerns about choosing a new jurisdiction was that they would be able to open a bank account. According to the blog post, they had a \u201cnice chat\u201d with a small bank in a Swiss canton called Aargau and have finally been allowed to open a bank account. They even enthuse:In fact, you should expect to see one of our cryptomats [Bitcoin ATMs] in their headquarters early this year.Banking for Bitcoin Companies Is Still a StruggleWhile the Bitcoin ATM manufacturer may have lucked out with a little-known bank in this fiscally lenient part of the world, the struggle is still very real for most crypto companies. Lamassu, in fact, was denied by international payment processor Stripe simply because the word Bitcoin appears on their website. They state that if Stripe had been a Swiss company, this probably would not have been the case. Perhaps. But it\u2019s certainly not a guarantee.However, the company is looking to start 2019 in a positive way and is \u201cpsyched\u201d to be part of an innovative and crypto-friendly ecosystem in Lucerne. They\u2019ll even be contributing to it by holding a monthly meetup dedicated to free speech, free markets, and decentralization.First Luzern Cypherpunx meetup Jan 18, 2019! Venue to be announced soon.\u2014 Luzern Cypherpunx (@LUCPunx) December 30, 2018While Switzerland is encouraging more banks to work with crypto companies, it\u2019s not all green lights just yet. One has to wonder how long the honeymoon period for Lamassu will continue.Will Switzerland be a good home for Bitcoin ATM manufacturer Lamassu?

Proof of Keys, announced by Mayer last month, aims to increase cryptocurrency investors\u2019 proficiency in understanding decentralized networks, principally Bitcoin. By taking control of private keys and not relying on third parties to hold them, Mayer argues investors will help educate others, thus aiding adoption. HitBTC meanwhile has faced much controversy in its six-year history, this often revolving around the offering of dubious futures contracts and tokens, along with opaque operating practices.On Twitter, both Mayer\u2019s and McAfee\u2019s tweets saw multiple accusations of corruption and \u201cscam\u201d practices on the part of the company, but not everyone appeared convinced.The Crypto Dog, an account mostly offering trading advice, suggested the timing was more coincidental than targeted at Proof of Keys, but that it provided a \u201cnarrative\u201d by which to expose HitBTC\u2019s other transgressions.

Just like it was in the early days of the internet, it\u2019s not so simple for the average person to tap into the advantages of crypto assets, nor are the advantages even clear to everyone at this point.I remember well the great debate about the usefulness of the internet that raged throughout the 90s.

Some sour manufacturing data in China was released this morning and stocks in Asia and Europe are taking a hit.Still, the new year hangover hasn\u2019t yet completely worn off. It won\u2019t be until Monday that markets really return to full strength. The New York session may prove exciting, though. As we saw last week, low volume trading can often turn volatile, especially as we head into the 12th day of a partial government shutdown.President Trump\u2019s all caps new years tweet also carried what some have interpreted as a hidden message for the financial markets.On the Safe SideThe US President\u2019s reassurances have done very little for investors this morning though, who do seem to be erring on the side of caution.Gold continues to climb, both on the current uncertainty of global politics and the weaker US Dollar. We\u2019re now testing the psychological level of $1,300 per ounce. This level probably won\u2019t be very easy to breach, especially coming off the strong run we\u2019ve seen over the last month.Crude oil is also testing a boundary at the moment but on the downside.

This new free market has a lot more competition, which is spurring on more production and more supply.The level of $45 a barrel is being watched very closely.Building up CryptoNow that it seems the US is unlikely to approve any bitcoin backed ETF any time soon, the number one event on the watchlist of many cryptotraders is the launch of Bakkt.For those of you who are not familiar, Bakkt is a new crypto service that was started by the owners of the New York Stock Exchange, which plans to offer a crypto holding service and debit card that it will make it very easy for everyday customers to store and spend bitcoin.Over the weekend, Bakkt announced an extremely successful funding round of $182.5 million that has come from various Wall Street institutions and should ensure a smooth launch of the new service.However, the launch of their platform was supposed to be on December 12th but was later delayed to January 24th. Possibly due to the US government shutdown, it seems that the launch has again been delayed, this time without a confirmed launch date.We know that it\u2019s going to happen and that it\u2019s very likely to be a great step forward for crypto adoption but it seems we\u2019ll need to continue being patient while they get set up.Before I let you go for today, I did want to ask you to take part in a short survey.

But exchange rate is just one of many metrics we can use to observe the evolution of this ecosystem,\u201d he explained.While any given metric can be gamed or may be taken from sources that aren\u2019t 100% reliable, by using a diversity of metrics and sources we can get a better rough idea of what\u2019s going on.In summary, Lopp described 2018 as being both the \u201cbest year\u201d and \u201cworst year\u201d for Bitcoin, depending on what metrics one prioritizes. His comments match those from other Bitcoin bulls in recent weeks, notably Spencer Bogart who stated that Bitcoin\u2019s fundamentals are still very much intact.Another permabull, namely Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, reaffirmed his belief last month in the limited appeal of price analysis. \u201cBitcoin is going to be between $3000 and $6000 and hopefully next year we\u2019ll start to see the move up,\u201d he told Bloomberg.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to smash it right now, but if you look at it from a broader perspective, it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201dWhat do you think Bitcoin network\u2019s performance in 2018?

Blockchain can assist in KYC, back-office automation, and underwriting of micro-insurance.Several Islamic Financial Institutions are Trying BlockchainEmirates Islamic was the first Islamic bank to test blockchain. It is part of the UAE\u2019s Emirates NBD banking group. As early as 2017 the bank integrated the technology into cheque-based payment processes. This strengthened their authenticity and minimized the potential for fraud. The UAE-based Al Hilal Bank became the world\u2019s first Islamic Bank to complete a sukuk transaction on the blockchain on the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial center. A sukuk is an Islamic financial certificate, kind of like a bond in Western finance, that complies with Sharia-Islamic religious law. Based on the Ethereum blockchain, the system was developed by Dubai-incubated fintech startup Jibrel Network. This company provides currencies, equities, commodities, and other financial assets as standard ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.\u201cWe are proud to be the first bank to launch a \u2018smart blockchain Islamic sukuk\u2019,\u201d said Alex Coelho, CEO of Al Hilal Bank. He highlighted blockchain\u2019s \u201ccost efficiency, robust Shariah-compliance and the unlocking of new opportunities.\u201dThe Islamic Corp for the Development of Private Sector (ICD) first cooperated with cryptocurrency startups on smart contracts and other blockchain-based innovations for Islamic Finance. An ICD partner, iFinTech Solution, based in Tunis, is developing blockchain products to solve liquidity management challenges and commodity transactions in Islamic finance, including interbanking relations between conventional and Islamic banks to ensure Shariah-compliance.\u201cInformation technology will always play an important role in the financial system,\u201d said ICD\u2019s new CEO Ayman Sejiny. We will consistently pursue our strategy of service orientation and help our partners with innovative Shariah-compliant fintech solutions.The IDB\u2019s Islamic Research and Training Institute, furthermore, is working with fintech firms Ateon from Riyadh and SettleMint from Dubai on blockchain-based smart contracts in order to create Shariah-compliant financial products. The idea is to automate the entire contractual process for Islamic finance institutions.Startups approved to offer Shariah-compliant financial products include the Dubai-based Blockchain startups include OneGram, Malaysia\u2019s HelloGold, and Islamic microfinance firm Blossom Finance from Indonesia.Certification on the blockchain might make halal certifications simpler. POCertify is a new dApp on the blockchain. It uses smart contracts technology to publish Halal certificates. Halal is the Arabic word for permissible, and, in this case, is mostly refers to food. Food classified as halal has to be certified in terms of several Islamic guidelines.\u201cBlockchain technology, together with Islamic principles, will digitally encrypt the Halal Certificate in its PDF format, and verify the Halal Certificate on the blockchain,\u201d explains founder Shabeer Shaik Abdurahaman, who specializes in Islamic fintech. If it is correctly verified, it proceeds to be used, and if not, the producer or supplier is not given the certificate.How Is Blockchain Being Used?Beyond food certification, Islamic financial institutions are using blockchain for the following reasons: smart contracts used for the management of profit sharing agreements, agency arrangements, and partnerships. verification of Islamic financial transactions for banks and customers to avoid conflicts, and facilitate client partnerships and increased transparency.integration with mobile technology in countries lacking legacy banking infrastructure.Blockchain may also be used in banking and transactions through smartphone apps while maintaining traceability and transparency of banking deals for retail clients.Will blockchain technology be integrated into Islamic finance?

In fact, a historic look at yearly lows reveals the massive Bitcoin price gains and how \u2018hodlers\u2019 are potentially created. BTC Price: A Different Perspective2017 was the year of all-time highs (ATH) values in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) 00, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, had an unparalleled bull-run resulting in an ATH value of about $20,000.2018, on the other hand, was a year of a prolonged bear market. The market\u2019s forerunner saw a steep decline of about 80 percent.While everyone seems to be fixating on the ATH and whether we\u2019ll reach them again, Twitter user @1stCrassCitizen, however, takes a different perspective. He writes:I\u2019ve been saying it for years. Don\u2019t look at ATH\u2019s, look at yearly lows.

Regardless of whether they bought at the bottom or at the yearly high, these \u2018hodlers\u2019 have still made at least 1000% returns in USD terms.Going further, Bictoinist recently reported that Bitcoin has increased in value with more than 82,000 percent in the last seven years, outperforming even stocks like Amazon (AMZN) over the period.The cryptocurrency\u2019s daily moving average is also 0.325 percent in the positive.Will 2018\u2019s $3,200 price set the new floor for hodlers moving forward?

However, according to a recent article by MIT Technology Review, that\u2019s exactly what they will become this year \u2014 as well as more useful.You don\u2019t have to be a crypto veteran to know that this industry is famously volatile. The highs and (mostly) lows of recent months are characteristic of the crypto space. An 80 percent drop in value from one year to the next is par for the course in this 10-year-old space. 80 percent increases in one month can also happen, just look at Ethereum.Dangerous, volatile, unstable, speculative\u2013these are all words you expect to hear when you mention cryptocurrency, but \u2018boring\u2019 doesn\u2019t usually appear. And yet, according to MIT, that\u2019s exactly what will happen in 2019:In 2017, blockchain technology was a revolution that was supposed to disrupt the global financial system. In 2018, it was a disappointment. In 2019, it will start to become mundane.2018 Was a Year of Disappointment \u2013 And ProgressWhile the focus for many has been on price throughout 2017 and 2018, a large chunk of the blockchain community has been getting on with business as usual. Yes, some of the magic may have left the blockchain space. That\u2019s only natural after so much over-promising and marketing hype.However, this year will see many excellent projects making good on their promises and delivering what they proposed in their ICOs. 2018 may not have been the best year for prices, but blockchain technology has seen more innovation than any other year. If you need evidence of that, look no further than the progress the Lightning Network has made in this image below.Lightning Network: January 2018 vs December 2018 pic.twitter.com/P6LWP1RRzr\u2014 Jameson Lopp (@lopp) December 24, 2018Institutions and Big Business Are Getting InAccording to the MIT article, if you want a sign that blockchains will finally start to bear fruit this year, look no further than the fact the both Walmart and Wall Street are getting in on the game. Walmart has been testing a private blockchain system for years and seeing success tracking foods around the world in the supply chain. In 2019, the global giant will make this system mandatory for its leafy green vegetable suppliers to join by Q3.Moreover, despite the cryptocurrency market displaying worrying lows and losses in 2018, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, ICE, is bringing Bakkt to the market in early 2019 after an incredible first round of funding. Bakkt just raised a sensational $182.5 million from big-name investors like Microsoft, Pantera Capital, and BCG.Fidelity is also throwing its hat into the ring with a custody service for crypto assets called Fidelity Digital Assets. Whatever the outcome of Bakkt, Fidelity, and crypto this year, blockchain technology is being taken extremely seriously by institutions. Smart Contracts to Be Used for Real-World IssuesEver since smart contracts came about, their potential for real-world use has been undeniable. But alongside that, the potential for great damage is also high. There are still many bugs in smart contracts that have to lead to huge losses in funds such as the Parity Wallet loophole.However, smart contract technology has been improving and several companies will be showcasing smart contracts in the real world this year.The problem of \u201cgarbage in garbage out\u201d (or in technical terms, having a trustworthy source of data in the form of an \u201coracle\u201d) has been solved by companies like Chainlink launching the first, \u201cprovably secure, decentralized oracle network\u201d ensuring the data is trustworthy using cryptography.We can expect to see smart contracts used in the legal field and at basic contract completion level this year. There\u2019s even the possibility of state-backed cryptocurrencies as eluded to by Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, as a way of accelerating financial inclusion.It\u2019s unlikely that FedCoin will happen next year. In fact, it\u2019s rather unlikely that it will happen at all when you consider that adding a central authority to cryptocurrencies rather defies the point in the first place. But with all the new projects launching in 2019\u2013actual working solutions and not just ideas\u2013real institutional funds and backing, blockchains may be getting boring but they are certainly going to start being useful.

Crypto Lenders Playing Both Sides of the FieldDuring the extended bear market of 2018, as layoffs soared, and fortunes hemorrhaged, lenders were rubbing their hands in glee. It seems everyone was borrowing; bulls to avoid selling coins at post-crash values, and bears, so they could short them.Most crypto-lending companies formed during the bull-run of 2017, offering a way to borrow cash against crypto-assets without selling them. When the market about-turned, so did the lenders role, who maintained and even extended profits without skipping a beat.BlockFi reports ten-fold growth in revenue and customer base. The owners of ETHLend have just opened an office in London and plan to expand into the US soon. And Salt lending is adding to its 80 employees on a monthly basis as revenue increases.HODLers vs. ShortersInstitutional investors wishing to borrow cryptocurrency can do so from companies like Genesis Capital, who have already issued $700 million in loans since their March 2018 launch. For around $1.2 million of fiat, they can take $1 million in bitcoin, paying yearly interest of 10-12 percent.As Bitcoinist reported, HODLer levels are growing, as seen by the increase in yearly price lows. Those who use their tokens as collateral for cash loans generally need a much larger buffer against falling prices. BlockFi typically asks for a $10,000 deposit of coins to release $5000 of fiat. Interest rates start at 7.9%If the collateral does fall in value, a customer may get a warning that holdings are at risk of being sold off. This allows the addition of more collateral to maintain the loan, or less often, for a customer to pay back the fiat and reclaim their collateral.Expansion And DiversificationCrypto-lending businesses, it seems, are prospering, and many plan to diversify their product offerings. BlockFi is working on bitcoin interest-bearing savings accounts and crypto loyalty cards. ETHLend is working with partners in Switzerland and Australia to expand their geographical footprint.As Stani Kulechov, CEO of their parent company Aave, says:Everything flies in the bull market, but true magic happens when it does well in a bear market.Is growth of crypto lending a good sign for the whole industry?

However, he\u2019s also concerned by actions of \u2018misguided\u2019 regulators. 2019: Finding the BottomVenture capitalist and co-founder of investment firm Union Square Ventures, has laid down his predictions on the overall state of the cryptocurrency market in 2019.The investor believes that we are currently in the process of bottoming out. However, he thinks that this would take much of 2019 but it will be followed by \u201csome bullish runs.\u201dI expect we will see some bullish runs, followed by selling pressures taking us back to retest the lows. I think this bottoming out process will end sometime in 2019 and we will slowly enter a new bullish phase in crypto.Unlike others who\u2019ve based their positive predictions on catalysts such as further market adoption, institutional money entering the market, infrastructure, and so forth, Wilson sees the premise of a new bullish run in the face of the results of promises made back in 2017.I think the catalyst for the next bullish phase will come as the result of some of the many promises made in 2017 coming to fruition in 2019 [\u2026] I think we will see a number of \u201cnext gen\u201d smart contract platforms ship and challenge Ethereum for leadership in this super important area of the crypto sector.Another area where Wilson thinks 2019 will bring \u2018meaningful progress\u2019 and further adoption is stablecoins. He\u2019s not alone on the matter.Bitcoinist reported earlier in November that CoinJar\u2019s co-founder Asher Tan also believes in the potential of stablecoins to solve the problem of volatility in the cryptocurrency space.Regulatory ConcernsThe venture capitalist also shares that there will be pressure on the cryptocurrency industry, in general. According to him, it will stem from \u2018misguided regulators\u2019.The area I am most concerned about are actions brought by misguided regulators who will take aim at high quality projects and harm them.Back in October, industry proponent Jeremy Allaire, CEO of investment application Circle, called for globally coordinated cryptocurrency regulations. At the same time, the Chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) J. Christopher Giancarlo urged regulators to apply a \u201cdo no harm\u201d approach to cryptocurrency legislation.Last but not least, Wilson thinks that scams, hacks, and overall failures are going to remain a \u201cdrag on the sector.\u201d However, he also holds that this is normal and \u2018always the case\u2019 with emerging tech.What do you think of Fred Wilson\u2019s prediction of the cryptocurrency industry\u2019s condition in 2019?

Ethereum leadership plans to accomplish this objective by minimizing blockchain energy consumption by 99 percent.\u2018Ethereum 2.0\u2019 PoS Blockchain Being Built From ScratchVitalik Buterin, inventor and co-founder of Ethereum, started 2019 by regaining Ethereum\u2019s position as the second largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of over USD 15.5 billion.However, Buterin admits that Ethereum mining now purportedly consumes more electricity than Iceland. Thus, to sustain or enhance its competitive advantage, Ethereum is aiming to reduce energy consumption by scraping its blockchain based on proof-of-work (PoW) and instead building an entirely new blockchain based on the proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm.In this regard, Vitalik says, \u201clatest ETH update should complete transactions using just 1% of the energy consumed today by replacing PoW with PoS.\u201dTestnet in 2019? Don\u2019t Hold Your BreathPeter Fairley, a contributor editor for Spectrum IEEE, writes that energy reduction has been part of Buterin\u2019s vision from the start, concurring that PoW consumes energy excessively.Buterin envisions that future blockchains will be based on PoS and sharding. Sharding is a database-partitioning technique that involves separating huge databases into smaller, faster and more manageable components, known as data shards.On December 10, 2018, Buterin tweeted:Blockchains of the future with proof of stake and sharding will be thousands of times more efficient, and so the efficiency sacrifices of putting things on a chain will become more and more acceptable.The Ethereum devs decided on the two-blockchain solution in June 2018 dubbed \u2018Ethereum 2.0.\u2019 Ethereum contributor Paul Hauner, a co-founder of Australian cybersecurity and blockchain-development firm Sigma Prime, and heads the development of the \u2018Lighthouse\u2019 Ethereum 2.0 software client, that uses the Rust code. He expects this app and others to be running PoS on testnets in early 2019.But due to multiple delays in the past and the complexity of the task at hand, may expect this new radical shift to Ethereum 2.0 to take time and it\u2019ll likely not see the light of day in 2019.\u201cIn October 2017, when mining time had already nearly doubled to 30 seconds, the Ethereum team reset the clock, delaying PoW\u2019s doomsday by about 12 months,\u201d Fairley notes. \u201cAnd they will likely hit snooze again shortly.\u201dWeiss Ratings echoed this sentiment, saying they won\u2019t be holding their breath, at least not in 2019.#ETH mining consumes roughly as much electricity as Iceland.

Whilst Medium has not confirmed the reason, several Twitter users have claimed previous account suspensions based on crypto-related content.Storm In A TeacupSo what can have incurred the wrath of Medium so much that they felt it necessary to wield the ban-hammer? Fortunately, the author reposted the article elsewhere, so we can read it and find out. Even more, fortunately, I\u2019m going to paraphrase it, so you don\u2019t need to bother reading it yourself.The article has the disclaimer that you may not agree with it, so are welcome to read something else instead. If only Medium allowed us the same freedom of choice to read it in the first place, eh?Let\u2019s begin\u2026Privacy is a fundamental human right, although government agencies are increasingly trying to curtail this in the name of security. Because some people use bitcoin for nefarious reasons, they want to monitor all use\u2026 but only for your own protection, of course.So how can we eschew their benevolent intentions and secure our own privacy?Keeping Your Privates PrivateThe article recommends always using cash for buying in/out and never using a service that requires AML/KYC. These regulations just tie your physical identity to your Bitcoin address and do little to prevent money laundering. In fact, as confirmed by Bitcoinist on a regular basis, the vast majority of money-laundering occurs through banks.The guide also stresses that the same Bitcoin address should never be used more than once.Reusing [Bitcoin] addresses is the virtual version of spreading an STDWhilst this is an amusing metaphor, it\u2019s hardly contentious, and pretty much standard advice. Oh, and as we\u2019re giving good advice; don\u2019t use wallets with Bloom filters, and do use an anonymity network or VPN.Medium Jumps on the \u2018Ban-Wagon\u2019?We then move on to the methods used to compromise your privacy, namely Bitcoin forensic analysis, and heuristics. Heuristics are essentially assumptions that are not perfectly correct, but good enough to use, in this case for identification and tracking.As these are just guesses, there are ways that we can make them unreliable, and minimize the risk. One of these that the article goes into in a great deal of detail is coin-mixing. It recommends staying away from centralized mixing services and gives some suggestions as to alternative CoinJoins.The guide sits somewhere between basic good advice and perhaps slight overcaution for most users. However, there is little in terms of content that could be considered contentious, or worthy of a suspension.This being said, the links in the article do all seem to hit pages with endless loading loops. Even typing in the website address to get to the homepage (or any page other than the re-posted article) suffers the same fate.It is possible that these \u2018questionable\u2019 links could have caused a suspension, and it is not recommended to click any of them. Nevertheless, there seems to be a growing trend towards de-platforming by PayPal, Patreon etc. and it would be sad if Medium was also taking this path.What other methods can you share for increasing Bitcoin privacy?

Worst Daily Plunge Since 2013Apple, one of the world\u2019s largest publicly traded companies, has lost around $65 billion of its market capitalization in a single day on January 3rd, 2019.

All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsYesterday afternoon, shortly after the markets closed Apple came out with a shocking report.Shares of the world\u2019s largest company fell about 7% in after-hours trading and are expected to open this morning with a huge gap down.At some level, just about every investor in the world who holds a stock portfolio has some exposure to Apple shares, that includes most pensions and investment portfolios in the world. Apple has already been under pressure from the tech rout but this new leg down bumps up the severity and further jeopardizes the entire market.It\u2019s not just stocks that are affected by this either. Shortly after Apple\u2019s announcement, there was some very peculiar activity in the currency market.The flash crash impacted almost all currencies but was felt strongest in the Japanese Yen. Japan is still closed for the holiday, so the thin liquidity, especially during the wee hours of the morning when most other countries are sleeping, was also said to have been a trigger for this flash crash.As you\u2019ll recall, the flash crash that happened in the British Pound on October 7th, 2016, also happened during the early morning Japanese session when volumes are lowest.Here we can see the scope of the crash in the USDJPY on three different time scales.Also, the second most affected currency seems to be the Turkish Lira. In this chart we can see the USDTRY repelling away from 200 day moving average (blue line), that it has been testing for a few weeks.Day 13As the US Government partial shutdown enters its 13th day, tensions couldn\u2019t be higher. A meeting between President Trump and the Democrats ended very poorly yesterday, with neither side willing to compromise over the budget.Today will probably be more of the same illiquid flight to safety markets. but you never know really and a turnaround or even a flattening is always possible.Tomorrow, we\u2019ll receive the monthly jobs report from the United States. This oughta be fun.Crypto SetupGains across most of the popular cryptoassets have been rather mild lately. While it\u2019s good to see bitcoin holding steady, we\u2019re actually starting to see a side of the market that is more typical during a bull run.Surges in alt coins are suddenly getting more common. Though I can\u2019t quite explain what happened to Paragon, a cannabis-related alt coin, that went from 16 cents to more than $10 and back within a few hours on Tuesday. This could very well be a product of an illiquid market, similar to what we saw above.However, more serious projects like Ethereum, EOS, and Iota have actually seen sustainable double-digit gains this last week.What\u2019s becoming clear is that there\u2019s a large disconnect between cryptoasset pricing and industry growth. My comments to this effect were covered by Bloomberg yesterday, and I\u2019m now considering adding \u201cdigital diehard\u201d to my bio.Kidding aside. We\u2019ve tried to call the bottom of this market several times now without success, so I\u2019ll reserve my predictions on that front. But, what I can say is that crypto has evolved from virtually nothing into an entire budding industry within 10 short years.

Based on the Mimblewimble protocol, the brand-new cryptocurrency has a few lofty goals, and among them is to make cryptocurrency transactions \u201cdrastically\u201d more confidential. Another noteworthy aspect about the cryptocurrency that could end up rivaling Zcash and Monero is that Beam is the first ever project to implement the \u2018Mimblewimble\u2019 protocol. This was a widely applauded blockchain protocol proposed anonymously in 2016 (sound familiar?) with the goal of bringing privacy back to crypto transactions. If it all sounds like a bunch of Harry Potter Hocus Pocus to you, that\u2019s probably because it is. The Mimblewimble protocol derived its name from a spell in the children\u2019s books that prevents people from spilling secrets.Beam: First Project to Use the Mimblewimble ProtocolThe main premise behind the anonymous Mimblewimble protocol is to offer crypto transactions that are significantly more confidential than those made with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or even \u201cprivacy\u201d coins like Monero. Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin in particular, originally emerged as a way of allowing for privacy-oriented value storage and transfer. However, as time went by, it became clear that Bitcoin was not as anonymous as people thought. Data leaks could easily lead to the mapping of public addresses using blockchain forensics. To tackle these issues, cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash appeared on the scene, but not without their own issues. To start with, while these coins have a strong inclination toward privacy, not all their transactions are ultimately private. And both blockchains face similar scalability issues. Beam, then, is setting its sights on becoming the ultimate \u2018storage-of-value\u2019 and payment cryptocurrency, continuing the revolution set out by Bitcoin, through its focus on anonymity. After all, true confidentiality and scalability for financial transactions is a requirement not just of institutions and investors, but individuals as well. Both of these factors are considered necessary for true mainstream adoption of crypto to occur.CEO of Beam Alexander Zaidelson said:Sovereignty over one\u2019s own information is a basic human right, and applies to all aspects of life, and especially to financial transactions\u2026 Everyone, from the largest institutional investors to the individual cryptocurrency holder, should have the right to decide on what to disclose and to whom.Combining Mimblewimble with Other Features Beam will combine Mimblewimble with additional features in order to offer true privacy to users on its network. The Beam blockchain remains a distributed ledger that allows for decentralized validation of transactions. However, no observer can obtain any private information about the sender, receiver, or amount transacted.Thanks to the Mimblewimble Transaction Cut-through feature, the blockchain size is expected to be between 3-10 times smaller than Bitcoin (if the same amount of usage is taken into consideration).Another interesting feature about Beam is that users will have the option of opting in for audits of their accounts and transactions, which could be extremely useful for tax and accounting purposes.Beam is brand-new on the mainnet and, according to its creators\u2019 announcement on Medium, likely to contain bugs, defects, and errors while they work on implementing improvements.As developers begin to add key features like atomic swaps with Bitcoin, mobile wallet, pool support, and bitcoin wallet integration, Beam has the potential to attract traditional crypto users that left the market due to privacy concerns, or who fail to see coins like Monero as an attractive option. Financial institutions are also likely to see the value in a blockchain that allows for private transactions for its customers.Can Beam and MimbleWimble rival privacy-focused coins like Monero and ZCash?

And private citizens will come to appreciate the inherent value of Bitcoin, as their ability to discreetly hold and transfer value evaporates once cash goes the way of the dodo.Bitcoin has begun the second decade of its life with something of a public image problem, which contrasts its strong technical robustness. With prices hovering around $3800, mainstream perceptions, fuelled by media hype and high-profile naysayers, often consider Bitcoin as a \u2018popped\u2019 financial bubble.The Essential Need For PrivacyGiven its young age, however, the potential for adoption and development is endless, advocates including Hayes argue. \u201cBitcoin is still very much an experiment,\u201d he continued in the Times piece. However, after 10 years of operation, the Bitcoin protocol has not been hacked \u2014 despite offering what\u2019s effectively the biggest \u2018bug bounty\u2019 in software history. Bitcoin is an amazing achievement of disparate private individuals working together towards a common goal.Aside from the anniversary, BitMEX\u2019s publicity move comes at a pertinent time. Spiraling global debt, crackdowns on financial and other freedoms in various countries, along with dubious approaches to cryptocurrency regulation, continue to fuel the desire for a private, non-corruptible way to transact.Put simply, Hayes summarizes Bitcoin\u2019s prospective impact on humanity as \u201cperhaps society\u2019s best hope for a private form of electronic money.\u201d\u201c\u2026Privacy, I argue, is an important part of a well-functioning society,\u201d added.

In May 2018, Bitcoinist reported on the uproar caused by new KYC requirements introduced at the time. Many legacy account holders felt the move broke several assurances provided by the company in late 2017.For Circle, the steps taken have yielded fruit especially in the area of customer support. The blog post revealed a 99.5 percent decrease in the number of open tickets since the acquisition.In 2018, the Goldman Sachs-backed Circle also acquired SeedInvest as part of its drive to become a regulated broker-dealer. With tightening regulations in the US crypto landscape, startups like Circle and Coinbase have been pursuing regulatory approval to expand their cryptocurrency product catalogs.Stable Coin Launch and Company GrowthCircle also ventured into the stablecoin arena with the launch of USD Coin (USDC). This development led to the creation of the CENTRE consortium, a joint venture with San Francisco-based exchange giant, Coinbase.According to the announcement, USDC is now the second-largest fiat collateralized stablecoin after Tether with a market capitalization more than $280 million.

[\u2026] We are proud to partner with forward-thinking governments and officials like Ohio and Treasurer Mandel to help usher in an era of trust through technology for our nation\u2019s essential financial systems.Earlier in November, Bitcoinist reported that Overstock\u2019s share price soared as the company announced plans to sell its retail-oriented business and to focus on previously acquired blockchain startups.\u2018Ahead of Its Time\u2019Paying taxes with Bitcoin in Ohio became possible in late November 2018 at OhioCrypto.com.According to State Treasurer John Mandel, who pioneered the idea, Overstock\u2019s move to pay its taxes with the cryptocurrency is \u2018ahead of its time\u2019:We applaud Overstock for becoming the first national brand in America to register to pay taxes via cryptocurrency. Their embrace of blockchain technology was ahead of its time and we\u2019re proud to have them join OhioCrypto.com.In an interview for Fortune, Mandel also added that paying taxes with Bitcoin reveals certain financial advantages. According to him, taxpayers who use credit cards pay 2.5 percent service fees, while those who use Bitcoin will only incur a fee of 1 percent. Early filers like Overstock, however, won\u2019t incur any fees at all.What do you think of Overstock paying part of its state business tax in Ohio using Bitcoin?

Though the practical applications for this are virtually unlimited, one of the most obvious is the ability to revolutionize the financial markets. At the moment, just about all global markets rely on a central authority.The ability to create a digital token that represents a financial asset is just around the corner. In fact, an exchange called DX has just announced that they will be the first to deliver tokenized stocks starting next week.As a regulated broker, DX plans to hold onto the shares and issue the tokens. The tokens can then be traded freely and cheaply by anyone in the world 24/7.This is only the beginning though. Over the next decade, we could very well see the tokenization of the entire financial markets. Essentially, anything that has value and can be traded can also be represented as a digital token and traded on a blockchain.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsShutdown: Day 14Jobs Report TodayCrypto CorrelationsDark Side of BitcoinPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of January 4th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsStocks remain under pressure but are seeing a bit of a rebound today. Going into the 14th day of the partial US government shutdown, stocks are at a critical juncture.They\u2019ve managed to push off the lows last Wednesday, but so far this year have mostly been seeing modest declines. It would take a lot of gusto to muster a rally back to the highs at this point but on the other hand if we start testing the lows again it would certainly make a lot of investors nervous.Today we\u2019ll get the monthly jobs report from the United States, which is expected to bring a solid announcement of 179,000 jobs added in December and a wage growth of 0.3%.The closer we get to those numbers the more comfortable Wall Street will be. Weak job growth numbers could start to show cracks in the economy but stronger than expected numbers could be even worse as they could entice the Fed to tighten their monetary policy even quicker.Bitcoin Lining up with Stocks?With the recent turbulence in the traditional markets, it seems like a fitting time to check how crypto is lining up with traditional assets.Here we can see bitcoin in black, the S&P500 stock index in blue, the USD in green, and Gold in orange.I think the trends are pretty clear from this graph above, but if we want to analyze the correlations of these markets over time, we can use something like the graph below.This shows bitcoin\u2019s correlation to the USD (Blue), the US stock market (grey), and gold (purple).The numbers here are very small. A high of 0.15 and a low of negative 0.1 shows that there\u2019s virtually no correlation. However, I think that we can start to look at direction as an indicator of market sentiment.Notice how the correlation between bitcoin and gold (purple line) has risen sharply over the last month as both gold and bitcoin rise together.If we do continue to see the stocks sliding and bitcoin rising, that grey line would plummet. Maybe then bitcoin might be seen by some as a safe hedge against stock declines, but we\u2019re still far away from that.Dark Side of BitcoinI\u2019d like to say congratulations to China for becoming the first to land a spacecraft on the dark side of the moon. Perhaps it\u2019s fitting that this event comes while bitcoin is seeing new lows and calls of \u201cto the moon\u201d are certainly shrouded in darkness at the moment.Still, we have explored the possibility of \u2018lunar analysis\u2019 on bitcoin in the past and it\u2019s certainly something I feel open to. After all, if the moon can influence the tide and people\u2019s moods, then why not the markets?To this point, I\u2019d like to present this year\u2019s lunar schedule. We should probably check in throughout the year to see if there\u2019s any effect.

Bitcoinist | Jan 05, 2019 | 10:00 Share Tweet Send Share Understanding the tremendous potential for expansion of the multi-billion dollar international market, as well as the issues that are currently crippling it, GG World Lottery intends to bring the much-needed solution while enabling its STO participants to benefit greatly. Introducing unparalleled blockchain-backed technology and multiple ways to earn serious revenues, the project has already created a serious hype around it.A Multi-Billion Dollar Market2017 alone saw upwards of $273 billion being sold in lottery tickets throughout the world. This vast market, however, is crippled by serious issues such as the lack of new technology, ineffective marketing strategies, and the overall struggle to progress and adapt to the new reality.Legacy lotteries fail to abide by the growing requirements of millennials and younger generations who are increasingly relying on their mobile devices for information and further engagement.GG World Lottery puts a damper on all of these by bringing a multi-layered approach which combines the integration of blockchain-based technology as well as an unparalleled marketing strategy which has already been put in motion.It\u2019s the first lottery project which will implement a True Random Number Generator based on the blockchain. This will guarantee that the numbers are drawn randomly based on the quantum physics principle of natural randomness of the world.GGCOIN: Passive Income OpportunityApart from attempting to rectify a lot of the issues which are currently crippling the market, GG World Lottery is a project which is built around the mind for participants.In order to take part in the STO, users have to purchase the GGCOIN token. All token holders, however, are automatically entitled to an array of benefits and provided with multiple ways to earn a serious return on their investments.Most notable, GGCOIN holders receive the right to a lifetime revenue share which is based on every GG World Lottery Jackpot won. In other words, whenever the jackpot is won, each GGCOIN token holder will win with it. Dividends are paid on a quarterly basis and they depend on the number of jackpot wins throughout the given period. Also, the more GGCOIN tokens are sold, the higher the dividend will be.Apart from that, users are also able to take part in a lucrative affiliate system, to support charities and good causes, and to participate in state of the art lotteries \u2013 all of which creates a serious hype around GG World Lottery\u2019s STO.$5.5 Million Already RaisedAll of the above has enabled the project to raise more than $5.5 million in a fairly short period of time after beginning its STO. Unlike other projects, though, GG World Lottery has already created its product and has begun laying down the infrastructure for its success.Hence, the money will be used to realize the project\u2019s ambitious marketing plan, to secure prizes, advertising, and all that is associated with the rollout of the first lotteries based in the country of Zambia.The funds which have been raised will enable the team to support the country\u2019s charities, football teams, set up and organize local offices, and to roll out its first localized ads, to secure prizes, and to handle legal work and accounting.Not only will all this help for the further success of the project \u2014 but it will also propel a positive change in the local economy of Zambia, which will set the stage for further expansion of GG World Lottery.If you want to become a part of this exciting project, you can do it on the official website.

Many predictions last year didn\u2019t envisage the enormous bear market that characterized the year, with Bitcoin dropping more than 80 percent. Weiss Ratings has published its outlook for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2019.Increased Adoption and New ATH for BitcoinAccording to Weiss Ratings, 2019 will herald increased adoption for Bitcoin. The international rating agency expects more people to consider the top-ranked cryptocurrency as a store of value. The expected result is BTC firmly establishing its status as digital gold.The forecast report also suggested that BTC price 00 could reach a new all-time high (ATH) in 2019. This prediction comes from the apparent cyclical nature of Bitcoin price action with major bear market declines followed by new ATH.Back in December, Bitcoinist reported on the call by Weiss Ratings that prices reached a low enough level for investors to load up on BTC.2019: Year of the XRP Flippening?Weiss Ratings also predicts a significant year for XRP 00 especially in its pursuit of cornering the global payment ecosystem. While identifying the progress made by XRP and Stellar, the rating agency highlighted XRP as having the potential to compete with SWIFT.Ripple spent most of 2018 extending its network of applications related to the banking sector, inking partnerships along with way.For Weiss Ratings, XRP could on the back of increased utility displace BTC from its perch at the top of the cryptocurrency market capitalization chart. For a brief period in 2018, XRP overtook Ethereum as the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.This forecast represents a shift for Weiss Ratings given that in 2018, the agency said BTC would lose 50 percent of its market share to Ethereum. Indeed, most of the talk about the \u201cflippening\u201d has almost always been about Ethereum upstaging Bitcoin. However, the decline in the ICO arena seems to have negatively impacted such a possibility.Mixed Bag for Altcoins in 2019As far as the rest of the altcoin market goes, Weiss Ratings predicts a mixed bag of fortune with some rising to prominence and others fade into obscurity. The rating agency says \u201cBTC-like\u201d coins like Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are destined to fail due to the absence of innovative use-cases for such cryptocurrencies.On the other hand, projects like EOS and Cardano will usher in a paradigm shift in Internet technology, giving birth to Web 3.0. Also, Weiss envisages a shakeup in the top ten rankings with new entrants such as Holochain and Hedera Hashgraph.Do you agree with the predictions mentioned above?

This week saw them shilling their Gemini cryptocurrency exchange by spamming New York City with \u2018regulations are good\u2019 adverts.Crypto Needs Rules\u2026 But Does It?The message that the adverts purportedly push, is that regulatory measures lead to a future cryptocurrency market without the chaos.Slogans such as \u2018The Revolution Needs Rules\u2019, \u2018Money Has A Future\u2019, and \u2018Crypto Without Chaos\u2019 have sprung up seemingly everywhere.So the twins think New York has been holding off \u2018hodling\u2019 because crypto is such a terrifyingly anarchic place. Selling \u2018regulation\u2019 as the antidote to such disorder will surely make New York overcome its fear of the cryptocurrency rollercoaster? Right?If Only There Were A Regulated\u2026 Oh, Hang On.As luck would have it, there is a regulated crypto exchange in New York and it belongs to the Winklevii.Most exchanges including the P2P LocalBitcoins platform ceased trading in the entire state following New York\u2019s requirement for a BitLicense. But Gemini managed to snag themselves one of those back in 2015. In fact, they are still one of just a handful of companies to do so.So crypto-wary New Yorkers, who have been thus far put off by a lack of regulation in the market, now have their safe-space amid the \u2018chaotic\u2019 world of cryptocurrencies.You can even buy some regulated USD-pegged Gemini dollars and never worry about checking the price again!Unfortunately, if you\u2019d still like to trade actual cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, regulations won\u2019t really insulate you from getting \u2018rekt\u2019 \u2013 if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.Meanwhile, \u2018non-regulated\u2019 exchanges can kick rocks. You see, getting approved for a BitLicense in NYC is like getting a taxi cab medallion before Uber became a thing. The barrier to entry for the competition is simply too high.In other words, regulations protect Gemini above all, keeping the \u2018non-regulated\u2019 competitors at bay. Meanwhile, users must hand over their personal information to Gemini in order to access the platform in accordance with know-your-customer (KYC) rules.So who\u2019s actually protecting whom here?Finally, A Regulated Place To Buy, Sell, And Store CryptoWell, that\u2019s the final nail in the coffin of non-regulated exchanges\u2026 although this guy still looks fairly non-plussed.Wait\u2026 What? Store? I take it they won\u2019t be fans of Proof of keys?It seems that the Winkleshakers believe New Yorkers will be so impressed with their BitLicense that cryptocurrency holders will just flock to hand over their private keys.Right! That\u2019s just a step too far. This \u2018sanitization\u2018 of Bitcoin for selling to the masses goes against at the biggest reason it was created: getting rid of middlemen. Namely, the government but also the squeaky clean, white-teethed, all-American Suckerberg-victims who\u2019ll have the ability to freeze your funds at a whim.Even more importantly, running your own full node is the only way to enforce the rules \u2013 the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. This makes it\u2019s possible to use Bitcoin by not having to trust anyone, including the Winklevii.Don\u2019t worry.

It also features a larger screen.The most notable new feature, however, is the fact that users will be able to connect the wallet to mobile devices using the Ledger Live mobile app. The goal of the company is to increase mobility as hardware wallets typically connect over USB, which isn\u2019t exactly mobile-friendly.The Ledger Nano X costs $119 and it is already available for pre-order on the company\u2019s official website. Shipping is set to start in March.The Ledger Live app is already available for download for iOS, Windows, and Linux OS and it will be available for iOS and Android on January 28th.The app will allow users to create new accounts or to import existing ones. It\u2019s also supposed to make sending and receiving cryptocurrencies a lot easier while enabling users to monitor their portfolios from a single place.Notes Eric Larchev\u00eaque, CEO at Ledger:The Ledger Nano X includes all of what you loved about your Nano S, but with new and improved major features. [\u2026] With its Bluetooth connectability and increased capacity, the Ledger Nano X provides an enhanced user experience while delivering the mobility and state-of-the-art security that customers expect from Ledger. It is exciting to be recognized by CES as the go-to leader for securing crypto assets.What About Security?Hardware wallets typically connect over USB. As such, adding Bluetooth to the Nano X could be considered a bit controversial because a wireless connection can increase the risk of unauthorized access.According to the official website, however, the device offers top-notch security, isolating the user\u2019s private keys inside a certified secure element (CC EAL 5+). This is the same chip used in credit cards and passports.Additionally, the hardware-level PIN protections, as well as the limited range of connectivity via Bluetooth, should, in theory, mitigate the risks.However, back in December, a research team published a presentation on how to hack cryptocurrency hardware wallets, including the Trezor One, Ledger Nano S, and Ledger Blue.Immediately after that, Ledger came up with an official statement, refuting all reported vulnerabilities, and reassuring users that their \u201ccrypto assets are still secure on your Ledger device.\u201dWhat do you think of the Ledger Nano X and the new Bluetooth-enabled mobile connection?

The company notes, however, that payments may not be the best use-case for a complex technology like blockchain.Houston, We Don\u2019t Have Lift OffMajor consulting company McKinsey & Company has published an article on the current issues faced by blockchain technology as a whole.The firm argues that all through 2017 and 2018 the industry has seen an influx of investments from both venture capital companies and major corporations.Indeed, blockchain-based projects have raised upwards of $21 billion in 2018 according to data from CoinSchedule. However, according to McKinsey, little progress has been made given the publicity and money poured into it:The bottom line is that despite billions of dollars of investment, and nearly as many headlines, evidence for a practical scalable use for blockchain is thin on the ground.The consulting firm holds that as an infant technology, blockchain is still relatively complex, expensive, unstable, and unregulated. It opines that the industry is currently in stage 1 of its development when investment is supposed to bear fruit in the form of a product being brought to market.However, McKinsey notes that the industry is failing to emerge past that pioneering stage into further market expansion and adoption.One of the reasons for this, especially for \u201cblockchain players in the payments segment\u201d is that the technology is not really needed as it\u2019s not the simplest solution.Occam\u2019s razor is the problem-solving principle that the simplest solution tends to be the best. On that basis blockchain\u2019s payments use cases may be the wrong answerIt\u2019s worth noting that this doesn\u2019t seem to be the position of MIT. Bitcoinist reported on a recent article by MIT Technology Review, which expects 2019 to be the year when blockchain projects will start to bear fruit and become \u2018boring.\u2019Niche ApplicationsMeanwhile, McKinsey & Company, considers blockchain technology to have practical value in other areas.Examples are found in insurance, supply chains, and capital markets, in which distributed ledgers can tackle pain points including inefficiency, process opacity, and fraud.Additionally, the company believes that the technology appeals to certain industries, which are oriented to modernization.In addition, blockchain holds reputational value or perhaps PR value (at least for the time being) as it signals to shareholders that a company is striving to innovate.What do you think of McKinsey & Company\u2019s take on blockchain technology?

This has been evidenced time and again throughout history. The beheading of King Louis XVI in the Place de la R\u00e9volution just one of many examples.Uprising and protest flow through the veins of the French. The country famous for its baguettes, struggling artists, and freedom of speech. The government ups the price of oil? Truck drivers begin to overturn their loads and barricade the streets. The authorities decide to raise taxes and print money? Protestors start setting the streets on fire and smashing windows and monuments. Yes, the French tolerance for bullshit is definitely next to zero.The Paris ProtestsLast month, Macron\u2019s government faced chaos and fighting on the streets for over their willful decision to hike taxes and print money eroding the value of French people\u2019s wealth and making cryptocurrencies like bitcoin all the more relevant.In the last round of protests, men and women in yellow vests abounded sporting the words \u201cBuy Bitcoin\u201d a currency defined by mathematics and markets and not by governments or institutions. Given the infamous French spirit, it\u2019s not surprising that bitcoin should go down well here. In fact, French tobacco shops are expected to start selling bitcoins along with their cigarettes and lottery tickets this month, and the world\u2019s largest hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger is French.Spreading the Word Through ArtIn a country famous for freedom of expression (remember the controversial cartoons from Charlie Hebdo that resulted in the mass murder of most of its team?) it seems particularly fitting that they should be spreading the word about bitcoin through art.

Last week, we put out a poll on Twitter to see how crypto people see their role in the ecosystem. Perhaps not surprisingly, the number one response by far was HODL.Of the many comments on the thread, it seems that a number of people couldn\u2019t quite limit themselves to a single response with the most common comment being \u201call of the above.\u201dOne thing that was pleasantly surprising about these results was the sheer amount of people out there who are actively contributing and building crypto. Assuming that half of those who voted \u201cother\u201d are also part of growing the industry, which is evident in the comments, that\u2019s more than 1000 respondents who are laying the groundwork for a decentralized future.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsShutdown: Day 17Some ChartsBitcoin Surge 6% in 30 minutesPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of January 7th. All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsBy the afternoon, financial markets should be back to full strength. For the first time this year, investors are back at their desks and ready to trade.Today we head into the 17th day of the US government\u2019s partial shutdown and despite Vice President Pence working through the weekend with house democrats, we still don\u2019t seem to have a solution in sight.The trade talks between the US and China will also resume today. The current truce is set to last at least until March 1st, which doesn\u2019t leave a lot of time to strike a deal.One more thing worth mentioning today is the fantastic jobs report that came out on Friday. Analysts were forecasting a mediocre 179,000 jobs added to the US economy in December. Instead, the number came out at an astonishing 312,000.The average hourly wages also rose a bit more than expected, which may end up confirming what some economists are saying about the economy getting a bit too hot.TechnicalsBoth oil and gold are making some strong moves up while the US dollar falls below support. Here we can see the black sticky stuff testing that very round level of $50 a barrel for the first time since it broke below three weeks ago.As expected, gold did see a pullback before reaching $1,300 an ounce. The pullback coincided with the excitement surrounding Friday\u2019s job numbers. However, the markets still have many worries that were not allayed by that report.With the idea that the Fed may now be getting less aggressive on interest rate hikes, the US Dollar is also coming under pressure. Here we can see the buck gaining throughout most of 2018, but not seeing a pullback.Bitcoin SpikeYesterday afternoon the crypto markets were delightfully surprised by a sudden surge in bitcoin of roughly 6.5% in less than 30 minutes. Now, it\u2019s not uncommon for this type of sudden spike to occur in the crypto markets but what was interesting is that the spike took us above $4,000 per coin.Even though $4,000 is a nice round number it doesn\u2019t necessarily represent any sort of significant psychological level. If we zoom out, and as we\u2019ve been discussing for a few weeks now, we can see that the overall range that we\u2019re in is from $3,000 to $5,000 per coin.So we\u2019re now at the halfway mark in the middle of the broader range.It should also be noted that one of the major crypto exchanges Bitfinex will be down for maintenance over the next few hours, which could affect liquidity in the market and possibly make things even more volatile.Wishing you an amazing week ahead!This content is provided for information and educational purposes only and should not be considered to be investment advice or recommendation.Past performance is not an indication of future results.

After remaining around those levels for around 18 hours, a U-turn set in, the price declining below $3800 before correcting to current levels around $4000. The reason for the fresh volatility, commentators have since speculated on social media, was a single transaction. According to Twitter account Whale Alerts, which publishes automated notices whenever large Bitcoin transactions occur, one investor moved 2521 BTC ($10.1 million) off cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp to a private wallet Sunday.Long-Term Downward TrendsThis, Forbes notes, in turn took the day\u2019s Bitcoin trade volume to a new high for 2019.\u201cA surge of 6.5 percent in 30 minutes is not entirely uncommon for bitcoin and could very well be caused by a single large order on an exchange or even by a lack of liquidity in the market,\u201d the publication quoted UK-based trading platform eToro analyst Mati Greenspan as saying.What\u2019s interesting about this move is that it did bring us above the $4000 level and so far is holding onto the gains.Despite the temporary dip since Greenspan\u2019s comments, the Bitcoin price remains around $200 clear of its previous levels, which it had traded at since the beginning of the month. Opinions about the future are mixed, with some traders continuing to claim further significant downside is due for BTC/USD, possibly taking the pair as low as $1300 or beyond.

The platform is a consortium with participants such as Roger Ver (Bitcoin.com CEO), B2C2, Trading Technologies, and Alameda Research among others.Bitcoin Futures Trading on CoinFLEXAccording to Bloomberg, CoinFLEX plans to offer futures contracts for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum. Like Bakkt (owned by Intercontinental Exchange), CoinFLEX\u2019s offerings are physically-backed contracts.According to CoinFLEX CEO, Mark Lamb, settling futures contracts in the underlying cryptocurrency asset improves trust. Speaking to Bloomberg on the prospects of cryptocurrency futures trading, Lamb said:Crypto derivatives could become an order of magnitude larger than spot markets and the main thing that\u2019s holding back that growth is the lack of physical delivery. Volumes are reduced because of a problem of trust when it comes to cash-settled trades.For Lamb, there is great potential for expansion within the cryptocurrency futures market. According to the CoinFLEX CEO, the crypto futures arena should be able to grow to 20 times the size of the spot trading market as is the case for other asset classes. Presently, both markets handle approximately the same volume of daily transactions.One unique detail of the CoinFLEX offering is that contracts will trade against Tether (USDT), the most popular stablecoin, which is pegged against the U.S. dollar. Apart from Tether, CoinFLEX also plans to launch a contract that will trade opposite Circle\u2019s USD Coin; another stablecoin.At the expiration of the contracts, traders who hold long positions will receive Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Bitcoin Cash while traders who hold short positions will receive USDT depending on the performance of the contract.Offshore Incorporation to Avoid Stricter Regulations Despite offering physically delivered Bitcoin futures, CoinFLEX will not come into direct competition with a platform like Bakkt. The reason for this is because it is incorporated offshore, allowing the platform to offer its product to a more global market except for highly regulated markets like the U.S. and the U.K.When pressed about competition from the likes of Bakkt, CME, and CBOE, Lamb highlighted the fact that U.S.-based crypto Bitcoin futures trading accounts for only a tiny portion of the market. Most of the global BTC futures trading takes place in the offshore and Asian theater.The primary reason for this disparity stems from the fact that markets like the U.S. remain highly regulated. Thus U.S.-based futures exchanges cannot compete with the reach of their counterparts based offshore or in Asia. The CoinFLEX chief believes BTC futures trading doesn\u2019t require the same level of stringent regulations like the spot trading market.With a focus on the Asian market, the platform will also be eyeing a move to compete with BitMEX, which has a sizeable presence in the region. Where the latter offers leverage of up to 100 times on specific contracts, CoinFLEX caps its offering at a leverage of 20 times.Do you think CoinFLEX will be able to compete with the likes of BitMEX and Bakkt?

For Delia, the government\u2019s silence is in stark contrast to its claim of striving to make Malta \u2018the global blockchain island.\u2019According to the Malta Independent, the government is taking steps to improve the regulatory landscape of the country\u2019s local cryptocurrency arena. Most of these efforts are coming through the Parliamentary Secretariat for Financial Services, Digital Economy, and Innovation.For the Secretariat, the focus is on creating an enabling environment for all stakeholders in the market to thrive. Thus, the government says it is trying to balance regulations with protection for investors.In 2018, the Mediterranean Island nation rose to prominence as a preferred destination for many cryptocurrency companies. Exchange platforms, in particular, chose to move their businesses to the country. Many of these platforms claimed unfavorable regulations in their previous locations as the reason for the move.Binance, OKEx, BitBay, and Zebpay were among some of the prominent exchanges to make the move in 2018. This influx of high-volume trading platforms catapulted the tiny nation to the top of the global cryptocurrency trading volume charts.Regulating the Local Cryptocurrency IndustryIn mid-2018, Malta became the first nation to provide \u2018legal certainty\u2019 for cryptocurrencies. The nation\u2019s parliament passed three bills into law as part of efforts to firm up crypto regulations in the country.Both Binance and OKEx signed agreements with the Maltese Stock Exchange (MSX) to create regulated security token exchange platforms. The move formed part of the growing appeal of security tokens that gained a lot of steam in 2018.Do you think that there are any merits to Delia\u2019s claims of inaction by the government concerning cryptocurrency?

Bitcoin Price: Market OverviewAt last, the bulls made a strong move but it is not as convincing as it could be. Regardless of what a weekly and monthly chart show, bullish analysts were clearly excited by this upside move and the press is hot with stories about trend reversals and a bullish start to 2019. 4-Hour ChartAs the 4-hour chart shows, a break above the psychological resistance at $4,000 took place but a more convincing move would be to see follow through or consolidation that leads to a move above $4,240 over the next 48-hours.Failure to break above this level should be a point of concern and in spite of all the bullish, \u2018trend reversal\u2019 talk and general investment optimism that comes with the arrival or a new year. Traders should remain realistic and recall that a bird\u2019s eye view of the weekly and monthly chart for BTC/USD and nearly every other cryptocurrency shows the market still in the firm grasp of bears. At the time of writing bitcoin price 00 appears to be finding support at $3,990, after visiting this region thrice. A sharp bear cross between the 5 and 10-MA can be clearly viewed and for the short-term Bitcoin needs to gain above $4,030 to maintain bullish momentum. Traders would do well to keep to the basics and reference the 5, 10, 20 and 50 moving averages, RSI, Stoch, MACD, heck, even the Bollinger Band indicator to confirm any bullish setups before engaging with bitcoin, and of course, use a stop loss. Bitcoin is still more unpredictable than undetonated ordinance from WWII so swimming naked and over-exuberant trading is not advised. To end things on a positive note (at least for bulls), the BTC/USD Shorts chart shows a considerable reduction in shorts so some of the overhead pressure has been removed for the next attempt Bitcoin makes at $4,100. BTC-USD ShortsIn the event that Bitcoin price is able to overtake $4,088 and $4,241, $4,415 would be the next crucial resistance level to tackle. As mentioned earlier, traders should remain cautious and curb their enthusiasm as any Bitcoin price under $6,500 is just a lower high, so there\u2019s still plenty of work to do.

Ginko has in recent times appeared on various Russian media platforms clamoring for the adoption of Bitcoin as a haven asset.Commenting on the issue, Ginko said:US sanctions may be mitigated only through Bitcoin use. Because of US sanctions, Russia\u2019s elite is forced to dump US assets and US dollars and invest hugely into Bitcoins. The central bank of Russia sits on $466 billion of reserves and has to diversify in case there are limited opportunities to do it (in the future).Cutting Dollar Dependence Amid New U.S. SanctionsAlong with China, Iran, and Venezuela, Russia is exploring ways to reduce its US Dollar dependence. Back in November 2018, Russian President; Vladimir Putin, declared that in the wake of new sanctions, the country had no choice but to cut down on its use of the Dollar in international trade.At the time, President Putin said:We have no goal of moving away from the Dollar. It\u2019s the dollar that\u2019s moving away from us. Those making such decisions are not shooting themselves in the foot, but somewhere more delicate, further up the body.According to Ginko, the Kremlin will, beginning in February 2018, look for ways to diversify its reserves. Ginko has in recent times appeared on various Russian media platforms clamoring for the adoption of Bitcoin as a haven asset.If the Russian government and the elite class invest massively in Bitcoin, the price of the asset could experience a sudden upward surge. Such a situation occurred in 2018 when wealthy Chinese citizens reportedly moved money into BTC in the wake of an accelerated currency devaluation by Beijing.Meanwhile, the Kremlin has been stocking up on non-digital gold as a shield against economic sanctions. Reports indicate the government is selling U.S. government debt in exchange for the precious metal. By August 2018, Russia had already tripled its gold reserve as it gears up for renewed economic tussles with the U.S.Such is the extent of Russia\u2019s gold-gobbling that global gold purchasing figures reached a three-year high in November 2018. The Kremlin is also pursuing closer economic ties with China to create a new payment system independent of the Dollar.Will massive Bitcoin investment by the Kremlin lead to any surge in the price of Bitcoin?

Many expect him to declare a state of emergency in order to circumvent Congress in getting funding for the border wall.Market volatility has come down a bit from the extreme highs of December but is still quite elevated.Ethereum Fork!So, there\u2019s been a lot of confusion here and I\u2019m very glad to cut right through this one for you and clarify.First, some background\u2026 We\u2019ve discussed already that the Ethereum blockchain is about to see a major upgrade. The name of this upgrade is Constantinople and it is scheduled for on or around January 16th.Constantinople will be implemented as a hard fork on Ethereum. If you\u2019re not 100% sure how forks work, please review this short explanation now.In this upcoming case, the Ethereum upgrade has been widely embraced by the community and until now there have been no major players protesting Constantinople. So most likely it will be a smooth upgrade. This means that the entire network will probably implement the upgrade together and there will be no action required from the end users.It\u2019s important that we emphasize this because there are several projects out there piggybacking on the upgrade and taking advantage of people. One of which, called Ethereum Nowa appears to be an outright scam.Ethereum Classic Hacked!!!Not to be confused with Ethereum, Ethereum Classic is a legitimate fork of Ethereum. A disagreement among the community back in 2016 led to a chain split. Since then Ethereum Classic (ETC) has not done too well, especially when compared to her sister Ethereum (ETH).Last night Coinbase put out the following alert on Ethereum Classic.TL;DR: Etherum classic has been hacked!!Explanation: The most common type of attack in crypto is known as a 51% attack. Basically, if a foul player manages to control more than half of the network\u2019s mining power (hashrate), they can basically rewrite history.Lingo: Rewriting history is also known as a reorganization or \u201creorg\u201d and the most common reason to do this would be to create a double spend. Or, erase a previous transaction so you can get your coins back and spend them again.Coinbase\u2019s blog identified no less than 15 reorgs, several of which contained suspicion of double spend activity amounting to an approximated $1.1 million, which has been siphoned from the network.Again, it\u2019s important to understand that ETC is not the same as ETH. In the initial moments after the blog was released, both coins sold off in the confusion but ETH did manage to regain composure fairly quickly.The reason is that Ethereum has a hashrate of about 20 times that of Ethereum Classic. So while it might be possible to temporarily get enough hashrate to control 51% of ETC\u2019s network, it would be practically implausible to affect ETH in this way.Putting things into perspective, if someone is dreaming about trying to 51% attack Bitcoin, they would need about 4,500 times the amount of hash than they do to attack ETC.So, anyone claiming crypto is in a state of emergency is dead wrong on this one. Simply put, this is yet another great example of how negative news is nothing more than a learning opportunity. All the newcomers that joined crypto in 2017 should be much more comfortable now with how blockchain and crypto works and that is ultimately a good thing.Have an amazing day ahead.

His decision to raise fuel tariffs in November has mushroomed and his country has succumbed to a wave of protests and violence the likes not seen since the 1960s. The yellow vests are everywhere and beyond causing chaos on the streets, it seems they\u2019re now turning against the banks.What\u2019s Going On in France?So far in Paris, demonstrators have fist-fought with riot police, cars have been set alight, and monuments damaged. While the number of protestors has fallen slightly, their proliferation has not. According to this Facebook page, Yellow Vest protesters are now planning another demonstration outside the Rothschild Bank of Lyon on January 9.Rothschild de Lyon Yellow Vest ProtestReports are also starting to abound that the infamous protestors are now planning a \u201cbank run.\u201d They are calling on all French citizens to withdraw their euros from the banks.French banks hold an estimated one-quarter or less of all the funds that would be required should French citizens take such an action. A bank run like this has the potential to paralyze the country and even collapse the euro.How Did the Yellow Vests Start?It started back in November after an unpopular decision by the French government to raise fuel prices. This is something that historically doesn\u2019t go down well with the French. Thousands of protestors took to the streets, many donning yellow vests (gilets jaunes). They set out to demonstrate their discontent by smashing windows, buildings, monuments, and disrupting traffic.While President Macron did make some economic concessions in December to try to appease protestors, the measures failed to placate an increasingly angry mob. They\u2019ve come to realize that it\u2019s not simply fuel prices that are upsetting them, forming one of the largest anti-government movements since 1968. Their grievances go way beyond a hike in fuel prices to inflation rates in general, untapped money printing eroding their wealth, and the elitist policies of Macron.These protests have been some of the most violent in recent times with fires even starting on the prestigious Boulevard Saint Germain in Paris last Saturday. Images of French boxer punching down a riot policeman have also been rife on social media. And the spokesman for the ministry of the government was even rammed with a forklift.You really don\u2019t want to piss off the French.What\u2019s Happened Since?The government\u2019s reaction has been swift and severe. It will do little to warm the people further to the right-wing regime they feel they are up against. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced plans to punish people who hold unsanctioned protests. He said that the government will create new legislation to ban protestors from wearing masks at rallies and support:new law punishing those who do not respect the requirement to declare [protests], those who take part in unauthorized demonstrations and those who arrive at demonstrations wearing face masks.Known troublemakers will also be prevented from attending the events, just as football hooligans are denied entry to a stadium. The problem with this, however, is that unlike a planned event at a football stadium, the French authorities can\u2019t stop people who aren\u2019t buying tickets or events organized on social media.And this hasn\u2019t served to stop the riots. In fact, the movement has gathered momentum, with some seven weeks of protests held every weekend of some kind in different cities across France. As many as 80,000 security forces will be deployed on the streets for the next expected wave of protests that are not limited to Paris. Other key cities, such as Lyon, Rouen, and Caen, are seeing protests on the weekends causing further disruption. More than 1,400 people have been injured with six people dead so far.What Does this Have to do with Bitcoin?Bitcoin fanatics have rallied behind the yellow vests after some of them were seen with signs on their backs saying \u201cBuy Bitcoin.\u201dThe truth is that of the thousands of yellow vests, probably only a handful of them support, understand, or are even aware of Bitcoin. However, this handful is a potentially powerful and growing army.The French protestors may not be armed with guns and guillotines. But they have a more powerful weapon at hand: knowledge.Yesterday, Bitcoinist reported that street art in Paris depicting yellow vests in protest and a woman raising the French flag high had a hidden bitcoin prize inside it. Spreading the word about bitcoin through art, protests, and private meetings are working. It\u2019s attracting the eyes of millions of people in France and around the world.Protest Outside the Rothschild Bank of Lyon The yellow vests have so far organized their protests largely on social media. According to the Facebook event mentioned above, some 300 have confirmed and more than 3,000 are interested in attending the protest at the Rothschild Bank of Lyon tomorrow. The significance of this runs way back to the country\u2019s 40-year-old grievance with France\u2019s private banking system. The French government borrows from them and is forced to repay with high-interest, plunging the country into further debt.A Possible Run on BanksThe word is spreading throughout social media about a possible run on banks. French boxer Nicolle Maxime has taken to YouTube incentivizing supporters to withdraw their funds from the banks. Other news sites such as the Daily Crusader are also talking about the significance of this move. This could paralyze the country, collapse the banking system in France, and even cause a collapse in the euro. The ambitious publication notes:This is potentially exciting news for the bitcoin and cryptocurrency community as a sudden surge of fresh cash could be about to hit the markets\u2026It may be too soon to celebrate an upswing in bitcoin price 00 just yet. After all, just because the French withdraw their euros does not mean that they will invest them in bitcoin. However, with the word spreading and the French being somewhat an incubator for innovative bitcoin startups, selling bitcoins from tobacco shops and the increasing yellow vest movement\u2013perhaps what\u2019s bad for the euro could be good for bitcoin.Max Keiser also said:If every French person converted 20% of their bank deposits into #Bitcoin (and got a Bitcoin debit card to use for day-2-day stuff), French banks and the government would collapse and a lot of bloodshed could be avoided. #jilletsjaunes #JeSuisSatoshi pic.twitter.com/stKqKHYHWl\u2014 Max Keiser, tweet artist. (@maxkeiser) December 9, 2018If every French person converted 20% of their bank deposits into Bitcoin\u2026 French banks and the government would collapse and a lot of bloodshed could be avoided.It will be interesting to see what\u2013if anything\u2013emerges from this for Bitcoin. Can the Yellow Vests spread awareness for a currency not controlled by central authorities and governments? Let\u2019s hope so, and also for an imminent end to the violence.Will the yellow vest protest pose a threat to the Euro?

That influx is set to kick off later sometime in early 2019 with the launch of Intercontinental Exchange\u2019s Bakkt platform, which will initially offer physically-delivered Bitcoin futures. The company announced it had raised $182.5 million last week.Ripple \u2018Overdone, Let\u2019s Just Say\u2019Asked about interest in altcoins, meanwhile, Miller said that MVP \u201chad not made up its mind\u201d about offering other cryptoassets. Singling out Ripple (XRP) 00, the executive appeared mistrusting, questioning the transparency of the project and related company Ripple.\u201cIf you look at something like a Ripple, I think that\u2019s way overdone, let\u2019s just say,\u201d he continued. The XRP thing doesn\u2019t have to be used on the Ripple network; you can use other things\u2026 If you look on Coinmarketcap.com it says there are 38 billion of them but there\u2019s actually around 100 billion because the company has retained 61 billion on their own balance sheet.Miller is far from alone in his skepticism of Ripple and XRP in particular.

Between wild price swings, sensational hash wars, Ethereum forks, 51% attacks, and bearish regulators, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the crypto space. And it\u2019s equally easy to forget that there\u2019s a whole other world out there that\u2019s blissfully unaware.Brockwell is a TV producer, MC, and host of NBTV blockchain/tech show. She\u2019s been making videos about Bitcoin since 2013 and was a policy associate at the New York Bitcoin Center from 2013 to 2015. In the following video posted on her YouTube channel, she admits that she didn\u2019t realize how little people outside of crypto knew about Bitcoin until now:During the trip so far I have discovered that no one outside the crypto world knows anything about Bitcoin.Here are some of the main takeaways:There\u2019s a Lot of Confusion About BitcoinMost people have heard of Bitcoin. But despite its price hovering around $4,000, that still doesn\u2019t mean they know what it is. There\u2019s still plenty of confusion generated upon hearing the word. \u201cYou can put any word in front of \u201ccoin\u201d and you\u2019ll get bitcoin,\u201d said one interviewee. He knew that it was money \u201con the internet,\u201d but was unsure about how to send it, asking whether you could fax or email it to people. Perhaps his most interesting question of all was:How do you get more than one bitcoin? Do they stack? Can you have more than one type of bitcoin?There Are Plenty of MisconceptionsOne of the participants in the car knew that Bitcoin is mined. However, he thought that you mined it through hitting blocks on the internet, like a Mario game. In fact, he believed that popular video game Minecraft was the way in which bitcoin was mined.Another interviewee said \u201cBitcoin is like an IOU with no legitimate promise to be fulfilled,\u201d and that the coin\u2019s appearance was very Mario-esque; \u201cthere\u2019s even a David Hasselhoff coin with a picture of his head on it!\u201d he exclaimed\u2026 \u201cThese are all types of bitcoin.\u201d His answers began to sound almost plausible to the other passengers until he blew his cover revealing that he actually knew nothing about what he was saying with the words:It is a cryptic currency meaning that currently, it\u2019s quite cryptic. When everyone began to shake their heads, he said that no one knew anything about Bitcoin:It\u2019s like a puzzle which has no answer inside. All these responses lead Brockwell to conclude:It is very clear that most people in the world are incredibly confused about Bitcoin and what it is and what cryptocurrency is.However, People Want to Learn MoreThat there\u2019s confusion among the mainstream should come as no surprise. Many people in the actual space are still grappling with their own learning curves. The media has played a helpful role in getting the word about Bitcoin and crypto out there. However, it has also served to add to the confusion with incorrect facts and unclear statements, images of bitcoin as an actual coin, rather than a string of numbers and letters. But the encouraging takeaway from the video is that people want to learn more. When Brockwell asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s your interest level in Bitcoin?\u201d one of the respondents replied that it was a 7. I feel like if someone taught me about Bitcoin I\u2019d be really interested\u2026 But when I google Bitcoin I never get any answers.Another added:I\u2019m really curious now, I\u2019d like to know more about Bitcoin.It\u2019s pretty clear that there\u2019s a lot of work to be done explaining Bitcoin to the masses. Although, we can also take some encouragement from the fact that Bitcoin has gotten so far without most of the world knowing what it is.Perhaps while the community works on scaling solutions, technology upgrades, and security, Bitcoin educators should also work on tightening the narrative.

Still, the idea seems tantalizing.Following my recent discussions with Professor Ginko and other Russian Government insiders, it appears there are several possible paths for them to implement this. Obviously, given the current regulatory and infrastructure environment, they can\u2019t just open an account at a crypto exchange or even obtain them on the OTC market.More likely, they\u2019ll need to set up an intermediary service, possibly introducing a new crypto coin, possibly through an already established financial institution, to help facilitate.Though we understand that Russia and a few other countries are very interested in de-dollarization, we can only speculate on how close they are to replacing it with bitcoin.Still, I can easily foresee a future where the governments and central banks of the world are holding large amounts of bitcoin in their national reserves similar to the way they hold gold today.@MatiGreenspan eToro, Senior Market AnalystToday\u2019s HighlightsShutdown: Day 19KodakCoin AnniversaryComing off their shortsPlease note: All data, figures & graphs are valid as of January 9th.

We Can Do More\u2026 In WyomingGovernor Gordon\u2019s speech covered the regulation thank-yous, big-ups, challenges ahead, and positivity. But of particular note was a section praising Wyoming industries for becoming leaders and doing more:In just this last year, Wyoming has become the envy of the nation for its innovative approach to Blockchain with new startups like BeefChain and SheepChain. We can do more. BeefChain launched a blockchain-based initiative for tracking and verifying the provenance of product in the meat industry. This enables a provable supply-chain link from a cut of meat, right back to the animal it came from and how that animal was treated.The western state is also starting to attract other businesses with its friendly legislation. One such company is IOHK, the company behind Cardano (ADA) 00. Its founder, Charles Hoskinson, confirmed the move when asked if he would consider moving his businesses to Malta, another blockchain-friendly destination.Well actually [IOHK is] leaving Hong Kong. We\u2019re moving to Wyoming next to Colorado in the United States. I live in Colorado. So we\u2019re now a US company.\u201dMeat\u2026 Chicken\u2026 FishThe livestock industry has been one of the more forward-thinking, having already implementing several blockchain supply-chain solutions. Aside from Wyoming\u2019s blockchain for Beef (and one assumes also one for Sheep), there are international source-traceable solutions, which also cover chicken and fish.French supermarket giant, Carrefour, uses the commercial version of IBM blockchain to track its products. QR codes on, for example, chicken packaging, provide details of where the chick hatched, lived, what it ate, and its age at slaughter.And a Fijian supply chain company, uses the Viant platform on the public Ethereum blockchain, to ensure traceability for fish from capture to sale.The Equality StateWyoming has positioned itself as unashamedly pro-cryptocurrency over the past year, adding a raft of bills to support blockchain and crypto-startups. Just a week ago, the state almost unanimously passed a bill allowing institutions to offer financial services using bitcoin and other blockchain-based assets.This was despite heavy opposition from the banking industry.IT BEGINS!

An excerpt from the report relating to cryptocurrencies reads:Given the significant growth and risks presented in this [the crypto] market, OCIE will continue to monitor the offer and sale, trading, and management of digital assets, and where the products are securities, examine for regulatory compliance. In particular, through high-level inquiries, OCIE will take steps to identify market participants offering, selling, trading, and managing these products or considering or actively seeking to offer these products and then assess the extent of their activities.To this end, the OCIE plans to examine the activities of firms operating in the digital asset market. This examination will cover sale, trading, as well as the management of cryptocurrency assets. The OCIE also plans to pay particular attention to cryptos deemed to be securities.Commenting on the approach for 2019, Pete Driscoll, Director of the OCIE, said:OCIE is steadfast in its commitment to protect investors, ensure market integrity and support responsible capital formation through risk-focused strategies that improve compliance, prevent fraud, monitor risk, and inform policy.Identifying the virtual currency market as a priority isn\u2019t a new development for the OCIE. Back in 2018, the emerging market also formed part of the OCIE\u2019s agenda. However, the mandate for 2019 appears to be an extension of the goal for last year, which focused primarily on risk and security.Too Much Regulation? The expansion of OCIE\u2019s focus on digital assets comes at a time when U.S. Federal Lawmakers are trying to establish a separate regulatory ambit for cryptocurrencies. Some commentators feel the SEC is over-regulating the industry, slowing the rate of innovation in the country with regard to digital assets.In December 2018, Reuters reported that members of the GOP were frustrated with the leadership of the SEC over their stance on most ICOs being securities. This new report from the OCIE expanding its examination focus might exacerbate such concerns. Meanwhile, for the SEC, the Commission continues to state that strict laws create a safer marketplace.What do you think about the SEC\u2019s focus on cryptocurrency in 2019?

Europe\u2019s banking watchdog believes such a move will eliminate unfair regulatory arbitrage while protecting investors across the bloc.A Common Monitoring TemplateThe EBA conveyed its clamor for a regional framework for cryptocurrency regulations in a report published on Wednesday, January 9, 2019. According to the banking regulator, such an approach would eliminate many of the risks inherent in the emerging asset class.Focusing on cryptocurrency exchange platforms and wallet providers, the EBA noted that current EU financial regulations were inadequate. On the national level, the banking watchdog decried the different regulations among member states.An excerpt from the report reads:These factors give rise to potential issues, including regarding consumer protection, operational resilience, market integrity, and the level playing field.For the EBA, having different cryptocurrency laws among member states creates undesirable regulatory arbitrage. Such a situation, the EBA believes, creates unfair competition, with businesses congregating in countries with less stringent regulations.The EBA also called for finalization of the extension of EU anti-money laundering (AML) laws to cover the crypto industry. In mid-2018, the EU adopted an AML directive targeted at cryptocurrencies.EU-Level Cryptocurrency RegulationIn its report, the EBA called for a nuanced approach to developing rules and standards for the emerging asset class. To this end, the banking regulator declared that the European Commission would be the best candidate to conduct a thorough cost/benefit analysis of possible EU-level cryptocurrency rules.The EBA notes in the report:Given the pace and complexity of change, it would be desirable for a technologically neutral and future-proof approach to be adopted in developing any proposals should it be concluded that EU-level action is needed.The EBA also identified the energy consumption associated with cryptocurrency mining activities as an integral part of any holistic analysis on the matter of EU-level regulations. For the EBA, it is vital that stakeholders balance fintech innovation with the commitment of the EU to the Paris Agreement in particular and climate change management in general.Is it possible to get member states to agree on a general framework for regulating cryptocurrencies?

Despite falling below $4000, BTC/USD remains well above the worst case scenario forecast by analysts such as Tone Vays, who warned the pair could yet fall to $1300 or even lower.

Actually, as it turned out, finding crypto at CES wasn\u2019t as easy as first expected.Technology Unveiled at CES 2019The Sunday before the show hosts a media event called CES Unveiled, featuring the Best of Innovation awards.After three hours feigning interested in a whole range of tech startups latest offerings, I was beginning to lose hope. The closest I\u2019d come to anything blockchain related was a point-of-sale device, which the exhibitor said: \u201ccould develop to include cryptocurrency payments in the future.\u201dJust as the event was finishing I stumbled across the Archos booth, where they were showing a new hardware wallet, the Safe-T touch. I arranged to meet them again during the show proper, with the possibility that they might be able to source a review model.On exiting the hall I was sequestered by a youth holding a sign saying CoinAgenda. Apparently there was a crypto-afterparty a short bus ride away. A quick straw poll of the guests suggested that nobody really knew what the party had to do with crypto. But there was an open bar, so nobody seemed overly concerned.Conference TracksMonday was spent exploring Vegas, but I did chance upon this Bitcoin ATM in a Love Boutique.Then Tuesday saw a full day of hosted panel-type discussions in the \u2018Digital Money\u2019 conference track. Access to these conference tracks required the purchase of an additional pass over and above the registration for the main event. Whilst I hadn\u2019t found much to report from the Unveiled show, there was a rich vein of cryptocurrency and blockchain, playing a prominent part in events.A diverse range of speakers and panel guests included Brock Pierce, Tim Draper, Michael Terpin of Transform group, and the Prince of the Netherlands. Sessions covered topics such as security, blockchain in the entertainment industry, regulation, and decentralization.Last on the schedule was \u2018The Second Annual Token Slugfest\u2019, in which six companies gave four-minute pitches for their ICOs. This concluded with a clap-o-meter type judging of the pitches, and the crowning of an eventual winner.Having spent the day bathed in the warm fuzzy glow of all things crypto, my spirits were rejuvenated. I planned to hit the show floor the next day to continue my search. Actually the (many) show floors. I hadn\u2019t realized quite how big this CES thing was.Images courtesy of Shutterstock, BitcoinistThe Rundown Technology Unveiled at CES 2019Conference Tracks"}

Even animals and birds acquire some of their vital life skills and knowledge through low-cost copying. That\u2019s because the individuals we tend to copy are typically top performers in their field, so we automatically skip the time-consuming trial and error stage. Copying is such a huge part of today\u2019s society that we had to draw a list of the top 5 hottest copy trends that shaped 2018 and we expect to see in 2019.#01: China has created perfect copies of Europe\u2019s prettiest capitalsChina\u2019s love for Europe has given rise to a bizarre copy trend known as \u201cduplicature\u201d, which aims to create flawless copies of foreign cities with impressive architectural heritage. Thanks to this, the Chinese have their own Paris, Venice, Barcelona and other European gems. In fact, the Chinese Paris has recently celebrated its 10th anniversary. While, at first, these \u201cfake cities\u201d have struggled to attract residents, they\u2019re full of the hustle and bustle of the city life today.2. Food-inspired baby namesChoosing a name for a new baby is tough, so it\u2019s not surprising that in 2018 parents have turned to favourite foods as the main source of namespiration. Topping this year\u2019s most popular name options for girls are Saffron, Clementine, Honey, Brie, Cherry and Ginger \u2013 closely followed by gems like Plum, Coco and Peaches. When it comes to boy names, new parents seem to be out of the orchards and roaming the veggie patches, as Basil, Kale, Angus, Chip, Caesar and Herb have come out on top.3. Royal ladies top the list of fashion influencersFashion analysts are telling us to forget the Kardashians and the Hadids and to start copying the Windsor ladies. A new research reports shows that over the past decade, quite a few royal influencers have left their mark on the fashion industry, including Queen Elizabeth II, Diana Princess of Wales, and the newest royal, Ms Meghan Markle. The royals have propelled such trends as riding boots, double-breasted tartan coats and \u201cpower shoulders\u201d. Copy like a fashion designer, feel like a royal.4. New technologies copy the science of Mother NatureThe science of copying the inventions of Mother Nature is called bionics. In many cases, the big technological breakthroughs we\u2019re hoping for already exist in nature \u2013 we just need to find a way how to replicate them. Scientists are hard at work studying some of the nature\u2019s most amazing inventions and funneling that knowledge into product development. We have recently seen ideas for bulletproof vests made of spider web, a super-adhesive tape that mimics a gecko\u2019s foot and swimsuits modelled on the skin of sharks. If nature is nailing it, why bother reinventing it?5: Copy trading is a thingSmart money management is one of the hottest skills right now.

What\u2019s more, Ginko expects Russia to also create an intermediary \u2018Bitruble,\u2019 which it will trade for bitcoin.\u201cThe proposal that I understand is on the desk of the finance minister at the moment is to create some sort of intermediary cryptocurrency,\u201d commented Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at eToro, in reaction to the news.We know that Vladimir Putin is a big advocate of blockchain technology. Obviously he doesn\u2019t like the sanctions that have been placed on him, and he\u2019s already said that these types of sanctions are going to lead to de-dollarization. This is more or less the direction the Russian government is going.Cryptocurrency Regulations High on the AgendaGreenspan also adds that \u201cthe only thing holding the country back is the legal framework to do so.\u201dInterestingly, fuelling the aforementioned rumors are new reports that Russian lawmakers are looking to prioritize creating a legal foundation for the cryptocurrency market this year.According to Alexander Zhukov, the First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma, cryptocurrency regulations are a primary focus of legislative work for 2019. An excerpt from a recent article on the official State Duma website reads:Among the priorities of parliamentary work in the spring session are issues of the development of the digital economy, bills aimed at improving the anti-corruption legislation, as well as amendments that will strengthen the fight against financial scammers.Apart from being one of the focus points for the Spring Session of the State Duma, matters relating to the cryptocurrency industry will also receive special attention.According to Zhukov, the Chairman of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin has mandated that special attention is paid to draft laws towards the development of the digital economy.Russia\u2019s Cryptocurrency Law May Finally Happen in 2019Despite several efforts, the country\u2019s legislature was unable to pass any cryptocurrency legislation in 2018. Even with the apparent urging of President Vladimir Putin, the State Duma didn\u2019t pass the \u201cOn Digital Financial Assets\u201d bill.With these new declarations from high-ranking members of the Russian Parliament, the country might finally be on the path of obtaining clear-cut regulations for the industry. Speaking during the opening plenary meeting, Volodin urged lawmakers to push beyond \u201clegislative blockages\u201d and focus on passing and enforcing laws.What impact do you think a $10 billion investment by Russia would have on the price of Bitcoin?

At press time, Bitcoin was trading around $3540, its lowest price since December 18.Shirakashi, presenting a bullish case, voiced skepticism over warnings previously issued by traders such as Tone Vays. As Bitcoinist reported, Vays, who previously correctly called the Bitcoin price drop to between $3000 and $3500, believes BTC/USD could touch just $1300 \u2013 or even lower.\u201cI have so much respect for Murad Mahmudov, David Puell, Willy Woo, Tone Vays but I have to respectfully disagree with them,\u201d Shirakashi wrote. I have a really strong case in hands that state: The Bitcoin bottom is in.A variety of technical indicators, including those developed by Mahmudov and Puell, support the view, he said.Woo Cautions On OptimismAt the same time, Woo focused on on-chain volume volatility to suggest that Bitcoin still had lower to go \u2013 less volatility is a prerequisite for price growth.\u201cIs the bottom in?

In order for the bottom to be in, the volume of coins changing hands becomes steady, currently it\u2019s very erratic, synonymous with middle of the bear detox.Is the bottom in?

He is an active investor on eToro and a fan of the platform\u2019s CopyPortfolio investment strategies. We asked him to answer a few questions about himself and his trading habits: Check out Chris Hyland\u2019s stats65% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider. You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.Past performance is not an indication of future results. This is not investment advice. Tell us a little bit about yourself? I grew up in the UK in Sussex. I am an entrepreneur \u2013 at the age of 26, I started a digital marketing agency called 4Ps Marketing with a friend/ business partner. The agency eventually went global and was sold to a larger company, NetBooster.How did you end up building The Happiness Index?Through experience at 4Ps Marketing, and having to deal with a lot of people, you kind of learn how important it is for people to be happy and motivated in their jobs. This is what our new business, The Happiness Index, focuses on. The mission is to change the world and redefine work/life balance. We were recently awarded the \u201cNew Business of the Year\u201d at the 2018 European Business Awards.Why did you choose to invest on eToro?I originally chose eToro because I loved the idea of choosing my own investments and controlling my own portfolio. I like the fact that I can choose my own instruments to invest in on their own and I can also invest in portfolios made by eToro such as BigTech or Driverless CopyPortfolio. I also really enjoy that I can copy other investors because they are trading on my behalf and I learn so much just by reading their updates. It\u2019s also really just a simple platform, whereas other platforms seemed very confusing to me.What is your previous experience in regards to investing? I\u2019ve been investing in small companies for 5-10 years, however, I\u2019ve only been investing in the stock market for a couple of years. I don\u2019t have so much experience.Which CopyPortfolios are you investing in and why?At the moment I\u2019m invested in a few CopyPortfolios:The first one is the FoodDrink CopyPortfolio \u2014 I chose this one because I wanted something safe and secure with low risk.Previously I was investing in the BigTech CopyPortfolio but I recently closed it and started investing in the CannabisCare Portfolio. I chose this one because, in my opinion, people are starting to realise that there\u2019s a massive opportunity to legalise cannabis and I see that market growing significantly bigger in the future.I also recently started investing in the YieldKing Portfolio. This was mostly for dividends. I also like to invest in companies which I believe will grow long term. I like how you can invest in the company and get money back on the way.What are your investment goals in regards to these CopyPortfolios?When things are going well, I sometimes think the CopyPortfolios are too safe, but when the market begins to drop \u2014 I think they\u2019re great. They really diversify my portfolio. I like how the portfolios are managed for me and I don\u2019t have to do anything.What do you think differentiates CopyPortfolios from investing elsewhere?I think the themes of the CopyPortfolios, especially the newer ones, are forward thinking- such as the CannabisCare and the CryptoPortfolio. I also do plan to invest in the CRISPR-Tech Portfolio as I believe in it long term. It\u2019s exciting and revolutionary.What are your hobbies/interests?I am definitely a family man. I enjoy spending time with my wife and 2 kids. I also love to eat good food and drink good beer \ud83d\ude42Check out Chris Hyland\u2019s stats65% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

Pre-Fork DropOn January 16th, Ethereum is scheduled to undergo a network-wide system update called \u2018Constantinople\u2019. Among other things, the implementation of the upgrade will reduce the block reward from 3 ETH/block to 2 ETH/block.Days before the event, however, Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) 00 price experienced a notable decline.In a matter of minutes, ETH price dropped by about 8 percent.The movement caused ETH to fall behind Ripple (XRP), which reclaimed its spot as the second largest cryptocurrency by means of market capitalization, less than two weeks after Ethereum regained the number two spot from XRP.In fact, the two have been neck and neck over the past few months in cryptocurrency market cap rankings.XRP 00 also experienced a decrease around the same time, but the cryptocurrency experienced a relatively smaller loss of 2.5 percent against the USD.Ethereum\u2019s \u2018Constantinople\u2019Constantinople is a system upgrade scheduled for implementation at block 7,080,000. Given the current average block time, the event should take place on January 16th, 2019.One of the most discussed changes that the upgrade will cause is the reduction of block reward from the current 3 ETH/block to 2 ETH/block. This is also referred to as the \u201cthirdening.\u201d It\u2019s the second time Ethereum\u2019s block rewards have been reduced.The first one was called \u201cByzantium\u201d and it took place on October 16th, 2017. Back then, ETH surged by about 6 percent during the day, followed by the cryptocurrency\u2019s late 2017 rally to an all-time high of about $1,400.In total, the upgrade will integrate 5 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), which are geared toward tackling cost, speed, functionality, and mining issues.Support For \u2018Constantinople\u2019Several cryptocurrency exchanges have announced their support for the upcoming network upgrade.Binance, HitBTC, Huobi, Bittrex, OKEx, CEX.IO, Cryptopia, and Poloniex, have all announced that they will support the Constantinople hard-fork.Most of them advise users to give sufficient time for their deposits to be processed prior to the upgrade.At the time of writing this, Gemini, Coinbase, and Bitfinex, haven\u2019t yet declared their support for the upgrade.What do you think about Constantinople and its impact on Ethereum?

We hadn\u2019t realized that it would be behind closed doors\u2026 and on the Sunday before the show proper had begun.The show guide had clear maps and an index of exhibitors, and the Ledger website had a schedule of product demonstration times. I chose the one labeled \u2018press only\u2019, which CEO Eric Larchev\u00eaque was presenting.The Ledger booth was really quite impressive. Obviously, not compared to electronics giants like LG, or the big car manufacturers, but much bigger than last year\u2026 at least, according to Larchev\u00eaque. He went through a quick demonstration of the Nano X, then was kind enough to give Bitcoinist a prototype model, so expect a full review soon.Digital Money MarketplaceAlong with the \u2018Digital Money\u2019 conference strand, the show had a number of marketplaces, where certain technologies were grouped together. After my success at the Ledger booth, I decided to try the \u2018Digital Money\u2019 marketplace.Now, again, the digital money marketplace was never going to compare with the likes of \u2018Smart Home\u2019, \u2018Fitness\u2019, or even \u20183D Printing\u2019, but even then it was a little underwhelming.Yeah, that\u2019s eight booths\u2026 and you\u2019ll notice one of them is empty, and the one next to that isn\u2019t really crypto related. Six of the smallest-sized booths and the larger map is just one of many many rooms, spread across three locations around the city.So what did I find? A Bitcoin ATM that also doubles as a normal ATM. The world\u2019s first apparently. But I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve written about something similar before. The world\u2019s fastest blockchain for business, Devvio. A blockchain platform based on Proof of Maintenance, crypto-lender and\u2026Hardware WalletsA trio of hardware wallets launched by SecuX. Dammit, I was meant to visit Archos!The SecuX wallets all featured vault-grade protection, multi-currency support, and large color screens. Two also had Bluetooth connectivity and embedded Li-polymer batteries to provide power for this.But where was Archos? Not listed in the directory, that\u2019s for sure. I aimed for the French section in the Eureka Park, another area with loose gatherings of companies under spurious banners. I struck luck.The Archos Safe-T touch is another Bluetooth-enabled device, with an even bigger screen. It runs a cut down version of Android, although there is also an isolated area, purely for transactions. Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t have a review model, so that will have to wait.As I wandered around the Eureka Park I continued to find small blockchain related companies who had traveled with a delegation from Ukraine or Switzerland, or grouped by a certain theme.By far the thing I saw most was hardware wallets.You Already Have A Hardware WalletOne of the speakers I had seen during the conference sessions, was Steven Sprague, CEO of Rivetz. He previously spent many years at Wave Systems working on trusted computing technology. Because of this, every PC built since 2006/7 has had a trusted secure enclave, just like a hardware wallet. Also, every smartphone since 2014 has had the same thing.I managed to catch a few minutes with Steven, and he very animatedly explained that all that was required was for the software to enable this secure portion. We already use our phone as a trusted device, so with the unlocking of the secure enclave, we could also use it to securely identify ourselves, either for cryptocurrency wallets, or anything else.To be continued\u2026Images courtesy of ShutterstockThe Rundown Distributing Ledger\u2019s TechnologiesDigital Money MarketplaceHardware WalletsYou Already Have A Hardware Wallet"}

All around the city are luxury hotel suites, hired to show off one\u2019s latest product to the select few. On my last day at CES, I had an invite to see an eco-friendly mining rig, or so I thought.A Trip To The Other SideMy time on the show floor had not been spectacularly productive. Whilst I had eventually found a smattering of crypto and blockchain related products and services, it wasn\u2019t much. And it was so well-hidden that I\u2019m sure there was probably a lot more I didn\u2019t find. Although the conference track was great, there was no real link back to the show. It was almost like a stand-alone event.But a lot of the business of CES goes on around the show. With the biggest names in tech in town, why distract yourself giving out lollipops to the great unwashed?A company called Azultec had invited Bitcoinist to a private viewing of an environmentally sound mining rig. I washed.The $61,000 QuestionFounder and CMO, Aaron Licht, gave me a warm welcome and dropped his first bombshell. The Azultec Cube 300, which was what I had come to see, had been held in customs\u2026 so I couldn\u2019t see it. Bombshell two swiftly followed as I was told that the device wasn\u2019t just a cryptocurrency miner any more either.In developing the most energy efficient cryptocurrency miner, Azultec shifted focus to a far more lucrative application. The machine can still be used to mine a number of GPU-friendly alt-coins, but processing power can be divided between this and cloud rendering. Licht told me that rendering alone could bring in $61,000 per month.I repeated the figure to confirm it. He confirmed. Sadly, after checking the product documentation it seems I was being told six (hundred) to one-thousand dollars per month. The documentation says $600-2000, but this must have been where the confusion arose. That\u2019s still a great passive income on a $7000 device, and that\u2019s without any gains from mining.Environmental CredentialsThe Cube 300 boasts a liquid cooling system servicing both the 8 GeForce GTX graphics cards and the 4GB DDR RAM. Power consumption averages 1450 watts and the device achieves an OctaneBench score of 768 points, and an Ethereum hash rate of 310 MHash/s.It is designed to connect directly into a home heating system, enabling capture and reuse of 72% of the energy consumed. This can reduce heating bills, and hence gross operating costs. It can also connect to a fuel cell, which converts natural gas into electrical energy. This type of fuel cell is heavily subsidized in Azultec\u2019s native Germany, so it\u2019s a great way to further reduced carbon footprint.A Race Against TimeWhilst I was talking with Mr. Licht, a message came through that the device had finally cleared customs and was being delivered imminently. We grabbed some breakfast to kill time, but no further news. I went back across to the show floor to kill some more time, but at the end of the day, the Cube 300 had still not arrived.Obviously, I was given pictures, but it would have been great to see (and hear) it running, as I had been told it was almost whisper-quiet.Still, we\u2019ve been promised a review model, so there should be time to give you the full low-down before the ICO starts in March. Pre-registration is open now, and there is even an on-ramp for fiat investors, which is a bit of a novelty.Oh, and if by any slim chance the device does bring in $61,000 per month in render fees, I totally promise to write the review for you all before I disappear to Bali.As for CES\u2026 I\u2019ll be going back. A little older and wiser though, and better prepared to sift through the mass of exhibitors in search of the crypto-stories being told within.Images courtesy of Bitcoinist, ShutterstockThe Rundown A Trip To The Other SideThe $61,000 QuestionEnvironmental CredentialsA Race Against Time"}

Lawmakers have also attempted to address legal aspects of token phenomena such as ICOs. For the state to interact with a Blockchain token officially, however, multiple use cases should be available, he said, which in turn will dictate when a token such as the Cryptoruble could surface on the market.\u201cThe more widely Blockchain is used in our financial operations \u2013 and not just financial but economic ones as well \u2013 the more likely it is the Cryptoruble will appear,\u201d he added.Regulation Or \u2018Putin Pump\u2019?Russia continues to find itself in limbo regarding cryptocurrency regulation. A package of laws which the Duma initially accepted last year has since met with skepticism from the country\u2019s central bank, which has apparently delayed its full implementation.More recently, rumors have begun appearing that despite the unofficial status of tokens such as Bitcoin, Russia plans to actively invest in the market as a method to skirt US sanctions. A corresponding surge in the quantity of Bitcoin purchased by Russian citizens has also become apparent, one source claimed this week. Some Russian figures had previously mentioned the idea of using Bitcoin for such political purposes.What do you think about the Cryptoruble?

The firm\u2019s previous BTC ETF filing was among the ones rejected by the SEC in 2018Physically-backed Bitcoin ETFIf at first, you don\u2019t succeed, try again. The famous maxim seems contextual for Bitwise as the firm prepares for another go at obtaining SEC approval for a Bitcoin ETF. According to a press release published on Thursday, January 10, 2019, the cryptocurrency asset management firm filed an initial registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC.This new filing is for a physically-backed Bitcoin ETF listed on the NYSE Arca. According to the announcement by Bitwise, the newly proposed BTC ETF will track the company\u2019s Bitcoin Index.Going forward, NYSEC Arca should in the coming days, file a \u201cRule Change\u201d with the SEC allowing it to list shares of the Bitwise BTC ETF under an approved ticker symbol.Satisfying the SECFor Bitwise, the focus is on satisfying the SEC this time around. The Commission has continuously affirmed its misgivings about approving a Bitcoin ETF based on issues such as market manipulation, fair pricing, and liquidity.Commenting on the company\u2019s preparedness in this regard, the Global Research chief at Bitwise, Matt Hougan, said:The SEC has asked thoughtful and relevant questions about the quality of the crypto trading ecosystem, the reliability of crypto pricing, the strength of the arbitrage function in crypto and the robustness of crypto custody. We have spent the past year researching these questions and look forward to discussing those findings with the SEC staff in connection with the filing and listing application.One of the significant changes included in the new filing is that it uses third-party custody services. As for fair pricing concerns, the Bitwise BTC index aggregates pricing data from many of the prominent exchange platforms in the industry. The company is hoping that such a mechanism constitutes fair asset pricing for the SEC.The Quest for BTC ETF Approval ContinuesFor John Hyland, the Bitwise Global ETF chief, the hope of an SEC-approved Bitcoin ETF remains firm. Commenting on the issue, Hyland said:While there can be no assurance that the 19b-4 application will be granted or the SEC will review and ultimately accelerate the registration statement, we are optimistic that 2019 should be the year that a bitcoin ETF launches.In February, the Commission will decide on the last remaining BTC ETF filing from 2018. Having used up all the postponements allowed by law, the SEC must deliver a final approval or rejection of the VanEck/SolidX proposal.Do you think the outcome for Bitwise will be different this time around?

Yet, when it comes to cryptocurrency adoption, time and again, we\u2019re seeing the smaller countries pick up the torch. Next in line after Malta, Gibraltar, Lichtenstein, and Switzerland is the Republic of the Marshall Islands, developing their own legal tender called SOV.SOV was announced back in March of last year, and unlike the pomp and rhetoric behind Venezuela\u2019s Petro, SOV is actually meant to improve the lives of the people of the RMI. It\u2019s not \u2018backed\u2019 by barrels of oil or the islands\u2019 main crops of coconuts or bananas either. And now they\u2019re bringing blockchain expert Steve Tendon on board.A Blockchain Expert to Help Develop SOVTendon was the Strategy Lead on Malta\u2019s National Blockchain Task Force advising the Prime Minister\u2019s office on blockchain policy. As Managing Director of ChainStrategies blockchain consulting firm, he authored Malta\u2019s National Blockchain Strategy. This was unanimously approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in April 2017. Beyond the three laws Malta passed last year regulating exchanges, DLT, cryptocurrency, and ICOs, the strategy lays out six clear pillars to blockchainize the island from public registries to smart governance.Source: https://chainstrategies.comTendon told Bitcoinist:The SOV is important for a number of reasons\u2026 While other countries have tried or announced similar moves, no one actually succeeded. Succeeding here means gaining acceptance both in the conventional financial markets world as well as in the crypto world.This is because SOV will effectively be a cryptocurrency, not a central bank issued digital currency. It will be based on blockchain technologies and not on centralized databases under one central authority. Says Tendon:If successful, it would build a bridge between the conventional world of old money and the new world of crypto money. It could become the crypto onboarding platform that could see mass adoption by those who so far have not had the knowledge, exposure or opportunity to use crypto.The Marshall Islands EconomyThe SOV is also of greater significance for addressing the pressing financial and environmental challenges that the country faces as an island economy in the Pacific. Moreover, the Marshall Islands will face a severe economic crisis in 2023 when the funding aids from the USA will end. Tendon explains:The SOV could launch a thriving crypto economy for the country. There\u2019s a humanitarian aspect to the project, as well. The intent is to benefit the people of the Marshall Islands. This is something Tendon comments that conventional legal tender money has never attempted to achieve.Chief Economist for SOV and former Secretary General of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Dr. Peter Dittus said: We are growing closer every day to support the Marshall Islands with issuing the first digital legal tender and launching a financial services economy around it.By opening up to the blockchain economy, the RMI plans not only to aid its people but to become something of a crypto-financial powerhouse, setting a leading global example.What Does Tendon See in SOV?Tendon explains that working to create the Blockchain Island was certainly an exciting challenge. However, it became clear to him that a national currency like the SOV would never be possible.Why? Because Malta is a full member of the European Union\u2013and that imposes regulatory constraints. The Marshalls are probably one of the few places where you find both the necessary freedom as well as the motivation to do something like this. If the SOV succeeds it would have macroeconomic consequences, so it is a very ambitious undertaking.This would be a benefit not only the Marshall Islands themselves, but also Malta and any other jurisdiction, organization, or startup that engages in developing new businesses on top of blockchain technologies.I see the SOV project as a great way to add even more value to what started off in Malta. The two jurisdictions could effectively cooperate to create new opportunities, leveraging on their respective strengths; and possibly the whole cryptosphere would become stronger because of this.What do you think about the Marshall Islands\u2019 SOV initiative?

A situation in which one mining entity gained control of over half the network\u2019s hash rate caused double spending of thousands of ETC on several exchanges including Bitrue, Gate.io, and, most notably, Coinbase. Coinbase posted on its Twitter account that the exchange had detected the attack on January 5 and temporarily paused movements:On 1/5/2019, Coinbase detected a deep chain reorganization of the Ethereum Classic blockchain that included a double spend. In order to protect customer funds, we immediately paused movements of these funds on the ETC blockchain. Read more here: https://t.co/vCx89dz44m\u2014 Coinbase (@coinbase) January 7, 2019However, a report by blockchain security firm Slowmist claimed that no one noticed the attack until the damage was done on January 7. This is when Slowmist says it warned both Coinbase and the ETC network. This appears to be confirmed below by Ethereum Classic.\"Chinese blockchain security firm SlowMist sent out an alert that the Ethereum Classic (ETC) network might have been targeted by a 51% attack.\"Exclusive: One $ETC Private Pool Claimed over 51% Network Hashrate \u2013 Reported via @SlowMist_Team https://t.co/Bshi6OWCaJ\u2014 Ethereum Classic (@eth_classic) January 7, 2019Most of the damage was absorbed by Coinbase, reporting double spending of some 219,500 ETC totaling around $1.1 million. That kind of sucks for Coinbase. But what about the havoc wreaked upon the ETC network? Actually, there wasn\u2019t really any.Exchanges Are the Victims of 51% AttacksJust days after the attack, it\u2019s business as usual on the ETC network. The ETC coin 00 has bearly taken a hit and remains among the top 20 altcoins on CoinMarketCap. The price bearly even registered a drop.According to blockchain analyst and assistant professor at Kings College London Patrick McCorry, ETC took \u201ca bit of a hit\u201d but recovered in a day, suggesting that 51% attacks can happen but traders remain unfazed.Fun fact about the 100-block reorg in Ethereum Classic.None of the traders care about it. Look at the price \u2013 it took \"a bit of a hit\", but its mostly recovered in a day.Great lesson \u2013 you can attack a coin, perform a double-spend, and most traders won't care. pic.twitter.com/j6mUcCSV37\u2014 Patrick McCorry \u2618\ufe0f (@paddykcl) January 8, 2019Chief Strategy Officer at CoinShares and industry expert Meltem Demirors replied that ETC price was less sensitive to news and that its small community meant that attacks like these were less problematic.ETC price is less sensitive to news because:1. OGs got free option from 2016 ETH fork2. USD / BTC \u27a1\ufe0f ETC buyers are speculators, if funds are SAFU, \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f DGAF3.

This would suggest that exchanges are the real victims of 51% attacks since they have no way of having the funds reimbursed.Cryptocurrency researcher Hasu wrote on his Twitter that exchanges lose the most from crypto\u2019s most feared attacks:Exchanges are the primary victim of 51% attacks. Exchanges don\u2019t list cryptocurrencies for their immutability, but to make money and apparently, the R/R pays off for them. It\u2019s *extremely* hard for a 51% attacker to target users who actually value immutability.A 51% Attack on Bitcoin Is Still Extremely UnlikelyLuckily for exchanges, traders, and networks, a 51% attack on the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency is still extremely unlikely. It\u2019s not impossible of course, but taking a look at the facts laid out by Bitstamp exchange on their Twitter today, the costs of performing a 51% attack on Bitcoin would far outweigh the benefits.In fact, it would be \u201cunrealistic\u201d according to a recent study. The equipment costs alone would run into the billions of dollars.DID YOU KNOW: Hacking #Bitcoin with a 51% attack would require spending around $5.5M per day on electricity (if the cost of electricity is $0.05 per kWh). This is just the energy cost, the necessary equipment would cost billions. #WednesdayWisdom \ud83d\udca1 pic.twitter.com/GW01HiPpXv\u2014 Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) January 9, 2019So, it seems that exchanges like Coinbase can breathe easier when it comes to mega coins like Bitcoin. But the Ethereum Classic attack just goes to show that exchanges need to have stricter policies in place to protect them from double spends and 51% attacks on networks with smaller hash rates.Oh, and perhaps running a node to verify network transactions would also help.Do you agree that 51% attacks don\u2019t affect price?

All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsStocks in the USA struggled to close in the green yesterday and by the end of the Asian session this morning it seems pretty clear that the monster rally we\u2019ve been seeing in the markets this year is losing steam. Overall, the markets do seem to be at an inflection point right now.Some analysts are citing the fact that the US-China talks ended without resolution as a contributing factor, but I\u2019m not so sure. What\u2019s really strange to me is the market almost completely ignoring recent signals from the Fed that it is willing to be more supportive.Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be taking questions at an event this evening and we hope he\u2019ll be able to clarify the Fed\u2019s stance. At the moment, pundits are having a bit of trouble predicting what the largest player in the financial markets will do next.A supportive Fed could really help the markets out right now. So could an agreement to reopen the US government, but let\u2019s not get greedy.Suspicious RallyThe recent rally has been suspicious because, despite rising prices, stocks are still extremely volatile. Gold continues to surge forward and is again giving a serious test of $1,300. Should the market turmoil continue and the US Dollar continues to weaken, it could very well blast right through that barrier.Crypto DropMany have been asking about the sudden drop in the crypto markets this morning. In my view, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any real reason for this drop, neither technical nor fundamental.The one interesting thing about this movement is that it seems to be an exact reversal of the surge that happened on Sunday afternoon.

He also holds that the use of digital currencies will rise in countries with distraught economies. Cryptocurrency Over GoldSpeaking at the Israel Bitcoin Summit at Tel Aviv University on January 8th, legendary cryptographer, Nick Szabo, said that national central banks might resort to cryptocurrency reserves as means of supplementing existing national gold reserves.\u201cBitcoin could survive a nuclear war\u201d @NickSzabo4 #bitcoinsummit pic.twitter.com/IIn1CzyKJ9\u2014 Steph Vaughan\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbc\ud83d\ude80 (@GoodStephV) January 8, 2019One of the reasons for this to happen, according to Szabo, is the potential lack of trust between foreign banks or governments:There\u2019s going to be some situations where a central bank can\u2019t trust a foreign central bank or government with their bonds for example. [\u2026] One solution that\u2019s been developed is to have the Swiss government hold it for you \u2013 that\u2019s not a trust minimized solution. The Swiss government itself is subject to political pressures and so a more trust minimized solution is cryptocurrency.In addition, Szabo also notes that gold reserves are \u201cphysically vulnerable,\u201d saying:The other problem with gold reserves is that they\u2019re physically vulnerable. When the Nazis conquered countries in Europe, the first place they went to was a central bank\u2019s gold reserves.Bitcoinist reported on the uncanny resemblance in the historical performance of gold and Bitcoin in the past. Unlike gold, however, Bitcoin \u201chas more utility\u201d admitted US economist and Bitcoin-critic Paul Krugman.The Winklevoss twins also recently stated that \u201cBitcoin is better at being gold than gold,\u201d predicting that it should surpass the precious metal\u2019s $7 trillion dollar market cap in the future.Helping Distraught EconomiesAnother thing the Bitcoin pioneer shared was that censorship-resistant cryptocurrencies will grow in popularity in countries, which suffer from failed monetary planning, as well as those which have been blacklisted from trade.There seems to be substantial merit to his thoughts. Venezuela, for example, is a country which is currently being torn by hyperinflation. In fact, the Director of the Western Hemisphere Department of the International Monetary Fund, Alejandro Werner, said that 10 million percent inflation rate is not out of the picture:Yes, 10 million percent because prices in Venezuela are doubling or tripling every month. And that, when you take it to 12 months, generates an exponential inflation rate.As Bitcoinist reported in late December, the country saw its biggest jump in bitcoin volume on LocalBitcoins.What is more, a Russian university lecturer with ties to the government, Vladislav Ginko, has recently revealed that the country is planning to invest in Bitcoin as a means of avoiding US sanctions.Whether this is true remains to be seen, but US sanctions indeed have little effect on a neutral global digital currency like Bitcoin\u201cBecause of US sanctions, Russia\u2019s elite is forced to dump US assets and US dollars and invest hugely into Bitcoins. The central bank of Russia sits on $466 billion of reserves and has to diversify in case there are limited opportunities to do it (in the future),\u201d Ginko said.What do you think of Nick Szabo\u2019s statements?

The news comes as the Bitcoin mining behemoth continues to downsize both the scale of its operations as well as its staff numbers.$500 Million Bitcoin Mining Project on HoldAccording to Texas Public Radio (TPR), Bitmain his suspending its plans to build a $500 million crypto mining and data center in Rockdale. Commenting on the news, Steve Young, the Milam County Judge, said:I\u2019m really disappointed because we had advertised this. We had waited for this and had wanted this. We had welcomed this. This was huge. We need some positive news here and some jobs here. We need a tax base here, and this was a step in the right direction.Back in mid-2018, the company announced plans to build one of the largest Bitcoin mining centers in North America. At the time, Bitmain said the facility situated on the Alcoa aluminum smelting site would commence operations in 2019, providing as many as 500 jobs.For Young, the news is yet another blow to the local economy of a place struggling to attract investments. Dave Barkemeyer, a former Milam County Judge, says the county has lost about 30 percent of its tax revenue in the last ten years.Massive Downsizing of OperationsAs at press time, Bitmain is yet to issue any official word on the matter. However, a spokesperson for the company intimated that Bitmain was in the process of downsizing its operations across the United States. In an email reportedly sent to Young, the spokesperson said:The right-sized team at Rockdale now has the expertise to re-start the project at small scale anytime. Bitmain would like to ramp up the site at a slower pace and scale based on market conditions.According to Young, Bitmain had already made some significant progress on the facility with as many as 8,000 servers running into millions of dollars already on site.Meanwhile, the company continues to make the rounds on the cryptocurrency news circuit with reports of retrenchments across various departments. On Thursday, Bitcoinist reported that the company will be getting a new CEO as the co-founders step down from administrative duties.Bitmain losing dominance = more decentralisation\u2013 Laying off 50% staff (reported)\u2013 Mining pool dominance down 28% in last 6 months\u2013 Poor bet on BCH at the cost of losing BTC\u2013 Lost key chip designer\u2013 ASICs losing competitive edge\u2013 Growing competition (Canaan, Halong, Ebang)\u2014 Misir Mahmudov (@misir_mahmudov) January 8, 2019Since December 2018, Bitmain has fired employees in both its R&D and Bitcoin Cash development department.

However, the new law also entitles the Cyberspace Administration of China to supervise node operators, as well as to request private information. New Blockchain RegulationsChina\u2019s Office of Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission (CAC) issued new regulations dubbed \u201cRegulations on the Management of Blockchain Information Services.\u201d According to the release, the new law will take full effect on February 15th.The regulations paint providers of \u201cblockchain information services\u201d with a broad brush defining it as the \u201cprovision of information services to the public through Internet sites and applications based on blockchain technology or systems.\u201dAdditionally, blockchain service providers can be an:entity or node that provides the blockchain information service to the public and the organization or organization that provides technical support for the blockchain information service.For \u2018Healthy Development of Blockchain\u2019China released draft guidelines back in October 2018, which were geared to halt anonymous blockchain use.The current regulations are supposedly geared at promoting the \u201chealthy development of blockchain technology and related services.\u201d But the real question is: at what cost?First off, blockchain service providers will be requested to register their services types, industry fields, names, server address, as well as any changes made to them in future with the CAC. This information would become publicly available.In other words, the new law makes it illegal for users to download and run bitcoin\u2019s free and publicly available software client because a \u201cblockchain service provider\u201d can be a node that provides the blockchain information service to the public.In order to do so, they\u2019d have to go through a registration process and give up their private information. Perhaps users who don\u2019t want to be fined will be better off using Tor \u2013 a hidden service allowing most firewalls and network address translation setups to be bypassed.Today, China accounts for a 3.98% (or 408) of all reachable Bitcoin nodes, according to data from BitNodes.Additionally, the guidelines also require blockchain service providers to allow the authorities access to their data and to go through registry procedures where users\u2019 ID cards numbers are necessary.Those who fail to oblige by the new regulations will be subjected to a fine.It seems that the country\u2019s position on blockchain and cryptocurrencies remains rather tight.

Ginco is originally from Japan, where is offers cryptocurrency wallets, but operates two mining facilities in the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar. As Bitcoin 00 dropped in value over 2018, miners have felt the pinch, with a lower price impacting on the profitability of minting new coins, though mining difficulty has adjusted since.As Bitcoinist reported, China bore the brunt of the downturn, images appearing on social media of vast numbers of mining rigs being dumped due to being too expensive to keep running. Bitmain, the Chinese giant which has traditionally held a monopoly over the market, has sparked multiple rumors about its debts, senior management reshuffles and plans to fire up to half its 2500 workers.Bear Market BullsWhen raw materials need to be as cheap as possible, it is thus countries like Mongolia that are set to profit. Although it only started in October, Ginco Mongol plans to increase the number of units it has dedicated to Bitcoin mining from 600 to 1600 by the end of the year. In an interview prior to the launch, Yuma also revealed ideas for spin-off projects, including miner repair services.With the legal situation regarding mining also a gray area in China, it is little surprise that the Bitcoin industry is spreading more evenly across multiple countries worldwide. Increasingly, it is eco-friendly schemes in places as varied as Spain and Canada which plan to contribute to the market.However, in future, the world\u2019s Bitcoin mining crown will likely belong to Paraguay, the country\u2019s government signing off on plans to build the largest mining farm on the planet under a project dubbed the \u2018Golden Goose.\u2019 What do you think about Mongolia\u2019s Bitcoin mining expansion?

For those of you who aren\u2019t familiar, quantum computers think a bit differently than the PCs and smartphones we have now and are much better at solving complex mathematical problems.The release of this new computer instantly piqued the interest of some members in crypto who asked: \u201cdoes this new quantum computer threaten bitcoin?\u201dThe answer as usual, can be found in the video archives of the great Andreas Antonopoulos who said explains\u2026The threat of quantum computing is only real if it\u2019s available to one actor and not to others. Even still, if a person did manage to develop their own supercomputer, bitcoin would probably be too small a target to waste it on.Meaning, if quantum computers are readily available to everyone, then the entire bitcoin network will upgrade together and there is no threat.When I tweeted this answer out yesterday, I was delighted to receive further clarification from legendary cypherpunk and cryptographer Adam Back, who I had the pleasure of meeting at a bitcoin birthday party last week.In these three tweets, Adam explains that the Q System One is \u201csuper weak\u201d even compared to a 1972-era computer.

All trading carries risk. Only risk capital you can afford to lose.Traditional MarketsJerome Powell, the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Bank, answered questions at an event yesterday and clarified the Fed\u2019s position on monetary policy, just as the markets were hoping.The Fed is currently the biggest player in the market, so this is a pretty big deal. Jay, as his family calls him, stressed caution and patience above all when dealing with interest rate hikes. The markets were previously expecting two or three hikes this year and it seems like Jay is trying to bring them down to one or less.There was, however, a noticeable drop down in the Dow Jones when they discussed the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. Not that anything critical was really discussed but it seems to have become a trigger word for the markets.The truth is that according to the explanations given last night, it doesn\u2019t seem like they have any plans at the moment and rather will act according to the situation when the time comes. It\u2019s a bit disappointing on one hand because \u201cforward guidance\u201d was a theme stressed by Powell\u2019s predecessors, Bernanke and Yellen. On the other hand, perhaps now we can quite Fed watching and let the markets be a bit more independent.Still ShutBy tomorrow, this will have been the longest government shutdown in US history.Jay Powell also gave a rare comment on this last night saying that usually, shutdowns don\u2019t have a great impact on the economy because they don\u2019t last very long. However, if we were to see a prolonged shutdown the implications could be very big indeed.For example, one of the wings currently closed is the Consensus Bureau, who is responsible for putting out critical economic data like retail sales and GDP. If those stats aren\u2019t published, investors, economists, and even the Fed will essentially be flying blind.Bitcoin\u2019s new RangeYou\u2019ve probably already noticed that Bitcoin and the other cryptos took a sharp plunge yesterday. Actually, two sharp plunges.As we discussed in yesterday\u2019s update, there appear to be no specific reasons for this drop and it\u2019s more likely due to the lack of liquidity inherent in the crypto markets, possibly mixed with some large orders being placed on exchanges.If yesterday\u2019s explanation of no specific explanation annoyed you in any way, you\u2019re really gonna love this next one.The total movement of 12% from peak to trough was actually insignificant. All we\u2019re seeing is a movement from the top to the bottom of the range. Check it out. Here we can see bitcoin\u2019s price since it first fell below $6,000.As we\u2019ve been discussing since mid-November, the current range is from $3,000 to $5,000 (dotted blue lines). It seems now, that bitcoin has opened a new mini-range within that from $5,550 to approximately $4,200 (yellow lines).Movements within a range can sometimes be sudden like we saw yesterday, but unless there\u2019s a breakout of the key levels there really isn\u2019t much to write home about.Wishing you a relaxing weekend.This content is provided for information and educational purposes only and should not be considered to be investment advice or recommendation.Past performance is not an indication of future results.

When the going gets tough and the coffers start emptying, the first head on the chopping block is usually the marketing intern. Followed by PR and event organization. But while the industry\u2019s certainly seen a few layoffs in 2018, crypto conferences are still going strong.Crypto Conferences Bucking a TrendAccording to cryptocurrency researcher TradeBlock, even in the crypto bear market, when you may have expected to see a correlating decline in conferences, that was far from the case.In fact, with the exception of December, crypto conferences hit their highest numbers toward the end of the year in October and November.Despite the #crypto bear market during 2018, the number of industry related conferences did not see a steady decline in the latter half of the year. In the chart below, we track the number of conferences that occurred across the globe over the year. pic.twitter.com/vN6YJBBa3r\u2014 TradeBlock (@TradeBlock) January 10, 2019What Does This Mean?Even in a bear market, industry events did not die out (in fact, there were some 53 and 52 conferences in November and December respectively).The other month with the highest number of crypto conferences in 2018 was May. This saw some of the industry\u2019s best-known and highest-attended conferences, such as Consensus in New York and Silicon Valley\u2019s Global Disruptive.Bitcoin conference in Prague, 2018The conference scene slowed down a little throughout the summer unsurprisingly, but picked up speed again in September, with some 39 conferences. These included World Blockchain Forum in London and Berlin\u2019s Dezentral.October and November saw conferences with more focus on regulation. The hotly-awaited Malta Blockchain Summit saw an attendance of around 8,500 delegates. And Web Sumit in Lisbon as the world\u2019s largest tech conference pulled in some 70,000.Despite many studies pointing to a dwindling interest in crypto from the public, it seems the industry is still keeping the home fires burning.Crypto conferences are not cheap either. A regular ticket at a mass event like Consensus or Web Summit will set you back around $2,000.That the crypto conference bull run didn\u2019t end in 2018 is a positive sign for the industry. There may be less popular interest, but more and more industry investors are keen on entering the market.According to the annual SFOX Volatility Report:While public discussion about crypto has waned since the start of the year, we\u2019re seeing sustained interest at SFOX from institutional investors who want exposure to crypto.Crypto Is Alive and KickingThe same report places the crypto market at \u2018moderately bearish\u2019 as we enter 2019. But while prices look to be on a downward spiral once more, blockchain companies are busy building key infrastructure.Solutions for scaling will find real use cases this year, Walmart and Wall Street will place more confidence in blockchain tech, and clearer regulation in the US should help ease uncertainty. So let\u2019s hope the conferences keep up the pace throughout 2019 as well. And that they keep on serving free drinks.Will 2019 see a change in the bull market trend for conferences?

This move is the latest salvo from the banking industry in a country where cryptos seem all but banned.Upping the AnteOn Friday (Jan. 11, 2019), Morgan Creek founder and partner, Anthony Pompliano published a tweet culled from sources in India about the latest move by banks in India to prevent Bitcoin trading. According to the tweet, banks sent out warnings telling their customers not to deal in cryptos or risk the closure of their account.Banks in India are now saying they will now close customers' accounts if they deal in cryptocurrencies.These legacy institutions fear what they can't control, but people should be allowed to do whatever they want with their wealth.Long Bitcoin, Short the Bankers! pic.twitter.com/vvjniodaiL\u2014 Pomp \ud83c\udf2a (@APompliano) January 11, 2019The notice even declared that banks need not send any further correspondence before closing customer accounts. Pomp\u2019s tweet came directly from another Twitter user; Indian CryptoGirl, who commented on the situation saying:Indian Banks now forcefully taking permission from us to \u2018reserve right to close our account without further intimation\u2019 if we deal in #cryptocurrency transactions Ability to decide what to do with our own money is the very reason we need to invest, #BUIDL, & believe in #bitcoin.There are also reports of similar messages on ATM screens belonging to Kotak Mahindra Bank. According to Indian CryptoGirl, the bank has even made good on its threat. In an update of the situation posted on Saturday (Jan. 12, 2019), the bank issued a notice of account closure for doing transactions involving cryptocurrencies.\"We noticed you did a transaction involving crypto, hence, we will close your account within 30 days\"\u2013 Kotak Mahindra BankP.S: Glad they're doing it for me pic.twitter.com/JIWzeU54i5\u2014 Indian CryptoGirl (@DesiCryptoHodlr) January 12, 2019Bitcoin all but BannedUnsurprisingly, the reaction on social media has been one of outrage with many saying Bitcoin is all but banned in India. In 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI); the country\u2019s apex bank, prohibited banks from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions.A coalition of stakeholders challenged the decision, and the matter remains unresolved. The government failed to respond to a Supreme Court deadline back in October 2018. Reports are indicating a plan to establish regulatory clarity for the market.However, before such regulations emerge, the legacy banking system in India continues to stifle avenues for cryptocurrency trading. With the government failing to provide a definite stance on cryptos, the RBI ban remains the de facto regulation in the country.What do you think about this latest move by Indian banks; legitimate concerns or fear of being usurped by decentralized currency systems?

It can include user or API data, simplifying monetized interfaces & enabling new use cases. https://t.co/BbWuw9spk1\u2014 Stadicus (@Stadicus3000) January 12, 2019The Lightning Network is a protocol currently active for Bitcoin and Litecoin which allows users to send tokens instantly and for a fee averaging less than 1 US cent.The technology debuted on the Bitcoin network a year ago, and has grown rapidly, but remains in an experimental state as developers iron out stability and reliability issues. At present, sending or receiving a transaction still requires some technical understanding, which has made Lightning an unattractive option for entry-level users despite its time and cost benefits.Lightning\u2019s \u2018Best\u2019 Feature Yet?Sphinx, which Osuntokun says \u201callows users to start exploring a new set of use cases,\u201d aims to solve that predicament.It removes the need to create a payment invoice for a transaction, allowing more \u201cspontaneous\u201d activity and sidelining a major technical element potentially off-putting for novices.\u201cThis is only a draft implementation and while it works today on mainnet out of the box (if both sides are upgraded) much this will likely change,\u201d he added. Sphinx caps a frenetic development period for LN which continued throughout 2018. Despite fluctuations, capacity, node and channel numbers have all reached new highs in recent weeks.According to data from monitoring resource 1ML, Bitcoin Lightning\u2019s capacity is now 571 BTC ($2,076,000) among 5234 nodes and 19,500 channels.Sphinx meanwhile has already begun to see a warm reception, commentators variously saying it had attracted them to start using Lightning and that it was now the network\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d feature.What do you think about the Lightning Network\u2019s Sphinx?
