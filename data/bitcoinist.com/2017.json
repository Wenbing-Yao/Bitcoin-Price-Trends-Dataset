The Store presents potential token holders with promising ICOs that offer limited-time discounts.ICOBox co-founder, Nick Evdokimov, says that the idea of the Token Store is to grow the community of potential token holders by making available promising new tokens with no minimum or maximum purchase limits, while also offering the types of discounts that large-scale purchasers enjoy through typical ICOs. This should be a heads-up for potential token holders who normally may not be able to buy at the volumes that usually unlock attractive token discounts of 30% \u2013 75% through other ICOs.Evdokimov says:We want to give the token holder community greater access to promising tokens. In turn, companies managing their own ICOs have access through the Token Store to a much broader audience of token enthusiasts.ICOBox Introduces Connectius and INS EcosystemThe ICOBox Token Store introduces two ICOs this week at generous discounts available only through the Token Store platform. Connectius is a blockchain as a service solution (BaaS) that promises to do away with e-commerce fraud through its blockchain technology and enables any e-commerce store to interact directly with their customers via smart contracts. Almost everyone does some sort of shopping online, but they may not be aware of the types of fraud that traditional e-commerce is constantly battling.Up to 8% of e-commerce transactions are lost due to fraud, while another 60% of transactions are never completed. Connecitius\u2019 blockchain technology reduces these e-commerce weaknesses. Token purchasers can buy tokens directly from Connectius, which has a hard cap of 31,000,000, at USD $1.00. However, token buyers who purchase through ICOBox\u2019s Token Store have exclusive access to this innovative e-commerce technology at a 75% discount, where tokens are available for purchase for USD $0.25.The next Token Store offering is INS Ecosystem, which aims to disrupt how the general public buys its groceries through its blockchain solution. Their technology allows consumers to buy directly from manufacturers, cutting out bulky retailer intermediaries. INS Ecosystem expects to cut costs to consumers by eliminating waste, long-haul shipping, and big-box real estate requirements of traditional grocery retailers. INS says its smart contracts enable manufacturers to run bespoke loyalty programs and reward their customers with INS tokens. Token exchange will be available throughout the INS platform.This ICO has already reached 92% of its hard cap of 60,000 ETH. Tokens are available for 0.00333 ETH on the INS Ecosystem website, but make sure to check out the ICOBox Token Store where token purchasers can take advantage of a 33% discount at 0.0022222 ETH.Evdokimov points out that through the Token Store, \u201cwe\u2019ll be making even more in-depth choices regarding ICO projects that will be listed.\u201d This means ICOBox will undertake a meticulous selection process for potential ICOs that will be available on the Token Store site. Selected companies will offer their tokens on the site at a fixed rate for up to one month only, with various levels of discounts available. Potential token holders should be sure to visit store.icobox.io frequently to get access to amazing deals on interesting ICOs.What do you think of ICOBox\u2019s latest token offerings?

This morning, however, saw declines across the board during the Asian trading session, all except Ripple which bucked the trend again and saw gains.Bitcoin had rebounded a little from its previous slump to $12,000 but it was short-lived, the digital currency is going through another sell-off from a high of $16,900 yesterday down to $14,700 today and still falling. Ethereum has also pulled back a little to the $700 level, likewise with Bitcoin Cash which is down from $3,000 to $2,600. Litecoin which has been stable at $280 for a week has also dropped 12% in the past 24 hours falling to $250 at the time of writing.Ripple on a RollOne winner has again emerged, emulating its actions a week ago by knocking Bitcoin Cash (BCH) off the third spot in the market capacity charts. Ripple has gained a lot of attention in recent weeks, even Nasdaq reported on the altcoin\u2019s performance yesterday. In a sea of red down as far as Bitconnect at 18th, Ripple is the only coin showing green gains this morning.XRP has shown a shallow but steady upwards gradient over the past week rising from $0.89 to an all-time high of $1.47 according to analytics website Coinmarketcap. This is an impressive 65% gain over the period when most other altcoins, and even Bitcoin, has lost out. Its market capacity is currently $52 billion, whereas Bitcoin Cash has dropped to around $45 billion due to recent selloffs. Even news of today\u2019s SegWit2x BTC hard fork hasn\u2019t been able to bolster its prices as it did previously when people jumped on for free equivalent coins.Credit Card CredenceA lot rides on the news in crypto land and a coin can shed or gain double-digit percentages on fake news, FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt), or a pump from someone \u2018in the know\u2019 such as John McAfee. Verge is a prime example of this going both ways in the past seven days just on \u2018news\u2019.It has been good so far for Ripple. News yesterday that SBI Holdings and subsidiary SBI Ripple Asia would establish a consortium with a number of Japanese credit card companies using Ripple\u2019s blockchain has given the digital asset a further boost. Initially, the syndicate will be composed of three major credit card providers including JCB, Sumitomo Mitsui Card and Credit Saison.Ripple is often seen as being more stable and established than other cryptocurrencies. News that major financial institutions are also taking it seriously is keeping it pumped when all others are dumping.Is Ripple the coin that rules them all?

There are clear risks for investors and consumers associated to price volatility \u2013 including the risk of a complete loss of investment, operational and security failures, market manipulation, and liability gaps.Investor risk was a prime factor in China\u2019s recent crackdown on cryptocurrencies, exchanges and ICO\u2019s, although they are no doubt also aware of market manipulation and potential security failures too. Terrorist funding and capital flight are also prime concerns driving potential future action.Japan issues specific licenses for businesses to operate under, and whilst funding may be small outside of tradition finance, the Fintech industry is an area which nations are keen to not stifle or to be left behind on.How do you feel world governments are handling the impact of Bitcoin?

Sources also claimed that it was still trying to decide on how to hold the digital assets and how to manage security issues.The move will signal the first major Wall Street firm to enter the cryptocurrency markets and make them available to its clients. With CBOE and CME already onboard, and TD Ameritrade soon to allow the trading of both sets of contracts, the spotlight has already been shone Bitcoin\u2019s way. Other major financial institutions such as Citigroup and Bank of America are taking a more cautious approach and holding off until they see how current products perform in the volatile crypto market.Team BuildingReports by Fortune suggest that Goldman Sachs is assembling a team in New York but have yet to decide where to house the trading desk. It is possible that it will operate within the fixed-income, currencies and commodities unit\u2019s systematic trading function, which conducts transactions electronically according to sources familiar with the situation.Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said:In response to client interest in digital currencies, we are exploring how best to serve them.CEO Lloyd Blankfein has been more judicious stating in an earlier interview with Bloomberg that his bank did not need a Bitcoin strategy yet because the digital currency is still just developing and volatile.Market CorrectionAt the time of writing Bitcoin was trading at $14,488 according to CoinMarketCap, a fall of almost 30%, around $6,000, from its all-time high of just over $20k on Sunday. However, it should be noted that its current price is still 77.5% up on the same time last month.Many had predicted a bubble and imminent collapse but what is more likely is that the markets are correcting, traders are taking profit, and funds are going into alternatives such as Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ethereum. All the chart confirms is that Bitcoin still has a bumpy ride ahead and stability is a long way off.Will Bitcoin continue to fall or be buoyed by Goldman Sachs?

Just look at North Korea. The totalitarian, communist state has long used espionage attacks to harm their rivals (notably South Korea and Japan) while also looking to gain technological, military, and political information. Now their attacks have been going after Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to help bring in some much needed money into the state\u2019s empty coffers. Their latest attempt is that the country is using cryptocurrency phishing attacks to get their grubby mitts on some coins.Heading Down to the Phishing Hole to Catch Some CoinsThe phishing attacks by North Korea are targeting executives of cryptocurrency companies. As ZDNet reports, the attacks are being carried out by The Lazarus Group, a notorious hacker group that authorities believe to be strongly tied to the North Korean regime.The Lazarus Group has committed some notable crimes, such as the WannaCry ransomware attacks, hacking Sony, and stealing $81 million through cyberspace from the Bangladesh Central Bank. Their latest scam is sending crypto executives an email about an open Chief Financial Officer position that contains an infected Microsoft Word document.Don\u2019t Open That Attachment!One would hope that an executive for a cryptocurrency company would be savvy enough to not open an attachment from somebody that they don\u2019t know. If a person opened the document attachment, it would trigger malware that would enable access to the victim\u2019s computer.The email tells the victim that they need to enable editing to see the document. If the user does so, then the malware fires up. As the victim reads a decoy document for the fake CFO position, whose information is stolen directly from a LinkedIn posting, a remote access trojan is installed. Access is then gained and the hackers can go to work.Rafe Pilling, senior security researcher at Secureworks, says of these new phishing attacks:The interesting thing here is that the technique and the tactics being used since last summer mark a change in the nature of the lure and the nature of the targeting. Previously, Lazarus used defence-themed lures to target defence organisations, but now they\u2019re using bitcoin-themed lures to target financial companies.There\u2019s no word on if any of these phishing scams have been successful. The attacks started in late October and have been ongoing ever since.North Korea has been pretty active over the last couple of years in going after Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They\u2019ve gone after several South Korean exchanges, and they\u2019ve even gone heavily into Bitcoin mining. It\u2019s no secret that North Korea needs money, and the meteoric rise of Bitcoin gives them something extremely valuable that they can steal online. As long as virtual currencies continue to gain in value, you can bet North Korea will keep doing their best to steal as much as they can.What do you think about these cryptocurrency phishing attacks?

The advent of Bitcoin futures and the spectacular growth in the cryptocurrency\u2019s value are encouraging exchange-traded fund (ETF) providers to renew their efforts to obtain regulatory approval for vehicles that would track Bitcoin futures directly.Financial Entities Are Eager to Offer Bitcoin ETFsPotential ETF providers are now racing to obtain approval of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue ETFs in the U.S. Previously, the SEC rejected such petitions. For example, in March 2017, the SEC disapproved the Winklevoss twins\u2019 requests for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF (COIN).However, the launch of the CBOE Bitcoin futures contracts on December 10, 2017, and today\u2019s the rolling out of Bitcoin futures by the CME Group Inc. appear to confirm that the SEC requirements for a regulated framework have been satisfied. Ben Johnson, head of ETF research at Morningstar, said:The futures cover most of the SEC\u2019s concerns by creating a cleared, regulated financial instrument.Now that the trading of Bitcoin futures is well underway, financial institutions want to track Bitcoin futures directly. As the Financial Times explains:The launch of bitcoin derivatives by two big exchanges has encouraged potential ETF providers to push for approval of funds that would track bitcoin futures instead of the underlying cryptocurrency.Bitcoin Futures Snowball EffectThe launch of the CBOE Bitcoin futures has created a snowball effect in the financial markets. In fact, two days before the launch of CBOE Bitcoin futures, three fund managers each requested regulatory approval for Bitcoin ETFs: Van Eck Associates Corp., First Trust Advisors LP, and REX Shares LLC.TD Ameritrade is rushing to allow its clients to trade Bitcoin-based futures. In effect, TD Ameritrade starts trading Bitcoin futures as soon as the financial markets open on Monday, December 18, 2017.On the same date, the CME Group Inc., the largest derivatives exchange in the world, begins trading Bitcoin futures. As a result, financial experts believe Bitcoin\u2019s value and trading volumes will be boosted. As Reuters reports, Matt Osborne, chief investment officer of Altegris, explains:Volumes are going to slowly increase as professional traders get comfortable with the price action and more importantly get comfortable with the volatility and the margin usage.Bitcoin price performance will undoubtedly increase the snowball effect for ETFs and other Bitcoin-related vehicles.

The cryptocurrency has exploded this year, going from just around $1000 to the current value of $18,969. Few people made the Bitcoin prediction that it would rise so sharply, but Ronnie Moas of Standpoint Research did. Now he goes even farther and envisions that Bitcoin could reach as high as $400,000 and become the most valuable currency in the world.Future World Domination?In an interview with CNBC, Ronnie Moas was quite bullish on the future of Bitcoin. He says that the current frenzy about the virtual currency hitting $20,000 is just the launching point for something bigger. The analyst predicts that Bitcoin will go much higher, stating:Bitcoin is already up 500 percent since I recommended it in the beginning of July, and I\u2019m looking for another 500 percent move from here.He then added:The end-game on bitcoin is that it will hit $300,000 to $400,000 in my opinion, and it will be the most valuable currency in the world.Could Moas Be Right?The independent research analyst has been on target before concerning Bitcoin. When the cryptocurrency was trading for $2,600 last summer, he was the person who spoke up and said that it would reach $5,000 before the end of the year. He was right, even though he might have been surprised to see how quickly Bitcoin shot up in value over the last couple of months.As for his Bitcoin prediction, Moas is confident that the virtual currency will become the most valuable currency in the world. The reason for this is due to supply and demand. There\u2019s a limited supply of bitcoins, so the market will ensure that prices will go up as long as the demand is there.In this context, Moas says:I don\u2019t know how much gold there is in the ground, but I know how much bitcoin there is, and in two years there will be 300 million people in the world trying to get their hands on a few million bitcoin. This mind-boggling supply and demand imbalance is what is going to drive the price higher.Of course, not everyone agrees with this assessment. Vasu Menon of Singapore-based bank OCBC says that it\u2019s a risky move to believe that Bitcoin will reach $400,000 as he does not see any fundamental drivers for such a rally.However, Ronnie Moas is unperturbed and is doubling down. He says:I look at bitcoin the same way I look at Amazon .The way to play Amazon for the last 15 years was to buy it, hold it, and add on the dips.

James Levenson | Dec 18, 2017 | 00:45 Share Tweet Send Share The weekend\u2019s futures offerings by CME Group sent Bitcoin on a somewhat predictable surge up to $20,000 on some exchanges. According to CoinMarketCap, the daddy of crypto peaked at $20,089 on December 17th at 12.19 UTC. The market has since corrected where it has dropped back to around $19K. Unlike previous times, the altcoins did not suffer during this recent Bitcoin surge, and some, including Cardano, have done extremely well over the past few days.Cardano is one newcomer to the crypto scene that has made monumental growth in a very short time. If NEO is the Ethereum of China, then ADA is the Ethereum of Japan. In less than a week, it has emerged from relative obscurity to one of the top traded cryptocurrencies. With an over 400% increase since this time last week, Cardano has risen from just ten cents to over fifty.Cardano ClimbingIts market capacity is $12.5 billion at the time of writing, which has knocked Dash and Iota down the charts and put Cardano at sixth place, just behind Litecoin. ADA tokens are traded heavily on Bittrex, which has 60% of the total supply, while Binance follows with 35%. In the last 24 hours, a total volume of $549 million has been traded.With Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and now Dash costing over a thousand dollars a coin, some psychology comes into play, especially with new traders, according to Forbes. Sub-dollar coins are seen as better investments by those with limited trading experience on crypto and traditional markets. Several altcoins have \u201cgone to the moon\u201d in recent months, including XRP, IOTA, NEM, LTC, and ETH, and it seems that Cardano is about to join them.Ethereum Killer?Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) is the company behind Cardano. Co-founder Charles Hoskinson also worked very closely with Ethereum in its genesis. The primary ethos with Cardano is to develop an extension of Ethereum, addressing and solving the current scalability issues it has. Just like Ethereum and Neo, it is a platform that will run decentralized apps and smart contracts. It will work in layers, which gives the system the flexibility to be more easily maintained and allow for upgrades by way of soft forks.According to the website:This is the first blockchain project to be developed from a scientific philosophy, and the only one to be designed and built by a global team of leading academics and engineers. It is essential that the technology is secure, flexible and scalable for use by many millions of users. Consequently, considerable thought and care from some of the leading experts in their fields has been devoted to the project and informed design decisions.Cardano has a big future ahead, especially if it can provide solutions to current scalability issues on blockchains already in operation. It is currently trading at $0.48 after reaching an all-time high of $0.59 a few hours ago.Will ADA eclipse ETH and be the crypto platform of choice? Let us know in the comments below.

CME is a much larger exchange, so many expect it to have a bigger impact on the markets and the overall recognition and legitimization of Bitcoin and its brethren.The big daddy of digital currencies traded higher as expected and reached an all-time high once again on December 17th, just before CME opened its doors to traders. According to coin analysis website CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin reached $20,089 on December 17th at 12.19 UTC. The Chicago-based exchange got off to a quicker start with more efficient pricing, according to reports. CBOE futures are only tied to one BTC whereas CME\u2019s are based on five, which makes them far more valuable contracts.Smooth EntryThe contracts were priced only 2% higher than the actual Bitcoin price, which made trading them more effective than CBOE\u2019s, which were as much as 13% higher than the BTC price. According to CME data, over 200 contracts were sold for January 18th within the first hour of trading.Head of trading at Cumberland, the cryptocurrency trading unit of DRW Holdings LLC, Bobby Cho, said that people were better prepared and knew how they were going to hedge their positions, in comparison with last week\u2019s CBOE launch.There are some distinct differences with the two products. The price of CBOE\u2019s contract is derived from the cryptocurrency\u2019s price at a single exchange, and conversely, CME price calculations are based off four exchanges. According to Coindesk, the contracts have also continued trading at a premium against the price of Bitcoin since the opening. The website\u2019s Bitcoin Price Index had it priced at $19,400 at the time CME launched the contracts.Volatility ProtectionLarge exchanges such as these have volatility protection in place, which means they will suspend trading if the contracts rise or fall 7% or 13%, and prices won\u2019t be allowed to move more than 20%. This is to prevent wild price fluctuations in contract prices that are all too common with cryptocurrencies.Last week, TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation said that it will offer CBOE\u2019s contracts starting today but will hold on the CME contracts until they demonstrate sufficient liquidity.

Many Bitcoin investors are anticipating a rapid price movement once CME group launches its own Bitcoin futures contract this week.The Effects of Bitcoin FuturesBitcoin futures are currently one of the most popular topics in the Bitcoin and finance communities. In the last couple of weeks, many investors and traders were eagerly waiting for Bitcoin futures to officially start trading. Last week, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) officially launched its own Bitcoin futures contract for trading. Most traders speculated that Bitcoin would drastically lose value, as rumors spread that many institutional investors would try to short the decentralized cryptocurrency.On the first day of trading, the futures surged by 20% and 4,000 contracts were exchanged in total, a relatively low trading volume since the average is more than 100,000. Experts believe that the main reason for that is the uncertainty that clouds Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Many institutional investors are still struggling to fully understand Bitcoin and its technology, and thus hesitate to invest in the digital currency.Upcoming CME FuturesThe Chicago Board Options Exchange isn\u2019t the only entity that is launching a Bitcoin futures contract. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is also planning to launch Bitcoin futures in the upcoming week. Analysts believe that the CME will be able to bring in more trading volume and perhaps further influence the price of Bitcoin. In a recent Reuters article, Matt Osborne, chief investment officer of Altegris stated following regarding CME\u2019s Bitcoin futures contract:The CME contract is based on a broader array of exchanges. So there is a possibility that the CME contract may generate more interest and more volume. It\u2019s important to keep that in mind when (investors) are trying to make a decision.He also added:Volumes are going to slowly increase as professional traders get comfortable with the price action and more importantly get comfortable with the volatility and the margin usage,It will definitely be interesting to see how high CME\u2019s trading volume will be. Traders are anticipating strong price movements once the futures officially start trading on the CME.

There is no regulation, no protection, and no safety net, but for many, this is the appeal. However, what if there was a coin that had the best of both worlds: some stability and regulation but all of the technical advantages of the blockchain network?The concept of a stablecoin is one that has real world value in either fiat or solid assets. The newest altcoin to the crypto scene to attempt this is Tether, which is pegged to the US dollar. The notion is that Tether could be used as a proxy for fiat on crypto exchanges. Unfortunately for the developers, it was compromised recently, leading to the loss of $30 million from a \u201cmalicious action by an external attacker.\u201dStability BenefitsState-issued virtual coins pegged to their national currency would be one way to curb the rampaging volatility that crypto markets suffer, according to a Forbes report. The idea is that they would restore market confidence and bring more users into the ecosystem that would otherwise be fearful of these huge price fluctuations and unpredictability. It would appeal to governments more so as they can monitor transactions and curtail tax evasion and money laundering activities.This largely goes against the ethos and appeal of cryptocurrency, which is decentralized and beyond the control of governments, central banks, and regulators. The fears are that the social costs of large-scale anonymous financial crimes would be too high and eliminating central banks could result in an economic global meltdown.The Race Is OnState-issued cryptocurrencies could bridge the gap between bank-controlled fiat and fully anonymous digital assets and trading. Some countries are already on the way in creating and launching their own national virtual currencies. Russia is planning to launch its own CryptoRuble, and Sweden\u2019s central bank is proposing the e-Krona. Likewise, China is working hard on creating its own national cryptocurrency in an effort to keep capital from leaving the country, and Kyrgyzstan is planning to launch a coin based on gold.Singapore, which is also seeking its own digital currency, announced the launch of Project Ubin last year, a payment system prototype running on the Ethereum platform. It is aimed at enabling local inter-bank transactions using a tokenized Singaporean dollar, while South Korea and Japan have recently trialed systems running on Ripple\u2019s XRP token, which is somewhere in-between.Nations that are successful with their own stablecoin would be able to use the system in tandem with their existing financial institutions and other cryptocurrencies, without having to enforce harsh regulations and asphyxiate the innovation that the blockchain has brought to the table this year.Will stablecoins ever take off or are they a threat to decentralization?

The new app, KYC.LEGAL DELIVERY, will be available in App Store and Google Play in the coming weeks. This app will allow users to order agent verification and a courier service for the delivery of legal documents. To implement the second stage of its service, KYC.LEGAL has established a joint venture with the Mesto delivery company.The addition of agent verification and a courier service makes KYC.LEGAL a fully-functional application. While self-verification is sufficient in some instances, many \u201cknow your customer\u201d (KYC) verification procedures require that a third-party agent confirm and authenticate a user\u2019s identity. Using the new KYC.LEGAL DELIVERY app, users will be able to order onsite verification by one of KYC.LEGAL\u2019s certified agents, who are selected based on a thorough vetting procedure. The app will link the person requesting verification services with the nearest agent, who will arrive at the place of the user\u2019s choosing within 30 minutes. The agent verification process is performed using KYC tokens; after each use, the verification capability of a KYC token is deactivated for a month.KYC.LEGAL Founder Daniil Rausov states:As the digital revolution continues, KYC services are becoming more and more essential. According to our research, 100,000 blockchain users undergo KYC procedure every day. [\u2026] We are committed to making this process as quick and user-friendly as possible. With the completion and rollout of the second stage of the app, we have the most comprehensive KYC product on the market. Now, regardless of the level of user verification required, our app is all you will need to make the process as painless as possible.The second function offered through the new app is a courier service. KYC.LEGAL entered into a partnership with the Mesto delivery company to provide courier services. Based on the agreement signed today, its couriers will ensure the delivery of documents from verified users to banks, insurance companies, credit institutions and others in major cities throughout the world. The joint venture\u2019s service area will cover more than 50 countries in Europe and Asia, as well as the USA. The service can even be used for the delivery of credit cards and passports. As with agent verification, the courier service will run on KYC tokens.Nick Evdokimov, Strategy Director of KYC.LEGAL and Co-Founder of ICOBox, comments:The user verification market has been in dire need of a product that offers speed, security, and convenienceHe continues:That is exactly what KYC.LEGAL and KYC.LEGAL DELIVERY bring to the table. Using these apps, KYC verification takes a half hour, instead of days. As a product based on blockchain technology, it ensures the security of personal data, which will only be stored on the user\u2019s device, and makes it possible for users to provide only the information required. It also offers the convenience of user verification from the comfort of home.To take advantage of all the services provided by the KYC.LEGAL and KYC.LEGAL DELIVERY apps, you must be a KYC token holder. The KYC token will work the same way on both apps. Token holders will be able to offer discounts on services based on the revenue split that they establish for their active tokens. Users will be in a position to benefit from discounts on the delivery of legal documents, just as they are on agent verification. The company\u2019s ICO is underway and will run until February 15, 2018, or until all the tokens are sold.Do you think KYC.LEGAL\u2019s new app and courier service will be well received by mainstream businesses?

He\u2019s known primarily for applying this approach to his trades while at Legg Mason, the US investment management firm with close to three-quarters of a trillion dollars under management, where he served as a fund manager for more than 35 years.Bill Miller Not As Boring As We Thought, Really Hoping Bitcoin Analyst Is Right https://t.co/tMXIk59uxe\u2014 Bruno J. Navarro (@Bruno_J_Navarro) December 18, 2017Miller Value PartnersAfter leaving Mason, he founded Miller Value Partners, which now controls what\u2019s called the MVP1 fund, a hedge fund that, at the end of October, had around $155 million in assets under management and that serves as the flagship fund for Miller Value.This week, Miller told CNBC that bitcoin accounts for around half of the total assets under management in the MVP1 fund. At the above mentioned total asset value estimate, that\u2019s around $77 million. However, back then, bitcoin represented 30% of the fund, meaning at that point the bitcoin he holds was worth about $46 million. Given that Bitcoin was priced in and around $7,000 at the end of October and is now up to just shy of $19,000 a piece, a circa 171% run, the bitcoin in the MVP1 fund should now be worth somewhere in the region of $125 million.An Exercise In Risk MitigationFor a fund to have one single asset account for 50% of its total value is unheard of but it\u2019s important to remember here that Miller hasn\u2019t just acquired these bitcoin to a total representation of 50%. When he first bought them, they represented single-digit percentage points of the fund. It\u2019s only the rise in price that has caused this skewed representation. In other words, he\u2019s not bought any more bitcoin, bitcoin has just outperformed every other asset that the fund contains \u2013 and by a huge margin.So what happens now?According to reports, Muller is looking for a way to reduce the fund\u2019s exposure to the single asset but has as yet not decided how he\u2019s going to achieve this. It\u2019s not unreasonable to assume he\u2019ll need to sell some bitcoin to do so (given that the only other way would be to dilute the bitcoin concentration through an increased total asset value or, in other words, by adding more money to the fund) but Miller won\u2019t confirm this:What we\u2019re studying is ways in which we can mitigate risk to the overall fund and the portfolio\u2026 It won\u2019t be 50 percent of the fund for that much longer, which does not mean necessarily that we\u2019re going to be selling it.What other methods of risk reduction can you think of for Miller\u2019s fund?

Founded in 1999, the G20 comprises the governments and central bank chiefs of the world\u2019s major economies: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, and the European Union.European Countries Continue Push to Regulate BitcoinOn December 15th, 2017, France and other members of the European Union agreed to impose regulatory controls on cryptocurrency exchanges in an effort to prevent money laundering, tax evasion, and financing of terrorism. In this regard, Europe\u2019s Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said:Today\u2019s agreement will bring more transparency to improve the prevention of money laundering and to cut off terrorist financing.Specifically, some of the restrictive measures require platforms that transfer Bitcoin and \u201cwallet\u201d providers that hold cryptocurrencies for clients to identify their users. The measures also allow national investigators more access to information, including national bank account registers.For a while, due to Bitcoin\u2019s explosive growth, French authorities have been mulling over how to regulate the cryptocurrency. For example, in October 2017, Robert Oph\u00e8le, the chief of the French stock market regulatory agency, the AMF (Authorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers), outlined that the priorities of his agency included: managing Brexit\u2019s effects on European markets, boosting the attractiveness of Paris to the financial world, and better regulating Bitcoin. Oph\u00e8le explained:There are various issues behind this. Cryptocurrencies can be very easily the receptacle of all that one wants to avoid: tax evasion, money laundering or the financing of terrorism. But it also meets more legitimate needs for cash transfers in a fast and cost-free way in the world. The financial industry is paying close attention.As Bitcoin grows, governments and bankers are getting more concerned and calling for stricter regulations. However, Bitcoin is, and will remain, censorship-resistant.What do you think about the potential impact of the G20\u2019s debate about Bitcoin regulations?

During the execution of the warrant, Kaplan\u2019s premises were searched, during which time the SSU agents confiscated a number of personal items including a notebook and several cold storage devices.The reason given for the search was a criminal case involving a group of Ukranian and US nationals who were engaging in fraudulent activities involving bank cards. Specifically, the warrant alleged that suspects \u201cexchanged Bitcoin to hryvna (Ukrainian national currency) using online service Forklog.\u201dForklog sources have expressed their bewilderment over the charges, insisting that the company has never provided such services and, indeed, does not even have the kind of software and equipment that would be needed. Furthermore, none of the suspects involved in the case have been shown to have any connection whatsoever with Forklog or its founder.The Search Takes a Disturbing TurnIn what is one of the most disturbing aspects of this situation, Kaplan asserts that one of the SSU agents attempted to transfer his bitcoins from his own storage devices to an unspecified address right in the middle of the search. The agent\u2019s actions were stopped only when Kaplan\u2019s lawyer called the police, alleging robbery.The next day, however, approximately 305 ETH ($221, 734 USD) was transferred from Kaplan\u2019s wallet \u2013 which was still in SSU custody at the time \u2013 to a newly created wallet. Kaplan also reported a failed attempt by an unknown party to withdraw 3,000 hryvna ($110) from his bank account using his personal bank card.Kaplan issued the following statement on the incident:I believe that this strange situation perfectly illustrates one of the possible scenarios for the state-cryptocommunity relationship. That is why we decided to make it public. It\u2019s not as much about protecting my personal interests as it is about protecting the interests of the entire community. This sends a warning to everyone who is in any way connected to blockchain technologies. It does not matter if you are a public figure.Right now we are trying to return what we believe was unlawfully seized from us. We find the attempts to transfer cryptocurrencies to wallets controlled by SSU agents to be an extremely strange practice. Other than ETH, large sums in several other cryptocurrencies were moved to freshly created wallets. As to Bitcoin wallets, the situation is not quite clear yet. During the search my lawyer has detected a score of other procedural violations, including turning off the camera.At the same time that Kaplan\u2019s personal residence was being searched, Forklog\u2019s office in Odessa was also being searched. Confiscated during the search were 10 iMacs, all available cash, and a bottle of Kraken rum.#forklog is under the pressure in #Ukraine ! All #cryptocurrencies and office equipment confiscated by government. Hold on guys!\u2014 crypto_profi (@CryptoProfi) December 18, 2017Help ArrivesArtem Afian, managing partner at Juscutum law firm, promptly expressed his firm\u2019s intent to provide Kaplan with legal assistance. Afian insists that this incident is extremely significant for the entire crypto community:Financial regulators might still be on the fence regarding cryptocurrency, not being ready to even legally define it yet. But at the same time Ukrainian law enforcement shows that cryptocurrency is a valuable enough asset to conduct an occasional raid in search for it. Traditionally searches and raids conducted on New Year\u2019s eve are linked to jewelry shop heists. But this year cryptocurrency is trending. Afian also added:We have no reason to doubt that this search was completely useless in regards to the criminal case in question. By the same logic you could accuse a news channel of gun trafficking on the premise of it running a story about gun trafficking.Speaking about the events leading up to the search, Afian highlighted the fact that the search was sanctioned only after an investigator made the claim that cryptocurrencies were being exchanged using Forklog. He bluntly asserted that the investigator\u2019s claim is a result of \u201ceither blatant incompetence or deliberate obfuscation of facts.\u201d He also noted that these searches were a well-known tactic of Ukranian law enforcement before the reform (pre-Euromaidan).As to the next steps to be taken, Afian concluded:We expect a prompt and proper reaction from the authorities and swift return of seized iMacs. As to the return of seized cryptocurrency and SSU agents\u2019 legal liability, I can only say that this will be a highly emblematic and evincive case.What do you think of this latest development? Will we see more questionable searches and seizures of crypto assets as governments struggle to figure out how to address cryptocurrency?

Oh, how the tide has turned! Digital currencies, and Bitcoin, in particular, have seen not just a growth in price, but also in popularity.It\u2019s also moved out of the shadow realm of the financial industry, basking in the light of futures trading. Both CBOE and CME have launched their products, and Nasdaq will also be following suit in 2018, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a viable financial asset.Hello Mainstream AdoptionIn fact, according to Jonathan Johnson, president of Medici Ventures and a board member of Overstock, mainstream integration of digital currencies is set to increase in the not-too-distant future.In a recent conversation with TheStreet, Johnson had this to say:We see increased cryptocurrency purchases on the Overstock website. Crypto adoption is happening.Blockchain Technology Can Offer Financial InclusionThe site showcased its crypto enthusiasm by accepting the digital currency as payment in 2014. Since then, it has welcomed the advancement of blockchain technology with open arms, with its Medici Ventures subsidiary responsible for managing investments in companies providing various blockchain-based solutions.Johnson went on to add:Cryptocurrencies are going to be a way for people around the globe to participate in the global economy, particularly those that are currently unbanked.This would be quite the achievement as approximately 38% of the world in unbanked according to the World Bank.The lower the percentage of unbanked per country, the faster that crypto adoption could happen. Top of the list for possible speedy integration is the US, as it only has a 7% to 8% unbanked population. These figures increase exponentially in developing nations with the Caribbean sitting at 40%, South America at 70% and Africa at 90%.Currently, about half of the world has access to the Internet. However, that number is increasing every year. As it grows, so does the viability of using blockchain technology to cater to the needs of the unbanked population.Johnson commented:A digital currency, whether it\u2019s a fiat currency or a cryptocurrency, is going to be a real life changer for people that don\u2019t have bank accounts.#Financial Bitcoin Could Become the Global Currency of the Future: Overstock's Johnson https://t.co/uU7gCGgtkm\u2014 Wall Street Wire (@WaIlstreetWire) December 18, 2017Circumventing Cash ControlBecause it is digital and decentralized, cryptocurrencies do not belong to any one government or entity, allowing it to bypass traditional regulations and procedures. It is also not subject to the results of political elements which could pave the way for inflation.Johnson explained a bit further:Unlike government-issued fiat dollars, many of the cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin, in particular, are capped at the number of coins that will ever be mined. So, they\u2019re not subject to continual inflation through central bank printing.Bitcoin\u2019s dramatic price surges have had industry experts calling it a bubble, but its possible burst is irrelevant, according to Johnson:Not being a trader, but being a believer in the underlying technology and also what Bitcoin is, I don\u2019t spend any time thinking about when is it hitting top, when is it going to plunge. My view is long term it will have great value, so for me, I\u2019m a buy-and-hold person.Johnson concluded that:In the coming years, blockchain will affect everyone, even if they don\u2019t understand it.Do you see a future with digital currencies being the preferred medium of exchange?

Many of them do just that including Ethereum, NEO, Substratum, OmiseGO, Power Ledger, Factom, Iota and TenX to name a few. Then there are those that are just currencies such as Bitcoin and Litecoin which can also be outstanding investment opportunities as we have seen in recent months.What is a mystery is the amount of investment that has gone into cryptos that do not really offer anything aside from a blockchain. According to an article on Wall Street Journal investors have already spent $700 million on a tech startup offering a digital token which they themselves state has no purpose.FOMO FlashesThe company, Block.one, raised the funds during the ICO which has come at a time of mass crypto mania and big doses of FOMO (fear of missing out). The report went on to claim that the Cayman Islands-registered company develops software via an open source website; it has created a blockchain platform that does not really offer anything beyond the thousands that already exist in the crypto sphere.The website offers a pretty standard \u2018we are a scalable decentralized app platform\u2019 statement with a basic white paper and a few team photos. They have been auctioning 2 million tokens every day to raise funds for the ICO. The EOS core code is posted publically and the company released a new version of it last week causing a now commonly seen spike in price that usually follows altcoin news.Toothless TokenOnce the platform is released the EOS tokens that have no real relationship to it will serve no purpose. Block.one only intends to write the base code and let third-party developers do the rest. The WSJ states that a purchase agreement which investors must sign states the tokens \u201cdo not have any rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features.\u201d In this way, the token seems like the proverbial \u201cwhite elephant\u201d \u2013 expensive to own but serving no purpose.The current buying frenzy just shows that people are still willing to invest in concepts that are being built for a technological market that doesn\u2019t exist yet. With a market capacity of $5.1 billion EOS is one of the top altcoins of the moment, sitting at 14th place in the crypto cap charts. It has jumped over 450% this month from $1.97 to an all-time high today of $11.11, market corrections have seen the price fall back a little but it is clearly evident that traders are still going crypto nuts.Is EOS just another useless \u201cwhite elephant\u201d of a token or will it eventually have some purpose?

And while you may or may not have high praise for the bill, one thing is certain: the new tax code is bad news for cryptocurrency investors. Starting Jan. 1st, 2018, all cryptocurrency trades will be a taxable event, including swapping one cryptocurrency for another.Closing the 1031 LoopholeThe recent overhaul amends a part of the tax code regarding exemptions for \u201clike kind exchanges,\u201d allowing investors to swap similar assets without triggering a tax event. These so-called \u201c1031 exchanges\u201d have long been used by traders to exchange property, such as art or real estate, without having to pay taxes on it.Since March 2014, the IRS has treated Bitcoin and other digital currencies as property for tax purposes. This makes them subject to capital gains tax, requiring taxes be paid whenever crypto is exchanged for fiat currency (ie. cash).Coins held for less than a year are subject to regular income tax, which can range anywhere from 10 to 37 percent, depending upon personal income levels. Coins held for longer than one year are subject to long-term capital gains tax, which caps at around 24 percent.However, it has never been clear whether a trade between two different cryptocurrencies qualifies as a \u201clike kind exchange.\u201d Up until this point, cryptocurrency trades have typically resided in this legal gray area, granting most traders a loophole for deferring taxes on short-term capital gains.However, the new amendment definitively narrows the 1031 exemption to only cover real estate swaps, excluding Bitcoin entirely. It specifically limits the scope of the law from previously covering \u201cproperty\u201d to now only covering \u201creal property.\u201d And as a digital asset, cryptocurrency is about as far from \u201creal property\u201d as one can get.The end result is that, starting next year, effectively all cryptocurrency trades will be taxed at the time of their execution, bringing an end to one of the most lucrative tax loopholes previously available to traders.Death, Taxes, and CryptocurrencyThis change marks a significant blow for U.S. cryptocurrency investors. Although trades between fiat currency and crypto have previously been taxed, the vast majority of trading which occurs between separate cryptocurrencies has flown under the radar.Although traders are expected to pay taxes once they \u201ccash out\u201d or trade their coins for goods and services, swapping between cryptocurrencies has allowed investors to defer their tax obligation for short-term capital gains. Now investors will no longer be able to avoid income tax on these trades without holding onto a specific cryptocurrency for over a year.What remains to be seen is whether users will actually heed the law, as many U.S. investors already have an notoriously bad habit of avoiding taxes on their Bitcoin profits. From 2013 to 2015, the IRS discovered that fewer than 1,000 people in the U.S. had paid taxes on their bitcoins each year, prompting a controversial lawsuit against Coinbase, demanding they hand over all user transactions from those years.Tensions with the IRS will likely only get worse next year should Bitcoin investors continue to shirk their tax obligations. Gains of nearly $14,000 in Bitcoin this year alone will likely spell billions of dollars of missed tax revenue for the IRS should Americans choose to cheat the taxman again next spring.Do you think that the new amendment is fair towards Bitcoin users?

ETH is up almost 140% from the same time last month, and market capacity is almost at $80 billion.Omise on the GoSince many altcoins are based on the Ethereum platform, their success largely depends on it doing well. Once such digital asset that has rode on the back of Ethereum\u2019s rise, and the words of its creator, is OmiseGO. In a post last week, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin endorsed OmiseGO by tweeting:Right now my favorite token model is OMG-style staking tokens.OMG works on a delegated proof-of-stake, which involves validating the network through running nodes that can be voted for. According to reports, rewards are distributed in a democratized way through the ability to vote for which node to validate the transaction. Rewarding good performers and down-voting poor ones should achieve some form of balance on the network and incentivize everyone to perform well.OmiseGO views blockchain as a data revolution and not so much a storage ledger as in the Bitcoin model. Its cryptographic processes are designed to process data which will bring new opportunities for IT infrastructures and companies other than just financially-based organizations. OMG is big in Asia, especially Thailand, where payment trials are currently in operation with companies such as McDonalds. The ethos is to provide those without a bank account a safe and secure wallet for digital transactions.Up and RunningOMG is already processing payments, and the system is not new to the crypto scene; it was founded in 2013. Transactions are currently taking place, and more organizations are set to test the technology in the coming months when wallet SDKs and the plasma architecture are to be rolled out. Overall, OMG has a solid roadmap for next year.OmiseGO has gained an extraordinary 4000% since mid-year. Trading as a sub-dollar coin back in July, it has now topped an all-time high of $20.56 just a few minutes ago. Market capacity is just over $2 billion, and the total supply is just 140 million, with over 100 million already out there. Omise still has a long way to GO in 2018.How far will Omise GO next year?

As the daddy of all crypto began to shoot up in value, people began to take notice. Headlines were made again and again as another price barrier was broken. So, how hot was the virtual currency in 2017? Google Trends released their list of the top trending topics for 2017, and Bitcoin Google searches came in at number two on their global news list.People Interested in BitcoinIt seemed that every time you turned around, people and media were talking about Bitcoin. On the economic front, many financial institutions were very negative towards cryptocurrency, even though they were intrigued by the possibilities and applications of blockchain technology. Yet as the year wore on, more and more banks, investment companies, and Wall Street firms began to become an active part of the crypto world.It appears that the main driver of interest in Bitcoin was its increasing jump in price. Looking at the Google Trends page for the cryptocurrency, you can see (image shown below) that searches were mostly steady throughout the year but began to climb in August when the price began to really go up. Then searches exploded in late November as Bitcoin went from $8,000 to $10,000 and then much, much higher.We\u2019re Number Two! Wait\u2026Who\u2019s Number One?Bitcoin came in at an extremely respectable number two on the Google Trends global news list. It beat out topics like the solar eclipse, North Korea, and the horrific Las Vegas shooting that left 58 innocent people dead and a staggering 546 injured.So what beat out Bitcoin for the top spot for global news in 2017? The answer to that is Hurricane Irma. This makes perfect sense as the Category 5 hurricane wreaked so much havoc, inflicting $66.77 billion in damages and killing 134 people. Places like Puerto Rico, Cuba, Florida, and Saint Martin lost power for weeks (and Puerto Rico is still recovering). Personally, I was hit by the hurricane and lost power for over a week.As we stagger towards the end of the year, Bitcoin continues to make the news on a daily basis. The new narrative is that the cryptocurrency is in hot water due to its recent slump, which is nonsense as Bitcoin has always had a recovery after a major drop as the market corrects itself. Then there are stories about people forgetting their keys to their wallets, causing them to take desperate measures, such as hypnotism. Plus, it seems each week brings another exchange getting hacked or some government or business being saddled with ransomware demands for bitcoins. It\u2019ll be fascinating to see what lies ahead for Bitcoin in the coming year.What do you think about Bitcoin coming in at number two for the global news list for Google Trends?

SingularityNET is a decentralized marketplace for artificial intelligence, and it may well have the record for the fastest selling ICO ever.According to reports, the ICO was sold out within 60 seconds of going public, raising $36 million for the company behind the ambitious project. The team at Singularity reports that the crowdfunding was capped after receiving $361 million in investor interest on its whitelist from more than 20,000 previous investors.Future PlansThe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) tokens will power the SingularityNET framework that will allow companies, organizations, and developers to buy and sell AI, lowering costs and increasing output. According to their website:Experts estimate that AI market will increase from the $200 billion it is valued today to $3.1 trillion by 2025, but serious roadblocks remain. Today, AI functionality is expensive, time-consuming, and hard to use.Dr. Ben Goertzel, the CEO, said in response to the ICO:Today\u2019s results are powerful evidence that SingularityNET is an idea whose time has come. In discussing the SingularityNET project all around the world, I\u2019ve found that it resonates remarkably with people from all walks of life, and the enthusiasm we\u2019ve seen in our community is awe-inspiring.The overall vision is to combine AI and blockchain to create a decentralized marketplace for different types of AI, and the aim is to become the key open-source protocol for networking AI on the internet.Company VisionIn an interview with TechCrunch, Goertzel went on to state:Proprietary marketplaces exist, like the Amazon Web Services for instance. What we\u2019re creating here is a decentralized marketplace, more like BitTorrent. There\u2019s no central dictator deciding what gets in there. Anyone can put an AI online, wrap it in our API, and announce it to the network and any business that needs AI as a service can request it.He went on to add that the company wants to make the system so that the AI layer is independent of what blockchain they are using. The prototype uses Ethereum, but it is too slow, and they want to be able to swap out the blockchain technology easily.The overwhelming response to the ICO is a clear indicator that investors are taking blockchain technology seriously, and there will be more to come.What do you think about the SingularityNET selling out in 60 seconds?

Now, new evidence has emerged appearing to bolster those allegations.Entrepreneur and cryptocurrency enthusiast Albert Renshaw is claiming that he has discovered additional evidence pointing to insider trading of Bitcoin Cash related to its recent adoption by Coinbase and their cryptocurrency exchange, GDAX.Speaking with Forbes, Renshaw states:I\u2019ve found and isolated one instance of insider trading on BCH addition to GDAX/Coinbase.He references the following discussion thread that took place on /r/Coinbase:The highlighted comments in the thread have since been deleted, however, the conversation was archived in its entirety at Archive.is.Timeline of EventsThe screenshot above focuses primarily on the comments of one Redditor, /u/mukiwa2. The conversation was archived on December 20, 2017, making the \u20182 days ago\u2019 time stamp (see mukiwa2\u2019s first highlighted comment) December 18 \u2013 a day before Coinbase announced their addition of Bitcoin Cash.December 18Bitcoin Cash is trading between $1900 \u2013 $2200 (CoinMarketCap)./u/mukiwa2 announces to the thread that Bitcoin Cash is coming to Coinbase and that he has \u201ca mate at CB\u201d.December 19Coinbase announces the addition of Bitcoin Cash.Bitcoin Cash begins trading on GDAX at 10:20 pm EST.Within minutes the price of BCH jumps to $8500 \u2013 more than double the previous day\u2019s price.GDAX suspends trading at 10:22 pm EST, later tweeting, \u201cAll BCH books will enter cancel-only mode, and all existing orders will be cleared. While in cancel-only mode, no new orders will be accepted. We will post an update shortly.\u201dDecember 20GDAX resumes Bitcoin Cash trading.Between /u/mukiwa2\u2019s comment on Reddit and the opening of trade on GDAX, the price of Bitcoin Cash jumped by over 370%. To put that in perspective, if a person bought $50,000 worth of BCH at $1900 on December 18 and was able to sell it as soon as trading opened on December 19 at $8500, they would have made a profit $223,684, less their initial investment.So Who is /u/mukiwa2?Well, that\u2019s where things start to get murky. Nobody knows. Shortly after the crypto community began calling Coinbase out over possible insider trading, /u/mukiwa2 deleted his comments from the thread. Shortly thereafter, he deleted his account entirely. Bitcoinist was able to dig up a cached copy of his Redditor profile page, but that provided little information other than the fact that it was a new account, created on December 6, 2017.Some further research yielded some possible clues to his identity, and Bitcoinist has reached out to this person for confirmation and possible comment. At the time of this writing, we have received no response.So What Happens Next?In the wee hours of the morning on December 20, Coinbase issued a statement via Twitter that all of its employees have been prohibited from trading Bitcoin Cash for several weeks. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong addressed the matter personally, as well. In a blog post published on the same day, Armstrong clarified Coinbase\u2019s employee trading policy and also addressed the accusations of insider trading, stating:Given the price increase in the hours leading up the announcement, we will be conducting an investigation into this matter. If we find evidence of any employee or contractor violating our policies \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 I will not hesitate to terminate the employee immediately and take appropriate legal action.This is all well and good, but it\u2019s a little bit like shutting the barn door after the horse has already bolted. It doesn\u2019t change what happened, if insider trading did, indeed, take place, and it doesn\u2019t prevent it from happening again in the future with some other coin on some other exchange.Coinbase maintains a strict trading policy and internal guidelines for employees. Coinbase employees have been prohibited from trading in Bitcoin Cash for several weeks.\u2014 Coinbase (@coinbase) December 20, 2017While it is heartening that Armstrong isn\u2019t simply dismissing the accusations, the whole idea of an internal investigation being offered up as a panacea should be concerning to the entire crypto community. If a non-crypto investment firm were accused of insider trading, there would be no self-policing. The SEC would investigate the company and, if found guilty, the parties responsible would face fines and most likely jail time.The crypto community is at a crossroad. On the one hand, they don\u2019t want regulators mucking about and trying to control things. On the other hand, when something goes wrong \u2013 like an exchange being hacked or insider trading \u2013 they clamor for the protection that only regulation would provide. There is no simple solution, but one thing is clear \u2013 we can\u2019t have it both ways.Does this new information change your opinion on Coinbase\u2019s involvement (or lack of involvement) in insider trading?

This was in response to escalating Bitcoin transaction fees during the big sell off. However, just two days later, the provider backpedaled to restore the previous minimum of $5.Last week saw Bitcoin\u2019s biggest selloff this year, even bigger than the Chinese ICO ban in September. The crypto coin dumped 40% of its value in a matter of days, and the digital avalanche took most of the altcoins with it. When mass selling occurs, the exchanges get overwhelmed and transaction speeds grind seemingly to a halt. Conversely, the cost of sending or receiving Bitcoin escalates.BitPay RespondsAccording to reports, the initial decision was explained on BitPay\u2019s blog:The Bitcoin network has been seeing record transaction volume in the last few weeks. This growth has also led to record network congestion and record-high bitcoin miner fees. Bitcoin miner fees are now more than $30 per transaction on average. To protect purchasers and to continue to offer service for Bitcoin payments, we are now requiring a new invoice minimum payment amount of $100 on all BitPay invoices.Frustration reigned as traders tried to sell off their Bitcoin amid a market slide. However, the \u2018hodlers\u2019 were the victors as the coin has since rebounded back up to $15,000.BacktrackingAs the markets settled, the payments provider retracted the limit, returning it to its previous level of $5. In an updated post on Saturday, it stated that payment protocol improvements facilitated the implementation of the lower limit:Our recent Payment Protocol improvements to the BitPay payment experience have effectively eliminated these payment mistakes. This has allowed us to make $5 or greater invoices available once again. Many invoice payments under $100 may still be uneconomical for bitcoin purchasers due to high bitcoin network fees. However, they again have the option to send these smaller payments if they choose.To lower costs even further, BitPay is working towards implementing SegWit to their network:We will be working in the coming months to implement Segregated Witness (Segwit) in various parts of our platform. Segregated Witness reduces the size of bitcoin transactions, allowing for an average bitcoin miner fee reduction of over 40%.Users are urging the rapid implementation for fee reduction, but BitPay has still not made the change four months after it has been activated on the Bitcoin network.Are you a BitPay user?

But just recently, the fork is set to launch again.The ResurrectionThe announcement was made on December 16th, with the fork date set for December 28th. Some Segwit2x futures markets are still live on some exchanges, and this attempts to finish the project that was started. HitBTC and YoBit are already supporting the fork, saying that the people who\u2019ve purchased B2X tokens receive their coins.The fork is not the same as the one originally proposed in the NYA but shares some features. The most important part of the Segwit2x fork is the increased block size to 4MB, double what the original proposal called for. It also decreases the block production time from ten minutes to two and a half minutes. It has built-in replay protection along with its own unique address format. The fork already has a planned roadmap, with a functioning Lightning Network and Anonymous transactions to be coming in the next year.Redistributing Old CoinsThe one point about the fork that raises some concerns is that the developers plan to redistribute the coins from the very beginning of bitcoin that are assumed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto is assumed to be in control of just around one million bitcoins, which will be revoked and given to current Bitcoin holders proportionate to their holdings. The developers have stated that the reason for this airdrop will be a \u201creward for the progress commitment.\u201dThis fork is coming in a long line of random Bitcoin forks. Ever since the Bitcoin Gold fork back in October, a bunch of random Bitcoin forks have come to light. Bitcoin Silver, Bitcoin Platinum, and other silly names have plagued the market. The fork has yet to be listed on any other exchanges, and other than a single press release not much media coverage has marketed the soon to be fork.What do you think about this fork?

Many of those getting into crypto now are novices to trading and cyber security, and those are the ones at greatest risk of losing their digital stash to hackers.We\u2019ve already learned last week of malware infecting Facebook\u2019s messenger service on desktops. The software is designed to harness computing power to mine Monero without the user knowing or consenting. This is effectively theft of the victim\u2019s hardware and power resources to profit the attackers. While powerful desktop PCs are a prime target, mining malware has also emerged on mobile phones. So, if yours has slowed down, it could be under attack.Malware RisingAccording to a report in the Economic Times, browser-based mining has been around since 2013 but has exploded this year with the upsurge of interest in crypto. Cybersecurity firm Symantec has reported a 34% increase in the number of mobile apps incorporating the code to mine virtual currencies, so it is making an appearance on smartphones too.According to researchers at Symantec:After many years of deathly silence, the catalyst appears to be the launch of a new browser-based mining service in Sept by Coinhive.Coinhive allows website owners to insert code that will mine crypto from its readers. Totally unethical, but webmasters are doing it as it can generate a better revenue stream than selling their products online.Mobile MadnessResearchers from the Russian-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky have investigated another strain of malware, dubbed Loapi, which they found hiding in applications in the Android mobile operating system. With some top end phones boasting multi-core processors and upwards of 4Gb of memory, they too have become targets for mining malware. Researchers at Kaspersky ran the malware on a test phone to study it. Two days after initial infection, the phone was destroyed:Because of the constant load caused by the mining module and generated traffic, the battery bulged and deformed the phone cover.The researchers went on to state:Samples of the Loapi family are distributed via advertising campaigns. Malicious files are downloaded after the user is redirected to the attacker\u2019s malicious web resource. We found more than 20 such resources, whose domains refer to popular antivirus solutions and even a famous porn site.Further research by ad blocking firm AdGuard discovered that over 500 million people are inadvertently mining cryptocurrencies through their devices after visiting websites that run malware in the background.So if your smartphone is getting slow, it could just be Apple purposely grinding it down, or it may be something equally as insidious, such as mining malware. Be very careful what you are downloading and clicking online. Plus, it never hurts to run antivirus and anti-malware apps to scan and clean your device.Do you use anti-malware apps on your phone?

This can be seen in many industries, such as oil. When the price of oil goes up, people flock to gain employment in the industry. Businesses that provide services and goods to oil production see their bottom line expand as the amount of business they do shoots way up. We\u2019re now seeing this with Bitcoin. As Bitcoin has surged in value over 2017, the number of cryptocurrency jobs has boomed as well.The Jobs Market is Way UpIt seems that businesses and people have had Bitcoin on the brain for the last few months. There\u2019s good reason for this as the virtual currency has shot up remarkably in value. Not only is the price surge getting people into investing in crypto, major corporations, such as TD Ameritrade, are looking to get involved as well to grab a slice of that digital pie.Even though Bitcoin has dropped a bit from its all-time high (and has subsequently rebounded to a degree), the virtual currency has had a major impact in many lives. While some people may have gotten rich by getting in early, a lot of people are now getting jobs in the cryptocurrency field due to increased interest in Bitcoin and its digital brethren.Help Wanted: Cryptocurrency Experience a PlusOver the course of January through November of 2017, the number of job postings on LinkedIn with Bitcoin in the headline has boomed by 5,753% to a total of 4,917 listings. Overall, the number of jobs associated with Bitcoin and blockchain rose 306% on LinkedIn during the 12 month period that ended in mid-November.Of this increase in cryptocurrency jobs, a representative for Coinbase says:The rise in the value of Bitcoin and other digital currencies over the past 12 months has opened the market up to many retail and institutional investors who were previously sitting on the sidelines.As the size of the market has grown, Coinbase has added the right people to ensure our platform and customers are properly supported, and we have approximately doubled our headcount in the last year.It\u2019s a given that people will be getting jobs in the cryptocurrency field when Bitcoin climbs from just about $1000 at the beginning of the year to almost $20,000. As banks, investment firms, and other businesses look to expand into the crypto world, they\u2019re going to have to hire people who are knowledgeable about it. Not to mention the explosion of startups as different companies look to achieve a fat ICO by being the Next Big Thing.The launch of Bitcoin futures trading was met with extreme enthusiasm (and spending), causing the CBOE website to crash. Such success for futures trading means more jobs for those experienced with crypto. Major exchanges are hiring more people in order to keep up with demand. Coinbase increased their customer support from 24 people at the start of 2017 to just around 180. The exchange plans on upping that number to 400 by the first quarter of 2018.Prospects Look GoodOverall, the increasing market cap and value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is leading to a jobs boom for the field. Some naysayers may point out the volatility of the virtual currencies as a deterrent, but ZipRecruiter Cathy Barrera notes:In an industry as new as cryptocurrency. I would expect fluctuations in the pace of job opening growth and of growth in job applicant pool.Just think when automobiles first appeared on the scene. An entirely new industry sprang up as hundreds of individuals started their own car companies. While most of them failed over the long haul, the number of jobs in the auto industry rose sharply due to the successful companies expanding, along with the many businesses that rose to support the auto manufacturers, along with the industry as a whole. Cryptocurrency is a new economic sector that will continue to fuel the creation of more jobs.What do you think about the current boom in cryptocurrency jobs? How big can the entire field become?

Anatoly Aksakov, who is the chairman of the State Duma committee for the financial market, has said, through a rough translation, that cryptocurrencies will be known as \u201cother properties\u201d:There will be a final evaluation before the presentation of the bill. [Whether it is] Bitcoin or Ether, all cryptocurrencies [will be known as] other property.Limited ICO InvestingIt\u2019s not just digital currencies that will be getting the regulation treatment. The draft law also discusses ICOs. Aksakov added:The approach to how the ICO should be conducted is defined. I repeat, this is not the latest version, the latest version will be discussed in the coming days. The ICO is seen as an element of crowdfunding, and the approach is that investors should be limited in the amount they invest.Sergey Shvetsov, who is the First Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, had previously stated that his institution\u2019s goal of regulating ICOs will result in it becoming an alternative means of raising capital in the country.Even though the bill will be reviewed this week, implementation is still a couple of months away. According to Aksakov:I expect that the adoption of the draft law on cryptocurrencies will be in March.D-Day ApproachesRussian President Vladimir Putin has previously earmarked July 2018 as the deadline for the implementation of new and comprehensive crypto regulations in the countryAksakov has stressed that the draft law is actually in the interest of crypto holders:The problem is that we already have a lot of people who acquire[d] cryptocurrencies and they are deceived, we need to give people the opportunity to work legally with it, to protect them as much as possible.Even though Russia is aggressively pushing their regulation efforts, they are not immune to the charms of virtual currencies, previously announcing that they too will be part of the crypto revolution by launching their own digital currency, the CryptoRuble.What do you think of this latest development in Russia bid to regulate crypto?

In addition, its high level of anonymity has raised concerns that it could be used to finance terrorism, as well as to aid in money laundering schemes.These negative associations are exactly why the European Union (EU) has been working towards to implementing regulatory processes with regard to cryptocurrencies. This year\u2019s phenomenal increase in crypto prices and popularity might also have something to do with it though.The crypto industry reached a record-breaking $600 billion market cap, with Bitcoin being responsible for more than half of that. The most well-known digital currency has had an impressive year, peppered with drastic price surges and forays into mainstream adoption, thanks to futures contracts.A Comprehensive Database for Crypto UsersThe EU\u2019s proposal mean that crypto exchanges will have to follow strict rules with regard to reporting any suspicious activity and will also have to adhere to customer identity regulations.According to The Telegraph, the newest addition to the Fourth Anti Money Laundering directive states that the EU has the option of creating a \u201ccentral database registering users\u2019 identities and wallet addresses.\u201dThe updated amendment went on to state:The report shall be accompanied, if necessary, by appropriate proposals, including, where appropriate, with respect to virtual currencies, empowerments to set-up and maintain a central database registering users\u2019 identities and wallet addresses.This new proposal will have to wait until 2019 to be considered, the same time that the effectiveness of the new money laundering rules will be discussed. The information on these databases will be available to authorized institutions, such as the National Crime Agency and asset recovery authorities.No More Hiding Behind BitcoinThese databases will completely rip off the veil of secrecy that shrouds Bitcoin. This might be good news for regulators, but not for users. Even though their user information may be private, their transactions made with Bitcoin are not.In addition to exchanges, regulators also have their eye on ICOs for any related fraud or cybercrime. The IRS in America is also on the lookout for any sign of tax avoidance activity made possible with the help of digital currencies.The irony is that Bitcoin\u2019s huge increase in popularity may actually be acting as a deterrent to cyber criminals as the currency\u2019s network is under pressure, resulting in payment delays and high transaction fees.Exchanges Could Embrace These ChangesEven with its secretive nature, some experts surprisingly believe that exchanges will be on board with the new regulations. Jacek Czarnecki, a lawyer specializing in digital currencies at the Polish law firm, Wardynski & Partners, had this to say:The new regulatory framework might bring some civilization into the wild west of cryptocurrency and improve interconnections between the blockchain world and traditional financial systems, which have been rather shady so far.Whether these new policies will have any effect on the popularity, and price, of digital currencies remains to be seen, as does the belief that it will possibly encourage faster mainstream integration.What do you think about the recent increase in regulatory processes?

No red tape, no dealing with bank regulations, or dealing with bureaucratic nonsense. People tend to be able to accomplish far more on their own when left unfettered, and this is definitely seen when it comes to charity. Case in point is the recent crypto charity event for Covenant House Toronto that far exceeded expectations.Over $61,000 raised at #merrymerkle so far! Thanks to Robbie & Andreas for making tonight possible pic.twitter.com/NDdan6HkIX\u2014 Covenant House TO (@CovenantHouseTO) December 22, 2017Gather Around the Merkle TreeThe event in question is the Merry Merkle Tree event that was held on December 21st. More than 200 people attended the event, which was organized by Robbie Bent, the CEO of Truebit. Instead of a traditional Christmas tree, the event featured a Merkle tree that was connected to the blockchain.The goal was to raise $25,000 for Covenant House Toronto, a charity that feeds and shelters homeless youth. Of the idea for the tree and event, Bent says:We thought it was a funny pun. What if we had a Christmas Tree that lit up based on events happening on the ethereum blockchain? It\u2019s the first hardware Christmas tree that was connected to the blockchain.Word quickly spread beyond those at the event itself, and donations came pouring in, mostly in Ether. Overall, $3,000 was raised in cash, with the remainder of the initial $70,000 in Ethereum. Donations came from companies and individuals from all across the world.Tis the Season for GivingFor the event itself, a total of 86 Ether was raised. The charity hopes to raise an eventual total of $200,000, which would be enough to feed everyone at their shelter for an entire year. To date, the charity drive has raised 100.5 Ether. The charity drive is ongoing, and you can donate here. The cryptocurrency will be converted into fiat in early January.Needless to say, Bent is very happy with the amount of money raised and the response by the crypto community. He says:There\u2019s a real community here. You have 3,000 people who are super obsessed with this new technology and the way it\u2019s going to change the world, and I think those are the type of people who are really willing to give back.The surge in cryptocurrency prices is allowing a number of people to give heavily to charity. A couple who bought bitcoins back in 2013 are now donating all of their profits to the MUSC Hollings Cancer Center in South Carolina. The big daddy of crypto charity this year is Pine, the man behind the Pineapple Fund. He mined bitcoins when the cryptocurrency was still new, and the results have paid off. He realized that he had more money than he would ever need, so he created the fund to give away a whopping $86 million in Bitcoin to worthy charities.In the end, good things happen when people are unencumbered by regulations from governments and financial institutions. The Merry Merkle Tree event is just the latest example of people using cryptocurrency for something incredibly worthwhile. A lot of youths are going to have a safe place to sleep and something to eat due to the generosity of crypto enthusiasts.How much do you think the Merry Merkle Tree event will eventually raise?

The North Korean regime has spent the last couple of years targeting cryptocurrency in order to gain some much needed revenue, and you have to begrudgingly admire the lengths to which they\u2019ll go. Their latest attempts to get their grubby hands on some crypto features fake Facebook profiles of beautiful women.You Have a Friend RequestThe latest version of the North Korea cryptocurrency hacking attempts definitely takes a page from an old classic of using a pretty face. The South Korean intelligence agency reports that hackers from the communist regime are posing as beautiful women on Facebook and are contacting workers at digital currency exchanges.While in the guise of a woman, they strike up online conversations with their targets in order to eventually send them files that contain malicious code. The hackers are pretty patient in their subterfuge, as noted by the director of the Seoul cybersecurity firm EST Security, Moon Jong-Hyun. He notes that the hackers often pose as students in US colleges or workers at a research think tank. He also adds:They open Facebook accounts and maintain the online friendship for months before backstabbing the targets in the end.North Korea Getting Very Aggressive OnlineThere\u2019s no doubt that North Korea is stepping up their attacks in cyberspace. They used to focus their attempts on gaining political and military knowledge, but the ongoing sanctions has bled the country dry, so the focus now is on stealing as much currency as possible.Bitcoinist has covered the North Korean attacks on various Bitcoin exchanges in South Korea, as well as the recent fake job offers sent to cryptocurrency executives. As Simon Choi, the director of the Seoul cybersecurity firm Hauri, notes:The North\u2019s hacking operations are upgrading from attacks on \u2018enemy states\u2019 to a shady, lucrative moneymaking machine in the face of more sanctions.North Korean agents are also seemingly responsible for the WannaCry ransomware attacks that took control of computer systems in 150 countries back in May 2017. The Trump administration has confirmed, via an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, that North Korea was behind the attack. The op-ed states:It is based on evidence. We are not alone with our findings, either. Other governments and private companies agree. The United Kingdom attributes the attack to North Korea, and Microsoft traced the attack to cyber affiliates of the North Korean government.There\u2019s just no letup with North Korea trying to grab as much loot as they can through nefarious means. As for the fake Facebook profiles, there\u2019s no official word on how effective such attempts have been.However, the sheer patience and the use of the age-old technique of using the personae of a beautiful woman against a young, probably somewhat socially awkward man is often pretty effective. This just continues to show how far North Korea will go to steal cryptocurrency and that you should be careful who you friend on Facebook.What do you think about the latest North Korea cryptocurrency hacking attempt using fake Facebook profiles of gorgeous women?

Thai-backed BCPG will work with Power Ledger to make this happen.Renewable energy developers BCPG and Power Ledger have announced plans to introduce peer-to-peer renewable energy trading in Thailand. Solar energy will be at the heart of this undertaking, and it is set to revolutionize electricity production in the country and, hopefully, South East Asia.Leveraging Solar Energy to Meet Growing DemandsThailand is growing fast, and demand for electricity is growing with it. The P2P renewable energy grid is expected to supplement the already strained power plants currently supplying the country\u2019s electricity demands.The proposed plan will not only ease Thailand\u2019s electricity needs but also overcome a myriad of other problems. David Martin, Power Ledger\u2019s managing director noted that the proposed plan will reduce costs and carbon production and will be more resilient against severe weather conditions, unlike the current electricity production plants. BCPG and Power Ledger plan to begin implementing this plan in Bangkok, Thailand\u2019s biggest city. The two companies propose installing solar panels in 6-10 multi-story buildings ranging from housing units, schools, hospitals, and malls, among others. Proactive Environmentalism + ProfitabilityThe P2P renewable energy project will be profitable in two key aspects. First, it will ease the government\u2019s financial burden of building more power plants. Second, participants will be able to trade energy among themselves \u2013 Power Ledger\u2019s energy trading platform will enable participants to trade between 1MW and 2MWs of embedded solar energy. Additionally, the project will save the country a lot of money in losses incurred from the current electricity deficits and reduce individuals\u2019 cost of electricity. The Thai government will rely on Power Ledger\u2019s reputable energy trading platform to accomplish this. BCPG, on the other hand, has been tasked with selecting the ideal Thai bank that will provide autonomous financial settlement for these transactions.Utilizing Blockchain Technology to Transition from Centralized to Distributed Energy ModelBundit Sapianchai, the President of BCPG, notes that Thailand is ready to transition from a centralized to a distributed energy production model. Commenting on the proposed plan, Sapianchai stated:Innovation is at the heart of BCPG. And we are excited to be working with Power Ledger. [\u2026] This will help reduce the government\u2019s investment in building large-scale power plants to meet the growing demand for electricity and at the same time offer customers and consumers a greater choice of electricity from renewable energy in the form of Peer-to-Peer energy trading.For his part, Power Ledger\u2019s Martin commented:Renewable microgrid developments allow for the efficient installation and operation of generation capacity close to consumers, we\u2019re really proud to be working with BCPG to bring this technology to South East Asia Do you think Thailand\u2019s proposed P2P renewable energy project will materialize and meet its potential?

Nevertheless, CME exchanged Bitcoin future contracts for about $100 million USD.CME Bitcoin Futures Debut with New IndexesOne week after Cboe launched Bitcoin futures, CME, the largest futures exchange operator, followed suit. In effect, CME launched Bitcoin futures contracts, under the symbol BTC, on Sunday, December 17, 2017, for a trade dated December 18.The Bitcoin futures opening price for January delivery was $20,650 USD at 6 p.m. ET, on Sunday. According to observers, the CME Bitcoin futures debut was rather \u201ctepid.\u201d And, as The Wall Street Journal detailed:CME bitcoin futures for January expiration settled at $19,100 on Monday, down 2.1% from the level CME had deemed the opening price ahead of the contract\u2019s launch on Sunday evening. The January contract spiked as high as $20,650 initially, before falling to $18,345 within several hours of trading.The value of a single CME futures contract is five times the value of the Bitcoin Reference Rate Index, which is quoted in US dollars per one bitcoin.CME uses two Bitcoin pricing products, Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), and Bitcoin Real-Time Index (BRTI).The BRR is a daily reference rate of the US dollar value of one Bitcoin as of 4:00 PM GMT. The BRR aggregates Bitcoin trading activity across the main Bitcoin spot exchanges between 3:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. GMT.On the other hand, the BRTI is a real-time index of the US dollar of one bitcoin. The BRTI price is continuously published once per second. According to the CME, the BRTI provides real-time transparency to the US price of Bitcoin.As of this writing, the Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), and the Bitcoin Real-Time Index (BRTI) values are as follows:CME Bitcoin Futures Started with Light Volume but Significant ValueFor the first few hours, on the first day of trading, the volume of CME Bitcoin futures was lower than Cboe\u2019s, as Bloomberg explains:Trading volume for the CME futures has been light, with less than 650 contracts changing hands in the first eight hours of trading, compared with almost 2,500 over the same time frame during CBOE\u2019s debut.However, in the first eight hours, CME traded $61 million USD. That is about $12 million USD more than CBOE on the same time frame.Granted, nothing spectacular happened regarding price volatility and volume on the first day of CME futures trading. However, this event further solidified Bitcoin\u2019s status as a mainstream financial asset. Hence, it opened the door even wider for the many financial institutions that want to participate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Do you think Bitcoin futures trading volumes will soon increase?

A lot of governments and central banks are looking at ways to rein in and control cryptocurrency, and many such involved individuals can be quite dismissive of the ongoing expanse of virtual currencies. It seems that we can put Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso in that company as he recently said Bitcoin was not a credible currency.Not a Fan of BitcoinAso was asked about Bitcoin due to his French counterpart stating that he was going to propose ways to regulate the cryptocurrency during the G20 summit in Buenos Aires next year.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said:There is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how (\u2026) with all the other G20 members we can regulate bitcoin.To that proposal about Bitcoin, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso offered the following:There\u2019s no fixed definition on whether it\u2019s a currency or not. This issue is a difficult one. It has not yet been proven to be credible enough to become a currency, so I need to watch for a little while more.Bitcoin in JapanTaro Aso says that cryptocurrency hasn\u2019t made huge inroads into Japan, like it has in China, and that the Japanese people still prefer hard, fiat currency. However, such remarks may not be totally true.A lot of crypto exchanges and operations are making their way to Japan due to clampdowns in countries like China. It\u2019s estimated that Japanese retail investors account for 30% to 50% of all cryptocurrency trading. More exchanges are being given the green light in Japan, such as is the case with Chinese exchange Huobi, who is launching two cryptocurrency exchanges in conjunction with the SBI group.It looks like Bitcoin and its crypto brethren will be a major topic at the next G20 meeting. However, the meeting isn\u2019t until the end of November 2018, so who knows how big virtual currencies will have gotten at that point?

It\u2019s fair to say that right now, Bitcoin is under attack. The issues associated with scale, primarily transaction fees and confirmation times, have served up the perfect opportunity for other coins (and the people/teams that are behind them) to lay their respective claims as to why they solve above-outlined drawbacks.Perhaps unfortunately for Bitcoin, this has come just as it\u2019s broken through to mainstream consciousness and this \u2013 in turn \u2013 has amplified the platform from which those pushing alternative coins are pushing their message.No coin reflects this situation right now more than Bitcoin Cash.A Tale of Two BitcoinsThis week, Roger Ver, once a leading proponent of Bitcoin and famously one of the earlier investors in the space, appeared on CNBC\u2019s Fast Money to discuss the dramatic rise in price seen in the space over the last couple of weeks.Instead of justifying the price rise, however, Ver used the opportunity to push Bitcoin Cash and, at the same time, to express his opinions that Bitcoin is doomed to failure. By the end of the interview, two well-known CNBC pundits suggested that they felt Bitcoin Cash is a sounder investment than Bitcoin.Today, in an article published in The Sydney Morning Herald, a leading publication in Australia, Emil Oldenburg, CTO of Ver\u2019s Bitcoin.com, said \u201cbitcoin is right now the riskiest investment you can make\u201d and revealed that he has sold all of his bitcoins and switched to Bitcoin Cash.Forbes has also picked up on the story, quoting Oldenburg directly.Bitcoin and Media BiasThe issue here is that these outlets are respected and (supposedly) independent thought leaders and they are the outlets to which those just learning about Bitcoin and blockchain are turning for information. To lead with the comments of Bitcoin Cash proponents is misinformed and outright misleading.Which is why this piece, published today at the International Business Times, is a breath of fresh air. In the article, Alyse Kileen, a well-known name in the crypto space and a Managing Partner at StillMark Co. and StillMark Capital, outlined her belief that Bitcoin remains the strongest exposure to cryptocurrency right now and that cryptocurrency beginners should invest in bitcoin instead of Bitcoin Cash.In the article, Kileen writes:Bcash also addresses the issue of blockchain technology scaling, as many other new cryptocurrencies attempt to do\u2026 However, experts in digital currency have described very serious security vulnerabilities inherent in Bcash\u2019s method to scale; further, it may have the effect of centralizing control of the network.She concludes with the following:For cryptocurrency users and those new to the arena especially, the technical security inherent in the blockchain is critical, and security most robustly exists and has been historically demonstrated in Bitcoin.How all this plays out remains to be seen but one thing is certain \u2013 that more proponents of Bitcoin are going to need to get their opinions heard on mainstream media outside of just the owners of Bitcoin.com if mainstream public perception of Bitcoin is to be fair and well-informed.What do you think of bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash\u2019s representation in mainstream media?

This allows foreign citizens to become quasi-residents of Estonia, while benefiting from business and other opportunities remotely.If the scheme is successful, Estonia would be the first country ever to hold a state-sanctioned ICO, with officials expressing a desire to turn the country into an ICO \u201chaven.\u201d\u201cIn fact, a number of companies are in the process of launching ICOs in Estonia through e-Residency, while various others are planning theirs and are already exploring how to integrate the e-Residency card into their KYC procedure,\u201d e-Residency managing director Kaspar Korjus reports in a blog post Tuesday.European Central Bank Sounds AlarmThe exact nature of Estcoin is yet to be determined, with ease of purchase, tradeability and use cases all a topic of continuing debate.The scheme has already faced opposition since lawmakers first suggested it, notably from the ECB, which flatly said that Estcoin could not exist as an homegrown alternative to the euro.\u201cMuch of the criticism of estcoin was based on the fact that Estonia simply can\u2019t start its own cryptocurrency even if it wanted to. Estonia\u2019s only currency is the euro and this is an essential feature of our EU membership, which we are proud to have,\u201d Korjus continues. No one here is interested in changing that. That\u2019s why we have always referred to estcoin as a proposed \u2018crypto token.\u2019The situation is made more complex by the fact that Estonia\u2019s government has itself kept the country as what Korjus describes as \u201cnot\u2026 a particularly friendly jurisdiction towards crypto\u201d for \u201cunderstandably cautious reasons.\u201dNonetheless, despite setbacks to e-Residency which included unearthing of a vulnerability in IDs this year, the scheme is surging ahead, both in terms of business interest and usability.

To fix this issue, InsurePal is revolutionizing the many different facets of the insurance industry by using social proof to dramatically lower costs by removing irresponsible people from the insurance pool.As part of the effort by the first decentralized, blockchain-based social proof insurance platform to reward people who make responsible decisions, InsurePal announces that they are collaborating with Mattereum, the legal platform for making possible the legal transfer of property through the use of a smart contract.Boosting Business by Creating Transparency and TrustInsurePal brings responsible decision-making and social proof into the 21st century. It works by people taking responsibility by personally vouching for other individuals. If Bob vouches for Dave in regards to auto insurance, Dave gets a lower premium quote for his insurance and Bob receives a number of IPL tokens as a reward.The social proof comes into play that Bob is then on the hook for paying the deductible, and the refunding of the IPL tokens, if Dave is involved in an at-fault accident. If Dave makes good decisions and is not involved in an at-fault accident, then both parties keep their benefits at the year\u2019s end.One of the most striking features of InsurePal is how it boosts blockchain business transactions. The rise of cryptocurrency has helped fuel the boom in online business blockchain transactions, of which there are 350,000 every day. Yet an element of doubt always remains as both parties can wonder if they can fully trust the other.InsurePal brings in its patented social proof mechanism to create trust through transparency and shared responsibility. An insurance smart contract is created before the business transaction takes place. If one party does not fulfill their end of the deal, they, along with all of those individuals who have vouched for them, will be penalized to cover any losses. The level of engagement that an endorser has with a person will determine the penalty amount.Having blockchain business insurance will serve as a catalyst for a major growth of such transactions due to the self-regulating security and trust that defines the social proof mechanism. Further transparency is evident by the Social Proof Trustscore that each participating endorser has, whether they are directly or indirectly endorsing the contract\u2019s principals. This score is compiled from data collected from every transaction an individual is a part of. Thus, one can see how well one lives up to their agreements as well as those people whom they have endorsed.Mattereum and InsurePal Sign Letter of Intent to Collaborate on Effective Mass Use of #Blockchain https://t.co/vWFxRIygDo #ethereum #insurtech\u2014 InsurePal (@InsurePal_io) December 19, 2017Strategic AlliancesTo provide the best possible ecosystem for decentralized, blockchain-based insurance management, InsurePal has announced its upcoming collaboration with Mattereum. Working with Mattereum, InsurePal will be able to provide certainty about the legal frameworks that manage legal rights over property on the blockchain by means of a synthetic jurisdiction. Mattereum provides natural language contracts, along with corresponding smart contracts, to facilitate common legal tasks. With Mattereum, individuals can manage intellectual property as well as real-world assets, such as real estate or other physical properties.However, Mattereum goes a bit further than just creating a contract for use on the blockchain. Its natural language contracts specifically delegate legal authority to both the smart contract and to an arbitration association. The decisions made by arbitration have full legal weight behind them and are legally binding. As such, Mattereum adds a vital component to the ecosystem of InsurePal, which is now composed of insurance, blockchain ID, and arbitration. This added layer of arbitration and property management dovetails perfectly with InsurePal\u2019s blockchain business transaction insurance.A Winning ConceptProponents of decentralized, blockchain technology recognize a winning concept when they see it. This was evident recently when InsurePal won 1st place in the ICO pitch contest at the d10e conferences in both Ljubljana, Slovenia and Bukarest, Romania. The d10e conferences focus on everything that decentralization brings to the modern world, such as the blockchain, Fintech, ICOs, cryptocurrency, and more. Out of a very talented field, InsurePal was singled out to take first place due to the strength of their unique concept.The future of the blockchain is identity without authority, and digital trading will continue to expand along with the use of cryptocurrency. People are already using digital currencies to buy and sell assets, but there\u2019s always a level of doubt involved. InsurePal is providing the trust and transparency that people are looking for through the self-regulating social proof mechanism.Blockchain business transactions will benefit from the insurance offered by InsurePal, causing the field to grow exponentially. InsurePal is making important strategic partnerships, such as with Mattereum, to provide the three basic pillars of future blockchain business: blockchain ID, arbitration, and insurance. Security, trust, and tangible benefits for all parties will make InsurePal a vital component of blockchain business transactions.You can learn more about InsurePal\u2019s proof of concept to see how the decentralized platform will boost confidence in blockchain business transactions by visiting their official crowdsale website. You can also follow them on Twitter and Facebook, read their whitepaper and lightpaper, and talk to the development team on Telegram.What do you think of InsurePal\u2019s concept?

They are the first US Olympic team to accept Bitcoin donations.The 2018 Winter Olympics is almost here. Beginning on February 9th, 2018, hopeful athletes from all over the world will descend upon PyeongChang, South Korea, dreaming of Olympic glory. One such group of athletes is the USA Luge team, who are already making history, but not in the way you think. The Luge team is the first US Olympic team to accept Bitcoin as a donation.Going for the Gold with a Little Help from BitcoinThe 2018 USA Luge team is composed of ten individuals: seven men and three women. Historically, luge has not been one of the more popular Olympic sports for American viewers. That crown currently belongs to figure skating, with hockey a distant second.This means that the USA Luge team is often in need of funds. While the team does have some sponsors, every little bit counts quite a bit. Which is why the team is turning to Bitcoin for help.Gordy Sheer, the USA Luge marketing director and silver medalist in the 1998 Olympic doubles, sees some parallels between crypto users and lugers. He says:You know, we hear a lot of jokes about lugers being crazy, and people don\u2019t know why we do it. But luge is something that gets into your blood and transforms your life\u2026and the bitcoiners we\u2019ve met know exactly what it\u2019s like to be all in on something that the world doesn\u2019t appreciate yet. We\u2019ve looked at bitcoin hard, and it is definitely a risk-reward we understand and are eager to take.Bitcoin Donations Have Tax BenefitsCryptocurrency has been used to help fund an Olympic team in the past. The most notable example is the Jamaican bobsled team in 2014 who received some Dogecoin. However, this is an official act by the USA Luge team, who are thinking long-term investment for future funding by accepting Bitcoin now.Ty Danco, a former member of the USA Luge team and current worker on Wall Street, was one of the first to donate some bitcoins. Danco says:It\u2019s such a natural and good fit for the team. The luge team is not thinking short term, but long. By hodling bitcoin with the express goal of holding on through the 2022 and 2026 Olympic Games, the sport hopes to change from being underfunded to being able to support full teams on the World Cup level at the same time as developing grassroots youth programs to develop athletes. Bitcoin is still in its early days, and hats off to USA Luge for being both brave and prescient to ride this wave.There are some current tax benefits for donating Bitcoin to Team USA. Donors will not have to pay the taxes on any appreciation gained, which will help keep the IRS off their backs. Also, donations made this year will fall under the current tax code. Overall, it\u2019s great for a financially-strapped team to look to independent donation sources, and cryptocurrency is just the thing.Will Bitcoin help lead the USA Luge team to Olympic glory? Will other Olympic teams turn to cryptocurrency for fundraising?

However, instead of the awe of Bitcoin soaring ever higher in value, there is shock as the cryptocurrency has plunged dramatically over the last week. One of the biggest bulls for Bitcoin over the last year is Michael Novogratz, and he now says that Bitcoin could drop as low as $8,000.Putting Plans on HoldWhile many analysts have minimized Bitcoin and how far it could go, Michael Novogratz was one of the few who always remained very optimistic about the virtual currency. When Bitcoin was trading for around $8,000, he was adamant that it would reach $10,000 by the end of the year. (He was more than right about that.) When the coin hit $10,000 just before December, he said that it would \u201ceasily\u201d reach $40,000 over the next few months.However, Bitcoin\u2019s recent slump has put a dampener on all things crypto. Novogratz had planned on launching Galaxy Digital Assets, a cryptocurrency hedge fund, on December 15th with a whopping $500 million, but he notified potential investors on December 13th that he was delaying it.In an interview with CNBC, Novogratz said:We were supposed to launch on December 15th and we paused. I didn\u2019t like the market conditions as a starting point to take other investors\u2019 money.As Bitcoin continued to plunge in value, he added:I look pretty smart pressing the pause button now.To be clear, we delayed launching a hedge fund with outside investors capital last week because we didn\u2019t like market conditions for new investors. In no way does it mean we are less bullish the crypto markets.\u2014 Michael Novogratz (@novogratz) December 22, 2017Down on Crypto?Novogratz cited several reasons for delaying the fund, such as the prospect of buying Ether or Bitcoin for his clients while also selling crypto investments in his personal account at the same time. He went on to say that Bitcoin could drop as low as $8,000 and that it will be at least a few months before the coin approaches $20,000 again. Put succinctly, he said:When you get kicked this hard, it takes a lot of ice to get the swelling down.Yet, the price drop in Bitcoin and its virtual brethren hasn\u2019t dampened his enthusiasm for crypto. He says that he\u2019s still \u201cvery bullish\u201d on the subject and is still working on building a full merchant bank for crypto.The delay in launching Galaxy Digital Assets is a setback for Michael Novogratz. His previous fund was liquidated back in 2015 after suffering losses. However, you shouldn\u2019t feel too bad for him. He began buying Bitcoin and Ether back in 2015 and cashed out this year, making a $250 million profit.Do you think Bitcoin will drop to $8,000? How long will it take for the cryptocurrency to once again threaten $20,000?

Ransomware attacks have targeted everything from major corporations down to a local transit authority, and they\u2019re increasing in frequency. Some of the insurance companies who have to deal with the fallout of such attacks are making a ransomware Bitcoin connection, saying that the rising number of such attacks is the cryptocurrency\u2019s fault.Blaming BitcoinIn an interview with Bloomberg, three insurance companies laid the blame for an increase in ransomware claims upon Bitcoin\u2019s shoulders. One such company is Zurich-based Chubb, and one of their executive vice presidents, Michael Tanenbaum, said that it\u2019s the increased value of the cryptocurrency that is driving hackers to strike more often.Tanenbaum says 2017 has seen a \u201cmassive escalation\u201d in both the number of ransomware attacks and the amount of payments made in bitcoins. As insurance companies are on the hook (as long as the company has such a policy), they keep a keen eye on how much such hacking costs them.How big are the payouts becoming for insurance companies? The largest claim before 2017 was $17,000. That amount is pocket change as Tanenbaum says that, around midyear, the top payouts for ransomware attacks on corporations went over $1 million. That\u2019s quite a jump.Hackers Becoming More EmboldenedTwo other ransomware specialists, Kivu Consulting and Navigant Consulting, agree with Chubb over Bitcoin and the increasing ransomware attacks. They note that the frenzy surrounding the increasing value of Bitcoin has emboldened hackers. Winston Krone of Kivu Consulting notes that ransom demands from $250,000 to $500,000 are now a weekly occurrence but were totally nonexistent six months ago.An executive at Beazley Plc, Kimberly Horn, says that ransomware claims at the company are up a staggering 70% this year. She adds:Because the price of bitcoin has seen a dramatic spike in the latter half of 2017, it has made the overall price of demands much larger.It may be true that there is a ransomware Bitcoin correlation. Criminals love the anonymity of cryptocurrency, but just because bitcoins are worth more doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that more attacks are going to be made. If a hacker wanted a higher payout for their crime, they could always ask for a higher ransom. However, the instantaneous and anonymous nature of using Bitcoin can be a component of the increased attacks. Having to deal with wire transfers and other means of ransom payments could get complicated. Having a sum of virtual currency sent to a wallet address is so much easier.Then there\u2019s the fact that success breeds imitation. Companies were quite willing to pay ransomware demands, especially if the demands were not too high, as it was cheaper than fighting back. Acquiescing to criminals always ensures that more criminals will line up to rob you.Another factor in increased attacks and payment demands is ease.

The Japanese government officially recognized and legalized Bitcoin as a payment method, and this decision surprised many cryptocurrency users. Later in the year, Chinese regulators suspended several cryptocurrency sites and exchanges amid plans to introduce official regulations. This caused a massive exodus of Chinese cryptocurrency traders, and many decided to use exchanges based in Japan and South Korea in order to bypass this ban.Recent news emerged that the government of Belarus officially legalized cryptocurrencies and gave them tax-exempt status for the next 5 years. Belarus is aiming to attract more fintech and cryptocurrency startups/companies into opening operations in its country and thus become an international cryptocurrency hub.Is It Time for a Fiat-Based Digital Currency?Many analysts have speculated that governments and financial institutions will launch their own fiat-based cryptocurrencies in order to compete with decentralized ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Many central banks have already started testing their own digital currencies. The most famous example is the prototype digital currency that the People\u2019s Bank of China has been quietly testing. A report by TechCrunch stated that the Russian government is also exploring the possibility of creating its own state-issued cryptocurrency called CryptoRuble.Many governments around the world are currently experimenting with digital currencies and their possibilities. The DailyMail reported that the Eurozone, however, has no plans to introduce its own fiat-based digital currency. Specifically, Bundesbank board member Carl-Ludwig Thiele does not see a possibility for the Eurozone to introduce its own cryptocurrency in the near future. He further stated:Digital central bank money analogous to cash is currently not in sight.He also added:We are seeing a rapid increase in value, which brings the risk of rapid losses,The main reason behind this is the fact that fiat-based cryptocurrencies might bring unpredictable issues like scaling, security, and costs. Besides, many experts believe that the astronomical rise of Bitcoin may concern central banks from adopting their own digital currencies.What are your thoughts on a Eurozone-based digital currency?

It is a novel idea to package Bitcoin as a gift token, making a potentially perfect little stocking filler this Christmas for anyone even remotely interested in cryptocurrency or serving as an introduction for those too time-constrained to research further.Kemball-Cook explains:This is for people on the fence who don\u2019t have the time and understanding to buy.The idea of gifting Bitcoin itself is not new, however. People have been sending Bitcoin tips online or buying paper wallets for their families for years and there are a few other gifting services, like GiveCoinGifts.com, that sell bitcoin gift cards as well.Celebrating 2017 \u2013 The Year Bitcoin Grew Up2017 has certainly been Bitcoin\u2019s year if price and trending web searches are anything to go by, so it makes sense that Bitcoin is high enough in the public consciousness to warrant the gifting service.Give the gift everyone is talking about this Christmas > a @Bitcoin with our new vouchers! https://t.co/HFhwaqYDZg #bitcoin #xmaspresents pic.twitter.com/ap7L5ZLzYN\u2014 Give Coin Gifts (@givecoingifts) December 18, 2017The couple will buy the coins for a premium, keeping them for customers until they either choose to cash out or transfer their Bitcoin from the gift vouchers.Speaking about the service, Kemball-Cook says:We\u2019ve both built companies before.

As a result, Cboe is now trying to expand its participation in the cryptocurrency business. In effect, Cboe has just petitioned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch six Bitcoin-based exchanged traded funds (ETFs).The Push for ETFs Heats upSEC\u2019s authorization to trade Bitcoin futures contracts elevated the cryptocurrency into the circle of mainstream finance, setting the stage for the launching of Bitcoin ETFs. In fact, even a couple of days before the rollout of Bitcoin futures, three fund managers had each requested SEC approval for Bitcoin ETFs: First Trust Advisors LP, Van Eck Associates Corp., and REX Shares LLC.Most recently, CNBC reports, Cboe Global Markets requested the SEC\u2019s approval to list the following Bitcoin-related ETFs:First Trust Bitcoin Plus Strategy ETF First Trust Inverse Bitcoin Strategy ETF REX Bitcoin Strategy ETF REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF GraniteShares Bitcoin ETF GraniteShares Short Bitcoin ETFMoreover, according to an ETF Trends report, NYSE Arca, Inc. also submitted a petition, dated December 19, to list and trade shares of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF and the ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF. NYSE Arca is a U.S. electronic security exchange that trades both stocks and options.CBOE Succeeds with Its First Week of Trading Bitcoin FuturesCBOE started trading Bitcoin futures contracts (XBT) only ten days ago, as of this writing. On the closing of the first day of trading, in spite of website congestion due to heavy traffic, CBOE posted a volume of over 4,000 contracts. Since then, the daily volume of Bitcoin futures traded has been increasing, as shown in the graph below:These results have encouraged CBOE executives to double down on the cryptocurrency by wanting to launch Bitcoin-related ETFs. In this regard, CNBC reports that a CBOE spokesperson said:Given the success of the launch of our bitcoin futures, several partners are very interested in moving forward with the development of an exchange-traded product.At present, the cryptocurrency is rapidly recovering from one of its worse plunges. Bitcoin dipped to about $11,000 USD, at 11:00 ET, on December 22. However, in less than 12 hours, Bitcoin had risen above $16,00, displaying once again its spectacular resiliency.Financial experts increasingly understand that volatility is an inherent feature of the cryptocurrency. For example, according to CNBC, Tony Lee, Co-founder of Fundstrat, increased mid-2018 Bitcoin\u2019s price target to $20,000 USD, from $11,000 USD. He made this decision on December 22, a day of high volatility.If the SEC authorizes any Bitcoin ETFs, many believe that interest from retail as well as institutional investors and their billions of dollars could drive Bitcoin\u2019s value to incredible highs.What do you think about the potential impact of the SEC approval of Cboe\u2019s Bitcoin-related ETFs?

Well, ING, which is a Dutch multinational financial services group, doesn\u2019t seem to think so.No Option for AdoptionAccording to RT, Teunis Brosens, Principal Economist at ING Amsterdam, detailed his thoughts on the matter in his Economic & Financial Analysis report:What they regard as key benefits, may actually be impediments to wider adoption. Users will include tech nerds, people obsessed about their privacy, people afraid of (hyper) inflation in traditional currencies, and people wanting to circumvent central banks for ideological or criminal reasons.In addition, Brosens does not consider Bitcoin to be \u201ca normal investment asset\u201d. This is because the decentralized currency does not have \u201cthe full faith and credit\u201d of centralized institutions such as governments and central banks to back it up. He went on to add:Bitcoin proponents argue that volatility will fall as Bitcoin adoption increases. That may be the case. Yet bitcoin remains money with fixed supply, lacking a central bank to manage price stability.Bitcoin\u2019s Volatility Is Back in the SpotlightThe digital currency\u2019s characteristic unpredictability was on full display this week as it went from record-breaking heights of nearly $20k to trading at an average of just over $13k. The report details Bitcoin\u2019s drastic price surges and phenomenal growth for this year.Bosens\u2019 critique of the crypto didn\u2019t end there though. He also said:Bitcoin\u2019s high-value today is based on shaky foundations. The only justification for investing in bitcoin today is the assumption that others are willing to buy Bitcoin at higher prices in the future.He views Bitcoin investors as people who are unaware of the true vision and goal of cryptocurrencies, and these investors \u201cdon\u2019t care much either\u201d.'#Bitcoin only good for tech nerds, privacy nuts & criminals' \u2013 Dutch multinational bank #ING https://t.co/dyKGIZieIm pic.twitter.com/5l8PZD6bdR\u2014 RT (@RT_com) December 23, 2017His narrative continued:A niche asset adopted worldwide could still have a substantial user base and hence value. It is therefore impossible to say whether the current Bitcoin market price is \u201ctoo high\u201d for a niche asset.Bosens concluded:Then again, we join the crowd of analysts observing typical bubble characteristics: the idea of an asset that is new, revolutionary, almost magic, hard to understand, but let\u2019s invest anyway because it will become huge. This idea is a form of \u2018this time is different\u2019 thinking. \u2018Yes, we know about all those precious bubbles that popped, but Bitcoin is really, really different.\u2019 We are not so sure.Even though the Amsterdam-based institution may not be alone in their thinking, evidence to the contrary can be seen in new developments in Belarus yesterday. The country will be legalizing both digital currencies and ICOs, and any revenue made from crypto- and blockchain-based endeavors will be tax exempt for five years.Do you think that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will eventually be globally adopted?

Analysts believe that mobile and consoles games are one of the most important sectors of the total gaming industry.ICOs for Game DevelopersAs the gaming industry is experiencing massive growth, the global competition for market share has also rapidly increased. Many successful online video games started as small crowdfunding projects on popular sites like Indiegogo and Kickstarter. But nowadays the increased competition has made it very difficult for new game projects to hit their crowdfunding goal.Game Machine is a new project that is aiming to offer a new solution for this problem.

However, anyone that has dealt with BTC will also know that it is inefficient, slow, and expensive to send and receive.Transaction costs are escalating, it can take hours to send it from one exchange to another, and crypto exchanges often just close their digital doors when demand is overwhelming. Not a great start for revolutionary technology that will change the world. What Bitcoin has done, though, is transform the blockchain industry into a massive horse race of alternative digital currencies, who are all vying to be the next big thing.Verging On RidiculousTechnology evolves, and while Bitcoin is still a basic and sluggish system, it needs to be scaled up by huge proportions to meet demand if it is ever going to flourish as a digital currency. Many predict it will not succeed but be surpassed by something far more superior. Enter Verge, a little known altcoin that has done big things in recent months. According to a Yahoo News report, XVG has been running rings around BTC this year.Verge can be considered as Bitcoin 2.0 in that it has adapted the blockchain to improve security and anonymity in addition to capacity and transaction times. Anonymity is something that is lacking on Bitcoin\u2019s public ledger. Verge has solved this by incorporating the use of multiple anonymity-centric networks, such as Tor and I2P. Internet (IP) addresses of users are obfuscated, and the transactions are completely untraceable, according to the spiel on their website.If Bitcoin transactions are slower than a proverbial tractor, transactions on Verge happen at light speed, comparatively speaking. Its use of Simple Payment Verification technology allows most transactions processed through Verge\u2019s blockchain to be completed in around five seconds. Verge also maintains a community feel since it\u2019s not a private company. Community members are responsible for the direction of its technology and where the coin heads next. It currently offers a number of secure mobile wallets, including the Tor Android Wallet, which offers mobile anonymity, another big plus over Bitcoin.The Verge SurgeVerge could be a game changer for digital currencies. It has made an astronomical rise this year from $0.00002 in January to an all-time high a couple hours ago of $0.30, according to CoinMarketCap. That is a staggering 1.5 million percent, which pretty much blows Bitcoin out of the water. At the time of writing, XVG has a market cap of $3.5 billion, with a total of 16.5 billion tokens and 14.5 billion in circulation. It could go literally to the moon if mass adoption follows. The majority of XVG is traded on Binance and Bittrex, where over a billion dollars in volume has been recorded in the past 24 hours. Things change fast in crypto land, and it is time for Bitcoin to move over.[Full disclosure: The author of this article is a Verge (XVG) holder]Is it time for Bitcoin to get off its perch and be replaced with something far more efficient?

The price to be paid for the success of cryptocurrencies is the tsunami of crime and malevolent activity that will follow.In many cases, the crime wave has already begun. According to reports earlier this month, the SEC announced that it had shut down the Plexcoin ICO for allegedly defrauding investors of $15 million. There is a well-documented inherent risk with investing in cryptocurrencies on unregulated exchanges and wallets. However, hacking will post the greatest threat going forward.Hacking ThreatsAccording to the US Department of Homeland Security, a third of all Bitcoin exchanges were hacked between 2009 and 2015, and an escalating number of one-off scams and attacks on individual investors have been occurring during the same period. Crypto heists are extremely lucrative at the moment, with prices reaching all-time highs just a week ago. This will incentivize hacking collectives to expand beyond their regular activities, which include ransomware, personal identity theft, and banking Trojans.Unlike regular banks that are insured, there is no such safety net with cryptocurrencies, and there are more methods of exploitation open to hackers and cyber criminals. Investors that lose to theft, fraud, or exchange account freezes will not get reimbursed.Crypto Crime WaveIf the past is anything to go by, the digital incursions have already started in earnest. Hackers have already targeted cryptocurrency exchanges, digital wallets, ICOs, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, mining companies, virtual private servers, and hosting services.Just this month, Bitcoin mining company NiceHash was hacked, leading to more than $60 million in losses for its customers. Last month was the Tether hack, which resulted in losses of over $30 million, and the list doesn\u2019t stop there. Last year, the world\u2019s largest exchange, Bitfinex, was hacked of 120,000 bitcoins that were worth an estimated $75 million at the time they were stolen.The infamous DAO hack of June 2016 resulted in the loss of 3.6 million Ether, which went straight into the attacker\u2019s Child DAO account. Developers were forced to soft fork the platform to prevent further losses. Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after $800 million in Bitcoin was stolen, and the list goes on.In addition to hacking, there have been DDOS attacks, ICO scams, and phishing attacks on individual investors. Research firm Chainalysis estimates that as much as $225 million has been stolen from cryptocurrency investors this year alone. Next year will not be an improvement for cybercrime in the crypto industry.Are you worried about the crypto crime wave?

Though they initially stuck their hands in the sand and ignored the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin\u2019s amazing surge over 2017 has forced them to take notice. On the whole, bankers are not fans of Bitcoin as it represents an existential threat, and this is borne out by the many shots they\u2019re willing to dish out. The latest salvo comes from Belgium Central Bank governor Jan Smets, who declares that Bitcoin is not a threat because it\u2019s unstable.Not a Fan of BitcoinIn a recent interview, Smets makes some pointed remarks about Bitcoin. He first says that the virtual currency is not stable like the euro, and he follows that by saying that blockchain-based digital currency could diminish banks\u2019 limitation to drop interest rates below zero.Jan Smets went on to say:Let\u2019s stop calling bitcoin a currency. Unlike the euro, bitcoin is not guaranteed by a central bank or government as a means of payment so bitcoin is not a currency. Even if there are small risks for investing in bitcoin at the moment, there are potential consequences for financial stability.The bank governor was pretty keen on the notion that Bitcoin could not be trusted and used like a currency because there\u2019s no central authority overseeing the network. He went on to say that most of the people investing in Bitcoin are only doing so because they\u2019re speculating on the virtual currency going up in value. On a positive note, he does say the risk of investing in Bitcoin is pretty low at the moment, but this could change pretty rapidly.Likes Bank-Issued CryptoIt should be noted that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appeal to many people because there\u2019s no central authority behind them. Crypto networks run on a trustless, decentralized, and peer-to-peer system. The whole point of crypto is that you don\u2019t need to rely upon banks or central governments in order to send or receive money.On his people investing in Bitcoin comment, I think he may both be right and wrong. A great many people use bitcoins as an everyday part of their life, whether for buying things or getting paid. It\u2019s a tremendous way to pay people who have done work for you but live on a different continent. All the red tape and other barriers banks and governments have put up over the years is completely circumvented when using crypto. However, there are a good number of people who are buying the cryptocurrency in hopes of it gaining in value. Such speculation can have an impact upon price.Of course, Smets is a fan of digital currency if it\u2019s issued and backed by a bank or government. He sees promise in what the blockchain can deliver for the payment system in terms of innovation and efficiency, and he hopes to see a digital euro one day. The governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Philip Lowe, is also in favor of bank-issued crypto as well.It should be noted that Jan Smets is not alone in his views on Bitcoin. Other bank governors are also part of the chorus. Governors from the central banks of Australia, Canada, Denmark, and New Zealand have all denigrated Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Such an attitude is not surprising as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are cutting out institutions such as banks from the daily economic interactions between sovereign citizens.Do you agree with Jan Smets in that Bitcoin is too unstable to be a threat? Do you think banks will begin issuing their own cryptocurrency?

Not only do people have to contend with criminals hacking exchanges and emptying wallets, there are lots of shady characters pushing ICOs and other get-rich-quick schemes. One of the most outright brazen fraudsters is Sergei Mavrodi, the man behind the MMM pyramid scheme in Russia, and he\u2019s back to relaunch his Mavro token.Sounds Too Good to Be True? It Probably IsFirst, a little background on Sergei Mavrodi. He created the MMM (Mavrodi Mundial Moneybox ) pyramid scheme back in 1989 but gained parliamentary immunity by being elected to the office of deputy of the State Duma. About 15 million people bought into his hype of being able to earn 300% returns per month.Needless to say, all of those people lost their savings, and media reports say that at least 50 people who had invested their money into the scheme committed suicide. Sergei Mavrodi then declared MMM to be bankrupt in 1997 and went on the run until he was caught in 2003. In 2007, a Russian court ordered him to a prison sentence of four and a half years.The Pyramid is BackSince his release, Mavrodi has launched additional pyramid schemes, such as MMM-2011, in various countries: China, India, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. Naturally, he extols amazing returns.He started his MMM Global project in 2014, and at the heart of his pyramid scheme is the Mavro crypto. This crypto is given out to those who voluntarily give to others, and the amount of crypto a person has supposedly increases the more active they are. He had previously launched the crypto in the past, but he is launching a new version under the MMM Mavro label in five days time. The website for the crypto states that \u201cThe time for change is now! We can do a lot!! Financial Apocalypse is inevitable!!!\u201dWhat is insane is that people continue to fall for scams like this. What\u2019s almost funny is that he was able to operate in Russia after his release as ponzi and pyramid schemes are not illegal.

The aim with this initiative is to reduce the country\u2019s cash transactions, which are often viewed as being used for increased tax evasion and money laundering.The Ministry of Finance is looking to include a clause in a piece of legislation due for approval in January that would help create the legal framework for a Israeli cryptocurrency. The clause will detail the proposal and give the Ministry the ability to start testing how this new currency would work and be distributed.State-Sponsored Crypto Is All the RageIsrael joins the growing list of countries that are adopting crypto and other blockchain technologies. Earlier this year, Bitcoin was declared legal tender in Japan, allowing businesses to accept the controversial currency just as it would accept fiat currencies. Japanese and South Korean banks are also testing how cryptocurrencies can be implemented to streamline cross-border payments between the two countries.Japan is also set to launch their own currency in the coming year. With the support of many financial and regulatory bodies, they plan to launch their currency with the proposed name \u201cJ-coin\u201d before the 2020 Olympic games in Tokyo. Sweden is also following the crypto-path, looking to launch an e-kronor in the future. They cite the fact that there is decreased cash usage in the Norwegian nation and that the country\u2019s banks and businesses prefer non-cash payments. In fact, 900 of Sweden\u2019s 1,600 banks no longer hold cash reserves or accept cash deposits.Blockchain technology, which is essentially a public account that anyone can access to verify transactions, has huge implications for anyone trying stop financial fraud. It makes sense for governments to embrace the new technology, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see how it will work at that level.What do you think about state-sponsored cryptocurrencies?

Within just a couple of days, the digital asset\u2019s price swung by $8,000 from just over $20k down to $12k and back up again to around $13.5k where it currently trades.The naysayers will be gloating while the investors will be looking at it as a simple market correction which offers another buying opportunity before it surges again after the holiday period. Industry analysts at Russia Today have followed the trends and have lent their knowledge and opinion to the big Bitcoin debate.State Coins ComingDoctor Jack Rasmus, professor of Political Economy at St. Mary\u2019s College in California had this to say;It\u2019s not going to be the currency of the future because the central banks will start issuing their own digital currencies before it threatens the money supply. But it is definitely a speculative commodity bubble. Bitcoins and other cryptos are a commodity play, much like gold, in fact, they\u2019re sucking a lot of money, capital investment out of the gold market, and it\u2019s a speculative play, and I think it\u2019s going to go higher. But it is a speculative bubble, and the key question is will it pose some sort of danger to the financial asset markets in general.Meanwhile, Max Keiser, host of RT\u2019s Keiser Report said this on the topic;What is driving the action at bitcoin is people who are looking to store value and escape the US dollar, which is a tulip bulb of our era. The stock market and bond market are the tulip bulbs of our era. The tulip bulb of 1630 was driven by highly leveraged transactions that are what gave us tulip bulb mania of 1630. Bitcoin is the opposite of that.Asian AppetiteDr Rasmus went on to acknowledge that it was investors in Asia who where the main impetus behind the drive:Margin and retail buyers in Japan are driving this market. It is not the tech nerds in the US. And whenever you get extreme margin buying, you are going to get a lot of volatility. And it is going to collapse. Most of this trade is located in Japan, and the Japanese financial authority has legitimized this.Ministers in Germany and France have called for a G20 summit on cryptocurrencies to decide on regulation but according to Keiser they are likely to fail;There\u2019s no way to stop bitcoin. It\u2019s unstoppable. There\u2019s nothing they can do to stop the adoption, growth, acceptance of bitcoin as a store of value, as a currency and as a unit of account.

Zip. Nada.The report, titled Bitcoin Decrypted, discussed the difficulty in ascribing value to the digital currency, noting that it behaves like neither a currency nor a store-of-value commodity like gold, silver, etc\u2026 Examining several key factors, Faucette points out:Bitcoin can\u2019t be valued as a currency because it has no associated interest rate;It may be likened to digital gold but, unlike gold itself, which is used in electronics, jewelry, etc.., Bitcoin has no inherent use*;While it is technically a payment network, Bitcoin is difficult to scale and charges no transaction fee*;Bitcoin\u2019s average daily trade volume over the last 30 days is only $3 billion* compared to $5.4 trillion in the FX market;The estimated daily purchase volume for Bitcoin is less than $300 million compared to Visa\u2019s $17 billionAll of these facts, according to Faucette, underscore the fact that the digital currency has \u201cvirtually no acceptance, and shrinking.\u201d In fact, he provides a handy chart (above) to illustrate his statement. Because of this, he maintains that \u201cIf nobody accepts the technology for payment then the value would be 0.\u201dHold On There, Speed\u2026I hate to burst your bubble, Mr. Faucette, but some of your facts are\u2026shall we say\u2026less than factual. Mind you, I am no financial analyst, but then you don\u2019t need to be to pick out these errors.FACT 1 \u2013 Bitcoin has no inherent useThis one is a little tricky to refute, but I\u2019ll give it a go. Playing devil\u2019s advocate, let\u2019s say that Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency has no inherent use. It\u2019s underlying architecture, the blockchain, has a wide range of applications. I know\u2026\u201dBut blockchain and Bitcoin are two separate things\u2026\u201d True, but without the blockchain, we wouldn\u2019t have Bitcoin to begin with, so one could conceivably argue that \u2013 in this instance \u2013 they are two sides of the same coin.Bitcoin has other uses too \u2013 especially in a socioeconomic sense. Consider the current economic conditions in Venezuela and Zimbabwe. These people have been utterly failed by their respective governments. Inflation is through the roof, their native currency has about as much value as one-ply toilet paper, and people \u2013 families \u2013 are starving. So where are they turning? Bitcoin. People are mining bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies so that they can survive. That\u2019s pretty useful if you ask me.FACT 2 \u2013 Bitcoin charges no transaction feeUm\u2026hello? There is absolutely a transaction fee, and right now, we\u2019re paying it out the wazoo. It\u2019s part of those \u201cscalability issues\u201d you mention in your research report. Now, if by transaction fee, you mean a centralized service provider collecting a fee that goes into its own coffers, then I guess maybe you\u2019re technically correct, but you\u2019ve still missed the point. Kind of like tech support at a software company whose name will not be mentioned here.FACT 3 \u2013 Bitcoin\u2019s average trade volume over the last 30 days is only $3 billionWhat rock have you been living under? Go look at the historical data for the last 30 days on CoinMarketCap. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll wait. Second column from the right. The one labeled Volume. If you take the average of all 30 days, as of this writing, it works out to $11.8 billion \u2013 just a wee bit more than your $3 billion estimate.I respect your experience and your financial acumen, Mr. Faucette, and it even looks like we both believe in the same old adage, \u201cForewarned is forearmed,\u201d but if you\u2019re arming your clients with inaccurate information, what purpose does it serve?What do you think of Faucette\u2019s claims?

They spent years rowing in order to become Olympic athletes in the sport, which they did in 2008. After they were screwed by Mark Zuckerberg, they went to the mat and sued him, gaining $65 million in a settlement.They then used $11 million of that settlement to buy bitcoins, back when they cost less than $10 each. Most people laughed at them, but they were willing to go the long distance for the virtual currency. That wait has certainly paid off as Bitcoin has soared in value over the course of 2017. While it has dipped once again, the value of the bitcoins held by the twins is still well over a billion dollars.A great retort to all the naysayers who mocked the twins over their initial Bitcoin purchase, Tyler Winklevoss says:We\u2019ve turned that laughter and ridicule into oxygen and wind at our back.Keeping the Coins SecureWhile the Wild West nature of crypto land can be exciting, it can also be dangerous as criminals hack exchanges to steal whatever they can get their hands on. The brothers are very keen on keeping their cryptocurrency safe, so they went to an extreme in order to do so.The printed out their various Bitcoin keys and then cut up the individual sheets of paper into pieces. They then put those pieces into different envelopes and mailed them to a number of bank safety deposit boxes spread throughout the United States. If a thief wants to get an entire key, they would have to pilfer every single safety deposit box in order to do so.Of course, us mere mortals can\u2019t go to such extravagant lengths as the twins have done, but it\u2019s a pretty good idea. What is most fascinating is that the Winklevoss brothers saw the writing on the wall early for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and they\u2019re big believers. They operate the Gemini exchange and hold about $350 million more in virtual currency, with most of that total in Ethereum. As for the massive price spike in Bitcoin, the brothers have no intention on selling. Tyler Winklevoss says:We still think it is probably one of the best investments in the world and will be for the decades to come. And if it\u2019s not, we\u2019d rather live with disappointment than regret.What do you think about how the Winklevoss twins are keeping their Bitcoin keys secure?

The good news is that developers are making progress towards the Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN) implementation. LN promises to reduce Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees dramatically, and achieve near-instant transactions. You can test a Bitcoin LN transaction right now.Lightning Network Promises to Reduce Transaction Costs and Confirmation DelaysBitcoin users are unhappy about the high costs of transaction fees. Bitcoin average transaction fees have spectacularly surged from about $0.69 USD in January 2017, to over $28 USD on December 18, as shown in the chart below. BitInfoCharts provide this chart.Moreover, the Bitcoin network traffic has become clogged due to the rising demand for transactions per block. As a result, confirming Bitcoin transactions is taking an extremely long time. Bitpay explains:Block sizes are limited, so this means that transactions which exceed the capacity for a block get stuck in a queue for confirmation by bitcoin miners. This queue of unconfirmed transactions is called the bitcoin mempool.Now, Bitcoin enthusiasts and cryptocurrency experts are centering their hopes on the LN approach to reduce transactions fees and long time-delays.Solving Bitcoin Scalability ProblemThe Bitcoin Lightning Network is essentially a decentralized system where users can set up trustless micropayment channels to conduct one or multiple payment transactions off-blockchain.These channels reside outside the Bitcoin blockchain. However, once the payment channel is closed, the transactions that occurred between the channels are then broadcast, as a single transaction, to the main blockchain network. Thus, no matter the number of micro-transactions conducted, the blockchain is accessed only twice, when the channel is opened and when the channel is closed. Obviously, this approach would significantly reduce the load on the blockchain.Presently, three teams are independently working on the LN implementation: ACINQ, Blockstream, and Lightning Labs. In early December 2017, they announced that their respective systems had completed payment tests on the main Bitcoin network. Moreover, these tests achieved interoperability across all three implantations.Right now, to educate potential LN users, the website https://htlc.me/ allows you try a testnet Bitcoin LN transaction. Reddit user Nabugu provides the details of the test here.As demand for Bitcoin continues to grow, transaction costs and time delays are bound to get worse. However, many Bitcoin enthusiasts and experts are excited about LN. For example, Ryan Radloff, co-founder, and principal at CoinShares, explicitly told CNBC that LN was the solution, adding:[LN] is a technological implementation that, later this year, is going to solve this [problem], and we\u2019re very excited about that.What do you think would be the impact on the cryptocurrency ecosystem when Bitcoin Lightning Network starts allowing users to make cheap micropayments at near-instant speed?

Historically, diamonds have been a consistent store of value, just like gold and other precious metals, so why aren\u2019t more investors looking at diamonds as an investment vehicle?Despite their total market value, diamonds are not considered a financial asset class and, as such, there is no established market for their trade, unlike traditional commodities. CEDEX aims to change all of that with the launch of the first certified blockchain-based exchange that will tokenize and transform diamonds into a tradeable asset.Removing the Barriers to Entry for Diamond InvestingThe CEDEX platform removes the three major issues facing the diamond market that have kept it from being a viable alternative investment class \u2013 lack of transparency, lack of liquidity, and lack of standardization.Lack of TransparencyThe diamond industry is plagued by obfuscation, both deliberate and unintentional. A lack of clear and transparent pricing, coupled with markups, list prices, and a \u201cclosed shop\u201d mentality makes it very difficult for the average investor to understand how a diamond is valued and how to gauge its worth.CEDEX uses a proprietary machine learning algorithm called DEX that rates a diamond\u2019s asking price by taking into account the stone\u2019s gem composite (GIA), parallel trades, and market trends. The result is an objective market value, that doesn\u2019t require investors to be diamond experts to understand.Lack of LiquidityThe basis of any commodities market is an asset\u2019s liquidity \u2013 that is, the ability to buy an asset and then sell it at some point in the future at a gain. The diamond market is decidedly illiquid. Most diamonds are sold to consumers in one-sided transactions and places anyone wishing to resell their stones at a severe disadvantage. The way the market is currently structured, consumers wishing to resell their diamonds never realize a gain on their initial purchase. They are forced to sell at a loss, often as much as 50%.CEDEX addresses the liquidity issue through the tokenization of the diamonds on its platform. Diamond dealers and private sellers have more options with regards to selling their stones the barrier to entry for investing is much lower so more people will be able to invest in diamonds than ever before.Lack of StandardizationWhen someone invests in gold, they are investing in a standardized, fungible asset. An ounce of gold is an ounce of gold \u2013 there is no deviation in composition or value between ounces. Diamonds are a different story \u2013 no two stones are alike, making it difficult to establish a standardized valuation.The CEDEX platform creates a single benchmark for each diamond category so that buyers and sellers can easily see how one diamond rates against other stones in the same category.CEDEX Token OfferingThe CEDEX token offering will take place in two stages \u2013 the pre-sale and the main sale. There is a total token supply of 100 million CEDEX Coins, of which 50 million is being offered to the public \u2013 up to 10 million tokens during the pre-sale and the remainder during the main sale.The pre-sale will take place on January 12, 2018, at 19:00 GMT and last for ten days or until all 10 million tokens have been sold, whichever comes first. Any tokens not sold during the pre-sale will be added to the main sale\u2019s token supply.The start date of the main sale will be determined by the pre-sale\u2019s performance. If the pre-sale is completed within the first 24 hours, that is, if all 10 million tokens are sold during that period, then the main sale will begin on January 13, 2018, at 19:00 GMT. Otherwise, the main sale will begin at 19:00 GMT on February 9, 2018. In either case, the main sale will last for 28 days or until the maximum cap is reached.Investors will be able to purchase CEDEX Coins using Ether, Bitcoin, or fiat currencies. During the token sale, CEDEX Coins will be sold at a rate of 1 ETH = 500 CEDEX Coins. The token supply will be created during the token sale and distributed upon its completion. Any tokens offered for sale to the public that are not sold will be burned (destroyed).Participants in the token sale will receive the following special bonuses:Pre-sale: Buyers of the first 10% of available tokens will receive 0.3 CEDEX Coins for every CEDEX Coin purchased;First day of main sale: Buyers of the first 40% of available tokens will receive 0.15 CEDEX Coins for every CEDEX Coin purchased.For more information please visit the CEDEX website.

However, its allure cannot be ignored. The fact that it continues to grow in price and popularity makes people want it even more. Based on its upward trajectory, who wouldn\u2019t want a piece of Bitcoin?Money to Be Made From MiningAbout 18,000 investors from over 54 countries turned to the Mining Max platform to help them capitalize on the crypto industry. The benefits they promised didn\u2019t just stop at Bitcoin though. According to the International Business Times, their high-performing mining farm in Seoul mined cryptocurrencies from different blockchains, supposedly giving these investors the option of putting their money on currencies that would offer higher returns.About 14,000 investors are from South Korea. A total of 2,600 is from the US, 600 are from China and the rest are from Japan and other countries.Classic Pyramid SchemeStay Safe Online did a review article in June this year that not only detailed their tiered ROI structure but also raised the question of whether or not Mining Max was a scam.Even though they promised these high returns based on their mining activities, the platform\u2019s money was actually made through a pyramid scheme. Users would have to pay to become members and then were compensated for recruiting new business.The cracks began to show when their mining endeavors failed to make enough money to pay their lower-level investors. According to Yonhap News Agency, those higher up on the food chain were paid with funds obtained through the scam, in addition to certain expensive items.Fraud, Interpol, and a Cool $250 MillionA total of 21 suspects were charged with fraud and violating South Korea\u2019s law on door-to-door sales. Three other people with ties to the company, including Korean singer Park Jung-Woon, were charged with embezzlement but were not held.Another seven co-conspirators, including Mining Max chairman, Daniel Park, its vice chairman and high-level investors have gone into hiding, but have been placed on one of Interpol\u2019s wanted lists.According to Yonhap, investors were scammed out of approximately $250 million, of which $80 million was spent on mining hardware. About $110 million is probably sitting in offshore accounts somewhere, while the remaining money was used to pay high-level investors, and of course, to line the pockets of the platform\u2019s management team.Do you think that we\u2019ll be seeing more of these kinds of schemes as cryptocurrencies become more popular?

I\u2019m pretty sure that the first caveman who found a pretty rock probably got clobbered in the head by another caveman who wanted it. In our digital age, it only takes some code and an internet connection to allow someone on the other side of the world to steal some of your assets.

However, the downside is that there\u2019s often little to no recourse if something bad happens. It\u2019s very sad to read the comments on the attacker\u2019s ether wallet listing from the victims. However, I think the pleas for the hacker to return the stolen Ether will fall on deaf ears.The virtual world can be a dangerous place for the honest person. It seems that some major new hack comes along every few weeks that targets some crypto exchange. Youbit, the South Korean exchange, just announced it was declaring bankruptcy after losing 17% of its net assets due to several hacks. The first hack to hit Youbit occurred in April and saw 4,000 BTC get snatched away, and the exchange was never able to recover.North Korea has made hacking attempts at multiple exchanges in South Korea and has recently upped their game to use fake job offers and fake Facebook profiles to gain access to cryptocurrency exchanges. And let\u2019s not forget about NiceHash, the cryptocurrency mining marketplace, that recently was hacked to the tune of 4,700 bitcoins, which is currently worth almost $80 million.As for EtherDelta, they did release a video showing users how to safely transfer their funds.Where you impacted by the hacking of EtherDelta?

But with the recent news about Bitcoin Cash being listed on Coinbase, much uncertainty has been thrown into the market.The Biggest Smart Contract PlatformEthereum has more than tripled in the past three months, with the market price at $255 just three months ago to over $800 today. The rally appears to not be stopping, however, as some exchanges are posting numbers well above market price. On one exchange, CEX.io, the price broke through the $900 barrier. While it has dropped since, it\u2019s clear that as people start researching Bitcoin and digital currencies in general, altcoins are valid options for those looking to diversify.Ethereum has been around since 2014 and its native currency is the \u201cEther.\u201d It touts itself as a \u201cSmart Contract Platform,\u201d as opposed to Bitcoin being a payment platform. A smart contract is simply a piece of software that executes an action, and once executed cannot be stopped/altered. Since it is all code, the contract can be audited and verified that it will do exactly what the developer says it will do.An example smart contract on Ethereum. Source: https://www.ethereum.org/token.Here is a very simple example of a smart contract. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m a YouTuber, and you\u2019re a company looking to advertise on my videos. I put a short ten-second ad at the beginning of each of my videos, and in return, you\u2019ll pay me $1 for every 1000 views. Now I could trust you so that when I reach a view threshold, you\u2019ll pay me. Or we could get a third party involved to ensure I get paid. But with a smart contract, it could automatically pay me. It could check the YouTube video statistics for views every so often, and pay me accordingly. All in a completely trustless way.Ethereum and The Coinbase EffectThere is also something to be said about access to different coins for new investors. Ethereum might be experiencing what I\u2019m going to call the \u201cCoinbase Effect,\u201d which is the fact that the currencies that are currently listed on Coinbase are pretty much the only ones the average-Joe investor knows about. Since these are the only ones available on Coinbase, which is a major on-ramp for non-technical users, they\u2019ll tend to invest in these currencies over others.With Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash going head to head, and accusations of conspiracy flying every which way, many may be looking at ETH as a haven for their newly found gains from Bitcoin. Because it\u2019s listed on Coinbase, investors can easily convert their current holdings to Ethereum. Ethereum is not without problems of their own, however.Earlier this month, CryptoKitties pressed the network against its limits. As a result, Ethereum users saw fees approaching $1 or higher, which is completely unheard of for most cryptos, especially Ethereum. We\u2019ll see in the coming weeks whether this rally has any substance behind it, or if it is just a pump and dump.Are you invested in Ethereum?

Others are banking on technology and building supercomputers, but even that is not enough.Early Bitcoin investors who bought the cryptocurrency while it was still in its infancy stand to profit the most from its recent explosive gains. However, some investors have long since forgotten their wallet passwords, and some are on the verge of going crazy as they try to remember. Hypnotist to the RescueRelief for some of the investors in this situation has come in the form of a hypnotist from South Carolina. Jason Miller claims to have developed techniques that enable his clients to recall deep and forgotten memories, according to his interview with The Wall Street Journal. However, his services come at a significant cost, considering Bitcoin\u2019s current value. Jason Miller charges one Bitcoin in addition to 5% of the total amount recovered. Going by the current Bitcoin value, his services would cost at least $18,000. On the plus side, you don\u2019t have to pay up if you don\u2019t remember.Resetting is Not an OptionIf you lose your bank account password, all you needed to do to recover it is call your bank, answer a few questions, and have them reset the password. This is not the case with Bitcoin. Bitcoin wallets are secured with complex passwords and security keys that are designed to keep hackers out. Only the wallet\u2019s owner knows the password, and there is no way to recover it \u2013 unless you are a really good hacker. This is just what one hacker has in mind. Mr. Philip Neumeier bought 15 bitcoins in 2013 for $260. His stash of Bitcoins is worth $300,000 today, but he has long forgotten his password. However, instead of visiting a hypnotist, Mr. Neumeier has decided to design a supercomputer that will crack his wallet open. The task is so demanding that the supercomputer sits in a 270-gallon tank of special mineral water to keep it cool. Even with his computer hacking away at the problem 24/7, Neumeier estimates that it will take about 300 years to get the work done \u2013 hopefully, it will all be worth it if Bitcoin continues growing in value.A Heartbreaking CaseOne case, in particular, is extraordinary. Mr. James Howells bought 7.500 Bitcoins when the cryptocurrency was still new, but he threw away the hard drive where he had stored them in 2013. The bitcoins would be worth over $126 million today, but locating the landfill where his hard drive currently sits awaiting recycling is like finding a needle in a haystack and no amount of hypnotherapy or hacking resources can help him recover it.What would you do if you forgot your Bitcoin wallet\u2019s password?

In the past few weeks, IOTA\u2019s value has skyrocketed by 400 percent. Now, IOTA\u2019s prospects look even brighter, as Robert Bosch Venture Capital announced that it is investing in IOTA.Robert Bosch Ventura Capital to Industrialize IOTA TechnologyThe Stuttgart-based Robert Bosch Venture Capital (RBVC), the corporate venture capital company of the Bosch Group, is joining forces with the IOTA Foundation, which is the central body of the altcoin. In this regard, RBVC announced that it had purchased a significant number of IOTA tokens. Dr. Ingo Ramesohl, Managing Director at RBVC, said:The investment in IOTA\u2019s token, the first ever token investment of RBVC, will help us working closely with the IOTA Foundation to explore the industrialization of this exciting technology.IOTA teams and the Bosch Group have been in contact since 2015, working on several projects. David S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8, co-founder of IOTA, said:The decision by RBVC to acquire a significant amount of IOTA tokens solidifies the idea of the Machine Economy and how significant leaders in this space share our vision.The RBVC investment follows the release of the Data Marketplace last November. The Data Marketplace allows users to store, sell, and access data streams securely. According to the IOTA Foundation, over 30 companies are participating in the Data Marketplace project, such as Accenture, Bosch, Fujitsu, and Microsoft.IOTA Introduces a Technology Paradigm ShiftIOTA\u2019s revolutionary technology\u2019s primary focus is on enabling the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. IOTA promises unlimited scalability and feeless micro or even nano-transactions.In the IOTA ecosystem, there is no blockchain. Instead, there is the tangle, which is a directed acyclic graph for storing transactions. Because there are no blocks and no miners, validation of transactions occurs as follows:There are no miners. What this means is that each participant in the network that wants to make a transaction has to actively participate in the consensus of the network by approving two past transactions. This attestation on the validity of two past transactions ensures that the whole network achieves consensus on the current state of approved transactions, and it enables a variety of unique features that are only seen in IOTA.For further technical information, you may wish to read the IOTA whitepaper here.After just a few months, IOTA already boasts a market cap of over $14 billion USD. IOTA is introducing a paradigm shift in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and as reflected by the markets, it is attracting investors and enthusiasts on the idea of the Machine Economy. The RBVC investment will undoubtedly help to boost the development of this revolutionary technology.What are your thoughts about having crypto transactions that are not validated by miners?

Its massive growth in 2017 has experts scrambling to predict where it will go to from here. It reached the $20K mark on some exchanges last week, with its integration to the mainstream financial industry well underway with CBOE and CME futures trading.Crypto enthusiasts have faith that this is just the beginning, with Bitcoin advocate Michael Novogratz forecasting that the currency will be trading at $50K by the end of next year.Making Millionaires One Bitcoin at a TimeSome traders have taken this prediction to heart, or wallet, based on trading data on LedgerX. According to Express, a Bitcoin bet of a million dollars was placed by one or more traders, wagering that the world\u2019s most popular crypto would reach $50K by the close of 2018.The e-market start-up company\u2019s chief executive, Paul Chou, can\u2019t name names due to privacy regulations, but he did hint that it was probably a hedge fund behind the six-figure bet. He said:Without a doubt, there are institutions out there that are looking at these types of trades or have done these types of trades. It\u2019s not an individual, let\u2019s put it that way.D-Day is set for the 28th of December 2018. In the event that Bitcoin is trading at $50K or more on that day, the bidders will be able to purchase 275 bitcoins at $50K each. However, if the currency is trading at less than that, the bidders will get nothing, except the knowledge that they are short $1 million.Continous Growth and Bubble ThreatsAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at just over $17K, compared to just under $1K in January this year. This is a growth of over 1,700% in less than a year. In addition, the currency grew by over 80% in this month alone.In the case of Bitcoin, every silver lining seems to have a cloud. As the excited voices of enthusiasts grow louder, so do the bubble chants of critics such as Jamie Dimon and Jordan Belfort.Nicholas Gregory, who is the CEO of the cryptocurrency business enabler, CommerceBlock, gave a bit of cautionary advice on Bitcoin\u2019s price:Once Bitcoin starts to behave more in tune with traditional foreign exchange markets, people\u2019s faith in it will only grow. However, that means it is not immune, and should not be immune, from price corrections either.Even though naysayers have been vocal with their criticism, it only seems to spur Bitcoin on, always putting it ahead of the pack in terms of price and popularity.Do you think Bitcoin will reach the $50K mark by December next year?

Try These Workarounds Samuel Rae | Dec 21, 2017 | 13:15 Share Tweet Send Share Your Bitcoin transactions don\u2019t have to be expensive and slow. With a little bit of know-how and pre-planning, you can keep transaction times and fees at a manageable level.High transaction fees and long processing delays are top of the list when it comes to issues (and, in turn, discussion) surrounding Bitcoin right now and for good reason. The network is choking on the huge influx of volume seen over the last six months or so and \u2013 in its current format \u2013 it simply can\u2019t handle the issues that scaling has brought to the table.This doesn\u2019t mean that Bitcoin is in trouble in the long term, of course. There are protocols being developed \u2013 like Lightning Network \u2013 to relieve transaction congestion on the blockchain. While the teams working on the challenge work their magic, however, Bitcoin users need to find ways to get around the problems they are experiencing NOW when trying to send and receive bitcoin.Enter this guy.His name is Ryan Walker (Twitter @Ryan0Walker) and he is a self-proclaimed crypto enthusiast who has come up with a great guide for beginners and old hats alike, detailing exactly how, in many cases, users can get around long verification waits and exorbitant transaction fees.Here\u2019s the Tweet with which he announced his guide:Been helping people learn how #bitcoin transactions can be relatively cheap as long as they aren't URGENT. Made a decision tree to help. Until scaling solutions (lightning, schnorr) arrive you should still rarely ever pay more then $1 to transfer non-urgent transactions. pic.twitter.com/ZnyTMbScxu\u2014 Ryan Walker (@Ryan0Walker) December 18, 2017Basically, through using either GreenAddress or a hardware wallet (Trezor, for example), you can overcome pretty much every issue outlined above, with the choice of these two options rooted in whether the transaction is urgent, whether you and the person you are sending to are using Coinbase, and whether your keys are in hot or cold storage.There\u2019s one exception \u2013 if you\u2019re sending bitcoin from Coinbase to someone that\u2019s not a Coinbase user, you\u2019re still going to have to pay a lot to do it and you\u2019re going to have to wait a while for the transaction to complete.There\u2019s one other option that we thought was well worth a mention and it\u2019s a service currently being provided mining pool ViaBTC. It\u2019s called Transaction Accelerator and it involves the pool prioritizing transactions that are submitted to it to be included in the next block that it mines.Of course, this prioritization is limited in scope, so you\u2019ve got to be fast. The company is currently offering 100 free accelerations per hour and it\u2019s first come, first served, with a fresh batch accepted at the top of each hour (so, for example, at 19:00, 20:00 etc.Are you using any of these workarounds?

From announcing new strategic partnerships to upgrading key systems on its platform, RCN is working hard to deliver the best possible services and features to its users.RCN Announces Decentraland PartnershipEarlier this week, RCN announced their new partnership with Decentraland, the blockchain-based virtual reality platform where users can acquire virtual land to create and monetize their content.In addition to exploring and interacting with Decetraland\u2019s 3D virtual world, users can also purchase land as well, creating an immutable record of ownership on the Ethereum blockchain.Decentraland\u2019s unique VR platform has strong support among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, gamers, and real estate developers.Under the new partnership, RCN will be able to integrate its credit protocol with the Decentraland platform. This will enable users who own plots of land, content, or businesses created in the 3D world to issue and receive loans. Development of this \u201cvirtual loans network\u201d is expected to begin in Q2 2018.Decentraland Project Lead Ariel Meilich spoke about the partnership, stating:We\u2019re really excited to work with the RCN team. Their project is one the most interesting ventures made on crypto and I believe that, once combined with ours, it will bring great value and open some really cool opportunities to the Decentraland ecosystem.RCN Platform UpgradesAs you no doubt know, the Ethereum blockchain has been receiving an unusually high number of transactions over the last few weeks. This is due to a combination of the recent ETH price rally as well as the CryptoKitties phenomenon that has swept through the crypto community.These significant delays resulted in some of the RCN credit loans not being funded. Previously, whenever certain lending transactions remained pending, all actions taken by the same lender would fail due to a larger nonce.To address the issue, the RCN development team has made some improvements in the exchange transaction generation process, managing the nonce of all transactions, and adjusting the gas price setting model used by the platform. RCN believes that these upgrades will improve performance, speed up transactions, and reduce withdrawal and collection fail rates.What do you think of RCN\u2019s new partnership with Decentraland?

A while back, a crypto enthusiast calling himself \u201cPine\u201d founded the Pineapple Fund, which was valued at 5057 BTC ($86 million). To date, the Pineapple Fund had committed $8 million to eight charities.Reports indicate that Pine began to mine Bitcoin on an old PC at home when the currency was still quite new. Unlike most early adopters, Pine did not sell his Bitcoin, deciding to hodl them instead. Needless to say, that decision really paid off. Bitcoin has, in recent years, rallied from just $200 to over $18,000.According to a Reddit post, Pine will donate most of his bitcoins. He said this was because Bitcoin had changed his life and that he had more money than he would ever spend in his life. He says:I have far more money than I can ever spend. My aims, goals, and motivations in life have nothing to do with having XX million or being the mega rich. So I\u2019m doing something else: donating the majority of my bitcoins to charitable causes.What Will the Fund Focus On?The Pineapple Fund is expected to focus most of its donations on mental health, medical research, environmental issues, and wildlife. It will also focus on the fight against domestic violence, sexual abuse, and technology. Pine said that it was not because he thought these were more important than other issues. It was just that they aligned perfectly with his unique set of values. Featuring the speed and decentralization of the crypto world, Pine went to Reddit to request for some assistance on where to donate. In a short while, Pine had committed to donating to various charities such as the SENS Research Foundation, an institute that researches aging, and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), whose research is on marijuana and psychedelics. MAPS confirmed that it had, in fact, received a million dollars worth of BTC from Pine, which will be used for their upcoming trials featuring a drug similar to ecstasy in the use of treating post-traumatic stress disorder.A New Style of GivingIt seemed that Pine\u2019s charitable gift inspired others. Later on, MAPS was given a second donation worth 51.5BTC, which is equal to about a million dollars, from an anonymous donor. Brad Burge, the communications director for MAPS, says that those donations far outstripped the total of cryptocurrency donated to the organization since 2013, which had been $120,800.Burge thinks that a new era in charitable giving is starting. Charities will now just need to post a public wallet where people can send their deposits. He said that he expected this to become quite standard in coming months. Emmett Carson, a founder of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, said that he expected crypto coins to begin shaping philanthropy. He noted that donors from the tech industry were starting out younger than their predecessors and that most of the philanthropists were donating in the same way they made their money. They were simply finding a few worthy causes and donating to them in large quantities.As for the Pineapple Fund, it has given away $8 million so far to charities. Pine has stated that he will not give to individuals, which is probably a smart move.What are your thoughts on this new style of philanthropy in the cryptocurrency world?

Alarming Bitcoin Power Consumption Projections May Not Be Accurate Jeff Francis | Dec 22, 2017 | 11:30 Share Tweet Send Share There\u2019s been a lot of hype about Bitcoin power consumption, with many outlets saying that it\u2019s getting out of control. However, it may be that such alarmist rhetoric may not be true.This has been a remarkable year for Bitcoin, skyrocketing in value to heights few would have believed several years ago. Yet one aspect of the daddy of cryptocurrency has been generating dramatic and alarmist headlines: the energy needed to both mine Bitcoin and for transacting it. A great deal of worry and hand-wringing has been done as some say that the current pace of power use will soon outstrip that of the United States and, eventually, the world. Yet it may be that the fretting over Bitcoin power consumption is overblown.Dire PredictionsSpearheading the charge about the immense power needed to both mine and transact Bitcoin is the Digiconomist website. The site reports that the current estimated electricity consumption by Bitcoin is 36.32 TWh. Broken down, this energy could supply over 3 million homes in the United States. This energy is also more than that consumed by 19 European countries.But it seems that the cryptocurrency isn\u2019t done yet. Estimates have said that the Bitcoin network will use more energy than that of the entire United States by July 2019. Then in early 2020, the virtual currency will gobble up more energy than the entire world does today. Compounding the issue is the worry over the carbon footprint of Bitcoin, which is due to the fact that China is the number one miner of bitcoins, and the majority of their electrical power comes from coal-based power plants. Even blackouts in countries like Venezuela are blamed on Bitcoin miners using too much power.Such numbers and predictions have been broadcast far and wide, even here on Bitcoinist. Everybody has taken the numbers put out by Digiconomist as gospel, but are they?Will Bitcoin Gobble Up the World\u2019s Power?A report by CNBC says \u201cnot so fast\u201d when it comes to all the alarmist talk about Bitcoin power consumption. They note that a number of experienced energy and IT researchers say that such predictions are highly questionable. In fact, all the talk about the energy use is supposedly based upon a single estimate.The energy and IT researches point out the biggest flaw in all the hyperbole \u2013 there\u2019s no hard data to back any of the claims up. Nobody has gone to any of the data centers that are doing the mining and collected any information on exactly how much energy they\u2019re using.An assistant professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, Christian Catalini, says:Many of those calculations that you see today I think are based on very weak assumptions. I don\u2019t think anybody can make a credible claim about the current [power use] without actually having data from the miners.Jonathan Koomey is a pioneer in the study of electrical usage from IT equipment, has decades of experience, and is a Stanford University lecturer. He says that the Digiconomist model is fundamentally flawed as that it backs into the crypto\u2019s power consumption by estimating the revenue and expenses for miners. He told CNBC:Any time you do that, you introduce multiple layers of error and uncertainty. It\u2019s a completely unreliable way to do the analysis, and no credible energy analyst would ever do that.Then there\u2019s the fact that the man behind Digiconomist, Alex de Vries, has a background in data and risk analysis but has no previous experience in energy economics. Nonetheless, he stands by his predictions.Another doubter is Jens Malmodin, a senior specialist in sustainability at Ericsson Research. He finds it unlikely that the model by Digiconomist shows that Bitcoin devours double the total energy use of Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple, and Microsoft combined.Are We Heading to a Power Apocalypse Caused by Bitcoin?While it is true that Bitcoin mining and trading do consume a lot of power, it does not mean that the end is nigh. Koomey says the current hysteria is following the same pattern when the internet first arose. Everybody assumed that the electrical use by the internet would grow exponentially by a factor of 8 or more. However, power usage eventually moderated as equipment and technology scaled up.Other factors that could enter play with the power needed for Bitcoin would be new protocols that would use less energy, continued efficiency gains as the crypto scales up, or a crash in price. In essence, it\u2019s not a given that the power usage will necessarily continue to climb. Koomey also points out that if all the predictions are right, the actual amount of mining power consumption would only be a fraction of 1% of global demand. In other words, keep calm and don\u2019t panic.Are you worried about Bitcoin power consumption? Do you think the dire predictions made are accurate?

As panic and hysteria ripples through social media crypto groups, largely populated by inexperienced traders, those holding Ripple have reason to smile.Ripple\u2019s XRP token has surpassed Bitcoin Cash by market capacity in the past few hours, surging 28% to an all-time peak of $1.38. At the time of writing, it is in third place in the crypto charts, boasting a market cap of $46.4 billion, ahead of BCH with its $44.3 billion.One in FiveFour of the top five cryptocurrencies have been suffering an attack of the bears for the past day or so, except XRP, which is extremely bullish.Since the end of May, Ripple had been slumbering in a channel between $0.15 and $0.28. There had been no momentum in either direction, and many had almost written off the altcoin. Things started to happen around December 12th when key resistance was broken, and XRP headed towards its previous high back in May of $0.40.This month alone, it has jumped almost 475% from $0.24 at the beginning of December to a Ripple record of $1.38 a couple of hours ago, according to Coinmarketcap. Around $3.6 billion have been traded in Ripple in the past 24 hours alone.Asian AppetiteNews that over 60 banks in Japan and South Korea would be using the Ripple blockchain to test inter-bank transfers sent the price soaring last week. Over a quarter of all crypto trade volume comes from these two countries alone, so it is pretty obvious where the impetus has come from. Ripple has been boosted recently by large trading volumes at South Korean exchange Bithumb and Hong Kong-based Bitfinex.Additionally, news that XRP may be listed on Coinbase when it opens the platform to new altcoins next year would have also have an impact. Ripple is one of the oldest and most established of all cryptocurrencies, so investors have made it one of their targets for long trades. Once large exchanges such as Coinbase add support for altcoins, their exposure to the public is greatly increased. The easier it is to buy them, the more volume we will see.Many are skeptical about Ripple due to its involvement with traditional banking institutions, but they will be taking notice now as it is the only green coin in a sea of red today.Does XRP go against crypto ethos or would you buy it?

Traders using Bitcoin India have found this out the hard way as the exchange has locked them out of their accounts for up to a month.According to Factor Daily, Bitcoin India, founded in 2014 and headquartered in Andhra Pradesh\u2019s Prakasam district, is one of the few exchanges in India that supports multiple cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Dash, Litecoin, and others, in addition to the mining contracts that it offers.Locked OutTraders and investors, many holding fiat currency in their accounts, have been locked out for almost a month, unable to trade or withdraw any of their funds. Many have become annoyed at the fact they have missed out on the biggest bull run Bitcoin and altcoins have had to date. One told local media:I have around Rs 10 lakh ($US15.6K) in cash and Rs 30 lakh ($US47K) worth of cryptocurrencies locked in my account since November. I could have easily made Rs 5 lakh ($7,800) in profit if I was able to access and trade in my account.According to a number of investors on the Bitcoin India platform, the lockout began in September when they started to receive messages and pop-ups saying that they have been logged out of their accounts due to suspicious activity or exceeding trade limits. Traders insist there was no clause in their agreement with Bitcoin India of any limit on trades.Bitcoin India told a Delhi-based networking engineer that he had crossed his buy and sell limit. To that, he says:I had joined Bitcoin India because they showed better rates for cryptocurrencies and had also offered more cryptocurrencies to trade. We were also able to do multiple trades and company had said that we were allowed to do unlimited trades on the platform.UnresponsiveAttempts by local traders and media to contact the company have so far been fruitless. However, in a press release on Thursday, Bitcoin India said:Due to recent unexpected user growth that is driven by soaring demand in Asia to buy/sell digital assets, which lead us to get huge number of support tickets all of sudden, we are currently experiencing delays resolving support tickets. Our team is working through these tickets as quickly as possible and we are adding additional resources to get through the backlog.The lesson to learn from this is that unregulated exchanges can do what they want, so it is best to store your crypto in a private online or hardware wallet, not on the exchange.Where do you store your crypto: exchange or wallet?

The Asian trading session often dictates how the rest of the day will play out when traders wake up in Europe and the US. However, the governments of the region are growing uneasy about the increasing appetite their people have for cryptocurrencies.One of the world\u2019s largest exchanges, Bitfinex, is owned by a Hong Kong-based company. South Korea\u2019s Bithumb is also a huge player for crypto trading volume, and then there is Binance, bitFlyer, and Coinone, all based in Southeast Asia. There is no doubt that Asians are the driving force when it comes to trade volumes.Nervous GovernmentsAccording to a CNBC report, regulators in the Asia Pacific region have become increasingly uneasy with the rise in popularity of Bitcoin and its brethren. The latest to express concern was the Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, who called the recent surge in Bitcoin prices \u201cabnormal\u201d in a press conference this week. His counterparts in South Korea, Singapore, and Australia have echoed the sentiment.Huge volatility has been cited as reason for regulation. Bitcoin has lost over 30% in less than a week, and most of the altcoins are currently following its fall, at least temporarily. With large regulated US exchanges and institutions, including Goldman Sachs, CBoE, CME, and TD Ameritrade, taking an interest and starting to offer products based on cryptocurrencies, the governments in Asia want it under control.Authority RulesMany countries in Southeast Asia, including China, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Cambodia, have virtually no democracy and are managed by single-party politics or military regimes. The only thing that matters is control; the human rights and civil liberties that we enjoy in the West are forgotten dreams in much of Asia.After its market-shaking move to prohibit ICO trading in September, China stands by its stance that the unregulated market could pose major financial risks to the world\u2019s second largest economy. The People\u2019s Bank of China is in support of the technology, though, and moves to launch its own sovereign virtual currency are underway. Chinese platforms, such as NEO, are already in use and have a lot of future potential.Japan is one of the few Asian countries to officially recognize and legalize cryptocurrencies and exchanges. There are currently no plans to release an official state coin, but there is a Japanese crypto called Monacoin in use in the country, and Cardano has been dubbed by some as the Ethereum of Japan.South Korea and India are concerned about money laundering and illegal use of cryptocurrencies for criminal purposes, so they are seeking to regulate exchanges and demand more personal information from those that want to trade. Indonesia and Vietnam are both in the process of banning Bitcoin and crypto outright, while Thailand and Singapore have both issued alerts about the risks but continue to allow trading and exchanges.Will regulation in Asia impact the global market?

Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning. It is morning at sea for bitcoin futures. Sails are on the horizon. Some have the colors of merchant ships; others are flying the king\u2019s standard.The Long and Short of Bitcoin FuturesThe Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) priced bitcoin (BTC) futures on Sunday, December 10. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched bitcoin futures on December 18th. NASDAQ, Cantor, and Nodal also intend to launch bitcoin futures. TD Ameritrade customers will be able to buy bitcoin futures in their accounts. The merchant ships have treasure to store, and the admiralty wishes to collect taxes. The merchants will sail away to return another day, but the king\u2019s men will stay, and taxes will be paid.Traders have the opportunity to \u201cgo long\u201d the bitcoin futures and own the right to profits or the charge of losses above or below the $15,000 CBOE strike price. Those orders will be matched at auction to \u201cshorts\u201d \u2013 those who wish to sell futures for an immediate payout in dollars.LedgerX initiated a long-term equity anticipation security (LEAP) on November 18 with a strike price of $10,000 when bitcoin (BTC) was trading at about $7750. That contract, priced at $2250.25, allowed the holder to buy bitcoin for $10,000 until December 28, 2018. That $2250.25 invested for a few weeks is worth at least $6500 \u201cintrinsic value\u201d (BTC $16,500 12/11/17) plus \u201ctime value\u201d on a contract that does not expire for another year.The CBOE has a 44% margin requirement or $6600 at a strike price of $15,000. Profit or loss on the future is dependent upon price movement of bitcoin above or below that level. But the bitcoin futures trade as securities separate from the bitcoin price. The XBTF8 CBOE bitcoin future, which expires in March, reached a high of $19,330 while bitcoin was trading at less than $17,000. It took BTC ten days to reach $10,000 after LedgerX priced its Long Term Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPS) at that price.Will the high in the XBTF8 set Sunday be a self-fulfilling prophecy and propel the price of bitcoin higher? Or will those who have long doubted the legitimacy of bitcoin at last be able to profit from their predictions of doom by selling the futures short? A CBOE member may short up to 5000 contracts. For each $1000 drop in the value of the bitcoin contract, such an investor would experience a $5 million gain in account value.Separating Bitcoin from the BlockchainBitcoin is a blockchain performing the most primitive of mathematical functions in a highly complex way. Bitcoin counts. What once is counted, cannot be uncounted. Bitcoin has counted more than 500,000 blocks without a breaking the chain. The longer the chain, the harder to trace back to the start of its encrypted maze. Its length and strength are trusted more with each additional block. This simplest of arithmetic, repeated every ten minutes for nearly nine years, has been trusted with over $250 billion. The more bitcoin secures, the more it is trusted.\u201cTrust\u201d is cited four times in the first paragraph of the white paper Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in 2008 to describe \u201ca purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash\u2026.\u201d He states that our current fiat currency system depends upon \u201ctrusted third parties to process electronic payments\u201d and proposes a system that eliminates the need for trust by eliminating the possibility of reversing a transaction. Since every cryptographic \u201cblock\u201d in the bitcoin \u201cchain\u201d is a lockbox that cannot be unlocked without first unlocking its successor, the more blocks in the chain, the more secure each predecessor becomes.Each block in a chain can contain and secure any information its creator desires. But bitcoin records only bitcoin transactions. Blockchain, as a continuously growing list of encrypted records, has been applied beyond currency to more the complex requirements financial accounting, industrial logistics, and electronic recordkeeping. Blocks can be \u201cpermissioned\u201d so that only certain digitally identified individuals may access the information within.Banks, regulators, and technology firms have joined Consortium to support its Corda distributed ledger platform on the Amazon Web Services marketplace. IBM Global Financing has moved all the information of 4000 partners and suppliers to the IBM Blockchain. In Sweden, Georgia, and Ukraine, property registers are being stored with blockchain. Several states have changed laws to allow blockchain technology to be used in real estate transactions.New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley has previously stated:It\u2019s really very premature to be talking about the Federal Reserve offering digital currencies, but it is something we are thinking about.Looking Beyond BitcoinBitcoin was blockchain\u2019s Kitty Hawk, and bitcoin.org was its Wright brothers. Passengers signed up, more wings were added, and now the simplest of aircraft flies better than ever. According to Nakamoto\u2019s estimate: \u201cA block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes.\u201d The average bitcoin block size is now over the one-megabyte capacity originally coded into the algorithm at creation. Bitcoin can process approximately seven transactions per second, while Visa can process 17,000. Passengers on the bitcoin airline were restricted to a one-megabyte carry-on, and the time to add new wings for additional passengers lengthened to a point where some were unable to fly. They looked for alternatives.Bitcoin Cash (BCH $1400 12/11/17) presents an eight-megabyte transaction capacity that is scalable to 32MB, non-reversible transactions, and each with a unique digital signature. BCH is made for speed. BCH multiplies bitcoin\u2019s transaction speed and significantly reduces the average transaction fee. Though few merchants accept Bitcoin Cash as payment compared to the ever-growing list that accepts bitcoin (Overstock, Virgin, Dell, Intuit), Bitcoin Cash may now have a more important function than as spendable currency.When bitcoin fell $2000 in market value after the SegWit2X failure, Bitcoin Cash rose by $2000. Those wishing to exit BTC, upon disappointment that they would receive no free coins from the failed fork had few convenient alternatives for an exit. Selling BTC to buy fiat currency (Dollars, Euro, Yen, Yuan) would involve banks, transaction fees, traces of large movements of cash, and most important, at least 48 hours of time. Selling BTC to buy BCH may have made much more sense in terms of cost, anonymity and time.Again, when the bitcoin bloodletting was over, BTC rose by $2000 and BCH fell by $2000. Both recovered to trade in new higher ranges. While the market price performances of most other crypto-currencies have lagged that of the original digital coin, bitcoin has broken out and now appears to be forming the handle of a \u201ccup-and-handle\u201d chart pattern.Half of the world\u2019s population does not have access to banks. No banks, no cash, no Visa. Where there are no banks, barter is common as a form of commerce. Indigenous people take what they can gather or produce to markets in villages, towns, and cities to trade for their immediate needs or for their country\u2019s fiat currency. Bitcoin makes barter digital. For those who long to barter their wealth with other like-minded individuals, the dream of a purely anonymous transaction in a market where concerns of trust have been eliminated has been realized.Have you traded CBOE or CME bitcoin futures?

The result is Dai, the first fully-decentralized stablecoin on Ethereum.MakerDAO was formed three years ago with a big vision of creating a stable, decentralized digital global economy. It has worked its way out of the grassroots to finally launch Dai, a promising cryptocurrency that promises stability in currency valuation. Understanding Dai\u2019s ValuationDai is currently worth 1 USD. It is designed to have low volatility against the world\u2019s leading national currencies, such as the Euro and USD. MakerDAO has two mechanisms to ensure that this happens. For starters, Dai has an autonomous system of smart contracts that monitors the market\u2019s dynamics and responds accordingly. This system is designed to be independent so that no one can alter its mechanism. As such, even MakerDAO cannot alter the system, hence ensuring that no one can manipulate Dai\u2019s value for self-gain while inconveniencing other Dai users. Secondly, Dai is backed a secured asset that is held in the Maker smart contract. Initially, this collateral will be pooled Ether that users will hand over to generate Dai. Users can retrieve their collateral by paying off the debt of the Dai that they initially received as well as a minor stability fee.Getting DaiUnlike Bitcoin, which you have to mine or purchase, you can get Dai coins by either making them or buying them. To create Dai, you have to log onto the MakerDAO platform and send Ether to the Collateralized Debt Position (CDP). Making Dai is quite easy, and you can learn more about it here. You can also always buy Dai coins if you are not in a position to create one. You can always find Dai sellers here. Take Advantage of DaiDai promises to be a stable currency for all uses, especially now that global currencies can be so volatile. It is ideal for people seeking to secure their finances as well as those seeking to take advantage of the booming popularity of digital currencies. Many people are excited of the potential of Dai. Joey Krug, the co-founder of Augur, said: When people ask me what the biggest remaining challenges in the space are I tell them scalability and stablecoins. I\u2019m really excited about Maker and Dai as I think stablecoins are key to any sort of financial contracts on Ethereum. Even if you\u2019re right, but still have the volatility of Ether, you can\u2019t speculate on many long term speculative events. I\u2019m excited to be able to use Dai within Augur\u2019s markets!Dai is still in its early stages, and its stability is expected to attract many users in the near future. The MakerDAO team is still working to improve the currency, and you can keep track of the development here. You can also get in touch with the brains behind Dai here.

Investment RisksThe first area of risk, according to Paul, is investment risk, by which he predominantly refers to the volatility of cryptocurrencies. All anyone has to do is take a look at Bitcoin\u2019s performance over the past month to understand what he is talking about. Bitcoin started off the month trading at just under $10,000 \u2013 a point of tremendous growth in and of itself \u2013 and in less than three weeks it more than doubled in value, peaking at just over $20,000.Everybody was all about the bitcoin. CBOE and CME Group rolled out Bitcoin futures, Nasdaq said it would be following suit in 2018, there was even talk about Bitcoin ETFs once again becoming a possibility. Bitcoin had finally arrived on the mainstream financial stage and it was all going to be gravy from there.Until it wasn\u2019t.Since its peak, Bitcoin has tumbled more than 40%, to a low of just over $12,000 as of this morning. Does this mean that the Bitcoin bubble has finally burst? Considering that Bitcoin has \u201ccrashed\u201d and recovered after a so-called \u201cbubble\u201d at least three times previously \u2013 once in 2011 and twice in 2013 \u2013 I think it\u2019s a little early to be throwing in the towel.My point \u2013 and the point that Paul makes in the interview \u2013 is that these massive price swings are one of the biggest risks in cryptocurrency investment. Just like stocks and equities, any cryptocurrency can fall. Maybe they rebound, maybe they fall all the way to zero. It\u2019s a crapshoot and a risk that investors need to understand and be willing to take.2. Operational RisksThe next area of risk is operational risk. In a nutshell, operational risk is anything having to do with how you interact with your cryptocurrencies. This can include storage, transferring, converting, etc.. The most significant point of risk in this area, however, is storage. Where and how cryptocurrencies are stored has a lot to do with how secure they are.Talking about storing cryptocurrency, Paul stated:[It\u2019s] a tremendous target for hackers, it\u2019s a target for thieves, including insiders, and in a large operation, and there\u2019s potentially no recourse. So you have to be really, really careful that you\u2019re storing cryptocurrency securely. And that\u2019s a serious concern.Currently, there are three primary methods of storing cryptocurrencies that most investors use:On an exchangeIn a software walletIn a hardware walletStoring Your Cryptocurrencies on an Exchange or Online WalletWhile definitely the most convenient storage method, especially if you are an active trader and/or have many different cryptocurrencies in your portfolio, keeping your coins on an exchange is the absolute most insecure way of storing them.Paul and Silverstein discuss storing cryptocurrencies on Coinbase as an example, but as far as online wallets and exchanges go, they are the exception rather than the rule. They insure their users\u2019 crypto and fiat deposits against losses due to physical or cyber security breaches as well as employee theft.Most exchanges and online wallets do not insure their users\u2019 deposits, however, so if the exchange or wallet gets hacked or the owner decides to close up shop one day and head off to a non-extradition country with your coins, you\u2019re unlikely to ever get them back.Storing Your Cryptocurrencies in a Software WalletSoftware wallets are applications that you download and install on your computer or mobile device. There are several Bitcoin software wallets to choose from and each altcoin (alternative cryptocurrency) generally has its own software wallet client as well.That last sentence illustrates the main problem with software wallets. Aside from Exodus and Coinami, there really are very few proven multi-currency software wallets available. If you only dabble in one or two cryptocurrencies, it doesn\u2019t pose a real problem, but if you have a large diversified portfolio of crypto assets, having to download and install a software wallet for each one individually can be a real inconvenience.Another drawback to software wallets is that it is easy to lock yourself out of them. If you forget your password or lose your seed key or private keys, there is no password reset function. Barring the slight chance that a crypto recovery service might be able to unlock it for you, those coins are gone, never to be recovered.Like the online wallet, there is still a chance that a software wallet can be hacked. Granted, it is more difficult, but it can still happen. All it takes is for your computer or mobile device to become infected with a keylogger and a trojan virus and a would-be hacker can see your password as you type it and can later go back and access your wallet with you never being the wiser until the next time you open it up.Storing Your Cryptocurrencies on a Hardware WalletUnlike the two \u201chot wallet\u201d options above, the hardware wallet is the only \u201ccold wallet\u201d featured in this list. The terms \u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d refer to whether or not the wallet maintains an internet connection. A hardware wallet is a physical device contains software that allows users to store one or more cryptocurrencies. The main benefit of a hardware wallet is security. Because you only need to connect it to the internet when you want to transfer coins, it is inherently less vulnerable to being hacked than online or software wallets.Although hardware wallets are the best bet from a security standpoint, they suffer from the same drawback as software wallets. You still need to remember your password (a pin number) to gain access. If you forget it or lose your private keys, there is no reset function.Trezor, Ledger, and KeepKey are three of the most popular examples of hardware wallets. All three have easy to use browser interfaces and support multiple cryptocurrencies.3. Regulatory RisksThe last area of risk that Paul discusses is regulatory risk. The laws regarding cryptocurrencies are far from standardized. What is accepted and legal in one country may be illegal in another. For example, the president of Belarus announced today that cryptocurrencies and ICOs would now be legal in the country.On the other hand, in China, ICOs are banned outright and, in countries that bother to classify it at all, bitcoin is considered a financial asset rather than a form of currency. The U.S. has some of the strictest regulatory guidelines on ICOs, resulting in many ICOs not being open to U.S. investors.Then there is the issue of taxes. Is it taxable? If it isn\u2019t considered a currency, how is it taxed? Do you only pay taxes on the cryptocurrencies you convert to fiat currency or are like-to-like transactions taxable as well?The cryptocurrency space is a regulatory minefield and it is important that you be aware of the laws and regulations regarding cryptocurrencies in your country. After all, ignorantia juris non excusat \u2013 ignorance of the law is no excuse.Still Thinking About Investing in Cryptocurrencies?So what is the takeaway from Ari Paul\u2019s interview? When you distill it down to the basics, it\u2019s really quite simple:There is no \u2018sure thing\u2019 in cryptocurrency investing so investors need to understand and be prepared for the fact that prices are going to fluctuate \u2013 often dramatically;Store your cryptocurrencies securely and \u2013 I can\u2019t stress this enough \u2013 keep your password and private keys stored in a safe, secure location like a fire safe or safety deposit box ;Do your due diligence and make sure you understand the laws and regulations regarding cryptocurrency investing in your country.I would add one more item to the list and it is something that applies to any kind of investing \u2013 don\u2019t invest more than you can afford to lose.Do you agree with Paul\u2019s assessment of cryptocurrency investment risks? Is there anything that you would add to the list? Let us know in the comments below.Images courtesy of AdobeStock, Business Insider, Wikimedia CommonsThe Rundown 1. Investment Risks2.

And one solution, Civil, like PressCoin intends to build a marketplace for content. However none of these innovators have systems that can operate at a news-enterprise level for publishers \u2013 and none establish a new economic foundation to recreate the existing news media economy at a systemic level.

To invest and purchase PressCoin to help the largest ever crowd-funding campaign to address the News Crisis visit the PressCoin ICO page.PressCoin\u2019s Systemic Approach to Addressing the News CrisisPressCoin is an ambitious project to build an alternative global media ecosystem, owned by the people, serving the needs of the people, and built ground up on principles of cooperation, collaboration, and partnership.PressCoin\u2019s business strategy rests on these legs:Shared Design Philosophy \u2013 Open Collaboration, Partnership, and DecentralizationShared Technology Infrastructure \u2013 Seamless media technology cloud, underlying big-data systems, advanced APIs for engagement and analyticsShared Business Services \u2013 Consumer Data Intelligence, Monetization, Enterprise Sales, Ecosystem Partnerships, Strategic RelationsShared Developer Network \u2013 This fertile playground for agile experiments in the news/media/journalism sphereShared Fiat/Crypto Financial Services Infrastructure \u2013 Built on CointypeShared Venture Arm \u2013 Foster disruption within the ecosystemAt a practical level PressCoin plans to dramatically lower the cost of high-quality publishing solutions to enterprise publishers whilst providing them with access to crypto powered markets to share \u2013 on a market basis \u2013 content, traffic and reader data.But now let\u2019s talk about the alternatives.Medium vs. CivilMedium predates all the other journalism enabling initiatives and so it gets to go first. Here\u2019s how Wikipedia describes Medium:Medium is an online publishing platform developed by Evan Williams [one of the founders of Twitter], and launched in August 2012. It is owned by Medium Corporation. The platform is an example of social journalism, having a hybrid collection of amateur and professional people and publications, or exclusive blogs or publishers on Medium, and is regularly regarded as a blog host.Medium is also pretty successful. It\u2019s the 495th ranked website in the world on SimilarWeb. It hosts hundreds of writers and features some very nice UX features. Its revenue model is membership based and members are \u201cempowered\u201d to reward writers. Writers have very limited monetization avenues and a lot utilize crowd-funding systems like Patreon to commercialize their work. PressCoin\u2019s flagship publication Insurge Intelligence, founded by Nafeez Ahmed is presently hosted on Medium.So, what is Civil? At present, it is a work in progress. But it looks as if it will be a blockchain-based decentralized version of Medium, a new place for journalists to ply their trade and possibly earn some money. The big difference between the two is that Civil plans to launch a Cryptocurrency to provide a means for writers to be supported by readers.Both solutions are great as far as they go but neither aspires to provide a systemic solution to the media industry\u2019s revenue woes. In other words both Medium and the soon to be revealed Civil are mostly a consumer product, bordering on the prosumer.Facebook vs. Steemit vs. RedditOf course, we all know what Facebook is, the mother of all content aggregation businesses. Facebook\u2019s goal has been to connect everyone, and with its 2B+ users, it certainly has. And in doing so it has monetized content created by others spectacularly efficiently. Its ubiquitous news feed now earns it a fifth of global digital advertising revenue, in many cases by simply providing a portal to other publisher\u2019s content.And for new publishers, Facebook has become the main avenue to reach readers. Initially it enabled this to happen organically and publishers built up massive reader bases for their Facebook portals, then in January 2015 it decided to charge publishers for distributing content via their own pages, a change which resulted in many publishers having no choice but to double down and to start paying Facebook to reach their own readers.Reddit.com is a lively forum for discussing everything under the sun where you vote others posts up and down. It has a very original world wide web vibe to it and is inclusive, free and fiercely independent.So\u2026 what is Steemit?Think decentralizing the Facebook model, and creating an alternate, blockchain-based Facebook, where everybody gets paid for participating. Like Reddit Steemit\u2019s interface is a popularity contest of sorts for surfacing great content.Steemit is an interesting beast. It launched as an ICO in March 2016 and now has 450,000 accounts, 19 million monthly visits and a bunch of engaged users talking about everything under the sun. Interestingly, \u201cWhere does steemit money come from,\u201d is a commonly googled question, and the answer is difficult to understand. There is no evidence of any business model on the site itself.Shortly after it debuted the Steem currency went to $3 and it\u2019s now nearly back at that level, valuing the market at $1 Billion. And in December Steem Dollars a currency pegged to the US Dollar have spiked to over $20 in value. Quite what is going on with that is hard to understand, and it is far from obvious what lies behind all this wealth beyond a large user base. Notably, it would appear that it is not that easy to join the steemit community at the moment, possibly because of the recent inflation in Steemit Dollars.But who cares, doesn\u2019t everyone benefit?It certainly seems that way, except, for a couple of things. Firstly Steemit doesn\u2019t solve the media industry revenue problems as content from existing content producers is still getting shared on Steemit. For Steemit\u2019s own content producers it is a partial solution, albeit a fairly odd one. The community understandably spends a lot of time discussing itself.Steemit is definitely focused on the individual consumer, or at a stretch the prosumer content creator. And it is definitely not a news-enterprise solution, nor is it meant to be.#FakeNews Media vs WikiTribune vs De CorrespondentWikitribune was founded by Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, in response to a call from the World Wide Web\u2019s inventor Tim Berners Lee to the news crisis.Its Beta was launched in November after a phase of crowdfunding to provide funds to get it established. Its intention is to become a new digital newspaper like platform, with content submitted and edited by a combined force of volunteer and professional editors and reporters. At this stage, it is very much evolving in the spirit of its namesake and actively seeking to enlist and organize an army of volunteers.From a content POV, its point of difference is that it intends to provide source verification for everything it reports. And this would appear to be a very useful approach to take particularly when news events are breaking, and you need a balanced, verified view of the goings-on. They plan to also focus on verified recordings, and incorporate transcriptions into their workflow.So Wikitribune is definitely a great attempt at helping clean up accuracy in one aspect of the journalism industry \u2013 breaking news. And as a news by-the-people-for-the-people resource within the broader journalistic and news media ecosystem, it is an addition that we wholeheartedly support!Wikitribune will be dependent on donations and volunteers to grow. As such it is not providing solutions to the existing global news industry, but rather seeking to provide a safety net for an informed democracy.The Dutch news start-up De-Correspondent \u2013 also established by crowd-funding \u2013 is a reporter\u2019s dream. A publisher built by writers for readers who value quality thoughtful content from subject specialist reporters. Its model is reader/member funded through recurring donations. Its signature feature is facilitated opportunities for informed readers to help shape the news agenda through newsletters inviting direct engagement with reporters. This feature has produced some remarkable Scoop stories and is being closely watched around the world.De-Correspondent\u2019s approach to comments is also unusual. Commenters have to be subscribers, and this appears to result in very thoughtful reader engagement. There is much more to the publication\u2019s well thought out approach that can be explored on the site. The original Dutch language publication \u2013 with some English translations \u2013 will shortly be joined by a New York-based English Language version.In a way, De-Correspondent can be seen as being a structured, writer collective version of Medium from which all of journalism can learn a great deal. PressCoin\u2019s Insurge Intelligence platform team are great admirers of the approach.However, De-Correspondent, like all these other innovative solutions, does not provide a solution to help resolve the immediate revenue crisis facing the existing text-based news industry \u2013 an industry which continues to provide the vast bulk of reliable online news content.For this, here is PressCoin \u201can ambitious project to build an alternative global media ecosystem, owned by the people, serving the needs of the people, and built ground up on principles of cooperation, collaboration, and partnership.\u201dThe PressCoin ICO opened on Monday, Dec. 11. PressCoin is selling $100 mln in NEWS tokens, the largest ever crowdfunding effort to address the news crisis.The Rundown Introduction and SummaryPressCoin\u2019s Systemic Approach to Addressing the News CrisisMedium vs. CivilFacebook vs. Steemit vs. Reddit#FakeNews Media vs WikiTribune vs De Correspondent"}

Facebook is probably home to the largest number of technology challenged people on the planet which makes it such an easy platform to disseminate malware.According to a report in The Independent, security researchers at Trend Micro have discovered malware that infects Facebook messenger in order to surreptitiously mine cryptocurrency. The mining bot, called Digmine, harnesses CPU resources in the background to mine Monero, an anonymous coin which currently trades for around $350.Viral VideoThe malware is disguised in a video file using the name video_xxxx.zip and will appear to come from someone in your contacts list whose machine has already been compromised. It is activated only via the desktop version of Messenger on Google Chrome and does not currently affect mobile versions of the instant chat software.It can give hackers a backdoor into your Facebook account which can then be used to target everyone in your contacts list, spreading the malware even further. According to the cyber security firm:If the user\u2019s Facebook account is set to log in automatically, Digmine will manipulate Facebook Messenger in order to send a link to the file to the account\u2019s friends. The abuse of Facebook is limited to propagation for now, but it wouldn\u2019t be implausible for attackers to hijack the Facebook account itself down the line.Another Facebook Messenger Virus Warning: Digimine https://t.co/0jrOliUBuW pic.twitter.com/BGWkpSeIR6\u2014 HelpProtect.Me (@helpprotectme) December 22, 2017CPU OverloadDigimine primarily installs a cryptocurrency miner called miner.exe which is a modified version of an open source Monero miner known as XMRig. This silently mines the Monero cryptocoin in the background, sending profits to hackers. The bot also installs an auto-start mechanism which launches Chrome with a malicious extension that allows the attackers to access the victims\u2019 Facebook profiles and spread the malicious video file to their friends list via Messenger.Chrome extensions can only be installed via official Chrome Web Store, however, the hackers have bypassed this by launching the browser, along with the malicious extension, via command line.Trend Micro went on to clarify:The extension will read its own configuration from the C&C [command and control] server. It can instruct the extension to either proceed with logging in to Facebook or open a fake page that will play a video. The decoy website that plays the video also serves as part of their C&C structure. This site pretends to be a video streaming site but also holds a lot of the configurations for the malware\u2019s components.Facebook is a hotbed for scams, spam, clickbait, and malware so it pays to be a little more vigilant if you are a heavy social media user.Have you been a victim of the Digimine malware?

A major issue now is how the bank plans on storing the assets, as they will have custodial control of the assets.The bank is also one of the first to support the Bitcoin Futures trading, which has been recently launched by some US exchanges, namely CBOE and the CME Group. Similar scale national banks have held off on clearing those futures, as worries about the volatile nature surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s price along with concerns about the fact that it\u2019s completely unregulated have scared them off.Adoption from Traditional EstablishmentsThis is just one of the many stories in recent weeks about traditional financial systems hopping on the Bitcoin bandwagon. As more and more established firms support the growing crypto-space, the trend is set to continue and bring more institutional investors on board. Support from banks such as Goldman Sachs also gives a layer of legitimacy to Bitcoin, as many people still view it as the currency of \u201cdrug dealers and terrorists.\u201dBlockchain technology, the decentralized ledger system that powers the Bitcoin network, is being looked at by industries worldwide about how to implement the technology to their existing systems. The concept of an immutable, public, and auditable ledger is very attractive to some, especially banks.

Volatility is still a major setback, especially with Bitcoin, which has swung by $8,000 in just seven days.Of banks and cryptocurrency, Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain, told CNBC in an interview last week:This year will be the first year we start to see central banks start to hold digital currencies as part of their balance sheet.Smith stated that central banks would likely buy Bitcoin and Ethereum as part of their reserves, just as they do with gold and foreign currency. The rise of Bitcoin as an asset would mean that some major financial institutions would have to start holding it.Smith went on to say:Bitcoin is already a top 30 currency by supply, and this trend, and pressure to hold digital currency as part of reserves will only accelerate as the price rises.Digital GoldThere is growing opinion among bankers that cryptocurrencies will be held by central banks in order to be better prepared for shocks to the markets. According to Eugene Etsebeth, a former central banker with the South African Reserve Bank:In 2018, G-7 central banks will witness bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies becoming the biggest international currency by market capitalization. This event, together with the global nature of cryptocurrencies with 24/7 trading access, will make it intuitive to own cryptocurrencies as they become a de-facto investment as part of a central bank\u2019s investment tranche.He added that digital currencies would also facilitate international trade.State CoinsIt has also been widely suggested that nations would have to consider issuing their own digital state coins, or stablecoins, which would be pegged to local currency. A number of central banks have already started to investigate the possibility of a state-issued cryptocurrency. Banks in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia announced a partnership to issue a cryptocurrency for cross-border trade last week. The People\u2019s Bank of China also hinted that it would be launching a new state virtual currency in the near future.European Central Bank President Mario Draghi remains skeptical and said cryptocurrencies are not \u201cmature\u201d enough to be considered for regulation yet. He went on to say:With anything that\u2019s new, people have great expectations and also great uncertainty. Right now we think that especially as far as bitcoins and cryptocurrencies are concerned, we don\u2019t think the technology is mature for our consideration.However it is only a matter of time before cryptocurrencies are considered mature enough by bankers and governments alike.Will banks hold crypto next year?

South Korea, which is responsible for as much as 25% of total crypto trading volume, said on Thursday it will impose additional measures to regulate speculation in crypto within the country.South Korea Will Ban Anonymous Crypto TradingAs previously reported that more regulations are expected, South Korean regulators have confirmed additional measures to curb illegal activities at cryptocurrency exchanges. According to Reuters, the government noted that trading prices of most digital currencies were much higher on South Korean exchanges than they were on exchanges in other countries.A government spokesperson made the following statement:The government had warned several times that virtual coins cannot play a role as actual currency and could result in high losses due to excessive volatility.The first steps will include a ban on opening anonymous crypto trading accounts. Most exchanges require photographic proof of identity anyway, so this regulation is nothing to be concerned about.Secondly, however, is a more alarming plan to introduce new legislation which will allow regulators to close virtual coin exchanges if required. This measure had been recommended by the justice ministry, according to the statement.Previously, South Korea had announced a plan to tax capital gains from cryptocurrency trading to tackle what it perceives as the risk of excessive speculation.Banks Backing OffAs expected, earlier this week, two major banks in South Korea announced that they are closing reward programs, which allow clients to purchase bitcoins with credit card bonus points.Commercial banks in the country are increasingly preventing the opening of new virtual accounts, which are necessary to trade on South Korean crypto exchanges.In addition to Shinhan Bank and KB Kookmin Bank closing rewards programs next month, Woori Bank and Korea Development Bank also announced that they would be closing all virtual accounts provided to exchanges.It is no surprise that banks in South Korea and elsewhere are pulling back from crypto; the concept essentially goes against their business model. Unfortunately, in this embryonic industry, traders still need to rely on exchanges, many of which, such as Coinbase, have adopted banking-style models of fees and commissions. Only when crypto trading is truly decentralized and peer-to-peer will the masses start to benefit more than the banks and exchanges.Will the Korean clampdown affect the markets?

Bitcoin and all of its brethren slid overnight by an average of around 12%, and only Ripple seems to have survived.News can be a big influence on the nascent cryptocurrency market, as can social media, such as Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. One such crypto aficionado who has taken to social media in recent weeks to air his views is outspoken British-American computer programmer and businessman John McAfee.Hodl or DieIn an article on MarketWatch, Bitcoin bull McAfee remained confident and told those holding the digital currency to keep doing so, despite it shedding 40% off its record high in the past two weeks. McAfee, who founded the self-named anti-virus company in 1987, took to Twitter, where he has been spending a lot of time lately, and posted:For you who are long term investors like myself: (those who always make the most returns), BITCOIN is still the crypto giant. It is at a low price, and will never be cheaper. It will be ten times this price in 2018. Remember \u2013 it has the lowest circulating supply of any coin.Known his for candid comments, McAfee stated at the end of November that he would eat his own manhood if a Bitcoin was not worth a million dollars by 2020. He has since become quite a character in the crypto sphere.Hacked OffIn an ironic twist, the former cyber security chief found himself at the wrong end of the digital divide today when his Twitter account was hacked. McAfee has been using the account to post daily altcoin recommendations, which have largely resulted in somewhat predictable pumps and dumps. Critics have labelled this as market manipulation, but in an unregulated market such as crypto, anything goes. McAfee recently changed the daily coin recommendation to a weekly occurrence.The hackers had started to post their own coin recommendations using McAfee\u2019s account, which had over half a million followers at the time. Coins pumped during the incursion were BAT, NXT, and Siacoin.He replied with the following post after users started posting screenshots onto social media:Urgent: My account was hacked. Twitter has been notified. The coin of the day tweet was not me. As you all know\u2026 I am not doing a coin of the day anymore!!!!In an attempt to extricate himself from the digital abyss, McAfee did post the following:Though I am a security expert, I have no control over Twitter\u2019s security. I have haters. I am a target. People make fake accounts, fake screenshots, fake claims. I am a target for hackers who lost money and blame me. Please take responsibility for yourselves. Adults only please.What the hack does is highlight the nature of things in crypto land. It will hopefully serve as a warning that nobody, not even the ex-boss of a cyber security firm, is immune.

What could the future hold for these two industries of the future?Esports \u2013 More Than Just \u2018Playing Video Games\u2019Traditionally, video games have always been a popular hobby all around the world, spanning over multiple generations. From the first NES to the current Nintendo Switch, video games have always served as a way for friends and family to bond together and have some fun. Games were designed to be competitive, but not on a large scale; tournaments were usually held between friends, and at best, at events such as PAX Prime.Fast forward a few decades later, and it has evolved into what is known as esports, or competitive video gaming. Even though many remain skeptical of this so-called \u2018sport\u2019, it is becoming harder to ignore when elite players are making multi-million dollar salaries.Just like Bitcoin, the esports industry has experienced a huge spike in popularity over the past year \u2013 the largest tournament this year saw 57 million unique viewers tuning in to watch the championship. Both venture capital firms and NBA veterans are rapidly moving into this billion dollar industry. Teams are paying up to $20 million to compete in regional leagues.With the stakes being this high, could this be a chance for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Projects like DreamTeam and SkinCoin aim to jump in and get a slice of the pie, but some individuals have taken a more drastic approach.From Esports Athlete to Professional Bitcoin TraderA couple of weeks ago, Jeon \u201ciksuu\u201d Ik-soo, a League of Legends player, decided to not renew his contract with his team, Jin Air Green Wings. That wasn\u2019t the extent of it, however; he decided to retire from professional play completely. In a controversial Facebook post, he announced that he had left his team in order to become a full-time Bitcoin investor.To his fans and others in the Bitcoin space, this hasn\u2019t come as much of a surprise \u2013 Bitcoin\u2019s popularity has skyrocketed in South Korea, which has become responsible for over 25% of total cryptocurrency trading volume. The ex-player has even gone as far as streaming his trading activities on Afreeca TV, a popular esports streaming platform for Koreans.

Here\u2019s what\u2019s what you need to know: On December 27, 2017, cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex released this press release. The release outlines that fact that the company will soon start requiring that every account held on its platform is verified and that, to this aim, will start removing accounts (so-called legacy accounts) on an as-yet-undecided date.Here\u2019s Poloniex\u2019s official statement on the development:We have recently completed a major upgrade to our customer identification and verification systems. As a result, we will soon require legacy accounts to become verified through the latest version of our verification portal.What Does This Mean for Account Holders?Anyone that set up an account with Poloniex this year should have no issues. Recently created accounts had to undergo the verification process as part of the initial setup process and \u2013 as such \u2013 already comply with the company\u2019s verification policy.If you set up an account prior to the verification system being put in place, however (and, as a result, are an as-yet unverified account holder), you\u2019re going to need to get the account verified if you don\u2019t want to lose access to it and whatever coins you hold on the platform in that account.The verification process is relatively simple and falls in line with the same sorts of processes being used by the bigger name exchanges in this space (Bittrex, Binance, etc.) and also with the vast majority of the exchanges and financial institutions in the more traditional financial world \u2013 forex exchanges, stock brokerages, that sort of thing.What\u2019s This All About?It\u2019s part of what\u2019s called Know Your Customer (or KYC) legislation, which is a set of rules and processes that dictate how a business needs to identify and verify the identity of its clients. The rules vary from country to country (readers that want some country-specific clarification should check out the Wiki here) but across pretty much every country that employs KYC it basically involves making the customer prove who they say they are by way of a photo identification and address check, that sort of thing.When Will it Go into Effect?As yet, Poloniex hasn\u2019t confirmed the data on which it\u2019s going to shut down the non-verified account. However, as per the PR outlining the news:The exact date for this deadline will be announced in Q1 2018. While you will be given advance notice before this requirement goes into effect, we encourage you to verify your legacy account now to avoid any potential interruptions in your ability to trade on the platform.In other words, if you\u2019ve got an unverified account with Poloniex and you don\u2019t want to risk losing it, it\u2019s best to act as soon as possible.What do you think of this development? Is it an inevitable consequence of scale? Let us know below!Images courtesy of PoloniexThe Rundown What Does This Mean for Account Holders?What\u2019s This All About?When Will it Go into Effect?"}

India, Russia, China, South Korea, Vietnam, and Indonesia have all issued restrictions on exchanges, but one unlikely country in Asia remains open: Thailand.Thailand is a surprise as it is in the grips of a military dictatorship that does not look like it wants to return the country to democracy at any time in the future. With sweeping clampdowns on everything else across the nation, the military seems open towards crypto and are even planning on starting to educate the public about it.Coin SchoolIt was reported in the Bangkok Post that the Finance Ministry will join with other authorities to educate people about Bitcoin following the digital asset\u2019s wild ride this month. The concern is that people need to be made aware of the risks of what it describes as \u2018Ponzi scheme\u2019 types of trading before pouring their money into unregulated cryptos.The Bank of Thailand, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) also took part in the meeting, which came after junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha expressed concern about rapidly rising prices.No RegulationThe Bank of Thailand governor raised a warning flag on cryptocurrencies last week, stating they are not legal tender. More importantly, the central bank has declined to regulate cryptocurrencies as their usage is not so widespread that they could cause systematic risks for Thailand, according to the report.The bank\u2019s governor went on to state that:There is no central bank in the world that accepts Bitcoin, and central banks in the US and Japan are open to opportunities for virtual currencies to be used for payments if recipients are ready to accept them.Warnings from central banks in Singapore and Japan have been issued in recent weeks, but there has been no new legislation there either. South Korea, on the other hand, has issued tighter regulations for exchanges that helped spark a short-lived crypto selloff yesterday.Cryptocurrencies in Thailand are traded on the country\u2019s only exchange, BX.in.th, which offers a number of digital currencies that can be bought directly with fiat. These digital currencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ripple, Dash, and OmiseGO. According to Coinmarketcap, BX Thailand is the 56th most popular exchange globally, with $18 million traded in the past 24 hours.Will Asian nations remain open to crypto like Thailand, or are they all likely to clamp down?

Everybody was talking about growing bubble, everybody was trying to predict the dates and levels, but as usual, it has come up unexpectedly. Or not? Below I will name the key drivers that triggered the move and the possible scenario for most cryptocurrencies under the leadership of Bitcoin.The current Bitcoin slump is the function of mass profit taking. During the recent months, the speculative demand sped up the cryptocurrency\u2019s growth pushing the prices up 200%-500% higher. Everybody knew it was a bubble but still kept buying up till the moment when some key figures of the crypto world came out with an official warning. And this became the start of new era for Bitcoin and Co.An Interesting Chronology of EventsDecember, 19 \u2013 Emil Oldenburg, the Co-founder and CTO of bitcoin.com, one of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin websites, has sold his bitcoins saying that others will do the same when they realize how illiquid the market is.December, 20 \u2013 the San Francisco-based software engineer, whose Litecoin was founded in 2011 \u201csold and donated\u201d all of his holdings over the past few days, saying he aimed at preventing a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d.Coincidence? Don\u2019t Think So\u2026These are big players, and they are also opinion leaders. Their steps and words have a significant impact on the market. And their decision to leave the market scared off some of the investors. The most cautious decided to take profit, thus triggering the domino effect. The sell-off was moderate during the first days, only gathering the pace by the weekend. For now, most digital currencies have already lost about 30%-50% of the recent bearish move, and it means the slide will be coming to an end in the nearest future.Just because all bubbles looks the same. And all investors act the same during the bubble burst. Let\u2019s look at a quite famous picture of the behavioral patterns during the bubble blowing and bursting.The famous \u201cDot-Com\u201d Bubble perfectly follows the above-mentioned stages:And now let\u2019s look at Bitcoin chart:Doesn\u2019t it look like we are in a \u201creturn to normal\u201d phase? And right now we are close to a \u201cbull trap\u201d meaning that the correction is here but it will cover only 30%-50% of the recent sell-off.For Bitcoin it may mean the return to $17,000, but soon after we will see another round of sell-off to the levels around $5,000. So, if you are on the buy side suffering loses \u2013 you still have a chance for recovery. But don\u2019t be too greedy \u2013 the growth phase will have limited nature.

Investors are at the mercy of high fees and low liquidity and, with transparency still lacking, even third-party verification suffers from conflicts of interest. trade.io aims to disrupt the current financial establishment and lead it forwards with honest and fair trading, conducted and recorded on the secure and transparent blockchain.trade.io\u2019s one-of-a-kind trading and financing platform goes beyond cryptocurrency assets, also offering Forex and CFDs over precious metals, oil, commodities, indices, and global equities. At launch, they plan to feature more than 120 products on their platform.The Trade Token and ICOIn order to facilitate a new trading platform, trade.io will introduce the Trade Token (TIO), a utility token that enables transactions of a wide range of assets, which also acts as a medium of exchange and as a store of value.One of the main benefits that trade.io will be offering investors is access to what they are calling the liquidity pool, where owners will be given the opportunity to contribute an amount of their stored assets to a P2P liquidity pool. From this pool, 50% of the daily revenue generated by trade.io will be paid to owners in the pool although a minimum of 2500 Trade Tokens will be required to qualify for this benefit.Trade.io will be issuing 500 million Trade Tokens, of which approximately two thirds will be made available for the crowdsale. Their ICO will run from the December 7th until the 4th of January 2018, and any unsold tokens will be destroyed at the end of the crowdsale.Allocation of the tokens will be in the following areas;23% for acquisitions and IP\u2019s,20% for licenses,20% for operations,18% for the liquidity pool,7% for development,9% for seed and venture fund,3% reserved for legal, audits and advisory purposes.trade.io has completed their pre-ICO successfully, raising over $11.3M from over 4,000 participants. According to icoscanner.io, trade.io is currently the 5th most successful ICO in Ethereum contributions.trade.io\u2019s Experience and Partnershipstrade.io\u2019s team have over 20 years of experience in trading, investment banking, compliance and risk management. They have formed strategic partnerships with a number of companies in the cryptocurrency and blockchain spaces, including:Civic, whose technology will be used for identification and verification purposes;MODULAR, whose new Biosym framework decreases ICO processes by 85% on the Ethereum Network;HitBTC, the London based exchange has agreed to accept trade.io Trade Tokens. trade.io will announce shortly when the Trade Token (TIO) will start trading. TIO will have trading pairs with Bitcoin and Ethereum;Bancor, whose protocol will allow trade.io users to convert Trade Tokens (TIO) to any other ERC20 token.Paul Clarkson, CPO of HitBTC had the following to say:\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that HitBTC is extremely selective in the tokens & coins we list, we have strict criteria and require an extensive amount of due diligence prior to extending an offer. trade.io has proven to be a trusted partner and we are pleased to list TIO, and start a long-term relationship.\u201dAs well as partnering with other high profile and innovative companies, trade.io also purchased the US regulated broker-dealer (BD) in an effort to focus on US regulatory compliance.William Heyn, trade.io\u2019s VP of Capital Markets, explained:Being able to conduct trade.io\u2019s business in the United States in a regulatory compliant manner is critical. The broker/dealer will afford us with tremendous opportunities and unlock many sources of revenue potential.One of the newest partnerships forged by trade.io is that with Bancor. By integrating the Bancor protocol with their own platform, trade.io users will be able to convert their TIO tokens to any other ERC20 token in the Bancor network at an automatically calculated price. Of the new partnership, trade.io CEO Jim Preissler commented:We continue to deliver to the trade.io community unique value-added propositions, and see this relationship with Bancor as a further example. We already have generated a large demand for our community and it\u2019s only logical to provide a simple way to convert tokens.Investment in Education and the Future of Blockchaintrade.io recently announced that they had funded two post-doctoral seats at the University of Nicosia with a specific focus on advanced research into Distributed Ledger Technology. Research will help develop and implement future updates regarding side-chains and cross-chain interoperability, as well as smart token corporate governance in an effort to develop best practices and implementations.Preissler spoke with Bitcoinist about the company\u2019s educational support at the University of Nicosia:This is a major development for us, it provides trade.io with access to some of the brightest and most innovative minds in blockchain and digital currency. The University of Nicosia has embraced blockchain technology since 2013, they were the first university in the world to offer coursework and an accredited academic degree program in this field (MSc in Digital Currency) and are considered a global leader in academia in this area.To learn more about trade.io please visit the company website.

Additionally, Schnorr signatures could help protect Bitcoin from certain types of spam attacks.Schnorr Signatures Could Solve Bitcoin\u2019s Scalability ProblemAn array of new technologies and schemes are being proposed that could help address Bitcoin\u2019s scalability problem, such as Segwit, Lightning Network, and Schnorr signatures.For example, many view the Schnorr signatures algorithm as a simple way of structuring digital signatures that could significantly improve the efficiency of validating a Bitcoin transaction, and it could offer new multi-signature (multisig) modes.In this regard, Sam Wouters, Bitcoin and Blockchain speaker, wrote an article entitled Why Schnorr Signatures Will Help Solve Two of Bitcoin\u2019s Biggest Problems Today. In it, he explains how the Schnorr signatures protocol could help solve Bitcoin\u2019s scalability problem and how it could defend Bitcoin from certain types of spam attacks.Wouters wrote this article in July 2017. Now, however, the article is gaining renewed traction on social media.Valid Bitcoin transactions require signatures. These signatures occupy critical block space. This situation deteriorates when multiple addresses are involved in a transaction because each address needs its own signature. As a result, transaction size requirements increases, which in turn pushes transaction fees higher.A potential solution would be implementing the Schnorr signatures algorithm. Wouters writes:At the end of the day, if it is just one person sending that transaction from multiple sources, there should be some way to do so with just one signature, right? This is what Schnorr signatures allow us to do.Wouters estimates that \u201cthis upgrade would reduce the use of storage and bandwidth by at least 25%. To point out the obvious: that is a huge efficiency gain.\u201dSchnorr Signatures to Shield Bitcoin against Spam AttackersSchnorr signatures could also help prevent certain types spam attacks, such as those in which the attacker sends transactions that include multiple signatures. The attacker achieves this spam attack by repeatedly sending transactions from several sources. In this regard, Wouters writes:Fortunately for us, Schnorr signatures would help combat this kind of spam attack. If we only have one signature per transaction, more transactions will fit into blocks and a spammer would need to send far more transactions in competition with more people, and thus likely spend more money to take up the same transaction space.Advantages of Schnorr SignaturesThe Schnorr signatures algorithm is compatible with multi-signatures (multsig). This functionality allows compiling several digital signatures into one signature. An article entitled Technology Roadmap \u2013 Schnorr Signatures and Signature Aggregation, points out some of the advantages of Schnorr signatures:Constant-size signatures irrespective of the number of participants in the multisig setup.The diminished size of data to be validated and transmitted across the network also translates into interesting capacity gains.From a privacy standpoint, Schnorr allows the entire policy of the multisig to be obscured and indistinguishable from a conventional single pubkey.The properties of Schnorr allowing for the combination of multiple signatures over a single input are also applicable to the aggregation of multiple inputs for all transactions.Moreover, during a presentation at Scaling Bitcoin 2016 Milan, Pieter Wuille summarized several of Schnorr signatures advantages, as shown in the slide below:Cryptocurrency enthusiasts agree that Bitcoin must soon solve its problems with scalability and high transaction fees. Therefore, proposals that could address these issues, such as Schnorr signatures, should undergo careful review. Promising proposals should then receive support from all stakeholders to move forward.What do you think would be the impact on Bitcoin if Schnorr signatures replace Bitcoins\u2019 signature digital algorithm, ECDSA?Images courtesy of Pixabay, Sam WoutersThe Rundown Schnorr Signatures Could Solve Bitcoin\u2019s Scalability ProblemSchnorr Signatures to Shield Bitcoin against Spam AttackersAdvantages of Schnorr Signatures"}

He has just been freed after paying a ransom of over $1 million in bitcoins.Many media reports came out this week concerning the news that Pavel Lerner, Managing Director at bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Exmo, had been kidnapped. After a few days of speculation, we can now report that Lerner is alive and unharmed. He was freed from his kidnappers after paying a $1 million ransom in bitcoins.According to the BBC, Lerner was leaving his office in Kiev on December 26th when he was bundled into a vehicle (reportedly a black Mercedes) by a group of men wearing balaclavas. An active search was undertaken by the Kiev police, but very little information was uncovered about the kidnapping.Initial Motive Was UnclearThe initial motive behind the kidnapping remained unclear, but it was assumed that it was rooted in his position at Exmo and \u2013 in turn \u2013 the perception that he has some sort of access to the company\u2019s store of client funds.Exmo has been quick to point out that this isn\u2019t the case. The BBC report that Lerner is listed as an Analytics Manager at the exchange, while Pavel\u2019s Facebook page lists him as Managing Director, based out of Barcelona, Spain.To make things worse, Exmo also became the target of a DDOS attack, which it is reportedly working to resolve (as reported on Twitter):EXMO is under the DDoS attack.The site will be available within half an hour.We apologize for the temporary inconvenience.Sincerely, The EXMO Team\u2014 EXMO (@Exmo_com) December 28, 2017All signs suggest that this DDOS attack is now sorted, with the company\u2019s website up and (seemingly) running smoothly.Pavel Lerner ReleasedAfter several days of worry and fear, there is some good news. It has just been reported that Pavel Lerner has been released. The kidnappers let him go after he paid a ransom of over $1 million in bitcoins. Authorities state that Lerner is in a state of shock and that he is very lucky to be alive. Bitcoinist would like to extend our best wishes to Lerner for a full and speedy recovery from his ordeal.Exmo has just released a statement on Lerner\u2019s kidnapping case:On December 26, Pavel was captured by a group of unknown masked people, and all the connection with him ceased for several days. On December 29, we managed to get a hold of Pavel. At the moment, he is safe, and there was no physical harm inflicted on him. Nevertheless, Pavel is currently in a state of major stress, therefore, he will not provide any official comments in the coming days.The case is currently under investigation of the state security authorities.Exactly what impact this will have on the exchange and the wider cryptocurrency space remains to be seen. The fact that kidnappers know that they can get a fat ransom for kidnapping exchange executives is very troubling. One wonders if we will see further kidnapping attempts take place in the future.Does this kidnapping open doors to future criminal attacks? Are you an Exmo client? If so, let us know your thoughts on the situation below.Images courtesy of Flickr/Vladimir Kud, Twitter/@Exmo_com, Facebook/Pavel Lerner, and Pixabay.The Rundown Initial Motive Was UnclearPavel Lerner Released"}

This is a big deal. But why? Is Ripple a good investment? Will banks adopt it? Let\u2019s find out.Why Is Ripple Causing Waves?While Bitcoin and the rest of the top 10 cryptocurrencies are well below their peak, Ripple is enjoying a meteoric rise and is trading at $ 2.22, up more than 49% from this time yesterday. In fact, it just unseated Ethereum as the #2 cryptocurrency in terms of market cap. So why is Ripple\u2019s current so strong?6 Reasons Why Ripple\u2019s Tide is RisingThere are a number of factors that could be contributing to the sudden rise in Ripple\u2019s price, but here are the six most likely reasons:Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse\u2019s appearance on CNBC to explain to a mainstream investment audience the advantages of Ripple over the current system. His example of outrageous cross-border ATM fees and the amount of time it takes to send money from New York to London resonated with a financially savvy audience. It also helps that Garlinghouse looks and sounds like a Wall Street insider.Most cryptocurrency transaction fees are high and burdensome, while Ripple\u2019s are some of the lowest available. Ripple claims banks can save an average of $3.76 per payment using their network. If you\u2019re going to use cryptocurrency for international payments, there isn\u2019t a real competitor to Ripple.Ethereum and Bitcoin are the dialups of cryptocurrency. A transaction can sometimes take up to 30 \u2013 40 minutes to clear with ETH and an hour or more with BTC, whereas it takes only seconds with Ripple\u2019s XRP. Amid that aggravation, Ripple\u2019s daily transaction volume has soared from 150,000 to more than 1,050,000 in the last few weeks.Asia\u2019s role in the run-up cannot be understated. Last year Ripple partnered with SBI Holdings to launch SBI Ripple Asia which is a dedicated sales and engineering venture to serve countries like Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan. The Ripple Asia tests begin next quarter so I believe there is some built in anticipation.American Express\u2019 adoption of Ripple is helping to legitimize the cryptocurrency because it will offer its millions of users\u2019 instant block-chain based payments.Rumors that Coinbase will soon support Ripple may be adding to the runup. For perspective, look at what happened when Bitcoin Cash was added to the largest Crypto Platform. If you would have told me 3 months ago that Ripple would surpass Ethereum in market cap by the end of 2017, I would have had a long laugh at your expense. But clearly, the joke is on me.But not everyone is convinced. Take this tweet from Ryan Selkis who claims he knows of no banks that are using it or plan to use it.Buyer beware!Per a source at one of the major banks re XRP:\"I know of no banks that are a) using it, or b) would touch it in any way as it is controlled by a SV company and 20% of all XRP in existence were taken by the founders.\u2014 Ryan Selkis (@twobitidiot) December 29, 2017So what do you think?

This has had significant impact, but a crypto expert has come forward and suggested that UK firms could start their own ICOs to overcome this investment slowdown.Uncertainty Clouds the IssueIf there\u2019s one thing that businesspeople hate, it\u2019s uncertainty. Companies want to make decisions based on hard data, and plans are laid out in advance that take in every possible criteria that could have an impact. (At least the smart companies operate in this fashion.)The lingering malaise over Brexit is having a chilling effect on investments made into UK companies. After all, who wants to pour their money into a company when the rules could suddenly change a few months down the road?Przemek Skwirczynski, an associate at ICO Rocket, has a solution to this dilemma. He believes UK companies should tap into the wealth created by the Bitcoin boom by having ICOs of their own. He says:Cryptocurrencies offer companies a chance to overcome the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit deal and continue to receive investment. Currently this is small scale but as you see the interest in ICOs picking up I am hoping this will become a very mainstream way of financing.Are ICOs the Answer?It should be pointed out that Skwirczynski has a vested interest in promoting ICOs. The company he\u2019s attached to, ICO Rocket, specializes in helping businesses that are not well-versed in the crypto world to prepare and run an ICO.He goes on to say:Effectively a company will be issuing their own coin and then people will be investing in that and typically this kind of coin will have a higher rate of growth in terms of its value than the more established ones, like Bitcoin or Ethereum \u2026 It is effectively spreading the wealth that has been created by the appreciation of Bitcoin or Ethereum \u2026 This is a very positive outcome of this kind of this whole boom.Skwirczynski says ICOs could allow consumers to back individual projects that they support. An example of such support is helping a movie get financed, where he then goes to add:I don\u2019t see why this could not be applied to the film industry where you can create a coin for a movie production and then have a film being financed in that way and that will be very useful for the industry and the viewers \u2026 At the moment film production is really dominated by an oligopoly on a worldwide scale \u2026 Doing this kind of disruptive activity where you are breaking up the oligopoly that have got to have a positive effect for pretty much everyone.There are some pros and cons to UK companies launching ICOs to drum up investment funds. On the pro side, ICOs can be quite successful. SingularityNET raised $36 million during their ICO, which lasted all of a single minute before the capped amount was reached. Allowing ICOs within a country is an investment lure, which is something that the country of Belarus fully understands. Belarus recently signed into law that revenue and profits gained from crypto-based activities will be tax-free until 2023.The cons to UK firms launching ICOs include ongoing regulatory attempts and shareholders. Most companies that have an ICO are firmly entrenched into the crypto world. Their platforms are designed from the ground up to take advantage of the blockchain and the ability to use tokens. However, most standard companies are not. Will current shareholders be enthused about a bunch of crypto enthusiasts coming on board? What structure would be put into place to offer rewards to token holders and to shareholders? Would token holders get a vote? A dual system would emerge, shares and cryptocurrency, that may or may not work well together.Plus, the UK is still working on how best to regulate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The government is concerned people are using crypto to launder money or evade paying taxes. Again, this is more uncertainty.Overall, the idea of using ICOs to counteract Brexit investment slowdown is an intriguing one, and it could work. The trick is figuring out all the details in implementing them for existing businesses and making sure shareholders are appeased.Do you think having UK companies launching ICOs are an effective means to counteract the investment slowdown caused by Brexit?

Such doubters point to the crypto\u2019s ongoing volatility and the number of major drops in value over the last year. However, tech investor Roger McNamee believes that the upcoming year could be a turning point for Bitcoin. In fact, he believes it\u2019s quite possible that Bitcoin could become fully legitimate in the eyes of the business world.2018 Could Make or Break BitcoinIn an interview on CNBC, McNamee said that Bitcoin could be considered legit if is withstands a crash and sees enough gains in 2018. He elaborated by saying:[Bitcoin is] still a very small market in the context of the larger financial world, but it has had a huge year. We\u2019ve done it around a speculative mania. If a mania goes on long enough, it becomes self-fulfilling. Even after a crash, what follows is a legitimate industry.McNamee goes on to say that the cryptocurrency needs to keep investors on their toes and has to stick around long enough to become accepted. He adds:With the amount of activity going on around it, there are people willing to invest the kind of dollars it takes to make a thing like bitcoin into a long-term part of the financial market.A Proven Track RecordRoger McNamee has proven to have great instincts. He was an early investor in Facebook and told Mark Zuckerberg that he should not sell the company back when it received a major offer of $750 million. Bill Gates considers McNamee a \u201cgreat sounding board\u201d for many of the Microsoft co-founder\u2019s ideas. Then there\u2019s the fact that he made venture capital investments in a small game company by the name of Electronic Arts, which is now the second-largest game company in Europe and the Americas.Roger McNamee is also a musician in addition to being a tech investor.As for Bitcoin, McNamee thinks that the cryptocurrency is still too new for many investors to understand. However, he thinks 2018 will open some eyes on how Bitcoin could play a role in the financial markets. Looking ahead to the new year and Bitcoin, he says:You\u2019ll have these big swings, up and presumably down, as well. And, you know, wherever that settles out I think will tell us a lot about the role of bitcoin long-term.Overall, McNamee also thinks that, no matter how the year treats Bitcoin, it won\u2019t be the end of the story for the virtual currency. It is refreshing to hear someone express pragmatic optimism on how Bitcoin could break through those final trust barriers that the financial world has erected. He fully understands that there are going to be ups and downs, but what is important is that Bitcoin continues to stick around and shows staying power.Do you agree with Roger McNamee that 2018 could be a decisive year for Bitcoin?

The Rise of Blockchain Technology in Messaging AppsThere is no doubt that 2017 was the year of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, skyrocketed in value over the course of the year, and many governments and businesses started to realize the potential of the blockchain. To that end, a vast amount of companies have decided to experiment, or even fully implement, blockchain technology into their services and platforms.As blockchain technology is rapidly gaining more support worldwide, many messaging apps have decided to experiment with it. A good example for this is the Kin project that was launched by the popular Kik mobile messaging app. The Kin ICO was able to raise over $97 million through its ICO. Kik is planning to integrate the Kin cryptocurrency into its messaging ecosystem and offer various decentralized services. However, Kik isn\u2019t the only messaging platform that is focusing on blockchain technology. Several sources have said that Telegram is also planning to launch their own blockchain network.Telegram Launching Their Own Blockchain NetworkA recent news report by International Business Times announced that the popular messaging app Telegram is planning to get into the blockchain game. Anton Rozenberg, a former employee of Telegraph, Telegram\u2019s publishing division, posted a video that described Telegram\u2019s new blockchain platform. According to the video, the new blockchain network will be called the Telegram Open Network.The blockchain platform is aiming to allow Telegram users to instantly and cheaply use cryptocurrency worldwide. It is believed that the cryptocurrency will allow people that live in countries with oppressive governments to bypass harsh regulations and sanctions and be able to pay for international services and goods. Analysts think that Telegram may announce its own Initial Coin Offering in order to fund the proper development for its new blockchain platform. Experts also believe that the new network will allow Telegram to implement a monetization route for its service.On Rozenberg\u2019s Facebook page, he says (translated):On the one hand, this assumption seems logical. In the sense that pavel durov loves hype and really could think it\u2019s a good way to simultaneously himself and raise money to maintain telegram. And given his promises not to sell messenger, it is a more or less the only way not to break the word (if not trying to collect donations like Wikipedia).He also adds (translated):According to the same rumor, the idea of the idea was to release its cryptocurrency, to embed it in the messenger and to announce the largest number of users of the system by trying to drive the etherium out. And today I got confirmation that these rumors had all the bases: the project will be called ton (telegram open network), and there is already a beautiful ad in star wars, really, without any specifics.However, it should be pointed out that there is no official word from Telegram about this new blockchain network and cryptocurrency.What are your thoughts on this potential new blockchain network? Do you think that Telegram users will benefit from it?

Massive price increases, mainstream adoption and just an overall interest in the benefits of blockchain technology have been some of the key highlights of this year.It\u2019s not just investors hoping to capitalize on these benefits though, governments can also see the advantages to having a cashless financial system.Bragging Rights for the First State-Run ICOEstonia had previously announced its plan to develop its own cryptocurrency, the Estcoin. In addition, the country has plans to launch an ICO for its crypto. If successful, it will be the world\u2019s first state-approved and supported ICO.According to Futurism, the Estcoin would support the country\u2019s e-Residency initiative, which is a project aimed at creating and fostering a global digital nation. Kaspar Korjus, who is the program\u2019s managing director, explained that essentially, anyone in the world who has Internet access can become a \u201cdigital citizen\u201d of Estonia. In addition, these citizens can set up and run their business in the country.Since its launch, the e-Residency initiative has received over 27,000 applicants from more than 140 countries. In addition, 4,272 companies have been registered.A Multi-Faceted TokenAccording to Korjus, the state-operated Estcoin token would have varied uses. He explained:The community Estcoin would be structured to support the objective of growing our new digital nation by incentivizing more people around the world to apply for and make greater use of e-Residency. This includes encouraging investors and entrepreneurs to use e-Residency as their platform for trusted ICO activity.These tokens, which cannot be traded, can also be used to facilitate electronic signatures, and for log-in purposes. Even though its value will be connected to that of the euro, it is by no means a substitute for the country\u2019s fiat currency.Vitalik Buterin, who is the co-founder of Ethereum, gave his opinion on the matter:[I]f these estcoins are issued on top of a blockchain (they could possibly be issued in multiple formats at the same time, nothing wrong with this) then it would become easy and convenient to use them inside of smart contracts and other applications.Estcoin Is Part of the Bigger PictureEven though countries such as Russia, Israel, and Dubai have plans to launch their own state-controlled digital currencies, Estonia seems to have a clear picture in mind, not just in creating a useful crypto, but incorporating it into a new era in the digital revolution.Do you think Estonia will succeed in creating a digital nation?

Maybe we will look back on it in years to come and see 2017 as the genesis of a new way of blending business and technology. 2017 could be seen for crypto as 1995 was for the internet, when things really started to take off. Bitcoin has been around since 2009, although, for many years, it has been seen as largely a geeky thing to mine and invest in. The king of crypto has only hit the mainstream in the last few months, but it has cemented its place there.Bitcoin and its various forks aside, this piece will focus on the altcoins which most of us hadn\u2019t even heard of at the beginning of the year. There has been a digital explosion in ICOs in the past six months, with blockchain companies mushrooming out of nowhere and conjuring up solutions to real world issues. Some coins are just that, virtual currencies, but some try to break the Bitcoin mold of digital money and offer innovative new technology for data management and distributed ledger applications.Ether RisingEthereum has to be right up there with game-changing cryptos for the past year. The decentralized application platform has jumped from relative obscurity in January, trading at $10, to a whopping $700 today. The 7000% increase in Ether this year has secured it the second highest crypto currency by market capitalization with $70 billion for most of the year. Big things could be in store for ETH in 2018 when the platform is upgraded, scaling issues are solved, and more applications start using it.Another coin that has made big moves in 2017 is Ripple. Many traders are skeptical about this one due to its close ties with traditional financial institutions and banks. However, these connections have just propelled the altcoin to second spot in the market capitalization charts. XRP was pretty much unknown at the beginning of the year, trading at $0.006, but it has since skyrocketed to over $2.50, where it currently trades due to a number of deals with major banks and credit card companies. The XRP blockchain will be used as a faster, more secure, and efficient way of inter-bank transfers. If it becomes the standard for such transfers, that price is sure to continue upwards.Litecoin LiftedAnother one of 2017\u2019s champions is Litecoin, which is often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold. LTC has made epic moves on the tail of its big brother, trading around $4 in January to over $240 today. Compare this 6000% rise to Bitcoin\u2019s 1500% and it is clear that the altcoins have made bigger moves. With an improved blockchain affording faster and cheaper transactions, Litecoin is destined for greater acceptance in 2018, which will no doubt send that price higher than the record $375 it reached earlier this month.Dash has also had a very good year, starting out at around ten bucks in January, and motoring to dizzying heights of $1,500 in mid-December before pulling back to around a thousand. The popularity of Dash arises from its security and privacy, and anonymous coins will be in increasing demand throughout 2018. Dash could go higher in the new year, as could similar cryptos, such as Monero, Zcash, Zcoin, and Verge, who are all heavily weighted towards privacy.There are too many altcoins to list in total, and nearly all of them have increased in value exponentially since the beginning of 2017. Some are destined for greater things in the coming year. Keep an eye on Iota, Cardano, Neo, Nem, Stella, Qtum, Lisk, and OmiseGO. Invest wisely and always do your own research.[Full disclosure: The author of this article is a holder of multiple altcoins.]Will you be increasing your altcoin portfolio in 2018?

The decentralized nature of cryptos certainly has a tradeoff \u2013 unlike a credit card or bank transaction that can be reverted, a cryptocurrency transfer once confirmed is permanently recorded on the Blockchain. This is where multi-signature (multisig) wallets come to our rescue.A multisig wallet is a special bitcoin wallet that requires more than one private key to sign transactions. Most multi-signature setups usually involve three parties \u2013 the sender of the payment, the recipient, and an escrow agent. Each of the three parties holds one private key, and to send any transaction, at least two private keys must be used.Typically, escrow agents are trusted members of the Bitcoin community or registered entities who arbitrate any disputes that may arise. Therefore, the buyer is protected in case the seller turns out to be fraudulent, and the seller, too, is assured of payment even if the buyer refuses to pay.Creating a Multisig WalletThere are many ways to create a multisig wallet. In fact, most Bitcoin clients support the multisig protocol. Electrum and Armoury are used by many crypto holders because they have provisions for advanced settings like custom fees etc. which are great for power users. BitGo is another popular option for those who prefer a web-based client. In my opinion, however, CoPay offers the most streamlined, easy to use interface, that is usable by anyone, even a new Bitcoin user. So for the purposes of this tutorial, I will be usingStep 1: Download CoPayHead over to the CoPay website and download the appropriate installer for your platform. A great advantage of using CoPay is its support for nearly all desktop and mobile platforms (iOS and Android included).Step 2: Start by setting up your personal walletOpen the installed app, and run through the quick setup to create your personal wallet. This will involve typing in an email address for transaction notifications, and noting down a mnemonic phrase that can be used as a backup in case CoPay is accidentally deleted from your computer.The first few screens will help you create your CoPay Personal Wallet.Step 3: Create a Shared WalletMultisig wallets are called \u2018Shared Wallets\u2019 in CoPay. Once your personal wallet is set up, click on the shared wallet option on the CoPay home screen to create a multisig wallet. You will be presented with a screen where you can configure the wallet with the number of co-payers, the number of signatures required etc. depending on your needs.You can customize your CoPay Wallet based on your needs.Step 4: Share the CoPay invite with othersThe last step is to share your multisig wallet with the 2 other parties. Send them the CoPay code displayed or ask them to scan the QR code. That\u2019s it! Your CoPay escrow is set up! Now everytime someone requests a payment, you will receive a notification to confirm the transaction.Have you ever used a multisig wallet before?

Mark Fidelman | Dec 30, 2017 | 17:00 Share Tweet Send Share EOS hype is off the chart, but does the company have the capacity to outperform Ethereum? We answer that question and several more as we do a deep dive into the company, its management, and its business model.It\u2019s easy to proclaim the latest technology the next internet, [insert crypto] killer, or even the next generation blockchain. But will it hold up to the hype?That is the question EOS is about to answer.To understand EOS, think of it as an IBM PC running Linux to Ethereum\u2019s Commodore 64. The former being faster, more scalable and able to accommodate a wider variety of applications. That\u2019s not a knock on Ethereum as the Commodore 64 has outsold every computer in history, but it does speak to the Ethereum\u2019s current capabilities.If you ask EOS founder Dan Larimer, the biggest obstacle to widespread Ethereum adoption is the speed and scalability of the platform. But can\u2019t Ethereum solve those issues and snuff out EOS in the long term? Larimer believes there is room for both, and several others as well.But the reality is \u2013 the war is on.It\u2019s being fought in the crypto community, with crypto platform developers, and in the media.To some it\u2019s personal. Several people have come out publicly to accuse Larimer of developing a series of Ponzi schemes and that EOS is just the latest.Larrimer is no stranger to blockchain technologies, he\u2019s built two and understands their limitations. Which is why he built EOS. Dismissing someone who has built two blockchains because some feel they aren\u2019t legitimate isn\u2019t a sound argument.But even if EOS is superior and developers adopt it \u2013 it doesn\u2019t mean it will win. EOS will need a \u2018Crypto Kitty\u2018 moment to truly test and legitimize the platform as a potential Ethereum competitor.Why EOS Could Unseat EthereumOn paper, EOS promises to perform better and will incorporate the delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus protocol which is basically a democratized voting system except those with the most tokens have the most votes. The system is decentralized, exceedingly fast and uses far less energy. EOS claims it will be able to process millions of transactions per second compared to Ethereum\u2019s 15 and Visa\u2019s 45,000 per second.Even better, EOS promises there will be no user fees on its blockchain \u2013 another key differentiator that could help them gain wider adoption than Ethereum\u2019s toll model. Scalable blockchain that is free (like the internet that doesn\u2019t charge for usage) will win the day.The real test of EOS is its decentralized operating system. Will the promise that developers can build applications on EOS with EOS coins as a claim on its server resources versus a toll model be realized? Apparently, a developer need only possess and not spend EOS coins to use the EOS blockchain and server resources.Back to the IBM PC/Linux analogy, the EOS developers and community control the platform, the more vested you are, the more influence you have. The platform is free, resources and libraries are shared and theoretically, developers will churn out applications that are faster, cheaper and better than anything you can produce on Ethereum.So is EOS a Winner or Loser?Currently, EOS is trading at $8.69 and its market cap is $4.9 billion. This puts EOS.io at number 12 out of all cryptocurrency market capitalizations.The market believes it will be a winner, but it\u2019s not yet convinced that it will supplant Ethereum as the preferred decentralized application platform.Currently, there are several developers testing the EOS Dawn 2.0 platform but I have yet to see any confirmed success stories. It\u2019s still early, but this is a critical milestone that will give potential EOS coin holders additional confidence in the platform.True, Ethereum has a first mover\u2019s advantage, but like fellow first movers MySpace, Atari, and Netscape, all had early success and led their markets until they were unseated by superior, generation 2 competitors. Moreover, EOS\u2019 trajectory is closing in on Ethereum\u2019s and is currently trading over $600 billion in volume a day. That\u2019s not a micro-competitor.In regard to leadership, EOS\u2019s Larimer has a track record of leaving the company before it\u2019s time, but that track record also includes Steem and Bitshares whose market cap is higher than 98% of the rest of the traded coins.But from my research, I don\u2019t have a clear picture of how the revenue model is going to succeed, so there are still some big question marks that need to be answered here.So, my short-term advice is that since EOS is still a speculative investment, invest like a venture capitalist. Take a reasonable position to start \u2013 enough to keep you interested in following the company, then increase the investment in a series of rounds once milestones are reached.In the long-term, it\u2019s important to understand EOS\u2019s intrinsic value (unknown) versus their market value ($4.7 billion) because eventually, they will meet. At this stage, I am willing to bet the difference is vast and thus EOS is not something you want to hodl.Here is my EOS scorecard:ManagementB+Market SizeA+Go to market StrategyAProduct validationNoneScalableABusiness modelCDifferentiated productBQuick summary: invest a small amount in the short term, then increase or decrease your investment as key milestones are reached.**For informational use only.

The tokens of the nascent cryptobank, which went on sale on October 31, were an immediate smash hit with buyers, hitting the company\u2019s soft cap in a mere five hours.Even more interesting was the widespread distribution of the sales \u2013 buyers flocked in from 143 countries all over the world. The largest purchases came from the United States and Russia, but countries such as the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Turkey, Japan and the UK were also notably represented. In contrast to some other offerings, where a few major institutional investors buy up the bulk of tokens, by November 19 there were more than 17,000 registered token holders.Even after the substantial initial boom, buyers continued to show interest in the company\u2019s project. A bit more than a month after the first results were announced, records showed that by December 24 the number of token holders had swollen to more than 50,000. Obviously, these cannot all be major institutional backers \u2013 the average purchase of tokens has been just north of $500.Crypterium co-founder and CEO Vladimir Gorbunov is understandably delighted by the results:I believe that of all the ICOs in the past few months, we are number one in terms of the number of token holders. We seem to appeal not just to people looking to acquire major holdings, but also to people just looking to actually use our currency. This broad-based support shows there is after all a mass market of people who are ready to use cryptocurrency and blockchain in their everyday life.Part of Crypterium\u2019s appeal may lie in the potential breadth of application of its cryptocurrency. As a future cryptobank, it is seeking to make its decentralized cryptocurrency ecosystem a part of daily life. To do so, it is creating a way to allow cryptocurrencies to be used to make instant payments for everyday purchases \u2013 paying bills, purchasing transit tickets, eating out \u2013 in short, every way one might use cash or a credit card.The project, which is based on an open-source platform, will also feature an innovative system to allow businesses to acquire cryptocurrencies (including an option for sellers to receive fiat currencies when purchases are made in cryptocurrency). The project\u2019s third area of focus is to turn crypto loans into a more accessible product. The fact that the cryptobank platform is open to outside developers is a major advantage.Crypterium\u2019s ICO continues through mid-January, so the final tally for the ICO is not yet known. For now, though, they must bask in the acquisition of a new following and the acclaim that comes with being the newest and brightest star in the cryptocurrency firmament.For more information about Crypterium please visit crypterium.io and download the project whitepaper.What are your thoughts on Crypterium?

Bitcoin Interest plans to fork at block 505083, on January 22, 2018.Bitcoin ForksBitcoin Interest is the recently announced fork of the Bitcoin network, including full replay protection. They\u2019re planning on changing a few things, but keeping more of the protocol together. For those of you who don\u2019t know, a fork is a split in the two networks. At the time of the fork, everyone who owns Bitcoins will have the same balance of BCI if they\u2019re holding when the fork happens. The fork will form two separate networks, with their own coins, users, merchants, and miners.There have been several since August, the first being Bitcoin Cash. Many followed that were questionable, such as Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, and some others that have gained absolutely no traction. Bitcoin Cash and Gold are the only two that have received support from the community.Bitcoin InterestThe team behind Bitcoin interest have made a few key changes, but kept the core consensus rules intact. The BCI network will support Segregated Witness and keep the 1MB blocksize limit. On top of this, they\u2019re changing the mining algorithm from SHA-256, the algorithm that all Bitcoin ASIC miners are built for, to another known as Equihash. Equihash does not currently have ASICs built for it, meaning that this new network can be mined using GPU consumer hardware. The average block creation time has been kept at ten minutes, and the 21-million-coin limit has been preserved.The coolest part about this new fork is the ability to earn interest on your current Bitcoin Interest holdings. Once the network launches, you\u2019ll be to \u201cpark\u201d your coins and earn interest payments on it. As opposed to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Interest blocks will have two rewards. They\u2019ll contain the standard miner reward along with a smaller reward that goes to a pool of investors who\u2019ve parked their coins.Interest RatesThis pool is known as the Interest Pool, and blocks at first will contain a 1.08 BCI reward that will be distributed amongst pool members. This reward will decrease as the block height increases. The interest rate that you\u2019ll receive is proportional to the numbers of coins you have parked compared to the total number of coins in the pool. For example, if you park 100 BCI and the pool\u2019s total is 1000BCI, you\u2019ll receive 10% of the interest rewards.You also have options for how long to park your coins, or interest cycles as they\u2019re referred to by the development team. You can park on a weekly or monthly basis, and if you unpark your coins during the interest period then you\u2019ll lose any interest rewards you would\u2019ve collected. The monthly option will pay out 70% of the rewards, whereas the weekly cycle will payout 30%.SupportWhile the fork does not have a wallet to support it yet, some exchanges are already starting to support the fork. HitBTC has announced support and it\u2019s assumed they\u2019ll credit users with BCI based on their BTC holdings held within the exchange.Since this fork has replay protection, it\u2019s much easier to claim your airdrop than if it didn\u2019t have those measures in place. Your BCI balance will be associated with your BTC private key, and you can simply enter your private key into any BCI wallet to have access to your coins. A word of warning however; make sure you move your Bitcoins to a different wallet with a different private key before you give out or private keys to anyone or any software. Keep it in a wallet until the date of the fork, and when you go to claim move them beforehand.For more information about Bitcoin Interest, please visit bitcoininterest.io.What do you think about this upcoming fork?

The cryptocurrency market cap managed to surpass the valuation of $638 billion and many experts believe that it will further increase.The Cryptocurrency Job Market2017 was one of the most exciting and interesting years for the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin and Ethereum had a spectacular bull run and managed to make huge gains for investors and traders. We also had a huge number of Initial Coin Offerings and a record-breaking amount of funding. ICOs managed to raise over $3.7 billion in funding for blockchain and cryptocurrency-related projects. Most of these startups were successfully able to raise their funding goals and are now on a hiring spree.An article by Fortune mentions that the number of Bitcoin and blockchain-related job listings grew by over 5,753%. Experts believe that this is just the start and that the number of Bitcoin jobs will rise further in the upcoming years. Some governments have decided to implement regulations and laws in order to attract Bitcoin companies to operate in their countries. The most recent example is Belarus, which implemented new laws to officially legalize cryptocurrencies and give them a tax-exempt status for the next five years in the hopes of attracting companies to start operations in the country.How Japan Will Benefit from BitcoinJapan has become one of the most popular countries for Bitcoin and blockchain-related companies. One of the major reasons for this situation is the fact that the Japanese government has proper regulations and laws that favor cryptocurrencies. Earlier this year, the Japanese government officially recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method. This caused a major price increase, as many Japanese investors decided to invest in the decentralized cryptocurrency.Analysts at Nomura believe that the price rise of Bitcoin has given many investors a very high return on investment, which might lead to a boost for the economy of Japan. The lead of the analyst team, Yoshiyuki Suimon, stated the following:Rises in asset values often result in a rise in consumer spending, too, known as the wealth effect. We estimate the wealth effect from unrealized gains on bitcoin trading by Japanese investors since the start of fiscal year 2017, and estimate a potential boost to consumer spending of 23.2-96.0 billion yen.He also added:Moreover, the fact that the rise in bitcoin prices was concentrated in 2017 fourth quarter could result in the wealth effect materialising in 2018 first quarter, and if that is the case, we estimate a potential boost to real GDP growth on an annualised quarter over quarter basis of up to about 0.3 percentage pointsThe effects of Bitcoin are multiple on the economy of Japan. Not only are further jobs being created, but the resulting wealth effect from the cryptocurrency\u2019s rise in value is spurring real and measurable economic growth. As more cryptocurrency exchanges and operations move to Japan, it\u2019s likely that this financial trend will continue unabated.What are your thoughts on the high amount of gains caused by Bitcoin?

While it is suspected staff at CNBC subsequently colluded with BCH executives, including Ver, to produce infamously aggressive anti-Bitcoin Twitter content this month, the Bitcoin.com owner maintains that his Bitcoin fork is the \u201creal\u201d Bitcoin.During the interview, Roger Ver told host Dave Rubin:If you have two versions of Bitcoin, one is slow, expensive and unreliable (Bitcoin SegWit) and you have another version of Bitcoin which is super fast, reliable and cheap, it\u2019s not a tough decision.While his words closely matched previous appearances on CNBC and elsewhere, Ver\u2019s plug says little about Bitcoin.After advocating BCH throughout the interview, it is perhaps no surprise that the altcoin\u2019s other proponents praised Rubin with tips, while BTC users withdrew their support.In the month following the Ver interview with David Rubin, BTC prices have settled after a period of intense volatility, with BCH\u2019s daily losses continuing to outpace them in USD terms.The current version of Bitcoin Cash can easily handle all of the Bitcoin Core and Ethereum transactions combined.\u2014 Roger Ver (@rogerkver) December 29, 2017Ver meanwhile continues to advertise BCH\u2019s alleged use cases as a currency, claiming on Twitter this week that the altcoin could handle the combined transaction volume of both BTC and Ethereum (ETH).What do you think about Roger Ver\u2019s latest tweets?

Around the world, people will be celebrating with friends and families, probably while singing an off-key version of Auld Lang Syne. Crypto enthusiasts will remember 2017 as the year that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exploded and became a part of the public consciousness. If you really want to ring in the New Year with a crypto bang, you could sign up for the Bitcoin Baller Package being sold by Skyline, a popular bar in Singapore. The cost? A single bitcoin.Should Auld Acquaintance Be ForgotPartygoers should have a great view during the Skyline party, dubbed Bianco, on New Year\u2019s Eve. The bar sits on the 45th floor of a skyscraper and looks out on the city\u2019s waterfront. Party goers will be decked out in white and can drink and dance the night away before enjoying an amazing fireworks display being held at the waterfront.So what does spending a bitcoin get you? The Bitcoin Baller Package includes the following: limousine pick-up, 2 butlers, and a platter of lobsters, oysters, and caviar. There\u2019s plenty of booze in the package as well as buyers also get:1 x Hendricks 1 x Ron Zacapa 23 1 x Cordon Bleu 1 x JW Blue Label 1 x Belvedere 6L 1 x Cristal 1 x Armand de Brignac 10 x DomsOf course, people are still free to pay cash for partying at Skyline. The bar admits that nobody has come forward and bought the Bitcoin Baller Package, whose cost currently runs close to $13,000.Skyline Used to CryptocurrencyThe Skyline bar in Singapore has run a number of successful cryptocurrency-themed events in the past. The main focus for such events is the people working in the financial technology sector, which is booming in Singapore. The bar was also the first club in the city-state to accept virtual currency when it began allowing Ethereum as a payment option on November 28th.Subaish Rajamanickam, manager at Skyline, says:We had a couple of cryptocurrency after-parties here, and we have also themed a night \u2026 called Crypto Thursdays. So that basically got the ball rolling for cryptocurrency acceptance here at Skyline.Some patrons of the club have said that they\u2019ll continue buying drinks in cash as the transaction fees are just too high to use on buying a drink or two. Still, a single martini is a far cry from the Bitcoin Baller Package. In the end, the important thing is that more and more businesses are accepting virtual currency as a viable payment option, and it appears that such acceptance will only grow in the new year.Would you pay one bitcoin for the party package at Skyline?

Yet there are times when a person perseveres and then prospers. Such is the case of Erik Finman, the teenage Bitcoin millionaire. He\u2019s only 19, but he\u2019s parlayed his initial Bitcoin investment into millions of dollars. Now he plans on building the \u201cworld\u2019s best university\u201d in the city of Dubai.Grandma\u2019s Gift Leads to MillionsThe tale of the teenage Bitcoin millionaire is fascinating. Back when he was 12 (in 2011), his grandmother gave him a gift of $1,000. His brother Scott gave him a tip about getting into Bitcoin. Back then, a single Bitcoin was only worth $12, so he bought as much as he could and then decided to hodl them.However, the story gets a lot more interesting. Erik Finman had a terrible time going through the school system. He was bored and unmotivated. He says one teacher even told him that he would never amount to anything, so he should just drop out of school and start flipping burgers at McDonalds.Finman\u2019s parents decided to pull him out of school, which is what he wanted, and began homeschooling him. In 2013, he cashed out some of his bitcoins to start an online education company called Botangle. This venture was designed for frustrated students like himself to find good teachers over video chat. He then began to intern at Silicon Valley start-ups and moved to San Francisco at age 15.A Family AffairFinman now owns 401 bitcoins, which is worth $4.9 million currently. He wants to use some of his Bitcoin wealth to create a new university in Dubai, and his whole family is involved in the project. His family already runs online teaching training in Dubai, using technology he developed through his Botangle project. Looking at his family, you could see why homeschooling was a really good choice. His father has a PhD in electrical engineering from Stanford, and his mom has a PhD in physics from Stanford. His brothers went to MIT.There will be lots of ups and downs for cryptocurrency on the way to the top!It\u2019s success is inevitable!It\u2019s unstoppable.\u2014 Erik Finman (@erikfinman) December 22, 2017 As for Dubai, Erik Finman chose it because:Dubai has really become the centre of the world. It already has the tallest building, it already has the biggest malls \u2013 I think it deserves to have the best education system in the world too, and I know that fits a lot of [the UAE\u2019s] goals.Finman personally believes that college is often a waste of time due to outmoded methods of education, which is why his university will feature a system that helps students like himself that are continually frustrated.As for Bitcoin, Finman has no concerns about the cryptocurrency\u2019s price fluctuations. He adds:But I think Bitcoin definitely has more to go, and I think cryptocurrency as a whole has a lot more to go. It\u2019s the next big thing. The only way you can take down by Bitcoin is not through its own doing, but if you make some better alternative to it. Whatever the winning cryptocurrency is \u2013 and right now that\u2019s Bitcoin \u2013 will get to millions of dollars of coin.It\u2019s quite possible that Erik Finman and his family could achieve something spectacular. They\u2019re obviously a very driven family. So far, the teenage Bitcoin millionaire has been doing everything right. Finman primarily holds bitcoins, but he also has some investments in Ethereum and Litecoin.Do you think Erik Finman will succeed in creating an innovative university that breaks the current mold? Don\u2019t you wish you had invested in Bitcoin when it was only $12 per coin?

When we showed our project to friends in the crypto community, we saw a big need for the kinds of tools 3commas has and so we decided to open the project to everyone.3Commas opened to the public in September 2017 and, primarily through word of mouth, has grown to over 5000 active traders and an average daily trade volume of over $5 million USD.Tools and FeaturesThe first thing that caught our attention about 3Commas was the clean, uncluttered interface. The platform offers a simple, logical user experience whether you are accessing it via a desktop computer or mobile device. Russian and English language options are available, as well, with additional languages in the works.Cryptocurrency exchange integrations3Commas integrates with Poloniex, Bittrex, Bitfinex, Binance, and any Ethereum wallet and the process of hooking up your exchange account to the platform is fast and simple thanks to easy-to-follow illustrated documentation. Additional exchanges will be added throughout the coming year.To minimize risk and to encourage smart trading habits, 3Commas has implemented two tools that every trader should learn to take advantage of \u2013 Trailing Stop Loss and Trailing Take Profit.Trailing Stop LossA Trailing Stop Loss order is identical to a standard Stop Loss order in all respects except one. Both let you minimize your losses in the event of a price drop, but unlike a Stop Loss order that is set manually at a fixed price threshold, a Trailing Stop Loss order is percentage-based and automatically adjusts to price fluctuations.For example, let\u2019s say you purchase 10 ETH at $675 each and to minimize any potential losses, you set a Stop Loss order of 10%. This means that if the price of ETH drops below $607.50, the stop loss order will automatically execute, selling your ETH at that price.But what if the price of ETH goes *up* during the day? A standard Stop Loss order will still only execute when the price drops below 10% of the original buy-in price. A Trailing Stop Loss order, however, automatically adjusts to the price change. So if the price of ETH goes up by 15%, the Trailing Stop Loss order would trigger when the adjusted price drops by 10%, netting you a 5% gain.Trailing Take ProfitJust like how the Trailing Stop Loss tool is designed to minimize losses, the Trailing Take Profit tool is designed to maximize gains. Using our Ethereum example from above, let\u2019s say you buy 10 ETH at $675 each and set a standard Take Profit order at $700. This means that you would make a profit of $25 per ETH.But what if ETH goes higher than $700? You\u2019ve just lost additional potential profit. A Trailing Take Profit order lets you sell at the highest part of a trend by selling at a percentage of the highest value. So if you set a Trailing Take Profit order of 10% and ETH climbs to $800 and then falls, the sell order would take effect when the price falls below $720 ($800 \u2013 10% = $720), netting you a profit of $45 per ETH.Custom Portfolios3Commas Portfolios tool is a unique feature that not only lets users track their actual portfolio\u2019s performance over time, but also lets them create custom \u201cdream portfolios\u201d of tokens and coins that they think could be profitable. These custom portfolios are publicly available to other users who can analyze them and even add them to their own actual portfolio.The Road Ahead2018 looks to be a very busy year for 3Commas. Several new trading tools will be added, including social trading and arbitrage trading. Social trading, which we are told will be rolled out sometime in February 2018, lets users \u2018follow\u2019 their favorite traders and copy their trades.Arbitrage trading will allow users to take advantage of price differences between one exchange and another. Essentially, traders will be able to buy low on one exchange and sell high on another. True crypto arbitrage trading capabilities are few and far between, so the launch of this tool, in particular, should be of great interest to the crypto community.For more information about 3Commas, or to try it out for yourself, visit 3commas.io.Ringing in the New Year with a 50% BonusIn true holiday spirit, and to usher in the new year in grand style, 3Commas are giving users a 50% bonus on all deposits from December 31, 2017, through January 3, 2018.

Blockchain solutions could be the answer for those seeking more freedom on the internet.A report in Thursday\u2019s New York Times stated that the Federal Communications Commission has voted to dismantle rules regulating the companies that connect users to the internet. This would effectively yield US broadband businesses more power to control online access and information.Net NeutralizedThe agency has scrapped the net neutrality regulations that previously prevented internet service providers blocking content or charging their customers for premium access and services. Previously setup by the Obama administration to ensure fair and equal access to web content, the FCC voted in net neutrality by classifying internet providers as Title II common carriers. The Trump administration has now removed this classification, unraveling the regulations that gave net neutrality legitimacy.It is a step backwards for internet freedom in the US, says Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat member of the FCC. She said that the vote puts the commission:\u2026 on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of the law, and the wrong side of the American public.She added that the revoke gives service providers:\u2026 a green light to discriminate and manipulate your internet traffic.According to the NYT, a number of Democrats on Capitol Hill called for a bill that would reestablish the regulations, and several Democratic state attorneys general said they would file suits to stop the change.However, proponents of the change state that consumer protection will be enhanced as the Federal Trade Commission will now regain their jurisdiction over broadband providers, an authority that was stripped away due to the Obama-era legislation. Even the first FTC chairman under Obama said that restoring authority to the FTC is a good thing and that the internet will continue to thrive. It is also argued that Silicon Valley already engages in online censorship of opinions they don\u2019t agree with, and the repeal of the previous legislation will help ensure healthy competition.In a speech, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai notes:Returning to the legal framework that governed the Internet from President Clinton\u2019s pronouncement in 1996 until 2015 is not going to destroy the Internet. It is not going to end the Internet as we know it. It is not going to kill democracy. It is not going to stifle free expression online. If stating these propositions alone doesn\u2019t demonstrate their absurdity, our Internet experience before 2015, and our experience tomorrow, once this order passes, will prove them so.Blockchain SolutionsWith the overwhelming number of new ICOs emerging, there must be one that can tackle issues such as internet censorship and ISP control. Enter Substratum, a decentralized blockchain with, according to their website: \u2026 an open-source network that allows anyone to allocate spare computing resources to make the internet a free and fair place for the entire world.Participants running a Substratum node will get paid in cryptocurrency for serving content which helps to build a better and more open internet. Savvy crypto traders saw the opportunity, and the price of SUB shot up as the FCC news filtered out into the media. SUB tokens have been a flat line around $0.10 up until the end of November, at which point they started to climb. They spiked to an all-time high of $0.50 a few hours ago but have corrected to $0.40 at the time of writing. It is likely Substratum will see steady gains over the next day or so.What are your opinions on the repeal of the net neutrality rules passed during the Obama administration?

Most of the banking bigwigs would prefer to publicly denigrate it as it poses a threat to their business model, which largely revolves around making money off other people\u2019s money. As prices started to soar, mainstream investors and financial institutions started to pay attention to Bitcoin and its brethren.According to a Fortune report, Bloomberg is the latest to acknowledge the prevalence of cryptocurrencies in today\u2019s financial markets. It has added the big three: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin prices to its terminal services, which major banks and investment houses use across the globe.Altcoins AcknowledgedThe addition of Ethereum and Litecoin is a strong indicator that altcoins are also gaining traction and are slowly becoming as recognized as Bitcoin. Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency to Bitcoin, with a market capacity of $62 billion at the time of writing. It has had an epic three days, rising over 60% to an all-time high of $752 yesterday.Since the beginning of the year, Ethereum has seen an immense increase in value, rising a whopping 7400% from around $10 in January to over $750 this week. The future is bright for this crypto as more financial institutions, businesses, and blockchain organizations seek to use its platform and smart contracts to conduct their operations.Litecoin has also witnessed a meteoric ascent, rising over 275% this week alone. LTC is the fifth largest crypto currency, with a current market capacity of $14.4 billion, according to analytics website CoinMarketCap. It has risen from around $95 to just over $340 in four days. A market correction has seen prices fall back to $265, which is still a mammoth 5800% up on the few bucks it was worth at the beginning of this year.Litecoin is often seen as a good alternative to Bitcoin as it is a fraction of the price and has a superior blockchain which affords it much faster transaction times. With a total supply of only 84 million and almost 65% already circulating, it has great potential to go much higher next year.Price DifferenceBloomberg declined to comment on the decision to add the new altcoins to their terminal. According to the report, a person familiar with the corporation said they were added as a feature for foreign exchange traders. They added that the prices were drawn from the Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp. Cryptocurrency prices can vary a lot from exchange to exchange and country to country.Will other companies follow Bloomberg\u2019s decision to include cryptocurrency?

Bitcoin was rightfully accepted as mainstream in the financial world, and achieved astonishing growth, both in value and adoption. Next year, Bitcoin\u2019s battlefield will most likely move into the U.S. Congress, where a bill has been introduced that allegedly could stifle innovation by burdening the crypto ecosystem with unnecessary, confusing, and even redundant regulatory obligations.The U.S. Congress to Pass Legislation Burdening CryptocurrenciesBitcoin enthusiasts are worried because the U.S. Congress might pass legislation that could stifle the free development of cryptocurrency technologies.Specifically, Bitcoin supporters are focusing on bill S.1241, which has been introduced in Congress under the title \u201cCombating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017.\u201dThe Bitcoin Foundation opposes this bill because it would create confusion in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Bitcoin Foundation explains:For those not familiar with the Act, it seeks to define anyone issuing, redeeming, or cashing Bitcoin as a financial institution. This would require them to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5312 and require them to adopt the same formal reporting procedures as financial institutions for the purpose of reporting suspicious transactions.Previously, in 2011, S.1241 was introduced, but it did not pass. Subsequently, in 2013, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a guidance entitled \u201cApplication of FinCEN\u2019s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies.\u201dCoin Center argues that the FinCEN guidance already accomplishes the policy goals of the bill\u2019s section aimed at digital currency. Therefore, Coin Center contends:If the bill were to pass today, however, it would sow a lot of uncertainty since it would likely supersede the FinCEN guidance and all the work on the part of industry and Treasury to build a reasonable AML regime for the digital currencies. This is especially true because many of the key terms in the bill are not defined.Opposition to Bill S.1241 is GrowingIn addition to Coin Center and the Bitcoin Foundation, the Chamber of Digital Commerce is also getting ready to defend the cryptocurrency industry in front of the U.S. Congress.In fact, the Chamber of Digital Commerce already wrote to Congress with regard to S.1241, stating:The proposed amendment is unnecessary because FinCEN has already acted to include virtual currency exchangers and administrators within the coverage of the BSA [Bank Secrecy Act].Moreover, many in social media are calling cryptocurrency enthusiasts to contact their senator to shut down the bill. For example, according to the website save-crypto.com, \u201cSenator Diane Feinstein is trying to push a bill to essentially make it illegal to use cryptocurrencies.\u201d And the site asks cryptocurrency supporters to request their congressman to vote against S.1241.The support in opposing \u00a71241 has been superb! We recently presented our feedback and proposed changes to \u00a71241, an untenable and premature regulatory burden.

It is one of only four P2P lending platforms licensed by the MAS. The project\u2019s vision is to build a tokenized Pan-Asian lending exchange based on smart contracts, to ensure cost-effective, safe and efficient cashflows between lenders and borrowers. The platform will include blockchain-based identity management, 40+ variable KYC due diligence, and a distributed asset exchange.Powerful Security and Due Diligence + AI-powered Credit ScoringCrowd Genie will create a \u201cdigital passport\u201d for each client, both lenders and borrowers, using due diligence procedures that ensure compliance with KYC, AML/CFT, cybersecurity, and privacy requirements. Blockchain smart contract technology will make it possible for verified users to perform lending transactions instantaneously and at a much lower cost. The tokenization of assets on the distributed asset exchange will allow Crowd Genie to trade in fractions of assets from asset classes that would otherwise be too expensive or impractical to trade using traditional methods.The project utilizes an AI-powered credit scoring engine to take information from the documents submitted by prospective borrowers and assess their creditworthiness. As the data set increases, the AI engine constantly adjusts the scoring algorithm by reevaluating and back-testing the data. Crowd Genie is also the only platform where the platform directors always participate in each asset listing. This ensures that the motivation and interests of all parties concerned are the same.According to Crowd Genie founder Akshay Mehra:We feel that going into an ICO as an already established business has its advantages. We have had time to fine-tune our platform, making it the most comprehensive on the market. Ours is the only platform that incorporates the entire lending process, from KYC verification to asset lending. No startup can say the same.Crowd Genie ICOThe public ICO will begin on January 15, 2018, and will run until February 15, 2018. On offer will be 50,000,000 CGCOINs, a utility token which can be used to trade on the Crowd Genie platform. When a transaction is performed in CGCOINs, the lender purchases the corresponding amount of CGCOIN tokens and transfers them to the borrower. The borrower can then either use the tokens to receive a fiat currency or keep them in the cryptocurrency, ensuring natural demand for the tokens.Borrowers will receive incentives for making on-time payments on loans. For each repayment, borrowers will receive CGCOIN \u201cCredits\u201d, a disposable asset that will be tracked separately in the digital passport. These credits will be visible and will improve the borrower\u2019s reputation in the system, thereby allowing them to receive larger loans and/or lower interest rates.Speaking about the Crowd Genie project, ICOBox co-founder Nick Evdokimov remarked:This is a project with a great upside. The fact that Crowd Genie is already a going concern is a real plus. The use of emerging blockchain technologies will make the platform more dependable, inexpensive and faster. We are very pleased that ICOS token holders have recognized the value of the project, and look forward to a successful ICO.Crowd Genie\u2019s goal is to collect 100,000 ETH through the token sale. The base price is 1 ETH for 400 tokens. All unsold tokens will be burned.For more information about Crowd Genie please visit crowd-genie.com.What are your thoughts on the Crowd Genie project?

Poloz, continuing his view on the issue, emphasized that Canadians should respect the \u201csafety\u201d of bank-issued paper bills.\u201cA question that does preoccupy me is: what does the arrival of cryptocurrencies mean for the cash in your pocket?\u201d he continued.\u2026It\u2019s often forgotten that the cash provided by a central bank is the only truly risk-free means of payment.US Watchdog Denies Cryptocurrency ImpactWhile citizens of economies under the control of central banks such as Venezuela\u2019s or India\u2019s may disagree with Poloz, the \u2018risks\u2019 of Bitcoin and its ilk appear to concern US authorities across the border considerably less.In its annual report of \u201cnightmares\u201d the financial system could encounter, as Bloomberg describes them today, the Financial Stability Oversight Board dedicated only a few lines of a report spanning more than 150 pages to cryptocurrency.\u201cVirtual currencies are only used by a very small number of consumers,\u201d it stated, adding that its \u201ccurrent impact on financial stability is likely very limited.\u201dWhat do you think about Stephen Poloz\u2019s views on cryptocurrency?

He fled to the embassy in 2012 to escape extradition attempts from Sweden for an alleged rape, but Sweden eventually dropped the charges against him. However, the UK police still have a warrant for his arrest for breaking his bail conditions when he moved into the embassy. There he sits, but he and his organization are still proving themselves to be a thorn in the sides of the extremely powerful.It seems fitting for WikiLeaks to support Bitcoin SegWit addresses as many governments are working to restrict cryptocurrency.

Saxo Bank Predicts Bitcoin will Fall to $1000 in 2018 Jeff Francis | Dec 09, 2017 | 07:00 Share Tweet Send Share Saxo Bank, the Danish investment bank, makes its annual list of Outrageous Predictions, and one of the biggest is that Bitcoin will drop to a mere $1,000.As 2017 winds down to its inevitable conclusion, a lot of people are looking ahead to 2018. Which means that a lot of predictions are going to be made over the next few weeks. Saxo Bank, a Danish investment bank, just released its annual Outrageous Predictions list that covers everything from finance to politics. In a bold move, Saxo Bank declares that Bitcoin will rise in 2018, only to sharply fall down to a mere $1,000 USD.Saxo Bank HQGazing into the Crystal BallFor their 2017 Bitcoin prediction, Saxo Bank said that the cryptocurrency would easily triple from $700 to over $2,100. It\u2019s definitely true that Bitcoin reached that number, but then it kept going \u2026 and going \u2026. and going \u2026 until it reached over $18,000 before dropping back to just over $15,000.Their prediction for Bitcoin in 2018 is even wilder than last year\u2019s. Saxo Bank predicts that the cryptocurrency will continue to gain in value through most of 2018, peaking above $60,000 with a market cap of more than $1 trillion. This surge will be fueled by investors and funds who will be more comfortable trading futures on the new exchanges rather than buying Bitcoin itself.Crashing Back to EarthThis amazing ride of Bitcoin reaching $60,000 will come to a horrible end though, as Saxo Bank says that the currency will come crashing down due to China and Russia working to engineer a massive crash. Bitcoin will go from soaring high in the sky to laying in a crater, being worth only $1,000.In their Outrageous Predictions for 2018, Saxo Bank envisions:Before long, however, the Bitcoin phenomenon finds the rug torn out from under it as Russia and China move deftly to sideline and even prohibit non-sanctioned cryptocurrencies domestically. Russia officially enters the cryptocurrency mining space to influence protocol developments and shift the focus away from Bitcoin in an effort to keep more Russian capital onshore. China makes a similar move, cracking down on cryptocurrencies by banning the mining of the most popular ones within China, citing energy waste and environmental concerns, but likewise fearing the risk of Bitcoin as a vehicle for capital flight.Instead, China launches an officially backed cryptocurrency that entails less energy-intensive mining. The smoother functioning of the state-run protocols for actual payments and price stability, as well as the heavy hand of state intervention, drives a decreasing interest in all cryptocurrencies and completely sidelines the Bitcoin and crypto phenomenon from a price speculation angle even as the technological promise of the blockchain gallops on.I have to say, that\u2019s one hell of a prediction that\u2019s full of doom and gloom for crypto enthusiasts. If you put stock into what Saxo Bank is peddling, then you better be ready to bail when Bitcoin starts nearing that $60,000 peak. I could definitely see countries working to shut down cryptocurrencies that they don\u2019t control, but it may be that Bitcoin and other digital currencies may have gained enough of a foothold to stay alive by then. Even in such an event, I don\u2019t think Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will go away as many people all over the world will still yearn to have a measure of economic freedom, which is something that only decentralized digital currencies could bring them.The entire list of Outrageous Predictions from Saxo Bank is an interesting read. Some of their other predictions include:Ten cent Outstrips Apple, Becomes World\u2019s Largest Company\u2018Austro-Hungarian Empire\u2019 Threatens EU TakeoverBank of Japan Forced to Abandon Yield Curve ControlFed Loses Independence as US Treasury Takes ChargeYou can download their PDF containing all of their predictions here.Do you think Saxo Bank is right that Bitcoin will rise and then plummet massively in 2018?

We designed Zen to solve a real problem: trading assets without relying on third parties.Our team is based in Tel Aviv, with backgrounds in maths, finance, design, and marketing. Some of us have been involved in the Bitcoin space since 2011, and we\u2019ve been creating tools to make Bitcoin better since 2013.In 2016, we began work on Zen Protocol. When Ethereum\u2019s \u201ctheDAO\u201d contract was hacked, it became clear to us that a platform designed for financial uses, like creating assets and granting rights, could provide much more security than was available at the time. Since then, we have been working on a new architecture that makes finance on the blockchain safe, fast, and useful.Zen Protocol uses an all-new codebase, with built-in tools that stop bugs from ever making it into the smart contracts you use on the platform. Zen will let you create and trade any sort of financial asset, with a modern system for using real-world data, and with links to the Bitcoin network. All of this is running right now in our testnet.Our crowdsale began on the 30th of November: over two-thirds of tokens have already been sold.Here are a few key points about Zen:Safe. The Zen Protocol uses a custom language, ZF*, that lets developers prove their contracts work correctly. Not only does this make contracts safer, it reduces development cost by accelerating testing and due diligence.Fast. Contracts are \u201cproof of cost\u201d, meaning that they show how long they take to run before they enter the Zen blockchain. This lets Zen Protocol can compile contracts, making them much faster than contracts on other blockchains.Useful. We\u2019ve implemented an architecture for Zen that makes it easy to create and trade real-world assets. Any kind of asset or token on Zen Protocol is compatible with any contract, and oracles link products on Zen to any sort of data from the outside world.Check out our blog, pitch deck, and Telegram group, and view full details of the crowdsale.

Donbass, Abkhazia Follow SuitDespite the Western perspective that sanctions have dealt a serious blow to Russia\u2019s economic stability, other sources contest this, doubting whether they in fact serve to disrupt fiscal or political policy in a major way. On the fringes of the geopolitical spat, authorities in the conflict zone of Eastern Ukraine have publicly called for full cryptocurrency implementation as a way to shore up the economic prowess of their fledgling unrecognized republics.So too has fellow Russian-backed unrecognized state Abkhazia, which during a conference in Moscow last month expressed plans to create a national \u2018Abkhazia Coin\u2019 and use it to replace cash as soon as 2022.

Before we look ahead, however, let\u2019s take a look back at just how far Bitcoin has come this year. 2017 may well be remembered as a watershed year for Bitcoin. Starting the year at $963.66, the digital currency\u2019s price has exploded, surging over 1800% and culminating in an all-time high of $18353.40 on December 8, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap, which rose from $15.4 billion to $249.9 billion, rivals that of all but a handful of S&P 500 companies. The cryptocurrency market as a whole has performed well this year, going from a market cap of just over $2.2 billion, excluding Bitcoin, to $151.8 billion \u2013 a gain of 6800%.Many top investors and experts have already started to predict Bitcoin\u2019s price in 2018. Famous investor and Bitcoin proponent Mike Novogratz believes that Bitcoin could go as high as $40,000 next year, while Kenetic Capital\u2019s Jehan Chu is even more optimistic, predicting $50,000 by the end of 2018. Looking even further into Bitcoin\u2019s future, Winklevoss twins Cameron an Tyler stated that it would become a multi-trillion dollar asset.How Futures are Going to Affect Bitcoin PriceIn the last couple of days, the Bitcoin price dropped several thousand dollars from its all-time high due uncertainty regarding Bitcoin futures. Some analysts believe that the roll-out of Bitcoin futures by CBOE and CME Group may result in volatility stabilization for Bitcoin, which could make Bitcoin a more stable asset and thus a more attractive investment option for investors. A price stabilization may also slow the rapid price growth that Bitcoin has seen in the last couple of months. In a recent interview with BusinessInsider, BitMex\u2019s head of development, Grey Dwyer, stated following regarding the concerns around Bitcoin futures:Bitcoin now trades, pretty much, on unregulated markets. The fact that it\u2019s going to start trading on the CME and CFE brings an air of legitimacy to the space, because it\u2019s going to bring in mainstream and professional investors, and have them be more comfortable participating in the futures market which is more regulated.Of course, there are some experts who believe that futures trading could actually exacerbate Bitcoin\u2019s volatility, at least initially.Currently, Bitcoin has managed to climb back to the $15k area after it drastically dropped to $13k. In the next upcoming days/weeks will definitely some action on Bitcoin\u2019s price as the futures markets start trading.What are your thoughts on the current price of Bitcoin?

With South Korea reportedly accountable for over a quarter of the global trade in crypto currency, its government is considering taxing cryptocurrencies.The average citizen can partake in this feverish market, and South Koreans are taking to cryptocurrencies in droves. Governments are naturally cautious entities, especially those in Asia which tend to be more autocratic than their western counterparts. According to a Reuters report, the South Korea government said on Wednesday that it may tax capital gains from cryptocurrency trading as concern from global regulators about a bubble escalated. Warning from Down UnderAustralia\u2019s central bank chief also issued a warning of a \u201cspeculative mania\u201d that has caused prices to skyrocket over the past month. A further step towards virtual currency mainstream acceptance was made when US exchange CBOE launched their Bitcoin futures contracts on Sunday, with CME to follow this weekend. Policy makers have been forced to pay attention to cryptocurrencies now that they are gaining more momentum.An emergency meeting today in Seoul concluded with the government stating that it will consider taxing capital gains from the trading of virtual coins and will also ban minors from opening accounts on exchanges. According to Reuters, the head of marketing at Hong Kong-based exchange Gatecoin, Thomas Glucksmann, stated:The regulations in Korea will not have a negative effect, licensing brings certainty, which encourages already regulated entities \u2026 to get involved in addition to skeptical retail investors.South Korean crypto exchange giant Bithumb stated that it would be fully compliant with any potential regulation from the government and adequately capitalize itself to protect its clients. Earlier this week, the finance minister said that ministries are in talks to decide whether such trading should be regulated. The chief of the financial regulator said some Justice Ministry officials are calling for an outright ban on cryptocurrency trading, though no official decision has been made.Crypto Prices StableBitcoin-related shares in Seoul tumbled in early trade on news of the government\u2019s emergency meeting, but they soon rebounded as the statement did not confirm any prohibitions. Bitcoin itself has been trading sideways for a couple of days and currently sits just below $17,000, according to Coinmarketcap. Litecoin, a favorite in Korea, reached an all-time high yesterday, and Ethereum and Ripple are currently trading at their highest levels.

Few industries are more prone to fraud and lies than the news industry, and PressCoin is looking to take on this monumental task.The Rise of Fake NewsIn recent years, we\u2019ve seen the monumental effect the mainstream media can have on public opinion. The 2016 presidential election is one of the clearest cut examples. An enormous amount of news fed to the American people that was flat out not true from both sides of the political aisle. Out of this the term \u201cfake news\u201d was born, and accusations of media outlets reporting on fake news and propagating it to their customers with malicious intent blew up like wildfire.The internet giants became the lightning rod for this phenomenon: newsfeed and search algorithms by design select what content people see. And in an age where people usually only get their news from one or two sources, these companies have an enormous responsibility to provide accurate and impartial content. Some don\u2019t take this responsibility as seriously as they should, and as we saw last year and continue to see today, they can also take advantage of this power for their own agendas.Collecting Revenue from Quality ContentAnother problem facing the Journalism industry today is the problem of ever falling revenue from their news content. Before the advent of the internet, newspapers and your nightly news were your only sources, now there are thousands of sources, which you mostly find via Facebook and GoogleBack in the day you paid for your weekly newspaper subscription and that \u2013 and \u201crivers of gold\u201d in advertising revenue, provided income to news publishers. When the majority of news readers moved to the internet, many publishers were faced with a common problem; they couldn\u2019t get the same amount of money from online publications. Solutions such as on-site advertisements helped, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Some resorted to paywalls, but that tends to turn away readers.The Proposed SolutionThe team behind PressCoin are developing several solutions to the issues plaguing the news industry. They\u2019ve proposed the creation of not a single answer, but a whole network of media companies, each a microcosm of news publishers, writers and news consumers, where every interaction becomes a transaction. Everything from writing quality content, running exit polls, sparking meaningful debate in the comments section, or helping to moderate, to providing needed information for the public to assist them to make an educated voting decision will be tracked, and in some cases monetized via the platform\u2019s native currency, the PressCoin (Ticker: NEWS).A Reputation System will be stored on the blockchain. Through this, whenever you see a piece of news whether it be via your Facebook feed or Reddit, consumers will be able to check the source against the reputation system to evaluate its credibility. The system will not only apply to publishers, but to commenters as well. Everyone will be held to a standard, and failing to hold to that standard will result in a loss of reputation and therefore credibility. Publishers who spread fake news will be penalized and their reputation tarnished.PressCoin is already being implemented on several new platforms. One example, currently under construction, is called NextElection. NextElection will monitor politicians and elections around the world, tracking their constituencies and relevant issues, after all there is always a next election around the corner! The Platform will enable voters to participate in their elections in a way never seen before.Several components in each election will be tracked by the platform, including things such as incumbents, challengers, and the issues that are being debated on the campaign trail \u2013 and perhaps also the incidence of fake news. This will assist voters to make more informed decision come election day, and hopefully improve democracy everywhere. An advanced version of a blockchain-based voting system is in the works for a test launch in 2018.While NextElection is a good example of the power of the PressCoin system, there are several companies and products already in the works around investigative reporting, solutions journalism, citizen journalism, and hyperlocal news. Several new technology startups launching via PressCoin Accelerator Program, a venture arm, round out the initial launch.PressCoin ICOPressCoin is currently wrapping up their Pre-ICO, which began on November 22, and ends on December 10, 2017. It will be followed by their main ICO, which will run from December 11, 2017, through January 8, 2018. Bonuses will be awarded to early participants, as the first five million coins sold will be accompanied by a 30% bonus. The bonus decreases as more and more people buy up the available tokens and the ICO progresses.At launch, one PressCoin will have a parity with the US dollar. The token also represents shares in the PressCoin PLC company, based in the UK, and investors will have access to earnings information, annual reports and the like. PressCoin holders will not only hold tokens, but since each token is linked via smart-contract with an equity share in the company, token holders will also receive dividends. These properties make PressCoin an unusual ICO, and for the news industry a unique opportunity.For more information about PressCoin and the upcoming ICO please visit their website and download the project white paper.Do you think that PressCoin can revitalize and re-monetize the news industry?

Bitcoin is way more portable and way more divisible. At a $300 billion market cap, it\u2019s certainly seen a lot of price appreciation, but gold is at $6 trillion and if bitcoin disrupting gold is true and it plays out\u2026 then you can see 10 to 20 times appreciation because there is a significant delta still.He also added:Long term, directionally, it is a multitrillion-dollar asset \u2014 I don\u2019t know how long it takes to get there.We\u2019ve seen the bubble term thrown around and it\u2019s just not the right way to look at this.Most Bitcoin and blockchain industry leaders also do believe that Bitcoin will one day disrupt the financial market and become a trillion dollar ecosystem that will power many decentralized applications and services.What are your thoughts on the Cameron\u2019s and Tyler\u2019s opinion on Bitcoin?

As a result, cryptocurrency exchanges are already taking precautionary measures.Bitcoin\u2019s Volatility About to IncreaseBitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations are wild. Its price can swing by more than $3,000 USD in just a few hours. Traditionally, volatility is measured by the volatility index, also known as the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). However, as of this writing, Bitcoin does not yet have a generally accepted index.Bitcoin futures trading is here. CBOE Global Markets will start trading Bitcoin futures (XBT) on December 10, 2017. Then CME Group will launch Bitcoin futures, based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), on December 18, 2017. And, according to Bloomberg, NASDAQ might be planning to launch Bitcoin futures sometime in 2018.How will futures trading affect Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility? Nobody knows.Allice Lloyd George, an investor at RRE Ventures, posed this very question to Arthur Hayes, CEO of BitMEX, who already has firsthand experience running cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges in Hong Kong. George asked Hayes whether futures markets will help the ecosystem and smooth out volatility. Hayes replied:Initially, because of the way these contracts are structured, they will actually increase the volatility of Bitcoin.In fact, Bitcoin exchanges are getting ready to face an upsurge in volatility when the trading of Bitcoin futures contracts starts. Already, Bitcoin is swinging to the downside by a fifth of its value, hours before the starting of futures trading.Bitcoin\u2019s Inelasticity Drives its Price VolatilityThere is an array of factors that drives Bitcoin\u2019s volatility, such as adverse press which in turn affects adoption rate. In addition, other factors are government treatment of the cryptocurrency, and hackings of Bitcoin exchanges.Moreover, Bitcoin is inherently volatile because of its illiquidity. By design, only 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined. This lack of liquidity makes Bitcoin inflation-resistant and incentivizes miners. Furthermore, illiquidity makes Bitcoin inelastic, and hence volatile.Investopedia defines elasticity:Elasticity refers the degree to which individuals, consumers or producers change their demand or the amount supplied in response to price or income changes.As Erik Norland, Executive Director and Senior Economist, CME Group, explains:No matter how high prices go, miners will not produce more than 21 million coins. Moreover, price increases won\u2019t necessarily incentivize a more rapid mining of bitcoin. Even if they did, it would only influence miners to create more bitcoin today at the expense of creating less in the future since the total supply will reach a hard, asymptotic limit of 21 million coins. The supply inelasticity explains in large part why bitcoin is so volatile.Bitcoin is a battle-tested, sturdy animal. Time and again, it has demonstrated itself to be remarkably resilient. Now, Bitcoin is about to be tested by the new environment that futures trading will impose. Bitcoin will undoubtedly show once again its inherent capacity to quickly adjust to an ever-changing environment, and then, with renewed force, it will continue its ever ascending trajectory.How do you think futures trading will affect Bitcoin\u2019s volatility??

By 2020, Bitcoin\u2019s operations are supposedly set to use more electricity than the entire world.Analytics from Digieconomist indicate that Bitcoin\u2019s power consumption ranges within that of countries such as Oman, Morocco, Serbia, and Denmark. Further statistics showed that Bitcoin could help power several nations given its massive energy consumption. For example, Bitcoin can provide 0.8% of energy in the U.S., 5.7% in Germany, 9.8% in the U.K., 24.4% in the Netherlands, and 48.4% in the Czech Republic. Why Is the Energy Consumption So High?Bitcoin operates through users known as miners, who are tasked with the generation of new blocks every ten minutes. The miners rely on a set of codes that operate Bitcoin to produce a valid block. To prevent a surge of blocks, Bitcoin relies upon random selection in a distributed network, which often makes mining operations more of a trial and error affair.The miner that is first to create a valid block receives 12.5 newly created bitcoins and the transaction fees from processed transactions in the new block. Miners who failed to create the valid block will then discard the blocks they had been working on and start on new ones. For this reason, miners are continually working to be the lucky one getting the first valid block, hence the massive power consumption. Bitcoin\u2019s Growing Carbon FootprintIt takes more than 1.7 billion attempts before a new valid block is created. Given that half of the world\u2019s miners are based in China, which mainly uses coal-fired powered plants, this can be extremely worrying for those concerned with Bitcoin\u2019s carbon footprint. An example of the massive power use is that a single facility in China has over 25,000 computers operating that consume over $40,000 worth of electricity daily.The amount of Bitcoin mining going on in Venezuela has supposedly led to blackouts and the draining of electricity that could be used to power homes. Of course, the economic situation in Venezuela is so dire, people have to mine for bitcoins in order to stay alive.According to the The Times, Eric Holthaus, a climate change advocate, Bitcoin\u2019s electricity demand will eventually outstrip what is available. He maintains that Bitcoin\u2019s operations will consume more electricity by 2019 than the entire United States uses at the present time. He further goes on to say, that by February 2020, Bitcoin mining operations will use as much electricity as the world uses today. Possible AlternativesThere are some possible solutions to combat this power use by Bitcoin mining. One option is to switch to a proof-of-stake mechanism. Other options include the manufacture of more energy-efficient technologies used in mining operations as well as the upcoming Lightning Network.However, it must be pointed out that technology could keep pace with increased energy consumption. Power plants become more efficient due to innovations in technology, and more power plants (whether they\u2019re nuclear, biomass, coal, or other) are continuously being built. So all this talk of Bitcoin\u2019s power consumption swamping the world could just as easily come to naught.Do you think that countries should crack down on Bitcoin mining to reduce power consumption? Should anybody worry about the energy expenditure used in Bitcoin mining?

It\u2019s recent skyrocketing in price has led to a massive upsurge in account openings and trading as people look to climb aboard the Bitcoin bandwagon.In recent weeks, the number of new Bitcoin accounts has seen a major upsurge. In addition, trading in Bitcoin has reached unprecedented levels. This is in light of the expected launch of the Bitcoin futures contracts by Cboe and CME. This move has helped push the Bitcoin frenzy into overdrive, which resulted in the price of Bitcoin temporarily crossing $18,000 before dropping back down to $15,000.How Many Accounts Have Been Opened?Blockchain, a wallet service for the cryptocurrency, said that it saw a record 500,000 accounts opened within just four days. This has taken the total number of accounts opened thus far to about 20 million, which is double what it was a year ago. Besides that, transactions have been ramped up tremendously. In one day, the transactions reached 444,000, which was double what it was two years ago. This shows that there\u2019s tremendous interest by investors and funds in dabbling in Bitcoin futures contracts without the hassle of actually having to buy the cryptocurrency itself. Making Bitcoin MainstreamAccording to most digital currency experts, this move is a major boost to making Bitcoin mainstream. It is not just companies dedicated to digital currencies that are showing a major interest in Bitcoin.This interest is evident as the second and third most viewed shares on Hargreaves Lansdown, the United Kingdom\u2019s largest investment shop, are two funds that offer access to Bitcoin. The two funds are, in order of viewing, XBT Provider Bitcoin Tracker, who is based in Stockholm, and Bitcoin Investment Trust. In fact, the Bitcoin Investment Trust is trading at a 35pc premium, which means individuals are paying that much more per share than the value of the Bitcoin held per share.The only entity attracting more attention than the Bitcoin funds is Lloyds Banking Group.This shows that there is a huge demand amongst those who don\u2019t want to actually purchase Bitcoin but are quite happy to speculate on its associated futures contracts. Even online searches for Bitcoin has increased dramatically, and \u201cbuy Bitcoin\u201d is more popular than what \u201cbuy gold\u201d was during the height of the last financial crisis.Do you support the idea of Bitcoin going mainstream?

He predicts that it could hit $150,000 by 2021 and millions thereafter. A while back, Marc van der Chijs wanted to retire, but he only managed six weeks of it before he gave up. Recently, he set up First Block Capital, which is a fund that invests in digital currencies, in order to reach his goal of collecting a billion dollars within a couple of years.Van der Chijs is a firm believer in digital currencies and the blockchain technology that drives it. He recently gave a speech at the Crypto Investment Summit held in Ede, the Netherlands. Organizer Vincent Everts asked Van der Chijs for a prediction as he had predicted last year that Bitcoin would hit $10,000, which happened. He said that he believes that Bitcoin will hit the $15,000 mark by the end of this year (which it has), saying:There are all kinds of professional investors who want to add it to their portfolio this year, so that they can show that they are in it.For 2018, Van der Chijs expects Bitcoin to hit about $40,000, stating:There is still a great deal of institutional money waiting on the sidelines to participate in this market.By 2021, he predicts that it will have surpassed or hit the $150,000 mark. When it becomes an accepted means of payment around the world, he predicts it will have hit millions of dollars in value due to the fact that since there is only 21 million Bitcoin globally, the demand will rise, but the supply will not. Thus, its value will only continue to rise. Early InvestingMarc van der Chijs started making money long ago in China. After studying for a BA in the Netherlands, he joined the German company Daimler and moved to Beijing as the company\u2019s financial controller.Later on, he met Gary Wang through his wife, Grace. The two joined up and created the biggest video site in China,Tudou. The company was publicly listed in 2011 with a valuation of $822 million. Four years later, Alibaba bought the company at over $4 billion. However, Van der Chijs is not a billionaire; to him, that is an advantage as he notes:In the billionaires around me, I see that the drive is gone. They are no longer interested in companies in which a few million must be invested. Actually, it is an advantage that I am not extremely rich. That is why I think differently. I still have the incentive to invest and to earn from it.Seeing the Cryptocurrency LightDuring the financial crisis in Cyprus, banks blocked access to customer accounts to prevent a bank run. This meant Marc van der Chijs could not access funds for his company. After this, he began to take a keen interest in the financial and banking systems. He soon realized that the alternative was digital currencies, saying:I saw that it was something that changed the world, especially because of the blockchain. That will become a kind of second Internet and turn industries upside down.By speaking at conferences globally, Marc van der Chijs is helping to spread the word on Bitcoin. In 2015, he was able to visit Necker Island, owned by Richard Branson. There he talked about Bitcoin to about 150 people. Another prediction of Van der Chijs is that banks will soon begin to offer Bitcoin accounts, allowing you to convert Bitcoin into fiat currency with just the touch of a button.Do you think Bitcoin will reach a high of $150,000? What if Van der Chijs is correct in his prediction? Let us know in the comments below.

As Bitcoin finished a tumultuous trading week, with coin prices climbing from $11,000 to heights of near $20,000 on the GDAX exchange, the weekend has brought worries of what effect futures trading will have on Bitcoin, especially in regard to market manipulation believed to be rife in the barely regulated Bitcoin market.CBOE Market ProtectionsBecause of the unique risks inherent with Bitcoin, CBOE are enforcing a number of safeguards, including halting trading for 2 minutes if the price swings more than 10% from the day\u2019s previous settlement price or 5 minutes if the swing is more than 20%. Margin requirements \u2013 the amount of marginable securities that an investor must pay for with his/her own cash \u2013 have also been increased from 33% to 44%, a figure several times greater than that of other commodities like gold and oil. The minimum maintenance margin was also raised from 30% to 40%, specifically for Bitcoin, creating a premium for the futures.Kevin Kelly, managing partner of Benchmark Investments, offered his insight into the increase:One of the reasons why the futures margin requirements are so high is because of the limited size of the overall bitcoin market. There\u2019s a lack of depth and breadth.The initial announcement of Bitcoin futures was seen as a bullish sign for the digital currency, bringing with it mainstream recognition of the coin through association with traditional markets. It is being viewed as a way to ease Bitcoin towards wider financial industry acceptance, but doubters within both the Bitcoin and regulatory bodies still fear how traders could potentially manipulate prices despite the protections already set in place.Market Manipulation FearsAs some of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges face outages and DDOS attacks during intense periods of market action, it has lead to fears that both CBOE and CME, along with the regulators who approved the futures trading, have not considered the move carefully enough when it comes to potential market manipulation of Bitcoin\u2019s price. The Futures Industry Association (FIA) issued the following written statement;We remain apprehensive with the lack of transparency and regulation of the underlying reference products on which these futures contracts are based and whether exchanges have the proper oversight to ensure the reference products are not susceptible to manipulation, fraud, and operational risk.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released its own statement on December 1, in which Chairman Chris Giancarlo stated:Bitcoin is a commodity unlike any the commission has dealt with in the past. We expect that the futures exchanges, through information sharing agreements, will be monitoring the trading activity on the relevant cash platform.Whether that does enough to assure the fears and concern of Bitcoin investors and the wider financial community at large remains to be seen.Ty Gellasch, executive director of the Healthy Markets Association, warns:The CFTC has strong anti-manipulation rules for futures, but those won\u2019t necessarily protect investors if the bitcoin cash markets are manipulated.Will Bitcoin futures trading be good for the digital currency or is there simply too much potential market manipulation?

Co-founder of Avenue Capital Group and part owner of NBA team the Milwaukee Bucks, Marc Lasry expressed his regret at having missed the boat \u2013 at least the early one \u2013 when it comes to Bitcoin. The digital currency, which was trading at just below $1,000 at the beginning of 2017, has exploded over the last three months. In it\u2019s most dizzying ride yet, Bitcoin set \u2013 and shattered \u2013 several new all-time highs this week, climbing from around $12,000 to just over $18,000 in just days.A Prospective Investor\u2019s BlunderBitcoin first appeared on Lasry\u2019s radar a few years ago, when it was trading at around $300. Like many investors at the time, he didn\u2019t really pay much attention to it but that changed a few weeks ago when he took another look at the cryptocurrency and was surprised to see its price at between $9,000 and $10,000. Speaking to CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Lasry said:I wanted to start buying it personally when it hit around $9,000 or $10,000. Then I was like \u2026 \u2018I\u2019ll just wait for it to take a little dip.\u2019 And it hasn\u2019t taken a dip. \u2026 I should have bought that thing.He also weighed in on Bitcoin\u2019s recent meteoric price surge:The reason you\u2019re seeing this huge run-up over the course of the last couple of weeks is \u2026 it\u2019s coming into the mainstream.Lasry\u2019s comments were in reference to recent announcements by CBOE and CME Group about plans to roll out Bitcoin futures trading this month, while Nasdaq plans to do the same sometime in the first half of 2018.Bitcoin Not a FraudMarc Lasry also voiced his opinion on the raging debate over Bitcoin\u2019s legitimacy, telling CNBC that, while he admittedly doesn\u2019t understand it, he does believe that it is real. This is in direct contrast to that of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who has repeatedly labeled Bitcoin a fraud and suitable only for drug dealers, murderers, and \u201cstuff like that\u201c. Of course, this is the same Jamie Dimon whose company was recently busted in Switzerland for \u2013 wait for it \u2013 money laundering.A Looming Bubble, Or Greater Prospects Ahead?The rapid surge in Bitcoin\u2019s growth has raised concerns over a looming bubble. However, some experts, including former JP Morgan Director Tom Lee, think that its value will continue to soar in the coming years and may reach as much as $55,000 in five years. Do you feel Marc Lasry\u2019s pain? Did you \u2018miss the boat\u2019 when Bitcoin was $300 or less per coin?

British Spy Agency to Review Potential Bitcoin Risks Jeff Francis | Dec 10, 2017 | 03:45 Share Tweet Send Share The UK is calling upon its spy agency, the GCHQ, to review the potential risks that Bitcoin can bring and share that information with other government departments.When one thinks of British spies, James Bond comes to mind. The swaggering superspy is known for regularly thwarting villains bent on world domination, all the while enjoying a nice vodka martini and the attention of beautiful women. However, the real world is far different as intelligence agencies often deal with highly technical, tedious matters. Sadly, James Bond isn\u2019t going to burst into the lair of some Bitcoin villain any time soon, but the UK government is tasking its spy agency to review the risks associated with Bitcoin.Shaken, Not StirredThe spy agency tasked with probing potential Bitcoin risks is the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is an arm of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). The GCHQ is tasked with providing signals intelligence and information assurance to the UK government and its armed forces.The deputy director for cyber skills and growth at the NCSC, Chris Ensor, recently told The Telegraph that:We are interested in anything that could affect the country, so Bitcoin is a major thing now.At the behest of the UK Treasury, the NCSC is examining how the cryptocurrency works, with a particular emphasis upon the potential benefits of the underlying blockchain technology. The agency is bringing in experts (mathematicians, academics, and industry professionals) to help civil servants in the UK government understand the burgeoning cryptocurrency field.From Bitcoin with LoveThe reason why the UK government is having the NCSC investigate Bitcoin is that it is concerned about the potential risks associated with the cryptocurrency. The recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price has led to government authorities to begin fretting about the unregulated nature of the digital currency.The Doughnut \u2013 Home of the GCHQThe UK is considering a crackdown on Bitcoin through regulations. Currently, there are no regulations in the UK for Bitcoin exchanges or Bitcoin ATMs. That may change as the UK Treasury is suggesting changes to European money laundering rules that would require Bitcoin exchanges to know who their customers are. Chances are that regulations would also be enacted to require verification for a person to use a Bitcoin ATM.Of course, a primary reason why the National Cyber Security Centre is looking into Bitcoin likely has to do with tax evaders. It\u2019s no secret that many people shield their earnings by using cryptocurrency, which was clearly shown in the recent IRS lawsuit against Coinbase. You can bet that the UK Treasury wants to get their hands on some additional, and unreported, revenue.Like any massive bureaucratic entity, the UK government is being forced to play catch up with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This plodding approach is why so many people are flocking to digital currency to circumvent burdensome regulations and excessive taxes. Still, it is interesting that a spy agency is the one asked to look into Bitcoin, and it is pretty humorous that so much effort has to be made to explain cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to government bureaucrats.What do you think about the NCSC probing into the potential risks of Bitcoin? Does it make you think of thrilling car chases and exciting shootouts?

That all began to change in 2016, when the cyber security company FireEye began to note that North Korea began to target banks and the global financial system. 2017 has seen several attacks against South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, and this activity has since spread to banking groups in Europe and South Korea, Bitcoin exchanges, and even an ATM company.Independent security expert Ashley Shen notes:We assume one of the reasons why Bitcoin is being attacked is because the price keeps increasing and we think it\u2019s reasonable for hackers (to target). Digital currency might be easier to gain than physical currency. So I think it\u2019s reasonable.Security experts have followed attacks by various hacking groups, such as Andariel, Lazarus, and Bluenoroff, and these groups are suspected to be front groups for North Korea.Shen adds:Before when we tracked nation-state attackers, they usually perform cyber attacks which are aimed at confidential data and intelligence. However recently we\u2019ve discovered that some of the APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups are trying to hack financial institutions like banks and Bitcoin exchanges to gain financial profit.North Korea Needs MoneyWhile North Korea always seems to be up to some mischief, these ongoing attacks against Bitcoin exchanges is likely a sign of desperation. The country has been isolated due to crippling sanctions, and those sanctions were recently further enhanced by the Trump administration.In late November, the US government targeted 13 companies, 20 vessels, and 1 individual for engaging in trade with North Korea, At that time, US Treasure Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated:As North Korea continues to threaten international peace and security, we are steadfast in our determination to maximize economic pressure to isolate it from outside sources of trade and revenue while exposing its evasive tactics.Overall, the already meager North Korean economy has been crippled by economic sanctions. So it comes as no surprise that they wish to hack into Bitcoin exchanges in an effort to steal bitcoins as the cryptocurrency surges in value. Ashley Shen believes that such attacks are not going away any time soon, saying:My own opinion is they will probably keep doing the Bitcoins because the price keeps increasing and it\u2019s a good investment\u2026 So I assume they will do more Bitcoin attacks and of course they will keep targeting banks because that\u2019s what they did before.Are you worried about North Korea hacking into Bitcoin exchanges?

After boasting incredible YTD gains of over 1500% and a market cap rivaling that of most S&P 500 companies, the digital currency can no longer be ignored. Although businesses as a whole are slow to adopt Bitcoin, they are beginning to understand that \u2013 to quote Bob Dylan \u2013 the times, they are a-changin\u2019.According to Wall Street insiders, some banks and brokerages are going to be sweetening the year-end bonus pot, adding bitcoin along with the cash and deferred stock typically awarded to employees. It is a prospect that many risk-loving investors and tech-savvy pros are likely to welcome.Bob Graham, a digital currency expert at accounting and advisory firm Friedman, noted:The bitcoin bonus could be one of the methodologies in recruiting better talent into your organization.He added:We\u2019ve certainly gotten a lot of inquiries from hedge funds and other asset managers looking to understand cryptocurrency a little better, as they contemplate whether or not this is a good time to enter the marketplace.The idea of bitcoin bonuses isn\u2019t all that far-fetched. According to Aaron Kaplan, a securities attorney at Gusrae Kaplan Nusbaum, some venture funds are already offering their partners tokens tied to ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) as part of their compensation packages.Could Bitcoin Bonuses be Spurred by Oncoming Futures Trading?Beginning Sunday, December 10, the first bitcoin futures contract is expected to go into full swing after being launched by the Chicago Board Options Exchange. A week later, on December 18, the CME Group will be rolling out a similar futures contract of their own. There is also talk of Nasdaq doing the same sometime in the first half of 2018.This move by major US exchanges has given the digital currency a major boost, perhaps even encouraging more companies to adopt it as a payment option. The endorsement of the digital currency as a commodity type allows institutions and individuals to participate and accept it moving forward.New York commodities trader Dmitry Pichkar commented:We saw a tremendous boost in the bitcoin price once the CME came out and said it was opening up the futures contract. [\u2026] It was really kind of endorsing bitcoin as a type of commodity that people, including the institutions, will be able to participate in.And because of the growing prices, when employees receive their bitcoin bonuses they don\u2019t necessarily have to do the exchange to fiat currency right away. They could decide to hold (HODL!) and cash out when prices are higher.Do you believe that Bitcoin is finally starting to get the attention it deserves? If you were given a year-end bonus, would you want it in bitcoin or fiat currency? Let us know in the comments below.Images courtesy of Reuters, AdobeStock"}

Hint: It isn\u2019t the Money Cynthia Turcotte | Dec 10, 2017 | 14:30 Share Tweet Send Share With so many ICOs to choose from, and more launching nearly every day, how do you know which ones have the most potential? What makes an ICO successful?Okay, it\u2019s the money \u2013 at least in part. When it comes to the long-term success of an ICO, however, one critical factor is coin utility. If a coin has no purpose other than to be bought and sold on an exchange, there is no room for it to grow. There are hundreds of altcoins languishing on exchanges right now that can attest to that. Coin utility is a concept that is frequently bandied about by ICOs but is seldom understood or applied correctly. With over 900 ICOs currently underway, how do you separate the wheat from the chaff? Perhaps the most crucial filter is one that makes Bitcoin successful as a cryptocurrency, that of fungibility.Where Most ICOs Fall ShortMost ICOs have great marketing campaigns, good looking sites, even great business ideas. Where they fall short, however, is in identifying a clear path to demonstrating fungibility. This is cryptocurrency\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel and perhaps its biggest failure. Those cryptocurrencies that are able to demonstrate fungibility will emerge as leaders in the cryptocurrency space while the rest will go the way of the dinosaurs. This is why Bitcoin is experiencing record price hikes; because people can identify its fungibility and coin utility and therefore store of value and digital gold ideas emerge.So how does a coin attain fungibility, given that it marks the difference between success and failure? Fungibility is powered by coin utility \u2013 a coin\u2019s ability to be used in multiple places as payment or tender for services rendered. This is what makes the coin store value and act as a transferring or transacting agent. Very few altcoins have focused on this key feature. hoping that trading and novelty alone will be enough. Unsurprisingly, their value falls through the floor once listed on an exchange and then most of us are left wondering what just happened. A helium inflated balloon; fast deflated. Very few offerings ongoing currently have been able to distinguish themselves apart in this regard.A New FrontrunnerOne ICO that does manage to set itself apart in this manner is 4NEW. The entire business model of 4NEW is reverse engineered for coin utility and fungibility. The company has already raised over $30 Million USD in institutional funding from more traditional avenues in order to build a Waste to Energy plant and recently launched its crowdsale where they are seeking to raise $9.5 million. There are currently 6 days remaining until the end of their ICO.The Waste to Energy plant not only solves two significant social concerns, those of waste surplus and energy shortfall, but it also ensures the widespread adoption of FRNCoin (4NEW\u2019s cryptocurerncy). All future sales of the Waste to Energy plant will be transacted over the 4NEW blockchain, enabling the ability to make and accept timed payments between businesses. The FRNCoin will hit the ground running, with a strong foundation of demand already baked into the coin, which provides pricing stability and consistent liquidity in the coin.Like any successful cryptocurrency, 4NEW is seeing the swift adoption of, and demand for, its coin well in advance of the launch of its first plant. Beginning in 2018, FRNCoin is set to be accepted by business across several industries, including Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals, Health Insurance, Telecommunications, Credit Card processing and Money Transfer services. The addition of new businesses and industries is expected to continue at a feverish pace throughout the year. As 4NEW continues to add more business consumers, a Top-Down approach to widespread adoption and utilization will begin. Over time, adoption will permeate the masses, leading to another successful cryptocurrency very similar to Bitcoin.4NEW and BitcoinFundamentally speaking, the only real difference between Bitcoin and 4NEW is the coins\u2019 adoption approach. Whether by design or by happenstance, Bitcoin adoption has been a Bottom-UP process \u2013 a sort of grassroots movement where, by virtue of the people (the crypto community) adopting the coin, businesses find themselves having to adopt it as well in order to stay competitive. This strategy usually takes longer, however, it also given the community an awareness and wider acceptance of cryptocurrency today.Like Bitcoin, 4NEW will also act as a store of value over time, however, it utilizes the Top-Down approach to adoption. A market for the adoption of its FRNCoin is already being established across several industries so that, at the conclusion of the ICO, token holders will be able to use the coin as a means of payment. The credibility of this offering is further cemented by the company\u2019s recent affiliation with the Imperial College of London, a 110-year old academic institution with a pedigree track record.Nobody can guarantee the future performance of any token or ICO project, of course, but 4NEW has all the earmarks of becoming a lasting example for future success stories within the cryptocurrency community.Will a Top-Down approach to coin adoption pave the way for widespread consumer usage? Will it drive interest in ICOs that employ it? Let us know in the comments below.Images courtesy of AdobeStockThe Rundown Where Most ICOs Fall ShortA New Frontrunner4NEW and Bitcoin"}

This event was marked by the CBOE Global Markets\u2019 launch of Bitcoin futures contracts, on Sunday, December 10, 2017, opening the door to the cryptocurrency market for institutional investors\u2019 trillions of dollars. Moreover, Bitcoin futures has moved the rollout of Bitcoin ETFs one giant step closer to reality.Bitcoin Futures Could Bring Trillions into the Crypto MarketBitcoin made its debut in the world of mainstream finance under the symbol XBT. Many predict that this historic event will increase the number of participants and capital in the cryptocurrency market. For example, financial institutions and their vast amounts of dollars can now start trading Bitcoin. Institutional investors welcome the advent of futures because it provides a regulated framework for trading the cryptocurrency. Additionally, Bitcoin futures improve market efficiency.According to CBOE:[Bitcoin Futures] bring many benefits to traders, including transparency, efficient price discovery, deep liquidity and centralized clearing. XBTSM futures provide a centralized marketplace for participants to trade based on their view of bitcoin prices, gain exposure to bitcoin prices or hedge their existing bitcoin positions.Bitcoin\u2019s Derivatives Open Door to ETFsBitcoin is inherently volatile, and the advent of futures might further exacerbate volatility. In effect, hours before CBOE\u2019s launch of the futures contracts, the cryptocurrency market was jittery, as shown by the wild swings of Bitcoin\u2019s prices. Bitcoin\u2019s price dipped from over $18,000 USD on December 8, hitting low of around $13,000 USD on December 10, 2017, before swinging upward again to its current price of just over $15,000.Futures bring new dynamics into the ecosystem. For example, market regulators will increase their scrutiny. Additionally, traders can now short sell the cryptocurrency. Another potential ramification to consider is that because Bitcoin futures occur within a regulated environment, it could make it possible to obtain SEC approval for the rolling out of ETFs.Spencer Bogart, head of research for Blockchain Capital, told ETF.com:If you look at what the SEC said in its ETF disapproval from earlier this year, it essentially needed to see the underlying bitcoin spot market become more regulated, or it needed to see a fully functional derivatives ecosystem that is regulated.The launch of Bitcoin futures provides concrete evidence that the financial industry has finally accepted Bitcoin. Therefore, Bitcoin\u2019s bubble will now either burst, as many have forecast or, Bitcoin will flourish, offering financial institutions unimaginable investment opportunities.What do you think the impact of Bitcoin futures trading will have on the SEC\u2019s decision to allow Bitcoin ETFs?

While some media outlets undertake responsible journalism to understand what cryptocurrency is and why people are flocking to use it, other outlets prefer to tie Bitcoin to criminal gangs, drug purchases, and money laundering. The most recent example of this is the Daily Mail dubbing the owner of a Bitcoin ATM business in the United Kingdom the \u201cBitcoin Bandit.\u201dA Violent PastThe Daily Mail was quite breathless in their account of Landry Ntahe, the owner of a Bitcoin ATM company in the UK called BCB ATM. From their account, the company owns and operates 19 Bitcoin ATM machines in various cities throughout England. However, it\u2019s Ntahe\u2019s criminal past that draws the attention of the news outlet.From all accounts, Ntahe was sentenced to prison back in 2009 for his involvement in two violent robberies that saw the victims tortured. One of the victims had had his toes crushed with pliers whilst another had his teeth pulled out before having a metal pole rammed down his throat.Pretty horrific stuff, but Landry Ntahe says that he did not take part in the violence and was only the driver. At the time of his conviction, Ntahe was 20 years old and was sentenced to five years in prison, of which he served two-and-a-half. His partners in crime, Arnold Epono (age 20) and Ashley Edwards (age 21), were convicted on 12 counts of robbery, fraud, and false imprisonment. They received indeterminate sentences.Media Loves Linking Bitcoin to CrimeSince his release, Landry Ntahe seems to have cleaned up his act. He learned about Bitcoin from YouTube videos and started his company, BCB ATM, with loans from his family. When asked about his crimes, he told the Daily Mail:I was young, naive and ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. I\u2019ve learned a lot since then and it\u2019s given me further drive to make a success of life. I have gained a teaching qualification. I am now able to show others that you can get a second chance in life.While the history of Ntahe is pretty lurid, one could say that he\u2019s become a productive member of society and has steered away from a life of crime. Of course, the Daily Mail then goes into overdrive to link cryptocurrency to criminality.They note that the frenzy surrounding the price of Bitcoin has led to a lot of investors speculating on the cryptocurrency, thus leading to an increased demand for easy access to it. They note that Bitcoin ATMs do not have to be registered in the UK, which, naturally leads to fears of Bitcoin being the \u201ccurrency of choice of criminals.\u201d The news outlet notes that payments can be made across borders to \u201ccriminal associates,\u201d who can withdraw the money or use it on the DARK WEB!The Daily Mail goes on to say that many of the 12 firms operating Bitcoin ATMs in the UK appear to not have any offices or have registered with the Companies House. They also note that many of the businesses only have a mobile phone number on their website. Of course, the most damning bit of information is that one of the ATMs owned by BCB ATM is located in a cannabis store! (Gasp!)When pressed about the possibility of illegal activity associated with Bitcoin, Ntahe said:People use bitcoin ATMs for various reasons, and sadly a minority of people do use it for unlawful purposes, like money laundering. As an industry, we must do more to make bitcoin secure and safer to use.Overall, the crimes associated with Landry Ntahe are bad, and I\u2019m not sugarcoating that. Yet it does appear that he has turned his life around, but the media just can\u2019t help themselves at times to paint all of cryptocurrency with a criminal brush.Could Bitcoin be used for bad things? Of course. But the same could be said for gold and fiat currency. I think a lot more dollars are spent on drugs in a single large city than Bitcoin for the same purpose in its entirety. It\u2019s actually quite humorous to read such overly dramatic pearl-clutching about Bitcoin, but the sad reality is that many people will take such hack journalism as gospel.Do you think Landry Ntahe has paid his debt to society and be allowed to operate Bitcoin ATMs?

Over $35 billion changed hands across all assets in the past 24 hours, the figure nearly an all-time high of its own and far above volumes seen just weeks ago. Bitcoin also continues to retain its above-50% market cap dominance, hovering at around 60% despite challenges imposed by both Ethereum and more recently the Bitcoin Cash hard fork. Nonetheless, as one commentator noted Tuesday, with a then market cap of $291 billion, Bitcoin still represents a fraction of the cash stashed in other asset classes, leading to potentially \u201cunprecedented\u201d upside.At $291,000,000,000 #Bitcoin is only just approaching 0.1% of the value invested in all other major asset classes.Long term the upside is still unprecedented. pic.twitter.com/URiB9uAlGu\u2014 RenegadeinvestorUK (@sharkybit) December 12, 2017Prices look to be on course to hit $20,000 a coin in the near term after volatility appeared to slow following the launch of CBOE\u2019s pioneering Bitcoin futures contracts last weekend.What do you think about the growth of cryptocurrency\u2019s market cap?

Some have unique features that other coins don\u2019t, and most definitely have a niche that they fulfill.Altcoins and ShitcoinsBitcoin is the clear leader in the cryptocurrency markets. It still holds its first mover advantage, retains around 60% of the total digital currency market cap, and much of the industry is still based around it. Most altcoins are even priced in Bitcoin. But, against what many people shout about on Reddit, not every altcoin is a \u201cshitcoin.\u201d Many have solid technology, a brilliant team behind the project, and a thriving community dedicated to making their coin the best that they can. This article will go into some of the other popular cryptos and what makes them unique and interesting.LitecoinMany people refer to Litecoin as the \u201cDigital Silver\u201d to Bitcoin\u2019s \u201cDigital Gold.\u201d Litecoin works very much like Bitcoin, as its looking to act as a currency as well. It has a few key differences though. Bitcoin\u2019s protocol dictates that, on average, one block of transactions is broadcasted to the network every ten minutes. This means that the best-case scenario is that your transaction will be confirmed ten minutes after you submit it, even then that\u2019s providing you\u2019ve included a proper fee.With Litecoin, the average block time is two and a half minutes. This provides much faster confirmations, along with the fact that, at scale, it can process four times more transactions per second than Bitcoin. Only time will tell if Litecoin will solve many of the problems facing Bitcoin if the Litecoin network experiences the same influx of users Bitcoin has seen in recent months.MoneroMonero is yet another coin that acts as a currency, but it does have one major difference that makes it attractive to investors. Many claims that Bitcoin is a fully anonymous network, but that is unfortunately not true. Seeing how Bitcoin is a completely public and auditable ledger, someone could theoretically trace every single bitcoin you own back to the original block it was mined in. Addresses can be linked together. So, for example, if you signed up for an exchange and bought some bitcoins, those coins would be associated with that address and that address would be associated with your identity. And it would make sense that if you send the coins completely from the exchange to another address, one could assume that you control that address as well.Monero solves this problem with something called \u201cConfidential Transactions (CT).\u201d These transaction types make is so that it is impossible to trace coins, or see how many Monero any one address holds. The problem with CTs is that these types of transactions take up much more physical bytes than traditional transactions, sometimes as large as four times the size of traditional transactions. This results in four times fewer transactions per seconds versus Bitcoin. Work is being done on CTs to reduce the size of transactions, and this functionality could one day be implemented in other coins as well.EthereumEthereum is the second most popular by market cap, and for good reason too. Its native currency token is called \u201cether.\u201d Fundamentally, Ethereum works the same as Bitcoin but it has a different purpose. Whereas Bitcoin aims to be a payment platform and a currency, Ethereum looks to be what is known as a \u201csmart contract platform.\u201d Those are complicated sounding words, but it\u2019s not that crazy. A smart contract is just a piece of code that can be audited by all parties involved, and once executed cannot be altered. The fact that it is hardcoded means that anyone who can understand the programming language can look at in and independently verify that the contract will do what it says it\u2019s going to do.My favorite example is the YouTube ad revenue example. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m a content creator on YouTube, and you come to me with a short advertisement to put at the beginning of my videos. You tell me you\u2019ll give me $10 for every thousand views my video receives. Without a smart contract, I\u2019d have to either trust you to give me the money or we get a third party involved that will ensure you pay me.We could create a smart contract that will automatically pay me once the view threshold is reached. You\u2019d deposit a certain amount of money in an escrow wallet that is controlled by the contract. The contract would check the YouTube API every so often to find the view count, and pay me accordingly. Any money left in the contract address at the end of the agreement would be returned to you. This is a very basic example, but the possibilities are endless. Some of you may have heard of the CryptoKitties drama happening with Ethereum right now. That game is just a smart contract someone made and launched on the Ethereum network.Full Disclosure: The author owns Litecoin. This article is in no way meant to be investment advice.

Is the Bubble Ready to Burst?The cryptocurrency market had a phenomenal bull run this year. As the cryptocurrency industry is constantly improving and innovating, many finance experts believe that the hype behind it is just speculation. Experts believe that the global cryptocurrency market may be in a bubble state, and it might burst any moment. But many cryptocurrency experts are still optimistic and believe that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still undervalued. The Winklevoss twins recently stated that Bitcoin is still to undervalued. Global regulators have started warning investors from cryptocurrencies and potential fraudulent ICOs.SEC Warns Cryptocurrency InvestorsThe US Security and Exchange Commision (SEC) has issued a new statement regarding its stance on cryptocurrencies and token sales. The SEC\u2019s public announcement mainly focused on cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings. The announcement strongly advises investors to be more careful with their cryptocurrency investments, as the market is still unregulated and doesn\u2019t offer the same securities as traditional investment markets offer. The report also noted that entrepreneurs that plan to host an ICO should implement the proper securities regulations by the SEC. SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, stated following in the report:Investors should understand that to date no initial coin offerings have been registered with the SEC. The SEC also has not to date approved for listing and trading any exchange-traded products (such as ETFs) holding cryptocurrencies or other assets related to cryptocurrencies.[2] If any person today tells you otherwise, be especially wary.He also added:I believe that initial coin offerings \u2013 whether they represent offerings of securities or not \u2013 can be effective ways for entrepreneurs and others to raise funding, including for innovative projects. However, any such activity that involves an offering of securities must be accompanied by the important disclosures, processes and other investor protections that our securities laws require. A change in the structure of a securities offering does not change the fundamental point that when a security is being offered, our securities laws must be followed.[4] Said another way, replacing a traditional corporate interest recorded in a central ledger with an enterprise interest recorded through a blockchain entry on a distributed ledger may change the form of the transaction, but it does not change the substance.The SEC\u2019s mains concerns are centered around fraudulent ICOs and token sales that promise unrealistic profits for investors. Recently, the special SEC cyber team managed to shut down a fraudulent token sale before it could start collecting money from unsuspecting investors.What are your thoughts on SEC\u2019s new announcement?

The cryptocurrency has exploded in value since the start of the year, and major financial institutions have finally leapt on board the bandwagon, such as the launch of Bitcoin futures trading. This increasing acceptance and acknowledgement of Bitcoin can also be seen in popular culture, mainly through mainstream media TV programming.What, No Bitcoin Sitcom?We\u2019ve had three recent occasions where Bitcoin showed up in popular culture. One was on the Howard Stern radio show where the shock jock\u2019s sidekick, Robin Quivers, brought up the cryptocurrency. To nobody\u2019s surprise, Howard Stern had no real idea what Bitcoin is, but the fact that it was a topic of conversation exposed millions of listeners to Bitcoin.The digital currency also popped up in the opening for Saturday Night Live. In the SNL skit, a store Santa (Kenan Thompson) and his elf helper (Kate McKinnon ) are asked a number of topical questions by young children, leaving them flustered. When a girl asks for everything to be okay, McKinnon says that that, eventually, the country will be fixed by good people. To which, the littler girl replies, \u201cOkay, good. But just in case, I\u2019m putting all my money in Bitcoin.\u201d Of course, the biggest Bitcoin pop culture appearance so far has been on The Big Bang Theory. An entire episode revolved around the cryptocurrency as the group, realizing how much Bitcoin was now worth, went on a quest to find the laptop that they had used to mine the currency way back in 2011. A funny tidbit was that the price of Bitcoin had doubled to what the TV program showed due to the episode being filmed weeks before.Tonight\u2019s Special Guest Star: BitcoinWhile the two TV examples above are very recent, Bitcoin has popped up a number of times over the last couple of years during primetime. The cryptocurrency has made a couple of, albeit very brief, appearances on The Simpsons. Other shows that have mentioned Bitcoin include: Parks and Recreation, Almost Human (man, I loved this show), Supernatural, Person of Interest, House of Cards, Family Guy, and NCIS: LA. The Good Wife had an entire episode in 2012 based around Bitcoin. In the episode, the US Treasury Department is going after a lawyer who won\u2019t reveal the identity of his client, who is supposedly the creator of Bitcoin. The US government feels that the digital currency is in competition with the dollar. Frustrated by a judge\u2019s ruling, the Treasury Department then charges the lawyer as being the Bitcoin creator.While still paltry in number, Bitcoin does keep creeping into popular culture through mainstream media. Quite a few depictions of Bitcoin are not terribly accurate, as it\u2019s clearly evident that the writers are not well-versed in the crypto world. (They just seem to love bringing up the Dark Web as a plot device.)Yet as Bitcoin becomes more accepted and known by the general public, then the likelihood of seeing a more realistic depiction of Bitcoin on TV and in the movies is probably pretty decent. As Bitcoin continues to rise in value, chances are that the cryptocurrency will be making a lot more guest appearances on a TV show. While Bitcoin has not conquered popular culture, it is making some siginficant inroads.Do you think Bitcoin is breaking into popular culture?

Digital wallet company Coinbase just announced on its status page, here, that as of 11:04 PST, Ethereum buys and sells are temporarily disabled. At the same time, the company is reporting that Litecoin buys and sells are temporarily disabled, although this news is delivered by way of a yellow notification bar at the top of a user\u2019s screen when accessing the Coinbase platform, as opposed to through its official status page, as illustrated by the Tweet below (courtesy of user @CryptoRedPill):I don't use @coinbase but come on\u2026.. You can't just block people from selling when the price is high like some shady brokerage firm from the 80s. Unacceptable. pic.twitter.com/nVC4cbZOtc\u2014 Morpheus (@CryptoRedPill) December 12, 2017As of right now, the exact reason behind the trading halt is unclear. However, it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that the move comes as a direct result of the dramatic increase in price (and, at the same time, volume) in both of the affected cryptocurrencies over the last twenty-four hours or so.An Unmanageable Influx of VolumeAs reported by CoinMarketCap, Ethereum did close to 270,000 BTC in volume over the last twenty-four hours (more than $4.7 billion), while Litecoin saw volume of just shy of 445,000 BTC (around $7.775 billion) across the same period.Reuters is suggesting that there may be some form of DDOS at the root of the problem, although this seems second in probability to an increased transaction demand based on the increase in volume outlined above.GDAX is reporting a degraded performance on the Ethereum network but looks to be fully operational on its Litecoin network.An Inherent Issue With ScaleThat these sorts of issues arise when we see a dramatic increase in volume, be it on the buy or the sell side, for any cryptocoin, is not surprising. The shift towards mainstream adoption is well underway and the companies that are facilitating this shift (such as Coinbase) are also tasked with supporting it \u2013 a far from simple task.The response of users of Coinbase, however, will be rooted in the way that the company responds to these issues arising. If Litecoin and Ethereum trading return to normal near term (and there looks to be no indication right now that it won\u2019t, although of course, we can\u2019t say that for certain), the impact of this development on sentiment will likely be minimal. If the issues persist, however, and we see the news filter through to the more mainstream media outlets (as we are starting to do already), we could see bitcoin correct as the more risk-averse holders convert to fiat or pull their holdings off major exchanges to mitigate exposure risk.Do you use Coinbase?

Jinia Shawdagor | Dec 12, 2017 | 12:15 Share Tweet Send Share Once upon a time, it would have been absurd to compare bitcoin to gold. One was a new cryptocurrency with little to no adoption, and the other was a precious metal and one-time backer of world currencies. The ensuing years have seen Bitcoin grow to become one of the most precious stores of value, even surpassing that of gold.After nearly two decades of trading in the $350 \u2013 $500 range, in 2002 gold bottomed and it took nine years for it to make a comeback, reaching a record high of around $1900 in September of 2011. It was a slow but respectable gain of over 550% but over time, the commodity has given up a significant portion of the gains. By contrast, at the time of this writing, Bitcoin, has recorded gains of nearly 12,000% in less than a third of the time.In 2011, investors were abandoning their gilded ship in droves. The hard money camp were the only ones who still believed in gold as a currency, while the masses refused to view or treat it as such. As a result, even hard money supporters began to dwindle. The \u201cTop-Down\u201d path to gold being adopted as a currency ultimately failed because there was no support at the \u201cbottom\u201d (the masses).Bitcoin, on the other hand, is experiencing a \u201cBottom-Up\u201d adoption route. It already has large-scale support among the masses (the \u201cbottom\u201d) and that support has started to spread upward, to businesses, the financial sector, and even some governments.What Does this Mean for the Precious Metal?The declining performance of gold since it hit its record high in 2011 hasn\u2019t been a good sign. The precious metal stands no chance, at least in terms of mass perception. Many people view it purely as an ancient relic that has no place in today\u2019s modern monetary system.Even in India, where gold consumption is second only to China, the demand for gold is falling. According to the World Gold Council, India\u2019s gold consumption in Q3 of 2017 dropped by 24% compared to the previous year and Q4 is likely to see a similar drop, bringing gold consumption in the country to its lowest point in eight years.While the price of gold has inched a little higher from its 5-month low ahead of this week\u2019s meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve, overall demand continues to decline. The Bitcoin market, on the other hand, is expected to continue to grow \u2013 especially with the recent addition of bitcoin futures trading to the mainstream financial sector. Given these factors, it is entirely possible that Bitcoin will succeed where gold has failed and go on to be accepted and treated as a currency.Do you think Bitcoin will ever be accepted as a currency? Will the gold market ever recover even a portion of its former glory? Let us know in the comments below.Images courtesy of Fotolia, Shutterstock"}

More and more global financial firms are becoming active in the crypto world, but not everybody is feeling the love for Bitcoin. One such person is the governor of Australia\u2019s central bank, who recently labeled the surging interest in virtual currencies as \u201cspeculative mania.\u201d Bitcoin? Bah, Humbug!The governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), Philip Lowe, gave a speech where he said that it was hard for him to envision people using Bitcoin in normal, everyday transactions. He expressed:The value of bitcoin is very volatile, the number of payments that can currently be handled is very low, there are governance problems, the transaction cost involved in making a payment with bitcoin is very high and the estimates of the electricity used in the process of mining the coins are staggering.The view outlined by Philip Lowe echoes that of the governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Grant Spencer, who said:I think a cryptocurrency that has a more stable value will be the sort of cryptocurrency that is more useful for the future. I think they are part of the future. But not the sort that we see in bitcoin.The reasons for the opinions of Philip Lowe and Grant Spencer is that Bitcoin has shown a good deal of volatility on an almost daily basis, something that most financial experts are leery of. It\u2019s also noted that only a handful of brick-and-mortar retailers actually accept Bitcoin directly as a payment.Are Electronic Dollars in the Future?While not thrilled with Bitcoin, Lowe is actually pretty keen on blockchain technology and its use as a basis for an electronic dollar issued by the Reserve Bank of Australia. He believes that such an electronic dollar would be more efficient and have a lower cost for payments and business processing.He said:It is possible that the RBA might, in time, issue a new form of digital money \u2013 a variation on exchange settlement accounts \u2013 perhaps using distributed ledger technology.Lowe believes that such an electronic dollar would be popular as people, in times of crisis, would rather have currency that has a central entity backing it as opposed to privately issued currency.Overall, it\u2019s likely that banks and governments might start to consider introducing nationally-backed cryptocurrencies in order to retain control of their economies.Philip Lowe of the RAB concludes his thoughts on Bitcoin with the following:When thought of purely as a payment instrument, it seems more likely to be attractive to those who want to make transactions in the black or illegal economy, rather than everyday transactions.So, the current fascination with these currencies feels more like a speculative mania than it has to do with their use as an efficient and convenient form of electronic payment.Do you agree or not with the opinion of Philip Lowe that the current Bitcoin frenzy is a speculative mania?

Bitcoin has experienced a couple of days of relative calm, climbing only a few hundred dollars this time from $16,500 to $16,800, where it currently trades. Many are beginning to question where the great impetus comes from and what is actually pushing these prices ever higher.According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, traders in Asia are responsible for a lot of the price action we have been witnessing in recent months. A research firm called CryptoCompare claimed that Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam were responsible for 80% of the total trade volume at the end of last month.Crypto KoreansSouth Korea even surpassed the US at one stage last week as transactions skyrocketed; this is no mean feat since the country only has a population of 51.25 million. It has been estimated that South Korea accounts for a quarter of the global trade in BTC and LTC. Regular citizens are getting in on the action, and demand has sent prices through the roof. Rates for Bitcoin can vary greatly, with some Asian exchanges quoting up to $25,000 for the digital asset; in the US, it has yet to break $19,000.The current crypto craze is unprecedented in that it is individuals and retail traders pushing up the prices whereas, historically, it has been the institutional big boys that make the first moves. Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG Group, told the WSJ:It feels like this whole thing is being driven by the average Joe who isn\u2019t nearly as financially literate as a professional fund manager.End of the Party?News that the government in South Korea may issue prohibitions on Bitcoin trading, futures contracts, and an outright ban on ICOs will no doubt affect participation levels. China was once the leading country for crypto trading, being responsible for over 65% of all the Bitcoin issued on a given day. Mega factories in the People\u2019s Republic still churn out as much as 80% of the global supply of Bitcoin as it has become virtually impossible for individuals to mine it.India is also taking a stronger stance with central banks there issuing more warnings about crypto trading this week. Vietnam banned Bitcoin entirely at the end of October, and clampdowns followed in Indonesia last week. Nations of Asia are generally a lot more autocratic than those in the West; control is more important than financial freedom. For now though, traders in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand can still get in on the crypto craze.Will clampdowns in South Korea affect the Bitcoin markets?

With Litecoin surging to all-time highs of over $340 yesterday and Ethereum making similar moves a few hours ago reaching $660, we are left wondering which coin will be next.Those \u2018hodling\u2019 XRP may have been getting that sinking feeling that crypto mania has left them behind. Having recently been relegated from its fourth position in the coin market capacity league by LTC, Ripple has been waiting for a resurgence.Crypto TorporXRP has been pretty much inactive for the past half a year. The last time it made any serious moves was back in May when it reached $0.40. May was the Big Bang for crypto with all of them inflating into the universe at the same time. Since then, Ripple has slowly sunk back towards the $0.22 level, where it has been languishing for months. Small movements up to around $0.27 were about all the excitement we could expect out of this altcoin \u2026 until now.Bank BoostAccording to a report in the Nikkei Asian Review, banks in Japan and South Korea will begin testing blockchain technology from the San Francisco fintech firm this Friday. The goal is to achieve same-day international fund transfers while cutting costs by 30%. SBI Ripple Asia leads a group of 61 Japanese banks that will be at the forefront of the trials. Seoul-based provider of blockchain solutions, DAYLI Intelligence, will handle the South Korean side. If successful, the Ripple blockchain could be facilitating fund transfers between Japan and South Korea as early as spring next year. Using XRP to send funds could save the banks and their clients up to 60% when compared to conventional methods.The Dragon AwakesThe price reaction to XRP was quite dramatic. The dragon finally awoke and headed up towards the key resistance level of $0.30, which was tested, then broke at 20.00 UTC. From there, the only way was skyward, and the next couple of hours saw the coin head to an all-time high of $0.43, according to CoinMarketCap.The market has since corrected, and XRP was trading at $0.39 at the time of writing, up 46% in the past 24 hours. The crypto firm decided to put 55 billion XRP in escrow last week to keep prices under control, releasing it slowly as needed. Many crypto traders have been wary of Ripple due to its close ties with the banking industry, but those that have been \u2018hodling\u2019 have finally got some rewards.What are your thoughts on Ripple: as good as any crypto or too close to the banks?

Last week saw Bitcoin race from $14,000 to over $18,000 in a few hours before coming back down to earth at just over $15,000. While many financial experts are predicting that Bitcoin will soar even higher in 2018, there are a number who are a little more gloomy. The latest member of the Gloom Club is Torsten Slok, an economist with Deutsche Bank, who believes that a Bitcoin crash could endanger global markets.Bitcoin Making the List \u2026 of Market RisksBitcoin has been riding high this year, and the launch of futures trading is driving interest to a fever pitch. The CBOE website actually crashed yesterday as it couldn\u2019t handle the massive influx of traffic. One wonders if CME will beef up their site when they launch their own Bitcoin futures exchange next week.Of course, not everyone is tickled pink by the increasing influence of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Torsten Slok of Deutsche Bank has issued a warning about the ramifications of a Bitcoin crash in 2018. Slok released a list of 30 market risks that could impact global markets, and a Bitcoin crash came in at lucky number 13. This places Bitcoin behind German wages and inflation but ahead of Brexit developments and the Russian presidential election.How Bad Would a Bitcoin Crash Be?A total Bitcoin crash would be devastating to a lot of people, but it may not have the global impact that Torsten Slok envisions. One such reason not to fret is that of scale. The total market cap for all cryptocurrencies is $436 billion at the time of this article\u2019s writing. While a tremendous amount of money, it does pale in comparison to other economic factors. The housing market in the United States alone was estimated to be almost $30 trillion back in 2016. Another example of scale is that the value of all Japanese stocks hit a high of $5.49 trillion back in September.Another reason why not to panic is that Bitcoin is spread across the world and not concentrated in a single economic block, such as Europe. A lot of people would lose a great deal of money in the event of a Bitcoin crash, but it should not throw a wrecking ball at a single country\u2019s economy. However, if a Bitcoin crash was part and parcel of a greater financial breakdown across multiple markets, then the overall global market would be impacted.That being said, a Bitcoin crash would hurt a lot of individuals, but I wonder if a lot of national governments would welcome such an occurrence. There\u2019s no denying that many governments are not too keen on cryptocurrency as it is currency that lies outside their control, and governments are not thrilled with a lack of control.As for Deutsche Bank, they\u2019re calling for greater regulation and security on cryptocurrency in order to make it a viable asset class. The bank believes that the imbalance between supply and demand, as well as the volatility of crypto prices, make investing in digital currencies risky. Deutsche Bank says:If cryptocurrencies are to replace money, then they have to fulfill money\u2019s three core functions: as medium of exchange, a measure of value and a store of value. To do this, cryptocurrencies must be more trusted. Problems here include high volatility and possible price manipulation as well as data loss or data theft.In the image below are the 30 global market risks as selected by Torsten Slok of Deutsche Bank.

Many people \u201cGoogle\u201d information, and those looking to sell stuff online \u201ceBay\u201d it. The dominant online auction site, which boasts a market cap of $39.2 billion may make the wish of crypto enthusiasts come true as they are considering accepting Bitcoin as a payment option.Auction or Buy It NowIn an interview with Yahoo Finance, the senior vice president of eBay Americas, Scott Cutler, said that the online auction site was \u201cseriously considering\u201d accepting the digital currency. However, before everyone starts to celebrate, Cutler went on to add that \u201cwe\u2019re not quite there yet.\u201dThis would be a huge development if one of the web\u2019s biggest sales sites would accept Bitcoin. As of now, eBay does not accept any cryptocurrency as a payment option. It currently takes PayPal, credit cards, and debit cards. Making the move to accept Bitcoin would expand eBay\u2019s potential revenue to a pretty large degree as the total market cap for Bitcoin is a cool $284.5 billion, according to Coinmarketcap.Would Bitcoin Get Good Feedback?As of now, people can buy and sell cryptocurrency on eBay, along with mining contracts and mining equipment. However, there are some caveats to remember. First is that cryptocurrency is sold via the site\u2019s classified ad system. This means that you can\u2019t partake of the feedback system or the eBay Money Back Guarantee feature.If you purchase virtual currency from an eBay seller, the reality is that you\u2019re on your own. PayPal and eBay will not refund your money if you\u2019re scammed due to the cryptocurrency being a virtual asset, which means that there\u2019s no tangible proof, such as a post office receipt, of a physical good being shipped and received. This has led to a lot of scams, which just reinforces the old adage of \u201cbuyer beware.\u201dBitcoin Could Drive Sellers AwayAccepting Bitcoin could be a risk for eBay though. While Overstock saw its value rise after deciding to accept Bitcoin, Steam had to abandon taking the virtual currency due to its wild fluctuations in value.It\u2019s this volatility that makes Bitcoin an interesting dilemma for eBay. A lot of sellers exist on a very small profit margin as eBay has upped the fees over the years, such as adding a 10% charge on the shipping costs. As someone who has sold on eBay for 18 years, I can say quite a few sellers would be leery of accepting Bitcoin due to the potential of the currency dropping in value, not to mention the costs associated with converting it into fiat currency.The reality is that eBay itself is sheltered from such up-or-down fluctuations as they invoice the sellers in cold, hard cash. If eBay forces sellers to accept Bitcoin, and the price suddenly drops 20%, eBay isn\u2019t hurt at all as they\u2019re still charging the seller the same fee amount they did before. By contrast, the seller just lost 20% of their sale, not to mention the added insult of having to pay fees on the higher value amount. A modest profit could turn into a loss in the blink of an eye. Plus, the costs of converting the cryptocurrency would be way too high for the standard small amounts that most items on the auction site go for.In the end, eBay could increase their revenue by accepting Bitcoin, but the problem is ensuring that the sellers, on whom eBay depends, don\u2019t take a bath in the process. Currently, there\u2019s no quick and easy solution, but we\u2019ll see what eBay comes up with.Do you think eBay will eventually start accepting Bitcoin? What would be the best way to implement such a policy?

Nations of the Middle East, however, are also eager to take a ride on the digital train and Dubai, in particular, is witnessing a boom in crypto trading.Young professionals are taking to cryptocurrencies in droves, all eager to invest for the future and profit from the recent price surges. Bitcoin has had a wild ride over the past week or so, starting out last Monday at just over $11,000. From there, to coin a phrase from crypto groups on social media, it shot for the moon and reached an all-time peak of $18,200 late Friday.Talk of bubbles and the imminent launch of futures contracts by the Chicago Board Options Exchange on Sunday caused 25% to be shaved off of Bitcoin\u2019s price in just 48 hours. It has since rallied, as Bitcoin is wont to do, and is trading at $16,700 at the time of writing. Savvy investors in Dubai have been doing their homework and a number of them, including trader Ibrahim Barbor, got in at the sweet spot in February when BTC was priced around $1,100.Barbo has joined leagues of people across the Middle East who believe in cryptocurrencies and their potential for being better than cash backed and controlled by a central bank. In an interview with Arab News, he said: \u201cI liked what it had to offer. You\u2019re in complete control of what you own, there is a limited supply of it so you can\u2019t just print your way out of it like a government, and its value had been increasing for a while. So I said why not?Dubai-based investors tech company ArabianChain founder, Mohammed Alsehli, got in at an even better time \u2013 way back in 2011 when the average price of a Bitcoin was a paltry $7. He has also become disillusioned by traditional currencies and banking, saying:Today, currency is just backed by debt, that\u2019s it. There is a little bit of a gold rush going on, but it\u2019s also justifiable, especially when it comes to bitcoin.Dubai-based bitcoin trader BitOasis has reported a spike in interest that has slowed down its verification routines. BitOasis is a leading digital asset wallet and exchange across the Middle East and North Africa. Due to the sheer volume of new account applications, the website states that it now takes up to seven working days to process account verification requests. In addition to Dubai, the exchange operates in UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Saudi Arabia.Regional central banks and governments are generally wary of things they cannot control and so have issued advisories against cryptocurrencies. However, those in the know remain optimistic about its future and that crypto is here to stay.How do you think the Middle Eastern governments will ultimately handle the cryptocurrency?

James Levenson | Dec 11, 2017 | 05:00 Share Tweet Send Share The probability of a price action movement caused by the sale of a large quantity of Bitcoin will increase as long as its price continues to go up. As the digital currency gains popularity and rolls towards mainstream acceptance, smaller investors need to be aware that a large number of Bitcoin is owned by a very small number of people.According to Bloomberg, as much as 40% of the total supply of Bitcoin, currently 16.7 million coins, is owned by around a thousand people. This means that each one of them could hold over 6,700 Bitcoins, which at current value would be worth a staggering $110 million each. As the price continues ever skywards, there is a greater chance that some of them will want to cash out and take their profit. It is also highly likely that they acquired their cryptocurrency when it was worth a fraction of its current value, which is even more reason to sell some.Are the Whales Colluding?Bitcoin was created and developed by a small, tight-knit community of technology gurus and entrepreneurs. Satoshi Nakamoto remains anonymous, giving even more weight to the notion of a group of people controlling a substantial stash of it, having got in way back when BTC was worth a couple of dollars.It is possible that these Bitcoin whales know each other and could possibly coordinate their selling strategies so as to maximize profits. When Roger Ver was asked about if Bitcoin whales could work together in such a regard, he told Bloomberg:I suspect that is likely true, and people should be able to do whatever they want with their own money. I\u2019ve personally never had time for things like that though.Basis for Manipulation FearsDue to the nature of Bitcoin being a currency and not a security, there is no regulation which prohibits trading as a group to manipulate market prices. In fact, it already happens with altcoins where groups select ones that are actively hyped on social media, such as Reddit, Facebook groups, and exchange \u2018trollboxes.\u2019 The result is a pump and dump, a falsely induced price spike which encourages others to get on board for fear of missing out (FOMO), and then the consequent sell-off, which dumps the asset value back to what it was previously.Ethereum faces a similar ownership issue, with creator Vitalik Buterin reportedly holding around 525,000 ETH with a current market value of around $240 million. Co-founder of crypto hedge fund Tetras Capital, Alex Sunnarborg, claims that the top 100 Bitcoin addresses control 17.3% of all the issued currency and that the top 100 Ethereum addresses control 40% of the entire supply.Market domination by a minority of whales is nothing new, though. The banking sector has seen similar action for decades, as the bigwigs at the top grow fatter at the expense of the majority. With cryptocurrencies, though, it may be less likely as the founders and big holders are more ideologically oriented, which, in theory, makes them less likely to manipulate markets for their own gain.Are you concerned about the possibility of crypto whales manipulating the markets?

It broke all previous highs late Friday as it reached the lofty peak of $18,353. The bears came out on Sunday and forced the price back down over 27% to $13,315. However, it has since recovered and is currently trading at $16,790 at the time of writing.Litecoin Shines BrightWhen Bitcoin volatility is at its greatest, altcoins usually take a beating when funds flow out of them and back into the daddy of cryptos as traders try to maximize short-term profits. Over the last few days, though, one coin has shone brighter than the rest and maintained almost 60% gains on its price at the end of last week. Litecoin saw an almost vertical jump from its stable price of $95-$100, which it first hit on November 29th, to over $160 on Friday and into Saturday\u2019s trading session.A market correction usually follows these crypto spikes, and LTC fell briefly back to $130 before marching back upwards to an all-time high of $165. The launch of the CBOE futures contracts, surging demand for Bitcoin, and overwhelmed crypto exchanges have highlighted some inherent problems with BTC. It has slow transaction speeds and can be costly to send or convert into other currencies. Litecoin is a better alternative in both of these factors, with the additional fact that it is far more stable than Bitcoin.Silver to Bitcoin\u2019s GoldLitecoin sits at number 6 in the crypto market cap charts where, at the time of writing, it has a cap of $8.86 billion. It is marginally behind 5th placed Ripple with its $9.52 billion market cap. The difference is that XRP has done very little over the past six months and has traded sideways, bouncing between $0.15 and $0.26. It has a huge total supply of just under 100 billion, and 38.7 billion are currently circulating. According to reports, Ripple has locked up 55 billion XRP in escrow to eliminate supply uncertainty.Just below Litecoin at number 7 is Dash with a market cap of $5.58 billion, a maximum quota of 18.9 million coins, and a current circulation of 7.74 million. Dash has done well in recent months, but in the last week, it has not been able to keep pace with Litecoin. It currently trades at $720, down from the week\u2019s high of $780.Comparing these two to Litecoin, which has a total supply of 84 million, 54.25 million circulating, and a trade price at the time of writing of $162, it looks like Litecoin is the clear winner. Charlie Lee\u2019s LTC is often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin\u2019s gold, and if current demand continues, that silver could easily reach $200 in the next week or so.Do you think Litecoin will continue to outshine other cryptocurrencies?

One veteran market forecaster, Peter Schiff, came out and said that Bitcoin has no value.Peter Schiff, the CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, downplayed the value of Bitcoin in an interview with TheStreet, claiming that there\u2019s no value in the digital currency. He further told TheStreet that one reason for his view on Bitcoin\u2019s worth was that, no matter how much the value of the cryptocurrency increases, investors aren\u2019t ready to let go off their bitcoins. He added:Ultimately, I think bitcoin has really no value. In the market, it has plenty of value. As long as there\u2019s buying, there\u2019s value. But when the buying goes away, so does the value.Peter Schiff also believes that whatever is happening now is that investors are dancing to the music of Bitcoin as they\u2019re drunk on the digital currency\u2019s Kool-Aid, but when the music stops, the risk will be clearly evident. He noted that the paper profits will eventually vanish, leaving investors in dismay.A Double Standard for Peter Schiff?Peter Schiff talks tough on the value of Bitcoin, claiming that it could be worthless in the long run, but it appears that his website \u2013 Shiffgold.com \u2013 has an option for Bitcoin payments. He even touts the top five benefits of owning Bitcoin, such as #5:No Third-Party Seizure \u2013 The Bitcoin system is built on redundancy. Because multiple copies of every transaction exist on the blockchain, nobody can get your bitcoins. There is currently no way for governments to seize or freeze your wealth.Schiff knows that the increasing attention of the digital currency by the mainstream and the fact that Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) is offering futures contracts for Bitcoin (to be followed by CME) will lead to more excitement, with many investors deciding to dip their toes into the crypto world.Others Have a Differing ViewpointThe views of other industry experts contradict that of Peter Schiff, with some claiming that the party for Bitcoin is not over yet. While some believe that the prices could finally hit the $20,000 mark in the next few years, others have the view that the digital currency is destined to hit even greater highs, especially with the increased acceptance.Overall, Bitcoin has had an interesting year. At the start of 2017, Bitcoin was worth just around$1,000, but the price has been increasing since then, hitting record highs over the months to reach a peak of $18,000 on December 8th before dropping back down to just over $15,000. Hopefully, Peter Schiff\u2019s forecast will turn out just to be nothing but hot air.Do you Bitcoin has no value? Do you believe it drop in value or gain a lot more in the coming year?

Muslim Religious Views Remain Conflicted But Might Be Easing Samuel Rae | Dec 11, 2017 | 17:15 Share Tweet Send Share The way that Bitcoin fits into various religions across the globe is very much a hot topic right now and, as might be expected, not everyone is on the same page. Global Bitcoin regulation and the approach various governments and policymakers are taking towards the regulation of, and legal framework that underpins, Bitcoin has dominated crypto-centric news media coverage (and, to a degree, more mainstream media coverage) over the past twelve months. With prices rising so dramatically across this period, this space has become something that said policymakers are no longer able to ignore and, be it accommodative or not, we\u2019ve seen a range of approaches signed into law.The Religious Side of the CoinThe compatibility, or lack thereof, of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with various global religions hasn\u2019t attracted nearly as much attention. More recently, however, it seems this is changing.Back in November, news emerged from Turkey that Bitcoin has been deemed \u201cnot compatible with Islam.\u201d The opinions voiced are those of the nation\u2019s Directorate of Religious Affairs, or Diyanet, which is an organization set up to help deal with the implications of religion on everyday life in Turkey.More recently, at the start of last week, Jeddah-based cleric Assim al-Hakeem reported by way of his YouTube channel and associated program, AskZaad, that Bitcoin is haram (forbidden or proscribed by Islamic law), based on the fact that it is \u201can open gate for money laundering, drug money, and haram money.\u201dSo why is this news now?Well, because these views are now being countered by none other than the peers of those expressing them.'Sharia standards do not cover this issue yet': 'Halal' #bitcoin may be coming to Muslim community near you https://t.co/JGyFhuOaJW pic.twitter.com/YI0MigA8w0\u2014 RT (@RT_com) November 5, 2017A Counter-viewAs outlined here, Muslim clerics are now declaring that owning bitcoin is compatible with Islam. There\u2019s also this paper, published back in 2015 by Charles Evans (it is a couple of years old but the concepts are very much up to date and applicable here), which outlines the compatibility of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with the rules and laws of Islamic finance. Indeed, that paper even goes so far as to suggest Bitcoin might actually be more compliant with Sharia Law than fiat:Bitcoin or a similar system might be a more appropriate medium of exchange in Islamic Banking and Finance than riba-backed central bank fiat currency, especially among the unbanked and in small-scale cross-border trade.Whatever happens in the near term, there\u2019s no doubt this is just the start of a long and multi-faceted discussion among global religious leaders and policymakers as to where Bitcoin fits into the current religious and economic frameworks that dominate modern society.What do you think?

As one analyst notes to Quartz, however, the token has since become an undesired speculatory asset, which Xunlei itself finds worrying.\u201cWhen it first came out, a coin was available for only 1 cent, but the over-the-counter price was now around $8 a piece,\u201d its CEO told local publication Beijing News about OneCoin\u2019s recent explosion.Not A Hint Of PonziA major bone of contention for Xunlei is the altcoin\u2019s legal status should it become too widespread, given China\u2019s current regulatory stranglehold on free trading of cryptoassets.A dispute with a partner did not help the situation, which resulted in allegations Xunlei was conducting a banned ICO in China. In response to regulatory fears, meanwhile, the company announced that every trader using its wallet must supply their real name and become verified by December 14, something which then sent prices back down again.While seemingly unimportant to Chinese traders, OneCoin also shares itself with a notorious international alleged ponzi scheme which multiple international governments have warned citizens not to invest in. That OneCoin has already seen its fair share of arrests, with Indian lawmakers notably freezing funds associated with the scheme.What do you think about China\u2019s OneCoin?

In fact, just two days before the launch of Bitcoin futures, three fund managers each requested regulatory approval for Bitcoin ETFs: First Trust Advisors LP, REX Shares LLC, and Van Eck Associates Corp.Fund Managers Eager to Obtain Approval for Bitcoin ETFsBecause ETFs seem to promise high profitability, for the past several months, fund managers have been trying to obtain the approval of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch Bitcoin ETFs.According to Reuters, Dave Nadig, CEO of ETF.com, declared:There\u2019s a real advantage, particularly in a niche ETF, to being the first one that gets to market, that gets the trading volume.To date, the SEC has rejected all Bitcoin ETF applications because there was no regulation in the Bitcoin market. Now things have changed. CBOE launched Bitcoin derivatives on December 10, 2017, providing a regulated framework. As Spencer Bogart, head of research for Blockchain Capital explained:If you look at what the SEC said in its ETF disapproval from earlier this year, it essentially needed to see the underlying bitcoin spot market become more regulated, or it needed to see a fully functional derivatives ecosystem that is regulated.On December 8, 2017, just before Bitcoin derivatives became a reality, First Trust Advisors LP, REX Shares LLC, and Van Eck Associates Corp, each submitted applications with the SEC to launch Bitcoin ETFs.Here's the latest snapshot of the Bitcoin ETF Race, now up to 15 filings! $BTC #CannonballRun pic.twitter.com/SzxqvnhpO8\u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 11, 2017SEC\u2019s Earlier Rejections of Bitcoin ETFsSo far, the SEC has not been welcoming to Bitcoin ETFs. For example, the world expected that the SEC would approve the listing and trading of Winklevoss Bitcoin Shares, issued by the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, on March 11, 2017.Hopes were high. At that time, Spencer Bogart, then an analyst at boutique investment bank Needham & Co., had predicted that $300 million could enter the Bitcoin ecosystem in the first week after the ETF was approved.In anticipation, the value of Bitcoin hovered near an all-time high piercing the $1,200 USD barrier. However, disappointingly, the SEC rejected the Winklevoss\u2019s ETF application.Reportedly, the Winklevoss twins have reapplied for SEC approval. According to CNBC:The third-largest ETF issuer, State Street, said it will be the fund administrator and provide accounting services for the Winklevoss ETF if and when it is approved by the SEC.If the SEC approves any Bitcoin ETFs, interest from institutional investors could propel Bitcoin\u2019s value to incredible highs. However, if the SEC decides to reject the ETF applications, Bitcoin is likely to plunge and pause. Then, within a short period, as usual, Bitcoin will most probably spring back, stronger, reinvigorated, and poised to ascend to new highs.What do you think about the potential impact of the SEC approval or disapproval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)?

Today we explore just how much energy Bitcoin mining really uses and 5 possible ways to reduce or offset its power consumption.In 2011, Google revealed that it used enough energy from fossil fuels to continuously power 200,000 homes, which is about one quarter the output of a nuclear power plant. At the time, one Google search was equivalent to turning on a 60W light bulb for 17 seconds.That\u2019s a lot of energy usage.Fast forward to today, Google just announced that they purchased enough clean energy in 2017 to offset their entire carbon footprint. They assigned a lot of smart people to work on the problem, invested billions in reducing their carbon footprint, and made huge energy efficiency gains.Enter Bitcoin and the criticism of its ever-increasing carbon footprint.If you believe the researchers, the annual amount of energy needed to mine Bitcoin is more than the entire annual electricity needs of Ireland. Moreover, according to Dutch bank ING, the energy required to trade a single Bitcoin can power a house for an entire month.This means that mining Bitcoin is contributing to global climate change.Just How Expensive is Bitcoin Mining?According to Digiconomist, Bitcoin uses about 32 terawatts of energy every year, enough to power about three million U.S. households. Worse, they claim, the energy required to mine Bitcoin is about to scale exponentially.Many people are under the mistaken belief that Bitcoin mining is based on a mathematical formula that gets steadily more difficult to solve as more and more Bitcoins are produced.That\u2019s inaccurate.The Bitcoin founders developed the network to automatically adjust the difficulty of mining to make certain that one block is generated every 10 minutes, regardless of the level of computing power there is on the network.In 2009, when Bitcoin launched, every block produced yielded 50 Bitcoin as payment for the miner who produced it. That amount decreases by half every four years. In 2012, it decreased to 25 bitcoins and in 2016 to 12.5 Bitcoins per block. The compensation will decrease again to 6.25 bitcoins in 2020.Logically then, when revenues are cut in half, the cost of producing it should decrease by the same proportion, else miners would find it unprofitable.Still, Eric Holthaus from Grist sees it a different way and writes that at current growth rates, the Bitcoin network will \u201cuse as much electricity as the entire world does today by early 2020. This is an unsustainable trajectory.\u201dIs This Really a Problem?First, I think it\u2019s fair to ask, do we need to fix the problem? Like any other form of physical stores of value (e.g. Gold, oil, fiat currency) it takes energy to produce them. Mining for gold and drilling for oil have massive impacts on the environment.But Bitcoin is digital so why design it to consume more energy than required?Satoshi Nakamoto anticipated the increasing energy question and designed Bitcoin to roughly equalize the cost of mining a block with the current value of the block.He built in a form of scarcity and enforced through the Proof of Work algorithm. Scarcity and an identity-less, fair distribution mechanism are why Bitcoin is skyrocketing in value.Some people are okay with this original arrangement despite the costs to the environment. They argue that the cost of a secure and transparent money system is worth the impact to the environment.I\u2019m not totally bought into that argument as Bitcoin could \u2013 in theory \u2013 still fail and therefore the whole exercise \u2013 futile.So What are the Solutions to the Environmental Issue?The solution may not yet be invented but there are at least five viable options I\u2019ve uncovered that I believe are worth exploring.First, as Google did, the Bitcoin mining community can purchase clean energy offsets to lessen the impact on the environment. But this is highly unlikely because unlike Google, the miners aren\u2019t all working under a single executive team.Miners can begin to transition to an eco-friendlier power source like Vienna-based HydroMiner, who uses renewable hydroelectric power to mine Bitcoin. I believe we will see more miners heading this direction, but it will only be a small percentage of them until the cost of renewable energy sources are less and there are easy access points. Currently, both are an issue in less renewable energy developed countries like China and Russia.This is really a 2a, but the community could further incentivize miners with additional Bitcoin by rewarding them for using renewable sources. This could be programmed into the algorithm or offered as a bonus for proof of renewables. Admittedly, there are difficulties in updating the miner payout process, but if there is a goodwill, there is always a crypto way.A fourth option would be to switch to a Proof of Stake (PoS) mining process with a twist. Whereas PoS seeks to validate block transactions according to the coins she or he holds, one can add an additional requirement to give more mining weight to those using renewable energy sources. Like #3 above, switching to an alternative mining algorithm would be strongly opposed by miners that have invested huge sums of money in their current systems.The fifth and my own option is to offer a 1000 Bitcoin reward (roughly $17,000,000 USD) for the first individual or group that presents a zero-carbon solution to the problem with the least disruption. A committee of environmental scientists and crypto experts would weigh each of the submissions and nominate 5 solutions for Bitcoin holders to vote on. The community would vote with a small amount of Bitcoin to help fund the reward and to ensure fairness. Then, with community consensus, the Bitcoin developers would implement the changes. The key here is funding the reward. If the reward can\u2019t be raised by the voting mechanism, then that may be a fatal flaw in this option.Summing it All UpUltimately, there\u2019s an argument to be made that we should just allow the current mining process to play out. As the cost of mining becomes too expensive, there is a built-in mechanism to reduce the amount of energy expended to validate a block.Moreover, truly free markets enable Capitalists to innovate. If there\u2019s big money involved, there will be efficient solutions created to squeeze out a profit. Since energy costs are the largest mining expenditure, the most innovative solutions will be created to both reduce energy usage and costs.I suspect open market competition over scarce resources is going to help mitigate the environmental impact and transparently assigning an energy value to back the system is going to provide a scorecard. We need to balance the environmental impact with the cryptocurrencies that solve real problems with real value associated with them.I\u2019m betting that final balanced scorecard is in favor of continued mining.What do you think of the solutions presented here? Can you think of any other possible solutions to solve the Bitcoin mining energy problem?

This latest move could end up helping them do just that.France has traditionally taken a very hard stance when it comes to the trade and advertisement of leveraged financial instruments such as CFDs and Forex pairs. It still wants to be a leading blockchain financial center, however, a decidedly untraditional move. In a statement to the press, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire commented on the decision to allow trade in :The use of this new technology will allow fintech firms and other financial actors to develop new ways of trading securities that are faster, cheaper, more transparent and safer.He also added that the proposed rules would be \u201canother asset for Paris\u2019 attractiveness as a financial center.\u201dIf it becomes law, the new rules will make it possible for fintech companies and banks to set up platforms based on blockchain where unlisted securities can be traded. This will cut out the middlemen such as custodian banks and brokers.However, these rules are not expected to have any impact on listed securities. They will still continue to trade on financial exchanges as normal. The listed securities will need to go through clearinghouses and custodians as they have done in the past.Brexit and the New Financial Arms RaceOne reason why France is making such a bold move is Brexit. In the wake of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, much uncertainty has surrounded UK-based financial institutions serving continental Europe. This has created an arms race for secondary financial centers throughout Europe. Places such as Paris, Dublin, Milan, and Frankfurt are jockeying to make themselves attractive to financial giants operating on the continent.Despite their current efforts, however, most of these places are still a long way from becoming leading financial centers that can supplant London. Regardless, they will no doubt manage to attract some increased financial activity because of the fallout from Brexit. The decision by France to use blockchain for unlisted securities is a move in this direction. They are clearly aiming to make the most out of this situation and are doing what it takes to get the edge over their competitors.Will this latest move by France make the country more attractive to the financial world? Do you think allowing blockchain technology in its financial system is the right move? Let us know in the comments below.Images courtesy of EPA, AdobeStock"}

Some governments feel that crypto will pave the way for an increase in money laundering and other fraudulent activities financed by digital currency.Where Is the Love, China?One such country is China, who seem to have a love-hate relationship (currently set to hate) with Bitcoin. During their honeymoon phase, Chinese authorities were hesitant but accepted Bitcoin in all its decentralized glory. Investors in the country were looking forward to putting their money into something that wasn\u2019t controlled by the iron fist of the country\u2019s heavily regulated financial industry.Excerpts from the MIT Technology Review state that, in 2013, more Bitcoin wallets were downloaded by computers located in China than in all of the countries in the rest of the world combined. That year also saw $35 million in Bitcoin being moved around the Chinese exchange on a daily basis. As of September this year, more than two thirds of bitcoins were mined in China.In fact, there was a time that China encouraged mining, especially in areas where there was a surplus of hydroelectric power. Even though China seems to be calling a timeout on their Bitcoin relationship, the mining sector didn\u2019t get the memo, resulting in concern that the country will have too much power over this and blockchain technology.Bitcoin did, however, offer a way for its holders to sidestep the country\u2019s strict capital controls. China\u2019s concern at how much of their currency was leaving the country resulted in them setting a limit of $50,000 worth of yuan outflow per person per year. With Bitcoin, holders could buy the crypto in yuan, sell it on a US exchange and then withdraw the dollars. China attempted to stop this by prohibiting financial institutions from transacting with Bitcoin exchanges.However, Bitcoin fever had taken root, and holders found a loophole around this. They used vouchers to buy the currency on exchanges and even sent money to the personal bank accounts of exchange employees. These exchanges would also get their turn on the chopping block, but we\u2019ll get to that.Bitcoin\u2019s popularity continued to grow throughout the world, and especially in China. In fact, last year saw most of the world\u2019s Bitcoin trades being in yuan. Then 2017 happened. From the beginning of this year, the currency has grown by over 1000%, really turning up the heat for regulation-happy countries.2017: China\u2019s Year of RegulationSeptember this year saw China step up their regulation, or perhaps clampdown, game by banning ICOs in the country. This move may have caused anger in the hearts of crypto enthusiasts, yet the country\u2019s own crypto community took it in stride.China did seem to have a good reason though. Technology Review reports that the consensus was that nearly 90% of ICOs in China were run by fraudsters. Because Bitcoin interest was running high, everyone wanted to get in on the action, including inexperienced investors. Easy pickings for ICO scammers.Da Hongfei, founder of NEO, which is also known as the \u2018Chinese Ethereum,\u2019 understood the ban. This understanding came after driving on Germany\u2019s famous Autobahn, a highway system in Germany that has no speed limit. He says driving here is possible as:They have good-quality roads, they have a very strict test for a driver\u2019s license. Everybody is obeying the traffic rules, and they have very good-quality cars.He added:If we don\u2019t do a speed limit in China, or even maybe the United States, that would be a disaster.This would be a great comparison, if China\u2019s actions didn\u2019t essentially close the ICO highway. Perhaps it could be a temporary ban as the country works on regulating the process. This is a sentiment shared by industry experts.Lu Bin, CEO of Shanghai-based startup, Andui, held his ICO in August this year and raised more than $20 million. However, all of that money had to be returned once the ban was in effect. Surprisingly, Bin took the same stance as the authorities and felt that the ban was more of a protective measure against fraud. He is now raising capital through private investment and is optimistic about the future of crypto in China. He said:We are believers. We believe the Chinese market is eventually going to open.He added that if cryptocurrency reaches its goal of mainstream adoption, China would not want to miss that particular train.The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be applying their own regulations by possibly enforcing start-ups to register with the SEC before conducting their ICOs.Exchanges: You\u2019re NextNext in the line of regulatory fire by Chinese authorities were exchanges. Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, which is China\u2019s longest running exchange, knew that the end was nigh, especially after authorities explicitly stated that exchanges needed to close. As with most people in China\u2019s crypto community, Lee took it quite calmly. He thought:Ah, finally, the party\u2019s over. The party has to end sometime.However, the allure of Bitcoin is one that cannot be denied. Crypto enthusiasts found a loophole around this ban as well. Currency holders have turned to decentralized peer-to-peer trading marketplaces. One such platform, LocalBitcoins, has seen a massive surge in yuan transactions, with the last week of November seeing nearly \u00a5140,000 traded.Holders have also started trading on the Telegram messaging app. Even though said app is blocked in the country, it can be accessed through VPNs. Overseas-based exchanges are also an option, as is using the WeChat messaging app, even though the latter is monitored by authorities.Blockchain Without the BitcoinChina is, however, well aware of the benefits of blockchain, the technology supporting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Ben Koo, an engineering professor at Tsinghua University, had this to say:The central government wants to use blockchain to ensure the trustworthiness of public and administrative data, but they don\u2019t want people to print their own money.China may have hopes of launching their own virtual currency in a bid to replace Bitcoin. However, according to Bobby Lee, it would be a completely different animal than Bitcoin. He went on to add:It\u2019s going to be a controlled, centralized currency that happens to be digital; it happens to have some encryption technologies in it.According to Lee, if it will be controlled by the same regulations as the country\u2019s fiat currency, then it won\u2019t be truly free, unlike Bitcoin.China\u2019s Attempts Have Not Ended BitcoinAfter the country\u2019s ICO ban, the price of Bitcoin did drop. However, it has more than recovered in the interim. It reached the $20,000 mark on some exchanges. It seems to have a knack for getting back up, with a vengeance, after it\u2019s been knocked down.In a way, the fact that China deemed Bitcoin worthy of any type of regulation may have worked in the currency\u2019s favor. Yan Chen, CEO of NBL, a service for storing cryptocurrency wallets, had this to say:When China started regulating Bitcoin, it sent a message that China takes this currency very seriously. The market sees that Bitcoin is something that governments are afraid of, so it must be really powerful.It does seem as if all of China\u2019s efforts to control the currency has been in vain, probably due to the fact that by its very nature, it cannot be controlled. Bobby Lee added:Bitcoin itself did not break after China banned it. Every time you try to whack Bitcoin and it doesn\u2019t die, it becomes stronger.Perhaps the next step for China should be to follow the example of Japan and support Bitcoin as a legal tender. Or, they can continue to believe that the currency is dying while the rest of the world hops on that very lucrative Bitcoin bandwagon.Do you think that China will continue its crypto crackdown?

BTC hasn\u2019t fluctuated much from around $16,400 where it currently trades. Huge swings in the king of crypto were bounteous this weekend amid the launch of CBOE\u2019s futures contracts. Bitcoin gained and lost over $5,000 in just a few days before recovering but Ethereum has remained pretty flat for weeks \u2026 until now.The Asian trading session this morning has been lively, to say the least, especially for Litecoin and Ethereum, both reaching record highs. For the past three weeks, Ethereum been stuck in second gear, sitting in a sideways channel trading around $460 with only marginal gains. At around 23.00 UTC things started to reverberate for the crypto asset as it broke through resistance levels and headed upwards up and over the psychological $500 level.According to CoinMarketCap, the skyward surge continued and ETH reached an all-time high of $553 four hours later. This represents a jump of around 17% in just a few hours. A slight correction pulled prices back down to around $530 but it has since regained momentum.Market Cap SurgeEthereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap. This alone jumped from $46 billion yesterday to around $51 billion today. CoinMarketCap\u2019s data indicated that Coinbase owned GDAX was responsible for the most transactions, $287 million \u2013 around 11% of the total \u2013 in the past 24 hours. The second most popular exchange for Ethereum was Bitfinex with 9.5% of the trade, followed by South Korea\u2019s Bithumb running 7.5% of the transactions.The total amount of Ethereum shifted over the past 24 hours was $2.6 billion at the time of writing. The last time ETH broke $500 was very briefly during the CryptoKitties craze that swept the internet at the end of November. The network became bogged down by digital cats and transactions ground to a halt. Prices dropped back to around $450 where they have remained up until yesterday.Big Banks Back BlockchainThe latest surge has likely come off the back of news that the global banking industry is showing an interest in Ethereum based smart contracts. News reports revealed that Barclays, Credit Suisse, KBC, SIX, Thomson Reuters, and UBS are seeking to automate Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II requirements with the assistance from smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By doing so enables large financial institutions to meet more stringent regulations and directives on a common platform.At the time of writing Ethereum was trading at around $535, 16% higher than the same time last month.Where is the top for Ethereum, can it go even higher this year?

They will be working to coordinate on cross-platform ICO disclosure protocols.CEO and founder of Waves Platform, Alexander Ivanov, stated:Regulation is clearly an emerging phenomenon and concern in the crypto space. If certain jurisdictions have not yet announced their intentions, then it\u2019s only a matter of time. Waves has always been clear that regulation \u2013 the right kind of regulation \u2013 is a good thing for the crypto space. We have also been clear that we want to be a part of that emerging dialogue. We want a seat at the table to be able to shape the future of regulation in the ICO and blockchain space.Ethereum On BoardEthereum\u2019s Advisory Board member, Vladislav Martynov, had this to say on the initiative:Joint and voluntary initiatives such as this self-regulatory body for token sales are a critical element in the professionalization of the blockchain industry. As custodians of some of the most remarkable and disruptive technology ever created, we must be seen to be fostering its responsible use as well as building functionality and maintaining the security of the ecosystem.There will be a number of major functions that the association will be dealing with, and these include the creation of reporting guidelines for ICO projects, KYC/AML guidelines for ICO investors, business due diligence, and legal assessment.Waves will be registering the Swiss-based association over the next couple of months while creating its executive bodies and issuing proposed industry standards.

He added that the value of Bitcoin will also drop.In an interview with the Financial Times, Belfort said:Promoters are perpetuating a massive scam of the highest order on everyone.He went on to add:Probably 85% of people out there don\u2019t have bad intentions but the problem is if 5% or 10% are trying to scam you.Bitcoin doesn\u2019t seem to be aware that its price will soon be plummeting as Friday saw it sail past the $18k mark. According to Coinmarketcap, at the time of writing, it was trading at nearly $18,800, with $19k within touching distance. 2017: the Year of the BitcoinThese record-breaking numbers come on the tail end of the currency\u2019s most spectacular year yet. It was trading at just $1k in January and has grown by over 1,700% in 2017.Since reaching five-figure status in November, Bitcoin has continued its upward trend. However, this month showed astronomical increases, with the digital currency growing by nearly 80%.Seeming to work in tandem with this growth is the amount of criticism it receives, which ironically seem to make its price increase even more. In addition, the Bitcoin market seems to be reigning in its proclivity for volatility possibly due to the recent launch of CBOE\u2019s futures trading.Tulip FeverNo amount of positive press, forays into mainstream adoption, or price increases appear to deter naysayers. In fact, the more success Bitcoin has, the more it raises the ire of its critics.Belfort recently told CNN:I think it\u2019s a huge danger right now that people are looking at this as the next great thing, it\u2019s a bubble for sure.Like many other industry experts, Belfort has compared Bitcoin to Holland\u2019s infamous \u2018tulip mania\u2019, meaning that Bitcoin\u2019s fantastic price surges are in fact a precursor to its inevitable crash:The next stage, you will see it really skyrocket, there will be a short squeeze, it will go even higher and then eventually it will come caving in, it\u2019s almost a guarantee.He added:If you were the most disciplined person and get in and get out, there is probably a short window to make some money. But that\u2019s not human nature, people will get in and make some money and they want to make more money. In the tulip bubble, the beginning of the end was when they started trading futures on tulips, that was another move up and then all of a sudden it collapses and it\u2019s over.#bitcoin just keeps growing pic.twitter.com/uV0ilLQdDl\u2014 VERTGAWD (@cryptocointee) November 4, 2017It Just Keeps GrowingAdding his two virtual cents to the conversation is Andrew Bailey, head of the British government\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority.

The meteoric rise of Bitcoin over the course of 2017 has pushed such regulatory concerns to the forefront. Now the European Union (EU) has agreed to a cryptocurrency clampdown that will impact exchanges and wallets in order to combat terrorism, tax evasion, and money laundering.Reasons for the ClampdownThe European Council and European Parliament agreed on a number of measures for their cryptocurrency clampdown. Apparently, the negotiations for these new regulations have been underway for a year and were brought about due to the terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015 and in Brussels in 2016.The opinion is that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were being used to finance terrorism, and the fact that virtual currencies offer a great deal of anonymity help such illicit funding.Vera Jourova, Europe\u2019s Justice Commissioner, celebrated the new regulations, saying:Today\u2019s agreement will bring more transparency to improve the prevention of money laundering and to cut off terrorist financing.Transparency International, a group dedicated to fighting corruption, also hailed the new regulations. They called the new rules a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d and added:However, several loopholes remain, such as the lack of public access to information on the beneficiaries of trusts and similar arrangements. These loopholes should be addressed as EU Member States start to implement these revisions.Another reason for the new clampdown rules is to combat tax evasion. The publication of the Panama and Paradise Papers have shown that many celebrities, politicians, and businessmen have secretly funneled money to tax havens.Devil is in the DetailsSo what are the details of this cryptocurrency clampdown? First, cryptocurrency exchanges will have to identify their users, and the same goes for any wallet providers as well.Limits will be placed upon the use of pre-paid payment cards, which is due to the fact that authorities believe that they could have been used to fund militant attacks. Transparency requirements for trust owners and companies will be raised. National investigators will be allowed more access to information, and this access includes national bank account registers. The final bit of the new regulations is that access is granted to data on the beneficiaries of trusts to \u201cpersons who can demonstrate a legitimate interest.\u201dOverall, these new cryptocurrency regulations are a massive blow to individual freedom, granting authorities increased access to private data. It seems that being anonymous will no longer be tolerated.The new cryptocurrency rules will need to be adopted by the various EU members within 18 months and enshrined into law. However, some countries are against the new regulations, including Malta, Luxembourg, Ireland, Cyprus, and Britain.Personally, I think that there\u2019s a lot that the EU can do to combat terrorism and tax evasion without having to rip away some of the privacy features of cryptocurrency. But it seems that the only \u201ctransparency\u201d that the EU bureaucrats really want in place is the privacy of cryptocurrency holders.What do you think about this cryptocurrency clampdown by the EU? Will it actually help stop terrorism or is this just a smokescreen?

One can order clothes, food, and entertainment online with extreme ease. Of course, this also means that it\u2019s becoming that much easier to purchase unsavory things online, such as illicit narcotics, stolen passwords, and even a murder or two. Which is what happened when an Italian woman living in Denmark hired a hitman with bitcoins via the Dark Web (insert ominous music here) to kill her boyfriend. Now the woman is being jailed for six years due to her Bitcoin murder plot.Bitcoins for BloodThe Italian woman, who has remained unnamed, hired the hitman on a site called Crime Bay. She wanted the hitman to murder her boyfriend, so she sent the hitman a photograph of the intended victim along with his address. She insisted that the hitman use a silencer and that he succeed in killing the victim on the first attempt.The angle that has the media salivating is that the woman paid for this contract with 4.1 bitcoins, which was worth around $4,000 at the time of the contract. Now that amount is worth over $73,000. I wonder if the woman is angrier about being sent to prison for six years or that the bitcoins she paid with are now worth so much more.Do the Crime, Pay the TimeApparently, hiring a hitman on the Dark Web (cue even more ominous music) with Bitcoin is an unusual circumstance in Denmark. The 58-year-old woman pled not guilty to the charges, but she was just convicted. She\u2019ll spend the next six years in a Danish prison. After her sentence is completed, she\u2019ll be deported from Denmark, where she\u2019s lived for the last 30 years. The intended victim was in the court room when the sentence was handed down, and he spoke to the woman after the verdict. There\u2019s no details on what was said, but my fervent hope is that the man has Bitcoin of his own and that he told her how rich he is after selling it for almost $18,000 a pop.This story has everything that a media outlet could desire. You have murder, a contract killer, the Dark Web, and the use of Bitcoin to do the deed. Obvious this incident is proof that cryptocurrency goes hand-in-hand with illegal and terrible things. Yes, I\u2019m being sarcastic on that last point. The reality is that cryptocurrency can be used for good things or bad things, just like any other type of currency.Do you think that the six years is a reasonable punishment for an attempted murder?

Alarmists worry that the environment is doomed as coal is one of the primary power sources behind Bitcoin.I\u2019m Just a Coal Miner\u2019s CryptocurrencyThe angst concerning coal being a major component of Bitcoin\u2019s rise is a real one. The majority of Bitcoin mining takes place in China. In fact, China dominates mining with 58% of the global action, and the United States comes in at second place with a mere 16%. Overall, the rest of the world accounts for the remaining 26%.It takes a lot of power to mine and transact bitcoins. The Digiconomist estimates that the annual energy consumption by Bitcoin is 34.34 TWh, which is enough to power over 3 million American homes. The site also estimates that the average Bitcoin transaction consumes 240 KWh, which is enough to power 8 US households for a single day.The sticking point is that China is a heavy user of coal. The country gets roughly 60% of its electricity from coal, and China is responsible for a full quarter of all the global power used to create cryptocurrencies. An example of coal powering Bitcoin is that eight warehouses in Erdors, Inner Mongolia, each of which stretch 100 meters long, contain 25,000 computers used for mining. The entire warehouse operation is based upon coal-fueled electricity.Are We Doomed?The energy consumption by Bitcoin has led to some alarmist rhetoric. It\u2019s pointed out that those mining Bitcoin consume more electricity than 19 European countries. Predictions are made that doom is descending upon us all due to an endlessly rapacious power hunger from cryptocurrency. One alarmist, Eric Holthaus, wrote the following for Grist Magazine:By July 2019, the bitcoin network will require more electricity than the entire United States currently uses. By February 2020, it will use as much electricity as the entire world does today.Yet, cooler heads (pun intended) are saying that there\u2019s no cause to freak out over coal and the general power consumption by Bitcoin. They note that even the most high-end power estimates for the future actually account for only about 0.1% of what the world uses. Then there\u2019s the argument that more power plants (using a variety of power sources, such as nuclear, hydroelectric, etc.) will be built, thus increasing the global power supply.Another factor to consider is that improvements will be made to existing technology, such as that found in power plants, to make things more efficient. Yes, there are also coal plants that are a great deal cleaner than those of previous generations, but the reality is that most Chinese coal-based power plants are not of the most modern, and clean, variety.Bitcoinist looked at a number of ways to reduce the power consumption by Bitcoin, such as switching to a modified Proof of Stake mining process and incentivizing miners to use renewable sources. Then there\u2019s the possibility that the costs for Bitcoin mining will eventually be too expensive in terms of energy consumption to generate a profit. This is a self-regulating mechanism that could kick into effect if such a situation occurs. No profit, then no mining. It\u2019s that simple.So, should we be concerned that coal is being used to power Bitcoin mining in China? I\u2019m of two minds on this. One, I would prefer power plants to be as environmentally-friendly as possible. The issue is that China does not have the best track record for environmental stewardship, which is a concern.However, I fully understand that the world needs power to run. Things like air conditioning, the internet, computers, vehicles, and functioning hospitals all require energy to run. Every time you use Google to look something up or stream a movie on Netflix, you\u2019re consuming energy. I believe that man\u2019s ingenuity and market forces will work to ensure that there\u2019s plenty of energy for everybody. The only areas that face energy shortages are those that don\u2019t allow for market forces (and individual liberties) to exist, such as Venezuela. I believe that, in the end, everything will be okay and that the sky won\u2019t fall.What do you think about coal being an important power source for Bitcoin mining? What alternatives would you suggest instead of coal?

This may seem insignificant, as it only one exchange, and on top of that, we\u2019ve seen Bitcoin prices skyrocket over the market price in illiquid regions, such as Nigeria. Nigeria specifically saw $22,00 prices on local exchanges when the price of Bitcoin for the rest of the world was around $16,000.CEX.io hitting $20k is a huge deal, however, as it is the first BTC/USD trading pair to break the ceiling and sustain a $20k+ trade price.

Coinbase and its exchange, GDAX, has been rattled to its core as the team tries to deal with the $1+ billion in transaction volume it is currently experiencing. Bitstamp\u2019s CEO, Nejc Kodric, had this to say about the recent influx of users on their site:Please understand that we currently have over 100,000 new accounts opened daily.

Recent announcements of future protocol upgrades to Bitcoin, such as a functioning lightning network coming soon next year and Schnorr signatures are nothing but bullish for Bitcoin. Along with that, many traditional investment banks are beginning to offer Bitcoin Futures trading for the public. 2018 will be an exciting year.Where do you think the price of Bitcoin will go from here?

By comparison, another recent investor, Weiyi Capital, owns a 1.5996% stake.Founded in 2004, Giant Network, formerly Shanghai ZT Network Co., Ltd., is an online gaming company that has developed many popular games, including Journey, AI Light, Vainglory, Arcade: Three Kingdoms, and others. The company is listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and has a market cap of more than 75.5 billion yuan ($11.4 billion). As of this writing, the company\u2019s share price is around 37.3 yuan ($5.64).Xu Mingxing, founder and CEO of OKCoin, confirmed Yuzhu\u2019s investment as well as that of fellow celebrity billionaire investor Lei Jun. Interestingly, Jun had previously denied any investment in the company. Research indicates that Beijing Oukai Lianchuang\u2019s business license was updated around the 31st of October this year to reflect the new data, it is not known exactly when the investment took place or whether it was before or after China\u2019s September ban on ICOs.In 2014 OKCoin raised $10 million in Series A funding from investment institutions and venture capitalists. Among the investors were Ceyuan Venture Capital, Mandra Capital, Ventures Lab, and prominent angel investor Cai Wensheng.Bouncing Back from China\u2019s BanChina sent shockwaves \u2013 and more than a little panic \u2013 through the cryptocurrency community in September when they instituted a complete ban on ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) as well as the trading of ICO tokens and cryptocurrencies on local exchanges.The ban, which also prohibited the trading of ICO tokens and cryptocurrencies on local exchanges, forced many exchange operators to either close up shop or move to more crypto-friendly locales like Hong Kong and Singapore. OKCoin took the latter route, moving its headquarters to Hong Kong. Their website also lists satellite offices in Canada, Ireland, Singapore, and Russia.In the months following the ban, several local exchanges, rather than closing or relocating, have changed their business model to circumvent Chinese regulations. They have transitioned to a peer-to-peer trading platform, a business model first introduced by LocalBitcoins.Not surprisingly, peer-to-peer transactions in the country have exploded since the ban, experiencing a growth rate of over 2000% according to Bloomberg.How will mainstream businesses investing in exchanges and other crypto businesses impact the cryptocurrency community?

The demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has drastically risen in the last couple of months, as more and more experts believe that the sector is going to rapidly grow in the next years. But as the transaction volume of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are steadily rising, the transaction times and fees are also rising.According to the website Bitcoinfees.info, the current average Bitcoin transaction fee costs around $19,99. The high fee costs may not be ideal for users that want to purchase simple and daily items like a cup of coffee or a pizza. Users have resorted to using different cryptocurrencies in order to save costs and time.The Solution by Signal founderMany new cryptocurrencies have emerged that are trying to tackle the current problems that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have. The founder of the famous end-to-end messaging app Signal, Moxie Marlinspike, is working on a new digital currency that is planning to offer simple, fast and cheap transactions for all users. The digital currency is called MobileCoin, is based on the open-source Stellar Consensus Protocols platform, the same platform that powers the Stellar protocol. In a recent news article by Wired, Marlinspike stated following regarding the new cryptocurrency:I think usability is the biggest challenge with cryptocurrency today,he further stated:The innovations I want to see are ones that make cryptocurrency deployable in normal environments, without sacrificing the properties that distinguish cryptocurrency from existing payment mechanisms.MobileCoin isn\u2019t only focusing on providing a cheap and fast alternative to Bitcoin. The new currency is also aiming to provide a more anonymous and private alternative to other cryptocurrencies.

The US-based exchange even suspended trading when things really got lively during Litecoin\u2019s romp to the top a few days ago. However new things could be coming to Coinbase in 2018.In an interview with CNBC, Coinbase CEO and co-founder, Brian Armstrong, discussed how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are becoming the next generation stock market. He first went into brief details on a new service which will allow traditional investors and institutions to buy and store cryptocurrencies securely:Coinbase Custody is seeking to become the first qualified custodian for institutions that are looking to store digital currency.Altcoin AdditionsThe interesting part came next when he started talking about altcoins. As the crypto market becomes \u201cStock Market 2.0\u201d he said that Coinbase plans to expand its altcoin listings in 2018.The ones that are the most exciting to us that we have on the platform today are bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin, but there\u2019s many more that are going to be added to the platform in 2018 and I think this is going to be a really exciting space for all kinds of institutional investors to make money.When questioned about SEC regulations, he said that they have stayed out of adding any ICOs on the platform to date because of that regulatory uncertainty. There is a cautious approach to the area and a number of factors are considered before they add a new asset to the platform. These include regulatory risk, diligence on the team, security audits on the coin, and the customer demand. Finally, Armstrong added that Coinbase is looking to provide a safe place where customers can have assets that they trust and participate in this market.Pick Your PoisonSpeculation is all that we currently have on what particular altcoins will be added to Coinbase.

Despite all the impending doom talk from the usual talking heads in the financial media, cryptocurrency continues to gain speed as it cheerily chugs along. Now the doubters and naysayers have another reason to gnash their teeth in frustration as the cryptocurrency market cap has reached $600 billion USD.Attaining New HeightsThe cryptocurrency market cap breached $600 billion early this morning and will likely dip back and forth across that line throughout the day. Leading the charge is Bitcoin, which has a robust market cap of over $329 billion. Coming in second is Ethereum, with a total of almost $70 billion market cap. Rounding out the top five are: Bitcoin Cash ($31.6 billion), the surging Ripple ($29 billion), and the popular Litecoin ($17.5 billion).To say that this is a big achievement is a huge understatement. One wonders if Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned the profound impact cryptocurrency would have upon the world when he revealed Bitcoin back in 2009. We\u2019ve come a long way since then, and 2017 has been absolutely gangbusters. Remember that it was just five days ago that the market cap for virtual currencies reached $500 billion (half a trillion dollars!).Surpassing Industry GiantsThe cryptocurrency march to dominance has left quite a few corporate and financial entities in the dust. It\u2019s amazing to see how quickly crypto is surpassing the market cap of long-established companies, and I have to admit that it was sheer joy to see cryptocurrency surpass JPMorgan Chase in value (take that, Jamie Dimon!).Right now, three major companies have more market cap that cryptocurrency: Apple ($873 billion), Alphabet (Google \u2013 almost $716 billion), and Microsoft ($640 billion). Here is a quick sampler of some of the companies that are now lower than the market cap of the combined cryptocurrencies:Amazon ($531 billion) Facebook ($523 billion) JPMorgan Chase ($355.6 billion) Exxon Mobil ($352 billion) Bank of America ($288 billion) Wal-Mart ($261 billion) Intel ($214 billion) Coca-Cola ($196 billion) Toyota ($184 billion) General Electric ($174 billion) Pepsico ($157 billion) Walt Disney ($151 billion) McDonalds ($135 billion)2017 may go down as the Year of the Bitcoin, but a lot of other virtual currencies are helping lead the crypto revolution. We\u2019ve seen the launch of Bitcoin futures trading, and many of the giant financial groups that once warned about cryptocurrency are now scurrying to get their piece of the action. Just imagine what could happen over the remaining two weeks of the year!

Japanese retail investors are believed to account for as much as 30 to 50% of all cryptocurrency trading. Japan\u2019s share of the market can be attributed perhaps mainly due to recent crackdowns on cryptocurrency trading in South Korea and China, leaving Japan the lion\u2019s share of, if not just Asian Bitcoin business, then the world\u2019s. Japanese government approval certainly helps too, with the country\u2019s Financial Services Agency announcing earlier this year that they would allow payment for goods and services in Bitcoin as well as granting licenses to a number of cryptocurrency exchanges. The word \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d itself has been voted as one of the 7 most influential buzzwords in the country as well.The Japanese Cryptocurrency FrenzyIn a recent article in The Hindu, former stock-trader-turned-bitcoin-trader Yoshinori Kobayashi stated:When I first heard about the bitcoin a few years ago, I thought it was a fraud, But I tried it out after I had come to know some people making money on it. I bought it at 60,000 yen, which quickly become 80,000 yen and I started to regret I hadn\u2019t started earlier.It\u2019s a similar story to that which we hear and read in the west, with many either convinced investing could be too late or at least that they bought a lot more earlier. Data compiled by the Japanese language website JPBitcoin shows Bitcoin trades conducted in yen reached their height of 4.51 million bitcoins in November, a figure which accounts for nearly half of the total of the world\u2019s major exchanges numbering 9.29 million bitcoin.Not Just Retail InvestorsHowever, some industry officials argue that not all yen-based Bitcoin trading is done by Japanese retail players \u2013 as some hedge funds trade too in bitcoin/yen to take advantage of price differentials between the yen and dollar price. When addressing critics\u2019 claims that the cryptocurrency market is too large or perhaps a bubble, Kobayashi optimistically and perhaps rationally explains:The world\u2019s total financial assets is around 10 quadrillion yen, and Bitcoin is only just about 0.1% of that, which seems way too small if we assume the use of bitcoin spreads.Confidence in cryptocurrency in Japan seems to also be at an all-time high, and perhaps it\u2019s forward-thinking adoption and tolerance could serve as a timely reminder for the rest of Asia and the West to come to terms with methods of conducting non-harmful regulation and to perhaps do it in a more timely fashion.Is Japan leading the way in cryptocurrency regulation and is it the government\u2019s recognition that has given investors the confidence to invest?

The couple cite that their initial investment move was driven by curiosity and a desire to diversify their portfolio as prices for Bitcoin in 2013 reached a height of $1163 from a low of $14 in January of the same year.Tecco added:We pretty much forgot about it for a few years (the bitcoin investment) and then this year, it got interesting.Charity In The CryptosphereCharitable giving from the cryptocurrency community has been an ongoing effort, although investors should show caution to whom they choose to donate.

Mark Fidelman | Dec 17, 2017 | 14:45 Share Tweet Send Share The SEC just issued another warning over Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) but the test of a utility versus a security token is still murky. Here\u2019s what I believe the 5 Actions the SEC will take against ICOs in the next 6 months.SEC Chairman Jay Clayton says, \u201cI have yet to see an ICO that doesn\u2019t have a sufficient number of hallmarks of a security.\u201d Of course! But are you applying this standard fairly Mr. Clayton?Beanie Babies, baseball cards, and virtual goods in video games all have the same hallmarks of a security, but where are the regulations?The expectation of future profit? Check. Asset sellers promoting their future value? Check. A current product or service in a common enterprise? Check. Profits derived from the efforts of a third party? Maybe not.And therein lies the rub.I wanted to condemn the SEC for hypocrisy, but unlike other government bodies, found them exercising patience and reason.Referring to an SEC investigation report published this month Clayton discussed how to distinguish whether a token is a security:Specifically, we concluded that the token offering represented an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.By the way, that\u2019s not new. The Supreme court stated nearly the same thing 71 years ago.But does a 71-year-old opinion still apply to today\u2019s world?Golf Club Memberships and Crypto KittiesIf you haven\u2019t been following the CryptoKitties craze you\u2019re missing an important Pokemon moment in the crypto community. Like Pokemon did for augmented reality last year, CryptoKitties have broken through an important threshold for cryptocurrencies. CryptoKitties is a game for breeding, collecting and selling digital cats for real currency. Think Beanie Babies that breed.Players of CryptoKitties have spent over $10 million on these digital felines and some sell for as much as $100,000. They meet all the \u201challmarks of a security\u201d so why hasn\u2019t the SEC neutered them yet? Ostensibly the digital kitty owner takes \u201cpossession\u201d of it, but not really. Axiom Zen, the site owner also has \u201cpossession\u201d by setting the rules and control of the marketplace. So if Axiom is still providing a service to increase the value of the CryptoKitty, doesn\u2019t that mean it\u2019s an SEC violation? The situation is littered with contradictions.Still not getting it? Let\u2019s look at something that SEC regulators and all the other fat cats on Capitol Hill can relate to: golf memberships. One of the charges the SEC laid on the now-defunct Munchee ICO was a claim that there was not an immediate use for the token. Back to golf memberships. A lot of golf memberships are sold to fund new golf courses and many of them are re-saleable prior to the golf course\u2019s grand opening. Moreover, the membership owner neither has possession nor controls the golf course. So why is the SEC handicapped in this situation?5 Actions the SEC Could Take Regarding ICOsThese aren\u2019t easy questions to answer but after reviewing several SEC documents and Mr. Clayton\u2019s statements, I am going to lay out 5 actions I believe the SEC will take in the next 6 months.The SEC will accept ICOs as a legitimate fund-raising vehicle. I know there have been a lot of noise in the crypto community about shutting down legitimate ICOs, but I am confident this will not happen. Clayton\u2019s comment on this reinforces my belief:It is possible to conduct an ICO without triggering the SEC\u2019s registration requirements. For example, just as with a Regulation D exempt offering to raise capital for the manufacturing of a physical product, an initial coin offering that is a security can be structured so that it qualifies for an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.The SEC will shut down hundreds of past, current and future ICOs in one big sweep. In may not be a midnight raid, but I suspect they will send hundreds of cease and desist letters within the next 6 months.The SEC will develop an update to the Howey test to help guide future ICOs on whether they should be classified as a security or a utility token. Clayton recently hinted at this a few times and most recently:When advising clients, designing products and engaging in transactions, market participants and their advisers should thoughtfully consider our laws, regulations and guidance, as well as our principles-based securities law framework, which has served us well in the face of new developments for more than 80 years. I also encourage market participants and their advisers to engage with the SEC staff to aid in their analysis under the securities laws.The SEC will come down extremely hard on companies that are actively promoting the future value of utility tokens. Incidentally, if you\u2019re thinking about doing an ICO, one way to protect yourself is to email the SEC staff at [email protected] and ask for guidance.The SEC will fine or shut down the worst offending platforms, brokers, and dealers and provide guidance to those that appear to be acting in good faith. Clayton warned about this action in his memo:Similarly, I also caution those who operate systems and platforms that effect or facilitate transactions in these products that they may be operating unregistered exchanges or broker-dealers that are in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Can the SEC Regulate Bitcoin? Cryptoassets' Legal Questions (Tentatively) Answered https://t.co/PwGpqwE9nF #CryptoRegulation #CryptoRuling\u2014 Crypto Ruling (@CryptoRuling) December 17, 2017Summing It All UpSo far, the SEC has played a measured and positive role in helping manage this complexity. What it should not do is constrain the actions of this developing market by being overzealous. Judging by Clayton\u2019s opinions on the matter, it appears the SEC is supportive:We at the SEC are committed to promoting capital formation. The technology on which cryptocurrencies and ICOs are based may prove to be disruptive, transformative and efficiency enhancing. I am confident that developments in Fintech will help facilitate capital formation and provide promising investment opportunities for institutional and Main Street investors alike.In the final analysis, the SEC appears to be on board with change and they are stepping in to protect main street investors. ICOs are reaching a dangerous frenzy on the scale that we haven\u2019t witnessed since the Dotcom Bubble, driven by inexperienced investors trying to make a quick buck. If the SEC provides clear guidance and drains out the \u201cpump and dump\u201d schemes, we\u2019ll have a healthy, entrepreneurial alternative to Wall Street and venture capitalists.Note: Bitcoinist has reached out to the SEC for further comments, however, they have yet to respond.Do you think that the SEC will ever accept ICOs as a fund-raising vehicle?

It has weathered scandal, regulatory crackdowns, internal strife, a drawerful of forks, and the usual barrage of criticism and accusations and has managed to dust itself off and come back stronger than ever. In 2017 alone, Bitcoin has had record gains, climbing from just over $960 at the beginning of the year to its current value of around $19,200 \u2013 an increase of over 1900%. It\u2019s current market cap of $321.9 billion make the digital currency worth more than all but ten of the S&P 500 companies. In fact, at press time, the only companies in the index with a market cap higher than that of Bitcoin are Apple, Alphabet A, Alphabet Inc C, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire Hathaway, Johnson & Johnson, JP Morgan Chase, and Exxon Mobil.With the digital currency\u2019s incredible performance this year, coupled the launch of bitcoin futures trading on CBOE, CME Group, and TD Ameritrade, it\u2019s no wonder that businesses are taking a closer look at it and are beginning to accept Bitcoin payments. The only real question is why haven\u2019t they done it sooner? Back in July, the president of Medici Ventures, Overstock.com\u2019s parent company, told Business Insider, \u201c[It\u2019s] crazy that so many retailers don\u2019t accept bitcoin.\u201dIt is estimated that several hundred thousand businesses around the world accept Bitcoin, with more coming online every day.

Shortly before the Winklevoss\u2019 efforts, the SolidX Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund was also turned down by the SEC. In both instances, the volatility of the underlying asset as well as the perceived lack of regulation in the sector was blamed for the agency\u2019s decision.The Winklevoss application is still reportedly under review, but it has been under review since April and (as of December 2017) we\u2019ve seen no progress made towards a resolution.That is, perhaps, until now.Futures Have Paved The Way For An ETFWith the advent of Bitcoin futures becoming available as tradable assets on mainstream US exchanges (first, through the CBOE listing that just took place and second, the CME Group listing that\u2019s set to take place at the end of this week), the chances of the SEC in the US green-lighting a bitcoin ETF just increased dramatically.And this isn\u2019t going unnoticed in mainstream media.According to an article published today in The Wall Street Journal, there is a crucial difference to the way any such SEC approved ETF would work, however, as compares to the structure that the Winklevoss twins went after and subsequently had turned down earlier this year \u2013 the ETF would use bitcoin futures as a derivative asset, as opposed to bitcoin itself.What Is An ETF?For anyone unfamiliar with the concept of an ETF, they are an index type asset that is designed to represent the price fluctuations of an underlying asset \u2013 more often than not, a commodity. With a gold ETF, as the price of gold rises, so should the price of the ETF. The same is true in reverse.The difference between a bitcoin ETF and a bitcoin futures ETF, therefore, would be that the price of the ETF would be much more representative of speculative expectations, based on the fact that the futures pricing would be expectations based (as opposed to a major exchange daily clearing price, for example).Regardless of the intricacies, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Winklevoss twins had another go at their application with the SEC very near term.What do you think about the chances of a bitcoin ETF hitting markets?

She thinks that the digital currency\u2019s potential risk is limited. Therefore, Bitcoin is incapable of affecting financial markets. Yellen made her comments during her final press conference, on December 13, 2017.U.S. Federal Reserve Does Not Regulate BitcoinJanet Yellen, throughout her tenure as Federal Reserve Chair, had not made many references about the cryptocurrency. However, now that she is about to leave her position, in her last press conference, while announcing an increase in U.S. interest rates, she surprisingly mentioned Bitcoin.Specifically, Yellen referred to Bitcoin as a \u201chighly speculative asset,\u201d and that \u201cit does not constitute legal tender.\u201d Moreover, she indicated that the cryptocurrency is \u201cnot a stable store of value.\u201dIn this regard, she concurs with her colleague New York Fed President William Dudley who also doubts that Bitcoin is a good store of value. According to Bloomberg, last month, Dudley expressed his skepticism about Bitcoin, saying \u201cI would be, at this point, pretty skeptical of bitcoin. I think it\u2019s really more of a speculative activity.\u201dHowever, the good news is that Yellen does not seem to view the cryptocurrency as an imminent threat to the U.S. financial system. She declared:Bitcoin at this time plays a very small role in the payment system.Central Bankers Are Still Skeptical About CryptocurrenciesYellen\u2019s tenure as Fed Chair ends in February 2018. Her comments about the cryptocurrency do not differ from those expressed by her peers.For example, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe, referring to Bitcoin\u2019s current \u201cfascination,\u201d said that it \u201cfeels more like speculative mania than it has to do with their use\u201d as a form of payment.Similarly, the European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi also considers that cryptocurrencies are immature. As CNBC reported, Draghi said:Cryptocurrencies are not \u2018mature\u2019 enough to be considered by the European Central Bank (ECB) for regulation.A few days ago, Former Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan also dismissed the digital currency. Greenspan said, \u201cBitcoin is not rational,\u201d and compared it with a fiat currency that the U.S. Continental Congress minted in 1775 to finance the American revolutionary war effort.Bitcoin and its blockchain technology are a threat to the three-thousand-year-old monetary system and the unfair, obsolete banking system. Understandably, their representatives scorn or downplay cryptocurrencies. And most likely, they will never change their minds. Nevertheless, with a growth of over 1,700 percent in one year, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will continue to grow and eventually challenge the current fiat monetary system.Do you think that Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s departure will have an effect on Bitcoin?

Yet there\u2019s more than one way to skin a cat, so they say. A man in New Jersey learned the hard way to choose his friends more carefully as he was kidnapped at gunpoint and forced to give up the password to his digital wallet, which contained $1.8 million in Ether.Not Much of a FriendThe victim, who has remained unnamed, was visiting the apartment of his friend, 35-year-old Louis Meza. When the victim decided to leave, Meza supposedly called for a ride (such as Uber) to come pick him up. Instead, an accomplice of Meza arrived in a minivan, and when the victim entered the vehicle, the accomplice pulled out a gun and held him at gunpoint.The victim was then forced to hand over his keys, cell phone, and wallet. He was also forced to give up the password to his digital wallet that contained his Ether. Meza then went into the victim\u2019s apartment and was caught on surveillance cameras removing a box that supposedly contained the digital wallet. Luckily, the victim managed to escape at that time and called 911.The Not-So-Perfect CrimeThe wallet contained a whopping $1.8 million in Ether, and Meza reportedly moved the cryptocurrency into his own wallet, which fully transferred the following day. Police arrested Louis Meza and charged him with robbery in the first degree, computer trespass, kidnapping in the second degree, grand larceny in the first degree, criminal use of a firearm in the first degree, and some additional minor charges. The accomplice has, so far, evaded police.Meza has entered a plea of not guilty, but if he is convicted, the most serious charges have a sentence of up to 25 years in prison. Currently, he is held on a million dollar bond or $500,000 cash bail.The victim is a lucky guy, even though he has horrible taste in friends. It\u2019s highly likely that Meza and his accomplice would have killed him once the theft was complete as no criminal would leave a living witness behind after stealing $1.8 million from them. This just goes to show you to be careful who you trust and perhaps not brag about being a crypto millionaire. On a side note, you would think the guy with almost $2 million in Ether could afford to buy a car of his own.What do you think about the New Jersey man being robbed of $1.8 million in Ether?

This week, however, it seems as though two of the most influential and powerful entities in the region have taken steps towards validating the technology and its place in regional and international monetary framework.Well, validating the utility of the technology, that is.A Multi-National Banking CryptocurrencyOn December 13, 2017, reports hit the press that two of the middle eastern superpowers, are teaming up to create and issue a digital currency. The two powers in question are the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia and, specifically, it will be the central bank of each that get together and build out the framework for the issue.According to reports, the digital currency to be created will be based on blockchain technology (hence our argument that the move goes some way to validate cryptocurrency) and it\u2019s designed, primarily, as a tool that can facilitate cross-border transactions between the two countries.The UAE and Saudi Arabia already have a very well established and large-scale import/export relationship with one another. Saudi Arabia exports to the UAE total $6.74 billion annually, with the reverse figure (exports from the UAE to Saudi Arabia) total $8.5 billion.The friction created when using cash, even digital cash, as a transaction method has long been an issue with cross-border payments and, when aggregate volume totals tops $15.2 billion annually, these frictions amplify. As such, the transfer to a blockchain based cryptocurrency makes sense \u2013 even in a region that has, to date, been somewhat unsupportive of the technology.Here\u2019s what Mubarak Rashed al-Mansouri, the governor of the Central Bank of the UAE, had to say on the development:This is the first times the monetary authorities of two countries cooperation to use blockchain technology\u2026 It is digitization of what we do already between central banks and banks [sic].How this will impact the use of cryptocurrency by individuals within these regions remains to be seen. As things stand, the development relates only to central bank transactions. Over time, however, a relaxed governmental attitude towards cryptocurrency could filter through to the general public.What are your views?

These include core improvements, hard forks, and recognition by institutional exchanges such as CBOE, CME, and Nasdaq. The more mainstream it becomes the bigger the FOMO (fear of missing out), and those driving the momentum in 2018 will be millennials.According to a report in the Independent, one in three millennials will be investing in cryptocurrencies by the end of next year. Millennials are defined by demographers and researchers as those born between the early 1980s to just after 2000. This generation grew up with technology so cryptocurrencies will be right up their alley.Youth Gone WildResearch by London based crypto exchange London Block Exchange revealed that 5% of those aged below 35 already have money invested in cryptocurrencies and a further 11% are planning to invest next year. The younger generation is signaling a shift from traditional investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds or even real estate. The study went on to reveal that a further 17% would seriously consider investing in cryptocurrencies by the end of 2018.With UK property prices escalating beyond the reach of many and the government repeatedly increasing the retirement age, pensions and property are no longer viewed as attractive investments. LBX Founder and CEO Benjamin Dives stated:\u201cThis study underlines the gulf between the younger generation\u2019s view of money and that of their parents and grandparents, who had assets perform so well for them in pensions or property. Millennials clearly feel left behind by the old system and are looking at cryptocurrencies as a new dawn,\u201dIf this does happen it will make cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, plus their siblings, a more popular investment asset among this generation than shares, bonds, commodities or a second property. The study revealed that 24% of those surveyed regretted not buying into cryptocurrencies earlier after seeing their values soar throughout 2017.Crypto What?Unsurprisingly 57% of those aged over 55 said that they are not interested in investing in cryptocurrencies. Without some technical knowledge and inclinations, it can be a steep learning curve that the majority of the older generation simply does not want to climb.Cryptocurrency expert at the University of Cambridge, Garrick Hileman, stated that banks and traditional financial institutions have struggled to reach out to millennials:\u201cMillennials began their income generating years during the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, and many don\u2019t completely trust traditional financial services firms or the system in which they operate,\u201dMore investment next year means only one thing for crypto and that is good news for anyone that has got in this year.Will you be investing in cryptocurrencies in 2018?

Now the Venezuelan government is requiring bitcoin miners to join an online registry.It seems that the misery of the Venezuelan people knows no end. The South American country\u2019s economy has been hammered by massive hyperinflation due to the policies of the authoritarian government, now headed by President Nicolas Maduro. Many people, both poor and rich, have turned to mining Bitcoin in order to survive. Now a further clampdown is coming as the Venezuelan government is requiring bitcoin miners to join an online registry.Sign Up \u2026 Or ElseThe announcement of the new registry was made at a recent press conference by Carlos Vargas, the newly appointed \u201csuperintendent of Venezuelan cryptocurrency.\u201d Bitcoin miners will have to start registering with the government on December 22nd when the online registry goes live.Of the information that the government is looking for, Vargas says:We want to know who they are, we want to know where they are, we want to know what equipment they are using.Those in favor of the registry say that it will offer legal protections to bitcoin miners. Currently, the government has been cracking down on miners, such as the recent police raid on December 9th that saw the confiscation of 21 mining computers and the arrest of their 31-year-old owner. The police have charged the bitcoin miner with exchange fraud, computer crimes, damage to the national electric system, financing terrorism, and money laundering. (I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t throw in jaywalking while they were at it.)What Could Go Wrong?The people of Venezuela have been hammered by the socialist economic policies of the country\u2019s last few administrations. Basic necessities, such as food and medical supplies, are non-existent, and inflation has reached over 4000% this year. Such circumstances have forced people to turn to Bitcoin in order to get the items they need to actually survive, and the situation is not getting any better. Weekly bitcoin trading in Venezuela has skyrocketed from $225,000 early in the year to a staggering $2.1 million in the first week of December.As soon as the people turned to bitcoin mining, extortion and theft by the authorities have happened. Many individuals have had their mining rigs confiscated by police and federal authorities, only to have those authorities use the machines to mine bitcoins for themselves. One miner recently gave up 11 of his 20 machines in lieu of a $20,000 bribe, and insult has been added to injury as the officials who stole his machines now contact him for technical advice.So, what could go wrong with an online registry for bitcoin miners? The most obvious is that the government will be able to do a mass confiscation once a full list has been compiled. The government of Venezuela has nationalized (forcibly taken over) hundreds of businesses, which has led to the vast majority of them failing.As David Fernando Lopez Torres, who moved his mining farm from Venezuela to San Francisco, notes:If I were still in Venezuela, there\u2019s no way I would sign up. If they weren\u2019t protecting miners\u2019 rights without a registry, how can they trust that they would protect their rights with a registry? First they need to publicize what the registry will be used for, because we can\u2019t trust their intentions.The likely result of the new online registry is that the majority of bitcoin miners will move even further underground. You would have to be stark-raving mad to believe that a corrupt government will honor any agreement to allow bitcoin miners to legally operate in peace. Either new taxes will be imposed upon the miners or the government will outright confiscate the equipment. Either way, the government will take the bounty of bitcoin mining for themselves.A dictatorial president, a national government who has seized hundreds of legal businesses, economic policies that have ravaged the country, and massive corruption all point to a really bad outcome for those who sign up for the registry. But at least Venezuela will have the Petro, their own national cryptocurrency!What do you think about the compulsory registry for bitcoin miners in Venezuela? Would you sign up?

While some fall victim to poorly designed business plans and/or faulty adoption strategies, many altcoins are the product of outright scams. One thing they all have in common, however, is their attempt to emulate the success of Bitcoin. Very few altcoins have managed to ignite the kind of interest that propels a cryptocurrency from a mere novelty to something that captures the attention of industry giants and world leaders.What\u2019s so Great About Bitcoin Anyway?2017 has been a banner year for Bitcoin. In December alone, the digital currency posted gains of more than 65%, starting the month trading at just under $10,000 and \u2013 after a brief spike into the $18,000 range \u2013 settling into the $16,000 \u2013 $16,500 range at press time. Overall YTD gains for Bitcoin, which started out the year at around $960.00, are even more impressive at over 1600%.What makes the recent price hikes in Bitcoin not only feasible, but sustainable as well, is the tidal wave of buying demand being realized with a limited and finite supply of bitcoins, as cryptocurrencies, a digital asset, entering the mainstream. This tidal wave has investors looking to diversify into other currencies in the hopes of getting in early on the \u201cnext\u201d Bitcoin. Unfortunately, with the crypto-space glutted as it is with so many altcoins, it isn\u2019t always easy to separate the coins with real potential from those with a slick marketing campaign but which tend to fizzle once they get listed on exchanges.Why So Many Altcoins FailWhere cryptocurrencies as a whole currently fall short is in institutional support. Consider the mainstream financial sector for a moment. With conventional offerings like IPOs (Initial Public Offerings), once a company\u2019s shares are listed on a stock exchange, they are usually supported by \u201cmarket makers\u201d.In fact, many exchanges \u2013 including the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq \u2013 require that each IPO have at least 3 or 4 market makers. The purpose of a market maker is to buy and sell shares of a company\u2019s stock throughout the day to stimulate trading of that stock. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan Chase are all examples of market makers.In a peer to peer decentralized system, there is no equivalent support mechanism. As a result, most ICOs wither upon listing because nobody is actually focused on price support or stability.How One ICO is Doing it RightSo how can a company offer price support and stability to a coin post-ICO without a conventional market maker in a peer to peer decentralized system?They can take a page from 4NEW\u2018s playbook. 4NEW is a blockchain-based Waste to Energy platform whose entire business model is reverse engineered for aftermarket price stability and liquidity in its coin, without the need for market makers. They have already successfully raised more than $30 Million in institutional funding through conventional means to build a Waste to Energy plant and have recently launched their crowdsale where they are seeking to raise $9.5 million. There are currently just 2 days remaining until the end of their ICO.The Waste to Energy plant that 4NEW will be building not only solves two important social and environmental concerns, those of waste surplus and energy shortfall, it also ensures widespread adoption of FRNCoin (4NEW\u2019s cryptocurrency).Once completed, all sales generated from the Waste to Energy plant will take place on the 4NEW blockchain with the ability to make and accept timed payments between businesses. Additionally, because adoption of FRNCoin is already being established well in advance of the launch of the first plant, a strong foundation of demand is being \u201cbaked\u201d into the coin, offering pricing stability and consistent liquidity.Beginning in 2018, FRNCoin is set to be accepted by a growing network of businesses in the Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals, Health Insurance, Telecommunications, Credit Card processing, and Money Transfer Services industries. New businesses and industries are expected to be added continuously throughout the year. When consumers purchase the FRNCoin to avail the goods and services offered by these businesses, an organic demand will be generated in the coin that is focused on utility and not on speculative trading. This organic demand will bring new liquidity into the marketplace for the coin, offering price support.As a result, there will always be consumers making a market for the coin, replacing the market making function offered by institutions. Since conventional institutional support is not suited for a peer to peer decentralized system, there needs to be the kind of peer to peer market making \u2013 like that of 4NEW \u2013 that supports the coin\u2019s price without engaging in speculative trading.As 4NEW continues to add more business consumers to its coin, a Top-Down approach to widespread adoption and utilization will begin. This will permeate through to the masses over time, leading to another successful cryptocurrency very similar to Bitcoin. In fact, the only real difference between Bitcoin and 4NEW is their adoption approach.Bitcoin experienced a Bottom-UP path to adoption where, by virtue of the people (the crypto community) adopting the coin, businesses found themselves having to adopt it as well in order to stay competitive. This methodology takes longer, however, it has also given the community an awareness and wider acceptance of cryptocurrency today.Like Bitcoin, 4NEW will act like a store of value over time, however, it utilizes the Top-Down approach to adoption. A market for the adoption of its FRNCoin is already being established across several industries so that, at the conclusion of the ICO, token holders will be able to use the coin as a means of payment. The credibility of this offering is further cemented by the company\u2019s recent affiliation with the Imperial College of London, a 110-year old academic institution with a pedigree track record.Nobody can guarantee the future performance of any token or ICO project, of course, but 4NEW appears to show all the signs of becoming a lasting example for future success stories within the cryptocurrency community.What do you think of 4NEW\u2019s market making strategy? Would a similar system help shore up and stabilize other cryptocurrencies?

The week of December 18, 2017, it will unveil its Token Store. The Store will be a marketplace that sells the tokens of interesting ICO projects to participants at a 30-75% discount. There will be no upper or lower limits on the number of tokens that can be acquired by users.Your One-Stop Token ShopThose who wish to use the Token Store will have to register using their ICOS token ID on the Token Store secure platform. Once they are registered, they can deposit cryptocurrencies on their accounts. The wallets currently accept BTC, ICOS or ETH. When tokens that the users wish to acquire appear on the marketplace, they can exchange the cryptocurrencies in their wallets for the tokens. Participants will then be able to withdraw the tokens from the platform, subject to KYC verification. This is a standard legal requirement and involves the user giving his full legal name, address and a copy of official identification documents.ICOBox Co-Founder Daria Generalova states:The Token Store is all about making quality tokens more accessible to token holders. We plan to thoroughly scrutinize ICO projects before selecting them for the Store. Some of the factors we will consider include whether the project is set to be successful in its ICO, whether it has met its stated financial targets (for example, having already reached the soft cap), and whether the project includes an escrow account where funds can be stored for at least two months, pending the completion of its ICO. Due to our hard work up front, users can rest assured that, no matter their choice, they will be receiving a first-class token.The new tokens remain on the marketplace for a month, and any unsold tokens are returned to the issuer. Varying discounts may be provided by the ICO projects, up to and including the highest discount, which requires that buyers wait at least 24 hours before withdrawing the newly acquired tokens assigned to them from the platform.The founders of ICOBox trust that this new service will create synergetic effects for all parties involved.About ICOBoxICOBox was established in July 2017 with the goal of providing SaaS and turnkey ICO services to blockchain-based projects. Soon thereafter, ICOBox conducted its own ICO and collected 4,000 BTC. Ever since, the project has been organizing ICOs, and to date, its clients have collected over $200 million, which they will spend to bring their state-of-the-art products and services to the market.For more information about ICOBox and its services, please visit icobox.io.What do you think of a discount marketplace for ICO tokens?

According to Bloomberg, trading in the digital currency increased exponentially more in countries with developing economies than their more developed counterparts, although the volume of trading was far less.A Possible Reason for This GrowthThe common denominator for this surge: these countries have been harsh with their criticism of, and regulations with regard to, Bitcoin and the crypto industry in general.Central banks in both China and Russia have banned local exchange trading. The Venezuelan government has put strict regulations in place against Bitcoin mining, while Brazilian and Colombian citizens have been receiving cautionary tales of the dangers of crypto.Spencer Bogart, who is the head of research at Blockchain Capital LLC in San Francisco, had this to say:The strong interest from emerging-market countries could be reflective of relatively less stable local currencies or a byproduct of greater exposure to financial and economic crises that makes an alternative system like Bitcoin relatively appealing.His comments make sense as cryptocurrencies don\u2019t have anyone to answer to. There are no banks, governments, or single entities in charge that can force digital currencies to conform to any sort of process. It also offers a global currency option for users.In addition, because Bitcoin has a cap of 21 billion bitcoins, inflation is a non-issue. Unlike fiat currency, the government won\u2019t be able to print more bitcoins, which would increase inflation.Phenomenal Growth in Emerging MarketsAccording to data on LocalBitcoins, peer-to-peer trading grew by more 2,000% in China, almost 200% in Russia, and approximately 20% in the US.Countries south of the equator don\u2019t want to be left out in the crypto cold either. LocalBitcoins shows an almost 1,500% increase in Nigeria\u2019s peer-to-peer trading, which could be as a result of the country\u2019s naira weakening by 12.4% this year. Venezuela saw growth of nearly 1,000%. Reasons for this include high levels of inflation that has resulted in a weaker local currency, as well as governments tightening their purse strings on access to the US dollar.This growth resulted in a trading volume of about $115 million for Nigeria and $50 million for Venezuela. Even though the trading volumes of these developing markets are increasing, China and Russia combined still account for approximately 40% of the market.Depending on the country, the price of a single Bitcoin can differ drastically. In Nigeria, it was trading at over 15% more than in the US. An increased price was also evident in Russia and Argentina, while Colombia, Singapore, and Brazil actually saw a lower price.No Bitcoin for YouBack to wanting what you can\u2019t have. Last month, Brazil\u2019s central bank said:[Cryptocurrencies] are neither issued nor guaranteed by any monetary authority, there is no guarantee that they can be converted to a sovereign currency and they are not backed by any kind of real asset.Something to note: peer-to-peer trading in Brazil increased by 450% this year.Columbia had similar comments and added that cryptocurrency disrupts financial stability. However, the country\u2019s peso had depreciated by over 3% in as many months. That doesn\u2019t sound very stable.Turkey and India have also warned its citizens about the supposed dangers that crypto offers.Cause and EffectEven though it seems as if government regulations are what\u2019s driving Bitcoin\u2019s popularity and price, it could be the result rather than the cause. People could be buying more crypto to circumvent their government\u2019s cash controls, which in turn results in said government putting regulations in place.However, the disruptive nature of decentralized digital currencies is definitely a concern for traditional currencies. Simon Quijano-Evans, an emerging-market strategist at Legal & General Investment Management Ltd., said:Cryptocurrencies stand as a potential challenge to the millennia of confidence-building measures that have gone into the construction of fiat currency.This is most likely the reason that these developing countries are aggressively working towards a total cryptocurrency crackdown. However, this seems to result in an equally aggressive, and continued, increase in the popularity and price of digital currencies.However, it\u2019s not just negative press that could be responsible for this increase. Bitcoin\u2019s growing futures market has also helped the price rise, with it surpassing the $17K mark once CBOE started trading their Bitcoin futures. CME will start trading on the 18th of December, with Nasdaq launching their product next year.Do you think government crackdowns are what\u2019s driving the crypto price up in some countries?

Action is likely to heat up over the weekend as two more US exchanges launch their BTC futures contracts. This week has also shown some clear winners in the altcoin race, and one of them has been Ripple.Ripple (XRP) has shown little movement over the past three months trading in a channel between $0.18 and $0.26, barely mustering enough momentum to break out either way. News that over 60 banks in Japan and South Korea will begin testing inter-bank transfers using the Ripple blockchain sent the altcoin soaring on December 13. It surged to an all-time high of $0.86 the following day and analysts forecast it would break the dollar soon. For the past 24 hours, XRP has maintained its position and is currently trading around $0.77, up over 200% this week.New HiresThe pump in price and volume took Ripple to the fourth spot in the market cap with $29.8 billion, just behind Bitcoin Cash at $30.8 billion. In response, the company behind the cryptocurrency hired Tom Channick, who previously served as a corporate communications manager for Facebook\u2019s advertising and business integrity unit. Channick will serve as head of communications for the San Francisco based blockchain company.In an email to Markets Insider Channick said:I am honored to join Ripple, and very much look forward to working with the global team to continue to build the internet of value. Developing technology that lets people and businesses move money as fast as information is incredibly important, and I\u2019m excited to help Ripple achieve that goal.Speedy BankingThe concept behind Ripple is to speed up and streamline financial transactions and global payments. Most banks currently use an archaic network called SWIFT which can result in international transfers taking days and accruing heavy fees. By using the XRP cryptocurrency, bank transactions will be a lot faster, more efficient and cheaper to conduct.Many ideologically driven crypto traders have shunned Ripple because it has these close links to the traditional banking system. Those that stuck with it and invested in XRP over the past couple of months are currently reaping the benefits as it has tripled in value over the past week.When will XRP break the dollar?

At the start of next week, on December 18, CME Group Inc., another large regulated exchange and a major competitor to CBOE, will do the same.It seems, however, and as underlined by the latest reports out of Goldman, that the banks that clear these trades won\u2019t be nearly as lenient with regards to lending facilities as they are when it comes to futures based on more traditional underlying assets \u2013 things like gold, silver, corn, etc\u2026Goldman Sachs wanting 100% margin on Bitcoin reveals their expectation of the bitcoin to perform higher next year. #GOLDMANSACHS #outofreaach #BitcoinFutures https://t.co/qPsIyaFad8\u2014 Est\u00e8lle (@Alibaba_GP) December 15, 2017What Does This Mean, Exactly?When an exchange offers a futures contract, it\u2019s a contract that stipulates the trader must fulfill the trade a certain fixed price on a certain fixed, date in the future. Said trader can use these contracts to play the market depending on his or her prediction as to where the price of the underlying asset will be on the future date in question.While it\u2019s the exchanges offering the asset, banks are generally used as clearinghouses, which are a sort of intermediary between buyers and sellers of financial instruments.An ExampleGenerally, people who trade in futures will do so using margin, which allows them to command a much larger position in the underlying asset that their upfront capital would allow. For example, a $1 million margin payment on a 10X leveraged position would mean allow the trader to command $10 million worth of the underlying asset \u2013 in this instance, bitcoin.Instead of the exchange providing this margin (and, in turn, taking the risk that the trader can\u2019t pay up once the trade completes), it\u2019s (normally) the clearinghouse.So, in line with the above reports, Goldman Sachs is refusing to allow certain traders to trade on margin at all (i.e. requiring all $10 million upfront in the above example) or is requiring much higher percentage down payment (50%, 75% etc.) than it would if the futures contract was rooted in gold.It\u2019s not all that surprising, given the nascent state of this industry and the asset in question but it does serve to illustrate the uncertainty surrounding the future of Bitcoin from an institutional perspective.Do you trade on margin? Should banks require a higher margin until Bitcoin stabilizes? Let us know in the comments below!Images courtesy of AP, PexelsThe Rundown What Does This Mean, Exactly?An Example"}

Day by day, more people are getting interested and involved in crypto. The geeky community that supported crypto through the first steps is being joined \u2013 and possibly supplanted \u2013 by ordinary people that don\u2019t have a deep understanding about blockchain technologies and have either come to this space for speculative purposes or followed a new project whose ICO they stumbled on. This article is for the latter group, we want to take a look at the wallet options available for the storage of and interaction with cryptocurrencies.Cryptocurrency Wallet: The What and The HowCryptocurrency transactions have a lot in common with other forms of electronic payments. They require a minimum of two online accounts, accounts that are capable of holding, sending and receiving funds. The difference between a cryptocurrency account, most commonly called the wallet and a bank account or an e-wallet is mainly in the way transactions are performed.Whenever you access your bank account, you are basically asking your bank to tell you how much money you have. The same goes with sending money to someone. You log in and ask your bank to send your money to someone else and you trust that they will do so timely and accurately. When it comes to cryptocurrencies, you are not asking a third party (like a bank). Your wallet gets its information directly from the blockchain, so no third party is involved. You are in control of your own money. Much like a real wallet where you would hold cash, a crypto wallet belongs to the one holding access keys to it.There are three types of cryptocurrency wallets that are most commonly used today:Web/Online wallets \u2013 These wallets are not \u201ctied\u201d to a device, they exist on the internet and can be accessed through any device as long as you have your access credentials. Although very user-friendly, these types of wallets are considered to be the least protected because information about them is stored at a third party and is more likely to be compromised.Desktop/Mobile wallets \u2013 Mobile and desktop wallets are essentially applications that you download and install on your device. You can access these wallets from that device only but if the device is lost or broken you may restore your wallet from on another device. These are considered to be more secure than web wallets but the safety of your funds depends on how secure your device is.Hardware wallets \u2013 Hardware wallets are becoming the go-to solution for storing larger amounts of crypto. Essentially they are encrypted devices that hold your private keys. In order to access your wallet, you have to plug in the device into a desktop computer and run an application which will only be accessible when the device is plugged in.Let\u2019s review some examples:Blockchain.infoThis well known and highly trusted web solution allows access from any browser or device. Two stages of authentication and pin code take care of the data security, but the service is highly prone to downtimes.MyceliumMycelium is a mobile solution. The user has complete control over their cryptocurrency transfers and access to such advanced features as cold storage, PDF backups, QR code scanner etc. We must note, nonetheless, that Mycelium has a really high entrance threshold \u2013 its user must have a solid understanding of cryptocurrency operations and blockchain technology first.ExodusExodus offers a desktop digital wallet that provides the opportunity to store, exchange and trade different cryptocurrencies. Thanks to its intuitive interface and high level of security, Exodus (launched in 2016) quickly gained significant momentum with cryptocurrency users. It is however NOT an open source solution, meaning malicious code could potentially be added by its developers.Ledger Nano SThe Ledger Nano S is a battery-less device which you can connect to any Windows, Mac, and Chrome OS computer (and some Linux systems) via USB. It has a sleek and attractive design. Some of its core features are the ability to backup your seed key for recovery, easy to use OLED interface, and a flash drive like feel with two buttons on the side for navigating the interface.The NAGA WalletNAGA Wallet is a solution provided by the NAGA Group that enables the safe and simple exchange of cryptocurrencies and digital money.

South African citizens have to submit a (hopefully) true and honest financial declaration, which could result, depending on the information given, in said citizens paying SARS a certain amount of money. However, this information is also used for verification purposes to see if a person lies about their income.Banks and other financial institutions are also required to give SARS their clients\u2019 investment information in order to verify their declaration. This is where it gets interesting. As with most countries, South Africa does not have any regulations or processes in place with regard to cryptocurrencies and any possible gains due to the virtual currency rising in value. Essentially, they will just have to rely on South Africans being honest about how much profit they\u2019ve made off of crypto.Uncle SARS Wants You\u2026 to Declare Your CryptosSeeing as SARS banks on this information, and resultant funds, to keep revenue flowing for the South African government, it stands to reason that they would like to be able to track crypto trading. According to Moneyweb, this is exactly what they plan on doing. Dr Randall Carolissen, SARS group executive for research, had this to say:As you can imagine it is very difficult \u2013 the blockchain technology. Without revealing too much, we are talking to some of the top technology companies in the world that [are] doing similar work for Canada and the UK, and we are hoping to get that technology.He went on to add:At the moment, we are treating cryptocurrency in the same way as capital realisation, so in other words, it is like a Krugerrand. If you buy it at a particular point and you then sell it, you will be faced with a capital appreciation and then we will treat it as Capital Gains Tax.SARS is taking it one step further by teaming up with the country\u2019s reserve bank (SARB) to evaluate cash flow, so as to determine if the amount of money leaving the country matches the amount of goods coming into the country. The institution is also working with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to put a system in place.Blockchain-Based Technology Will Be UsedIn July this year, Loerien Gamaroff, who is the CEO of South African blockchain-based solutions provider Bankymoon, confirmed that they were in discussions to test these possible new regulations. He had this to say at the time:All we are doing at this point is seeing how far this relationship will go on within this sandbox. This is because the Reserve Bank is very hesitant to give a stamp of approval on anything that comes out. The sandbox will only be Bitcoin-focused during this initial phase, but is focused on applying broad regulations to all cryptocurrencies.South Africa is the latest emerging market that will be implementing crypto regulations. However, it seems to be more of a self-preserving effort for SARS to ensure that the country\u2019s revenue doesn\u2019t disappear with the country\u2019s increase in crypto trading.Do you think more countries will follow suit by applying crypto regulations?

The crypto angle is that around $60,000 of that amount was in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.Aiding and AbettingThe woman in question is Zoobia Shahnaz, a 27-year old lab technician who was born in Pakistan but is an American citizen. Authorities arrested her in her home on Long Island Wednesday evening, and she was then remanded into custody the following day in order to stand trial in January.Shahnaz is accused of sending more than $150,000 to help ISIS via shell companies in China, Pakistan, and Turkey. Of the $150,000 she sent, roughly $85,000 was done by scamming banks. She got a fraudulent loan for $22,500 and then converted the credit on six credit cards into $60,000 of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.Court documents state:She then made several wire transactions to individuals and opaque entities in Pakistan, China and Turkey, which were designed to avoid transaction reporting requirements and conceal the identity, source and destination of the illicitly-obtained monies.These transactions were motivated to benefit ISIS, which the defendant ultimately sought to join in Syria.Facing Lots of Prison TimeBefore her attempts to join ISIS, Zoobia Shahnaz earned a good living as a hospital lab technician, making almost $70,000 a year. She had no criminal history but apparently became radicalized online by watching ISIS propaganda videos. Shen spent two weeks with the Syrian American Medical Society in Jordan back in 2016, working part of that time in the Zataari refugee camp, which is known for a heavy ISIS influence.Shahnaz quit her job in June and attempted to travel to Syria at the end of July. She was stopped and questioned as she was found with $9,500 in undeclared cash and with vague answers concerning the details of her trip. Authorities have searched her internet history, finding Google searches for \u201ctop female jihadis,\u201d \u201chow much money can I send through Western Union,\u201d and \u201chijrah (holy migration).\u201dIf convicted, Zoobia Shahnaz faces up to 30 years in prison for bank fraud and up to 20 years for each of the money laundering counts (converting credit cards into Bitcoin).The mainstream news is definitely playing up the Bitcoin angle as it allows them to tie the cryptocurrency to illegal deeds, not to mention that Bitcoin is a hot topic right now. Still, the reality is that any kind of currency can be used for illicit means if the person holding it chooses to use it in such a manner.Do you think the media is playing up this story due to the Bitcoin angle?

Today, they announced support for more cryptocurrencies, starting with implementing Bitcoin Cash to their payment platform and debit cards.BitPay is a point-of-sale company that allows traditional businesses to accept Bitcoin. They provide an easy to use means for users to pay with the popular digital currency, which is especially attractive to businesses that have customer bases that may not be that crypto-literate. BitPay also automatically converts the Bitcoin to the business\u2019s local currency, allowing for the firm to avoid the roller coaster that is Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility and having to deal with setting up secure wallets to store their Bitcoin income. The company also provides software wallets for users and Bitcoin debit cards that can be used in the real world.Businesses Look for Alternatives as Fees RiseOver the past year, fees on the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed. The currency that once had \u201clow fees\u201d as one of their primary incentives to use, has seen average fees go to around $4 to send a transaction with a timely confirmation. During periods of peak use, fees have been seen to go as high as $20 for a simple one input/one output transaction. This is not only due to more users on the network, but also the rising price of Bitcoin. Those satoshis you were paying for fees on a similarly sized transaction a year ago are now worth 17x as much.These fees have caused some companies that have been accepting Bitcoin for years to stop. The biggest one in recent news was Steam, the popular gaming platform for PC gamers. They had been accepting Bitcoin via BitPay since April of 2016, but last week decided to remove Bitcoin from the list of accepted payment methods citing \u201csignificant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network.\u201d as the reason for the removal.BitPay Announces Altcoin SupportToday, BitPay announced plans to support payments across multiple blockchains, starting with Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin that was created back in August of this year. They boast a higher block size and lower fees, as with the fork they upped the block size to 8MB from Bitcoin\u2019s 1MB. BitPay plans on fully activating the change before the end of the year.The announcement was made via BitPay\u2019s blog, which explained their mindset for the decision. Since opening their doors in 2011, BitPay has processed more than $1 billion in payments to date. From the blog post:We\u2019ve received repeated requests from merchants and users over the years to support additional blockchain payment methods. Many of the top alternative cryptocurrencies\u2019 blockchains make their own innovations on the features which have made Bitcoin great for payments. These range from faster transaction confirmations to greater payment privacyThey also made clear that they are not abandoning Bitcoin and will still dedicate resources to developing better systems for Bitcoin payments. Along with this, they\u2019ve stated that along with payments, Bitcoin Cash will be an option for people looking to top up their BitPay Visa debit cards, as well as adding full Bitcoin Cash support to their software wallets.What do you think about the addition of altcoins?
