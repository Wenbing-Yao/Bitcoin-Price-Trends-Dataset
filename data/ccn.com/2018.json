Zannett, who is at the helm of the hedge fund that bears his name, is willing to take bitcoin, Ethereum or Ripple. Zannett told the WSJ \u2013\n\u201cI\u2019m a true believer in these networks, but it\u2019s very volatile.

In true decentralized fashion, it cuts out third-party providers\u00a0at the retailing level as well as for transmission and connectivity services. As a result, the tenants of the BAC would see their energy bill slashed dramatically versus what households and other businesses pay.\n\u201cThe average consumer pays around 28 cents per kilowatt-hour, with what IOT are doing its pre-grid [price] is 8 cents and will be 5 cents at night time,\u201d according to IOT.\nThe power plant was designed as a coal-fired power site with a capacity of 150 megawatts back near the turn of the century, but it\u2019s been offline for the past four years. Hunter wants to switch it over to solar power, reports indicate. Reports also suggest that BAC power consumption could be between 10mw and 20wm.\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s Silicon Valley\u201d\nAs a result,\u00a0Hunter Valley could be transformed into \u201ca new Silicon Valley for Australia\u201d, according to IOT Group\u2019s Sean Neylon quoted in reports, where blockchain companies flock to the region for the attractive rates.\nConsidering the close proximity of BAC to the power grid, blockchain startups could acquire energy at wholesale rates, which is a role reversal in a world where power utilities have been looking to assign higher rates on anything cryptocurrency mining or blockchain related.\nIt sounds like a bitcoin miner\u2019s dream, considering the high energy consumption that\u2019s required to run the computer servers needed to\u00a0produce more coins. Blockchain applications, however, are increasingly being developed across the public and private sectors, which could inspire blockchain-fueled organizations of all kinds to set up shop versus moving to a competing region for cheap power such as Iceland, as Business Insider points out.\nIt\u2019s the maiden project in IOT\u2019s blockchain strategy, and it\u00a0gives\u00a0them the opportunity to dive deeper into the\u00a0Internet of\u00a0Things, they said.

After a minor drop from $7,100 to $6,700, the bitcoin price has been able to sustain its resistance level, rebounding from its decline.\n\nBitcoin to $7,000\nAt this juncture, a potential move to the $7,000 region for bitcoin is likely, given that the dominant cryptocurrency has avoided a further drop from the $6,700 mark to $6,500. On April 9, traders expected the bitcoin price to drop down to the low $6,000 region, if bitcoin dropped to $6,700. But, bitcoin was able to prevent a drop to $6,500 and rebound from that level.\nFor bitcoin investors, a key level to watch is $7,200, as breaking that support level could lead to a potential price surge to $7,500, a level that is still considered as a gateway for bitcoin to the $8,000 region. Bitcoin has avoided a big drop in value by rebounding from its recent price fall.\nWhile the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Williams\u2019 Percent Range point signify oversold conditions for bitcoin, the two momentum oscillators have shown oversold conditions over the past two weeks. Hence, during this period of extreme volatility, the RSI and WPR can be considered as useful indicators, but are not sufficient to predict the price trend of bitcoin.\nExponential Moving Average (EMA) suggests an upward trend in the short-term, if the bitcoin price can hold its current level at $6,850. Volumes on major cryptocurrency exchanges including Bitfinex, Bithumb, and Binance (BTC-to-USDT) remain relatively strong, demonstrating that the demand towards bitcoin is growing slowly.\nFor several weeks already, technical analysis has pointed towards a bear cycle for bitcoin, at least in the short-term. For the most part, that has been true, given that the price of bitcoin has declined from $7,300 to $6,850 within a 7-day period. \nStartups, cryptocurrency exchanges, and institutional investors have begun to take advantage of this bear cycle, to further increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies.\nThis week, Roger Ver revealed a demonstration of South Korea\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb\u2019s digital currency kiosks installed all across South Korea at restaurants, cafes, and stores. The kiosks of Bithumb accept 11 cryptocurrencies listed on the platform, including bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS, Ripple, and more.\n\nThis food ticket vending machine in Korea is accepting Bitcoin Cash thanks to @BithumbOfficial\nLearn more at https://t.co/6EeRmpwLyF pic.twitter.com/0Nm8QnTVak\n\u2014 Roger Ver (@rogerkver) April 10, 2018\nIncreasing Adoption\nAt the moment, in spite of the rapidly growing adoption of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum as legitimate payment methods, it is difficult to spend digital currencies directly at stores and merchants, without secondary products like debit cards.\nIn the mid-term, the installation of cryptocurrency kiosks and ATMs by influential companies like Bithumb to further improve the adoption of cryptocurrencies and allow merchants to directly accept digital currencies will significantly increase the value of cryptocurrencies as decentralized financial networks and a medium of exchange.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Gox trustee. Still, retail investors are seeing a good opportunity to enter the cryptocurrency market.\nInstitutional Demand\nThroughout its 10-year history, bitcoin has had many major corrections. The recent decline from $19,000 to $6,000 was the third worst correction to date, recording a 72 percent drop in value. \nHistory shows that bitcoin has always been able to recover from its major corrections to previous all-time highs and initiate new rallies. Investors like Tom Lee and Peter Thiel have stated that the recent bitcoin correction will be similar to its previous ones, and bitcoin will be able to rebound from its losses in the future.\nTo recover from the recent correction, analysts unanimously agree that the cryptocurrency market will start to see new volumes coming in, from new investors. Lee explained that the new volumes could come from financial institutions and retail investors, as large-scale traders will see an opportunity to invest in the space after a 72 percent drop in prices across the board.\nThis week, Jeremy Gardner, a co-founder of the successful blockchain project Augur, revealed that investors in over-the-counter (OTC) markets are seeking for multi-billion dollar bids, to invest in the most dominant cryptocurrency in the market. \nIn OTC markets, investors often deal with miners or other whale investors that hold significant chunks of bitcoin. Multi-billion dollar bids would not have an immediate impact on the public market or the cryptocurrency exchange market. But, if investors start allocating billions of new dollars into the cryptocurrency market, the bitcoin price will likely increase in the mid-term.\n\u201cOTC market demand for bitcoin right now is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever witnessed. Several ask for multi-billion dollar bids,\u201d said Gardner.\nDisappointment\nSince 2015, the bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets have anticipated the entrance of institutional investors from strictly regulated markets like the bitcoin futures market operated by Cboe and CME Group. But, volumes on those markets have been extremely poor, and the demand from retail traders from the west have been virtually non-existent.\nJon Matonis, a cryptocurrency expert, Visa executive, and co-founder of Bitcoin Foundation, stated that if major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs enter in the near future, it could trigger more institutional investors in the west to enter the cryptocurrency market. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s fabulous that they\u2019re getting into it because it brings in new liquidity. They\u2019re going to develop futures markets, options markets, I even think you\u2019re going to start to see interest rate markets around bitcoin. We\u2019re used to hearing things about Libor, the index for bitcoin interest rates is Bibor,\u201d said Matonis.\nAlready, in Japan and South Korea, retail investors have placed large bids on bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies.\nAt the moment, given bitcoin\u2019s lack of momentum, traders anticipate the price of bitcoin to bottom out in the $6,000 mark. If it does, and bitcoin potentially initiates a corrective rally in the short-term, bitcoin could experience a short-term recovery.", "category": "News"}

That\u2019s a violation of the Texas Securities Act.\nMoreover, a shocking 21 promoters (or two-thirds) failed to provide a physical address for their businesses, so that investors who were defrauded would not be able to locate them to serve them with a lawsuit or seek other recourse. And at least five guaranteed unrealistically exorbitant investment returns.\nHere are some other findings in the 14-page\u00a0report, entitled\u00a0Cryptocurrency Investment Promoters Are Mostly Frauds: Regulatory Report:\n\nSeven promoters offered securities tied to a\u00a0new\u00a0cryptocurrency.\nAt least five promoters all but ignored investing risks by guaranteeing returns, some as high as 40% per month.\nOnly 11 promoters provided potential investors with a physical address, leaving investors with little recourse if they lost their money.\nSix of the offerings involved payment of a commission to investors who recruited new investors into the scheme.\n\nThe investigation resulted in seven legal actions for fraud and illegal marketing.\u00a0Keep in mind that that\u2019s only for investigations conducted during a four-week period in the state of Texas. Extrapolate that over one year and to 49 other states in the United States alone.\nRegulators said crypto investment promoters are often misleading potential investors based on sham promises and shady info.\n\u201cThe investigations show\u00a0significant\u00a0risks in investing in securities that supposedly use cryptocurrencies to enrich investors,\u201d Securities Commissioner Travis J. Iles said.\nIles continued: \u201cThere is a lot of hype surrounding cryptocurrencies, but the companies offering investments are often not disclosing all the information investors need to make an informed decision. Investors risk giving their hard-earned money to anonymous promoters\u00a0hiding behind websites\u00a0who have\u00a0no intention of making good on their promises.\u201d\nPromoters Hype Bitcoin Price Spikes\nNot surprisingly,\u00a0the Texas State Securities Board found that most promoters hyped the incredible returns of bitcoin, whose price skyrocketed in 2017. They did that even when the products they marketed had nothing to do with bitcoin.\nThe Board also found that promoters routinely failed to disclose the huge risk of hacks. Cybertheft and hacks are all-too-common among even top cryptocurrency exchanges like Mt. Gox and Coincheck. In those instances, many customers lost their investments, and are still trying to get them back.\nThe securities board warned that benign profile photos on a company\u2019s website often hide the insidious nature of its dubious investment products.\nIn at least one instance, the Board discovered that a promoter had used a stock photo of a model and claimed that was one of its executives. In other instances, executives lied about their professional credentials.\n\u201cCharming portraits and lengthy profiles may convey a sense of comfort and security, but virtually anyone from anywhere may be lurking behind the flashy graphics,\u201d the report read.\nCelebrities Promoters: You Can Be Sued\nRegulatory scrutiny is heating up in the United States, India, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia as crypto slowly but surely seeps into the mainstream consciousness.\nAs CCN previously reported, securities attorneys are also warning celebrities who endorse initial coin offerings that they could be sued for promoting sham ICOs. Like prospective investors, celebrities should do their own due diligence before shilling a crypto product.\nDespite the scams in the unregulated cryptocurrency industry, Old Money is starting to pour into the space.

The report also suggests that 35% of counterfeit drugs sold globally come from India, underlining the significant problem at hand.\nAn anonymous NITI Aayog official told the publication:\nWe are all taking those [counterfeit] medicines and I am sure people are dying. One way to reduce that is put the entire supply chain on the blockchain.\nThe trial, the official claims, will see unique identification codes or numbers allocated for every single medicine which can then be tracked through the entire supply chain using blockchain technology. At every stage of the supply chain, the unique ID ensures the medicine is tracked immutably. Consumers will also be able to scan the QR code or a barcode on the medicine at the time of purchase on a smartphone app to verify the manufacturing source and the entire history of the supply chain process.\nWhen the medicine is sold, the unique code \u201cgets irrevocably audited on the blockchain\u201d to ensure that the same ID isn\u2019t duplicated to be used with spurious drugs, the official added.\nIndia\u2019s $28 billion pharmaceutical industry is supposedly throwing its support behind the trial, although there is some apprehension over costs.\n\u201cFake drugs are a concern and if blockchain can help the industry get rid of the problem we are up for it,\u201d DG Shah, secretary general of industry lobby Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance said of the trial. \u201cIf the government is willing to consider it that is an additional cost and compensate it, they industry will have no objection,\u201d he added.\nThe official also pointed to short-term concerns over implementing blockchain technology for the country\u2019s entire drug inventory. Additional barcoding will result in a production loss of 25% in the short term at least,\u201d Shah added, citing an inadequate packaging capacity.\nMeanwhile, another senior NITI official revealed the think tank has already identified a technology partner for the PoC trial. The body is currently on the lookout for a partner to implement and carry out the endeavor on a blockchain.\nAs reported previously, the NITI is already partaking in a number of blockchain PoC trials across a number of sectors including education, healthcare, and agriculture. The Indian government\u2019s numerous blockchain endeavors, both federally and in number of states, falls in line with mandate by India\u2019s prime minister who recently called for the \u201crapid adaptation\u201d of \u201cdisruptive technologies such as blockchain\u201d in society.", "category": "Blockchain News"}

The group will be adding Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and Silent Circle founder Phillip Zimmerman as an Executive Director/CSSO and major shareholder.\nPhillip Zimmerman is the creator of the first large-scale\u00a0public key cryptography system. Building on the base of the revolutionary RSA encryption algorithm, PGP was the first open protocol that allowed users to send encrypted messages back and forth using a public key. The protocol was widely adopted by early internet users and continues to be in use today.\nZimmerman\u2019s entrance into the cryptocurrency space is seen by some as a legitimizing force. While it\u2019s clear many cryptography experts like the universally disliked\u00a0Craig Wright have abused their industry prowess, Zimmerman is known as a more humble force in the industry. His most famous creation, PGP was invented as a way to bypass ISP surveillance for political organizations.\nAfter PGP\u2019s initial release, Zimmerman was investigated for violating the Arms Export Control Act\u00a0since cryptography is considered a form of munition. Here,\u00a0he became a champion for the free export of cryptography by exploiting a loophole in the definition of cryptography as \u201csoftware\u201d by printing the computer code in books which were then exported. After a 3 year investigation, the case was dropped. The liberalization of cryptography export laws resulting from the publicity around Zimmerman\u2019s case has been credited with making Bitcoin possible.\nWhat is Tiberius Coin?\nTiberius Coin is a coin linked to metals themselves rather than a fiat currency. The coin was created as a \u201cstabilizing force\u201d in an industry rife with volatility. The token itself is redeemable for physically deliverable metal meant to give it a price floor. Tiberius coin contains 3 different classes of metals\n\nTechnology Metals: metals essential to building computers and modern technology\n\nTin: 14%\nCopper: 23%\n\n\nElectric Vehicle: Metals needed to build electric cars and batteries\n\nCobalt: 10%\nAluminium: 7%\nNickel: 11%\n\n\nStability Metals: Precious metals proven to be stable over time to create a price floor\u00a0against Tariffs and trade wars.\n\nGold: 17%\nPalladium: 13%\nPlatinum: 6%\n\n\n\nWhile the tokenization of commodities itself is a relatively new concept, the underlying commodities are not. Diversified commodities funds have existed for hundreds of years and are the principal financial product of the Tiberius Group\u00a0which is the firm behind the coin. The group also brings with it some legitimacy having been around since 2005 and managing around $300 million. This differentiates it from some other crypto commodity plays such as GoldMint\u00a0and Digix\u00a0which performed very well during ICOs but had little to no financial services background.\nThe firm hopes that by 2020 it can replace tether as an asset-backed token. This is not entirely unfeasible given the cryptocurrency ecosystems inherent distrust of fiat currencies. What is unclear is whether or not this funds vision will be dampened by the idea of Bitcoin being the new gold. One thing is for sure, I\u2019m excited to see what else Zimmerman does in this space.", "category": "News"}

Bitcoin Core developer BTCDrak is involved with Halong Mining in some capacity, though it is unclear exactly how he is connected to the project.\nAt present, the DragonMint T1 is the most efficient miner on the market, surpassing even Bitmain\u2019s Antminer S9 in performance. In March, Slush Pool confirmed that someone in its mining pool had mined a block using Halong hardware, which achieves its superior efficiency through a technological upgrade called overt AsicBoost.\n\nOur block #514882 is the first-ever block mined using the active version-rolling aka overt AsicBoost.

Cobra has also refused to walk back these accusations now that the company has begun shipping miners to customers.\n\nHalong Mining is a scam. They sold re-badged Innosilicon BTC miners obtained through dubious means, and sold fake non-existent miners for other algorithms (customers *still* waiting for these to ship). They are huge scammers.\n\u2014 C\u00f8bra (@CobraBitcoin) April 6, 2018\n\nNevertheless, if Samsung is supplying chips to Halong, it could go a long way toward helping the upstart firm chip away at Bitmain\u2019s dominance in the ASIC market, as Samsung has the ability to scale up its ASIC chip production quite easily to accommodate consumer demand.", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

Gains from cryptocurrency-related investments and holding \u2018may be regarded as capital in nature\u2019 in certain scenarios while taxpayers are also entitled to claim expenses and deductions from cryptocurrency accruals or receipts.\nWhile SARS says it has fielded calls from the public to provide clarity on cryptocurrencies for taxation purposes, the tax agency insists that standard rules apply. \u201cThere is an existing tax framework that can guide SARS and affected taxpayers on the tax implications of cryptocurrencies, making a separate Interpretation Note unnecessary for now,\u201d the tax agency said.\nPointedly, it added:\nThe onus is on taxpayers to declare all cryptocurrency-related taxable income in the tax year in which it is received or accrued. Failure to do so could result in interest and penalties.\nFor miners, specifically, successfully mined coins will be deemed as \u2018trading stock\u2019 until it is sold or exchanged for cash, according to the notice.\nFurthermore, the tax agency clarified that it would not include a value-added tax (VAT) for cryptocurrency sales although the policy will come under review during the 2018 annual budget.", "category": "News"}

At present, it has 1,082 upvotes to just 46 downvotes on Github.\nHowever, in the meeting, Ethereum\u2019s core developers said that they were hesitant to adopt such a monumental and potentially chaotic change, particularly given that the cryptocurrency\u2019s long-term roadmap already includes a transition away from mining and to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.\nNoting that the advertised specifications for Bitmain\u2019s Antminer E3 \u2014 the first Ethash ASIC miner \u2014 represented an efficiency factor of approximately 250 percent over conventional GPU-based Ethereum mining, Vitalik Buterin said that the complexities involved with waging a war on ASICs are not currently justifiable.\n\u201cGetting everybody to upgrade is likely to be fairly chaotic and detract from more important things. So, at this point I personally lean quite significantly towards no action,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWorst case scenario is basically like that Bitmain controls a very large portion of the Ethereum network for some period of time,\u201d Buterin added. \u201cThis is not Bitcoin, right? Miners are not in control here. If there comes a day when they have majority hashpower and try to use it for evil, then it will basically just speed up Casper development.\u201d\nThe developers noted that they could still pursue action against the development of Ethash ASIC miners if the community demanded it, but it is too soon to tell whether the prevailing sentiment will shift now that several of the core developers have made their views clear.", "category": "Altcoin Mining"}

The plaintiff is also accusing Nano of not registering its XRB token with regulators as a security.\nThe lawsuit was filed on April 6 in the US District Court Eastern District of New York against the following defendants: Nano (formerly Raiblocks), Colin Lemahieu (creator and lead developer), Mica Busch (developer), Zach Shapiro (iOS developer) and Troy Retzer (public relations). The plaintiff, Alex Brola, is from Arizona. He originally invested $50,000, which had ballooned to more than $237,000 at the time of the hack.\u00a0Brola is being represented by The Braunstein Law Firm and Silver Miller.\nBack Story\nThe crux of the complaint surrounds not only the XRB hack but Nano\u2019s relationship with the exchange on which the security breach occurred, BitGrail. The complaint alleges that Nano promoted the security reliability of the BitGrail platform for trading XRB, and traders took their word. As you can see in the below exchange between an investor and Nano iOS developer Shapiro, while investors grew suspicious, the Nano team was none the wiser of what was truly going on behind closed doors at BitGrail.\nCourtesy: Silver Miller Law\n\u00a0\nThe plaintiffs allege that after leading investors to the Italian exchange to trade their digital coin and on the heels of the USD 170 million hack, Nano developers took no responsibility.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the XRB/BTC trading pair was the most widely used on BitGrail and reflected 80% of the exchange\u2019s total trading volume.\n\u201cDefendants suddenly sought to put more distance between themselves and BitGrail than even the Atlantic Ocean could provide,\u201d the complaint reads.\n\u00a0\nWhat Plaintiffs Want\nThe plaintiffs say the solution to the XRB problem \u201cresides squarely within defendants\u2019 hands.\u201d They point to what\u2019s known as a \u201crescue fork,\u201d involving the developers rewriting the XRB code \u201cto return stolen\u00a0assets,\u201d as per the complaint. Forking XRB would create new tokens that would then be distributed to the investors who lost funds in the heist.\nThe plaintiff alleges that the defendants don\u2019t want to do this because it wouldn\u2019t be in their best financial interest considering they own a large percentage (\u201cmillions if not tens of millions\u201d) of the XRB coin. As a result, the plaintiff is asking for a court-ordered fork of the XRB coin. Washington, DC-based attorney Stephen Palley tweeted \u2013\n\nMost interesting/novel part of this new class action involving Nano/XRB is the demand that the court order a \"rescue fork.\" First time I think, but will not be the last. pic.twitter.com/lWmfCokHo2\n\u2014 Palley (@stephendpalley) April 6, 2018\n\nIt\u2019s not the maiden fork-related lawsuit that\u2019s been filed, with US-based Coinbase being accused of sharing insider information tied to the support of Bitcoin Cash, bitcoin\u2019s 2017 hard fork.\nAccording to the lawsuit, there\u2019s a feud between Nano and BitGrail, BitGrail has suspended withdrawals from the XRB wallet.\nNano has been distancing themselves from BitGrail, saying they didn\u2019t believe the exchange had been on the up-and-up on their solvency all along. Nano executives said in a blog post: \u201cWe have no reason to believe the loss was due to an issue in the Nano protocol.

Telegram, a chat app with 200 million monthly users, is a commonly used platform for ICO teams and investors to interact with each other.\nThe company\u2019s new crypto project, Telegram Open Network, has raised a massive $1.7 billion in funding for its token sale so far and will offer services like file storage, private VPN and encrypted browsing platforms, services for decentralized apps and decentralized browsing, as well as micropayments and P2P payment capabilities.\nTelegram Open Network seems to have been created in an effort to divert funds away from the genuine project, and likely would have succeeded if the scam hadn\u2019t been exposed. Their legal registration as a company could have legitimized the project in the eyes of potential investors, but the project came to Telegram\u2019s attention recently, and a tweet on April 6 revealed that it was totally unconnected to the official project.\n\nThis entry is fake (https://t.co/vs6ZKJyiCG). Most likely a prank or scam, no such company was registered by Pavel.\n\u2014 Telegram Messenger (@telegram) April 6, 2018\n\nThe company claimed to have $1.13 billion in paid-up capital in their registration, something which raised suspicions \u2013 such a sum would have invited a massive tax bill under British law, which led British investors to question the authenticity of the project. Upon closer inspection, it was noted that Durov is listed as the director, founder, and secretary of the scam company, but the registration details describe his as a British citizen, whereas he is actually a citizen of St Kitts and Nevis after making a $250,000 donation to the sugar industry on the small island nation.\nApparently, the registration process for British companies is not as rigorous as might be expected \u2013 applicants are expected to verify their own details with no real oversight, and the process can be completed online for under $20 at Companies House. Despite the low barriers to entry, registration of a company can enable scammers to deceive victims who look only as far as the legal registration without investigating the fine details, a common occurrence in the fast-paced cryptocurrency investment space.\nTelegram\u2019s ICO made $850 million last week alone on top of $850 million raised privately in February according to documents lodged with the SEC. Many investors have already profited by flipping their tokens before the sale has even gone public. With demand for places in the huge ICO booming, it\u2019s not difficult to imagine how the fake company could have deceived real investors eager to participate in the action.", "category": "Bitcoin Scams"}
{"title": "Opinion: India\u2019s Cryptocurrency Crackdown Infringes on Fundamental Laws", "url": "https://www.ccn.com/reserve-bank-of-india-bans-crypto-nothing-to-worry/", "birthday": "2018-04-08T10:37:08+00:00", "date": "2018-04-08 10:37:08", "year": 2018, "month": 4, "day": 8, "content": "In this opinion piece,\u00a0Mohammed Danish, a lawyer practicing at the Delhi High Court in India, argues that the Indian central bank\u2019s recent directive to bar banking services to cryptocurrency exchanges is not sustainable by law. You can direct your queries to the Author at [email\u00a0protected].\nThe year 2018 does not seem to bestow a sigh of relief to the crypto community as a new press release by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has sparked off a tumultuous reaction which is driving the crypto-hopefuls in a tizzy. \nTime and again the RBI has been issuing cautionary to the crypto community about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks which the community is exposed to while dealing in cryptocurrency but despite operating under the dark clouds of such occasional cautionary by RBI, the sector continued to grow buoyed by the rising prices of cryptocurrencies. \nShedding the haze about the Government\u2019s stance in recognizing the potential of \u201cBlockchain\u201d technology and exploring its use for aiding digital economy, the Hon\u2019ble Finance Minister in his budget speech stated that cryptocurrency is not recognized as a legal tender, thus leaving a baffling ambiguity as to which way the camel will sit on the issue of legality of trading! Many in the crypto community welcomed the mention of \u201ccrypto\u201d in the speech and interpreted it to be a subtle nod for endorsing the crypto-trading, whereas others were apprehensive on the fate of the investments if the destiny turns out to be otherwise.\nSince the wrath of RBI has fallen now, the crypto community has stuck in another whirlpool of legal haphazard. The press release of RBI acknowledged the potential of Blockchain in improving the efficiency of the financial system, however, it simultaneously pointed out the risks involved with cryptocurrencies such as consumer protection, market integrity and money laundering. The RBI further informed that the entities regulated by it will be precluded from providing services to any individual or business entities dealing with cryptocurrencies. As a consequence of this, crypto investors will not be able to transfer money from their bank accounts to crypto trading wallets like Zebpay, Coinsecure, Unocoin etc.\nThe RBI has the power to issue directions to the banks under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, inter alia, in the public interest. In an earlier press release dated 24th December 2013, the RBI had enumerated various risks posed by the cryptocurrency entities to their users. If it is assumed that the RBI seeks to protect the general public from such risks then it has to indicate the relevant reasons which became ground for issuing such a draconian direction. \nThe RBI is considered to be a \u201cState\u201d under Article 12 of the Constitution and therefore RBI is prohibited under Article 13 to issue any direction/circular which takes away or abridges the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution and any direction so issued in contravention of Article 13 shall be void.\nThe said move taken by RBI is the direct infringement of the fundamental right to carry on trade guaranteed to the crypto exchanges in India under Article 19 (1) (g) of the constitution and therefore such direction has to pass the twofold test of legislative competence and constitutional validity. However, a reasonable restriction can be put in the interest of general public under Article 19 (6) but the RBI has to explain the mischief it seeks to check by putting such restriction. \nOn the contrary, the RBI has put a blanket restriction on the banks to deal with all the business entities. The direction of the RBI seeks to paint all the entities in the trade of crypto with the same brush, which cannot sustain the test of constitutional validity.\nIt is commonly believed that the challenges give rise to the opportunities for growth. At the present juncture, the crypto community is required to keep patience and wait for the law to take its own course as unlike other territories where the crypto is struggling for survival, India is a country which is governed by the rule of law. The unfolding events will certainly bring about the new avenues for the world of cryptocurrencies in India.", "category": "News"}

SBP warns that such schemes, which are similar to Ponzi schemes, this can cause significant losses to the general public.\nAlso read: India bans banks from processing cryptocurrency purchases\nReserve Bank Of India Clarifies Position\nLate on Friday, the Reserve Bank of India issued a more detailed circular stating any regulated entities that already provide virtual currency services are required to cut all ties within three months.\nSuch services include maintaining accounts, registering, trading, settling, clearing, giving loans against virtual tokens, accepting them as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges that deal with them and transfer funds in accounts relating to purchase or sale of virtual currencies.\nThe RBI acknowledged that blockchain technology has many potentially-beneficial applications but argues that cryptocurrencies raise a number of concerns related to consumer protection, market integrity, and preventing financial crimes.\nIndia-based cryptocurrency trading volume had already plummeted by 90 percent in recent months as banks themselves had already begun to restrict the ability of cryptocurrency exchanges to secure access to financial services and locals to trade with funds stored in Indian bank accounts. However, until now, this blockade had not been codified into official government policy.", "category": "Banking"}

This according to Elizabeth Stark, co-founder of Lightning Labs in a conversation with Yahoo Finance The Final Round.\nIn a turn of events, cryptocurrencies have begun to steal the show again away from blockchain. It\u2019s a far cry from the San Francisco startup\u2019s earlier days when Lightning decided to remove \u201cbitcoin\u201d from its marketing resources because at the time blockchain was king.\n\u201cNow, I feel like we\u2019ve entered into a \u2018bitcoin, not blockchain\u2019 world, where people understand the value of cryptocurrency technology and what these can bring,\u201d said Stark to Yahoo, pointing to proof-of-work and public/private key cryptography that \u201cmake bitcoin special.\u201d\nStark reflected on the rise of blockchain before seemingly at the cost of bitcoin, the latter of which had become taboo in financial services. Lightning at the time was developing bitcoin software, and Stark and other developers knew that the banking industry\u2019s decision to shun bitcoin was misinformed.\nOther blockchain\u00a0veterans have previously pointed out that \u201cblockchain doesn\u2019t exist without bitcoin\u201d because of the miner-fueled network.\nStark and Lightning were vindicated with the rise in the market capitalization not only of bitcoin but all the leading cryptocurrencies at year-end 2017. While the prices have since pulled back, that\u2019s actually not such a bad thing when you\u2019re a developer in the bitcoin space. \u201cBig price spikes aren\u2019t good for us technical folks that are developing,\u201d said Stark, adding she \u201cwants things to be calm.\u201d\nLightning Network\nLightning is behind the Lightning Network software, which is in beta format. It sits atop Bitcoin to deliver faster transactions and more of them. Lightning Network can also be accessed via mobile.\nYou hear a lot about the use cases for bitcoin being a store of value and for payments, the latter of which has been problematic amid lengthy and costly transactions. But the Lightning Network looks to solve that by facilitating transactions off the blockchain between the buyer and seller instead of relying on the volunteers to verify each transaction. But it\u2019s still close enough to the blockchain if it\u2019s needed. It\u00a0opens the door to more possibilities for bitcoin and micropayments, as the Yahoo panel suggested.\nStark provided a glimpse into the roadmap for the Lightning Network, including \u201cmany thousands of transactions per second and maybe someday even millions per second,\u201d which dwarfs the capabilities of Visa.\u00a0No wonder Visa executives feel threatened\u00a0by bitcoin.\u00a0Especially considering it remains early innings for bitcoin.\n\u201cBitcoin is a marathon, not a sprint.

While admitting that cryptocurrencies do not directly fall under its regulatory scope, the FCA stressed that certain models of their usage bring them under its purview in a \u2018complex\u2019 landscape.\nPointedly, the FCA confirmed it would reveal its own take on cryptocurrencies, policy-wise, later this year. The regulator said:\nWe will work with the Bank of England and the Treasury as part of a taskforce to develop thinking and publish a Discussion Paper later this year outlining our policy thinking on cryptocurrencies.\nThe FCA is notably a member of the \u2018Cryptoassets Task Force\u2019 established by the British government in March 2018, consisting of the regulator, Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury and the Bank of England (the central bank).

Over the past 24 hours, the bitcoin price has rebounded from the $6,500 level once again, rising back to $7,100.\n\nBitcoin Trend\nFor short-term recovery, the $7,700 to $7,800 range still remain as an important level for bitcoin that could allow the most dominant cryptocurrency in the market to potentially eye a move towards the $8,000 region. Previously, when the bitcoin price surged to $7,500, traders were anticipating it to break the $7,800 support level. But, it could hold its momentum and continue its corrective rally.\nIn the next few days, the $7,800 mark will be an important level to observe, and if the bitcoin price can surpass beyond that point, it is possible that the cryptocurrency initiates a strong short-term recovery and ends April with large gains.\nAt the moment, the cryptocurrency market in general still lacks volumes across the board, on both major and minor cryptocurrencies. During the recent 70 percent correction, the vast majority of weak hands and speculators left the market, and new capital or money has to come into the market to increase the liquidity of major cryptocurrencies.\nThe trading volume has to increase first, and the transaction volume of bitcoin will increase, and then as user activity surges, the bitcoin price will follow. Currently, the market is seeing an increase in trading volume, and if the entrance of large-scale institutional investors like the Rockefeller family, Rothschild family, and George Soros could lead to a substantial increase in liquidity, the cryptocurrency market could rebound strong within April.\nThis week, it was revealed that following the $8 billionaire trader George Soros, the Rockefeller family and its venture capital firm Venrock are investing in both cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups for long-term returns. David Pakman, a general partner at Venrock, which stands for Venture and Rockefeller, stated:\n\u201cWe wanted to partner with this team that has been making investments and actually helping to architect a number of different crypto economies and crypto token-based projects. There are a lot of crypto traders in the market. There are a lot of cryptocurrency hedge funds. This is different. In fact, to us, it looks a little bit more like venture capital,\u201d Pakman said.\nAltcoin Season\nThe season of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoin) is not back yet. But, a handful of altcoins have been outperforming bitcoin over the past week, which was not the case throughout January to March. Cryptocurrencies like 0x, NEO, Ontology, and Dragonchain have recorded 5 to 40 percent gains against bitcoin over the past week.\nOver the past month, investors remained skeptical toward Ethereum and the token ecosystem due to the imposition of strict policies by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other governments like South Korea. But, as Japan started to legalize ICOs, South Korea began a process to allow domestic ICOs once again, and major exchanges such as Coinbase applied to the SEC to operate as registered ICO trading platforms, the demand for ICOs and Ethereum have started to rise again.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Joining the FSC is the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a watchdog with the mandate to prevent money laundering and illegal financial flows.\nNongHyup Bank, in particular, is notable for servicing Coinone and Bithumb, two of South Korea\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges.\nAs reported previously, South Korean regulators moved to ban anonymous cryptocurrency trading through anonymous virtual bank accounts offered by domestic banks. The move saw at least six banks issuing new trading accounts for cryptocurrency transactions with new measures that mandates a matching real name between the trader\u2019s bank account and the crypto-exchange account. On January 30, the ban on anonymous trading kicked in and multiple banks began to offer accounts that complied with the new KYC-mandate.\nWith its inspection, the FSC and the FIU said they would focus on a number of details including checks on the number of trading accounts syncing with the exchanges and their respective deposits, their trading volume and more alongside checking for AML adherence.\nThe FIU also moved to urge other financial institutions to conduct their own inspections and audits to ensure compliance to new rules.\nWhile anonymous trading accounts switch over to real-name accounts in the country, Korea\u2019s government is also drawing up a cryptocurrency taxation framework that is expected to be made public come June this year.

It is required to publicly release its earnings and given that its only subsidiary company is Bithumb, the revenue and profit margins of BTCKorea are automatically that of Bithumb.\nAccording to Coindesk Korea, Bithumb has increased its revenue by 171-fold in 2017, in comparison to its revenue in 2016. Bithumb takes 0.15 percent of every order as its operating fee, and the fee model remains as the main revenue stream of the cryptocurrency exchange.\nIn 2017, especially in its fourth quarter, the trading volume of South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges rose exponentially, as the demand for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum skyrocketed. Leading cryptocurrency trading platforms were sold at high valuations and the stock prices of publicly listed cryptocurrency exchanges surged. Korbit, the third biggest cryptocurrency trading platform in South Korea, was acquired for $150 million.\n\nIn 2017, Bithumb recorded a net income or profit of $420 million but recorded a revenue of 330 million. Investors in the public market were taken aback by the absurd numbers relayed by Bithumb, given that its net income was higher than its revenue, which is not possible in most cases unless the company makes substantial income outside of its main revenue model.\nDuring an interview with Coindesk Korea, Bithumb representative stated that the company has made a profit of $90 million outside of its main business model and its cryptocurrency trading platform as non-operating income. Bithumb hinted that this may have been generated from office rental, interest rates, and investment gains.\n\u201cThe details of Bithumb\u2019s balance sheet will only be finalized on March 30, in a board meeting. As such, it is difficult to confirm any details of the company\u2019s balance sheet in early April. Bithumb will likely introduce details of its earnings in late April,\u201d said Bithumb.\nOften, non-operating income comes from companies with properties that are being rented out to other individuals or businesses. For example, if Bithumb has a commercial building in the heart of Seoul it rents out to other businesses as it only uses a part of it, it can count as the company\u2019s non-operating income. Hence, it is not included in the revenue of the company, but in its net income.\nIt is likely that Bithumb generated its non-operating income from its direct cryptocurrency investments, as it is possible that the company held funds in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum.\nA similar situation occurred with Yahoo a few years ago, when they held a big chunk of Alibaba shares. As the price of Alibaba stock surged, Yahoo\u2019s non-operating income increased as well, boosting the company\u2019s balance sheet.\nLoss\nIf the non-operating income of Bithumb came from its bitcoin investment, which is most likely the case, Bithumb will see a loss in 2018, if bitcoin fails to recovery beyond the $19,000 mark. The 2017 earnings of Bithumb included bitcoin\u2019s price spike to $19,000, which hit $24,000 in South Korea due to local premiums.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

Consequently, fundamental changes to a PoW algorithm can \u201cbrick\u201d them permanently.\nWhile the devices are still compatible with other Cryptonight coins, there is little consumer demand to mine an algorithm headlined by Electroneum, Bytecoin, and Sumokoin.\nConsequently, Bitmain and Baikal are sitting on piles of now nearly-worthless devices, and while Bitmain can likely stomach the losses due to its reported $4 billion in profits last year, Baikal may have bitten off more than it can chew.\nTo wit, the Hong Kong-based firm is now offering a five-for-one deal on its Cryptonight ASICs in a bid to recoup something \u2014 anything \u2014 from the funds it poured into researching, development, and manufacturing for the nascent product.\n\nBuy one, get Five. pic.twitter.com/YYkkEOb9fH\n\u2014 Baikalminer (@baikalminer) April 9, 2018\n\nMeanwhile, at least five different projects claim that they will continue to develop the old Monero blockchain, including two named \u201cMonero Classic\u201d and one that has been promoted by Bitmain\u2019s official Twitter account.\nMonero is not the only major cryptocurrency that has considered using a hard fork to maintain ASIC resistance. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, recently began this debate in response to Bitmain\u2019s announcement that it had developed an Ethash ASIC miner. While the fork appears wildly popular among users, developers have thus far been hesitant to pursue the potentially \u201cchaotic\u201d course.", "category": "Altcoin Mining"}

The rash decision of the bank could become a major mistake for Pakistan\u2019s economy moving forward.\nMistake\nThroughout 2018, many of the major economies internationally including South Korea, Japan, and the US have embraced the cryptocurrency market. The three countries have imposed practical regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges and investors, and Japan has already introduced its intention to legalize initial coin offerings (ICOs).\nThe South Korean government and the Financial Services Commission (FSC) released its plans to legalize domestic ICOs once again, as soon as taxation policies for token sales are drafted and passed by the government. While the US and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are cracking down on unregulated iCOs, the SEC clearly stated that it is open to regulating private iCOs if it goes through the agency. So far, the SEC has stated that not a single ICO has applied to the SEC.\nEarlier this year, Kakao, South Korea\u2019s largest internet conglomerate which manages KakaoTalk, KakaoPay, KakaoTaxi, KakaoStory, and other massively popular applications in the country, teased its plan to launch a blockchain venture and an ICO outside of the country, due to the strict policies of South Korea. Consequently, the South Korean government stated that it may allow domestic ICOs, if they are approved by local financial authorities.\nWhile major economies are scrambling to regulate the cryptocurrency market, small economies like Pakistan and Vietnam have completely shut out the cryptocurrency market, rejecting users, investors, and businesses, and possibly billions of dollars. \nOn April 6, the State Bank of Pakistan announced that local financial institutions, banks, and credit card service providers are not allowed to be involved in the cryptocurrency market in any way, and are not allowed to process cryptocurrency transactions, promote, and invest in the cryptocurrency market. It completely dismissed its local cryptocurrency market.\nIn hindsight, Pakistan\u2019s ban on cryptocurrencies has virtually no impact on the global cryptocurrency market, given that the Pakistan cryptocurrency market does not even account for 0.1 percent of the global cryptocurrency market. But, Pakistan has made an error in dismissing overseas blockchain companies that could potentially expand into or relocate to countries like Pakistan for cheaper resources.\nCase of Malta\nMalta has taken the opportunity to appeal to the blockchain sector and companies within it. This week, Changpeng Zhao, the CEO at the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, stated that 20 large market cap companies, mostly billion-dollar companies, are planning to move to Malta, following the roadmap of Binance.\n\nIn the last 2 weeks, I am aware of 20+ large cap crypto projects confirm establishing/moving/investing in Malta.

Traders were anticipating the $6,500 resistance level closely, as breaking that mark could have led the price of bitcoin to near the $6,000 mark. \nThe bitcoin price recorded a bounce at $6,610, rising by more than $100 and leaving the opportunity to recover back to the $8,000 region within April open.\nFundamentally, bitcoin remains strong, with increasing adoption in regions like the US, Japan, and South Korea. Institutional investors, who have not been interested in the cryptocurrency market throughout the entirety of 2017, have started to enter the cryptocurrency sector. \nThis week, it was revealed that $8 billionaire George Soros and his fund, Rockefeller family and its venture capital firm Venrock, and the Rothschild family have started to invest in the cryptocurrency sector. In an interview with Fortune, Venrock partner David Pakman stated that the family is interested in investing in the cryptocurrency space for long-term profits, not short-term gains.\n\u201cWe wanted to partner with this team that has been making investments and actually helping to architect a number of different crypto economies and crypto token-based projects. There are a lot of crypto traders in the market. There are a lot of cryptocurrency hedge funds. This is different. In fact, to us, it looks a little bit more like venture capital,\u201d said Pakman.\nAnalysts and media outlets in the traditional finance sector have attempted to justify the recent price movement of bitcoin with irrelevant news such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch describing bitcoin as a bubble. However, bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market are not dependent on these events as much as they were in its early phase in 2013.\nFour years ago, the comment of JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on bitcoin led the price of the digital currency to fall by a significant margin. Since then, every imaginable financial institution and analyst have condemned bitcoin, and such statements no longer affect the price of bitcoin negatively.\nMarket Supply and Demand\nThe cryptocurrency exchange market is more liquid than most regional stock markets, and the market moves by supply and demand. Currently, the volumes on most major cryptocurrency exchanges are low, and the low volume is the primary reason behind the current bear cycle of the cryptocurrency market.\nOnce volumes begin to pick up as the over-the-counter (OTC) market continues to prosper, the price of cryptocurrencies will be able to recover.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

According to The Wall Street Journal, Coinbase reached out to regulators about the getting licensed even as the SEC moves closer to crafting some regulatory framework by which exchanges and other market players would operate.\nBitcoin exchanges have been feeling increased pressure from the Wall Street regulator of late, as evidenced by the SEC launching an investigation into ICOs and putting exchanges on notice that they were on the radar, too. While SEC Chairman Jay Clayton recently stated that not all ICOs are fraudulent, the regulatory agency has also made it clear that security tokens must be traded on licensed exchanges.\nAccording to the WSJ story, Coinbase may look to become licensed by the SEC as an exchange but at the same time register as a broker-dealer, the latter of which face less stringent rules. But it would also mean the securities regulator would have carte blanche access to buy and sell transaction records.\nLicensing Opens the Door to More Altcoins\nAt the moment, Coinbase only supports bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Litecoin.\nCourtesy: Coinbase\nBecoming licensed\u00a0could potentially open the door to the exchange supporting more altcoins, including those that US regulators deem securities, the WSJ story suggests. It could also explain why Coinbase has been reluctant to add more coins, such as Ripple\u2019s XRP, till now. As CCN previously reported, Ripple was willing to pay for a listing on top cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.\nCoinbase\u2019s President Asiff\u00a0Hirji told CNBC a few days ago:\n\u201cWe are on the right side of where the regualtions are,\u201d said Hirji on CNBC, adding: \u201cYou cannot then list things for which there are regul uncertainty because that dosen\u2019t fit with our mission.

However, a sense of relief was embedded in all the cautions for the investors that, if at all, the hammer of Government will only fall on the miscreants who will flout the law of the land.\nMinistry of Finance had also constituted an inter-disciplinary committee was also appointed to examine the regulatory framework with regard to Virtual Currencies. The committee was comprised of representatives from different Government departments inter alia, stock exchange board of India and Reserve Bank of India. The act of appointing an expert committee also indicated that the Government is willing to rein in the cryptocurrencies in the best interest of all the participants.\nIn the mid of 2017, an unprecedented surge was seen in the advent of ICO\u2019s and new crypto exchanges and the price of the bitcoin had ascended the ladder of an unusual value (above $21,000.00). As a result of an increase in price and huge profits earned by the investors caused the bitcoin to become the topic of every tongue. With the increased popularity of bitcoin, fraud and crimes involving the same also increased and then began the era of knocking the doors of Supreme Court by Public Spirited persons.\nThe first Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was brought before the Supreme Court by Mr. Vijay Pal Dalmia Advocate, by way of Writ Petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution seeking a\u00a0ban on sale and purchase of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, litecoin etc in India. The said Writ was ordered by Apex Court to be treated as a representation and Reserve Bank of India was directed to examine the same and communicate its decision on the representation within a specified time. However, the RBI instead of clarifying its stance on the issue evasively responded while giving information about the appointment of Inter-Disciplinary Committee by the Ministry of Finance.\nThereafter, the same Petitioner filed another PIL seeking that cryptocurrencies and all the platforms including mobile applications, websites etc. sued for sale and purchase of crypto, be declared as illegal. Just after this, another PIL was filed in which the difficulties faced by the investors were agitated and it was prayed to the Apex Court that the Crypto should either be regulated by a legal framework or it should be completely banned.\nThe aforesaid PILs are pending adjudication before the Supreme Court since November 2017 and surprisingly the Government has not disclosed its stance before the Supreme Court whether it is in favor or against the Crypto ecosystem.\nIn a recent development, the\u00a0Internet and Mobile Association of India has also filed an impleadment application in the ongoing litigation praying that since the outcome of the decision of Supreme Court will have a bearing on its interest, therefore, it should also be allowed to advance its stance in the issue. There is strong likelihood that the new RBI notification severing fiat-crypto ties will be challenged in the Court of Law. So now the parties with competing interests are face-to-face before the Supreme Court, a gavel stroke of which will decide the future of cryptocurrencies in India.\nThe atmosphere on the social media indicates that the Crypto community is hopeful of a respite from the Supreme Court.

This process basically splits Bitcoin into two separate coins: Bitcoin (\u201cBTC\u201d) and Bitcoin Cash (\u201cBCH\u201d). When this occurred, everyone who held Bitcoin in a compatible wallet or exchange became entitled to claim an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, a BCH coin would cost you around $700. Anyone who received the coin for free because they held BTC at the time of the fork is celebrating the coin\u2019s success. Many investors may not even know that they are entitled to claim the coin since doing so often requires specific technical expertise. However, BCH can be claimed by any eligible investor at any time.\n\nThe success of Bitcoin Cash has been a windfall to many Bitcoin investors. Now that tax season is upon us; these investors must be sure to properly report their Bitcoin Cash to the IRS. In fact, Bitcoin holders need to understand how to report the receipt of any new currencies they receive as a result of recent and upcoming Bitcoin forks. This is true even for forked coins that you have not yet redeemed.\n\nA common question: Many people claim that you have to report the Bitcoin Cash as income at the time of receipt. But does that really understand the process by which it is generated and is there a better analogy in the IRS codes?\nWhen the software that supports a coin forks, the resources that supported the coin ecosystem also fork. Since they can no longer solve Bitcoin transaction problems and update ledgers, a new coin comes into existence. To encourage acceptance and recognize the resources that are pulled from the old coin to the new coin, a deposit is made available for anyone holding Bitcoin (or other coins that fork) of the new coin.\n\nA better analogy is that of a stock spin-off. Resources that formerly supported Bitcoin are now split to support Bitcoin Cash. Very similar to what happens when a company splits off a portion of their assets into a new company. You get stock in the new company in proportion to the stock you held in the old company. Typically the cost basis is allocated between the old and new stock. When the stock is sold a gain or loss is recognized.\n\nEstablishing the cost basis of the new coin can be difficult. Since we know the total cost basis of the new and old coin cannot exceed 100%, we have two choices to make.\n\nEstablish a complex formula to determine cost basis that varies with the time of receipt (since not everyone got the coin at the same time) and making it nearly impossible to track the cost basis of the original coin\u2026. Or\nUse the conservative approach of leaving 100% of the cost basis with the original coin and using a zero cost basis for the new coin. This method is the preferred one.\nWith many forks on the horizon for 2018, this can get complicated quickly. If you hold Bitcoin, be sure to consult with a tax professional to make sure you understand how, what, and when you need to disclose information about forked coins to the IRS.\n\nEven if you haven\u2019t claimed a forked coin you\u2019re entitled to; a virtual currency split may be a taxable event in itself. Bitcoin investors can count on Happy Tax for the tax planning and preparation services they need to keep the IRS off their backs. The trained cryptocurrency accountants at Happy Tax can help you understand how forked coins fit into your larger portfolio.

Archive Poster, a popular Chrome extension supposedly designed for managing Tumblr posts, was discovered to be mining Monero from hundreds of thousands of different devices in secret and without permission, a malicious activity now known as \u201ccryptojacking\u201d. An Android app was caught cryptojacking millions of devices in January, also mining Monero.\nWhile Google had already banned malicious cryptojacking apps, the recent ban takes things a step further with a blanket ban that removes all extensions designed for mining, even those openly designed for that purpose. Google released a statement yesterday outlining the reasons behind the ban, saying \u201c90% of all extensions with mining scripts that developers have attempted to upload to Chrome Web Store have failed to comply\u201d with their new mining policies, recently implemented to deter malicious mining extensions. As of yesterday, no new cryptomining extensions are being accepted, and existing extensions will all be delisted by late June. Google clarified that blockchain extensions with non-mining functions were still welcome and under no threat at this time.\nCryptomining extensions were arguably popularised by torrent site The Pirate Bay, which began harnessing user\u2019s CPU power last year in an attempt to monetize the site. Since then, bad actors have attempted to capitalize on the trend through malicious apps and extensions that are now making it difficult for legitimate versions to survive.\nCasual users weren\u2019t the only ones to fall prey to covert cryptomining operations recently \u2013 a Russian nuclear facility was allegedly compromised by its own staff when one of Russia\u2019s most powerful supercomputers was discovered to have covert cryptomining software installed and operating. The nuclear supercomputer is supposed to remain offline at all times for security purposes, and the breach was apparently discovered when the scientists allegedly attempted to connect the computer to the Internet,\nTesla fell prey to a\u00a0cryptojacking\u00a0incident recently along with government websites throughout the US, UK and Australia \u2013 even Google\u2019s own DoubleClick Ad service was used to illegally distribute mining software to unsuspecting users. While many casual internet users would reportedly be glad to sacrifice some CPU power in exchange for ad-free browsing, the ban will force at least 200 million Chrome users to look elsewhere.\nThe decision comes in quick succession after Google\u2019s decision to ban ICO advertisements starting from June, with Twitter and Snapchat following suit.", "category": "Companies"}

A group of Zurich-based researchers developed a bubble/crash report, predicting that bitcoin\u2019s market value, which currently hovers at about USD 124 billion, will be slashed by approximately 37% to no greater than USD 77 billion by year-end 2018. It\u2019s all based on a theory known as Metcalfe\u2019s law.\nThe findings may appear to chart the course for a bitcoin price that\u2019s been under pressure year-to-date amid regulatory pushback from major bitcoin markets around the world. But by the same token, the bitcoin fog may be nothing that greater regulatory clarity could clear up. After all, the markets don\u2019t like uncertainty.\nSo what is Metcalfe\u2019s law, you may be wondering? It\u2019s a theory introduced by Ethernet founder Bob Metcalfe from the 1980s stating \u201cthe value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of nodes,\u201d also known as the \u201cnetwork effect.\u201d While stocks rely on fundamentals such as P/E ratios, the Swiss researchers believe that \u201cif Metcalfe\u2019s law holds here,\u201d valuing bitcoin could be easy.\nETH Zurich\u2019s Findings\nThe researchers were led by\u00a0Spencer Wheatley, a professor of entrepreneurial risk at ETH Zurich. They concluded the number of bitcoin users doesn\u2019t support a rise in bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\u201cOur Metcalfe-based analysis indicates current support levels for the bitcoin market in the range of 22\u201344 billion USD, at least four times less than the current level,\u201d the researchers said.\nIf they\u2019re right, bitcoin\u2019s market value will not continue to climb higher as it did in 2017.\u00a0Worse, the researchers say that considering the \u201cclose correlation\u201d between the BTC price and that of altcoins, \u201cthe short-term movements of\u00a0other cryptocurrencies are likely to be affected by corrections in bitcoin (and vice-versa), regardless of\u00a0their own relative valuations.\u201d\nDoom and Gloom?\nBitcoin could be in for \u201cmany months of volatile sideways bitcoin prices ahead,\u201d according to the March report, which also \u201cidentifies a substantial but not unprecedented overvaluation in the price of bitcoin.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not unprecedented because their research also documents four such \u201cbubbles in market cap,\u201d all of which eventually burst. Three out of the four previous bubbles burst in response to fundamental issues, such as the collapse of Japan\u2019s Mt. Gox exchange on the heels of a catastrophic security breach.

Baldet was the architect of JPMorgan\u2019s blockchain strategy, having sat at the helm of the bank\u2019s Blockchain Center of Excellence. She is reportedly leaving to launch her own firm on the heels of reports suggesting that JPMorgan may be spinning off its enterprise blockchain project dubbed Quorum, which Baldet was basically the face of.\nThe latest executive shakeup suggests there could be more defections to come at the bank, whose CEO Jamie Dimon infamously rebuffed bitcoin last year (but later backpedaled.)\nJPMorgan didn\u2019t waste any time in naming Baldet\u2019s successor. According to an internal JPMorgan memo obtained by Reuters, she will be replaced by fellow Blockchain Center of Excellence official and senior product manager Christine Moy, who incidentally was hired by Baldet, according to Fortune.\nThe memo said Baldet was leaving for an \u201centrepreneurial opportunity\u201d but didn\u2019t say whether it was blockchain related. It was penned by Umar Farooq, who earlier this year boasted about the inroads JPMorgan\u2019s blockchain business was making.\nBaldet\u2019s departure appears to be on good terms, with JPMorgan spokesperson telling Reuters: \u201cWe respect her desire to start her own venture and we wish her nothing but the best.\u201d\nQuorum Spinoff More Likely Than Ever\nCCN previously reported that JPMorgan was considering the spinoff of Quorum, saying then it was unclear what the impact of such a move would have on staff. It also presciently suggested Baldet\u2019s future was uncertain. The latest executive departure suggests that the bank is headed in the direction of separating Quorum from the bank.\nJPMorgan considers Quorum the \u201centerprise-focused version of Ethereum.\u201d It\u2019s for the clearing and settling of interbank payments, something financial institutions are increasingly looking to the blockchain for.\nUnlike the public ledger that fuels bitcoin, Quorum is a private ledger that bolsters transaction times and whose validation is dependent on participants in the contract, not volunteers. It\u2019s been in development for the past couple of years, and spinning it off would create more possibilities for the technology, even beyond banking.\nQuorum competes with the likes of R3\u2019s Corda, whose bank-fueled consortium JPMorgan was part of until recently. R3\u2019s CTO Richard Brown said in a December blog post that since JPMorgan\u2019s Quorum is basically a fork of Ethereum, it inherited both the advantages and disadvantages of the second biggest blockchain network.

Medici has roughly a dozen portfolio companies, including Factom, Ripio, and tZero \u2014 which is in the middle of an initial coin offering (ICO) that Overstock expects will raise $250 million.\nDue to its involvement in the blockchain space, Overstock has been characterized by some analysts as a \u201cproxy stock\u201d for cryptocurrencies.

CEO Patrick Byrne has stated that the firm was not issued a subpoena \u2013 as many ICO operators were \u2013 but has been submitting documents voluntarily. He has also maintained that tZero\u2019s offering complies with federal securities laws.\nThe second trigger was the secondary stock offering, through which Overstock had planned to issue four million new shares. The company\u2019s share price fell by 10 percent on the news since the offering would have diluted the value of the currently-existent 29 million shares.", "category": "Bitcoin & Blockchain Investments"}

Worldwide, the organization includes thirty-two representative offices.\nAccording to the chair of the GNTB, Petra Hedorfer, recent trends in technologies are constantly under review, as well as their application for the organization. Striving to be an innovative global company, driving the tourism industry, the choice was made to implement blockchain and cryptocurrencies as part of the Board\u2019s digitization strategy.\nProviding speed and additional security for transactions, the acceptance of cryptocurrencies (on their respective blockchains) may offer financial savings for international transactions, in addition to the transparency thereof.\nFollowing the 500-year mark of the Reformation (recognized in 2017), upcoming events in Germany include the European Athletics Championships in Berlin this August, 100 years of the Bauhaus in 2019, and, in 2020, a 250th birthday of Ludwig van Beethoven.\nHow and Where Cryptocurrencies May Be Used in German Travel\nHistory abounds throughout Germany, and Europe as a whole, making travel an education; paying for the experiences with recent advances in fintech is the (proverbial) cherry on top.\nThe Bavarian Neuschwanstein Castle is a fairytale in the making, begun in 1886, and not yet perfected by the time of King Ludwig II\u2019s death in 1886. Greatly inspired by the music and characters of Richard Wagner\u2019s operas, the castle was build as a private sanctuary from the public eye.

Individual victims, according to the agency, often see losses \u201cin the thousands of dollars.\u201d\nThe FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) sounded the alarm through a notice that warns users tech support fraud continues to be a \u201cproblematic and widespread scam.\u201d In the notice, the agency reveals the IC3 received approximately 11,000 complaints related to tech support fraud in 2017.\nVictims claimed to have lost nearly $15 million, which according to the notice represents an 86 percent increase in losses when compared to 2016. The majority of victims are located in the United States, although the agency notes it received complaints from victims in 85 different countries.\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies, the IC3 notes that criminals usually pose as cryptocurrency exchange support staff and ask for access to victims\u2019 devices, as with most tech support scams. Once the victim gives them access, they go on with their scheme:\n\u201cThe fraudulent support asks for access to the victim\u2019s virtual currency wallet and transfers the victim\u2019s virtual currency to another wallet for temporary holding during maintenance. The virtual currency is never returned to the victim, and the criminal ceases all communication.\u201d\nMoreover, the agency added that scammers may also use their victims\u2019 personal information and credit cards to purchase cryptocurrencies they will then send to wallets they control. Often, victims end up being tricked after contacting fake support numbers online in the \u201csponsored\u201d section of search results.\nKeeping funds safe\nIn order to avoid falling for cryptocurrency tech support scams, the agency advises users to be as careful as possible in dealing with contacts listed in the \u201csponsored\u201d areas of search results, as these are likely boosted ads.\nMoreover, victims are instructed to not give strangers access to their devices, ensure their software is updated, and resist the urge to act quickly if they\u2019re confronted with someone trying to create a sense of urgency. Legitimate customer support teams, the agency noted, don\u2019t initiate unsolicited contacts.\nIf dealing with a pop-up or a type of malware that locks victim\u2019s screens, they are\u00a0\u00a0advised to immediately shut down their devices, as \u201cvictims who reported shutting down their device and waiting a short time to restart usually find the pop-up or screen lock has disappeared.\u201d\nWhen cryptocurrency users resist\nCrypto enthusiasts are often tech-savvy and are now somewhat accustomed to scammers trying to get their funds. Scammers have been using phishing and social engineering tactics to get paid, and even managed to hijack verified Twitter accounts to try and trick users.\nRecently, a bitcoiner had to face a scammer asking him for 0.15 BTC. He managed to persuade the scammer into dressing up as a raccoon, and had him forage through dumpsters in his neighborhood to get the funds. In the end, he wasn\u2019t given anything.\nThese events show scammers are willing to go to great lengths to get paid.

Ethereum, Ripple, and Bitcoin Cash all declined by more than 12 percent, as the market lost over $40 billion within a two-day span.\nBoth bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market have not seen these levels since early February, when the price of bitcoin dipped to $6,000.

Volumes on most exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex, Bithumb, Bitflyer, and Upbit remain relatively low, but the volumes on futures markets are intensifying, as CCN previously reported.\nSeveral analysts including Wall Street-based Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee have stated that bitcoin is still on track to end the year at $20,000, especially if the market can initiate a mid-term recovery within the upcoming months. \nAbra CEO Bill Barhydt stated that while the demand towards the cryptocurrency market has been non-existent from institutional investors and retailer traders in the west, that certainly has not been the case in Asia.\n\u201cThere really is zero large-scale institutional money from the west in crypto right now.

However, amendments were requested by Ministry of Economic Development,\u00a0Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Justice, Central Bank of Russia and others to soften the rules for cryptocurrency users.

Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and other major cryptocurrencies have also recorded a daily increase in value.\nBear Cycle\nThe cryptocurrency market is going through a bear cycle, and speculators who previously sought for 10 to 100-fold returns within a three to six-month period have left the market. In countries like South Korea, celebrities who were actively trading bitcoin a few months ago have offered public apology, distorting the image of bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nSpeculators tend to over exaggerate their response when the market goes up or down, out of FOMO (fear of missing out) or panic, which is one of the primary reasons why the cryptocurrency market tends to see extreme volatility on both upside and downward movements.\nOver the past three months, since the correction has begun in January, the downward movement in the cryptocurrency market has been exaggerated. Massive sell volumes were demonstrated and the market recorded a correction of around 72 percent. The recent correction has been the third worst correction in the history of the market. \nBut, the exact same trend was seen many times before, and each time the market had corrected itself, it recovered. In 2014, that recovery period took around a year. During this correction, after reaching its bottom at exactly $6,000, bitcoin price has been volatile in the $7,000 to $8,000 range, sometimes dipping below $7,000 and moving above $8,000.\nEvidently, investors have been uncertain about the short-term trend of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In a period like this, fundamentals are important and cryptocurrency adoption is particularly crucial. \nIn South Korea and Japan, despite the negative image of bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market, the adoption rate of digital currencies is on the rise. Japan\u2019s largest electronics retailer Bic Camera has been accepting bitcoin for many months, the country\u2019s largest budget airline and hotel chain Capsule are integrating bitcoin, and South Korea\u2019s third biggest e-commerce platform is integrating 12 cryptocurrencies.\nBased on transaction volume, trading volume, and search engine interests, the cryptocurrency market is undoubtedly experiencing a bear cycle, and it could take a few months before major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin can recover to its previous levels.\nStability Needed\nStill, several analysts remain positive on the mid-term trend of bitcoin. Nick Cote, a cryptocurrency trader, stated that bitcoin could test the $7,700 level in the upcoming days, and if it sustain its momentum, it could move back to the $8,000 region.\nCurrently, most cryptocurrencies in the market are moving in a correlated manner, and the vast majority of assets are following the price trend of bitcoin. Unified price movements of cryptocurrencies signals an unstable and immature market, and until cryptocurrencies begin to move in different directions, it seems as if the market would continue to remain unstable and highly volatile.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

They\u2019re going to develop futures markets, options markets, I even think you\u2019re going to start to see interest rate markets around bitcoin. We\u2019re used to hearing things about Libor, the index for bitcoin interest rates is Bibor,\u201d said Matonis.\nWhen Will Banks Enter?\nThe cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile, both on the upside and downside. One of the primary reasons behind the extreme volatility of the market is its lack of liquidity. The daily trading volume of bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies has substantially declined since a major correction occurred in January, along with the bitcoin price.\nA significant drop in the daily volume of bitcoin has allowed whales and institutional investors in the futures market to manipulate the market, which is one of the reasons as to why the market has demonstrated correlated price movements over the past few months.\nRecently, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) has proposed to the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on US stock markets like Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The entrance of large financial institutions like Goldman Sachs will lead to more institutional and retail traders entering the cryptocurrency space.\nAs of current, the demand from institutional investors in the US is relatively high, but actual capital coming in to the cryptocurrency market from the public finance industry is almost non-existent. In Japan however, institutional investors are investing large sums of money in cryptocurrencies through trading platforms that specifically address retail traders.\nMatonis further emphasized that to the skeptics that have described bitcoin as a bubble, bitcoin is not a bubble, but a pin that would pop the global financial bubble. He stated that equity markets and bond markets are the multi-trillion dollar bubbles that would inevitably burst in the mid-term.\n\u201cTo the people who say bitcoin\u2019s a bubble, I would say bitcoin is the pin that\u2019s going to pop the bubble. The bubble is the insane bond markets and the fake equity markets that are propped up by the central banks. Those are the bubbles,\u201d Matonis added.\nIt is uncertain though when major financial institutions will be ready to enter the market. Critically, the cryptocurrency market\u2019s image over the past few months has been portrayed as a gambling ecosystem, especially by the mainstream media in regions like South Korea. If the market recovers in the short-term and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin rebound to their all-time highs, banks will prepare to address the growing demand towards the market.\nBear Cycle\nIn a bear cycle or a slump, financial institutions will not be hurrying to enter the market, unless they want to establish themselves at the forefront of cryptocurrency development prior to their competitors. It would take at least a few months to see major banks enter the space. But, when they do, the cryptocurrency market will be equipped with significant liquidity and public investment vehicles.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Jooyeon Technology recently released the Hash Guard, a CPU that contains 4 Nvidia GTX 1080 ti, a graphic card that is known to operate with minimal fan noise and water-cooling system to prevent the CPU from overheating.\n\nDespite its high performance, one downside of the Hash Guard is its price. It costs more than $8,000, which is as expensive as one of the most costly CPUs in the world, manufactured by Apple. Still, because of its specifications and most importantly, its ability to mine cryptocurrencies with minimal resources, the demand for CPUs with high performance graphic cards has increased in South Korea.\nEKN, a local media outlet, reported that investors within the cryptocurrency market has shifted from conventional investment in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum to mining. Since CPUs like Hash Guard can be established and operate in a normal home with basic electricity consumption, investors can produce small-scale cryptocurrencies with substantial profits without allocating significant resources.\nA spokesperson of Jooyeon Technology, the manufacturer of one of the country\u2019s most popular CPU cryptocurrency miner, told EKN that many investors have started to utilize CPUs to mine initial coin offering (ICO) tokens, with hopes that the tokens they mine will increase exponentially in value.\n\u201cApart from warranty and free of charge after sales service provided by a domestic PC manufacturer, the ability to utilize cryptocurrency miners as normal CPUs for work and casual use cases has led to an increase in demand towards CPU miners,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cA large portion of consumers are also anticipating and hoping that the price of ICO tokens increase, and are mining tokens with CPUs with big expectations.\u201d\nThe spokesperson further emphasized that CPUs that fall behind the Hash Guard and Nvidia graphic cards can also mine smaller cryptocurrencies such as Monero, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, and Bitcoin Gold if CPUs operate 24 hours a day. For instance, the spokesperson stated that a two-way home cryptocurrency mining CPU equipped with AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7 and RX570 can mine 0.0032 Ether, 0.00158 Monero, 0.1 Ethereum Classic, 0.0062 Zcash, and 0.023 Bitcoin Gold per day, if the CPU runs for 24 hours.\nMajor Correction\nAnalysts in the CPU manufacturing sector in South Korea noted that the demand for high performance gaming chips from Nvidia and AMD is on the rise because of the recent correction of the cryptocurrency market. Since January, most major cryptocurrency has fallen by more than 70 percent from their all-time highs.\nConsequently, investors have started to search for alternative methods to generate profit in an extremely volatile period for the cryptocurrency market.\nBut, in the mid-term, issues may arise with CPUs, and with CPU mining in general, as more ASIC miners are released by companies like Bitmain and Samsung.", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

Consequently, some observers have taken this to mean that Bitmain believes that either Ethereum will ultimately fail to abandon PoW or that the shift to PoS will result in another Ethereum Classic-style hard fork.\nThat said, a hard fork to maintain ASIC resistance would not be unprecedented. Privacy-centric cryptocurrency Monero has committed to altering its version of the Cryptonight PoW algorithm every six months to inhibit the development of XMR-compatible miners.

Earlier today, the price of bitcoin dropped to $7,530, after peaking at $8,150 less than 20 hours ago.\n\nFutures Market\nThroughout the past 4 hours, sell volumes intensified across all major cryptocurrency exchanges, and the market was likely affected by the spike in volumes in the US bitcoin futures market operated by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and CME Group.\nPhil, a well known cryptocurrency analyst better recognized as PhilCrypto, revealed that the bitcoin futures market recorded record volumes over the past 24 hours, and according to the publicly available data shared by CME Group and Cboe, the majority of volumes on both futures market are sell volumes.\n\nCME #Bitcoin futures seeing record volumes right now pic.twitter.com/mf6TJrVSfQ\n\u2014 Phil\u26a1\ufe0f (@PhilCrypto77) March 28, 2018\nInitially, the cryptocurrency community viewed the launch of the bitcoin futures market as an optimistic development for the global cryptocurrency market, as the community believed it would lead to a surge in volumes and improve the cryptocurrency market\u2019s liquidity.\nUndoubtedly, the entrance of investors from the traditional finance industry through the futures market led to an improvement in the market\u2019s liquidity. But, although the volumes of the market have increased, the futures market has had a negative impact on the cryptocurrency market over the past few months.\nWhereas large-scale institutional investors were not able to take advantage of the market and manipulate the price of cryptocurrencies on exchanges, through the futures market, retail traders have started to move large sums of money to sway the market.\nRealistically, some of the factors mentioned by the media such as the cryptocurrency advertisement ban by Twitter and Facebook have had minimal impact on the price of cryptocurrencies. To understand the irrelevance of the advertisements on both platforms, it is important to acknowledge the reason behind the ban.\nBoth platforms has banned cryptocurrency ads due to increasing advertisements from aggressive initial coin offerings (ICOs). As Nathaniel Poppers from the New York Times previously reported, the vast majority of ICOs have turned out to be either failed projects or scams.\n\nkey takeaway from a dive into ICO data and success rates: 81% of ICO\u2019s were Scams, ~6% Failed, ~5% had Gone Dead, and ~8% went on to trade on a exchange https://t.co/EZ6dMhroy8 pic.twitter.com/Xcj4jvvB8V\n\u2014 Nathaniel Popper (@nathanielpopper) March 26, 2018\nIt is only logical in the part of Twitter and Facebook to ban cryptocurrency ads unless they want to be responsible for the losses of investors, given that the government will attempt to accuse the two platforms for promoting ICOs by allowing advertisements from projects.\nHence, it is overreaching to claim that the ban on advertisements by the two social media giants or any other irrelevant factor led to the decline of the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nWhat Happens to the Market?\nAs CCN reported on March 27, it is unlikely that the market will recover in the short-term, or in the next few weeks. Several experts including bitcoin remittance company Abra CEO Bill Barhydt stated that bitcoin will initiate a strong rally later this year, and all \u201chell will break loose as a result.\u201d\n\u201cI talk to hedge funds, high net worth individuals, even commodity speculators.

In its official statement, the Binance team and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known to the community simple as CZ, stated that they agree on the government of Malta\u2019s long-term aim to evolve the country into \u201cThe Blockchain Island.\u201d\nCZ stated:\n\u201cAfter meeting with Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Silvio Schembri, we were impressed by the logical, clear and forward thinking nature of Malta\u2019s leadership. After reviewing a proposal bill, we are convinced that Malta will be the next hotbed for innovative blockchain companies, and a centre of the blockchain ecosystem in Europe. Binance is committed to lending our expertise to help shape a healthy regulatory framework as well as providing funds for other blockchain startups to grow the industry further in Malta.\u201d\nFor awhile, Binance has clarified its stance towards cryptocurrency-to-fiat trading, and firmly told its investors and users that plans to integrate cryptocurrency-to-fiat pairs are not on the horizon. But, its relocation to Malta and potential establishment of new banking partners could allow Binance to add cryptocurrency-to-fiat pairs with ease, without regulatory uncertainty and conflict with banking service providers.\nAlready, Binance has revealed its plans to launch a decentralized digital asset exchange called Binance Chain. Although the entire concept of a decentralized exchange defeats the purpose and renders the existence of centralized exchanges unnecessary, the Binance team\u2019s aim from the beginning has been to provide every service that can be accommodated to a wide of users.\nHence, given the roadmap of Binance\u2019s development, it is only logical for the company to move from cryptocurrency-only trading, to decentralized exchange, to cryptocurrency-to-fiat trading.\nBitfinex to Switzerland\nAnother major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, a Taiwan and Hong Kong-based trading platform that processes cryptocurrency-to-US dollar trades, has been eyeing permanent relocation to Switzerland, as CCN previously reported.\nFor many years, Switzerland and Zug in particular, have been known as the blockchain capital of the world, primarily because of its friendly regulations towards initial coin offering (ICO) projects and cryptocurrency businesses.\nMost notably, EOS, the sixth largest cryptocurrency in the world with a $4.5 billion market valuation, is based in Switzerland.\nBitfinex CEO Jean-Louis van der Velde emphasized that the company has had constructive talks with Swiss authorities, and is carefully considering its move from Asia to Switzerland.\n\u201cWe are looking for a new permanent home for Bitfinex and the parent company iFinex, where we want to merge the operations previously spread over several locations,\u201d said Velde.\nThe relocation of Bitfinex from Taiwan to Switzerland would lead to two of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges leaving Asia to Europe within a single month. If leading cryptocurrency businesses continue to move out of Asia due to impractical regulations to Europe, it could lead to Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong losing their dominance over the global market, and could trigger competition amongst global economies to house cryptocurrency businesses.", "category": "Exchanges"}

Within weeks, the price of bitcoin peaked at $19,000, surpassing $24,000 in South Korea.\nExtreme Volatility\nBut, as it did on the upward movement, the price of bitcoin fell quickly from its peak at $19,000 to $6,000, experiencing the third worst correction in its history with a 72 percent decline from its all-time high. Currently, the price of bitcoin remains at $7,400, the price of bitcoin in early November.\nThe January correction of bitcoin has been brutal, and it sank the entire market with it. More or less, most cryptocurrencies in the market followed the price trend of bitcoin over the past few months and bitcoin has actually outperformed most cryptocurrencies in the market throughout 2018.\nCboe and CME launched their bitcoin futures market in the first week of December. Prior to the launch, CME chairman Leo Melamed confirmed the plans of CME to launch its bitcoin futures market as early as November. On November 7, as CCN reported, Melamed stated:\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very important step for bitcoin\u2019s history\u2026We will regulate, make bitcoin not wild, nor wilder. We\u2019ll tame it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules.\u201d \nThe optimism and enthusiasm displayed by both Cboe and CME executives led the cryptocurrency market to highly anticipate a short-term surge in the volumes and prices of cryptocurrencies. Within weeks, the price of bitcoin nearly tripled, and other cryptocurrencies like Ripple and Tron enjoyed a significant increase in value.\nHowever, the cryptocurrency market and investors within it failed to acknowledge that prior to the futures market, the global cryptocurrency market wasn\u2019t all that liquid, and daily trading volumes across most exchanges were relatively low. The low liquidity of the cryptocurrency market made it easier for retail traders and institutional investors in the public market to manipulate the prices of cryptocurrencies.\n\nEarlier today, on March 29, the bitcoin futures market on both Cboe and CME options exchange saw record volumes. Yet, the price of bitcoin fell from $8,000 to $7,300. There has not been much interest in the cryptocurrency market from institutional investors and retail traders in the west, whereas in regions like Japan and South Korea, institutional investors have already started to invest in the market.\nCryptocurrency remittance firm Abra CEO Bill Barhydt stated:\n\u201cThere really is zero large-scale institutional money from the west in crypto right now.

After today\u2019s eight percent decline, Ethereum has a $40.7 billion market cap and a 14.5 percent share of the index (down from ~20 percent in February).\nEthereum Price Chart\nThe Ripple price, meanwhile, dipped to about $0.53 on European cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp.

Trying to time the market is \u201cchallenging\u201d because bitcoin even in its short history has proven to generate most of its annual returns over less than a two-week period each year, according to Lee in a note entitled \u201cWhy HODL?\u201d\nLee also recently recommended that bitcoin investors buy the dip, and now he\u2019s adding to it, saying, \u201cwe think investors should be patient buyers of bitcoin here.\u201d\u00a0It may be easier said than done, given the fact that bitcoin remains lower by double-digit percentage year-to-date.\u00a0Patience, however, is a virtue when investing, whether it\u2019s the stock market or cryptocurrencies.\nLee said: \u201cMarket timing is generally discouraged in traditional equity investing.\u201d He went on to provide the following example \u2013\n\u201cIf an investor missed out on the 10 best days (for S&P 500) each year, the annualized return drops to 5.4 percent (ex-10 best), from 9.2 percent. In other words, the case for buy and hold in equities is the opportunity cost of missing out on the 10 best days.\u201d\nThe strategy is vital for bitcoin investing. Say you try to time the market and miss out on BTC\u2019s best 10 days of the year. You would be sacrificing as much as 25% of annualized returns in the interim, says Lee. Without the best 10 days of trading performance, bitcoin posts 25% losses annually, as per the Fundstrat report obtained by CCN.\nCourtesy: Fundstrat\n\u2018Positive Catalysts\u2019\nThe pressure is real, and bitcoin is struggling to break out beyond the USD 8,000 level, which as Fundstrat points out is the breakeven price for BTC mining. But bitcoin investors can breathe a sigh of relief.\n\u201cThe overhang from regulatory risk is generally keeping investors sidelined. However, we see positive catalysts for Bitcoin later in 2018, including the clarification of regulatory hurdles.\u201d \u2014 Fundstrat analysts\nEarlier this month, Fundstrat\u2019s Lee warned that altcoins, which had ridden on the coattails of bitcoin during the leading cryptocurrency\u2019s record run, are headed for a period of \u201cpurgatory\u201d to unfold for 150-175 days before the lesser known coins resume their upward climb. Fundstrat paints a picture of a cyclical market for altcoins, which is another parallel to the broader equity markets. As for the leading coins, Lee and his research team are predicting a \u201cstrong\u201d 2018 led by \u201cmore established blockchains growing\u201d and \u201cupside for ETH and BTC.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Everywhere you turn, there\u2019s a new forecast for the bitcoin price \u2014 from $30,000 to $3,500.\u00a0Technical analysis, which is used by traders to forecast whether securities are going to move higher or lower, has been around for more than a century. It was used by Charles Dow in the late 1800s and is still relied upon today.\nNow traders who rely on price and volume charts are applying the method to cryptocurrencies, and bitcoin is encroaching upon the dreaded death cross \u2014 when charts reflect a \u201ccrossover\u201d between the 50-day (short-term trend) and 200-day (longer-term trend) moving averages, as pointed out by CNBC. While bitcoin has already been trading in a bear market for 2018, the death cross would mean that it would become more pervasive of a trend.\n\u00a0\nCourtesy: CNBC\nIs the Trend Your Friend?\nTechnical analysis throws reason out the window and focuses on the what more than the why. It\u00a0focuses on long-term charting data to determine where the price is headed and by how much. The problem with applying technical analysis to bitcoin is that it doesn\u2019t have decades of trading history from which to draw analysis, let alone multiple death cross\u00a0cycles from which to gain perspective.\nHistorically, a death cross trading pattern in the stock market could be a \u201cbullish contrarian indicator,\u201d as the Wall Street Journal pointed out years ago. And don\u2019t look now but the stock market remains in a bull market run despite volatility, conditions the cryptocurrency markets know all too well.\nDoom and Gloom\nBut the BTC price dropped below the 100-day moving average, which has some traders skittish. On the doom and gloom side of things,\u00a0Jim Iuorio of TJM Institutional Services told CNBC that despite the lack of\u00a0historical evidence in bitcoin trading \u2013\n\u201c[Any] time the 50-day crosses the 200-day, it should flash a warning\u2026and when you couple that with the fact that bitcoin has been trending steadily lower since the launch of futures, I think that it is a major negative.\u201d\nCCN recently reported about a technical analyst predicting that if bitcoin hit the death cross, it would tumble to $2,800. Others were calling a near-term bottom of $5,873.\nGlass Half Full\nDigital asset fund manager Brian Kelly, on the other hand, is watching the uptrend \u2013\n\u201cBitcoin, just like the spot FX markets, follows technicals closely, therefore these support levels gain more importance. If these levels hold, then it will confirm the uptrend from August is still valid.\u201d\nIf we look at the evidence thus far, bitcoin reached a death cross in 2015 when it was trading in the $200 range. But in that same year, the bitcoin price more than doubled to nearly $500. Bitcoin hasn\u2019t touched on a death cross since that time.", "category": "Bitcoin Trading"}

Regulators have been unable to stamp out the burgeoning industry completely, but the closure of mainland-based cryptocurrency exchanges has led to a steep decline in trading volume over the past six months.\nNevertheless, many observers are optimistic that China will soften its hostile approach to cryptocurrency in the future, particularly following the appointment of Yi Gang as PBoC governor.\nAs CCN reported, Yi said earlier this month that Bitcoin \u201cis a currency that provides freedom to anyone that uses it,\u201d adding that it is a transparent medium of exchange.", "category": "FinTech News"}

Within the discussion of the community leader\u2019s proposal can be found discussion of Ethereum price, Buterin himself, other blockchain designs, and, of course, plenty of discussion about economic theory.\n\nFor those still wondering whether or not https://t.co/z44anVrOuT was an April Fool's joke, the answer is: it was an April Fool's meta-joke. *The point* was seeing people argue about whether or not the proposal is \"real\".\n\u2014 Vitalik \"Not giving away ETH\" Buterin (@VitalikButerin) April 2, 2018\n\nWhile we can appreciate the good-natured trolling, there certainly is news here: Buterin followed up his meta-joke by clarifying that he does in fact believe there is reason to consider capping the Ethereum supply. In the joking version of his EIP, Buterin even had a specific number in mind: 120 million Ether.\nI recommend setting MAX_SUPPLY = 120,204,432, or exactly 2x the amount of ETH sold in the original ether sale.\nWe therefore thought our readers might be interested to understand what this would actually mean for Ethereum.\nLimitless Inflation v. Limited Supply\nFor the uninitiated, cryptocurrencies are not, in fact, gold. (And for the truly novice, the \u201climited\u201d nature of the supply of rare metals is not as important as the same in Bitcoin since said \u201climit\u201d in metals is unknown.) Once mined they do not sit on a shelf until stolen, tampered with, or traded. They do quite the opposite. But it takes a great deal of effort to maintain this situation. In order to reach consensus on a public blockchain, you require some method of finding indisputable agreement. There are various methods of doing this.\nIn crypotcurrency, we have algorithms which increasingly high-powered computers can compete to satisfy \u2014 this is called proof-of-work. It is the first blockchain design in mass use and the one that both Ethereum and Bitcoin currently use. Necessarily, proof-of-stake requires a continuing supply of new tokens to enter the system and reward stakeholders. Stakeholders do the work of maintaining accurate records and publishing new transactions that miners do in a proof-of-work system, and Ethereum is currently planning to transition to such a system with the eventual Casper upgrade.\nBy design, Ethereum has never had a hard limit on its tokens, but instead has an in-built incentive in the form of a \u201cdifficulty ice age\u201d which is meant to encourage developers to do what they are intending with Casper.\nThe original supply was based on how many tokens were distributed during the Ethereum Initial Coin Offering. In his \u201cimprovement proposal,\u201d Buterin argues that \u201cin light of the fact that issuing new coins to proof of work miners is no longer an effective way of promoting an egalitarian coin distribution or any other significant policy goal.\u201d\n120,204,432 Hard Cap\nThe proposal works as an addition to the Casper major upgrade. He makes the effective point that the system could, in the future, reach what amounts to a supply neutral status, where network fees and staking rewards cancel each other out, and throws out the number 120,204,432 (twice the number of Ether created during the ICO) as the ceiling.\nThe proposal might even later be considered and implemented down the road after the Casper protocol upgrade. That\u2019s at the behest of the Ethereum community and its developer class. \u00a0As for Buterin, it would seem to the honest journalist that with this activity he was either doing his normal routine to get some attention on Ethereum early this week or he legitimately wants there to be more discussion about the implications of a limitless supply proof-of-stake token underpinning one of the world\u2019s most (exponentially) important blockchains.\n\nIn reality, of course, it should not matter. The proposal is very real in the sense that the words actually were written in the github issue, and the arguments for it are real arguments.\n\u2014 Vitalik \"Not giving away ETH\" Buterin (@VitalikButerin) April 2, 2018\n\nTo Buterin, it would seem, \u201cegalitarianism\u201d and community should be at the heart of all decisions.\n\nIf the community wants fixed supply and people believe that EIP 960 is a good way to achieve that, then it should adopt the proposal. If the community does not, then it should not. This is true regardless of whether or not the original intent was in jest.\n\u2014 Vitalik \"Not giving away ETH\" Buterin (@VitalikButerin) April 2, 2018\n", "category": "Altcoin News"}

This is orders of magnitude less than any other approach,\u201d the site claims.\nDespite the hefty price tag, the company claims that so many projects have expressed interest that it has had to institute a $750 registration fee to prevent staff from being overwhelmed with applications.\nResponding to critics, McAfee denied that he has \u201csold out\u201d and said that he only promotes projects that he believes in.\n\u201cThey say I sold out \u2019cause I use my tweets to promote, but the last 200 ICOs that lined up, we rejected 195 and chose 5,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, adding that all applications undergo an audit. \u201cI only promote what I believe.\u201d", "category": "ICO News"}

A Phoenix federal jury has now found the Arizona resident guilty of five counts of money laundering.\nTrading Bitcoin with undercover agents, Costanzo encouraged cryptocurrency as a means of purchasing illegal drugs. Without providing transparency about transactions, crypto was promoted as a way to limit exposure with law enforcement.\nFound guilty of exchanging nearly $165,000 from alleged drug traffickers (undercover federal agents) over the course of two years, Costanzo failed to identify his customers. He also concealed proceeds and charged anywhere from seven to ten percent commission for peer-to-peer transactions, rather than functioning within the legal limits for online exchange.\nArizona\u2019s Bitcoin Laws\nAccording to Arizona\u2019s HB2417 bill, passed last spring:\n\u201cSMART CONTRACTS MAY EXIST IN COMMERCE.

And just because one man can\u2019t manage to govern himself, the future of crypto is not at risk.\nEven for those questioning the SEC\u2019s inquiries into crypto regulations, regulations such as Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verifications serve to protect all involved, necessary when it comes to potential trading with criminals such as Costanzo.", "category": "Bitcoin Crime"}

Over the past 12 hours, buy volumes have spiked on Bitfinex, Binance, and other trading platforms, as seen below in the bitcoin 30-minute candle chart.\n\nOn March 25, the price of bitcoin achieved $9,000, with relatively strong volumes on both the bitcoin futures market and cryptocurrency exchanges. However, since then, bitcoin has been on a continuous decline. Bitcoin tested several levels, including $8,800 and $8,000, but failed to sustain momentum and dropped to $6,400.\nOver the next few days, if bitcoin can sustain its volume and surpass the $7,500 margin, it is likely that bitcoin could make a move back to the $8,000 region, moving to where it was five days ago. Its entrance to the $8,000 region could lead bitcoin to prepare for a strong rally.\nCurrently, the the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of bitcoin is at 39.2, which is at a neutral level. Previously, the RSI of bitcoin was at 30, signifying oversold conditions. At the time of reporting, bitcoin is being traded in a neutral zone, and the cryptocurrency has not demonstrated overwhelming demand or sell volumes.\nConsequently, the next few days could be an important short-term period for bitcoin, as it has increased by more than $700 over the past 48 hours, and it is starting to gain some momentum, according to bitcoin\u2019s moving average convergence divergence (MACD).\nJon Matonis, a well recognized investor, co-founder at Bitcoin Foundation, and an executive at VISA, stated that in the mid-term, the entrance of financial institutions like Goldman Sachs could lead to a surge in demand towards bitcoin. If the dominant cryptocurrency can recover from its current bear cycle, analysts like Matonis predict a bull run for bitcoin later this year.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fabulous that they\u2019re getting into it because it brings in new liquidity.

More specifically, the initiative is aiming to empower the country\u2019s most impoverished, a demographic that mostly consists of a particular caste known as \u2018Dalits\u2019. Individuals belonging the Dalit community are often subjected to extreme discrimination from the moment they are born, leaving them with no choice but to lead a life of poverty.\nThe Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DICCI) is spearheading the program with the help of a cryptocurrency-related platform, Mahabfic, and social entrepreneur, Dr. Tausif Malik. According to DICCI and Mahabfic, the collaboration will result in the \u2018world\u2019s first and largest Bitcoin Mining Training Program (BMTP) for self-employment.\u2019\nDICCI founder, Shri Milind Kamble, stated that the main objective of the program is to\u00a0\u201cempower the rural population especially the youth from the farming community to earn income from their hometown or villages, this would create new economic development in these areas.\u2019\nCryptocurrencies have been a saving grace for several such communities, including some African countries where the trend of crypto mining and entrepreneurship is emerging rapidly. Increased adoption rates in these regions have also driven up the viability of such occupations.\nKamble added,\n\u201cThe new blockchain technology is the future of technology development and taking the world by storm and bitcoin-cryptocurrency mining is a must for blockchain platform to operate. Hence, we felt the need to offer bitcoin-cryptocurrency mining training program (BMTP) to our youth on a nationwide scale for self-employment.\u201d\nWhile the problem of caste disparity is on the decline, especially in the more affluent regions of India, there is no doubt that a sizeable segment of the population continues to be affected by the practice. A Dalit farmer in the state of Gujarat, for instance, was reportedly beaten to death by extremists as recently as last week. The local police not only confirmed that the attack was caste-motivated, but also said that it was in retaliation to the individual owning livestock, a symbol of prestige for the farming folk.\nThe issue of untouchability is a major problem for India, a country that has boldly announced its plans to be a superpower within the next few decades. Several Bollywood films have also touched on the topic in some way or another in a bid to encourage social reform among the masses. For a country with a population of well over one billion though, changing public perception about the Dalit class and giving them equal opportunities might as well partially happen through the cryptocurrency asset class.", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

The patent covers a \u201cvirtual draft system and method\u201d and includes the words \u201cblock chain\u201d in such combination exactly 10 times.\nThe patent application, like most patent applications, uses the broadest possible language when describing blockchain technology, such that it\u2019s not immediately evident what we\u2019re reading about when they say something like:\n[\u2026] a signal representing a request comprising a first transfer from a first digital container associated with a first client to a second digital container associated with a second client; compare a value of the first transfer to a total value in one or more accounts associated with the first client, wherein at least one of the one or more accounts associated with the first client has a value in a first currency; and generate a first draft from a first account to an account associated with the second client, wherein the first draft comprises a value in a second currency equivalent to the value of the first transfer.\nUS Patent 20180089645\nThe patent falls under several international classifications pertaining to payments and remittance, and even things like missed tolls.\nUS Patent 20180089645 is essentially talking about one part of a new point-of-sale system TD Bank either has in the works or would like to own some intellectual property surrounding. It describes a modern computer (must have processor and storage attached to qualify) which can negotiate payments between currencies.\nAlso read: Canadian Bank to Offer Secure Vault for Cryptocurrencies\nVirtual Draft System and Method\nFrom the sounds, the user will have a form of payment which grants access to multiple accounts, and one of these accounts must have funds in the currency being dealt in. Another provision of the system described is that it will sometimes support \u2014 yep \u2014 blockchain tokens, such as Ether or Bitcoin.\nThis disclosure provides systems and methods for real-time drafting for transactions including a transfer of a digital asset tracked as a distributed electronic ledger, such as a block-chain ledger. A first party initiates a transaction including a transfer of a digital asset, such as a distributed ledger-based currency. The transaction is provided to a central authority for authorization and/or real-time drafting.\nSuch payment forms exist today, wherein essentially all of one\u2019s accounts can be accessed, but they are very nascent. If there\u2019s any group which will take more interest in this development than cryptocurrency enthusiasts, it will be Paypal and similar efforts as well as other banks who may have either competing products or existing intellectual property.\nCan You Patent the Blockchain?\nThe patent appears to carefully avoid patenting an entire blockchain network by extolling a number of \u201cembodiments\u201d or manners in which this system can manifest itself. Patent trolling is a storied practice in the earliest days of the 21st century, in which property rights have found all new boundaries. Someone else can own data that appears on your device, and your personal information can belong to a corporation based on another continent.\nHowever, for those who fear intellectual property and its associated frictions with open source are on their way to the blockchain, and who\u2019ve raised the alarms for years since the rise of Coinbase, well, their fears are not entirely unjustified. Erich Spangenberg, who\u2019s spent his career gobbling up patents and queuing up litigation surrounding them, has started a firm specifically with the intention of consolidating blockchain IP. In this blog on the subject, he admits:\nWhile tempted to just trade, at some point in 2016, it occurred to me that blockchain could have a massively beneficial impact on the patent industry and patent asset class. I had some positively stupid initial ideas, but by 2017, the crazy ideas started to slow down and the better ones took over. I began assembling the team of programmers, data scientists, communications specialists and patent wonks we would need to implement and create a new business model that intelligently captures the power of blockchain in the patent space.\nAlthough many computer scientists may disagree with software patents or the patent system as a whole, Spangenberg is certainly correct that the patent office is already dealing with crypto cases. Why, just last week Ford was issued a patent for some kind of fuel token. And then, of course, self-proclaimed Craig \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d Wright has also lined up a fair bit of business for the courts.", "category": "Banking"}

The visit shed light on the extent of the government\u2019s efforts to create a national cryptocurrency. The reporters visited the Bank of China Credit Card Industry Development Co., Ltd. Hangzhou Blockchain Technology Research Institute.\nStandards Announced\nChina\u2019s ministry of industry and information technology revealed last week that it has already conducted a study exploring a framework for standardizing blockchain technology domestically. The ministry\u2019s information and software services division and the China Electronics Standardization Institute proposed that a new technical committee to be established.\nThe embracive stance toward blockchain technology is in stark contrast to China\u2019s crippling curbs against local cryptocurrency markets which have seen initial coin offerings (ICOs) outlawed and crypto exchanges phased out to effectively shutter domestic trading markets.\nThe China Banknote Bank Credit Card Industry Development Co., Ltd., one of the core companies of the China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation, is the earliest team to study digital currency and blockchain technology within the central bank system, sina.com.cn reported.\nThe team last year established the Banknote Blockchain Technology Institute.\nLeading the team is the central bank\u2019s science and technology leader Zhang Yifeng. According to Yifeng, the overall research and development team is less than 100 people.\nThe Project Progresses\nThe China Boxer Blockchain Technology Research Institute has applied for 22 blockchain technology invention patents so far, sina.com.cn reported.\nThe team\u2019s underlying technology architecture has been completed and the central bank\u2019s digital billing business has also been completed, according to Yifeng. Currently, it is promoting the opening and closing of a blockchain registration platform.\nYifeng said the most important part of the blockchain is to re-optimize the technology in combination with the actual business while looking for application scenarios.\nNot only can the participants of the platform use it, they can also conduct institutional certification and circulation, and achieve mutual trust and cooperation among all parties.\nThe biggest difference between digital currency and the existing electronic payment is that it can be account-based or non-account-based, Yifeng said.\nDigital currency seeks to facilitate the convenience, speed and low cost of a retail payment system, while at the same time providing security and protection of user privacy.\nAlso read: \u2018ASAP\u2019: China\u00a0 is working toward national blockchain standards\nOnly The Official Cryptocurrency Recognized\nOnly the statutory digital currency issued by the central bank is the real digital currency, he said.

Digital currency still needs to satisfy the basic attributes of money, and the basic characteristics of value scale, exchange media, payment instruments, and value storage have not changed.\nThe coins issued by ICO are even more ridiculous, Yifeng said. In addition, he asked, how can a sovereign credit currency act as a liquidity instrument and payment instrument?\nThere is no clear timetable for the launch of the legal digital currency, he said.\nMeanwhile, the Blockchain Technology Research Institute will establish cooperative relationships with a number of universities and research institutes to promote research in areas such as cryptography algorithms, zero-knowledge proofs, and distributed technologies. At the same time, it will apply for more financial technology patents.\nThe Digital Billing Platform based on blockchain technology that was undertaken by the Group of China Boxer Blockchain Technology Research Institute in 2016 was successfully tested on the Stock Exchange on Jan. 25 this year, according to sina.com.cn.\nFan Guiluo, chairman of China Bills Credit Card Industry Development Co., Ltd., said that blockchain, as a trusted technology, will be used under the trustworthy system of the Chinese banknote printing and minting company.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

With the exception of a handful of cryptocurrencies, which have been likely affected by pump and dumps, most of the cryptocurrencies in the global market have all moved in a similar pattern since the major correction occurred in February.\nAs such, given the extreme volatility in the market and its correlated price movements, it is evident that the market has not stabilized from its recent correction, and thus may need more time to recover from its losses. \nThe market demonstrated a necessary rebound from the $250 billion mark, and major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been able to sustain their resistance levels, even though volumes still remain relatively low across all cryptocurrency exchanges.\nHistory\nBitcoin\u2019s latest correction has been brutal, and it led to millions of dollars in losses for many individuals and institutional investors holding the cryptocurrency on behalf of organizations. But, it is important to acknowledge that identical patterns have occurred in the past, throughout 2013 to 2018.\n2018\u2019s bitcoin correction is the third worst correction the cryptocurrency has ever experienced, after two 80 percent corrections it suffered in 2013 and 2014. Both corrections took nearly 12 months for bitcoin to recover from.\nThe market moves up and down, and volatility is stronger in markets like the cryptocurrency market that have lower liquidity and volume than other regulated markets. The cryptocurrency market was not largely affected by the prohibition of cryptocurrency ads or other news relating to regulation, contrary to the narrative the media has tried to portray. Rather, it was the market simply acknowledging that the price of most cryptocurrencies have increased to a point in which they were difficult to justify based on tangibles and sustainable models.\n\u00a0\nTron for example, was worth $16 billion, and neared the valuation of SpaceX.

The number of cryptocurrencies that are launched on a daily basis makes it imperative that there should be a better-organized system of management and transaction than what is currently available.\nFor a technology that is still seeking adoption into the mainstream, an easy entry and communication system will go a long way towards the establishment. Existing storage systems (wallets) for cryptocurrencies and the setup of the currently available exchanges makes it a bit cumbersome to operate within the ecosystem.\nEliminating Complexities in Crypto\nThe above-mentioned limitations are not going unnoticed within the industry as various solution companies are providing alternative methods that could solve the problems depending on users peculiarities.\nAccording to Jeremy Epstein, CEO of Never Stop Marketing, one of the critical and necessary developments that will reduce the complexity of digital asset management will involve the creation of trusted multisig wallets. For example, if something happens to me, how can I make sure that my loved ones have access to the coins and/or digital assets? Alternatively, what if someone holds me up for my crypto? How do we make sure that a robber can\u2019t run away with the money?\nEpstein explains that outside of individual use cases, we have to think about corporate governance. If a company takes payment for a good or a service in crypto, those coins need to be protected and not held in one person\u2019s account. This is a big barrier to mainstream adoption.\nOn the issue of \u2018crypto-crypto\u2019 and \u2018crypto-fiat\u2019 compatibility, Epstein notes that there are improved systems already that are making it easier for users to transact across different communities. He notes that this is necessary because most centralized exchanges are designed to take advantage of retail investors. He also points out that nearly 90% of the trades on these platforms are done by the \u201chouse\u201d in order to manipulate the price so that retail investors get taken advantage of. However, decentralized exchanges like Bancor, for example, is already doing over $10million per day in volume. Services like Radar Relay, built on top of the 0x protocol is removing the risk associated with open order books. Also, blockchain interoperability platforms like ARK with their SmartBridge and Encoded Listeners are going to help people conduct relatively friction-free commerce across blockchains without holding the coins of the other network.\nA New Industry Development\nThe usability of these class of exchanges is not popular yet, neither is their speed. However, the momentum being generated among them is growing in significance. Emerging platforms like Alttex are also creating decentralized, multi-currency trading platforms. The company\u2019s CEO, Yevhenii Meita explains that the fact that the platform is decentralized, enables a more secure system, and prevents the exchange from hackers and DDoS-attacks.\n\u201cAltExchange security system is quite reliable. For an extra level of protection, we have enabled Touch ID, Face ID, and Pin-code functionality with two-factor authentication via email\u201d, says Meita.\nHe concludes by explaining that the platform will enable users to securely buy cryptocurrencies using a credit or debit card, and withdraw funds to it with minimum commissions. All that is needed for identity verification is two selfies showing both sides of the card using a specialized AltScanner.\nIt\u2019s all About the End User\nWhen dealing with practical implementation of cryptocurrencies and ease of application, the main subject is usually the end user. As a matter of fact, all is well as long as the end user is satisfied. This is an opinion that is shared by Co-Founder and Lead Developer at MoxyOne, Tanshul Kumar. Kumar notes that there is still a few roadblocks in terms of end-user design and simplification of processes. He explains to CCN that this is one of the key reasons why his organization will be working on developing a unique wallet system that will be done via thorough research into existing wallets and with modern UX design concepts. This he notes will improve the way people manage their cryptocurrencies and the ease with which they can spend them.\n\u201cMoxyOne will take everything good about existing digital storage solutions and work with specialist blockchain companies to ensure that we have the most secure and functional product available out there for our users and our Partner companies. It is by working together with other great blockchain assets and solutions that we can strive to improve our pre-existing systems and make cryptocurrencies much safer and easier to use for all\u201d, concludes Kumar.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

Often times, this popularity happens for the very wrong reasons, but in the long run, the dust usually settles and ideas take off with the correct solutions that they have to offer.\nThe Dark Years of Cyber Fraud\nBetween the final years of the 20th century and the very early years of the new millennium, the internet found its way unto the shores of the most populous black nation in the world. Despite the uncountable benefits that the new technology brings like we see and experience today, it was an effective tool in the hands of bad players who carried out different forms of scams and internet fraud. As a matter of fact, the stigma left by this development is yet to be erased completely as most online transaction websites still do not allow transactions passing through the Nigerian cyberspace.\nSuch developments as mentioned above may not be peculiar to Nigeria or Africa, however, the absence or rather slow rate of advancing the positives that come with new innovations makes it easy for bad players to overshadow genuine developments. Therefore a trend of sinking before attempting to climb out and thrive becomes repetitive.\nInsufficient Human Capital Investment\nThis slow rate of positive advancement can be largely attributed to the lack of adequate investment in the young people in the areas of education and health infrastructure by the nation\u2019s leaders, both past and present. This is a deficiency that was clearly noted by the Co-Chairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill Gates during his recent visit to the country.\nGates further defended his criticism of the nation\u2019s approach by saying:\n\u201cAs a partner in Nigeria, I am saying the current plan is inadequate. Nigeria has all these young people and the current quality and quantity of investment in these young generations; in health and education just isn\u2019t good enough. So, I was very direct. \u201cIf they can get health and education right, they will be an engine of growth not just for themselves but for all of Africa.\u201d\nClearly, this lack of proper human capital development leaves a vacuum that is usually filled by desperate actions by the youths who employ their wits in any way they deem appropriate for the sake of survival.\nDesperation is not exempted as one of the major forces behind the initial general opinion that was created with the influx of all manner of ponzi schemes within the past 18 months. These schemes camouflaged themselves under the umbrella of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, parading different forms of investment plans that have led to citizens losing their wealth to con artists and scammers. Apparently, it all boils down to the lack of proper knowledge and education, coupled with the \u2018get-rich-quick\u2019 mentality that is prevalent within the country.\nAn Institutional Warning\nAs a result, regulatory institutions seem to be currently responding by seeking ways of protecting the citizens from misguided investments. This is evident in the recent statement that was made by the Manager in charge of Research Department at the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), Mr. Adikwu Igoche.\nIgoche clarified that cryptocurrencies were not deposits or financial instruments authorized by the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN. Therefore, such instruments \u201care not insured by the NDIC\u201d and if anyone loses his money trading in the business, the person does so at his own risk.\n\u201cThese forms of currencies are not backed by any physical commodity, such as gold or other precious stones. \u201cThey do not belong to the category of currencies or coins issued by the CBN or the central bank of any other country,\u201d Igoche said.\nProper Education Matters\nAccording to him, the NDIC will not relent in sensitizing Nigerians to financial, operational, legal and security risks they face by patronizing ponzi schemes and digital currencies.\nApparently, for the umpteenth time, someone from the authorities lumps digital currencies and ponzi schemes together. This is a scenario that does not usually go down well with digital currency enthusiasts and blockchain experts both within and outside the country. This raises the question whether the agencies will continue in its traditional reactive approach of damage control or tow that path of Bill Gate\u2019s advice by investing in human capital, especially in areas of health and education. By doing so, youths within the nation may become discouraged from such desperate measures that they are becoming used to while equipping themselves to differentiate between genuine technology and fraudulent practices.", "category": "Banking"}

Tokens & Purpose", "url": "https://www.ccn.com/whats-next-for-cryptocurrencies-tokens-purpose/", "birthday": "2018-03-31T15:22:27+00:00", "date": "2018-03-31 15:22:27", "year": 2018, "month": 3, "day": 31, "content": "I know most of you are worried about price and the recent slump in the overall market valuation. Personally speaking, that does not concern me one bit as I believe this price and volume downfall is just temporary. As I mentioned before the market is no-where near maturity as the basis technology \u2013 distributed ledgers with economic incentives and applied game theory \u2013 has been created less than 10 years ago. I\u2019m talking about Satoshi\u2019s original vision.\n\u2013this article shouldn\u2019t be taken as financial advisement as it represents my personal opinion and views. I have savings invested in cryptocurrency so take whatever I write with a grain of salt. Do not invest what you cannot afford to lose and always read as much as possible about a project before investing. You\u2019re always responsible for your own money\u2013\nAs of today, there are 1594 cryptocurrencies available at coinmarketcap and the total market valuation represents $274,954,590,832. At its peak in January the value was close to $800 billion, meaning it lost close to 75% of its total valuation. Another interesting point to make is that bitcoin, during this peak, lost most of its dominance shifting from a 84% dominance to a merely 36%; it\u2019s now regaining traction as bitcoin market dominance currently sits at 45%.\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/charts/\nThe only conclusion I can take from this data is that people got hyped and invested a lot during the peak. Smart-money (whales and institutional investors) started to convert back cryptocurrency into fiat, due to the overvaluation of the assets. The only thing people now need is a bit of patience. Will the market regain growth? A way to analyse information is by looking at the recent past, like the overall market value evolution or the interest of people in bitcoin. You\u2019ll quickly see the cycles and notice something fairly obvious: like a sprinter\u2019s beating heart as it reaches the finish line, price grows faster and gains momentum as new money enters the market, due to nothing but news. (traditional media is usually quite good at creating hypes, both positive and negative).\n\nDo you see it? Whenever cryptocurrencies gain momentum, people\u2019s interest in bitcoin increases exponentially. Meaning, the likelihood of new money coming into the market grows as the price of bitcoin grows. The opposite also happens, meaning the more the price drops, the less people are interested in bitcoin (breaking news: are we really just a bunch of money-hungry savages?! Stick around to find out)\nAs I wrote in the beginning, let us shift away from all this. I wanted to first share my view so that you could understand why I\u2019m not worried one bit about price as I\u2019m into cryptocurrency for the long-term, not because I\u2019m simply mad.\n\u00a0\n\nDifferent tokens and their purpose\nWhen we discuss cryptocurrency we\u2019re usually talking about the entire space and most commonly there\u2019s no differentiation between currencies, asset tokens and utility tokens. Due to regulation authorities, it\u2019s important to differentiate between each type of token, as watchdogs are actively hunting down projects that show a lack of purpose, are seen as securities or just promise impossible high interest rates. If you\u2019re familiar with this concept, I challenge you to still stick around, as I propose different ways of measuring tokens. Without further a due, let\u2019s begin.\n1. Cryptocurrencies: as the name clearly states the purpose of these tokens is to be used as means of payment. Look at bitcoin, litecoin, monero or stellar for example. Each has a unique set of rules connected to their protocol which enables brand new features, like privacy, different hashing algorithms, rewards, economic incentives, validation mechanisms and even mining hardware. To me those are definitely features and not issues, as it\u2019s impossible to predict which combination will allow for the best optimized system. So far bitcoin is leading the way, maybe because it was the very first cryptocurrency to be created, or because its combination of features actually makes it the best digital currency at the present time. In my opinion, it\u2019s a mixture of both reasons; as we saw before people tend to look directly into bitcoin when they start their cryptocurrency journey, but at the same time no other cryptocurrency, rather than bitcoin, has won so many battles coming always on top. If you don\u2019t agree, just think which coin is the most used at the moment. This means that until now, no other currency has proven to be as resilient, capable to scale and to maintain security as bitcoin has. Only time will tell which combination of factors will win. Some can even argue that those don\u2019t matter at all and it\u2019s all about branding, marketing and hype.\n\n2. Cryptoassets: an asset can be virtually anything like company shares, personal data, deeds, contracts, etc. These cryptoassets can be categorized as securities because they entitle holders to a revenue share (like dividends) or to interest payments (like a fixed interest rate). Obviously regulator watchdogs cannot allow this to happen, as for companies to publicly trade their equity they must fulfill a list of demands like KYC/AML compliance for example. Most will agree this makes sense, otherwise projects like bitconnect will keep scamming investors, or most projects could raise funds from illegal money, like drug trafficking. Except I don\u2019t think this \u201cheavy-hand\u201d approach makes that much sense, for a simple reason: most illegal money is transacted via bank accounts. Meaning, rules and regulations are not the same to every financial agent that wants to compete in the market. If this is the case, as it happens to be, it makes no sense to impose regulation that only works for the small-fish, like me or my company for example. Want to better regulate the market? Teach people how to invest, how to spot harmful projects and crypto-based companies how to identify customers and how to avoid using illegal funding. If we\u2019re trying to create a fairer, more transparent world, let\u2019s at least try to create new regulation that can be better applied to everyone, with no exceptions (yes HSBC and JP Morgan, I\u2019m talking to you).\n\n3. Utility tokens: these are tokens which do not entitle holders to anything, except for the right to participate in the network. Or at least that\u2019s the broader definition I often read, which to me doesn\u2019t really make sense. Let me rephrase, it does make sense although highly incomplete.Do you think there is utility in creating an extra layer of complexity? I seriously doubt it. There is utility, however, when you optimize your token to the network in question. If you\u2019re building apps, it does make sense to create a token that can be used as a means of getting paid by doing some work, associated to a specific milestone, contract, code, whatever. For example Ethereum, Aragon and Clearpoll allow users to create decentralized organizations with voting rights (in the first two cases) or give users the right to submit news and to vote upon the veracity of those news. Siacoin, Substratum or Upfiring allow for people to decentralize their cloud computing requirements, as users can rent computer space to make some extra cash (in this case, tokens). To me that does seem like proper utility.\nShould utility only be associated to the ability of using tokens on a certain network? What if you create tokens that actually entitle users to profit, but they\u2019re given for free? This is, what if by using a platform you\u2019re given tokens which entitle you to a share of company profits? How can you consider that to be a security if no money was invested? What about airdrops? What about bounties? I personally have no answer for all that. If you get tokens by sharing time, resources or data should you be taxed upon those gains? If so, how can people easily do the math and know when/how much to contribute to their own governments? I know some people, like Ivan On Tech or Andreas Antonopolous, are working to find solutions around these problems which will hopefully make all our lives easier. Right now there are new laws being created around data protection that could be rendered useless, if money is not bought but given away for free. By spending time or attention, sharing data or knowledge, creating content in any form you would be rewarded. Always.\nCan you imagine a world where what matters is not money, but projects and goals? Anything you would do could compensate you for your time, in the form of tokens; and because tokens can be exchanged for any other asset, including cryptocurrency, liquidity could (maybe) not be a problem. Wouldn\u2019t this be a kinda of UBI?\n\u2013Don\u2019t forget, you should always research what tax regulation applies to cryptocurrency in your own country\u2013\nWhat about the economics around cryptocurrency?\nI think it\u2019s absolutely crucial to consider what cryptocurrency really is, how it really works and what it can really achieve. I\u2019m talking, of course, about the true decentralization of power. Have you ever heard:\n\nThat\u2019s because Money = Power. Think, who can create money? Governments and financial institutions. And what happens with the centralization of power? If you\u2019ve been following my articles you already know my personal stance on the matter:\nCryptocurrency might be the first truly decentralized system that can actually give back power to the people. No single central institution or government has the ability to print money, so there\u2019s no ability to control it. Oh boy, and people are indeed scared of that. Not the poor, tho, but the rich. The absolutely filthy rich are the ones truly worried about what will happen.\n\u201cWhat about ownership? What about control? What about damn regulation?!\u201d\nIf you stick around for the next part I promise you won\u2019t regret it. We\u2019ll discuss regulation, the role of recent developments in cryptocurrency and, finally, the real distribution of power that could be achieved when people sway\u00a0 from fiat-currency. I tip my hat to Daniel Jefferies, an actual inspiration to write something about this topic.\nWe now have a chance to make this world a better place with cryptocurrencies if we take this opportunity to learn how the shift could happen from valuing things to valuing knowledge. From the moment we all have (more or less) the same access to money and it becomes decentralized, why would we value possession and ownership the same way? If we all don\u2019t make an effort to at least try making the world a fairer place, don\u2019t sit around waiting for things to change, as i can almost guarantee that whoever is truly rich and powerful will come down like thunder on cryptocurrencies.\u00a0\nBecause why change what\u2019s already pretty good? Creating money through debt seems to work just fine.", "category": "Bitcoin Technology"}

They had titles like \u201cBitcoin Could Become Illegal Almost Everywhere, After Shocking Discovery in The Blockchain\u201c, \u201cBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) Story May Have Come To An End\u201d and even \u201cChild Abuse Content on Bitcoin Blockchain: Can Node Operators Be Prosecuted?\u201c. The basic premise of these articles is as follows:\n\nA research report \u201cA Quantitative Analysis of the Impact of Arbitrary Blockchain Content on Bitcoin\u201c, claims that there are 8 instances of blockchain encoded data which would be considered child porn in \u201cmany jurisdictions\u201d\nOut of these 8, \u201cfive files only show, describe, or link to mildly pornographic content\u201d, two of the other three contain lists of links (although there\u2019s\u00a0no evidence that any of these are still live). One contains an image depicting \u201cmild nudity of a young woman\u201d\nSomehow this makes anyone running a full Bitcoin node a criminal guilty of possession and distribution of child pornography\n\nThis claim just doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. First of all, the links themselves don\u2019t constitute child pornography. Second of all, the researchers have not cited any of their \u201cfindings\u201d on the blockchain meaning it\u2019s impossible to verify the validity of their claims. Third of all child pornography law is (perhaps unfortunately) far more nuanced than the authors of some of the aforementioned articles make it out to be.\nThis is an entirely computer-generated image and therefore does not legally constitute an \u201cactual person\u201d\nAlthough the paper mentions many jurisdictions, we\u2019ll use the United States as our example. It\u2019s probably the most well known to readers and also reflects the general sentiment of laws in different countries. U.S. law states that you must \u201cknowingly possesses any image that contains child pornography, and the image moved interstate commerce or was made by items that moved in interstate commerce\u201d.\nI think it\u2019s safe to say that all miners are unaware of any child pornography on the blockchain. I\u2019m personally doubtful anyone is aware of any child pornography on the blockchain (because I don\u2019t think there is any). Secondly, the courts have stipulated that the image must \u201cshow an actual minor child\u201d. This is tougher than it sounds to prove (see image on the left).\nComputer generated images aside, it\u2019s also tough to prove someone in an image is a child despite age. We all know Photoshop can do a lot\u00a0and these include making young looking 18 your olds look much younger. For this reason, about half the time, courts have to establish the identities of victims. This is becoming extremely hard as technology progresses and is another reason the articles above employed irresponsible reporting by claiming the blockchain contains child pornography.\nDespite the ludicrousness of some of the claims surrounding child pornography\u00a0on the blockchain, its immutability does cause other issues. Namely compliance with another law known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR is a regulation which aims to give users back control of there data. It also raises a few issues which are relevant to the blockchain.\nThe biggest of these is the right to be forgotten. Also known as data erasure, the GDPR website describes it as \u201cdata no longer being relevant to original purposes for processing,\u00a0or data subjects withdrawing consent\u201d. This means that EU citizens can file \u201cright to be forgotten requests\u201d and organizations must delete their data. This is a huge problem in blockchain applications. Let\u2019s take cryptograffiti.info for instance, which runs on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. CryptoGraffiti allows users to post images or text on the blockchain to be permanently stored. As an example for this story I wrote the following message:\n\u00a0\n\nSuddenly, I\u2019ve changed my mind and I would like to exercise my \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d. I can submit a request to cryptograffiti.info. They\u2019d be forced to comply, but that\u2019s not all. This data was written to the blockchain in this transaction. This means it now resides on every single bitcoin cash block explorer. I now have to submit requests to blockexplorer.com, bitcoin.com, blockdozer\u00a0and the list goes on. They all will also be forced to comply under GDPR rules. Then there are the miners.\nUnder GDPR, every miner is a \u201cdata processor\u201d who holds the data, meaning I can ask them to delete the data and under the law, as it\u2019s written now, they have to comply. One can quickly see this getting out of hand. Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash are publicly held blockchains, no one \u201cowns\u201d them so in theory, no one can be accountable for GDPR compliance. This is not the case for blockchains started by a corporation, which are in a legally ambiguous area.\nThese questions cause serious issues for any company looking to use blockchain in their tech stack. Can a company like Toyota really use BigChainDB\u00a0and remain compliant with GDPR. It\u2019s obvious moving forward that something has to give: blockchain applications cannot exist under the laws put forward by the EU.", "category": "Bitcoin Technology"}

Secretary of State Mac Warner has declared the launch of a secure military mobile voting solution for the upcoming May 8th primary election. This is a pilot project and will at first be restricted to two counties, namely Harrison County and Monongalia County. With this move deployed and enlisted military voters will have the ability to vote using the new system beginning Friday, March 23, 2018, until the point when polls are closed on primary election day on May 8, 2018. All that they need to cast their vote is a regular Apple or Android smartphone and approved State or Federal ID.\nThe objective of this venture is to offer a secure military mobile voting solution that is irrefutable, straightforward, and more secure and open than currently available mobile voting system. It will at first be constrained to military voters who are overseas to vote in Harrison and Monongalia counties. In any case, the state intends to extend the program to each of the 55 counties in the upcoming November general election if this pilot project proves fruitful.\nThis pilot venture is the first of its kind in the United States.\u00a0Warner said in a statement\u00a0\u201cWest Virginia is taking the lead in providing safe, secure and accurate voting systems to encourage voter participation at every level\u201d. The move likely comes amid renewed voting scrutiny over the 2016\u00a0presidential\u00a0election with Warner saying\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re working hard to increase the level of confidence citizens have in our election process. Increased confidence results in increased participation.\u201d\nThis safe military portable voting pilot venture is a joint effort between the Office of the Secretary of State of West Virginia, Voatz, Tusk/Montgomery Philanthropies, New America and the Blockchain Trust Accelerator. Voatz is the sole supplier planning the versatile voting stage. It is an award winning innovation startup situated in Boston MA. Its creative and exceptionally secure mobile voting stage has been utilized by more than 70,000 voters in different elections and voting occasions in numerous purviews including a few pilot ventures such as town meeting voting and participatory\u00a0budget voting. The Voatz app centers around providing cutting-edge security close by a simple to use\u00a0interface that empowers voters to make their voices heard in a free and open way.\nNo one\u2019s counting the program as a success yet. For the program to be utilized, military voters in the two counties need to apply for unique non-attendant status and download the protected application on an Apple or Android telephone or tablet.", "category": "Blockchain News"}

Despite periodic gains\u00a0this week, the market still finished down significantly from last week posting another double-digit\u00a0loss. This has been attributed to everything from child porn\u00a0to market manipulation\u00a0but the most compelling reason suggested so far has been the futures markets. In any case the bulls are still recommending everyone HODL on. Bitcoin cash is also down 30% this week despite BitPay\u2019s adoption of the technology.\nEthereum\u00a0is down 27% this week in yet another of a long series of price drops from it\u2019s high of almost $1,500. This follows the trend we\u2019ve seen over the past few weeks of correlated movements between the two currencies. Some\u00a0have pointed to this correlation\u00a0as a sign of an immature market.\nThe entire crypto market is down 20% this week\u00a0completely retracing the 10% increase\u00a0seen last week. These numbers are similar\u00a0to the 20% price drop\u00a0we saw 2 weeks ago. Despite all this, to some a huge recovery is imminent.\n\nBans & Warnings:\n\nKazakhstan\u2019s National Bank\u00a0may ban\u00a0cryptocurrencies. This follows a trend of countries opposing decentralized cryptocurrencies for fear of money laundering. Leading the charge was the Russians when Putin announced earlier this month that regulation\u00a0would be coming in March\u00a0and plans to launch its own currency.\nAnother warning by\u00a0Nigeria\u00a0was issued this week on the use of cryptocurrencies. Nigeria took a hard stance yet again warned\u00a0against cryptocurrencies. Their points are not entirely unfounded with a history\u00a0of Ponzi\u00a0schemes involving crypto in the region.\nDenmark blocked\u00a0trading\u00a0this week citing different concerns than those of Nigeria. The concerns of Denmark were focused on a lack of transparency around money laundering. They appear to have echoed the sentiments of the G20\u00a0summit last week and their concern is not unfounded.\nLawsuits over bans\u00a0were filed this week by The Russian Association of Crypto-Currency and Block-Finish (RACIB) and other industry associations after cryptocurrency advertising bans by several prominent companies. The group claims collusion amongst advertisers and calls the moves a \u201cspecial indignation at the crypto community\u201d. The lawsuit was filed against Google, Twitter, and Facebook. The move appears to be aimed more at deterrence\u00a0to stop other companies like MailChimp\u00a0from continuing to follow suit.\n\nOfficial Currencies:\n\nThe Bank of England is testing a blockchain system this week for real-time gross settlement\u00a0(bank to bank transfers). The bank, which is a centralized and government-owned\u00a0bank, is part of the bank\u2019s strategic plan for 2020. While just a proof of concept, its aim is to become \u201cmature enough\u201d for use with other banks.\nChina declared cryptocurrencies a top priority\u00a0for 2018. The central bank has created a science and technology team aimed at tackling the new technology which has already applied for 22 new patents. In an interview discussing the developments, a Chinese official talked about an official cryptocurrency while simultaneously bashing existing currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nOther news:\n\nMoney Laundering Arrests:\u00a0In the U.S. a drug dealer has been arrested again\u00a0for money laundering via digital currencies. This goes to show that the concerns repeatedly\u00a0brought up at the G20 summit were not unfounded. While money laundering charges are not uncommon this is one of the first cases to be charged under Arizona\u2019s new HB2417 law.\nReddit Disabled Bitcoin Payments\u00a0this week\u00a0among concerns around Coinbases ability to process payments. Coinbase has struggled recently and revamped its commerce platform. While not likely to have a large material impact on either company, Reddit was an early customer of Coinbase reporting processing $1 million in transactions a month\u00a0in 2013!\nMore Cryptojacking\u00a0has been reported using a vulnerability disclosed way back in 2013. While not the first, or biggest crypto jacking campaign, the miners have gotten away with nearly 320 Monero ($63,000) so far.\nThe U.S.Treasury further legitimized crypto\u00a0this week when it published a post\u00a0offering advice to Government agencies looking to use cryptocurrencies. The post recommends including skeptics on teams investigating blockchain saying that a team with \u201conly\u00a0pro-blockchain people can be blinded by the hype and force a square peg into a round hole\u201d. The note comes among criticism aimed at the CTFC chairman for discussing blockchain, as critics say that in doing so he might legitimize it.\nEthereum Infighting\u00a0was apparent this week as the community prepares to face off against ASIC miners. ASIC mining has been a touchy subject in the community, but this week a developer has opened an Ethereum Improvement Proposal to discuss measures aimed at stopping the controversial practice. With support from users,\u00a0the community is expected to take action in the coming weeks.\n", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The regulation of cryptocurrency was among the main topics debated by the multilateral group. The importance of everything that has been discussed in Argentina can impact the crypto market around the world. The main message was: We will not ban, but regulate the market. A very positive news was that there were many doubts about how the group including China, US, Japan, among others, would address the issue.\nCCN, in partnership with the Criptomoedas F\u00e1cil, summarized the main points that were discussed during the meetings. In July, the first concrete proposals for regulation should be presented, so it is important to follow the whole development of the theme that will bring institutional legitimacy to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, paving the way for major investors and institutional markets around the world.\n1. Cryptocurrency/blockchain should be adopted by the countries\nG20 participants have recognized that cryptocurrencies have the power to insert people who, today, are on the margins of the economic system. In addition, they realize that they can (and must, according to the Spanish finance minister) assist governments in broadening welfare policies.\n2. Nations recognize the demise of the traditional economy\nMinisters also agreed that the traditional economy is undergoing a transition process and that it is no longer possible to separate the digital age from the economy.\n3. Regulation is inevitable\nRegulation is an inevitable process, and although the economy is digital, citizens are real and are embedded in a country, as well as businesses, so rules need to be imposed, just as there is in other types of business.\n4. Regulate but not prohibit\nG20 members unanimously agreed that the cryptocurrencies are important and represent a revolution in the economy and social organization, so they can not be banned, but they have to go through a regulatory process.\n5. Regulation will not prevent technology breakthrough, but taxation is almost certain\nIt was also clear that the regulatory process will be handled very carefully so that hard rules are not imposed that hinder the development of technology. However, the application of fees, which can happen in different parts of the process, are practically certain.\n6. First regulatory proposals will be presented in July\nThe central bank presidents, the Financial Action Task Force (FAFT) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will be in charge of the G20 regulatory proposals. The first practical proposals for regulations will be presented in July this year during the 3rd meeting of finance ministers and central bank presidents.\n7. Preventing crimes\nThe regulatory proposals will mainly focus on preventing any illicit activity, such as financing terrorism, avoidance of currency, money laundering and also consumer protection, ie avoiding scams being applied through ICOs, cryptocurrency projects, among others.\n8. Tracking and KYC\nThere is still no consensus as to how or if crypto actives should be tracked or tagged so that it is possible to identify where they came from and where they are going. However, KYC and Digital Identity standards should be key points in the discussions.\n9. Europe wants to lead the process outside the G20\nEurope intends to lead the process of regulating cryptocurrencies, but will not wait for the G20\u2019s position until July. A group of countries on the continent have set up a working group to discuss the issue and implement practical norms for Europe before even the 20s present their proposals.\n10. Self-regulation\nAlthough the subject has not been addressed at official meetings, behind the scenes, the self-regulatory process that has been gaining ground in Japan, Puerto Rico and the US has been highly commented and may eventually gain room on the main agenda.", "category": "News"}

There is the ruble, and everything else is a surrogate.\u201d\nRussian president Vladimir Putin said\u00a0cryptocurrency regulation will be rolled out by July. While he has expressed concerns about cryptocurrencies because they\u2019re not backed by a central bank, the Russian government plans to launch its own digital currency called the CryptoRuble in a bid to circumvent U.S. economic sanctions.\nVladimir Putin wants to roll out a Russian cryptocurrency called the CryptoRuble.

While we see a continuous drop in the price of Bitcoin and altcoins in general, with most tokens trading even below their ICO prices, there has been no relenting in the amount of money raised during this period.\nThe end of February saw crowdfunding ventures raise over $1 Billion dollars for the third month running. Of the billions raised this year, $788 million has come from projects based in the U.S., $265 million from China, and $249 million from Lithuania. Switzerland, Europe\u2019s crowdsale heartland, is fourth with $249 million. The above figures reveal that there is a reasonable spread in the way these funds are raised, portraying a somewhat balanced ecosystem.\nDespite the political and institutional resistances faced by the cryptocurrency ecosystem, with specific attention paid to ICOs, this stable upward trend that is observed raises some curiosity. Questions about the fundamental indices behind the rising trend if ICO expansion abound as well as the sustainability of current behaviour of the industry.\nOverall Quality of ICOs\nThe Founder of LKI Consulting, a PR firm that has handled several ICOs especially in the last couple of months, Laura Kornelija Inamedinova believes that the reason for this ICO trend must be related to the increase in the overall quality of ICOs. She recalls the situation which existed in this industry around six months ago, where probably anyone could announce an ICO, as basically all what people needed was a nice and attractive idea and technological mindset or competence in business and digital innovations were considered as the second-tier subjects.\nInamedinova explains that time has shown that on the contrary, these aspects are the most important in order to have a successful ICO. Therefore, the increase in the number of high-quality and well-developed projects contributes to the growing confidence of investors.\nAlthough in general the ICO market has boomed and recorded impressive figures, there are a good number of projects that have not succeeded in achieving there set-out objective, hence are regarded as unsuccessful. Inamedinova identifies knowledge and communication as the major factors that determines how successful a project can be.\nInamedinova tells CCN:\n\u201cA successful ICO definitely requires the team which has an excellent knowledge in business and tech. On the other hand, communication is still a bit underrated, but it is as important as the understanding of particular industries. A good communication strategy always helps in displaying the best features of your project, as well as in attracting more people through creative campaigns. Also, the way that team members communicate with investors can tell a lot about the reliability of any ICO. The unsuccessful ones tend to be vague and even rude, what obviously indicates a quite flawed strategy.\u201d\nThe first major wave of announcing ICOs started in the summer of 2017. Regarding the nature of these projects, the first results will be visible in a year or two after the fundraising process, hence this could be between six to eighteen months from the time of writing. It will not be a surprise that most of the projects can fail (unfortunately, it is a pretty usual thing in the world of startups and innovations) and the mass disappointment will grow. However it turns out, interested people will not stop establishing new projects which will be significantly improved and definitely more successful. Eventually, blockchain technology will be expected to become massively applied not only in ICOs, but startups, corporations and even public sector would eventually adapt and widely use it due to safety and convenience.\nLooking Beyond the Figures\nCashaa founder Kumar Gaurav thinks that the industry should look beyond just the crowdfunding exercise carried out by a lot of projects at the moment in terms of ICO. Gaurav, whose company turned down over $14 million of the $33 million raised in an ICO due to compliance reasons identifies a lot of irregularities in the public perception of true substance of crowdfunding.\nOne trend identified by Gaurav is the recycling of investors and investments within the ecosystem which seems to bloat the industry beyond its true capacity. He notes that the practice by most investors is to sell older tokens, buy new ones, cash out the profit and move on to the next. This is possible because of the highly competitive market which is flooded by all kinds of project. The competition leads to high bonus promises, therefore even when the value seems to drop, the over-bloated bonuses sustains profit for investors. The question is for how long can such a system be sustained?\nAnother problem identified by Gaurav is that ICOs are attracting many investors from outside the industry who are only interested in their own profit and not necessarily in the technology or in supporting a particular company. Also, there are many beginners who are genuinely interested, but are only starting to learn and may be scared about market uncertainties, therefore are selling-off more easily. The current situation may create difficult situations in the long term for a company having raised funds via ICO and relying on both their raised Bitcoin and Ether, as well as their own token price going up.\nA Complex Setup\nThe above description reveals that a lot of ICO investors are merely speculators who may be in for just the short term. This makes it a bit complicated for project builders and developers in implementing their plans and objectives effectively. According to Gaurav, to get to this point in the first place, exactly the money coming from these more \u2018difficult\u2019 groups of people is needed to keep the amounts raised in ICOs high, as the investor landscape has become broad and only trying to raise from the original, long term involved groups of ICO investors coming from the blockchain industry is not enough.\nAt this point the question of what criteria is applied in determining the success of an ICO arises. It is common these days to classify an ICO as successful depending on the amount raised during the crowdfunding process as compared to achieving such by using traditional fundraising methods. However, when looking at their own definition of success, which was usually defined by the hard cap, until the majority of ICOs did not even reach two thirds of this number any more. Then, to prevent being seen as a failure, companies started to intentionally set lower goals. Hence, Gaurav explains that to decide what is a successful ICO, we also need to look at what happens to the company after a year and more.\n\u201cAlmost half of 2017`s ICOs have already disappeared, with some not having raised enough or having run away directly, but the majority having disappeared quietly, with a further group having stopped communicating and having a negligible community size and therefore a likely chance to fail. This amounts to an overall around 60 % of ICOs which actually need to be seen as a failure already\u201d, says Gaurav.\nHaving a Long-term Perspective\nSo instead of looking at impressive numbers, we may need to watch the long term activity such as product building and community engagement of the company to be able to judge whether it is a successful ICO or not.\nOne criteria is how long the company and if possible, their product, have been in existence, with the above mentioned one year already making a difference. In any case, especially if the company has existed less than a year, it is important that the team consists of people who are known, long-term involved in the industry, and have a successful track record.\nThe complexities that exist in the ICO ecosystem as already described may be considered as a normal occurrence in the developmental stages of any new innovation. However, in the coming years and once the hype is gone, as the different ways of fundraising have both their advantages and disadvantages, we may see a more stable industry and the amounts raised in ICOs will become close to, or even equivalent to the amounts raised on the traditional way, but with its own peculiar implementation benefits.", "category": "Blockchain News"}

Investors will be required to pay 7 percent in value-added tax (VAT) on all crypto trades alongside a 15% capital gains tax on returns, the Nikkei Asian Review reported.\nAs reported previously in mid-March, the Cabinet of Thailand \u2013 the government\u2019s executive branch \u2013 has already approved two royal decree drafts concerning the regulation of cryptocurrency transactions and enforcing taxes on crypto-related investments.

One particular upgrade, though, threatens to split the network into two competing chains.\nAs CCN reported, Monero earlier this year announced its intention to update its instance of the Cryptonight Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining algorithm at regular intervals to prevent mining hardware manufacturers from developing Monero-compatible ASIC miners, as critics allege that these devices lead to mining centralization and threaten the network\u2019s health.\nShortly after that announcement, Bitmain \u2014 the world\u2019s largest ASIC manufacturer \u2014 revealed that it had developed a Cryptonight ASIC, and Monero responded by including an emergency PoW adjustment in this week\u2019s planned hard fork.\nThe move appears to have broad community support, but at least one faction \u2014 a pseudonymous group operating under the name \u201cMonero Classic\u201d \u2014 says that it will continue to mine the original chain.\nFrom the group\u2019s website:\n\u201cAround 80% of the current Monero hash rate agrees with our stance and refuses to follow the POW change. That is why we declare in advance that we will maintain the original software which follows the original rules. We reject centralised developer Control and we believe that\u2019s voluntary participation for both users and miners Will uphold the principles of decentralisation.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the group is truly pro-ASIC or is merely using the fork as an opportunity to turn a quick profit by creating a new cryptocurrency, but it\u2019s notable that AntPool \u2014 which is operated by Bitmain \u2014 has opened a Monero Classic mining pool and has encouraged users to claim XMC.\n\n\u3010Announcement for Monero Mining Pool Online & Fork on April 6th\u3011In order to respect miners\u2019 selection and actual demand, and reduce the mining threshold of Monero, #AntPool is working on #Monero mining pool development and optimization.https://t.co/PD9MNxfzvS pic.twitter.com/3u0WabHhZ5\n\u2014 AntPool (@AntPoolofficial) April 4, 2018\n\nIn any case, that 80 percent figure cited on the Monero Classic website is, of course, misleading. Users are always slow to upgrade to new software versions, so failure to upgrade in a timely manner does not necessarily mean a miner rejects the PoW change.\nAdditionally, an unknown percentage of the hashrate belongs to ASIC miners \u2014 the very devices the fork renders obsolete. Of course they will continue to mine the original chain \u2014 they have no other choice aside from directing their hashpower at another Cryptonight coin.\nFinally, it\u2019s no secret that Monero is mined by a number of botnets, and while seasoned hackers will deploy updated payloads to their zombie computers, \u201cscript kiddies\u201d won\u2019t have the tools to do this and their botnets will continue to mine Monero Classic in perpetuity.\nRegardless of which chain they choose to follow, Monero\u2019s developers have warned that spending coins on both chains could have adverse effects on user privacy \u2014 even for users who only interact with a single network.", "category": "Altcoin Mining"}

Traders were anticipating a potential drop to the yearly bottom at $6,000, as bitcoin price remained at the $6,000 mark for several hours before rebounding to $6,600. If the bitcoin price had not rebounded from that level and sustained the $6,500 mark, the price of bitcoin could have dropped to the $6,000 mark.\nHowever, as time passed, bitcoin started to demonstrate some buy volumes, and it picked up momentum on April 7. Eventually, within a 24-hour span, the bitcoin price increased from $6,500 to $6,950.\nThe 15-minute candle chart of bitcoin on April 6 evidently showed the end of its corrective rally from $6,600 to $7,500, which could have been key to bitcoin\u2019s short-term recovery towards the $8,000 region. In the upcoming days, bitcoin could eye the $8,000 region if it can rise back again to $7,500 and test the $7,800 level. \n\nThroughout today, bitcoin has shown some signs of recovery, and if this rally takes bitcoin to the $7,000 region, it is likely that bitcoin could eye the $7,500 mark, as it had earlier this week.\nGenerally, the market has also become optimistic towards the entrance of institutional investors in the cryptocurrency space. In December, investors expected a wave of retail traders to enter the bitcoin sector through the bitcoin futures market. But, volumes on the bitcoin futures market have been virtually non-existent, and the demand from institutional investors from the west has been a disappointment.\nThis week, George Soros and Soros Fund, a fund founded by the legendary $8 billion investor, announced that it is preparing to trade cryptocurrencies, as Bloomberg reported. Over the past three months, several large hedge funds like Fortress have exited the space. If new capital comes into the market in an extremely volatile period like this, it could help bitcoin to recover from its previous losses.\n\u201cAdam Fisher, who oversees macro investing at New York-based Soros Fund Management, got internal approval to trade virtual coins in the last few months, though he has yet to make a wager, according to people familiar with the matter. A spokesman declined to comment,\u201d read Bloomberg\u2019s report.\nOntology\nSince April 4, Ontology has been the best performing alternative cryptocurrency against bitcoin. WIthin a three day span, the value of Ontology has nearly doubled against bitcoin on Binance, the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchange. Several altcoins such as ICON have also performed well against bitcoin, leading to excitement within the cryptocurrency space.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

The company outlined the approach that each of its businesses will take to support Bitcoin Forks.\n\nCoinbase Custody \u2013 It will develop infrastructure to support Bitcoin Forks. The company said that Coinbase Custody will likely support a greater number of forked assets versus its GDAX or Coinbase platforms.\nGDAX will similarly develop the infrastructure to support Bitcoin Forks for assets that are kept on this platform when the fork occurs.

The tax bill is taking a bit longer to make its way through the Legislature, but it could be a model for other states to adopt if it passes.\nThe state is looking to fintech more broadly to bolster the economy, as evidenced by the fintech regulatory sandbox that became a reality last month.

Bitcoin prices are prone to wild, unexpected swings. After scoring an all-time high of $19,000 in December 2017, BTC prices have tanked below $7,000 this week.

Since that time the value of bitcoin has skyrocketed and customers holding bitcoin have considerably more purchasing power. We believe the time is right to broaden our acceptance of bitcoin to our customers in Canada,\u201d added Lee.\nStephen Pair, the CEO at BitPay, a cryptocurrency payment processor that is responsible for handling bitcoin payments made to Newegg, also stated that the demand for cryptocurrencies from users in Canada has increased over the past few years, and Newegg\u2019s integration of bitcoin would allow the adoption rate of bitcoin to grow throughout the country.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of traction in Canada, and we\u2019re happy to see Newegg extend its bitcoin payment option north of the border,\u201d said Pair.\nOther than Newegg, e-commerce platform Overstock, one of the world\u2019s largest travel booking agency Expedia, eGifter, Gyft, satellite television service provider Dish, and CheapAir also accept bitcoin as a payment method.\nFactors of Growth\nIn January, prior to the major correction of bitcoin, Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz stated that the organization is willing to integrate a cryptocurrency in the future if it is retailer friendly and it is able to handle a certain capacity of transactions that is sufficient for large-scale conglomerates.\nDuring a conference call, Schultz stated that he personally does not believe bitcoin would be the global currency that will be adopted by retailers, but a cryptocurrency could be used in the future by retailers.\n\u201cI personally believe that there is going to be a one or a few legitimate trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology. And that legitimacy and trust in terms of its consumer application will have to be legitimized by a brand and a brick and mortar environment, where the consumer has trust and confidence in the company that is providing the transaction,\u201d said Schultz.\nAs Visa executive and Bitcoin Foundation co-founder Jon Matonis previously emphasized, the legitimacy of bitcoin as a global currency could continue to increase as major banks like Goldman Sachs and retailers like Newegg continue to adopt bitcoin as a payment method and a currency.\nCurrently, the extreme volatility of the market makes it dififcult for retailers to fully adopt cryptocurrencies as a payment method. But, as the market grows and matures with public investment vehicles and more regulated investment channels, bitcoin could evolve into a global digital currency that is widely adopted by retailers.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fabulous that they\u2019re getting into it because it brings in new liquidity. They\u2019re going to develop futures markets, options markets, I even think you\u2019re going to start to see interest rate markets around bitcoin.

The cryptocurrency market is continuing its move towards the $300 billion region, after dipping below $243 billion last week.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Slight Drop\nSince March 31, the cryptocurrency market has been able to lead a short-term recovery, bouncing back from the $6,500 region. But, yesterday, CCN reported that bitcoin will experience a slight decline in value from the $7,400 mark before it leads another strong rally.\nOver the past 24 hours, bitcoin has declined by more than $400 from $7,500 to $7,100. At one point, the price of bitcoin dipped below $7,000, but recovered to $7,100 since then.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, is currently at 37.1, which signifies a neutral zone for bitcoin. If the RSI of bitcoin continues to decline to 30, it would mean that traders have oversold the cryptocurrency. Other momentum indicators such as moving average convergence divergence (MACD) also show a neutral zone for bitcoin, and a lack of momentum for a strong short-term performance.\nGiven that momentum indicators point toward a neutral zone for bitcoin and moving averages indicate a strong sell signal, it is likely that bitcoin could dip below the $7,000 mark once again before it continues its mid-term recovery.\nWhile technical analysis and momentum indicators point toward a weak short-term trend for bitcoin, fundamentals remain significantly strong. Earlier this week, Augur co-founder Jeremy Gardner stated that the demand towards bitcoin from investors in the over-the-counter (OTC) has spiked substantially over the past few months, as the price of bitcoin rapidly declined.\nLow prices of cryptocurrencies are starting to appeal to retail traders and large-scale investors, which could potentially lead to multi-billion dollar bids. In bitcoin, over-the-counter (OTC) markets often refer to direct miner-to-investor trades or brokerage-to-investor trades, or generally traders which are processed outside of the global cryptocurrency exchange market.\nGardner wrote:\n\u201cOTC market demand for bitcoin right now is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever witnessed. Several asks for multi-billion dollar bids.\u201d\nIt is entirely likely that hedge funds and large-scale investors are seeking for opportunities to invest in the cryptocurrency market when most major cryptocurrencies are still significantly down from their all-time high values.\nShort-Term Trend\nThe minor drop in the price of bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies led to a slight decline in the valuation of the cryptocurrency market, and investors would not have to worry about another correction emerging in the short-term unless bitcoin drops back to the $6,000 region, which seems likely unlikely that this stage.\nIn consideration of the increasing demand towards bitcoin from over-the-counter markets, large-scale investors, and hedge funds, and the hesitancy of traders to sell the most dominant cryptocurrency at current levels, it is likely that the price of bitcoin will rebound in the upcoming days.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

The price was largely sideways this week retesting $7,000\u00a0and $7,350\u00a0before coming back down to $6,980 and failing to hold the $7,000 level. The price was as low $6,500 this week. as Despite this sideways movement, Bitcoins dominance has been steadily climbing from it\u2019s low in January. Analysts are optimistic citing the end of tax season in the US and increasing institutional adoption.\nEthereum is up 3% this week after several weeks of double-digit drops from it\u2019s high of almost $1,500. The currency has been consistently sideways despite its increased adoption. Ethereum has continued its trend of closely correlated movements with Bitcoin that was discussed last week.\nThe entire crypto market stayed flat this week\u00a0despite hitting a high of $280 billion this week and dropping below $250 billion. The bulls have pointed to this as a breakout consolidation pattern.\n\nExchanges and Payments:\n\nCoinbase has announced it will\u00a0support the withdrawal of Bitcoin Forks this week. While the most prominent of the forks, Bitcoin Cash, has been fully supported for months, the exchange plans to add other forks such as Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond. While the company made it clear that these coins will not (yet) be tradable this opens up the possibility in the future. This comes after an announcement of its intention to support ERC20 Tokens\u00a0in some of its subsidiaries.\nCoinbase also announced the creation of Coinbase Ventures, a new venture capital fund. The fund will start with $15 million and will continue to grow. Coinbase has made it very clear\u00a0that the fund will invest exclusively in companies behind crypto assets and not crypto assets themselves.

This comes in stark contrast to\u00a0Kookmin, Korea\u2019s largest bank which has repeatedly denied financial services to cryptocurrency startups after coming under regulatory scrutiny\u00a0earlier this year. The announcement comes in the same week that a dozen people were arrested in the country in connection with an illegal mining operation.\nRobinhood launched commission\u00a0free crypto trading this week. While the launch is limited to just four states and restricted to Bitcoin and Ethereum the launch is part of a much broader \u201cgradual rollout\u201d.

So much so, it allegedly helped double the number of interested investors.\nAs covered by CCN, US President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning US citizens from buying, trading, or dealing in cryptocurrencies related to the Venezuelan government \u2013 the Petro, and potentially the Petro Gold.\nIn his interview, Pe\u00f1a revealed he sees cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as \u201cimportant steps in humanity\u2019s revolution.\u201d He claimed he knows Venezuela is going in the right direction with the Petro, as Donald Trump took the time to issue an executive order on it. When asked how Trump\u2019s words affected the oil-backed cryptocurrency, he stated (roughly translated):\n\u201cI answer you like Earle Herrera [a Venezuelan journalist] when he said that I do not know anything about cryptocurrency, nor do I have clarity about the evolution of the digital currency; But if US President Donald Trump gives it time, imagine that. A person so busy giving it his time, that means we\u2019re on the right path.\u201d\nPe\u00f1a further claimed the country\u2019s government had been preparing for a \u201cUS\u201d attack on the Petro. Trump\u2019s move, he said, didn\u2019t affect the Petro, but instead served as a \u201cboomerang for the US government,\u201d as it \u201caroused more interest in acquiring the Petro in the world.\u201d\nHe touted that he\u2019s been seeing rising interest in Africa, and that Trump\u2019s executive order was free publicity. As such, he claimed there\u2019s an ever-growing amount of investors looking to buy Petros \u2013 even in the US.\nThe executive secretary noted that before Trump\u2019s words the Petro had \u201cmore or less 400 clients\u201d per day, and that after the president\u2019s words the number jumped to 800. Petro\u2019s sale, he said, will last until every single token has been bought.\nThe interviewer then asked Pe\u00f1a when could Venezuela expect to see its economy improve. He replied:\n\u201cPetro\u2019s impact will be felt within three to six months. We have already advanced fast. As the gringos know that we are going to quickly reorganize our economy, they attack the Bolivarian Government; but they will not stop the economy\u2019s growth, they know it.\nAs covered by CCN, the century-old think tank Brookings Institute has claimed Venezuela\u2019s Petro undermines legitimate cryptocurrencies, and won\u2019t stabilize Venezuela\u2019s economy. Moreover, the think tank claimed it\u2019s unclear what use the oil-backed cryptocurrency has for foreign investors.\nVenezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, last month, claimed the Petro\u2019s pre-sale raked in $5 billion. These numbers, according to currently available information, don\u2019t add up if we take into account a total of 38.4 million tokens were being sold at $60 each. This means Maduro may have falsified these numbers.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate, reportedly declared his opposition to the ban in a meeting with other high-ranking officials.\n\u201cNobody is opposed to breaking Telegram\u2019s monopoly [in Iran], but blocking Telegram is not the solution for creating [and enhancing] local messaging applications,\u201d he reportedly said.\nNotably, Iran is also reportedly researching blockchain technology and considering launching its own state-backed digital currency, a move it believes could help it evade international economic sanctions.

Questions pertain to their usage in the real world in areas like payments and remittances, their profitability as an asset and more.\nOne question is a notable standout, posing the query: \u201cShouldn\u2019t it be better to\u00a0ban something we don\u2019t understand?\u201d. To this, Kuramoto is quick to claim that cryptocurrencies have not yet me the objectives for which they were created in the first place \u2013 \u2018cheaper remittance\u2019 and to \u2018support socially significant activities.\u2019 However, the official added that cryptocurrencies, when matured sufficiently in the future, could usher in a new mechanism that could dramatically convenience people\u2019s lives in society.\nThe central bank official notably added:\nTo that end, it is important to actually try it in the world. There is reason to believe that [its maturity] will allow us to use existing cryptocurrencies, accumulate use cases and promote further technical development.\nEncouraging words aside, the central banker dismissed the notion that cryptocurrencies could be compared to fiat money like the yen or the dollar by claiming the latter are backed by central banks while cryptos do\u00a0not see any issuer like a \u2018central bank, corporation or a financial institution\u2019 and therefore, according to him, lacks a user\u2019s trust.\nKuramoto\u00a0also pointed to the infamous January heist of Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck where NEM tokens worth $530 million, at the time, were stolen. Kuramoto blamed Coincheck for fielding \u2018insufficient\u2019 fraud prevention safeguards while stressing that an investigation into the exchange and others are currently underway.\n\u201c[S]ince Japan is known worldwide as a country where virtual currency trading is popular, there is the possibility that bad guys around the world will look at the virtual currency traded in Japan and get various skills,\u201d the official added, reminding investors and adopters to be wary of risks.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

But what really bothered Buterin was Wright\u2019s claim regarding \u201cselfish miner\u201d theory. Wright had apparently said that \u201cin the context of selfish mining, gamma can be less than zero.\u201d\n\nButerin took the floor, stating:\nIt\u2019s an absolutely nonsensical claim. It makes no sense because gamma is the percentage of the network which is colluding with the miners, which, by definition, is between 0 and 1. So given that he makes so many nonsensical mistakes, why is he \u2013 why is this fraud allowed to speak at this conference?\nSamson Mow, CSO at Blockstream, quickly seconded the question to audible applause and laughter.\nWright Rebuttal\nSelfish mining is an attack vector of Bitcoin. Wright clarified that his meaning was that \u201chonest miners\u201d would be rewarded as opposed to selfish miners. Wright has written on the subject previously, saying:\nAgain, and again we see technocrats, academics and demagogues oversimplifying, downplaying profit and seeking to apply the physics of rocks to human interactions. Unfortunately for them, none of these holds in the real world. Human interactions are always conducted at a level far too complex to be modelled using simple state tables. That aside, flawed pseudoscience such as the selfish mining cancer are incredibly simple to debunk. Once you get past the ad hominem attacks and typical troll tactics, even my grandmother can understand how asinine such a quack level theory really is.\nIn the fray, Joseph Poon, co-creator of the Lightning Network, stood up to say that as a Lightning Network developer and the author of its whitepaper, he did not understand Wright\u2019s presentation at all and that he felt most others there were in the same boat.\nThe real world episode ended when the emcee called a stop to it, but, of course, it continued on Twitter.\n\nSmackdown by Vitalek\u2026.\nOh\u2026 where are my degrees\u2026.. it burns, it burns\u2026https://t.co/hqK9svIZE3\nSorry Bevis\u2026 Oh I mean Vitalek pic.twitter.com/efFeat4kp4\n\u2014 Dr Craig S Wright (@ProfFaustus) April 3, 2018\n\nInto the late night Buterin wrote a 62-tweet article discussing the great Bitcoin Scaling debate, and concluded with the following:\n\n62.

Gox CEO Mark Karpeles has a simple message for creditors of the disgraced, now-defunct Bitcoin exchange: I\u2019m on your side.\nKarpeles, who oversaw the Tokyo-based exchange during its infamous collapse in 2014, reiterated this claim in a Reddit AMA on Wednesday, alleging that he does not want to profit from the company\u2019s bankruptcy, which is currently proceeding through the Japanese courts.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this. I don\u2019t want this billion dollars.

Gox to be moved into civil rehabilitation, which would give creditors the ability to vote on the exchange\u2019s future. Consequently, they could vote to distribute the company\u2019s remaining BTC \u2014 as well as the coins derived from its forks \u2014 directly to creditors rather than selling them and paying the proceeds in fiat currency.\n\u201cI am doing my best to make it happen,\u201d he said.\nLast month, the trustee of the Mt.

But today we learn the lengths that Ripple, the No. 3 digital coin by market cap, would go to get its XRP coin listed on the leading trading platforms alongside bitcoin and Ethereum.\nAccording to a report in Bloomberg, the cross-border payments startup\u00a0is willing to pay millions to get XRP listed on the US trading platforms where there\u2019s the most liquidity.\u00a0The report says that Ripple offered \u201cfinancial incentives\u201d to bitcoin exchanges Gemini of Winklevoss twins fame as well as Coinbase in exchange for a listing. It\u2019s standard procedure to pay for a listing in the equities markets, but not necessarily the loosely unregulated cryptocurrency markets.\nRipple reportedly offered $1 million cash money to Gemini for a Q3 2017 listing and proposed a loan of $100 million in XRP to Coinbase with which investors could trade on the exchange. The report suggests that Ripple would have taken repayment either in fiat money or XRP, which would have given the US-based exchange an opportunity to profit from the deal.\nA Ripple spokesperson denied some of the details, though which ones are unclear, telling Bloomberg: \u201cWe want XRP to be the most liquid digital asset possible to enable faster, cheaper global payments.\u201d\nBut market participants worry that when US policymakers clarify the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, XRP will fall in the securities camp.\u00a0Meanwhile, the greater the speculation that more leading exchanges will support XRP, the more the digital coin\u2019s price has benefited, such as at year-end 2017 and last month, for instance.\nCourtesy: Coin Market Cap\nGray Area\nIt\u2019s not that traders don\u2019t want XRP, as they have been demanding it on forums and in social media.

That many exchanges allow promoters to pay to have their tokens listed has been an open secret almost since the industry\u2019s inception.\nNor is it surprising that this practice has become commonplace, given that most new cryptocurrency launches come in the form of ICOs and token sale operators are expected to use a portion of the funds they raise to promote their token.\nHowever, the fees that projects are paying to achieve an exchange listing are notable, as they are roughly significantly higher than the fees traditional companies pay when conducting an initial public offering (IPO) and listing their tokens on a traditional equities exchange.\nNasdaq-listed companies, for instance, can expect to pay approximately $125,000 to $300,000 to get listed, though they also have to pay annual maintenance fees to secure their status on the platform.\nPerhaps ICO operators find the exchange listing fee more palatable upon the realization that some promoters are paying $105,000 for a single tweet.\nMoreover, in the case of an ICO \u2014 particularly one claiming to be a utility token \u2014 paying an exchange to fast-track a token\u2019s listing raises a thorny regulatory question.\nPaying an exchange to list your token is more or less creating a secondary market, which is a factor that regulatory agencies such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) consider when determining whether a token is a security. And that\u2019s not just a problem for ICO operators \u2014 the SEC has also warned exchanges that it is illegal for them to list security tokens without registering as securities exchanges.", "category": "Exchanges"}

Even though the electricity bill is included under room and board, giving today\u2019s college kids a key advantage in the bitcoin mining process, the persistently low cryptocurrency prices of late have been eating into their profit margins.\nMeanwhile, soaring demand for\u00a0computer graphic processing units (GPUs), which are also used in the gaming industry, has\u00a0put a premium on the\u00a0hardware needed to produce more\u00a0cryptocurrencies and left gamers and miners alike scrambling for graphic cards. As Forbes pointed out, if you can get your hands on one, a Nvidia GTX 1070 will run you between $699 and $850, which is a steep price for most college kids to pay.\nA Fairleigh Dickenson University (FDU) senior who has been mining BTC for the past six years since the bitcoin price was trading in the single digits told CNBC: \u201cIt\u2019s gotten pretty ludicrous now the amount of money you have to spend to get in.\u201d This student, whose first name is Alex, invested thousands of dollars into his bitcoin mining operation\u00a0and till now found a way to\u00a0keep his\u00a0business off the\u00a0radar of the radar of the\u00a0university by carefully positioning GPUs to avoid a power outage.\nAt first, he said, cryptocurrency mining \u201cwasn\u2019t really the electricity sapping phenomenon it is today.\u201d But these days, his\u00a0bitcoin mining business operates around the clock between\u00a0his dorm room and back home, which has netted him anywhere from a $200 to $1,000 every eight weeks or so and which he directs toward books, etc.\nNot all student bitcoin miners run their\u00a0equipment on campus, however. A Northwest Missouri State University student who has mined different cryptocurrencies over the past few years said cryptocurrency mining commands more than a student\u2019s \u2018fair share\u2019 of power: \u201cIt is immoral to use [campus power] to mine\u201d and \u201cmost mining equipment uses no less than one kilowatt per hour of power,\u201d the student said.\nMeanwhile, a second student at FDU built his computer operation with gaming in mind but couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity in cryptocurrency mining at year-end 2017 when the bitcoin price was trading more than double where it is today. He used NiceHash to mine cryptocurrencies, but it wasn\u2019t worthwhile, with this student mining a mere .00027 BTC daily.\nFeeding the Beast\nBitcoin\u00a0mining involves solving complicated equations known as proof-of-work to advance the blockchain in exchange for a bonus. But the more transactions and blocks that are completed, the more complex the puzzles become to solve, which only feeds the beast by ramping up power consumption to mine more bitcoin, Monero, etc.\nCryptocurrency mining appears to fall under a gray area for today\u2019s FDU students, but that could change.\n\u201cFDU also blocks the mining of cryptocurrency at the firewall level and will probably add some specific language prohibiting mining cryptocurrency to the next version of the Acceptable Use Policy,\u201d according to FDU cited in CNBC.\nIf universities decide to clamp down on their bitcoin mining policies, college students could lose a key advantage once cryptocurrency prices rebound.", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

While several big buy volumes were recorded on major exchanges like Bitfinex and Bithumb, the market struggled to sustain the momentum it has created over the past 5 days from March 31 to April 4. \nThe relative strength index (RSI), a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, indicates that the market has oversold bitcoin in the past 24 hours, given that the RSI of bitcoin is moving closer to the 34.6. The low RSI of bitcoin and Williams Percent Range, which also determines the momentum of the market, evidently show that the market has oversold bitcoin at current levels.\n\nPossible Factors\nAs it is almost always the case, no particular factors contributed to the decline in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies simply saw a decline in demand from the market, as other cryptocurrencies with the exception of a handful of small alternative cryptocurrencies also recorded large losses.\nPotential factors that could have contributed to the decline in the price of bitcoin over the past four months, from December to April, could be the massive sell-off of bitcoin by two large organizations: Fortress and the Mt.Gox trustee.\nAccording to cryptocurrency researcher Matt Odell and a report released by FT, Fortress sold over $200 million worth of bitcoin throughout the first quarter of 2018, while the Mt. Gox trustee also dumped $362 million worth of the cryptocurrency into the market. The two organizations have sold more than half a billion worth of bitcoin in a short period of time on public cryptocurrency exchanges.\nIf Fortress and Mt. Gox sold their holdings of bitcoin in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, it could have minimized the impact of the massive sell-off on the market. But, their use of cryptocurrency trading platforms with limited liquidity to sell the most dominant cryptocurrency in the market led to a domino effect across all exchanges, explaining the correlated movements in the market. \n\u201cAfter the SoftBank deal was announced, Fortress agreed to sell Logan Circle Partners, its fixed-income money management arm, to MetLife in a $250m deal. Two people with knowledge of Fortress\u2019s dealing said the private equity group had also liquidated about $200m worth of bitcoin it had held in the past few months,\u201d Arash Massoudi of FT reported.\nEthereum and ICOs\nEthereum has more or less followed the overall trend of bitcoin over the past few months, similar to other major cryptocurrencies. But, this week, the Japanese government announced its decision to legalize ICOs and provide a channel for investors to fund blockchain projects again through token sales.\nThe Japanese government\u2019s open stance towards Ethereum and the ICO market could lead to a rise in the value of tokens in the short-term.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

By the end of February, amidst tightening regulation in India, the relative interest in Ethereum had risen to twice that of Bitcoin.\nCryptocurrencies have enjoyed immense popularity in India over the past year, at times Bitcoin was trading at a 30% premium. The reason can be traced back to 2016, when the Reserve Bank of India removed high-value bills from circulation in a move that shocked the nation. It underlined the value of a currency that isn\u2019t controlled by a central authority \u2013 the principal that defined the creation of Bitcoin over 10 years ago.\nHowever, the shine has come off the popularity of cryptocurrency in India. Following announcements from other central banks including the UK\u00a0and the US, India\u2019s central bank has been applying regulatory pressures on its national banks and local cryptocurrency exchanges. As a result, it has been reported that trading volumes on India\u2019s popular bitcoin trading platforms have plummeted by 90%.\nThis fall in trading volumes could indicate that traders in India are simply moving away from centralized trading platforms. The strength of cryptocurrencies are that they can be exchanged peer to peer. According to analysis by CryptoCompare, two-thirds of Indian Rupee transactions now take place on LocalBitcoins\u00a0\u2013 a person to person bitcoin trading site that doesn\u2019t rely on a centralized exchange in order to convert into fiat.\nIncreased interest in Ethereum reflects a general trend towards diversifying crypto-assets, it is the currency of choice for investing in Initial Coin Offerings. In a tough market, traders have been looking to these crypto-startups to find returns.\nAccording to Sathvik Vishwanath, co-founder and CEO of Unocoin, an Indian bitcoin exchange and as reported by Quartz, \u201cThe market is very, very dull,\u201d as regulation and tax is weighing on people\u2019s minds.\nPerhaps the interest in Ethereum discovered by Jana simply reflects Sathvik\u2019s sentiments. The market has endured a difficult few months, Ethereum\u2019s promise of decentralized apps and its ERC-20 based-ICOs offer the Indian market a glimmer of excitement and a more positive future in a bearish market.", "category": "Ethereum News"}

The notice read (roughly translated):\n\u201cWe hereby inform you that BancoEstado has decided to close the account of which you are the owner, in accordance with the power provided in the Accounts Contract.\u201d\nThis is a notable move, as CCN recently reported\u00a0that Chilean cryptocurrency exchanges BUDA and Crypto MKT saw banks shutter their accounts. In response, the exchanges issued a public statement calling on the country\u2019s banking association, ABIF, to clarify its stance on the cryptocurrency industry.\nAt the time, the exchanges noted one of the banks revealed it had instructions to \u201cnot open an account for anyone that has relation to cryptocurrencies.\u201d BancoEstado was the only financial institution still working with the exchanges.\nCryptocurrency exchanges react\nIn response, BUDA CEO Pablo Chavez stated that if BancoEstado goes through with the move, the company will have to \u201cmove to a different format, the most extreme option would be to open a digital bank that allows operation.\u201d\nMartin Jofr\u00e9, Crypto MKT\u2019s co-founder, stated that if BancoEstado turns its back on the caompy, the exchange would be left with no banking. If it comes to that, he emphasized, the company would return users their funds.\nOrionx, knowing BancoEstado is shuttering its account, also ensured users their funds are \u201cfully backed and there is no risk of insolvency.\u201d Reacting to the financial institution\u2019s move, Orionx sated it doesn\u2019t agree with it, and believes \u201cit is an incorrect and anti-competitive measure.\u201d\nIn their joint statement, BUDA and Crypto MKT both argued they pay value-added tax (VAT), are registered with the Chilean Financial Analysis Unit (UAF), and follow anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing practices, while providing its users a safe platform.\nABIF, the organization the cryptocurrency exchanges addressed in their statement, has since responded and claimed it isn\u2019t responsible for solving the problem, as this is \u201ca matter that must be addressed and resolved in the context of the individual relationship of each bank with its customers.\u201d", "category": "Banking"}

The new game, called KittyRace, sees the digital cats race against each other for an Ethereum prize.\nKittyRace essentially allows digital cat hodlers to enter their pets in a race against others\u2019 pets, for an entry fee. As with CryptoKitties, specific traits help cats win races, combined with their entry timing and an element of chance. The winner receives everyone\u2019s entry fees, minus a small portion used to pay for the transaction.\nNotably the game was created by a firm called Endless Nameless, and is run by Charley Hine and Eugene Otto. Endless Nameless has nothing to do with Axiom Zen, the firm that brought CryptoKitties to life. Thanks to a lack of property rights on a decentralized blockchain-based game, KittyRace\u2019s developers were able to give digital cat owners new ways to have fun.\nTo play the game, users need to head on over to KittyRace\u2019s website, and have an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask installed. Although the game hasn\u2019t helped anyone make fortunes \u2013 unlike CryptoKitties \u2013 it\u2019s currently seeing an increasing number of players work on breeding potential race-winning cats.\nOn Reddit, some users claim the game has been \u201csolved,\u201d as digital cats with the right attributes just keep taking the prize, making the game a waste of money for those with not so desirable cats. Other users, on Telegram, asked the developers not to change the game\u2019s formula.\nIf we take away the cat puns and cute graphics, the app resembles a decentralized, feline version of a casino game. The legalities of the game are murky at best, and as such the developers aren\u2019t monetizing it. They are, however, bullish on what it represents.\nAccording to Quartz, Hine stated:\n\u201cA betting game between strangers on the internet without a centralized party in the flow of funds wasn\u2019t really possible before ethereum\u2014it\u2019s uncharted territory.\u201d\nHine added that his firm will wait for clearer rules before they started trying to make money off of the game. This, as Quartz implied, may mean CryptoKitty owners don\u2019t have to fear their cats\u2019 value will dilute over time, as the cats are essentially blockchain-based tokens that can be used in other apps.\nThis, as developers like Hine can launch new games without dealing with any bureaucracy. In fact, a new game called KittyHats has been developed by a firm dubbed Salina Labs. It lets CryptoKitty owners adorn their digital pets with headgear, pieces of art, and shoes.\nCryptoKitties itself, as covered by CCN, raised $12 million in a Series A funding round last month. The funding round was led by venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures (USV), and included personal investments from major tech figures.", "category": "Ethereum News"}

After shedding $119 billion-plus from its market cap in Q1 amid pressure from regulators and the cold shoulder from advertising platforms, the bitcoin price is ready for a rebound. And it appears the stars are beginning to align for that to happen in the second quarter. CNBC\u2019s Brian Kelly outlined the drivers of the bitcoin price for the new quarter, and we\u2019ve added to them.\n\nUS Tax Season\u2019s Nearly Over\n\nApril 15 marks the end of tax season in the United States, and it\u2019s just around the corner. Investors who profited from bitcoin\u2019s massive rally in December are having to come up with the money to pay Uncle Sam now, which could explain a percentage of the selling pressure in the\u00a0bitcoin price in March. Kelly noted that any \u201ctax-related selling\u201d that\u2019s been happening in March is going to come to an end in a little more than a week. (Separately, Kelly also noted that the blockbuster $2 billion Telegram ICO may have attracted investments away from BTC.)\n\nCoincheck Deal in Sight\n\nAs CCN previously reported, Japan\u2019s Coincheck may be on the block. Not only is it for sale but the potential buyer, online brokerage Monex Group, is the parent company of US-based TradeStation (with massive data and charting capabilities) and is publicly traded.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massive confidence boost; you now have a regulated public company in Japan buying into a crypto exchange,\u201d Brian Kelly, CEO of BK Capital Management, told CNBC.\nKelly added that\u00a0 \u201cmassive, massive sentiment shift.\u201d\n\nHistory Is on Bitcoin\u2019s Side\n\nUnless you were looking to buy the dip, March was difficult to watch for bitcoin investors. But even though the bitcoin price suffered, the performance only proves that history repeats itself. March is historically a dismal month for the leading cryptocurrency, \u201crising only one of the last seven years [in 2013],\u201d as per Fundstrat data.\nThat\u2019s good news for April because historically, this is one of the best trading months for the bitcoin price, \u201crising five of the last seven years,\u201d Fundstrat says.\nOther Tailwinds\nThe forces for bitcoin are stronger than the forces against it. While these three drivers of the bitcoin price appear imminent, there could be others. For instance, major bitcoin markets around the world including the United States are awaiting a regulatory framework to take shape to take the uncertainty out of the equation, among other reasons. It could be the catalyst the cryptocurrency markets need to bring them over the top.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

In January, Shinhan, the second largest bank in South Korea, announced that it has begun the development of a bitcoin wallet and vault system with which bank users can safely store bitcoin in a cold wallet. In February, Shinhan completed trials with Ripple Labs, utilizing the Ripple network and its liquidity system xRapid to send cross-border payments in a blockchain network. \nThis month, Shinhan entered a strategic partnership with OmiseGo, an Ethereum-based banking and payments platform, to accelerate the adoption and implementation of blockchain technology in Asia, and more specifically, South Korea.\nIn South Korea, upon the completion of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Shinhan and the Ethereum startup, Omise CEO Jun Hasegawa stated:\n\u201cOmise and OmiseGO are working to revolutionize the way digital value moves globally, with an end goal of creating a platform that facilitates a decentralized economy. The OMG platform, using the Plasma architecture, is being built as a public network that is powered by Ethereum.

We want to make it easy for those who need online asset exchange as part of their business to connect seamlessly to the OMG Network.\u201d\nThe official statement of Omise revealed that in the upcoming months, Shinhan will closely work with Omise to integrate its blockchain technology in various areas of the bank\u2019s operations. Shinhancard, the credit card department of Shinhan Bank, is expected to develop new business models and key application opportunities based on the OmiseGo technology, becoming the first major credit card company in Asia to apply blockchain technology.\nOmise will also process Shinhan FAN card and overseas merchant base, potentially settling transactions for Shinhan merchants using the OmiseGo blockchain, and ultimately, the Ethereum blockchain.\n\u201cThe MoU establishes a framework for closer collaboration between each party; leveraging Omise\u2019s broad portfolio of payment technology and solutions, and OmiseGO\u2019s server and mobile SDKs that have been made publicly available for the purpose of onboarding e-wallet providers,\u201d the Omise team said.\nBitcoin Wallet\nIn November 2017, CCN reported that Shinhan began the development of its bitcoin wallet and vault system. Its representative stated:\n\u201cShinhan is testing a virtual bitcoin vault platform wherein the private keys of bitcoin addresses and wallets are managed and issued by the bank. The bank intends to provide the vault service for free and charge a fee for withdrawals.\u201d\nThe MoU between Omise and Shinhan could lead to the Omise development team cooperating with Shinhan in completing the development of its cryptocurrency wallet, given that the Omise team revealed the MoU was signed to allow Omise to cooperate with the major South Korean bank in developing a variety of blockchain solutions.", "category": "Banking"}

Of the 4,734\u00a0 interviewees, 206 were drawn from 640 who hold virtual currencies. Roughly 25% of the men who participated in the crypto holdings research\u00a0are beginners at investing, experiencing purchasing cryptocurrencies as a first investment.

Among those surveyed, those who hold virtual currencies weigh in at about 14%.\nRather than purchasing for settlement or remittance purposes, over 90% made the move as an investment objective. Still, for some, cryptocurrency investing is a trend to follow, 37.4% buying in for just that reason. Nearly one fifth invested in tokens based upon recommendations from those they know and/or media information thereof.\nNearly one-fourth of those making first-time virtual investments did so during October, November, and December of 2017, during which time the price of currencies was increasing.

Few people reported investing heavily, showing an overall cautious approach regarding virtual currencies.\nWhat is the hope for virtual currencies?\nWith nearly half of the men maintaining interest in active virtual currency investment in the future,\u00a0 a little over 35% of the interviewees don\u2019t intend to continue with the trend.

The entire cryptocurrency market including both major and minor cryptocurrencies has fallen over the past 48 hours.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Lack of Momentum\nSince its initial fall from $7,500 to $6,500, bitcoin has not been able to secure momentum to recover to the $7,000 region. Although momentum oscillators including Williams\u2019 Percent Range and Relative Strength Index (RSI) show oversold conditions, the market has not shown any intention to lead a new rally towards the $7,800 mark, which traders have considered as a major test for bitcoin since late March.\nThe fall in the momentum of bitcoin has coincided with a flurry of negative news, including the decision of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the central bank of India, to ban banks involved with the RBI from dealing with cryptocurrencies. While this is not a ban on cryptocurrency trading or exchanges, it could make it more difficult for cryptocurrency exchanges to secure partners and banking services.\nContrary to many reports published this week, the decision of the RBI will not have a profound impact on the Indian cryptocurrency market, given that exchanges are still operating as self-regulated businesses. More importantly, the Indian government has still not offered a clear stance towards the cryptocurrency market, and the federal government\u2019s policies could differ from that of its central bank.\nGlobally however, the Indian cryptocurrency exchange market has a small market share of the international bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets. Hence, it is unlikely that the announcement will have any major impact on the global bitcoin market. \nUS Tax Season\nEarlier this week, during an interview with CNBC, Wall Street analyst Tom Lee stated that cryptocurrency investors in the US owe as much as $25 billion to the Internal Revenue Service as gains tax. As such, Lee stated that it is likely the prices of cryptocurrencies could rebound after the tax season comes to an end, as CCN reported yesterday.\n\u201cApril 15 marks the end of tax season in the United States, and it\u2019s just around the corner.

But as soon as the bitcoin price gets rocked by volatility or worse, weakness, investors aren\u2019t the only ones to flee.\nIn the past few months, people on the job hunt have similarly demonstrated less of an interest in being hired by a cryptocurrency startup.

I would also have to convince other in the space that this is a good address format.\u201d This would eventually manifest as cashaddr.\nIn his Github post, cashaddr dev Hoenicke stated:\n\u201cThis needs to be done outside the firmware for cashaddr support. Webwallet: compute cashaddr addresses from xpub. Note that only the last step from hashed public key to address needs to be changed. The webwallet checks that the address the Trezor returns is as expected. This check should also allow 1.. addresses so that it works with older firmware (so we don\u2019t have to deploy both at the same time); allow cashaddr as send to address. The firmware supports both and both use SPENDADDRESS. The only difference is the confirmation message given to the user; the transaction format did not change at all.\u201d\nHoenicke clarifies that the change will not affect the means of transaction and handles the issues such as the misleading address keys once and for all. Trezor follows Coinbase and Bitpay in integrating cashaddr, helping to develop community consensus and raise the profile of the altcoin. There is currently no timeline at the moment, so users waiting to store their BCH will have to make do with the beta wallet for now before entering true cold storage.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The Nasdaq is down nearly 10% since the high on a variety of news. The Nasdaq, which tracks tech stocks has suffered under the weight of massive losses in market capitalization by the likes of Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter. The causes, which we\u2019ll analyze below, are two-fold. In typical American fashion, they both revolve around Donald Trump.\nThe first Trump revolving drag on the Nasdaq\u00a0has been the never-ending\u00a0controversy over Facebook. Facebook continues to suffer the fall out of the Cambridge Analytica Scandal. Here\u2019s how the story goes:\n\nAleksandr Kogan,\u00a0 a data scientist, develops a Facebook survey app called MyDigitalLife. MyDigitalLife amasses 300,000 users and has access to the data of more than 50 million of those users friends.\nCambridge Analytica\u00a0employed\u00a0Aleksandr Kogan\u00a0and used this data to create personality models on these 30 million Americans\nThe company was then able to use organic Facebook action: likes, shares, and comments to target \u201cpersuadable\u201d voters, leading to the election of Donald J. Trump\nChristopher Wylie blows the whistle\u00a0on Facebook, fallout ensues.\n\nIn the days since Wylie\u2019s stunning accusations, both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have both vehemently denied\u00a0these accusations. Nonetheless the damage has been done: Wylie and\u00a0Zuckerberg are testifying in front of Congress, and Zuckerberg has been asked(and refused) to appear before Parliament; Cambridge Analytica is being investigated by Nigeria for the role it played in their elections, and Palantir has launched an internal investigation\u00a0\u00a0into its own employees connections to Cambridge Analytica (a sensitive matter in front of a potential IPO).\nAll this chaos has certainly done damage to Facebooks stock. Since the scandal broke, it has dropped more than 15%. The fallout of the scandal has spread beyond Facebook and is being echoed across the social media sector with Twitter following Facebook: the stock is down by 22%\u00a0(despite not leaking any data). The scandal has, of course, raised broader questions over the sustainability of the business models of the many tech & media giants that appear on the Fortune 500 list and shows no signs of stopping.\nFurther dragging on the Nasdaq is retail giant Amazon. Amazon is the latest in a string of companies(62, to be exact) that Trump has attacked on Twitter. Trump has threatened to raise shipping costs to hurt Amazon, and is even rumored to be exploring anti-trust action against Amazon. Some speculate the real source of the president\u2019s ire is Amazon CEO Jeff Bezo\u2019s ownership of the Washington Post. Sources have said of the Washington Post that \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t like\u00a0The New York Times,\u00a0but he reveres it because it\u2019s his hometown paper.\u00a0The Washington Post,\u00a0he has zero respect for\u201d. Essentially, Trump is waging a personal war against Bezos. Whether they like him or hate him, the stock market reveres Donald Trump. This reverence is evinced by Amazon\u2019s 8% fall\u00a0\u00a0over the last month.\nThe Nasdaq\u2019s slump is expected to continue over the coming weeks and the market as a whole looks like it will remain flat. So what does this mean for crypto? I set out to answer the question of how the stock market affects crypto markets in my previous post \u201cHow Today\u2019s Stock Markets Crash Will Affect Cryptocurrency Markets\u201d and re-analyzed my conclusion in another article\u00a0later this month. The conclusion I arrived at, by comparing the VIX\u00a0and Bitcoin and concluding that as the market performs better, so will Bitcoin. So what\u2019s going on here? How can the entire crypto market be up when some of the biggest stocks are down double digits? Fundamentals.\nMy previous article\u00a0was based on a technical analysis of the market. It turns out, this uptick might have something to do with the applications of blockchain rather than the markets themselves. Late last month, CCN contributor Gerelyn Terzo wrote an article\u00a0examining how blockchain might fix the problems that plague centralized data systems like Facebook and allow users to reclaim their data. These same sentiments were echoed by the New York Times, CNBC, CNN and virtually every other mainstream media company. This in addition to broad market sentiment that all crypto is undervalued at current levels, a further legitimization of crypto and even a lawsuits against Google, Facebook, and Twitter for banning cryptocurrency advertising have combined to create the market conditions for a rally. We might even be starting to see the shift of crypto from a risky asset, to a hedge against centralized tech stocks that I described when the Dow Jones made a significant downturn last month. Only time will tell, but it\u2019d appear the whole market is feeling pretty good about crypto at the moment.", "category": "News"}

With a population of just 40,000 people, Liechtenstein is the sixth smallest country in the world and is home to more businesses than actual citizens due to the low tax rate. Liechtenstein is particularly attractive to blockchain businesses due to the extreme ease with which they can set up \u2013 it\u2019s not necessary to open a bank account to start a company, and the whole process can be handled with Ethereum or Bitcoin following the country\u2019s leading financial institution Bank Frick accepting cryptocurrency directly.

{"title": "New Crypto-Investor Psychology \u2013 Where Did These High Caps on High-Supply Coins Come From?", "url": "https://www.ccn.com/new-crypto-investor-psychology-where-did-these-high-caps-on-high-supply-coins-come-from/", "birthday": "2018-01-21T18:50:39+00:00", "date": "2018-01-21 18:50:39", "year": 2018, "month": 1, "day": 21, "content": "It was around noon \u2013 I was in my favorite bagel store getting my coffee when I overheard someone talking about cryptocurrency. I was quite excited, considering that I finally seem less of a cultist when I mention Bitcoin due to the media frenzy responsible for pulling in new investors. However, my excitement turned into a nervous sweat when the man said \u201chey, did you hear about this Ripple thing? People are saying it could be the next Bitcoin!\u201d\nThe market had been a bit unnerving,\u00a0to say the least \u2013 many legacy coins with massive supplies were exploding, and it had the tendency to be a bit confusing. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrency ran a couple hundred billion in just a few weeks, with unknown coins reaching new heights among well-established projects. Something was definitely wrong.\nThe Top is In. \nOn January 5th, CNBC contributor Brian Kelly participated in a segment on Fast Money showing consumers how to buy Ripple\u2019s XRP from popular cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex.\nU.S. based investors unfamiliar with cryptocurrency outside of the Coinbase quartet were probably shocked at the prospect of a cryptocurrency trading under $100 \u2013 let alone $10.\nNew retail investors saw the price of XRP as an opportunity to capitalize on discovering \u201cthe next Bitcoin,\u201d as many like to call their favorite cryptocurrency. However, for XRP to come even close to Bitcoin\u2019s price would require a market capitalization of over one quadrillion dollars.\nThe price of XRP at the time of the show was $2.57, and although it was being traded at a premium in Korea \u2013 it seems as if Fast Money pushed it during its swan song. As retail investors continued pouring money in, Ripple began its slow descent to under $2, until the recent slump drove it under $1.\nRipple wasn\u2019t the only \u201ccheap coin\u201d that followed these recent parabolic uptrends into a spiral \u2013 others including parody and rubbish such as ReddCoin, Verge, and even Dentacoin did as well.\nThe psychology behind the drive was most likely the following: why buy a fraction of a Bitcoin (whether or not the investor knows that\u2019s possible), when you can own a \u201ccheaper\u201d coin in abundance? To someone new to cryptocurrency, what sounds more appealing: 0.54132 Bitcoin, or over 5,000 XRP?\nHigh Supply \u2013 Misinformed and Negligence \nTo those who believe that XRP has a similar chance at breaching the $10,000 mark, as Bitcoin has \u2013 I\u2019m sorry to burst your bubble. Even at $10 which many see XRP hitting, its market capitalization would be somewhere around $1 trillion assuming the entire supply is accounted for. That\u2019s a drop under double the market capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency market.\nIt could be a probable scenario if the market capitalization of cryptocurrency were to hit the multi-trillions sector, but for now,\u00a0it seems to be a bit of a pipe-dream to assume that an asset will float that high in the near future.\nThis isn\u2019t a bash to Ripple\u2019s technology, but rather an observation on potential price-points of a certain asset. The same rules apply to most cryptocurrencies that have high supply numbers, whether or not they have solid technology behind them.\nTake for example Sia \u2013 a decentralized cloud storage solution. During the low price-point madness, the price of Sia shot from under $0.03 to over $0.10 in a matter of a few days. It has been around long enough\u00a0but already had a $1 billion market capitalization. It was simply another case of \u201ccheap-coin\u201d while neglecting supply metrics. Again, this isn\u2019t a knock on Sia\u2019s technology \u2013 it\u2019s quite great. However, the price wasn\u2019t justified, and the market movement was simply caused by new investors. Kin can be included in this mix as well.\nThe darker side of this were the coins that were not up-to-par\u00a0and pumped for the same reason. Take Dentacoin for example \u2013 is the global dentistry industry really going to adopt an Ethereum token? Raise some money, buy some clinics, claim for them to be independent partners, and wrap things up nice and tightly. Fine, have your ICO, and your own cryptocurrency, but nearly a $2 billion market capitalization on January 8th with little to show for it? Something is wrong here.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the supply and price-point metrics: an eight trillion Dentacoin max supply total, a circulating supply of over 325 billion, and a price well under a penny. It\u2019s a recipe for attracting new money.\nHowever, part of the rise of some of these gray-coins as I call them, came from well-known cybersecurity expert John McAfee, as he initiated a wave of buying through his \u201ccoin of the day\u201d scheme.\nMcAfee, Master Manipulator \nBack on December 13th, McAfee tweeted his love for privacy coins, as well as a follow-up the next day regarding a \u201cprivacy coin\u201d formerly known as DogeCoin Dark, now known as Verge (XVG). In his tweet, McAfee mentioned that it\u2019s \u201ceasier\u201d for a coin to go from $0.03 to $3.00 than it is for one to go from $300 to $30,000.\nAfter his tweet, Verge spiked, going from a low of $0.013 to an all-time high of $0.30 just a week later \u2013 a gain of over %2,300. A coin with little to no function saw a market capitalization of over $4.4 billion, simply because of its pricing and a small bump from a popular figure.\nMcAfee then decided to capitalize on his newly discovered powers by entertaining his followers with a \u201ccoin of the day\u201d series, in which he announced mostly high-supply coins that his new-investor following would eat up because of their price points.\nElectroneum, an infantile fork of the Monero codebase that held an ICO and really hasn\u2019t accomplished much was the first of his picks on December 21st. Just a short bit later, and Electroneum managed to spike nearly 60% before leveling out to a drop higher than the day\u2019s low. To hark back to the \u201ccheap\u201d idea, Electroneum was trading below $0.10\u00a0but has a multi-billion circulating supply of nearly 6 billion.\nMcAfee continued this trend with his next few choices, including Burst (1.8b circulating), Digibyte (9.7b circulating), ReddCoin (28.7b circulating), and even DogeCoin (112.8b circulating) which became his \u201ccoin of the week\u201d on January 8th. Some picked up on the trend and began using McAfee\u2019s tweets to \u201cpump and dump\u201d the coins of his choosing.\nEven the creator of DogeCoin, Jackson Palmer, tweeted out his confusion, as ridiculous assets with minimal underlying technology began assuming high market capitalizations. However, it\u2019s easy to manipulate new investors who believe in the potential of an asset to explode due to a low price and a neglect for circulating supplies.\nExchanges Temporarily Halt Registration\nNew investors have figured out how to purchase altcoins, and they now understand where to do if the activity McAfee facilitated was indicative of anything. Exchanges were definitely not equipped to handle the sudden increase in traffic, as many of them displayed through halting new user registrations.\nBitfinex was the first to close their doors in December due to the number of new users coming in\u00a0until they reopened just a few days ago with new requirements. On December 14th, Bittrex announced a turn-off of user registrations due to a \u201clarge spike\u201d in signups. Binance temporarily disabled new registrations on January 5th, and mentioned an \u201coverwhelming surge in popularity.\u201d\nEven Cryptopia had to shut their doors a day later on January 6th to handle registrations, before reopening a few days later.\nAn exchange account black-market quickly opened up, as investors that lacked accounts on certain exchanges began buying them off other users for a premium. Prices ranged anywhere from a few hundred, to even a few thousand dollars for verified accounts. Binance noticed this trend, and quickly put out a notice warning any individuals wishing to buy accounts about the associated security risks.\nThese temporary shutdowns were only indicative of the number of new buyers in the space, looking to capitalize on the frenzy-period. Little did they know that a large wash-out was coming just a few days later.\nThe Tuesday Night Massacre \nOver the past week, the entire cryptocurrency market has taken quite the beating. Some are attributing the decline to news out of Asia, in which a media frenzy that came out of South Korea after some exchange drama hit. Others, see the decline as a conspiracy surrounding the close of the first round of the futures market, bundled with plenty of price manipulation from Wall Street.\nAfter a 50% decline in the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, signs of life are finally starting to reappear.\nRegardless of the cause of the drop, new investors were most likely shaken out as they weren\u2019t prepared for the true volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Hopefully, this stomps out any form of Phoenix that some expected these high-supply, underwhelming technology coins to pull, and they meet their timely demise (except DogeCoin \u2013 that can stay). It\u2019s time for a radical adjustment.", "category": "News"}

The cause? Online seed generators.\nOnline seed generators for IOTA are websites that provide users with a quick solution to generate a new seed for their IOTA wallet.\nWhen creating a new IOTA wallet, users are tasked with creating an 81-character seed rather than generation being baked-in. There are workarounds as outlined by the HelloIOTA website, which includes using an IPFS seed generator, or creating a key using either the Mac or Linux terminal. However, neither of which is as user-friendly as other wallets \u2013 possibly leaving new users turning toward these online generators.\nThe top hit for online seed generation for IOTA wallets has since taken down its website, leaving a message simply stating \u201cTaken down. Apologies.\u201d The generator would require viewers to move their mouse around to \u201cgenerate randomness,\u201d and then provide a seed that fit the requirements of an IOTA wallet. It also provided a version of the seed encoded as a mnemonic phrase as well.\nAccording to a blog post from IOTA Evangelist Network member Ralf Rottmann, the attackers deployed a DDoS attack against popular IOTA fullnodes, leaving victims of the robbery unable to rescue any of their funds.\nThe attackers knew the seeds. You invited them into your wallet, by handing them your keys on a silver platter. The community of fullnode operators is discussing various strategies to better protect public community nodes from this specific and similar DDoS attacks in the future.\nThe IOTA community has been quite clear about online seed generators, encouraging users to change elements of the seed in order to prevent any vulnerabilities. They have also been repeatedly pointing to the fact that the vulnerability has nothing to do with IOTA\u2019s technology, and rather just seed generating services.\nIOTA has gone through a bit of drama in recent times with their Microsoft partnership clarification after a botched press cycle, and patched vulnerabilities found back in the fall. In October, the IOTA team also took custody of at-risk funds due to another vulnerability with the use of a snapshot.\nAlthough quite ambitious, the tangle seems to always be tangled up in controversy.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

At the time, 17 cryptocurrency exchanges were being reviewed and throughout the past three months, more cryptocurrency exchanges have been approved to operate.\nIn the upcoming weeks, MUFG plans to gather necessary resources and talents to open a cryptocurrency exchange and file for an application to the Japanese FSA. However, Mainichi Shimbun reported that filing for the application to operate a cryptocurrency exchange in Japan is difficult, and the bank will need to undergo a rigorous process to launch a trading platform for digital assets.\nTwo months ago, CCN also reported that Shinhan Bank, the second largest commercial bank in South Korea, has started the development and testing of a bitcoin wallet and vault system, to provide secure services to existing cryptocurrency users.\nA rapidly increasing number of financial institutions are entering the cryptocurrency market and the entrance of strictly regulated financial service providers will provide cryptocurrency traders a wider range of platforms to use to secure their portfolio of assets and cryptocurrencies.\nReleasing a Token\nAccording to Mainichi Shimbun, MUFG is also considering the launch of a crypto-token that hedges the token\u2019s value to the price of Japanese yen. Essentially, MUFG would operate a reserve of Japanese yen, and produce an equivalent amount of MUFG token to match the price of the Japanese yen.\nLocal media outlets reported that MUFG\u2019s token would serve as a crypto-asset to protect traders against market volatility. In periods of extreme volatility and large market corrections, traders can seamlessly move their assets into the MUFG Japanese yen-backed token and prevent temporary volatility from affecting their existing assets.\nConceptually, the MUFG\u2019s crypto-token is similar to USDT, or Tether, which hedges the token\u2019s value to the price of US dollars.\nGiven that USDT has been controversial due to the lack of proper third-party audits, in order for MUFG to operate a legitimate Japanese yen-backed cryptocurrency, it would have to conduct a third-party audit to ensure that each MUFG token is backed by the Japanese yen.\nThe timeframe of the launch of MUFG\u2019s cryptocurrency exchange remains unclear, and the Japanese bank has not disclosed any additional information apart from that provided by Japanese media outlets. \nIt is optimistic for the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange market that major banks, specifically the biggest bank in the country, is planning to enter the cryptocurrency market and address growing demand for cryptocurrencies.", "category": "Banking"}

Earlier on Tuesday, bitcoin\u2019s $10,000 support level had collapsed, plunging the flagship cryptocurrency back into four-figure territory. However, after consolidating at $9,900, the bitcoin price surged back to $11,000 and is currently trading at $11,112 on Bitfinex.

Gox breach that drove the market into hibernation. \u00a0Add these to the tally and over $12.5bln worth of cryptocurrency has been filched over the years.\nIn the thick of the trouble, wallets have had their fair share of run-ins. \u00a0Back in July, hackers compromised Parity, a popular Ethereum multisignature wallet, running off with 153,000 ETH (worth nearly $200mln at its current exchange rate). \u00a0In November, a Tether treasury wallet lost $31mln to an attacker linked to a 2015 Bitstamp exchange hack.\nOverall, however, cryptocurrency exchanges bore the brunt of malicious actors in 2017, and South Korean exchanges in particular were on hackers\u2019 hit lists. \u00a0Youbit, formerly known as Yapizon, lost 3,816 Bitcoin in April of 2017. \u00a0Valued $5mln at the time of the hack, the total cost of this attack now tops $50mln. \u00a0To make matters worse, Youbit was hit again in December, forcing it to file for bankruptcy after losing 17% of its funds.\u00a0 further, in July, news broke that 30,000 user accounts on Bithumb, South Korea\u2019s largest exchange, were exposed in a data breach that left billions of won stolen. \u00a0In current market prices, customers suffered a collective loss of at least $10mln.\nDecentralized Exchanges May Provide a Solution\nAll of these compromised exchanges\u2013Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Youbit, Bithtumb\u2013are centralized. \u00a0This is nothing out of the ordinary, as most all major exchanges are centralized. \u00a0There are obvious reasons for this, the most apparent being convenience, but these reasonings often overlook security concerns.\nWhen an exchange is centralized, this centralization comes in two forms: asset control and system management.\u00a0 With asset control, exchanges operate much like trusted institutions such as banks; when you use a centralized exchange, you agree to let the exchange hold your funds and private for you until you wish to withdraw your currency. \u00a0Exchanges will often hold customer funds in a hot wallet reserve (online) and cold wallet reserve (offline).\nThe other form of centralization refers to how an exchange stores its data and the infrastructure it uses to support itself. \u00a0Larger exchanges have to outsource server space, often to cloud services, in order to accommodate website traffic, and this usually means that hosting servers are allocated in a single source.\nStarting to get the picture? \u00a0If a hacker wants to hit a centralized exchange, they need only to go through a central entryway, usually a third-party hosting server. \u00a0Once in, the hacker then has access to a central source of funding, the exchange\u2019s hot wallet reserve and private keys.\nOf course, major exchanges have a number of security features in place to insulate themselves against malicious actors. \u00a0But as precedent has shown, these measures don\u2019t always go far enough. \u00a0\nThis is why we need decentralized exchanges. \u00a0They pick up the slack that centralized exchanges, because of their inherent design, can\u2019t. \u00a0As such, decentralized exchanges (DEXs, for short) offer a number of enhanced security benefits.\nNo central point of entry or control\nUnlike their centralized counterparts, DEXs are not controlled by a single entity. \u00a0The domain server that people access to use the exchange is centralized, of course, but no one entity controls the marketplace, nor is the exchange supported by a single server. \u00a0\nAs they currently stand, most decentralized exchanges are built on the Ethereum blockchain and are supported by a network of nodes rather than a centralized server. \u00a0This means that an attacker would have to compromise half of the nodes that support an exchange to control it, a practically impossible feat.\nUser controlled funds \nSince there is no one entity that owns a DEX, there is no central hub that controls user funds. \u00a0Decentralized exchanges are trustless, meaning users are always in control of their assets and all trades are peer-to-peer. \u00a0\nTo accomplish this, DEXs manage currencies using Ethereum-powered smart contracts. \u00a0Once funds are locked into a smart contract, only someone with the corresponding private keys can touch the funds. \u00a0Under a centralized system, you relinquish your private keys, and they are all pooled into a single ledger that reflects the exchange\u2019s hot wallet reserve. \u00a0If a hacker gets its hands on these keys, your funds can be swept away. \u00a0Under a decentralized system, you\u2019re always in control of your own private keys, and so long as you don\u2019t reveal them to a malicious third party, your assets are safe in a DEX\u2019s smart contract.\nIntegration with Hardware Wallets\nThis is perhaps the biggest benefit a DEX has to offer. \u00a0Most decentralized exchanges, such as Ether Delta and IDEX, can sync up with the Ledger Nano S or Trezor hardware wallets. \u00a0Alongside cold storage, hardware wallets are the safest options for storing and managing personal funds, as they are impervious to the same malware that can compromise software wallets. \u00a0Using a hardware wallet compliant DEX, you can plug in your Ledger or Trezor and send funds directly into the exchange\u2019s smart contracts. \u00a0This is preferable to manually entering your private keys, as manual entry is vulnerable to phishing and keylogging attacks.\nDEXs Still Have a Ways to Go\nWhile they\u2019re a better option than more popular centralized options, decentralized exchanges, as they currently operate, are far from perfect.\nAs EtherDelta taught us last December, they\u2019re still prone to phishing attacks through the exchange\u2019s domain name server. \u00a0Still, as I argue here, the security features inherent to the exchange minimized the damage done. \u00a0Accounts that used Meta Mask or Ledger to manage funds were completely safe even if they used the fake site, and if you never revealed your private keys on the fraudulent domain, your coins were safe in their smart contracts. \u00a0By today\u2019s rates, over $500,000 worth of funds were nabbed, and while this number isn\u2019t laughable, it\u2019s much less than we\u2019ve seen stolen through centralized exchanges.\nTo continue with DEX downsides, there\u2019s a reason centralized exchanges are more popular: they\u2019re easier to use. \u00a0Newcomers may get frustrated with the maze of smart contracts they must navigate to begin trading. \u00a0Sure, you don\u2019t have to sign up or get verified to use a DEX, but you have to transfer funds back and forth from your personal wallet to an exchange wallet every time you want to trade. \u00a0You\u2019re also at the mercy of the Ethereum network everytime you want to move funds or make a trade. \u00a0If the network is congested, you may face, at best, higher transaction fees or, at worst, a buggy, unresponsive trading system.\nThere are a number of projects looking to ameliorate these issues. \u00a00x, for example, is implementing an off-chain ordering system in conjunction with an on-chain trading system. \u00a0In theory, this will give the DEX the quick order matching system of a centralized exchange without sacrificing security. Blocknet is another DEX that hopes to bring cross change atomic swaps to streamline decentralized trading and make it even more secure.\nI believe decentralized exchanging will be the future of cryptocurrency trading, as it is necessary for the ecosystem\u2019s financial health and future survival. \u00a0Hopefully, 2018 will bring a slew of innovations for this unrefined system, and hopefully, these innovations will help to mend the losses suffered under the current centralized standard.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

During a one-month period, the global average ripple price\u00a0rocketed from just $0.25 to an all-time high of $3.84, creating XRP millionaires almost overnight and briefly making Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen the nominal eighth-richest person in the world.\nThe downside to these breakneck rallies, however, is that their declines are often equally as precipitous. This has proven to be the case this week, as ripple has been among the coins hardest hit by a severe correction that has reverberated throughout the cryptoasset markets.\nOn Wednesday, the ripple price dropped to $0.99 on Bittrex, marking its first dip below dollar parity since late December, when it crossed the $1 threshold for the first time.

Ted Budd (R-NC) of the House Financial Services Committee on Jan. 10 introduced the Financial Technology Innovation and Defense Act to Congress. A key feature of the bill is a fintech task force designed to reward tipsters offering viable information about digital currencies and terrorist use. US\u00a0policymakers have cryptocurrency-fueled terror on their bipartisan radar, as evidenced by a similar bill, the Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists Use of Virtual Currencies Act, drafted by Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-NY) last May.\nThe fact that US lawmakers are focused on intercepting the illegal use of cryptocurrencies and enforcing ethical standards is a positive development for the industry, as it suggests that policymakers have come to terms with a digital coin world even if they\u2019re not in the center of it. It seems like a much more productive use of resources versus attempting to thwart bitcoin to pay for transactions at retailers, for instance.\nRep. Budd\u2019s bill proposes the establishment of an\u00a0Independent Financial Technology Task Force comprised of half-a-dozen federal officials and a handful from the private sector across banking, nonprofits and think tanks. These individuals would be selected by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who would also be included in the Task Force and who recently weighed in on the threat of treating bitcoin as an offshore Swiss account for money-laundering.\nNuts and Bolts\nSimilar to how the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) offers rewards for information leading to the most-wanted criminals, the task force would create a program to compensate \u201cany person who provides information leading to the conviction of an individual involved with terrorist use of digital currencies,\u201d as per the bill. It doesn\u2019t disclose the size of the reward or whether it would be paid in fiat money or bitcoin.\nThe task force would further develop a portfolio, dubbed the Fintech Leadership in Innovation Fund, which would be dedicated to developing tools to uncover terror financing and other \u201cillicit use of digital currencies.\u201d Through the fund, the task force can also distribute grants to US companies, universities, etc. that they deem relevant. In making these distributions, officials are especially keen on technologies that support KYC/AML protocols.\nAt about the same pace lawmakers and regulators are crafting policy, they\u2019re learning about cryptocurrencies. A Senate panel is scheduled to\u00a0hear testimony from CFTC and SEC officials on bitcoin and the apparent risks to the financial sector in early February, as per a Reuters report.

As international trade and logistics continues to expand, more efficient methods are being developed to enable effective service delivery and value transfer, however certain limitations still exist, making it necessary for blockchain implementation which would enable the application of its inherent properties.\nGetting rid of human interference\nCEO of Netcoins, Michael Vogel tells CCN that the main limitation of any logistical system is the human component. According to Vogel, whether it is data entry, auditing, errors due to typos or miscalculations, all processes which involve a human touchpoint introduce possibility for delays or errors. In fact this is why VISA Europe is exploring the idea of using Bitcoin and blockchain technology behind-the-scenes to improve internal fund settlements (to improve response time and accuracy).\n\u201cBlockchain is the perfect tool for logistics because it takes the traditional database to the next level, an immutable record which is ideal for audit-keeping and immune to tampering\u201d, says Vogel.\nHe also notes considering accounting as part of logistics, the dawn of blockchain has created an opportunity for the concept of \u201ctriple-ledger\u201d accounting, an idea in which a third accounting ledger based in a blockchain is kept along with all financial records. This allows for instant auditing, as opposed to the traditional practice of quarterly reviews.\n\u201cAs soon as Blockchain networks begin taking their first steps on a mass-market level, they will save the international trade industry at least $50 billion USD per year. And upon maturity, Blockchain technology could save the logistics industry a whopping $500 billion USD per year in mundane expenses, along with other benefits that come along the way\u201d, says John Monarch CEO at ShipChain.\nA higher level of security\nMonarch explains that connected devices revolving around the Internet of Everything (IoE) need a higher level of security. Monarch notes that Blockchain technology is a matchless solution in this regard because it provides the best protection through distributed ledgers, advanced encryption, smart-contracts and reduced intermediaries. As a result, this will tackle corruption, ransomware, theft, premium-fees and tracking issues.\nAs at the time of writing, the logistics sector employs the most people in the world, and as this sector expanded over millennia, it has required innovation to scale and sustain practicality for the growing human population. This is happening again at the time of writing, with the fourth industrial revolution.\nRemoving waste\nAccording to Jeremy Epstein, CEO of Never Stop Marketing, one of the biggest challenges in supply chains is redundant systems that don\u2019t talk with each other. This he says adds a huge amount of friction and cost in terms of the supply chain. Epstein notes that different organizations, be it governments or vendors, spend a lot of time verifying that shipments contain the items they are supposed to.

Bitcoin is already a top 30 currency by supply, and this trend, and pressure to hold digital currency as part of reserves will only accelerate as the price rises,\u201d said Smith.\nSome Central Banks Already Sitting on Bitcoin\nIn December 2017, it was reported that the Bulgarian government has more than $3 billion in bitcoin in its account, mostly from funds seized during law enforcement investigations and crackdown on dark web marketplace operators.\nIn May, the Bulgarian authorities officially stated that it had seized 213,519 bitcoins that are now worth over $3.2 billion, given the price of bitcoin at $15,000.\n\u201cAs result of this criminal activity the damages recorded by the Customs Agency, only for year 2015, is around 10 million Leva. As well, up to now were found in the virtual space bitcoin wallets of the main suspects with a total value of 213,519 bitcoins,\u201d the Bulgarian government said.\nIn addition to law enforcement seizures of bitcoin, global central banks will likely begin to acquire large sums of bitcoin, Ether, and other major cryptocurrencies because the digital currency market has grown at an exponential rate over the past few years. Bitcoin in particular has achieved a market valuation of $250 billion, and analyst expect it to continue evolving into a premier store of value, eventually competing against the $8 trillion gold market.\nMoreover, if bitcoin becomes one of the reserve currencies of the global economy by targeting the $40 trillion offshore banking market, $8 trillion gold market, and the $50 trillion fiat currency market, governments will need to have a supply of bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies as the leading financial authorities.\nHowever, the acquisition of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the market could demonstrate a sign of defeat to the general public, considering that for more than two full years, some of the leading central banks and government agencies in China, Europe, and the UK have been working on issuing central bank-issued cryptocurrencies.\nTwo years later with hundreds of millions of dollars invested in research and development, central banks are not even close to testing government-backed cryptocurrencies. The lack of progress in central bank-backed cryptocurrency development is a result of the aggressive implementation of an ambitious plan that was never realistic to begin with.\nThe entire purpose of cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based networks is based on the fundamental concept of decentralization. On blockchain networks, users can send and receive payments, transactions, and information on a peer-to-peer basis.\nIn the future, whether central banks believe in the technology that supports bitcoin or not would be of less importance. The investment and security value of bitcoin alone would lead governments to acquire massive amounts of cryptocurrencies, especially if they begin to show signs of evolving into global reserve currencies.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

That also meant that a platform and infrastructure for bitcoin critics would be introduced, so that investors that truly believe bitcoin is a fraud or a scam can bet against it.\nSo far, investors have not bet against bitcoin and placed a substantially large number of short contracts against the cryptocurrency. As of January 2018, investors and critics have failed to express their confidence on the downward trend of bitcoin and acquire short positions in bitcoin.\nSuch a behavior from investors and critics demonstrates a simple mindset: delusion. Critics do not want bitcoin to evolve into a major asset class, even if it already has because it defeats the fundamentals and philosophies conventional economists have built for many decades.\nBut, critics are not confident that bitcoin will fall in value, because of the growing liquidity of the cryptocurrency, exponentially increasing adoption of bitcoin, and the global market\u2019s acknowledgment of bitcoin as a premier store of value, medium of exchange, and digital currency.\nWhat Happens Next?\nThe general public and consumers have started to understand that bitcoin has become a major asset class that cannot be dismissed by major financial institutions. This week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon publicly stated that he regrets calling bitcoin a fraud, and admitted that he was wrong about it.\nBitcoin will continue to evolve into a premier asset and digital currency, despite the baseless criticism from conventional economists.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

The news took the wind out of the market\u2019s sails, and led by the bitcoin price, every top 100-cryptocurrency lost value against the US dollar.\nPeople\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) officials had already banned domestic order-book exchanges, but mainland residents were often still able to access some foreign exchanges, as well as over-the-counter (OTC) trading platforms. With this move, though, the PBoC seeks to further isolate China\u2019s 1.4 billion residents from the global cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nUnsurprisingly, the cryptocurrency market cap careened downward by more than $150 billion, although it has since experienced a slight recovery to $574 billion. Even at this level, though, the cryptocurrency market cap is down 18 percent for the day.\nBitcoin Price Plunges Below $12,000\nThe bitcoin price set the tone for the day, and it was not a pleasant one. The most prominent cryptocurrency declined by more than 14 percent to a present value of $11,750 on Bitfinex. Amazingly, this correction forced bitcoin\u2019s market cap below $200 billion for the first time in nearly a month, and its circulating supply is currently valued at $199.6 billion.\nBitcoin Price Chart\nAlthough the move is concerning, this is not the first time that the PBoC has injected turbulence into the markets through hostile regulatory policies. In each of the previous cases, the bitcoin price was quick to consolidate and return to a position of strength, so there is no reason to believe the markets will fail to rebound from this report, too.\nEthereum Price Fights to Hold Above $1,000\nNo major cryptocurrency was immune from the correction, and the Ethereum price was among those hardest hit. The second largest cryptocurrency posted a 22 percent decline, and the Ethereum price dove as low as $966 before inching its way back to $1,072. At present, Ethereum has a $101.3 billion market cap.\nEthereum Price Chart\nRipple\u2019s 25 Percent Decline Headlines Bloody Altcoin Market\nEthereum\u2019s poor performance was matched by the wider cryptocurrency markets, and altcoin market caps declined by a combined $102 billion for the day.\n\nRipple price plunged by 25 percent to $1.36, reducing its market cap to $52.1 billion. The bitcoin cash price declined by 19 percent, which knocked it below the $2,000 mark to a present value of $1,965.\nFifth-ranked Cardano lost 22 percent, and the litecoin price managed to hold above $200 despite a 16 percent pullback. NEM declined by 13 percent, while NEO\u2019s four percent decline constituted the best performance among top 10-cryptocurrencies.\nThe stellar price declined by 23 percent to $0.48, and IOTA\u2019s 18 percent decline dropped its price to $2.98 to round out the top 10.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

He wrote:\n\u201cWe should stress that, as money, cryptocurrencies should have low expected returns in the long run, despite their high returns recently. Digital currencies should be thought of as low/zero return or hedge-like assets, akin to gold or certain other metals.\u201d\nHowever, Pandl also provided a negative viewpoint on the price trend of bitcoin and the exponential growth rate of the cryptocurrency market, sharing the sentiment of experts within the cryptocurrency market such as Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and co-founder Charles Hoskinson.\nIn December, Buterin stated:\n\u201cSo total cryptocoin market cap just hit $0.5 trillion today. But have we earned it? How many unbanked people have we banked? How much censorship-resistant commerce for the common people have we enabled? How many dapps have we created that have substantial usage? Low added value per user for using a blockchain is fine, but then you have to make up for it in volume.\nThe answer to all of these questions is definitely not zero, and in some cases it\u2019s quite significant. But not enough to say it\u2019s $0.5 trillion levels of significant. Not enough.\u201d\nWhile the market valuation of several major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum could be justified given their massive user bases and increasing user activity, the market valuation of other cryptocurrencies in the market can be questioned. In that sense, Pandl\u2019s description of the cryptocurrency market as a \u201cclassic speculative bubble\u201d could also be justified.\nBitcoin\u2019s Potential\nBut, as Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein explained in an interview with CNBC, if bitcoin is the natural progression from fiat money or physical forms of money to digital currencies, the market valuation of bitcoin can be easily justified.\nBlankfein emphasized that abolishment of the gold standard and the abrupt introduction of the fiat currency system was not accepted and adopted by individuals and businesses at first. Over time, the global economy adapted to the fiat currency system and began using it as the main form of money.\nBitcoin could lead to the natural progression from fiat currencies to digital currencies, similar to the change from gold to the US dollar.\u201cYou move a little bit further and you get bitcoin that is not a fiat currency so I don\u2019t trust, it and I don\u2019t like it. On the other hand, if it works, I say maybe it was a natural progression from hard money to digital money,\u201d said Blankfein.", "category": "Bitcoin & Blockchain Investments"}

He noted that he will no longer serve as a full-time partner of the firm, but will remain as an advisor.\nDuring an interview with TechCrunch, Buterin emphasized that although the cryptocurrency market has demonstrated an exponential increase in users and valuation, the practical usability of blockchains have regressed to the rising transaction fees and scalability issues. \nTo address the growing demand for Ethereum and the high expectations from the global Ethereum community, Buterin explained that he will solely focus on the development of the Ethereum blockchain network and solving scalability issues to provide a better ecosystem for decentralized applications. He stated:\n\u201cI expect 2018, at least within the Ethereum space that I\u2019m best able to speak about, will be the year of action. It will be the year where all of the ideas around scalability, Plasma, proof-of-stake, and privacy that we have painstakingly worked on and refined over the last four years are finally going to turn into real, live working code that you can play around in a highly mature form in some cases on testnets, and in some key cases even on the public mainnet.\u201d\nThe statement of Buterin came after several experts in the cryptocurrency sector including Augur co-founder Joey Krug said that there is a clear lack of developers working on scaling solutions for the Ethereum network. The rise in the popularity of successful decentralized applications such as CryptoKitties, EtherDelta, and 0x have congested the Ethereum network, which is already processing more transactions than all of the blockchains in the global market combined.\nScalability Issues\nAccording to Etherscan, the Ethereum network is processing around 1.2 million transactions on a daily basis, which is more than 4 times larger than the daily transaction volume of bitcoin.\n\nBut, as the developers of Bankex explained, who recently introduced a practical implementation of Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon\u2019s Plasma, a scaling solution that uses interconnected blockchains to reduce the congestion of the main Ethereum blockchain network, apps like CryptoKitties are executing hundreds of thousands of transations on regular basis, filling the Ethereum network with large-size transactions.\nSome decentralized applications like 0x have off-chain solutions to execute orders or transactions off-chain and broadcast them to the main Ethereum network after batching many transactions into one single transaction. Still, the vast majority of applications still do not have innovative solutions to reduce the congestion of the Ethereum network.\nAs such, Krug emphasized that developers working on Ethereum scaling solutions are crucial for the ecosystem, and there must be more developers contributing to the open-source codebase of Ethereum scaling solutions.\n\u201cEthereum really needs more developers on problems like sharding, proof of stake, and plasma, right now there simply aren\u2019t enough. It should also hire some more operations people to help orchestrate it all, for instance, Solidity is just now being formally audited. Ethereum would be 100x more kickass with these things [and around] 10 developers each working on all three of those hard problems above.\u201d", "category": "Ethereum News"}

The move, however, may not affect all miners as the People\u2019s Bank of China has only laid down a plan affecting a small subset of all mining companies in a meeting held on January 3, 2018. Part of the plan also involves keeping track of the electricity consumed by such large-scale operations and debating whether they are unfairly affecting power prices in the areas around them.\u00a0An official in the Xinjiang province told the Wall Street Journal that the Chinese government had sent notices to local agencies and that he would be doing \u201cwhat the country wants.\u201d\nIn anticipation of such a restrictive policy being introduced, industry leaders with expansive mining operations have already been looking at other options overseas. Jiang Zhuoer, the founder of China\u2019s third largest bitcoin mining pool, BTC.TOP, revealed in an interview with Bloomberg\u00a0that the company\u00a0 \u201cchose Canada because of the relatively cheap cost, and the stability of the country and policies\u201d.\nAccording to Wu Jihan, CEO of the Chinese company Bitmain , his company is responsible for the production of around 70 percent of all bitcoin mining rigs currently in use. Bitmain also runs two of China\u2019s largest bitcoin mining pools and is currently moving its regional headquarters to Singapore. It has also managed to set up its operations in the United States and Canada. Based off a report from the Swiss newspaper Handelszeitung, Bitmain has also established a subsidiary in Switzerland, which a company spokesperson said was chosen because it is \u201cone of the most progressive countries\u2026with good legal stability\u201d. Likewise, ViaBTC, the fourth largest pool is also eliminating its dependence on China by starting its mining operations in North America and Iceland.\nPhilip Gradwell, chief economist at Chinalysis Inc, a blockchain analysis firm, stated in an interview with the Wall Street Journal:\n\u201cIf China really does switch off all the minters suddenly, there could be a very high level of disruption. It\u2019s very hard to estimate back-of-the-envelope how big an impact would be.\u201d\nHe also believes that bitcoin could be in trouble, at least for a few weeks, before the network would be able to readjust the rate of mining new coins.\nArthur Hayes, CEO of the Chinese cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, said:\n\u201cI don\u2019t think miners have been sitting on their hands. Some people have already moved their hardware out of China.\u201d\nChina, being an industrial nation, offers enterprises inexpensive electricity among other utilities. This is an especially important consideration since Digiconomist estimates that the annual power consumption due to bitcoin mining is a staggering 37.8 TWh, surpassing the total consumption of several nations, or 3.5 million average US households. Mining activities are, therefore, only profitable in the event that the electricity available to the parent companies is heavily subsidized. China can offer such discounts on energy prices due to its massive investment in coal and hydropower.\nStudies have repeatedly shown that Chinese bitcoin miners account for a rather large percentage of the total bitcoin mining efforts worldwide. In fact, as much as 71 percent of all bitcoin mining pools are based in the country, at least as of mid 2017. The Chinese government\u2019s crackdown on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency exchanges in September, 2017 may have deterred some of them, but the country is still home to a lion\u2019s share of the mining efforts.\nThe ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) hardware used to mine bitcoin and other similar proof-of-work based cryptocurrencies are also almost exclusively manufactured in China, making it readily accessible for mining businesses in bulk quantities. As a whole, the Chinese have a relatively large monopoly over the cryptocurrency mining ecosystem, both in terms of market share and manufacturing.\nChina\u2019s move to ban bitcoin miners, even selectively so, is likely in response to recent reports indicating the scale and extent of power consumption due to bitcoin mining. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem grows and bitcoin\u2019s usage progressively increases as it has for several years now, the electricity usage is only expected to continue rising with time.", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

Taiwan\u2019s capital is partnering with Berlin nonprofit IOTA Foundation for its IoT-driven Tangle technology as well as BiiLabs, a blockchain startup, for its transformation into an app-driven smart city, one that IOTA\u2019s co-founder\u00a0Dominik Schiener says will affect voter fraud.\nTaipei mayor\u00a0\u00a0Ko Wen-je\u00a0recently traveled to Warsaw in a trip whose mission included a focus on smart cities, and this partnership with IOTA is evidence of his commitment to the technology.\nIOTA\u2019s distributed ledger technology is unique because it uses a proprietary protocol dubbed Tangle, which is famous for having no blocks and no miners. Tangle is being used in the first IOTA/Tapei project app and is known for Internet of Things (IOT) applications ranging from smart watches to \u201cfeeless micropayment-based electric vehicle charging.\u201d\nThe partners are exploring ways in which IOTA\u2019s technology can be integrated into the smart city to bolster data integrity and trust in public service and beyond. Taipei City joins the likes of participants including Microsoft that have turned to IOTA\u2019s data marketplace (though as IOTA stressed, the Microsoft relationship is not a partnership.) IOTA says the marketplace \u201cshowcases\u201d the IOTA protocol and flaunts how \u201cmicropayment-based business models will function in the future.\u201d\nOf the partnership with Taipei City,\u00a0IOTA Foundation co-founder\u00a0David S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8 said,\n\u201cIt proves that our next-generation technology is ready for real-world use cases and is more than just a theory.

It\u2019s already in use in homes and across 150 Taipei City elementary schools. The device \u201ccollects and shares air-quality data online,\u201d and it\u2019s moving to Tangle technology. With Tangle, Airbox will \u201cintegrate incentivized payment in IOTA,\u201d perhaps as a reward for maintaining a low carbon footprint.\nAnother smart city focused on the blockchain is Dubai, which reportedly is preparing to unveil nearly two dozen blockchain apps that are currently in pilot form across various agencies ranging from infrastructure to education, to healthcare. Dubai already uses blockchain tech for land registries.\nThe IOTA Coin\nIn addition to the foundation, IOTA is also a top-10 cryptocurrency with a current market cap of $4.8 billion.

These include founders, traditional industry veterans turned ICO participants and everything in-between. The weekly interviews will cover a wide range of questions and try to explore the motivation behind blockchain-based ideas and the problems blockchain technology is being used to solve.\nA more recent trend emerging within the blockchain industry is the use and application of blockchain technology for social and humanitarian needs. The power of the blockchain is that it is essentially is borderless, scalable, and can be implemented across sectors.\nFarmaTrust is one such example. Using blockchain technology, FarmaTrust will disrupt the pharmaceutical supply chain industry, ensuring counterfeit medications are not sold or consumed around the world. From a commercial perspective, their tech stack is highly adaptable and can be immediately used by governments, NGOs, and regulators to help enhance their tracking and supply chain capabilities.\nFarmaTrust\u2019s CEO, Raja Sharif, took time to explain how FarmaTrust was started and provide more details on how they are looking to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry using blockchain technology.\n1. Tell us a little bit about yourself:\n\nI am British, trained as a barrister, and have worked as head of legal for some of the largest international tech and telecoms brands. I worked in Doha Qatar, and before leaving I spent 5 years\u00a0in commercial management, launching digital channels of Al Jazeera.\nI also lived in San Francisco launching AJ+, the most viewed millennial digital channel in the world, and Istanbul to launch Al Jazeera Turk (Digital).\n2. Quite the international background. How did you get involved with blockchain technology?\nSince I am a lawyer, a few years ago I read about \u201csmart contracts\u201d and how lawyers would no longer be required. As I investigated it more and started to become curious about blockchain technologies. I invested in the DOA project to see how the concept would work.\nThen, due to a distant family member being sick overseas, I came across the fact that there were significant counterfeit drugs in circulation. Having done my research, the extent to which can be seen in our whitepaper, thought that blockchain would be the ideal solution to save lives.\n3. What makes FarmaTrust different from competitors, such as Ambrosus?\nFirst, we would like to make it clear that we take a collaborative approach to our business and project. We believe not only is there commercial profit to be made from this system, but it is one of the few companies that is there to service society. After all, we have a strong conviction that our project will save lives.\nWe also believe that the market is of a significant size to accommodate a number of companies (just like all the other commercial sectors). Over time, the companies that innovate and are able to serve the pharmaceutical companies as well as the public will win through.\nIn terms of competitive advantage, we believe we have the following advantages:\n1. We focus on nothing other than the pharmaceutical supply chain. Our system was designed for the pharma industry from the beginning. We understand the regulations that apply, the issues that they face, and we have solutions for the supply chain participants.\n2. Our system does not require any new hardware or software to work with our blockchain product. We are also tech neutral, so it doesn\u2019t matter what systems companies are using.\n3. We can work in the developed and emerging markets. In the developed markets we plug into existing ERP systems. In the emerging markets (where manual paper records are still used) we have a number of different smart phone Apps which can scan labels and collect data for us. We incentivize the pharmacies, hospitals, and warehouses in the emerging world, by giving free accounting and stock control software services, and in return we get data.\n4. Our system can allow for automated payments, automated audits and automated regulatory reporting (our system is regulatory neutral).\n5. Our system provides different data dashboards for different institutions (pharmaceutical, ministries of health, regulators, logistics). Each can be provided with different data consoles. This ensures that there is transparency throughout the SCM.\n6. FarmaTrust can be used to automatically notify law enforcement (eg Interpol) if there are a lot of counterfeits found in a particular area and will help avoid corruption on the black market.\n7. We see ourselves as a data company, so that we when we have enough data, we can use predictive supplies, so that medicines are sent to places where and when they are needed.\n8. We can also use our system to avoid waste for the pharmaceutical industry, through expired drugs, and also avoid returns fraud which is endemic in the pharma industry.\n9. We are also sensor neutral, so we can scan labels, but we can also use environmental sensors to ensure that medicines are kept at the correct temperature \u2013 again, avoiding waste.\n10. Farmatrust is future proof. Since we are system agnostic, and we can use any edge computing sensors, we can innovate quickly and regularly, which ensures our longevity.\n11. Finally, we are the only company which provides the end user with the ability to check the medicines prior to purchase to ensure that they are genuine, ensuring confidence for ecommerce.\n4. What is the biggest problem currently in the pharmaceutical industry?\nCurrently, people are not aware of the size of the problem. It\u2019s a $200 billion counterfeit industry (the total market is worth $1.3 trillion) and between 500,000 and 1 million people die yearly because of fake drugs.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is extremely conservative and innovation on the tech side is seen with some trepidation. This stalls the potential to disrupt the industry, along with a\u00a0significant number of participants in the supply chain mechanism which do not want change\n5. What does 2018 have in store for you guys?\nIn 2018, we will have our first batch of customers who will trial the system. This includes the deployment of our mobile applications and the continued development of our API ecosystem.\n6. What are the 3 most important lessons you could give aspiring blockchain entrepreneurs?\nFirst, research everything you do in depth. Second, be decisive. Third, be determined.", "category": "Feature"}

He made the remarks to CNBC, where he also suggested that things could get worse before they get\u00a0better, pointing to a floor for the bitcoin price of about $8,000 but probably not below $7,500, pointing to \u201cretail money\u201d that\u2019s poured in.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen bitcoin go up, and we\u2019ve seen bitcoin go down. We\u2019ve seen it go down 50% at a time. But it\u2019s quite a resilient currency/commodity/asset that just keeps going up afterward,\u201d said Neu-Ner.\nHe reminded the host about his previous visit a couple of months ago when bitcoin was trading below $8,000 only to spike to nearly $20,000 shortly thereafter.\nDespite his bullish call on bitcoin, Neu-Ner\u2019s money is on Ethereum, which he says is run by \u201cthe smartest people in the world,\u201d in reference to the developers who he recently got to know at a conference held in Cancun.\nHe touts Ethereum for its multiple use cases, ranging from hedging to betting, to voting, for instance, all on the Ethereum network. Meanwhile, bitcoin\u2019s use cases are twofold \u2014 as a currency or a store of value, the latter of which is how Neu-Ner views the cryptocurrency, referencing it as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d\nMeanwhile, he points out it\u2019s only been about a\u00a0year that cryptocurrencies have\u00a0become accessible to the retail investor, and they\u2019ve not even attained wide-scale adoption yet. \u201c2018 is the year where the mechanisms to allow retail consumers to get into cryptocurrencies start to open themselves up,\u201d he said, adding that it will stabilize the price.\nNeu-Ner vs. Roubini: Biggest Bubble Ever?\nAmerican economist and chairman of Roubini Macro Associates, Nouriel Roubini, on the other hand, believes bitcoin is the \u201cbiggest bubble in human history,\u201d one that he told Bloomberg \u201cis finally crashing.\u201d If he\u2019s right, the bitcoin bubble must be greater even than US housing bubble that he forecasted in 2006, two years prior to the sub-prime mortgage crisis. That prediction won him accolades and the nickname Dr.\u00a0 Doom, which he apparently is still making use of today.\u00a0An avid user of Twitter, Roubini often tweets about bitcoin, mostly documenting as he says, \u2018the mother of all crypto bubbles go bust.\u201d\n\nRoubini Says Bitcoin Is the \u2018Biggest Bubble in Human History\u2019https://t.co/J6uFp9raYr\n\u2014 Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) February 2, 2018\n\nIf bitcoin is the\u00a0biggest bubble in human history, it must surpass even the stock market crash of 1929, when investors lost $25 billion, equivalent to hundreds of billions in today\u2019s dollars compared to bitcoin\u2019s present market cap of $150 billion. The Crisis Economics author also likes bitcoin to the internet bubble, tulip mania of the 1600\u2019s and London\u2019s South Sea bubble in the 1700\u2019s \u2014 all of which Roubini says bitcoin surpasses for a bursting bubble.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have both placed a ban on cryptocurrency transactions via credit cards, according to Bloomberg reports. The bitcoin price is holding at about a 5.75% decline, trading at $8,589 in what is shaping up to be a rocky 2018 for cryptocurrency trading so far.\n\nJPMorgan, whose CEO Jamie Dimon famously denounced bitcoin a few months back, doesn\u2019t want to inherit the credit risk given the volatility in the bitcoin price. By speculating on the price of a highly volatile investment like bitcoin, investors are exposing the bank to a higher risk of default, a scenario that may not have been present when the credit was extended in the first place. Meanwhile, banks and regulators are working in tandem to detect signs of fraud, and taking credit cards out of the equation simplifies things somewhat.\nJPMorgan\u2019s ban goes into effect on Saturday, Feb. 3, while Bank of America\u2019s ban became effective immediately, with the bank declining credit card transactions with crypto exchanges, as per internal memos obtained by Bloomberg. While personal and business B-of-A credit cards are included in the ban, the bank will continue to honor all debit card transactions with cards issued by the bank.\nThe move no doubt has investors scrambling, some of whom have automatic buy orders in place at exchanges. And it places an immediate hurdle in bitcoin\u2019s move toward the mainstream, as potential investors who may have been weighing the field now have another hoop to jump through to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies.\nBut by the same token, if what\u2019s going to move bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies forward is investors \u201cnot investing more than they can afford,\u201d than the bank ban becomes less of a hurdle and more of an inconvenience.\nMeanwhile, Chase and B-of-A aren\u2019t the first banks to move on bitcoin. Discover and Capital One already ruled out cryptocurrency charges, while Citi appears to be on the fence.\nBut for Discover\u2019s chief executive David Nelms, there may be some wiggle room. Discover has banned cryptocurrency transactions because the only use cases Nelms is witnessing today are for ransomware and money laundering. But he stopped short of writing bitcoin off, telling Bloomberg that what could inspire a shift is customer demand.\nSo perhaps in this early stage of loose regulation governing the cryptocurrency space, it\u2019s prudent for banks to take a step back so the industry can move forward.\nIn the words of Wences Casares, chief executive of Xapo \u2013\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\n\u00a0", "category": "Banking"}

The Bitcoin price dropped below the $10,000 barrier, while the cryptocurrency market cap entered sub-$500 million territory for the first time since Jan. 17.\nOne token, however, bucked this trend and posted a strong advance against the dollar. Lisk, a blockchain platform that stores decentralized applications in sidechains (as opposed to the main blockchain, as Ethereum does), saw its price soar during intraday trading.\nShortly before 6:00 UTC, the Lisk price was trading at roughly $21.50 on Bittrex.

Other exchanges, including Nasdaq, are reportedly planning to launch cryptocurrency-based futures products as well.\nBoth CBOE and CME consulted with the CFTC before self-certifying the products, but the commission was nevertheless criticized by many market participants \u2014 including the Futures Industry Association \u2014 for not exercising a stricter posture toward these nascent products.\nAt Wednesday\u2019s meeting, which will be chaired by Commissioner Rostin Behnam, the CFTC will review how it approaches the oversight of new products.\n\u201cThe Commission must reconsider its historical regulatory approach to new products,\u201d. Behnam plans to say at Wednesday\u2019s meeting, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nPreviously, CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo acknowledged that the CFTC should eye cryptocurrency derivatives with more scrutiny, and he said the agency has implemented a \u201cheightened review\u201d process that exchanges must undergo before they can launch cryptocurrency derivatives in the future. However, he also said that he hopes \u201cthe market impact of Bitcoin futures\u201d does not \u201ccompromise the product self-certification process that has served so well for so long.\u201d\nThe WSJ report notes that substantially altering the self-certification process would require Congressional action, which is not likely to occur at any point in the near future.\nDespite criticism of the Bitcoin futures roll-out, the markets have operated in an orderly manner, and both exchanges have settled the first round of expiring contracts without incident.\nAt least one top Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee has expressed a desire to strengthen the CFTC\u2019s ability to combat alleged fraud in the Bitcoin markets, but Republicans \u2014 who control all three branches of the federal government \u2014 have resisted calls to expand the authority of regulators.\n\u201cSo far, it appears that the CFTC\u2019s principles-based regulatory standards and the self-certification process have operated as intended,\u201d House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-TX) said. \u201cAt this point it is still early and is unclear what, if anything, needs to be changed to improve the process.\u201d\n\u201cConsidering we are already seeing exciting potential uses for distributed ledger technology in agriculture trade, I am hesitant to encourage the government to look for ways that could potentially stifle further innovation,\u201d added\u00a0Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS).", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

Out of the 100 million Petros Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ordered, about 38.4 million will go to institutional investors in a month-long presale, set to begin March 1. This presale, according to Bloomberg, will be private, obscuring the potential discounts the country offers investors.\nPrevious reports claimed Venezuela would offer institutional investors a discount of up to 60 percent, and a final draft of the Petro whitepaper claims the transactions will be private. After the month-long presale, the Petro will be sold to the public at decreasing discounts, to stimulate early demand.\nThe public sale will see 44 million Petros sold, and will begin after the presale is over. It will feature four levels of small discounts for every 5 million Petros, until a final 24 million tokens are sold at roughly $60 each. Its price is based on the Petro being backed by the country\u2019s oil reserves, although there is no way to trade the Petro for the crude.\nThe rest of the tokens will be held by the Venezuelan Superintendence of Currency. The Petro will be premined, although the whitepaper claims the government may introduce a proof-of-stake model.\nSpeaking on state television, Maduro stated:\n\u201cThis is the moment to accelerate the entry of the Petro, to have faith in what we\u2019ve created, and in the technological and intellectual capacity of our country. The Petro will have a great impact in how we access foreign currencies for the country and in how we obtain goods and services that we need from around the world.\u201d\nVenezuela guarantees it will accept the Petro as payment for taxes and fees. According to the cryptocurrency\u2019s whitepaper, its value in these transactions will \u201cuse as a reference the price of the barrel of the Venezuelan basket of the previous day with a percentage discount.\u201d\nFinally, the token may be incorporated into the \u201ccard of the fatherhood,\u201d a state identification used to claim subsidies and foods from the government.\nAn ERC-20 token\nThe cryptocurrency\u2019s whitepaper notably reveals the Petro will be an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token. Each Petro (ticker: PTR) will be divisible into 100 million parts, with its smallest unit, worth 0.00000001 PTR, being called a \u201cmene.\u201d\nGiven that the Petro is an ERC-20 token, it may end up being listed on decentralized exchanges like EtherDelta or IDEX. Taking into account the Petro is set to be worth about $60 at the time of the token sale, if the hard cap is reached, Venezuela will raise nearly $5 billion, over 5% of Ethereum\u2019s market cap.\nMost of the funds (55 percent) raised through the token sale are set to go to a sovereign fund, while 15 percent will be used to develop technologies in other areas. An additional 15 percent will be used to develop the Petro\u2019s ecosystem, while the final 5 percent will fund the Petro\u2019s development.\n\nThe Venezuelan government is promoting the Petro abroad to developing countries and allied nations, and via the state-owned oil producer Petroleos de Venezuela.\nAs covered by CCN, Venezuela is facing one of the deepest recessions ever seen, and the country\u2019s citizens are currently using cryptocurrencies to survive the government\u2019s failures. Despite cracking down on the space in the past, the country recently eased its stance on cryptocurrency mining.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

Each transaction transferred 100 XEM, worth approximately $77 at the present exchange rate.\nSource: ournem.com\nThat represents a small percentage of the 500 million XEM the hackers raked in during the theft, but it likely indicates that they are attempting to launder the stolen funds.\n\u201cWhen people look to launder these types of funds, they sometimes spread it into smaller transactions because it\u2019s less likely to trigger (exchanges\u2019) anti-money laundering (mechanisms),\u201d Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, a cryptocurrency security firm in London, told Reuters.\nIndeed, while the hackers are sitting on a fortune that is now spread across a variety of addresses, it does them little good unless they can launder the funds into a form that cannot be connected to them.\nAttempting to launder too many tokens at one time will not only place too much downward pressure on the NEM price but could also trigger red flags at cryptocurrency exchanges, who would then most likely freeze the funds and turn them over to authorities.\nThe NEM Foundation, which has been tracking the funds in an attempt to prevent them from being spent or laundered, confirmed that the hackers had attempted to transfer them to cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\u201c[The hackers are] trying to spend them on multiple exchanges. We are contacting those exchanges,\u201d the NEM Foundation Vice President Jeff McDonald said. \u201cI would assume that they are going to get away with some of the money,\u201d he added.\nThe hackers could be using these small transfers to test whether trading platforms will immediately freeze funds sent from an address known to be associated with the theft.\nIf successful, they could then send a larger sum from another address and convert it into a privacy-centric cryptocurrency, such as Monero, which would allow them to shield the latter stages of the laundering process.\nTheir end goal is most likely to convert the funds into Bitcoin, which is by far the most fungible cryptocurrency and can be traded for a wide variety of fiat currencies.\nMany of the hackers\u2019 attempts to launder the funds will probably be thwarted, particularly following an incident that is believed to be the largest cryptocurrency exchange theft in history.

The duo will be joined at the firm by Nic Niedermowwe, an Oxford-trained mathematician, according to a Financial News report.\n\u201cThere are a myriad of issues faced by investors hoping to get into cryptocurrencies,\u201d Niedermowwe told the publication. \u201cMany don\u2019t know how it works, how to install them, how to allocate \u2014 whether they just buy bitcoin or a range of cryptocurrencies \u2014 compliance issues, while storing them securely is a big concern.\u201d\nThe fund aims to achieve \u00a310 million of assets under management (~$14 million), a relatively small amount compared to many cryptocurrency hedge funds. BlockTower Capital, for instance, recently announced that it had raised $140 million, while former Fortress manager Mike Novogratz had planned to launch a $500 million fund before shuttering those plans in favor of opening a crypto-focused merchant bank.\nThough minor in terms of assets under management, however, the creation of Prime Factor Capital is another example of portfolio managers at entrenched firms jumping ship to chase the outsized returns available to skilled cryptocurrency investors.\nThis trend has been exacerbated due to the hesitance of large firms to bet on this burgeoning asset class and outright hostility of some financiers toward its very existence. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, for instance, has called bitcoin an \u201cindex of money laundering,\u201d while Vanguard founder Jack Bogle recently advised investors to \u201cavoid bitcoin like the plague.\u201d\n\u201cThe market is still at an early stage,\u201d concluded Niedermowwe. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for a big institutional asset manager to commit to a new asset class, particularly if they don\u2019t feel the market is there.

We want to make sure that if we choose to enter into the market in terms of providing a future in the market that we, number one, have client demand, and, number two, that we put the right risk management protocols in place to make it so that people feel confidence in what we\u2019re providing and how that becomes an investable product. So we\u2019re still in that exploratory phase of working with our clients right now.\u201d\nPreviously, The Wall Street Journal had reported that the exchange would list bitcoin futures within the first half of the year. While Friedman did not lay out a specific timetable, her remarks cast doubt on whether the products will be released according to that reported roadmap.\nAt the time of writing, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) are the only regulated US exchanges that offer bitcoin futures products. The owner of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has filed to list several bitcoin ETFs, but it has not yet launched its own cryptocurrency futures products.\nNasdaq\u2019s Futures Will Be \u2018More of an Investment\u2019\nOne reason for Nasdaq\u2019s delay in launching these products is that the exchange desires to list a product that is different than those offered by CME and CBOE.\nSpeaking with CNBC, Friedman suggested that Nasdaq\u2019s product might track a spot rate rather than a future price, which she said will allow it to function more like an investment.\n\u201cWhat we might look at is more of a total return futures, so it\u2019s a little bit of a different construct,\u201d she said, adding that it meant it was \u201cmore of an investment than a tracking stock.\u201d\nOf course, Nasdaq and other exchanges looking to list cryptocurrency derivatives may have to jump through a few more regulatory hurdles than CME and CBOE did if they hope to bring their products to market.

Instead,\u00a0Switzerland\u00a0is embracing the culture of cryptocurrencies, as evidenced by a leadership role for the domiciling of upcoming ICOs, as reported in the FT. As home to Crypto Valley, the Swiss version of Silicon Valley located in the canton of Zug and filled with blockchain companies, the country now wants its leadership position to encompass all things crypto.\nSwiss Economics Minister\u00a0Johann Schneider-Ammann at a crypto finance conference\u00a0for private and institutional investors, the first of its kind held in the Swiss Alps earlier this month, said that Switzerland wants to be the \u201ccrypto nation.\u201d He said it with the condition that momentum that has gripped Crypto Valley continues.\nSwitzerland is already an attractive domicile for companies, given its business-friendly regulatory environment and transparency, creating ideal conditions for blockchain startups to come. A propensity for tax evasion among wealthy clients, however, precedes the Alpine country, having tarnished its reputation in the interim. Now policymakers must contend with that reputation when setting the parameters for the Digital Revolution they want to foster.\nBern has created an ICO working group, similar to the approach of the US SEC\u2019s task force, to study the role regulation, as is Swiss\u2019 FINMA. Swiss Finance Minister\u00a0J\u00f6rg Gasser said the market isn\u2019t as \u201cdisciplined\u201d as they would like. They are striving for a \u201cflourishing\u201d ICO market but not at the expense of the standards and integrity of the financial markets.\nIndustry participants come down on both sides of the regulatory argument, with Richard Olsen, founder of blockchain exchange Lykee, suggesting if it\u2019s not broke, there\u2019s no need to fix it, suggesting that ICOs could \u201cself-police,\u201d similar to the sharing economy. But Switzerland is not likely to allow the pendulum to swing too far to that side, with regulatory protocols KYL and AML present.\nAccording to the FT, Switzerland-based ICOs attracted $550 million to their coffers between January and October 2017, compared to $580 million in the United States \u2014 the two top countries for token sales. All told, ICOs last year raised about $4 billion.\nSwiss ICO Appeal\nThe appeal of Switzerland is clear, as evidenced by wealthy local investors coupled with high-quality tech talent. Demand for upcoming ICOs is persisting into 2018, with the Crypto Valley trade group getting up to 10 inquiries daily about doing a Swiss ICO.\nThey are looking to piggyback on the success of some other blockbuster Swiss deals, including blockchain smartphone maker Sirin Labs, a Swiss-Israeli startup that raised more than $157 million in its ICO. Switzerland\u2019s biggest competition may be Gibraltar, with the Gibraltar Stock Exchange doing an ICO.\nNot that there haven\u2019t been any losers, with the Tezos ICO debacle still unfolding after raising $232 million. The latest development being Johann Gevers, head of the Swiss Foundation who has been embroiled in a fight with the Tezos founders, reportedly pledging to resign once the project is moving forward.\nMeanwhile, of the top 10 upcoming ICOs, 40% are domiciled in Switzerland, as per PwC data cited in the FT.", "category": "ICO News"}

Now Johann Gevers, the head of the startup\u2019s Swiss Foundation who is also at the center of the battle with Tezos co-founders Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, is backing down, promising in a blog post entitled \u201cMoving Tezos Forward\u201d to \u201cstep back\u201d from the foundation that controls the Tezos proceeds once the project is moving forward again \u2014 only to confuse matters by removing the post.\nReuters got ahold of it, with the news agency reporting that the ICO funds are no longer frozen, paving the way for Tezos to pay its service providers. Gevers said in the now deleted post:\n\u201cI have consistently communicated \u2026 my intention to step back from the Foundation as soon as things are on track with a new board that is independent and has the support of the Tezos community.\u201d\nGevers confirmed that he removed the blog but said that the plans are still in motion, according to a statement captured by a Reddit user \u2013\n\u201cI was advised to take down this post for prudential reasons. Both I and the Tezos Foundation remain committed to communicating with the community within the constraints imposed on us, and will follow through on the plans outlined in yesterday\u2019s post.\u201d\nGevers chose Medium as the platform for the blog post because the Breitmans\u00a0retain control of the website properties, which is a sign that the turmoil between these parties hasn\u2019t lessened any.\nTezos 2.0\nMeanwhile, Tezos is doing what it can to move forward, and after suffering the defection of board member\u00a0Guido Schmitz-Krummacher has announced\u00a0the appointment of another. Lars Haussmann is taking\u00a0Schmitz-Krummacher\u2019s seat after the latter stepped down amid the battle for control between the Breitmans and Gevers.\nBut the damage has already been done, and swapping out board members adds little solace to buyers of the Tezzie tokens, as they\u2019re called, who were the victims in a stalled project that was at the mercy of bitter infighting. A pair of class-action lawsuits were lodged against the startup, focusing on the company\u2019s failure to register the Tezos token with securities regulators.\nAdding insult to injury, Kathleen Breitman \u2014 while investors were unable to access their funds from the Tezos ICO \u2014 suggested that the bitcoin and Ethereum directed toward the project are considered\u00a0a charitable donation, not an investment, which only infuriated investors more.\nBased on his original blog post, Gevers hopes the Tezos project can pick up where it left off, but whether or not that will materialize will depend not only on the company\u2019s management but also on the Tezos community, who till now have been left out in the cold.", "category": "ICO News"}

I feel the series needs a brief interruption so that we can discuss, yet again, the price; before we move onto different subjects, more technology related.\nSome are calling this correction a complete bloodbath. I\u2019ve read in many places how this has to be connected with\u00a0regulatory scrutiny in eastern Asia: due to heavier restrictions being applied to crypto exchanges and mining companies, people are fleeing the markets.\nHow many times have you read news about China or South Korea or Russia (and so on), imposing heavy restrictions on cryptocurrency?\nHow many times has China banned cryptocurrency trading?\nAnd how often have do you read about the \u2018impending bitcoin bubble\u2018.\nI really don\u2019t see that much of a connection between such news and what\u2019s really happening in the market. We can conclude that, by looking into what\u2019s been happening to volume over the last month or so.\nhttps://www.gdax.com/trade/BTC-USD\nI really don\u2019t notice much of a difference between now and December 2017. Is this really the\u00a0apocalypse, or rather the expected correction we\u2019ve been all waiting for? Most of the selling orders seem to be coming from small investors: people who need to use the money to buy things and people who got scared.\nYes, there are a few spikes, which may be related to institutional investors. There seems to be a correlation between some of those spikes and bitcoin futures settlement dates, that is.\nLet\u2019s see the below example:\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/script/pexmzQ8o-BTC-Futures-Settlement-Dates/\nIf you compare it to the above GDAX graph, look at what happens to bitcoin\u2019s price on settlement days like the 17th or the 23rd. If this isn\u2019t enough today, January 31st is another settlement date. And guess what\u2019s happening!\nIf you ask me personally, although I agree that news may have a huge influence on people\u2019s decisions, usually deep corrections don\u2019t happen due to a single cause. I\u2019ve read on reddit (as many of you I\u2019m sure), in 3 or 4 weeks\u2019 time it\u2019s the Chinese New Year, which could invite people to dump bitcoin for USD.\nI\u2019ve actually done the math myself using coinmarketcap \u00a0prices. And you know what I found? Bitcoin lost between 19% up to almost 40%, from the end of December to the end of January.\nEvery. Single. Damn. Year. \nWant to guess what factor(s) usually perceives this correction?\nA: Bad news!\nB: The Chinese New Year!\nC: People getting scared!\nD: Market manipulation!\nE: All of the above!\nYes, the answer is E)! All of the above reasons seem to contribute to bitcoin\u2019s price drop in January. And that does make sense, as we need to think about how bitcoin works, being the first distributed currency:\n\nIf bitcoin is money controlled by all who own it, then we can argue that \u201ccultural\u201d events (like holidays, for example) can have a far greater impact on the price of bitcoin, than what is expected for fiat-markets.\nMost mining corporations and exchanges are located in Asia, which increases the price fluctuations as when wealthy investors convert bitcoin into USD, the price of bitcoin drops (as expected).\nBitcoin futures settlements affect the price even harder, due to the retraction of the Asian markets. This is, the weight of Wall Street and Institutional investors is even greater.\n\nFor the above reasons we can clearly see that there is an incentive for bitcoin price to drop. Plus, during celebrations like the Chinese New Year\u2019s the amount of money spent by consumers is insane.\u00a0Should we rellay ignore this incentive for people to convert bitcoin into USD?\nThis is a problem that will be gone as soon as people start using bitcoin as money. The need to exchange it for fiat-currency disappears, as most accept bitcoin.\n4. People tend to react negatively to bad news (especially about bitcoin). So when traditional market investors or media channels release news about the bitcoin\u2019s \u201cdoomsday\u201d and terrible effects of regulation, people get scared. And what do you do when you get scared? You sell like crazy (to avoid bigger losses).\nBut every storm has its purpose.\nDo you know what I really like about this one in particular?

Skittish investors fled KODK, as the stock tumbled 13% after gaining 200%-plus when the KodakCoin ICO was announced.\nThe delay comes on the heels of a couple of critical reports, most notably from The New York Times questioning the vetting practices of the nostalgic brand.\u00a0The Times suggests that Kodak\u2019s push into cryptocurrencies, for which it is betting its comeback, is one fraught with questionable decisions, most notably its business partners, including\u00a0 \u201ca paparazzi photo agency, a penny-stock promoter and a company offering what has been called a \u201cmagic money-making machine.'\u201d\nBull\u2019s Eye\nPublicly traded Kodak, which only a few years ago filed for bankruptcy protection, must have known it would have a target on its back even though it registered its token as a security given the hard-line regulators have taken on cryptocurrencies and ICOs of late. SEC chairman Jay Clayton in\u00a0a Jan. 22 speech called out public companies that \u201cshifted their business models to capitalize on the perceived promise of distributed ledger technology,\u201d and might as well just have mentioned Kodak by name.\nMeanwhile, for all its controversy, KodakCoin is a much-anticipated project among photographers as it solves an industrywide problem for them. By using distributed ledger technology, photogs can register their prints and then proceed to license them out, paving the way for them to be paid for their work and catch anyone who violates the copyright.\nKodak chief Jeff Clarke told the Times it was this disconnect in the photography industry that led him to blockchain technology in the first place.\n\u201cThis is not a dog food company that\u2019s creating a currency. This is a real solution around digital rights that Kodak has been involved in for many years,\u201d he told the Times.\nThe KodakCoin ICO is targeting accredited investors across the United States, Canada and the UK, as per early reports.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the lead advisor that Kodak engaged for the blockchain project is sure to raise some more red flags among regulators. Cameron Chell was banned from the Alberta Stock Exchange for half a decade in the late nineties and fined $25,000 for rules violations. Prior to that, one of Mr. Chell\u2019s companies closed its doors amid fraud allegations tied to its chairman.\nNot the first impression Kodak wants to give to regulators, or investors for that matter.", "category": "ICO News"}

At the time of publishing, data from Blockchain.info shows BTCC\u2019s mining pool accounting for 2.8% of total bitcoin hash rate.\nBTCC, along with the rest of China\u2019s bitcoin startups, first saw scrutiny by authorities in January 2017 after central bank officials performed on-site visits at multiple domestic exchanges. This led to BTCC suspending user withdrawals of bitcoin in mid-February before eventually lifting the blockade in June. In mid-September, Chinese authorities mandated a shutdown of bitcoin exchanges, spurring BTCC to suspend trading immediately before ultimately shutting shop on September 30, 2017.\nAfter its forceful removal from its home nation, BTCC has since relocated its headquarters from Shanghai to London.", "category": "Bitcoin Companies"}

In an attempt to predict bitcoin\u2019s price at the end of this decade, McAfee had previously stated that it would reach \u201c$500,000 by the end of 2020\u201d. In November 2017, he tweeted that the cryptocurrency had accelerated much faster than expected, causing him to raise his prediction to $1 million instead.\nMcAfee\u2019s bitcoin prediction is not all that he has stated in his tweets though. He has claimed that if bitcoin does not reach his price target by the end of 2020, he will proceed to \u201ceat his d**k on national television.\u201d While it is obviously near impossible that any televised network will allow such a demonstration on air, McAfee is perhaps trying to instill greater confidence in his prediction. That said, most people, including some diehard cryptocurrency enthusiasts, have derided his bold claims.\nAccording to McAfee, his \u201cprediction model\u201d had only forecast bitcoin reaching $5000 by the end of 2017. The reality, however, panned out to be quite deviant from his model, with the digital currency finding itself at an all-time high peak of close to $20,000 in December 2017. Bitcoin, along with the entire cryptocurrency market, has been on a steady decline since reaching that peak, with the cumulative market cap at least 40% lower than what it was a month ago, at least as of the time of writing this article two months later. Naturally, this has prompted people to question McAfee\u2019s prophecy for the future. If bitcoin were to hit $1 million by 2020, it would have to appreciate a hundred times from its current valuation.\nJohn McAfee recently ended his role as the chief cybersecurity visionary at MGT Capital Investments. The company not only has a significant stake in hydro-powered bitcoin mining, but has also been working with blockchain technology to develop security-related products.\nInterestingly, McAfee has been a rather strong proponent of the bitcoin fork, Bitcoin Cash (BCH). He even alluded to the two cryptocurrencies potentially battling it out for the top position sometime in the future. Most Bitcoin Cash supporters believe that the original bitcoin is too bloated and unusable as a currency or substitute for cash, thus necessitating the fork. McAfee not only believes that BCH is a possible cash-based payment system, but also that it may dethrone bitcoin as the de facto cryptocurrency. That said, his BCH vision surprisingly does not jeopardize the one in which bitcoin reaches $1 million within the next couple of years.\nIt remains to be seen whether bitcoin will once again retrace its steps back to the all-time high established back in December 2017. While past performance is no indicator of the future, it is very likely that the entire digital currency market will recover sooner or later as it always has. Once that happens though, one can only speculate whether McAfee\u2019s audacious price target is attainable or not.", "category": "Bitcoin Announcements"}

The weekly purchase limit is $10,000 (there is no limit on sales), but investors who are placing orders larger than this are likely doing so through services that offer more features anyway. As the service will likely attract many first-time Bitcoin buyers, funds remain in Square\u2019s custody, although you can withdraw them to a personal wallet after performing minimal know-your-customer (KYC) verification.\nIt is not immediately clear what measures Square has taken to secure customer funds, which you should keep in mind if you are considering holding a large balance through the app.\nFinally, Bitcoin has not yet been integrated into the Cash App\u2019s core functionality, which is to seamlessly send payments to other users of the app, and Square has not stated whether it intends to add this feature at a later date.", "category": "Accepts Bitcoin"}

Analysts have demonstrated their concerns towards Ripple specifically, as it fell below the $1 mark for the second time in two weeks.\nSimilar to how the $10,000 mark is a psychological threshold for most bitcoin investors, the $1 mark represents a similar threshold for Ripple or XRP investors. While the price of Ripple has rebounded after dropping below $1, it is important to acknowledge that the price of XRP has fallen below $1 twice within the past 2 weeks.\nOther cryptocurrencies have also struggled to show any signs of short-term recovery. Bitcoin Cash and Cardano have remained stagnant for weeks, maintaining their positions as the fourth and fifth most valuable cryptocurrencies in the market. While the two cryptocurrencies have fallen significantly in the past week, other cryptocurrencies have moved in a similar trend.\nOn a monthly basis, the entire cryptocurrency market has declined by $120 billion, from $590 to $470 billion. Usually, even after major corrections, the market tend to record gains in the mid-term, often on a monthly basis or a quarterly basis. The past month has been a slump for the cryptocurrency market and based on the daily trading volume, overall interest, and momentum indicators, it seems unlikely that the cryptocurrency market will increase by a large margin in the short-term.\nIn summation, while it is a viable time for newcomers to enter the cryptocurrency market, it is not particularly the best period to invest in the market. If the market shows some signs of recovery in the short-term, then it would be an option to invest but at this moment, it is most important to diversify assets and minimize risk.\nWhat Triggered the Slump?\nThe cryptocurrency market was hit with a series of negative news and developments. Some regions are still recovering from trading ban FUD initiated by the South Korean government and most recently, the Indian government.\nAlso, the cryptocurrency market was mostly composed of speculators and casula investors eyeing short-term profits. As the price of most cryptocurrencies declined, speculators left the market. This could be evaluated as a positive long-term development as the market can shake off weak hands and strengthen. But, in the short-term, it could lead to major losses for existing investors.\nMany investors have become concerned with taxation policies of certain regions and markets, the state of regulations in countries like India, and the long-term growth trend of the cryptocurrency market. \nThe cryptocurrency market is down by around 40 percent from its all-time high. Fundamentally, when any market falls by more than 40 percent, it presents strong buy opportunities for outsiders. The cryptocurrency market could recover as a new wave of buyers enter the space but until then, the market could struggle to recover.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

Lee, who is an alum of both Google and Coinbase, spoke about the speculative nature of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency investing, saying that it\u2019s not \u201cbad\u201d but instead a \u201cnatural progression,\u201d adding that he sees nothing wrong with it.\nBut Lee, who himself has had to fight off rumors of manipulating the price of Litecoin, pointed to pervasive scams in which participants are just in it for a quick buck. Lee is quoted as saying:\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite easy for a founder to pump a coin and make it seem like it\u2019s the latest and greatest and it will cure world hunger, and the price can go up to $10 billion.\u00a0And it\u2019s easy for whoever did that to cash out.\u201d\nAs a result, people will lose money, he warned, which saddens him. Lee also pointed to the rush of ICOs, many of which are behind white papers comprised of fancy tech jargon, promising the world and raising hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. \u201cThese coins will likely just go to zero,\u201d he said.\nFellow blockchain veteran Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum recently pointed to the social good that is inherent in the genesis of blockchain and what the \u201ccrypto community\u201d should be focused on. Like Buterin, Lee would like to see a shift in the focus to technology and advancing the industry.\nLee in December sold his entire Litecoin portfolio, with the exception of a handful of \u201ccollectibles,\u201d to prevent what he said could be construed as a \u201cconflict of interest.\u201d\nBlockchain Pioneers Echo the Sentiment\nLee is not the first cryptocurrency pioneer to call out the rise of scams in the space, including upcoming ICOs. Ethereum\u2019s Buterin has similarly railed against the\u00a0unscrupulous activity, most recently lauding the efforts of one Reddit user for publicly questioning an upcoming ICO\u2019s claims of having a Buterin association,\u00a0in response to which\u00a0Buterin tweeted: \u201cThis is exactly the correct way to react to an ICO claiming my involvement.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Fellow Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin echoed those sentiments, having recently told CNBC\u00a0that many upcoming ICOs that fit the bill as \u201ccopycat\u201d projects, with no intentions of providing value to investors. Ripple chief Brad Garlinghouse went so far as to say that much of what\u2019s unfolding among ICOs is fraud.\nLitecoin & Bitcoin\nMeanwhile, fraud wasn\u2019t the only topic of discussion highlighted in the Business Insider article.\u00a0Lee created Litecoin in 2011 in many ways to improve upon bitcoin, with a focus on greater scalability and speed. Litecoin, however, appears to be more a rival to XRP than it is to bitcoin.\n\u201cSo my vision for litecoin has always been to complement bitcoin \u2014 to be the payments currency. Where bitcoin would be digital gold, litecoin would be silver. It\u2019s more useful for payments. And bitcoin would be better for store of value,\u201d he said.\nHe goes on to point out, however, that Litecoin is 4x faster than bitcoin for transactions. But thanks to a different POW algorithm, cryptocurrency miners can\u2019t mine both coins, which removes a facet of the competition.\nHe points to the Lightning Network as the underlying technology that will advance the payments sector, adding that it\u2019s not a panacea and won\u2019t combat high fees tied to bitcoin. \u201cSo litecoin I think can find its own niche to help address payment fees,\u201d said Lee.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

BitcoinBro CEO\u00a0Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie told Bloomberg that despite bitcoin shedding nearly 50% of its value in the past four weeks, he\u2019s not worried. Instead, he pointed to \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d saying that he remains \u201cvery bullish over the long term, seeming to suggest that in the end, the cryptocurrency market will be better for it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a healthy correction. It\u2019s a sign that the market is growing up. It\u2019s recognizing that cryptocurrencies are not a tool for money laundering or illicit use,\u201d he said.\n\nKYC / AML\nPart of the reason for the pullback, the BitcoinBro chief said, has been the regulatory environment, pointing to South Korea, for example. South Korean regulators uncovered $600 million in illicit trades in cryptocurrencies, even as the country is\u00a0crafting\u00a0regulation for cryptocurrency exchanges. South Korea has been instrumental in the rise of bitcoin and other digital coins,\u00a0comprising about one-fifth of cryptocurrency trading activity across 12-plus exchanges in the country.\nBut their steps toward a more regulated cryptocurrency industry, more specifically KYC and AML protocols, are moving bitcoin forward,\u00a0von Landsberg-Sadie said, not backward, despite the toll it\u2019s taken on the bitcoin price.\nWhile the bitcoin price is getting punished amid the regulatory clampdown,\u00a0von Landsberg-Sadie pointed out that bitcoin itself is not a proper choice for money laundering activities, despite what critics think. If you recall, BlackRock\u2019s CEO Larry Fink famously said that bitcoin was a reflection of the \u201cdemand for money laundering \u2026 in the world.\u201d\nMeanwhile,\u00a0von Landsberg-Sadie said bitcoin is a \u201cterrible choice\u201d for hackers such as Wanna Cry ransomware attacks because the funds are traceable along the blockchain. More privacy-focused coins such as Monero or Zcash, for example, have the anonymity feature in money laundering, but not bitcoin.\nOne of BitcoinBro\u2019s own clients who had bitcoin stolen and said the funds were \u201ceasy to trace\u201d back to the wallet.\n\u201cThe on ramps and off ramps key points. How is a money launderer actually going to convert that money into something useful today. They\u2019re going to need an off ramp like an exchange. But now that regulation is stepping and those exchanges are locking down on knowing their customer and having the proper money laundering controls, it\u2019s a use case that will dwindle.\u201d \u2014\u00a0 von Landsberg-Sadie\n\u00a0\nBiggest Buying Opp of the Year?\nMeanwhile, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee in recent weeks suggested putting in a buy order for bitcoin at $9,000, as the low presented \u201cthe biggest buying opportunity in 2018.\u201d He has a $25,000 price target on bitcoin in 2018 and has been known to revise those forecasts to the upside.\nSomething to keep in mind is that the bitcoin price is still trading higher by approximately 800% since January 2017 \u2013", "category": "Bitcoin Price News"}

Now the West African country\u2019s policymakers want to examine the digital coin to determine whether or not it has a place in the Nigerian\u00a0economy, as per a report in Bloomberg. The concerns surfaced during a Senate session earlier this week in Abuja in which bitcoin took center stage.\nAfrican millennials are especially keen on bitcoin, as per the BBC, including in Lagos, where bitcoin is looked to not only as a form of investment but also as a means to remit payments cross-border. But it may soon be tougher for them to do so.\nAccording to Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu, the Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and Other Financial Institutions will launch an investigation into \u201cthe viability of bitcoin as a form of investment, come up with recommendations on how to control its uses and trade.\u201d\nIt\u2019s to the dismay of some policymakers that bitcoin\u2019s traded in Nigeria amid what\u00a0Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu described in a motion as investors being \u201cpersuaded\u201d of quick returns.\nThe Nigerian Senate is joining the chorus of the country\u2019s central bank, the head of which told said in recent days to Bloomberg that trading bitcoin was akin to gambling, saying that the Central Bank of Nigeria couldn\u2019t support such risky behavior.\nCaution has been the tone of Nigerian policymakers since a year\u00a0ago, when the central bank approached lenders amid\u00a0the bitcoin price volatility and\u00a0propensity\u00a0for money\u00a0laundering. They appear to be digital-coin agnostic, having cautioned that bitcoin, Monero, Litecoin and other altcoins are not recognized as legal tender in the country and therefore any transactions are done so at the risk of the bank.\nThe CBN even approached lenders, requesting they steer clear of digital coins before \u201csubstantive regulation and/or decision\u201d by policymakers. The time appears to have come, as the Senate plans to give its recommendations within a couple of weeks.\nAn Affinity for Bitcoin\nWithout formal regulation till now, traders have taken to forming their own clusters to implement standards for bitcoin trading. They had to do something, given their affinity for trading the digital coin coupled with the widespread fraud that had gripped the nation and took Nigerians for millions of dollars. This hit hard in a nation whose per-capita yearly income falls below $3,000.\nSo the traders reportedly took to messaging app Telegram and created their own Know-Your-Customer (KYC) protocols, so to speak, in which interested parties are vetted, sometimes face-to-face, before joining the group, which has since ballooned to some 800 members.\nMeanwhile, the fate of bitcoin trading in Nigeria is out of their hands.", "category": "Bitcoin Politics"}

Per the publication, the bank has recently started blocking transactions from various cryptocurrency exchanges, claiming these exchanges are transacting in non-regulated financial products.\nIn an email the bank sent to a client who complained he couldn\u2019t transfer funds from the San-Francisco based exchange Coinbase to his bank account, the bank stated that Coinbase is an entity dedicated to buying and selling digital currencies, and that Santander Totta doesn\u2019t transact operations related to unregulated digital currencies, meaning the clients\u2019 transactions would never go through.\nAccording to ECO, a who client managed to speak with a bank employee through a personalized service dubbed \u201cSuperlinha\u201d claims the employee confirmed the existence of an internal directive to block transfers using Coinbase\u2019s IBAN. On social media, the issue has seemingly been initially brought up near the end of 2017, a few days before Christmas. In response, various users simply changed banks.\nCoinbase isn\u2019t the only platform Santander Totta is refusing to process transactions from. Earlier this week, a Facebook user revealed that Bitstamp wasn\u2019t an option for Santander Totta\u2019s clients, as Bitstamp informed him that the bank wasn\u2019t processing transactions that \u201coriginate from bitcoin-related businesses.\u201d\n\nThe blockade doesn\u2019t seem to be complete, however, as various reportedly manage to send and receive funds from other cryptocurrency exchanges such as Kraken. Others, in an attempt to bypass Santader Totta\u2019s move, have been omitting the recipient\u2019s name when transferring the funds. Notably, Santander Totta reportedly processes transaction in Ripple\u2019s XRP token.\nAs reported by CCN, Portugal\u2019s central bank, Bank of Portugal, has in the past stated that bitcoin has no legal tender in the country, nor a central authority controlling it. Nevertheless, there are several digital currency organizations in the European Union the financial regulator authorizes, and Coinbase is one of them.\nIn an attempt to know more, ECO contacted the central bank, which didn\u2019t address Santander Totta\u2019s blockade, but instead just restated that bitcoin has no central authority controlling it, and that, given the lack of regulations, no cryptocurrency-related business has to register with the financial institution.\nA few banks in the country, including Banco CTT, Caixa Geral de Dep\u00f3sitos, and Novo Banco revealed potential clients can use their services to transfer to and from regulated cryptocurrency exchanges.\nOthers, including Montepio and BPI, refused to comment, although various users claim no transactions are blocked. As reported by CCN, Portugal is a country that wants to tax bitcoin users despite a lack of regulations, and in which the Securities Market Commission (CMVM) is supervising banks and brokerages on the \u201cbitcoin euphoria.\u201d\nLast year, Bank of Portugal issued a warning against OneCoin, the purported altcoin scheme widely seen as a scam The country\u2019s Finance Minister and Eurogroup president M\u00e1rio Centeno, as reported, has stated he is confident regulators are overseeing bitcoin\u2019s impact.", "category": "Banking"}

Fortunately, Gevers published a blog post via Medium saying he intends to step away from Tezos.\nGevers has since taken down the post. However, a subsequent statement confirmed that he\u2019ll stick to the plan. It seems even whenever Gevers strives to provide the community with clarity, he fails.\nGevers has struggled to make friends in the Tezos community since October. A report from Reuters outlines several disagreements between Gevers and Arthur and Kathleen Breitman. The husband and wife tandem are the leaders of Tezos\u2019 Development team and the corporation behind the project, Dynamic Ledger Solutions.\nDespite the fallout, Arthur Breitman maintains that the beta version of the Tezos blockchain could launch within the next five weeks if impending legal issues can be resolved sooner rather than later. He also confirms development of the project is progressing considerably. This despite the fact developers are waiting to receive adequate compensation from the Gevers-led foundation.\nT2 Foundation Comes In Peace\nThe T2 foundation will feature seven board members, including Jasperson, who spent an estimated $50,000 of his own money to launch the T2 Foundation and the Swiss association, The Association for the Tezos Protocol and Ecosystem.\nAlso joining the board is Olaf Carlson-Wee, head of cryptocurrency hedge fund Polychain Capital.

One Google report pegged a group of extortionists making $25 million in two years. Now, at least one Tor proxy service is trying to get its cut, as it was caught diverting victims\u2019 payments to its own wallets.\nRansomware extortionists ask their victims to pay in bitcoin, and to use the deep web so they can escape authorities. When a ransomware victim doesn\u2019t want to or isn\u2019t able to install the Tor browser, used to access the deep web\u2019s .onion domains, operators ask them to use a Tor proxy, such as onion.top or onion.to.\nTor proxy services allow users to access .onion websitse using a regular browser such as Google Chrome, Edge, or Firefox, simply by adding the .top or .to extension to the end of any Tor URL. These services have been getting increasingly popular among ransomware authors. So much so, a few strains even added alternative URLs to help victims pay using these services.\nAccording to cybersecurity firm Proofpoint, at least one of these services, onion.top, was caught replacing the ransomware\u2019s bitcoin payment address with its own. Per the researchers, the service was secretly doing this, and has seemingly netted over $22,000 from the move.\nResearchers discovered onion.top was doing this after noticing a ransomware strain dubbed LockeR warned users not to use the service as it was stealing its bitcoin. The warning reads:\n\u201cDo NOT use onion.top, they are replacing the bitcoin address with their own and stealing bitcoins. To be sure you\u2019re paying to the correct address, use Tor Browser.\u201d\nOnion.top is altering bitcoin wallet addresses of at least three different ransomware strains: LockeR, Sigma, and GlobeImposter. The wallets are seemingly manually configured, on a per-site basis. The low amount earned suggests that the move either wasn\u2019t that successful, or that wallets aren\u2019t always replaced.\nRansomware Authors are Countering the Move\nAccording to reports, the authors behind affected ransomware strains are countering onion.top\u2019s move in a variety of ways. Most are simply trying to get users to skip Tor proxy services altogether, and just pay using the Tor browser. Others, such as MagniBer, decided to split the bitcoin payment address shown to the victim across different HTML tags, to avoid automatic replacement.\nVictims who decide to pay the ransom and end up sending their funds to the Tor proxy service aren\u2019t paying the ransomware extortionists, and won\u2019t likely see their files decrypted as, in the extortionist\u2019s eyes, the ransom was never paid.\nProofpoint\u2019s researchers stated:\n\u201cWhile this is not necessarily a bad thing, it does raise an interesting business problem for ransomware threat actors and practical issues for ransomware victims.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Crime"}

A side note \u2013 India\u2019s tax authorities are, in fact, using the help of cryptocurrency exchanges to chase tax evaders.\nHowever, the immediate aftermath of Jaitley\u2019s remark sparked a torrent of erroneous reporting from India\u2019s national press and mainstream media outlets about the Indian government outlawing and banning cryptocurrencies.\n\u201cArun Jaitley has just killed India\u2019s cryptocurrency party,\u201d screamed a headline from Quartz India, one of the earliest mainstream publications to report on the finance minister\u2019s statement. \u2018It appears to be the end of the road for cryptocurrencies in India\u2019, read the introduction to the article with the rest following in a similar tone.\nA prominent news anchor for a major TV news channel watched by tens of millions of viewers wrote: \u201cBitcoin to be banned.

That has since been amended to \u201cIndia Just Caused the Price of Bitcoin to Slide Again.\u201d\nNo Ban. Repeat: No Ban!\nAs CCN stressed yesterday, none of the above rings true. To be precise, Jaitley spoke of a crackdown on the abuse of cryptocurrencies in illegal activities as well as their use as a method of payment.\nIndeed, in an interview with Indian state-owned broadcaster Doordarshan following his national budget delivery, Jaitley was explicitly asked if the government was moving to ban cryptocurrencies.\nA direct translation of the exchange reads:\nTV Host: We\u2019ve seen a lot of excitement over bitcoins. Why aren\u2019t you banning it instead of stating it isn\u2019t legal tender?\nJaitley: We are discouraging people from using it now. There is a government committee that\u2019s looking into it right now and they will announce their decisions and next steps after they are done.\nStill, no ban. The reference to the government committee is the long-established \u201cVirtual Currency Committee\u2019, an inter-disciplinary committee comprising of representatives from a number of ministries as well as those from the central bank and India\u2019s biggest bank (also state-owned) tasked toward proposing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in India.

Prior to the January 11 correction, the market valuation of Ripple remained below $67 billion. The partnership between Ripple and MoneyGram added a staggering $13 billion to Ripple\u2019s market valuation, allowing RIpple to recover to its previous levels.\nSince CoinMarketCap had removed the trading prices of the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market, the price and the market cap of Ripple have struggled to recover. From $147 billion, within one week, the Ripple network\u2019s market valuation fell by over $67 billion, an unprecedented drop in market cap in the cryptocurrency market. \nIn late December, Ripple had demonstrated a meteoric rise in value, overtaking the Ethereum network in market valuation and appealing to the South Korean exchange market with its cheap tokens. Regardless of the market valuation, which is the accurate depiction of the value of a cryptocurrency, casual traders and newcomers tend to consider the price of the cryptocurrency more than the market cap.\nDemand for Ripple Still High\nThus, for the majority of investors that are new to the space, a $3 token of XRP seems substantially cheaper than the $300 Litecoin, even if the Ripple network is significnatly larger than Litecoin by market cap. The advantage of having cheap tokens led the South Korean exchange market to drive the price of XRP up by massive margins.\nIn the South Korean exchange market, regardless of the recent cryptocurrency trading ban fiasco, XRP is being traded at nearly $3. The demand for Ripple has increased over the past two days, largely triggered by the long-term plan of MoneyGram to utilize XRPs in processing international payments.\nClick here for a real-time Ripple price chart.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

The bill proposes using bitcoin to pay state income taxes, and it was submitted by Senators Warren Petersen and David Farnsworth as well as Reps. Travis Grantham and Jeff Weninger, all of whom are Republicans.\nSB 1091, whose short title is \u201cincome tax payments; bitcoin,\u201d was introduced on in recent days. While the bill is specific to the state of Arizona, if it takes off, there could be a push for federal adoption of a similar policy.\nIn addition to paying the old-fashioned way, by check, the bill suggests:\n\u201cA payment gateway, such as bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, using electronic peer-to-peer systems. The Department shall convert cryptocurrency payments to\u00a0US dollars at the prevailing rate within 24 hours after receipt and shall credit the taxpayer\u2019s account with the converted dollar amount.\u201d\nThe risk of doing so, of course, is tied to the volatility in the bitcoin price. For instance, the bitcoin price in 2017 ranged from $1,000 at the start of the year, to nearly $20,000 before finishing year-end at around $13,000.\nIndeed, bitcoin surged by \u201cquadruple digits\u201d in 2017, and as long as it continues to do so will work in the state of Arizona\u2019s favor. But in the event of a correction, that exposes the state to possibly getting the short-end of the stick, unless they have some hedging features integrated into the payments system, which is the approach taken by blockchain-based P2P lender Salt Lending.\nArizona is not the maiden US state to pursue the use of cryptocurrencies for tax payments. Last year at about this time, New Hampshire policymakers submitted a similar bill designed to allow the use of bitcoin to pay taxes. That bill never saw the light of day, however, after overwhelmingly getting shot down. Policymakers took one year-plus to vote on the predecessor bill, and if it takes that long for the latest attempt the bitcoin price could be in a different stratosphere.\nMeanwhile, Arizona is somewhat progressive when it comes to new technology. Governor Doug Ducey, for instance, supports a sharing economy,\u00a0even taking a spin in a Google self-driving car. He also signed a law in 2016 supporting blockchain and smart contracts for sales, leases, etc., perhaps seemingly setting the stage for a deeper push into cryptocurrencies.\u00a0Nevada, meanwhile, \u201crecognizes blockchain and smart contract technologies,\u201d they were also the maiden state to \u201cban local governments from taxing blockchain use.\u201d\nEach state will likely take its own stance on cryptocurrencies, and more bills similar to the Arizona one could surface throughout the year, with the possible amalgamation of such policies being introduced at the federal level, someday.", "category": "Bitcoin Economics"}

Cryptocurrencies like Zcash, Qtum, Monero, and EOS that have nearly 50 percent of their daily trading volumes processed on South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges have increased significantly in value.\nIn the South Korean market, EOS has gained popularity due to its relatively cheap tokens and Ethereum-like ecosystem. Built on top of the Ethereum protocol, EOS powers decentralized applications with a flexible and scalable network. Each EOS token is worth about $11, which is substantially lower than that of Ethereum\u2019s Ether, which is valued at $1,260.\nNewcomers and beginner traders in the cryptocurrency exchange market often tend to evaluate the potential growth capacity of cryptocurrencies based on their price, not market cap. For instance, many investors in the South Korean market believe that Litecoin is worth more than Ripple, because Litecoin costs more than $250, while Ripple costs less than $3.\n\u201cFor new investors in crypto, think in market cap. Not price per coin. Market cap gives an estimate of the potential growth. Price per coin doesn\u2019t mean anything as the supply for each altcoin differs. $0.1 per coin doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s cheap. $100 per coin doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s expensive,\u201d explained cryptocurrency trader Squeeze.\nBut, the vast majority of investors in emerging markets like South Korea still have not grasped the concept of market valuation and evaluate cryptocurrencies based on the price of individual tokens. As such, the popularity of EOS increased in South Korea because it functions and operates similarly as Ethereum and Cardano but is cheaper in price.\nCurrently, Bithumb, the second largest cryptocurrency exchange in the global market based in Seoul, is processing $1.3 billion worth of EOS, as the second most traded cryptocurrency in the South Korean market. The EOS trading volume on Bithumb is larger than bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Monero, Dash, and Zcash combined.\nShort-Term Trend\nIn the short-term, cryptocurrencies with a strong consumer base in South Korea such as Monero, EOS, ZCash, Qtum, Ripple, and Ethereum will likely surge in value, as the entire cryptocurrency market recovers from the recent correction.\nRipple and Ethereum have also large communities and followers in the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market, which has been driving the price of most of the abovementioned cryptocurrencies up over the past several months.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

The market soon started to recover, after the South Korea Ministry of Strategy and Finance came forward and stated that it does not support nor agree with the Ministry of Justice\u2019s ban proposal.\nAny draft legislation would require the parliament\u2019s approval, which could take months to happen. Moreover, the timing seems odd at best, with local elections upcoming this year. Cryptocurrencies are popular in South Korea, so much so that a petition opposing the potential ban already gathered nearly 100,000 signatures.\nSeveral South Korean opposition parties, according to local news outlet Hani, took advantage of the trading ban fiasco, by pointing out that instead of cracking down on cryptocurrency exchanges, regulations should be drafted, and that there should be \u201cdetailed review and coordination\u201d on the subject.\nA spokesperson for an opposition party notably pointed out that a lot of people lost money because of the government\u2019s announcement. The spokesperson said (roughly translated):\n\u201cThe government announcement should be based on detailed reviews and coordination. If there is a problem, we should warn and prepare in advance, the behavior we showed today was the opposite.\u201d\nThe spokesperson further added that if there is the possibility of tax evasion through cryptocurrency trading, that possibility should be discussed so as to arrange a \u201ctaxation plan as soon as possible,\u201d similarly implying a ban on cryptocurrency exchanges isn\u2019t the right move.\nPer the opposition party, the fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) spread by the South Korean Ministry of Justice unfairly punished local investors and effectively turned them into \u201cgamblers\u201d in what it deemed a policy of seclusion.\nTaking into account that \u201ca lot of people\u2019s property has evaporated,\u201d the spokesperson added that president Moon Jae-in should \u201capologize to the people and take appropriate measures.\u201d Given the backlash, that saw petitions being filed and opposition parties rally against the move, South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Justice softened its stance on the ban proposal to an extent.\nSouth Korea\u2019s primary financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), is unlikely to support a ban, as it has long insisted on introducing regulations that will see cryptocurrency exchanges be granted licenses.

Mark Zuckerberg argued in a recent statement that the people once believed in the decentralized nature of technology. Over the years, they\u2019ve lost faith because governments are now using it to manipulate the masses. \n\u201cCryptocurrency takes power from centralized systems and puts it back into the hands of its rightful owners \u2013 the people\u201d, said Zuckerberg in a post on Facebook. Bitcoin is risky because it\u2019s difficult to keep under control, although at the core of the crypto world lies a purpose: the ability of cryptocurrency to reconstruct financial systems leveraging transparency and eliminating the dire need to trust; and when there\u2019s no reason to doubt there\u2019s no chance for deceit or fraud. \nHigh-level security, transparency and trust are three of the main benefits that Blockchain technology and Bitcoin can provide, and the democratization of money seems to be the greatest financial revolution of the century. Regardless, governments around the world are trying to make Bitcoin a pariah of society. Illegal trades, cybersecurity breaches, volatility, and ICO scams have persuaded countries like South Korea to regulate Bitcoin. \nAs cryptocurrency falls under government scrutiny in Asia, Europe seems to be on the verge of building a crypto-based empire. Countries like Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, and UK see the good in cryptocurrency, the influence it holds, and, ultimately, the power it has to disrupt centralized governments and revolutionize financial systems. \nBitcoin \u2013 a Great Friend but an Even Greater Foe\nBig governments around the world are catching up with the cryptocurrency craze. Apparently, they\u2019re on a hunt for blood. After announcing the ICOs are greatly influencing financial and economic order in China, the government banned all forms of ICO funding. It happened in October 2017, with bitcoin losing nearly 10%, Litecoin 24.92% and Ethereum 21.74%. In Venezuela, the government has began locking up Bitcoin miners, although because of the severe financial crisis, cryptocurrency might actually help overcome a complete financial blockage.\nPreviously the head of the state Nicholas Maduro has said Venezuela would issue 100 million tokens, each backed by the equivalent of one barrel of Venezuelan oil. This will make the entire value of tokens a little over $6 billion. The pre-sale is about to start on February 20th, but critics strongly doubt that such measure could pull the country out of the economic crisis. Besides, some consider it illegal. \nAs far as South Korea is concerned, which is also one of the most popular Bitcoin markets in the world \u2013 the ban on anonymous cryptocurrency trading has just been enforced. \nThe overall crypto market is challenged by Asian regulations, and as of January 30 South Korea Financial Services Commission enabled a set of rules that allegedly are meant to reduce illegal cryptocurrency activities, such as \u201cmoney laundering, crimes, and tax evasion.\u201d The new terms and conditions imposed challenge the status quo of cryptocurrency, which is anonymity. All traders will have to link their crypto exchange accounts to their bank accounts using their real names. \nThe South Korean situation with the crypto market is, at the very least, complicated. At first, the government\u2019s intention was to ban crypto trading entirely. But the Korean people reacted and filed a petition to fight than. They called it a \u201chappy dream\u201d, and its intention was to compel officials to declare their crypto assets. After dealing with several pain points related to privacy failure, several Korean crypto exchanges were penalized, influencing once more the price of Bitcoin. \nRather than befriend Bitcoin, big governments in Asia and the US claim their actions are meant to protect the people from market manipulation. However, they\u2019re actually attempting to kill a currency that poses a threat to government monopolies on seigniorage income and printing money. Somewhere somehow, innovators who understand the crypto world were joined by enthusiasts and early adopters that see the potential of an \u201cexotic\u201d currency \u2013 a better, more transparent hedge that\u2019s better than gold, can be used for cross-border payments, and has a limited supply of 21 million. \nThings could take a turn to the better in Europe, where a member of Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, Joachim Wuermeling, highlighted that an attempt to regulate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would demand international cooperation, as \u201cthe regulatory power of nation states is obviously limited.\u201d\nOn December 22, Belarus legalized cryptocurrency transactions, marking the beginning of a journey to attract foreign investment and foster growth in the private investing sector by freeing the people from Soviet-style stigma. In Russia, The Ministry of Finance recently presented a Digital Assets Regulation Bill meant to legalize and regulate cryptocurrency trading, mining, and ICOs. Given that the Central Bank of Russia is a centralized entity, the officials disagree on several grounds, emphasizing the cryptocurrency trading rule should apply to tokens with real potential to attract viable financial investments.\nThe creators of the bill argue that legalizing cryptocurrency would reduce financial fraud and provide better fiscal transparency. But approving the bill doesn\u2019t mean cryptocurrency will become a legal payment instrument in Russia, as trading would only be allowed through compliant exchanges. \nThey Can Crush It, but They Can\u2019t Kill It\nEven after China\u2019s ban on ICOs in Oct. 2017, Bitcoin didn\u2019t give up. It came up stronger than ever increasing in value from $4,000+ in October to nearly $20,000 in Dec. 2017. Because centralized governments will always hold monopoly on the value of money, Bitcoin enthusiasts will never get to see cryptocurrency replace national currencies. Regardless, just because South Korea, China, the US and other countries can crush Bitcoin by issuing new regulations and influencing cryptocurrency prices, it doesn\u2019t mean they can kill it. \nOn the bright side, blockchain technology is way too powerful to be put down by big governments, and Bitcoin will always remain a collectible digital currency for savvy enthusiasts that understand how technology works, and the potential it has. This 2018, we\u2019re looking at more and more companies eager to accept cryptocurrency as an official payment mode, including Microsoft, PwC, and online retailer Overstock. \nLate last year, CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) and CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) launched Bitcoin futures, proving market confidence in Bitcoin, and strengthening the fact that cryptocurrency is here to stay. Cantor Fitzgerald and NASDAQ are also making plans to develop their Bitcoin derivatives contracts. Furthermore, Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE) recently looked into the possibility of creating a data center in partnership with Blockstream Inc. The goal is to provide hedge fund investors with a crypto-based price data feed that will provide real-time information from 15+ exchanges. \nLast but not least, Goldman Sachs has plans to designate a Bitcoin trading desk, highlighting that more and more institutions are open to accepting and adapting in an already decentralized financial ecosystem.

The first of which is for law enforcement to track bitcoin transactions related to criminal activity. Bitcoin is commonly used in Ransomware attacks, which encrypt a user\u2019s data and force the user to pay a certain amount of money to decrypt it. One such attack, the infamous WannaCry, made nearly $25 million in bitcoin over a period of two years.\nThe Crystal tool in action on the WannaCry ransomware attack\nThe creators of WannaCry, despite its vastness (about $4 billion in damages), mistakes (like the infamous killswitch, meant for testing whether or not the ransomware was sandboxed), and the sheer amount of money lost; no arrests have been made. The Crystal team claims that this attack could have been traced in a matter of 3 hours and could have easily allowed authorities to instruct exchanges to halt withdrawals from the suspected wallet addresses in real time.\nThe second use case for the tool is a compliance measure and risk management tool for financial institutions. As a case study, Crystal uses Bitcoin based venture capital firm aimed at the healthcare sector. The tools aim, in this case, is proving compliance with rules against violating national sanctions, funding terrorism, and money laundering. By producing transparent reports on the sources of funds and where they are going institutions can prove compliance with national laws. This prevents legal action against the venture capital fund and it\u2019s principals. Crystal has also advertised its ability to audit mining operations in order to ensure they aren\u2019t Ponzi schemes and counteract corruption of elected officials (when bribed through Bitcoin, of course).\nNot a New Development\nThe Crystal tool is part of ongoing efforts by the BitFury Group to de-anonymize the blockchain. Earlier this year, the group announced that it had been making progress on a new method for \u201cclustering\u201d related wallets. They published a detailed white-paper\u00a0on the subject explaining their findings and revealing a probabilistic model for determining the relatedness of transactions and then testing it with off-chain data to identify addresses associated with gambling, mining pools, and drug transactions. This first paper,\u00a0 nearly a month old, was successful in de-anonymizing about 15% of the blockchain.\nA table explaining clustering methods in the whitepaper \u201cAutomatic Bitcoin Address Clustering\u201d.\nThe new tool\u2019s marketing materials show that Crystal has been in real-world use for some time and likely has already had an impact on several high profile investigations. The most significant development seems to be Crystal\u2019s risk scoring which are intended to be used in an automated fashion and could conceivably be implemented by major exchanges in the near future.\nToward Anonymity?\nBitfury\u2019s developments toward de-anonymizing the Bitcoin blockchain have the potential to increase the appeal of security-focused cryptocurrencies. We\u2019ve already seen that malware developers convert their currencies from Bitcoin to a less traceable form of currency upon moving the funds to an exchange (Perpetrators of Wannacry, for example, moved it\u2019s funds over to Monero).\nIn order to prevent the real-time exchange level locking, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll start to see more ransomware developers request payment in other forms of cryptocurrency and potentially even return to the dollar.", "category": "Bitcoin Security"}

The largest digital currency, representing almost 35 percent of the total value of the cryptocurrency market, had fallen to as low as $8,369 only yesterday, a 17 percent drop in only a day. Having approached all-time highs of almost $20,000 in December last year, Bitcoin\u2019s dramatic slide saw it consecutively breach critical supports levels of $15,000, $12,000, and ultimately slipping under $10,000. Today\u2019s market movements provide some relief for the besieged currency. \u00a0\n\nEthereum is up almost 10 percent to just under $1,000. Ethereum saw its all-time highs on January 10th, at times a rare green spot in a sea of red for the wider market in January. As the blood continued to spill, however, it proved not to be immune to the severe corrections in the crypto market, dipping below $800 on two occasions.\n\n\u00a0\nHaving nearly halved from its all-time high market cap of $653 billion in mid-December during the current slump, crypto investors are finally enjoying some relief. Though it remains to be seen whether recent gains can be sustained. \nThe market has faced a number of headwinds in recent weeks. Korea finally settled on banning anonymous trading at the end of January, after months of speculation that it was set to ban cryptocurrency trading and perhaps even digital currencies themselves. The Korean decision was a relief to many investors, as it constitutes the third largest market in the world.\nOnly two days ago, Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley outlined the government\u2019s position on cryptocurrencies, refusing to accept them as legitimate means of paying for goods and services or as legal tender:\nThe Government does not consider cryptocurrencies as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these cryptoassets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system.\nOn January 26th it was reported that the Tokyo-based exchange Coincheck had been hacked, with $530 million worth of NEM stolen. To the dismay of many, Coincheck admitted it failed to lock away most of its deposits in cold wallets, citing difficulties in doing so. It also failed to implement NEM\u2019s multi signature smart contract system, an additional layer of security. The hack was the largest in cryptocurrency history.\nOn January 18th, CBOE\u2019s first Bitcoin futures contracts settled at $10,900, with bears winning handsomely. The price of Bitcoin tumbled with the news. With futures contracts becoming the first opportunity to short cryptocurrencies, many worried the new financial instruments and Wall Street would have a negative impact on the market, with retail investors whiplashed around by market forces they barely understood, let alone being equipped to compete with them.\nOn Monday January 29th it was reported that Bitfinex and its auditor Friedman LLP had severed ties. The much-anticipated audit was of interest to the crypto community, as controversy mounted around the issue of whether Tether, the USD-backed token that had reached a market cap of $2.3 billion, was actually backed by fiat cash assets.\nAs Bitfinex announced there would be no audit released, at least in the short-term, it was reported that Bitfinex and Tether, the company behind the namesake digital token, had been subpoenaed by the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on December 6th.\nJanuary has been a bearish month for cryptocurrencies every year since 2015. Many attribute that pattern to Asian market sell-offs with investors cashing out for Lunar New Year.\n\n\n\n\nThis year, however, it seems the market had a lot more issues to contend with. Let\u2019s hope the current reprieve gathers momentum and restores some confidence among crypto enthusiasts. ", "category": "Bitcoin Price News"}

Of that total revenue, the company\u2019s Computing and Graphics division contributed $958 million, up 60 percent from the same quarter in 2016.\nDemand for GPU processing power has surged due to a spike in interest from the blockchain and cryptocurrency community. In an investor call, AMD CEO and president Dr Lisa Su told investors that the cryptocurrency mining market was \u201ca good part of our business.\u201d\nGraphics card shortages have become an increasing dilemma facing both AMD and its main rival Nvidia. Over the past year, prices of Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards have surged, with GeForce GTX 1050 Ti cards increasing by 27 percent, GeForce GTX 1060 3GB cards by 86 percent, GeForce GTX 1060 6GB cards by 89 percent, and GeForce GTX 1080 Ti cards by 59 percent.\nAccording to a TechRadar review, Nvidia\u2019s GeForce GTX 1070 was the best-suited graphics card for cryptocurrency mining. It boasts a high hashing rate and low power consumption, the perfect combination of features for cryptocurrency miners looking to mine Bitcoin, Ethereum and other coins.\nBitcoin mining, in particular, is becoming increasingly difficult by design as its circulation climbs and approaches its supply limit. Of the total 21 million Bitcoins that will ever be mined, there are currently almost 17 million in circulation, according to Blockchain.info. \nAs mining complexity increases, processing power needs will rise accordingly. In 2017, Bitcoin miners used as much as 36 terawatt hours of energy, according to ccn.com. Recent analysis suggests that the\u00a0Bitcoin network consumes more electricity than 159 individual countries. It sits just behind Singapore in terms of electricity consumption.\nGPU supply woes have hit gamers hard. AMD\u2019s XFX Radeon RX Vega 56 graphics card, released in August last year, sold out within 5 minutes. Only months before, AMD\u2019s Radeon RX 580 and RX 570 models were listed as sold out at most major retailers including Amazon, Newegg and Best Buy.\nAs AMD and Nvidia continue to see GPUs run out of stock and customers often buying them in bulk, both companies are working hard to ensure their loyal gaming fans are not priced out of the market. Nvidia has even resorted to asking retailers to limit single purchases to two cards.\nSupply shortages have spiked in the past. In 2013, Bitcoin and Litecoin GPU-based mining drove demand for the cards. Last year, it was Ethereum and Bitcoin mining that attracted the attention of miners. With China\u2019s recent decision to force cryptocurrency mining out of the country, the shortage of mining power is only going to become more acute.\nAMD\u2019s recent announcement that it plans to ramp up production will come as some relief to both the gaming and mining communities. While the supply of silicon is not causing production constraints, the company faces shortages of both GDDR5 and HBM2 memory.", "category": "Mining"}

On Jan. 31, though, DGD began to hasten its climb, and on Feb. 2 it briefly spiked to an all-time high of $491 before sinking back down to a present value of $361. Despite this moderate pullback, the DigixDAO price is still up 42 percent for the day, which is all the more remarkable considering that every other top 100-cryptocurrency is in decline. DGD now has a $723 million market cap.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nThe vast majority of DGD volume is centralized on Binance, where the token\u2019s BTC and ETH pairs account for approximately 88 percent of its global trading volume.

Behind the scenes, though, Bitcoin development continues to plug along without regard for market movements, and one much-anticipated technology \u2014 the Lightning Network (LN) \u2014 has quietly passed a major milestone.\nLightning Network Reaches 1,000 Mainnet Payment Channels\nEarlier this week, the number of open LN payment channels reached 1,000 for the first time. This marked yet another historic checkpoint for the development and adoption of this nascent technology, which many developers could be one of several long-term solutions to Bitcoin\u2019s network congestion, which has reduced the most prominent cryptocurrency\u2019s utility for small-value transactions and led many companies \u2014 including payment processor Stripe \u2014 to abandon support for Bitcoin payments.\nThe Lightning Network promises to ease network congestion by moving transactions off the main blockchain and onto the second-layer LN protocol. Using payment channels, LN users will be able to make near-instant transactions at virtually no cost, which proponents argue will make Bitcoin an attractive medium of exchange for transactions of all sizes.\nLN Node Map | Source: https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/\nAlthough Lightning Network software is still firmly in the alpha testing phase, enthusiastic users have nevertheless begun setting up LN nodes on the Bitcoin mainnet and opening payment channels with one another. As of the time of writing, there were already 419 nodes running LN software on the mainnet, up from fewer than 30 on Jan. 17.\nFor reference, Bitcoin Cash \u2014 the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap \u2014 has 1,171 active nodes (excluding duplicate and non-listening clients), less than three times more that of the alpha-stage LN.\nOther Notable Lightning Milestones\nLightning adoption has passed several other notable milestones in recent weeks, as brave users have risked mainnet BTC to help speed the development of this promising technology.\nIn January, TorGuard began accepting mainnet LN payments for its VPN service, and the company later marked the Lightning Network\u2019s \u201cpizza transaction\u201d when it allowed a brave user to pay for a physical item using an LN payment.\nEarlier this week, meanwhile, Austria-based startup Coinfinity completed what is believed to be the first LN transaction on a Bitcoin ATM.", "category": "Bitcoin Progress"}

Bitcoin has declined by more than 14 percent in the past 24 hours, while Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and other major cryptocurrencies fell by more than 20 percent.\nThroughout the past 12 months, the cryptocurrency market has experienced several 30 to 40 percent corrections. But, the latest correction is one of the worst corrections the cryptocurrency market has endured in the past year because it has lasted for awhile. For a few weeks, the cryptocurrency market has struggled to demonstrate any signs of short-term recovery and as a consequence, the valuation of the market has continued to fall by large margins.\nStill, the cryptocurrency market is not at its 3-month low. In November, the valuation of the cryptocurrency market was less than $200 million, less than bitcoin\u2019s market cap in January. Hence, even if most major cryptocurrencies fall by more than 30 percent from current levels, it will set back the market by only three months.\n\nSeveral analysts including BKCM\u2019s Brian Kelly and renowned trader Peter Brandt stated that the price of bitcoin could dip again before the market shows signs of short-term recovery. Kelly said that the price of bitcoin could decline by 15 percent and the cryptocurrency would still be overvalued. Brandt explained that based on the current trend, the price of bitcoin could drop to $7,700 before rebounding. Kelly noted:\n\u201cThe intrinsic value, the way I measure it is transactions. And I do kind of a simple regression with number of transactions and velocity. And you get an intrinsic value somewhere in the $8,000s.\nThis is such a young technology. To short it, makes absolutely no sense in terms of the risk/reward because this thing can move 20 or 30 percent in a day. So the most I\u2019m going to make is 100 percent of my downside [over time]. And the worst is I\u2019m going to lose 30 percent in a day. And then compound that.\u201d\nKelly emphasized that he would not bet against bitcoin even after the recent correction, as it still remains the most dominant cryptocurrency in the market.\nBrandt, who continuously called out bitcoin\u2019s $7,700 dip since January 22, stated that based on classical charting, bitcoin would likely experience another dip before a recovery.\n\u201cThe crypto-snobs have been quick and dependable to blast classical charting.

After ripping past $2,000 in May, the bitcoin price continued to surpass even the most bullish predictions, and it ultimately ended the year close to $14,000.\nNow, the Saxo analyst is upping the ante.

Consequently, major exchanges left to Hong Kong and have been operating cryptocurrency-to-fiat OTC trading platforms ever since.\nThe Chinese government cannot prevent Huobi Pro, BTCC, and OKEx, three of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the Chinese market that migrated to Hong Kong, from operating because they have based their companies outside the jurisdiction of the Chinese government.\nBut, PBoC governor Pan Gongsheng has suggested the Chinese government to shutdown OTC platforms and exchanges within mainland China to ensure that cryptocurrency trading ban is strictly enforced.\nToday, on January 16, CCN reported that the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) Vice Governor Pan Gongsheng told the government:\n\u201cPseudo-financial innovations that have no relationship with the real economy should not be supported.\u201d\nMany reports have claimed that the statement of PBoC governor Gongsheng triggered the recent drop in the market valuation of cryptocurrencies.

In fact, no single cryptocurrency could give the US dollar a run for its money, so to speak.\u00a0Instead, they are more likely to tussle with one another as they jockey for position among the top 10 digital coins.\nAltcoins, or those cryptocurrencies that are not bitcoin, may not catch bitcoin\u2019s size anytime soon, but nearly 50 of them boast a market cap of USD 1 billion-plus, up from fewer than a dozen only months ago.\nKashkari during a public appearance in his home state is quoted as having said:\n\u201cI don\u2019t see bitcoin as a credible competitor to the dollar in the United States of America, and the reason is the barrier of entry to you creating your own coin and me creating my own virtual currency \u2026 is zero.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the first time Minneapolis Fed\u2019s Kashkari has weighed in on cryptocurrencies, with the official in recent days pointing to blockchain technology as possessing a\u00a0higher potential for use in society over any digital currencies, similarly taking issue with the number of new coins that are being released.\nMeanwhile, bitcoin has been more relatable in design to precious metals, particularly gold, than fiat currency. Similar to gold, bitcoin is said to be a store of value, and that is the very speculation that is said to be driving the price higher. Investors hoarding gold have similarly been drawn to the decentralized nature of bitcoin. Meanwhile, bitcoin\u2019s rise may be at the expense of the gold price, which suffered some hiccups in 2017.\nTo be fair, the value of the world\u2019s mined gold dwarfs bitcoin at approximately USD 7.5 trillion, but gold and bitcoin may be more acceptable opponents than bitcoin and the dollar. Gold might not produce the roller coaster experience that bitcoin investors were on in 2017, but it\u2019s not an emerging asset like cryptocurrencies.\nWhile use cases for bitcoin are on the rise, the cryptocurrency is frequently held, not spent. This feature resembles gold more than it does the dollar.

In the past few hours, the cryptocurrency market demonstrated some signs of recovery, as the market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined increased from $450 billion to $530 billion.\n\u201cBitcoin Decreased Little Bit, Altcoins Plunged a Lot\u201d\nThe claims that bitcoin slumped by a small margin while smaller cryptocurrencies plunged in value are evidently false, given that major cryptocurrencies recorded larger losses in value than small cryptocurrencies in the market.\nBitcoin did decline by a small margin in comparison to Ethereum, Ripple, and Bitcoin Cash, but it also decreased by more than 15 percent. Since December, bitcoin has dropped from $19,000 to $11,000.\nIt is also incorrect to justify the recent decline in the market valuation of cryptocurrencies to the trading ban fiasco in China and South Korea. The Chinese government banned cryptocurrency trading in September 2017. Today, the Chinese market has barely any volume to impact the global cryptocurrency market in any way.\n\u00a0\nMany investors are currently concerned about the state of the market because of the abrupt fall in the value of cryptocurrencies. But, the cryptocurrency market regularly experiences 20 to 30 percent corrections. For instance, when the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) and the Chinese authorities banned initial coin offering (ICO) along with cryptocurrency trading in September, the price of Ethereum declined by more than 30 percent.\nTwo months before that, Ethereum suffered over a 50 percent decline, from $360 to $134. Given the massive corrections Ethereum, bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash have experienced over the past few months, the recent correction is not the biggest correction the market has suffered in the past year.\nWas a Correction Long Overdue\nWhen the market valuation of cryptocurrencies in the market surpassed $500 billion in mid-December, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin stated that he is personally concerned with the valuation of most projects within the market.\nHe questioned whether the market and projects within it have done enough to justify the $500 billion market cap of the cryptocurrencies. While Buterin emphasized that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum have definitely provided enough services to the general public and consumers, they have not done enough to justify their market caps.\n\u201cSo total cryptocoin market cap just hit $0.5T today. But have we earned it? The answer to all of these questions is definitely not zero, and in some cases it\u2019s quite significant. But not enough to say it\u2019s $0.5T levels of significant. Not enough,\u201d said Buterin, sharing a similar sentiment as other Ethereum co-founders including IOHK\u2019s Charles Hoskinson.\nA major correction is healthy for the market which has been overflowing with projects with no substance as of late.

Both China and South Korea have indicated a harsher stance toward domestic cryptocurrency trading, with China planning to block residents from accessing foreign exchanges and South Korea curbing the ability of retail investors to moonlight as day traders.\nThis week, South Korea\u2019s military reportedly blocked soldiers from accessing cryptocurrency exchanges while stationed on military bases. The Justice Ministry, meanwhile, sought to ban cryptocurrency exchanges outright, although the government later cooled those fears.\nHowever, it seems doubtful that these developments alone would cause such widespread turmoil within the global markets.

Corporate America has been looking to the blockchain and cryptocurrencies as a way to resonate with investors, a strategy that while profitable during the best of blockchain times\u00a0has proven to backfire when cryptocurrency prices suffer declines.\nMeanwhile, the bitcoin price suffered declines as steep as 20%, with\u00a0the price\u00a0recovering\u00a0slightly\u00a0to a 16% drop most recently. Ripple, meanwhile, lost\u00a0as much as one-third of its market cap. The\u00a0declines appear to be tied to chatter of tighter cryptocurrency controls in China that would place a wider ban on the trading of bitcoin and altcoins. US equities that investors previously celebrated for their blockchain presence are now being punished, as a more highly regulated cryptocurrency market threatens to take shape.\nNot surprisingly, the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which is a vehicle that institutional investors have used to gain exposure to bitcoin, filling a void left by a lack of an ETF, suffered a 10% drop at last check. The investment has shaved 20% from its\u00a0value in 2018, from a high of 2,261 to today\u2019s levels of under 1,780.\n\nKeep in mind that GBTC similarly fell in sympathy with bitcoin in December when the bitcoin price slid for multiple consecutive days.

Both stocks are higher today, reflecting the ability of these companies to trade on their fundamentals.\nBitcoin Perspective\nMeanwhile, while bitcoin, Ripple and pretty much all of the top 100 cryptocurrencies trading in the red today, it\u2019s important to remember the 30% decline in the bitcoin price over a three-day period in December and similar declines in November that didn\u2019t persist.", "category": "Bitcoin & Blockchain Investments"}

However, no one expected a multiple-day outage, as Kraken experienced plenty of hiccups during their upgrade process which lasted over 48 hours.\nOne of the largest issues with the situation was the lack of communication from Kraken. Kraken remained incredibly quiet on their official twitter account throughout the ordeal, as it didn\u2019t tweet a single time during the extended outage. However, Kraken\u2019s\u00a0status page remained fully updated, and consistently informed users of the upgrade progress \u2013 including details as granular as how developers were \u201cmainlining coffee.\u201d\nThat,\u00a0of course, didn\u2019t stop the media-wave from expressing doubts about the situation, causing widespread panic as many began to believe it was possibly a hacking situation. The cryptocurrency space is no stranger to exchange hacks, considering that millions have been lost in the past between the Mt. Gox incident in 2013, Bit Stamp\u2019s hack in 2015, and even the Bitfinex hack in 2016.\nCall and Response\nAlthough users took to social media to express their outrage, Kraken employee Max Kaplan took the stand to provide a bit of clarity and said \u201cKraken has never been hacked and still remains unhacked.\u201d He also acknowledged that the team \u201cdropped the ball on the upgrade,\u201d but assured customers that their holdings were still safe.\nOne of the status updates on January 12th from Kraken acknowledged these faults \u2013 \u201cYes, this is our new record for downtime since we launched in 2013. No, we\u2019re not proud of it.\u201d\nThankfully, this ordeal has come to an end with a recent update released just a few hours ago from the Kraken team.\nMuch to the relief of customers, Kraken re-opened their doors today and announced free trading until the end of the month. According to the update, Kraken\u2019s downtime was due to a replacement of their legacy trading engine, and issues that came along with the migration. Also announced was a blog post coming in the next few days that will provide more details on the service outage, along with plans to improve client-experience on the platform.\nAlthough Kraken\u2019s situation turned out to be a false alarm, this might keep newer cryptocurrency traders a bit cautious when dealing with centralized exchanges considering general track records.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

Merely hours later, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, which initially found out about the claims of Minister Park through media reports, firmly emphasized that it does not support or agree with the personal statement of Minister Park.\nOn January 12, the Blue House, the executive office of President Moon Jae-in, issued a public statement and an apology to South Korean citizens regarding the recent cryptocurrency trading ban controversy, and noted that a ban will not be imposed in the short-term.\nA spokesperson of the Bareun Party, one of the main opposition parties of the South Korean government, heavily criticized the Moon administration, stating that the premature statement of Minister Park led the entire global cryptocurrency market to plummet in value and led to billions of dollars in losses.\n\u201cIt was an unacceptable behavior which did not take the South Korean citizens into consideration. The trading ban claim of Justice Minister park was a mockery against the South Korean people,\u201d said Yoo eu-dong, the Bareun Party spokesperson.\nA spokesperson of the Kookmin Party, another opposition party of the South Korean government, also noted that the South Korean government remained silent about cryptocurrency regulations and overnight, damaged the cryptocurrency market with a false ban announcement. \nAnother spokesperson of Jayoo Party stated that the South Korean government forced the public to view cryptocurrency investors as uninformed gamblers through the statement of Minister Park, and criticized the government for the recent incident. \nImmense Economic Impact\nMost of the criticisms by opposition parties were targeted at Justice Minister Park, who failed to consider the immense economic impact his words could have had on the global cryptocurrency market. The scale of losses throughout the week was in the billions, and more than 150,000 citizens have signed a petition to reject the trading ban bill and remove Minsiter Park from office.\nThe South Korean finance market is relatively small in comparison to other major regions such as Japan and the US. Given that the cryptocurrency exchange market processes more trades on a daily basis than KOSDAQ, South Korea\u2019s main stock market, the closure of the cryptocurrency market could damage the economy of South Korea at the same scale as closing down the stock market.\nWith the recent cryptocurrency trading ban controversy, the South Korean government has discovered the economic impact of strict regulations on the South Korean finance market and as such, it is unlikely that the government will impose regulations in abrupt manner.", "category": "News"}

That\u2019s because the cryptocurrency exchange \u2014 which is now the 376th-most popular website in the world \u2014 would not launch for another six months.\nBinance Goes from ICO to World\u2019s Largest Cryptocurrency Exchange in Six Months\nBinance was bootstrapped through a July 2017 ICO that raised approximately $15 million, and its early user base was characterized by a heavy geographic concentration in China.\nConsequently, the exchange was disproportionately affected by China\u2019s September cryptocurrency exchange ban, which ordered the closure of domestic bitcoin exchanges and forced Binance to immediately bar a significant number of its users from trading on the platform.\nDespite this setback \u2014 and stiff competition from other exchanges that have been operating for far longer \u2014 Binance has managed to become the world\u2019s highest-volume cryptocurrency exchange that does not support fiat trading pairs, and it often outpaces exchanges that do offer fiat pairs.\nIn the past day, Binance has processed $4.3 billion in trading volume, and CEO Zhao Changpeng told Bloomberg that the exchange has been registering \u201ca couple of million\u201d new users every week, forcing the company to limit the number of new users while it scrambles to keep up with demand.\nOn Jan. 10, Binance opened up registrations for new users for one hour, and more than 240,000 users signed up for the platform during that brief period.\n\u201cWe have a guy whose full-time job is just requesting servers,\u201d Zhao said. \u201cEvery day they say, \u2018OK, here are 200 more,\u2019 but we just ask for more.\u201d\n\u201cWe did not expect this kind of growth, to be honest,\u201d Zhao continued, adding that while the exchange\u2019s average customer is a 25-30 year-old male with deep pockets, it has seen increasing interest from institutional investors.\nReferrals, Lambos, and Bitcoin Forks Drive Demand\nSeveral factors appear to have contributed to Binance\u2019s remarkable ascent.\nThe company has an aggressive referral program that pays out a 20 percent commission, and one user has netted more than 76 bitcoins through this program.\nThe exchange has also used its ICO funds to launch several high-profile promotions, including one recently-concluded giveaway that earned one lucky user a 2018 Lamborghini Huracan RWD Coupe.\nHowever, perhaps the strongest driver of demand is its comprehensive support for altcoins created through forks of the main bitcoin blockchain. While most exchanges have restricted their support to bitcoin cash \u2014 far and away the largest of these forks \u2014 Binance also supports the lesser-known bitcoin gold and bitcoin diamond forks.\nDespite the exchange\u2019s phenomenal growth, Zhao said that the company does not intend to rest on its laurels.

For a very good reason (I\u2019ll get to it in a second). I\u2019m sure Christmas was a great time to explain what bitcoin is, how it works and the many great advantages of distributed ledgers and forms of organizing for many people around the world. Because spreading knowledge is like a virus, what happened? A huge growth of folks entering the crypto markets, not only pouring money into bitcoin and ethereum, but also into other altcoins. Prices spiked, market value went to the moon and we saw, yet again, records being broken (although at the moment of writing the market is quite bearish). All this commotion got me thinking:\nHow far have cryptocurrencies come to be used as means of payment?\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/\nLet\u2019s look at bitcoin. On January 1st 2017 the price of 1 bitcoin was around USD 947.00 and it increased 1367% closing on the 31st of December 2017 at around USD 12,952.00. In some exchanges, it peaked near USD 20,000.00 in mid-December.\nHow is the price of bitcoin related to cryptocurrencies\u2019 usage in payments?\nAlthough the number of investors in bitcoin is increasing exponentially, the diversification of uses cases and mainly adoption hasn\u2019t happened yet. \u00a0Some are able to properly use bitcoin, at a smaller scale of course, but the main problem remains: it\u2019s quite difficult to purchase goods with. Well, in most developed countries that is.\nThe funny thing is this problem seems to disappear when people just use bitcoin on their daily lives. In Venezuela most chose to use bitcoin despite the current high fees, rather than depending on a hyper-inflated currency, controlled by a corrupt government, incapable of keeping the bolivar stable. This is how the true revolution is happening: while many people use bitcoin as a way to store value, others start to use it as means of payments.\nWhy is the price a bottleneck?\nMost people who start looking at bitcoin do it because of the price. And so they think: \u201cI wish I heard about this bitcoin sooner. \u00a0I can\u2019t invest now, it\u2019s too expensive\u201d. Not to mention the ultimate bitcoin dilemma: if I spend bitcoin today won\u2019t I be spoiling future earnings?\nLet\u2019s properly discuss the obvious elephant in the room.\nYes, the price. We get back to where we started. Bitcoin\u2019s price is what makes people desire to participate and what keeps them away at the same time. It\u2019s a double-edged sword. The price is definitely the very first bottleneck.\nThe higher it goes, the more people profit, keeping the blockchain alive. But on the other hand, the more scared people are of joining. The reason is incredible: people cannot afford to buy bitcoin. How can they? Bitcoin\u2019s price is insanely high.\nThe human collective mind is a beautiful thing. It fails to see the most obvious feature of bitcoin (and most cryptocurrencies): it\u2019s dividable, like any other currency. You can buy less than 1 bitcoin. But the number of people who still haven\u2019t truly realized is huge. It\u2019s not their fault entirely; it\u2019s just not that simple to understand when you first hear about bitcoin.\nThe higher the price the more difficult it gets to make a simple decision: whether or not to enter the market at any given point in time. That is everyone\u2019s true fear. The roller-coaster goes something like:\nhttps://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/trading/\nWill bitcoin\u2019s price suffer the same fate?\nWell, as long as people continue to use bitcoin, I don\u2019t think it will. If money is simply a language, there might come a time where we won\u2019t need to \u201cspeak\u201d fiat anymore (on a daily basis). At least among our communities, cities or even countries. If that time comes, the price of bitcoin will simply be bitcoin. It seems we\u2019re still very far, far away, but maybe we\u2019re all just suffering from a new depth perception disease, which prevents us from accurately measuring the impact of bitcoin. It\u2019s not the tulip bubble, nor the internet crash. It\u2019s something completely different.\nPrice is indeed blocking many people from entering the cryptocurrency market. But when people start looking past that, here\u2019s what they will see:\n\nThe ability to store, track and exchange your own money without the need of a central authority;\nThe ability to remain anonymous when using your money;\nThe ability to own your data and be compensated for sharing it;\nThe right to a transparent ledger, no own really owns and belongs to the entire network of users. Just download the blockchain and there you have it.\n\nThe rule of law, monetary policy makers and fiscal policy makers, must adapt to a distributed way of organizing. Because guess what?\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need permission. We forgot to ask for it\u201d.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

In August, Coinbase raised $100m from prominent VCs at $1.6bn, confirming its status as the first \u2018Bitcoin\u2019 unicorn.

But, it is also important to consider the rate of the growth of the market.\nShort-term major corrections prevent bubbles from forming, by shaking off weak hands and solidifying the market. After a 20 percent decline in the valuation of the cryptocurrency market, a large number of weak hands or speculators tend to exist, while strong hands remain in the market.\nGiven sufficient demand for cryptocurrencies from the global market, it is likely that the market will recover in the upcoming days, as it recovers from the South Korea trading ban controversy.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

More pointedly, the authority warned all parties \u2018not to sell, buy or trade\u2019 cryptocurrencies after underlining them as a threat to \u2018the stability of the financial system.\u2019\nA translated excerpt from the public statement reads:\n\u201cOwnership of virtual currency is very risky and full of speculation because there is no authority responsible, there is no official administrator, there is no underlying asset underlying virtual currency price and trading value is very volatile so vulnerable to the risk bubble (bubble) and prone to be used as a means of washing money and financing of terrorism, so that it can affect the stability of the financial system and harm the public.\u00a0Therefore, Bank Indonesia warns all parties not to sell, buy or trade virtual currency.\u201d\nThe central bank\u2019s first public warning on bitcoin came as early as February 2014.

Have You Felt It?\u201d [Part 2]", "url": "https://www.ccn.com/awakening-felt-part-2/", "birthday": "2018-01-15T01:27:30+00:00", "date": "2018-01-15 01:27:30", "year": 2018, "month": 1, "day": 15, "content": "This is the first opinion piece in a four-part series that explores the advent of bitcoin as a store of value and the implications of valuing the cryptocurrency in fiat. Read the first part here.\nExchange: the second bottleneck\nHow do you buy bitcoin?\nGo to an exchange like conify, coinbase or gdax register a profile, pass the KYC (by verifying your identity) and connect your credit card or bank account to it. Because so many people entered the cryptocurrencies market in a short spam, some of these exchanges couldn\u2019t cope with the amount of requests. So what happened?\u00a0 Massive delays in profiles verification, money transfers, bitcoin deposits & withdrawals. In a way, people couldn\u2019t really buy bitcoin, which seems to be a huge problem with cryptocurrency in general: how you exchange fiat-currency for cryptocurrency. And this only gets worse: the exact same thing happened when you exchanged bitcoin for altcoins.\u00a0 As most cryptocurrency exchanges (bittrex, bitfinex or binance for example) aren\u2019t accepting new user profile registrations.\nWhat can we expect in the near future? Will it get easier?\nEventually yes, but don\u2019t think it will be all fun and games. So far we\u2019re still able to buy bitcoin through bank transfers and credit card payments. I\u2019m sure this will eventually become increasingly difficult as new regulation arises (KYC and bitcoin bans were just the beginning).\nhttps://steemit.com/crypto-news/@alao/binance-not-accepting-new-users\nHow?\nAgain, I\u2019m not sure. Many tech developments might eventually facilitate payments and the exchange of fiat-currency for cryptocurrency. Potential solutions are:\n\nDEXs. Instead of relying on single centralized exchanges (yes, all traditional exchanges are centralized), what a decentralized exchange (or DEX) allows, is for people to exchange money instantaneously, peer-to-peer. In terms of security it\u2019s incredibly safer to have information distributed among many peers, rather than \u201csafely\u201d stored in one single place.\n\nAlthough this is quite helpful, how does it fix the second bottleneck: exchanging fiat-currency for bitcoin? Currently no mainstream DEXs has that capability. Any other options?\n\nAtomic swaps. The ability to instantly swap a coin for another without going through an exchange, can be a painless solution for this problem. Atomic swaps include fiat-currency to cryptocurrency. For this technology to work there are certain technical requirements that need to be met. For example cryptocurrencies must share the same hash algorithm, or the ability for users to interact with distributed ledgers via a browser. The only minor problem I see is that atomic swaps need huge market liquidity.\n\nBuying cryptocurrency is still in its early stages. Hordes of people have already entered the market, but not quite enough for a massive change in currency adoption. I will discuss the Lightning Network, SegWit and other features that will enable easier bitcoin payments and incentive usage, during the scalability discussion (a current bitcoin hot-topic).\nStatus quo\nMy macro view regarding future regulation is something like:\n\nIf bitcoin is banned or it gets impossibly hard to get, people who own bitcoin will sell it in those places, as they can hike the price. People will be incentivized to enter the market due to high profits. So that won\u2019t really work. (Yes, even if it\u2019s illegal)\nIf bitcoin is not banned, people will enter the market because of the price and currency properties.\n\nExchanges are currently a bottleneck but not a major one; for most technologies\u00a0there is an initial centralization phase. Accepting the hypothesis that bitcoin will only rise in price, as long as\n\nthe supply remains limited,\nmore people join in,\ncommunity and media hype continues\nand the expected new features get implemented,\n\nI dare to ask the following questions:\n\nWould you prefer the price of your currency to depend on the network of users or on a central government?\nWould you prefer distributed consensus rules to be applied to your currency, that cannot be changed without majority approval (hence the BIP approach), or rules created and managed by a restrict group of people (only sometimes elected by democratic voting)?\nWhat\u2019s best: own a currency accepted anywhere in the world, or a currency that needs to be exchanged to be used outside physical borders?\n", "category": "Bitcoin Economics"}

While China has evolved into a leading domicile for bitcoin mining, the country\u2019s central bankers have been pushing back, triggering a wave of defections among mining operations to head for more cryptocurrency-friendly waters in the Western world, more specifically, Canada. Bitcoin miners are being drawn in from lobbying efforts by energy industry participants looking to proliferate the oil recovery that is unfolding in the region.\nIf it weren\u2019t for bitcoin miners, investors, traders and consumers would have none of the leading digital coin\u00a0with which to transact. And China is responsible for about 75% of that supply. The process places a huge demand on energy consumption, something that both Chinese regions such as\u00a0Xinjiang and Canadian provinces such as Quebec boast plenty of. And with the regulatory hoops that cryptocurrency miners must jump through in China, Canada is looking better each day.\nChina has already been targeting smaller bitcoin mining operations. Now with murmurings of more severe pushback from Chinese regulators on bitcoin mining amid the power drain, including another blanket ban amid \u201cconcerns of excessive electricity consumption and financial risk,\u201d\u00a0Canada has become the next most attractive option amid plentiful and cheap resources and frigid winters as well as a more supportive government on cryptocurrencies. Canada\u2019s extremely cold temperatures aid in the mining process by helping to keep the equipment cool, saving on the electricity bill in the process.\nChina\u2019s leading bitcoin miner Bitmain has been diversifying from its home base and is reportedly considering moving to Canada. Meanwhile, as part of the courting process, Hydro Quebecis reportedly in engaged with dozens of cryptocurrency miners about coming to Canada, including top industry players.\u00a0Meanwhile, cryptocurrency miner BTC.Top is already on its way to the Great White North.\nZQMiner, based in China\u2019s Hubei province, is deeply engaged in the bitcoin mining process, developing and operating bitcoin mining assets across a trio of China\u2019s provinces. The company\u2019s CEO Li Wei told Reuters: \u201cWe, and from what I understand many of our peers, are already making plans to go overseas.\u201d\nWhile the Canadian government may have a friendlier stance on bitcoin mining versus China, the latter of which has banned upcoming ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges altogether, Canada is no slam dunk. Local ICOs such as popular messaging app Kin opted to block Canadian residents from its 2017 token generating event\u00a0amid \u201cweak guidance\u201d from Ontario regulators. Meanwhile, while the power supply is there, the bitcoin-mining infrastructure is not as pervasive, and it could take up to a year\u00a0for mining operations to set up facilities in Canada\u2019s budding crypto-mining industry.", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

While unconfirmed, there are rumors that new rules banning the use of anonymous cryptocurrency trading accounts will kick in on Saturday, January 20th.\u201d\nUnder the revised guidelines, new anonymous virtual accounts will be completely banned. Further, domestic cryptocurrency exchanges will see a mandate to only process deposits and withdrawals to traders with matching account names at their banks and exchanges.\nKorea\u2019s financial watchdog has already been looking into bank accounts related to cryptocurrency exchanges at six of South Korea\u2019s biggest banks. A total of 111 bank accounts related to cryptocurrency exchanges are under the scanner, worth an estimated 2 trillion won ($1.8 billion) in combined deposits.

You face a panel made of renowned central bankers. You slowly raise your hand and ask the million dollar question: \u201cCan anyone tell me what Bitcoin is?\u201d. After a moment of stunned silence, the whole audience roars with laughter. As the laughter subsides, the \u201cmasters of the universe of debt\u201d, will start the usual tirade: it\u00b4s a fraud (J.Dimon), don\u2019t know \u2026but it will end badly (W. Buffett), it\u00b4s only a speculative bubble (R. Dalio), it\u00b4s a Ponzi scheme, it\u00b4s backed up by nothing, it\u00b4s nothing at all\u2026 and so on.\nSo what is Bitcoin?\nThe Position of the Regulators\nOn January 8th, the Bank of Israel was the last Central Bank to issue a press release trying to define what Bitcoin is or \u2013 better \u2013 what it is not.\nHere they go, \u201cBitcoin and similar virtual currencies are not a currency, and are not considered foreign currency and should be viewed as a financial asset\u201d.\nFor the State of New York, Bitcoin is a \u201cdigital unit that is used as a medium of exchange or a form of digitally stored value\u201c.\nFor the German BaFin it is a \u201cunit of account\u201d and therefore a \u201cfinancial instrument\u201d.\nMore comprehensive definitions have been attempted by the EBA in 2014 (European Banking Association) and the Banca d\u00b4Italia, which both define Bitcoin as \u201ca digital representation of value that is neither issued by a central bank or public authority nor necessarily attached to a fiat currency, but is used by natural or legal persons as a means of exchange and can be transferred, stored or traded electronically\u201d.\nQuite to the contrary, the Bank of England and the English FCA have not taken a position yet. \u00a0In fact, the FCA has gone as far as to state that it does not regulate digital currencies and has no intention of doing so.\nMoney and Currency in History\nLet\u2019s see then how monetary history defines both currency and money.\u00a0 Money first.\nIn history, there have been many forms of money, but just looking at modern times, one can identify essentially two forms of money: representative commodity money and fiat money.\u00a0 Throughout history gold and silver, as commodity money, have been the purest form of money. Because they have an intrinsic-use value and they cannot be debased. At the beginning of the 1900s, with the gold standard \u2013 commodity money became \u201crepresentative commodity money\u201d \u2013 which was fiat money backed up and redeemable for gold. Our current system instead is based solely on fiat money (from the Latin, fiat \u2013 let it be) \u2013 which has no intrinsic value and is irredeemable \u2013 and whose value is sanctioned by the government which makes it legal tender within a country. Money must have some essential properties, such as being (i) a medium of exchange, (ii) a unit of account and (iii) a store of value. Money must also be fungible, portable, durable and cognizable.\nWhen a money circulates within an economic system and is accepted as a means of payment \u2013 through banknotes and coins \u2013 then it is also a currency (from Latin currens-entis \u2013 in circulation). Which is essentially \u201ca generally accepted system of money which circulates within an economic system\u201d. Therefore you can have a money which is also a currency and moneys that are not currencies.\u00a0 For example, the moneys par excellence \u2013 gold and silver \u2013 have been also currencies throughout history until Bretton Woods.\u00a0 Today, one can argue that they are not a currency anymore, but still they remain the purest form of money. Although, to be precise, some gold coins are still today legal tender at face value in the US and therefore still a currency. In 1912 J.P.Morgan, when called to testify before the US Congress, said his famous words: \u201cGold is money, everything else is credit\u201d.\nOn the other side, you have all the fiat moneys of the last 4 centuries \u2013 the Dutch gulden, the Spanish real and the British pound \u2013 which were both money as well as reserve currencies at that time and whose value collapsed to zero and do not exist anymore today as forms of money.\nBitcoin\u00b4s Money Features\nSo let\u2019s see how Bitcoin fits in this framework:\n\u2013 as recognized by the EBA, Bitcoin has the features of money, such as being a unit of account and a medium of exchange. The only doubts are for the store of value and the stability features, more difficult to attribute to Bitcoin given its high volatility. However, one can argue that the same feature can be hardly attributed to any of our fiat moneys, considering our central bank policies\u00b4 of debasement and monetary inflation.\u00a0 As evidence suffice to look at a graph of the US dollar vs. gold from 1970 to date, to comprehend that the US dollar is not a store of value (1). Bitcoin\u00b4s volatility is also a function of its lack of liquidity, small market, lack of regulation and young age. \u00a0All those issues will be fixed with time.\n\u2013 Bitcoin is clearly fungible, portable, durable and cognizable, like money should be.\n\u2013 Bitcoin is not however commodity money nor fiat money.\u00a0 But the historical definition of money cannot be kept immutable in the face of technological advancements. Clearly, a digital form of money is nowadays recognized.\u00a0 However, if one can easily accept all forms of digital money which are either derived from fiat or derived from commodities, with regard to Bitcoin one must go a step further. Indeed, before Bitcoin no form of money was built solely upon \u201ctrust\u201d. Yes, because what stands behind Bitcoin is not a government nor a commodity with intrinsic value. Therefore Bitcoin relies solely upon the trust that users, investors, miners and consumers put into it. For that reason, it is very important to analyze what \u201ctrust\u201d means.\nThe Trust in Money\nWe have two forms of trust in money: objective or intrinsic trust and subjective or extrinsic trust.\u00a0 The former is the form of trust that one has in commodity money. One trusts that mother nature has made gold scarce enough and costly to extract as to ensure a limited supply.\u00a0 One trusts its scarcity, objectively.\u00a0 This form of trust is intrinsic in precious metals\u00b4 nature. Then you have the form of trust in fiat moneys, which is subjective, is extrinsic, meaning that you have to trust groups of individuals or societies \u2013 such as governments or authorities such as central bankers \u2013 to act in a way that does not jeopardize the governments\u00b4 finances and its fiat money. The Bank of England for instance, clarifies that the trust in the fiat GBP is instilled by (i) measures to avoid counterfeiting and (ii) low monetary inflation\u2026\u00a0 Simply put, you trust that the government will not abuse the printing presses and \u2013 in short \u2013 will be able to pay its debts and remain solvent. If this type of \u201cgovernment instilled trust\u201d is what solely backs up fiat moneys, do then people have more reasons to trust their governments (i.e. fiat money) or a mathematical algorithm (i.e. Bitcoin)? The question is by no means a small one.\nOne can hardly refute that an objective-intrinsic form of trust is far superior to a subjective-extrinsic trust. The latter can only be rated according to its historical record.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the historical record of fiat moneys is pretty poor. The answer is yet again in Cicero\u2019s magistra vitae. Because history proves ultimately that, when humans have incentives \u2013 such as governments, politicians and the financial elites have in creating new money \u2013 they will always behave accordingly. The result is that no fiat currency in history has ever survived its inevitable\u00a0 debasement. There will always be another Roosevelt, another Nixon, more LTCM\u00b4s, more Lehman, more bailouts, more QE\u2026 Let\u2019s not forget that this form of \u201csubjective\u201d trust can be easily lost and when that has happened in history, the results have been the collapses of past empires \u2013 or in modern times \u2013 the hyperinflations of the Weimar Republic, Argentina, Zimbabwe or Venezuela.\nThat is the fundamental reason why a mathematical algorithm \u2013 which ensures no duplication and double-spending as well as security and transparency in a distributed ledger \u2013 is intrinsically objectively trustworthy, while States and their fiat currencies are not. And that is a huge argument in favour of Bitcoin.\nIf one agrees on this key issue of \u201ctrust\u201d, then a digital money like Bitcoin is not only money but it is superior to any fiat money. More recently also Goldman Sachs has changed its opinion and now agrees that Bitcoin is money.\nNot Yet a Currency\nIf Bitcoin is in no doubt money, can it be also considered a currency? Not yet. But it may well become a currency in the future, depending on how much Bitcoin will evolve into a generally accepted system of money within the global economic system. For instance the Ether (ETH), it is not only money just like Bitcoin is, but it is also for all purposes a currency today. For it is in no doubt a generally accepted system of money payments within the Ethereum community. Therefore, it performs both the functions of a (digital) money and of a (private) currency. Bitcoin however \u2013 unlike the ETH for the Ethereum community \u2013 does not perform a \u201cutility\u201d function within a closed system and for this reason it must be more widely used in the global economy before being considered a (global) currency.\nConclusions\nSo, if defining Bitcoin as money seems after all quite a straightforward exercise, why (almost) no one says that?\u00a0 The likely reasons are both political and economical, with geo-political implications which are closely connected with the \u201ctrust\u201d in fiat money.\u00a0 Indeed, recognizing that Bitcoin is money (superior to fiat) and that it may become an alternative global digital currency in the future, may well pose a threat to the current financial system based on infinite credit creation and money debasement.\u00a0 The one who recognizes that is Christine Lagarde of the IMF, who is said \u201cnot to dismiss lightly crypto currencies like Bitcoin because they could give government-backed cash and monetary policy a \u201crun for their money\u201d in the future\u201d. More recently also Rodgin Cohen, the Senior Chairman of the giant Law Firm Sullivan & Cromwell, said more or less the same on Bloomberg TV, \u201ccrypto currencies may well in the future pose a direct threat to the Fed and other central bank policies\u00b4, as well as to the reserve status of the US dollar globally\u201d.\nOne cannot agree more with that.\n(1) The store of value after 47 years of Monetary (hyper) inflation: how many US$ you would need to buy one ounce of Gold since 1970 (US$36 to $1330).\u00a0 The dramatic loss of purchasing power starts clearly when the US started its massive debasement/credit expansion in the \u00b470s to finance its wars.\n\nAbout the Author\nAndrea Bianconi is an international business Lawyer with over two decades experience, a scholar of Austrian Economics, Monetary History and Geopolitics, a believer in the future of Blockchain based technologies and an active member of Berlin\u2019s Blockchain Hub, a legal consultant to Blockchain businesses, an investor himself and online trader with interest in commodities, precious metals, currencies, Tech stocks and Cryptos.\u00a0 https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-bianconi-blockchain-law/", "category": "Guest Contributor"}

Instead, please check your account balance through the official Stellar Account Viewer, found here,\nIn a statement sent out today by its founder open source online Stellar wallet Black Wallet has claimed to have been hacked. Posting on Reddit, user orbit84 posted that a hacker gained access to his hosting provider account and changed the DNS settings to his own hosted version of BlackWallet. The attackers\u2019 wallet, which the author posted a link to, appears to have amassed around $400,000 USD worth of cryptocurrency Stellar which has seen its market capitalization apply almost 3 fold over the past month.\nMalicious code identified by Kevin Beaumont on BlackWallet.co after the DNS hijacking took place.\nSecurity research Kevin Beaumont was able to identify a piece of code which checked if a user had over 20 lumens and if they did moved them to a hardcoded wallet address. The attack comes after a series of social engineering attacks targeting the ever-growing crypto market.\nExchange EtherDelta suffered a similar attack late last year caused by a DNS Hijacking. That attack was reported to be smaller with the attacker gaining just $250,000 worth of ether.\nMuch like the EtherDelta attack, the attacker appears to have been laundering money to a bittrex address which likely exchanged it for other tokens and further obscured the identity of the attacker.\nHow the Attack Unfolded\nThe attack appears to have been a phishing attack aimed at the blackwallet.co\u2019s hosting provider. Although the poster refused to disclose any more information saying \u201cI cannot disclose more information now to prevent another hack\u201d and promising to post more when he deemed it safe, a DNS lookup appears to have identified the host as 1&1 Hosting. They could not be reached immediately for comment.\nAlthough we are unable to completely verify what happened, Reddit and Twitter users along with the security research community seem to believe they know what happened. They theorize likely happened is someone claiming to be the owner of the website contacted the hosting provider and through social engineering was able to gain access to the account. From there, it was easy to transfer the DNS records over to a website hosted by the attacker.\nWhile it\u2019s clear to members of the community that the host is likely at fault here, the developer of BlackWallet made this attack much easier by open sourcing his creation, which is openly available on Github. Anyone with a slight amount of technical knowledge can clone it and set up an instance for themselves modifying the code as they wish.\nFurther angering users is the use of 1&1 as opposed to a hosting provider with more stringent security measures aimed at enterprise customers such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure. 1&1 has also been a target of angry users who lost money claiming that 1&1 should have done more in the way of social engineering training. The poster has rebuffed these claims asking users to \u201cPlease do not spread rumors about 1&1\u2033.\nFuture Prevention\nFrequent attacks like this have made it abundantly clear to some that WebWallet\u2019s are unsafe, and have led to the emergence of client-side only wallets such as My Ether Wallet.\u00a0These wallets, while still\u00a0vulnerable to a DNS hijacking attack like the one that took place today on Black Wallet go so far as to force users to go through a slideshow detailing the prevention of phishing scams.\nThis type of slideshow would\u2019ve likely prevented some victims of the BlackWallet attack by instructing them to check the SSL certificate which would\u2019ve helped to identify the DNS hijacking attack.\nUnfortunately, as the price of crypto continues to increase, these attacks seem to be becoming more common. Luckily, the introduction of standard enterprise security procedures to exchanges and wallets will mitigate the damage they can do to the community. Coinbase, for instance, has published a case study on their cloud architecture and operational security practices inside of AWS, an industry recognized secure hosting provider.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

While the majority of bitcoin mined in the early days were produced by individual miners, multi-billion dollar firms are starting to enter the global mining sector.\nEvolution: From Individual Miners to Multi-Billion Dollar Facilities\nTraditional assets and currencies are controlled and issued by central entities. Consequently, their supplies can be altered and manipulated by the authorities. The US dollar in particular, the reserve currency of the global economy, has its supply controlled by the Federal Reserve Bank through a method called quantitative easing, a complex term for a simple concept of printing more cash.\nUnlike traditional currencies and assets, the supply of bitcoin is fixed and the rules of the cryptocurrency are determined by its decentralized protocol. Bank of Finland researchers described bitcoin as \u201ca monopoly run by a protocol, not by a managing organization.\u201d\nWhile analysts and critics of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies consistently state that the value of bitcoin is not backed by anything, the value of bitcoin originates from a basic economic concept of supply and demand. In the global market, intrinsic value simply does not exist. Value is always subjective and it solely depends on the supply and demand of the market.\nBitcoin is valuable because of its security, computing power, fixed monetary supply, and rising demand from the global economy. Because only 21 million bitcoins can ever exist, despite the rising demand, more bitcoins cannot be mined or produced once the supply of bitcoin hits 21 million.\n\nIn the early days of bitcoin, individual miners with small-scale mining setups were able to mine many bitcoins with low electricity costs, because at the time, there wasn\u2019t enough computing power contributing to the Bitcoin network and as result, the difficulty level of bitcoin mining was low.\nThe difficulty level in bitcoin mining is automatically calculated based on the amount of computing power contributed to the network. This particular system prevents the absence of large mining facilities from impacting the global Bitcoin network.\nFor instance, hypothetically, if Chinese bitcoin miners and mining pools shut down, it would have minimal impact on the production and mining of bitcoin because then it would be easier for existing miners to mine bitcoin, as the difficulty level decreases.\nEstablished Industry\nBut, the bitcoin mining sector has grown to a major industry and it is highly unlikely that the computing power of bitcoin suddenly decreases overnight by large margins. In the upcoming months, some of the largest technology conglomerates in Japan are expected to enter the bitcoin mining sector, allocating billions of dollars in producing ASIC miners and establishing large-scale mining centers.\nThe entrance of major conglomerates would evenly distribute the power of miners and mining equipment manufacturers within the global bitcoin mining market, which is currently dominated by a few companies including Bitmain.\nHash power or computing power of bitcoin represents the stability of the Bitcoin blockchain network. As the bitcoin network, market, and mining industry mature, bitcoin will evolve into a major currency, store of value, and a medium of exchange.", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

This time, Mnuchin has issued a warning that bitcoin has all the makings of the next \u2018Swiss Bank Account,\u2019 expressing concerns that are twofold \u2014 bitcoin could be treated as an offshore account for money laundering and the rise of the cryptocurrency places consumers in a position to get hurt. This\u00a0according to Mnuchin\u2019s response to a question about bitcoin at the Economic Club of Washington in recent days accessible on Bloomberg.\nIn a question about \u201cwhat the US government should do about\u201d bitcoin, Mnuchin lightened the mood by asking moderator\u00a0David Rubenstein for full disclosure on bitcoin ownership, to which Rubenstein responded that he \u201cdidn\u2019t even know what it is\u201d and that he \u201cmissed the boat,\u201d to a round of laughter.\nMnuchin said the US Treasury is \u201cvery focused\u201d on cryptocurrencies, pledging to work with the Group of 20 nations (G-2o) to stop digital coins such as bitcoin from rising to\u00a0the status of a digital version of a Swiss bank account. For instance,\u00a0Mnuchin pointed to the United States as a model, given the know-your-customer (KYL) protocol for digital-wallet companies that is embedded in US\u00a0law. This gives the US government a way to track the cryptocurrency trail to combat money laundering and other nefarious activities. But the rule is absent from the rest of the world.\n\u201cIf you have a wallet to own bitcoins, that company has the same obligation as a bank to know\u201d you as a customer. We can track those activities. The rest of the world doesn\u2019t have that, so one of the things we will be working very closely with the G-20 is making sure that this doesn\u2019t become the Swiss numbered bank account,\u201d said Mnuchin.\nThe other side of the cryptocurrency coin that Mnuchin worries about is the speculation tied to cryptocurrency trading, which he suggested puts consumers at risk.\nTroubleshooting Bitcoin\nIt\u2019s not just \u201cbad people\u201d that policymakers must contend with. For instance, an underling to Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly pointed to digital currencies as a way to offset strengthening sanctions from the United States given the anonymous nature of some coins, for instance, Monero and Zcash. But a D.C. lawyer cited in Bloomberg rebuffed those claims as \u201csilly,\u201d suggesting that cryptocurrency would merely complicate, not prevent, the spending trail from being traced.\nMeanwhile, don\u2019t expect the Fed to issue a digital dollar to replace physical-world money anytime soon. Policymakers put those rumors to rest, for now, after weighing the plusses and minuses of doing so and determining there was no point.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

Being a native Chinese currency it is also expected to benefit from the size of the Chinese market, the second largest consumer market in the world.\nPossible Factors\nSo what is the explanation for NEO\u2019s resilience in this market-wide correction? Increasingly, ICOs are looking to launch on NEO rather than ETH platforms, as it is faster and transaction fee-free. NEO\u2019s GAS tokens \u2013 in finite supply \u2013 will be used by ICOs to fuel their smart contracts. Holders of NEO earn dividends from the use of GAS.\nFurthermore, developers looking to write smart contracts on Ethereum need to learn that platform\u2019s proprietary programming language Solidity. NEO, on the other hand, is written in C# and Java, making it far more accessible to developers wanting to join the community to support its development. As argued in a reddit thread:\u00a0BTC was crypto 1.0,\u00a0ETH was crypto 2.0, and\u00a0NEO is crypto 3.0.\nLong-term investors in the cryptocurrency community are no strangers to wild market volatility and many consider it part of the growing pains of a new industry. However, this current bearish run sees no sign of abating. Then again, normal market signals that inform most markets tend to have little impact on the cryptocurrency market.\nNEO\u2019s momentum in spite of this bearish run could signify that crypto traders have identified a coin with superior technology and a usability case. It could also be, however, merely an aberration indicative of a new and speculative marketplace. It is not the only currency to have had its moment in the sun. Only time will tell.\nWith its record high price, NEO is now the ninth largest cryptocurrency by market cap and has benefited from the bullish trend in digital currencies over the last few months of 2017. That sentiment has swung for the worst for many currencies, however, in the early days of the new year. \nThe past week has presented a number of challenges to cryptocurrencies. These include fears of a possible ban on cryptocurrency trading in South Korea, the Kraken exchange meltdown, and Warren Buffett\u2019s prediction of cryptocurrencies facing a \u2018bad ending\u2019 and his overall dismissal of the new landscape.\nIn addition, the Chinese government has announced plans to clamp down on coin mining activities under a number of guises, including electricity usage and land tax reforms. China and South Korea have banned ICOs, and Japan is considering following suit. A number of high-profile ICO scams have rattled investor confidence and dented credibility in the market. \nAccording to coinmarketcap, the current correction has wiped over $50 billion dollars from the market since January 13th. \n\nThis correction follows on from a pre-Christmas correction that saw values plummet across the board. Currently, Bitcoin is hovering at around US$14,000, down from it\u2019s December 17th all-time high of just under US$20,000. Ripple XRP, a coin that rose rapidly in December, has had a horrid run since January 8th, falling from a high of US$2.56 to its price at the time of writing of US$1.83, despite a strategic partnership announcement with MoneyGram only days ago. \n\n\u00a0", "category": "Altcoin News"}

Cardano, or ADA, has been receiving more media coverage than major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum.\nIn South Korea and Japan, ADA is being acknowledged as a legitimate competition against Ethereum, given its proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain protocol that supports decentralized applications. \nHowever, apart from several cryptocurrencies, the cryptocurrency market is struggling to fully recover from the correction it experienced on January 15, which was triggered by the uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market in South Korea.\nOnce the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market rebounds from the government\u2019s premature statement on banning cryptocurrency trading, which has since been refuted by the Blue House, the executive office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the cryptocurrency market will likely increase in value at a rapid rate.\nBitcoin Fees\nStill, in most major markets, bitcoin remains problematic for casual users and newcomers due to its high fees. Analysts expect the scalability issue of bitcoin and the congestion of the Bitcoin blockchain network to be resolved to a certain extent with the integration of Segregated Witness (SegWit) and batching transactions by major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Bitfinex. \nPreviously, Ledger, the cryptocurrency hardware wallet manufacturing firm, stated that SegWit can reduce bitcoin transaction fees by up to 40 percent, and through transaction batching, the Bitcoin blockchain network\u2019s congestion could drop drastically.\nInvestors and users are highly anticipating the integration of SegWit and other innovative sealing solutions by the key players within the cryptocurrency market. But, if the transaction fees of bitcoin remain relatively high even after the integration of SegWit and efficient transaction batching systems, the market will react negatively to the progress.\nAs of current, bitcoin is still considered as the reserve currency of the cryptocurrency market, given its low volatility rate in comparison to other cryptocurrencies.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

Batch transactions together every X minutes.\nIt\u2019s not a new revelation that a significant cause of bitcoin network congestion is from popular services such as Blockchain, Coinbase, and Gemini who are using block space inefficiently. If you don\u2019t want to contribute to the problem, don\u2019t use them.\u201d\nLopp added that several major cryptocurrency exchanges are currently using batching IIRC and SegWit to reduce transaction fees and relieve the Bitcoin blockchain network from congestion. \u201cBitstamp, HitBTC, Kraken, LocalBitcoins, and QuadrigaCX all use both SegWit and batching IIRC,\u201d Lopp noted.\nAccording to the bitcoin and market data provided by Blockchain, the second most popular wallet platform in the cryptocurrency market, the size of the bitcoin mempool remains above 121 million bytes, with blocks averaging at 1.05MB. But, the daily transaction volume of bitcoin is actually down from over 450,000 transactions to 225,800 transactions.\n\nThe Bitcoin blockchain network is demonstrating a similar level of congestion as a few weeks ago, when the network processed nearly twice as much as the current daily transaction volume. \nOn the Bitcoin network, the mempool operates as the holding area for unconfirmed transactions. Miners have to pick up transactions from the mempool to verify and confirm payments, and send the transactions to the main Bitcoin blockchain.\nIf the Bitcoin blockchain network\u2019s mempool is congested, it is difficult for the miners to process transactions in a speedy manner, decreasing the usability, efficiency, and accessibility of bitcoin as a digital currency and a medium of exchange.\nLopp and other renowned experts in the cryptocurrency sector have criticized major businesses like Coinbase and Blockchain for not implementing dynamic fee systems, SegWit, and batching to reduce fees for their customers and for the entire Bitcoin network. Large-scale platforms like Coinbase process more transactions than 70 percent of the businesses in the industry combined. As such, the impact Coinbase has on the ecosystem of bitcoin is truly immense.\nCoinbase CEO Responds\nIn response to the criticism, Brian Armstrong, the CEO at Coinbase, announced that the company will add SegWit, batching transactions, and other innovative solutions to improve the backlog of transactions on the Bitcoin network. He stated:\n\u201cCoinbase is working on batching transactions, SegWit, and a number of other strategies to improve transaction backlog. Thanks for bearing with us.\u201d\nWhether the integration of SegWit and batching transactions can drastically improve the scalability of bitcoin and reduce congestion on the Bitcoin network by large margins remain unclear. But, the overall stance of the bitcoin community as of now is to have SegWit and batching completed first, and discuss on-chain scaling and block size increase after, if SegWit and batching are not sufficient.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

The memo from the meeting, held among internet regulators and other legislators last week, also has Pan suggesting local and national authorities target centralized cryptocurrency trading venues and the wider bitcoin services industry. Individuals and institutions who provide settlement and clearing services, guarantees and even centralized online wallet providers are also to see a ban, Pan reportedly added.\nIn details coinciding with Bloomberg\u2019s report, Pan also called on China\u2019s internet regulator to block access, censoring Chinese users from domestic and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges alongside mobile apps enabling centralized trading services.

The price of most cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash declined by around 10 percent, while small cryptocurrencies recorded larger losses.\nWith the exception of NEO and Monero, all of the top 20 cryptocurrencies have fallen in value. Cryptocurrencies that have recorded a decline of over 10 percent include Ripple, Cardano, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, EOS, Dash, Tron, Bitcoin Gold, and Ethereum Classic.\n\nSmall Cryptocurrencies Take a Big Hit\nCryptocurrencies with lower market caps, specifically cryptocurrencies outside of the top 10 global rankings, have recorded larger losses than established digital currencies like bitcoin and Ethereum. Even cryptocurrencies with trading volumes heavily concentrated in South Korea such as Qtum and EOS have declined in value, even though the South Korean cryptocurrency market recovered from the latest trading ban FUD.\nThe recent correction of the cryptocurrency market was not triggered by South Korea or China, as the market have already recovered from the FUD produced by the authorities in both regions. Rather, it is likely that the major correction was caused by the abrupt surge in the market valuation of most cryptocurrencies in the market within a short period of time, with minor corrections.\nWithin the past 30 days, the market valuation of cryptocurrencies increased from $540 billion to $840 billion, with several cryptocurrencies with Tron that do not have enough users, decentralized applications, and user activity to justify their market valuations, surging by billions of dollars.\nThe technology of cryptocurrencies is irrelevant in this argument. The technology of Tron or other cryptocurrencies could be sophisticated and advanced. They likely are. But, not enough users are using these blockchain networks to give them multi-billion dollar valuations. As Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin previously stated:\n\u201cSo total cryptocoin market cap just hit $0.5 trillion today. But have we earned it? How many unbanked people have we banked? How much censorship-resistant commerce for the common people have we enabled? How many decentralized applications have we created that have substantial usage?\nIn the last 3 years, the crypto market cap has increased by 200x, but I definitely don\u2019t feel like crypto\u2019s potential has increased by 200x. In some key sectors (eg. payments) it has even regressed.\nThe answer to all of these questions is definitely not zero, and in some cases it\u2019s quite significant. But not enough to say it\u2019s $0.5T levels of significant. Not enough.\u201d\nConsidering that public blockchains have not been able to demonstrate their potential through the success of decentralized applications, it is normal that the cryptocurrency market has experienced a major correction. It is also healthy that the market experiences corrections on a regular basis, as corrections prevent short-term bubbles from forming.\nShort-Term Trend\nAs the market did many times in the past few years, most cryptocurrencies will likely recover in value in the upcoming days. It is more likely that South Korea and Japan-centered cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Zcash, Dash, and Qtum will recover first.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

Therefore, in order to strike a balance, we must achieve controllable anonymity, disclosing the transaction data only to the third party of the central bank,\u201d he said.\nNotably, the central banker also said that it is unlikely that the CBDC network will support smart contracts because this functionality would alter the nature of the currency, which is meant to be digital cash.\n\u201c[A]dding extra social or administrative functions to the cash actually derails the renminbi,\u201d he concluded, noting that the Chinese yuan can legally only be used for specific functions: pricing, exchanging value, and storing value.", "category": "Banking"}

The team will reportedly be led by Akash Ambani, the eldest son of Mukesh Ambani who is the managing director of Reliance Industries. One of the world\u2019s richest men, Mukesh Ambani is worth an estimated $40.1 billion with a 44.7% stake in the conglomerate.\nThe blockchain development team \u2013 to consist of professionals with an average age of 25 years \u2013 will also work toward developing its own cryptocurrency called Jiocoin.\nSpeaking to the publication, an anonymous insider familiar with the developments outlined potential use cases for the technology, stating:\n\u201cOne (application) is cryptocurrency. We can deploy smart contracts. It can be used in supply chain management logistics. Loyalty points could altogether be based on JioCoin.\u201d\nAlthough details remain scarce, it\u2019s easy to spot reasons for Reliance Jio\u2019s foray into developing its cryptocurrency. The company has a massive network of entertainment offerings including Jio Phones, JioTV, JioNet WiFi, Jio Cinema, Jio Music and notably, Jio Money. With Jio Money, Reliance Jio has developed its own payment gateway and wallet that predictably brings a wide range of discounts on purchases in food, travel, apparels and more. With its own cryptocurrency, Reliance Jio could conceivably issue loyalty points in cryptocurrency that can be used for purchases throughout the Jio ecosystem.\nWhile India\u2019s highly competitive mobile telephony market already sees some of the lowest tariffs in the world, the recently-launched Reliance Jio \u2013 with a 4G network covering the entire country \u2013 has heavily disrupted the sector with significantly discounted data usage rates and freebies to become the country\u2019s fourth-largest telecom operator.

Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Benchmark and Sequoia Capital have each committed $20 million the blockbuster deal, according to the FT citing people close to the token sale. Telegram, a privacy-focused encrypted messaging app, is wildly popular within the cryptocurrency community, and they could just be the blockbuster ICO of 2018, setting the standard and tone for the rest of the year.\nFor context, ICOs, which is the modern way for blockchain startups to raise funding and for some traditional companies to stay relevant, raised approximately $4 billion in all of 2017. The largest of those deals was data-storage startup Filecoin, which raised $257 million. Meanwhile, Canadian messaging app for teens, Kin, raised about $100 million in its ICO, and it excluded local investors from the deal amid unclear regulation.\nTelegram is targeting $600 million in this private fundraising round, in which big investors are getting a discounted price to the crowdsale of the same size that\u2019s planned for March, the FT reports.\nWhile regulators have their eye on token sales, the market is largely unregulated, and there\u2019s more than a hint of skepticism among policymakers and even blockchain pioneers about the potential and/or intentions of many newcomers to deliver on the promises they make.\nDubai-based Telegram, however, has what many other ICOs lack \u2014 170 million users across billions of messages each day. (Telegram founder Pavel Durov reportedly splits his time between London and Dubai these days.) This user traction removes a great deal of the speculation and risk that is tied to many of the unproven business models that similarly seek to launch token sales.\nNot that there isn\u2019t any risk. Telegram plans to develop its own blockchain, dubbed TON, on which a marketplace of sorts where business owners and Telegram\u2019s users will exist, all fueled by the TON token. That platform won\u2019t see the light of day till 2019.\nThe Intersection of VC & ICOs\nThe blending of Silicon Valley\u2019s venture capital with ICOs is a trend that is only becoming more pervasive, as VCs increasingly opt to chase\u00a0blockchain opportunities\u00a0rather than remaining on the sidelines. For instance, Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins \u2014 both reportedly Telegram backers \u2014 are of the dot-com era, when they both famously backed a winner, Google. One of the greatest signals of this shift is Google Ventures backing of cross-border payments startup Ripple.\nIncidentally, US venture capital poured $84 billion into more than 8,000 deals in 2017, revisiting the dot-com levels of the year 2000, as per PitchBook data. 2018 is shaping up to be more of an overlap between traditional VC and ICOs, with venture capitalists such as Raleigh-based early-stage backer Full Tilt Capital targeting $25 million for a cryptocurrency fund.", "category": "FinTech News"}

In terms of new entrants to the market place, Hockey explained that they are experiencing 72 percent on year-over-year growth with those new accounts.\nHelping to fuel this rise of interest in millennial trading is reportedly due to the increasing attention on digital currencies such as bitcoin and the legalisation of\u00a0marijuana in various U.S. states.\nIn Hockey\u2019s opinion in the last full quarter of 2017, digital currencies and\u00a0marijuana made up around seven to eight percent of the 726,000 trades on\u00a0TD Ameritrade. A year previously they only accounted for around two percent.\nWith December came a peak in cryptocurrency prices with bitcoin within touching distance of $20,000 for the first time.\nHockey added:\nWe all saw it, right? We went to holiday parties. Everybody was asking about your opinion around cryptocurrencies, blockchain.\nHowever, since then, values in the market have abated slightly with bitcoin currently trading at $11,143, according to CoinMarketCap. Yet, regardless of this dip in price amid regulatory uncertainty and fears of a bubble, TD Ameritrade is still trading high. According to Hockey, the company is doing around 975,000 trades a day.\nHe said:\nIf you took out all of the blockchain, all of the cryptocurrencies, and all of the cannabis-related stocks that number would still be just shy of 900,000. So there\u2019s great general interest as well.\nTD Ameritrade is extending trading hours on its platform to 24 hours, five days a week for major popular exchange-traded funds. In Hockey\u2019s opinion, this is the right move as market-moving events often take place overnight.\nAccording to\u00a0Brian Kelly, portfolio manager of the\u00a0BKCM Digital Asset Fund, now is the right time to invest in digital currencies. Speaking on CNBC, Kelly explained that during this period of \u2018hands-off\u2019 as uncertainty remains over the market regarding regulation, \u2018now\u2019s the time you start looking at it, on the buy side.\u2019\nWith money still flowing into the cryptocurrency, \u2018this is not the end of bitcoin,\u2019 he explained.

Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck was hacked in what is believed to be the largest exchange theft ever carried out. This story is continually developing, but here\u2019s what we know so far.\nThis Was the Largest Cryptocurrency Exchange Hack in History\nIn a press conference, Coincheck executives confirmed that the hackers absconded with more than 500 million NEM, worth approximately $530 million at the time of the hack, although\u00a0Nikkei Veritas tweeted from the conference that the exact amount of funds stolen will not be known until officials conduct a detailed investigation.\nThe Coincheck hack supplanted Mt. Gox as the biggest cryptocurrency exchange hack in history. The Mt. Gox thief made off with approximately 850,000 bitcoins, worth roughly $450 million at the time.\nGranted, the Mt. Gox hack was larger as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market cap at the time of the theft, but in pure fiscal terms Coincheck now holds the infamous distinction of having been victim to the biggest cryptocurrency exchange hack in history.\nAs of the time of writing, the hacker had moved 300,000 XEM tokens to another address, and both addresses had been flagged with a mosaic warning other exchanges to not accept the funds.\nSource: ournem.com\nThe Coincheck Hacker Only Breached the Exchange\u2019s NEM Wallet\nCoincheck executives said that the hack was isolated to Coincheck\u2019s NEM wallet and that its other funds remain secure.\nThis brought to relief to many traders, as early reports made it appear as though the hacker had infiltrated multiple wallets. A Ripple ledger monitor flagged a $110 million XRP transaction sent from Coincheck to an unknown wallet that currently holds more than $3 billion worth of XRP.\n\n110 mil usd in #Ripple (XRP) were sent from the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck to an unknown address. Hacking suspected. https://t.co/hmGhlSmJEH\n\u2014 Costin Raiu (@craiu) January 26, 2018\n\nHowever, the transaction is now believed to have been a security measure taken by Coincheck following the infiltration of its NEM wallet.\nNEM Foundation executives have stressed that the hack had nothing to do with the security of the XEM cryptocurrency itself and that the blame lies solely with Coincheck.\nCoincheck Kept Way Too Much Money in Its Hot Wallets\nAs CCN reported, Coincheck executives admitted during the press conference that they kept that vast majority of their funds in \u201chot wallets,\u201d which become vulnerable if hackers breach company servers.\nBecause hacks have become so common, reputable cryptocurrency exchanges keep the vast majority of their funds in \u201ccold wallets,\u201d which are stored offline and in secure locations.\nCoincheck, however, said that \u201cIt was hard for us to manage cold wallet,\u201d which is why the hack was so much larger than other recent cryptocurrency exchange thefts.\nTo make matters worse, Coincheck did not implement NEM\u2019s multisignature smart contract system, which would have added an additional layer of security to the wallet.\nNEM Doesn\u2019t Plan to Fork to Recover the Stolen Funds\nBecause the hack comprised such a large percentage of the total number of XEM in circulation, there was immediate speculation that NEM would activate a hard fork to recover the funds from the hacker, as Ethereum did following the DAO theft in 2016.\nHowever, Lon Wong, president of the NEM Foundation has said publicly that he opposes a fork.\nSource: Twitter\nIn a statement, he reiterated that the hack occurred due to Coincheck\u2019s \u201crelaxed\u201d security measures, not an inherent flaw in the NEM source code. Wong also encouraged cryptocurrency exchanges to take advantage of its multi-signature smart contract.\nCoincheck Wants to Continue Operating \u2014 and Compensate its Customers\nFinally, Coincheck executives stated that they intend to continue operating the exchange and will compensate customers for their losses, although they did not go into detail about what form this compensation will take.\nNotably, though, Tokyo-based Bloomberg reporter Yuji Nakamura said that Coincheck had not yet received an exchange license from Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency (FSA). The deadline was October, but the FSA had extended a grace period to the company.\nBoth the scale of the theft and the revelation of Coincheck\u2019s inadequate security practices raises questions about whether the FSA will take action against the exchange \u2014 or perhaps even shutter it altogether.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

Bitcoin is still down nearly 50 percent from its all-time high at $19,000, and other cryptocurrencies like Ripple and Bitcoin Cash are almost down 70 percent from their all-time highs.\nAt one point, Ripple neared $150 billion in market valuation but as of January 27, the market cap of Ripple remains below $50 billion. That is a 3-fold fall within a two-month period.\nEthereum has fallen the least from its all-time high at $1,300, and has been one of the best performing major cryptocurrencies in the market. It has held above the $1,000 mark throughout several major correction and today, the price of Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, increased by 4.6 percent.\n\nLast week, the $9 billion financial service provider Stripe noted that due to the high fees and long confirmation times of the Bitcoin network, it has started to search for alternatives within the global cryptocurrency market to bitcoin. Stripe mentioned Ether and other cryptocurrencies launched on top of the Ethereum protocol such as OmiseGo.\n\u201cFees have risen a great deal. For a regular Bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of U.S. dollars is common, making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires. Because of this, we\u2019ve seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease. And of the businesses that are accepting Bitcoin on Stripe, we\u2019ve seen their revenues from Bitcoin decline substantially,\u201d said the Stripe team.\nCurrently, fees on the Bitcoin network are less than $1, because the daily transaction volume of bitcoin has declined over the past few weeks. When the demand for bitcoin spikes again as its price increases, it is likely that fees will increase as well.\nFinancial service providers like Stripe believe that in the short-term, businesses could move away from bitcoin due to its high fees to other alternatives like Ethereum. The adoption of Ethereum by retailers could be a driving factor for its mid to long-term price growth.\n\u201cWe\u2019re interested in what\u2019s happening with Lightning and other proposals to enable faster payments. OmiseGO is an ambitious and clever proposal; more broadly, Ethereum continues to spawn many high-potential projects,\u201d added Stripe.\nWhile the Ethereum network was not designed specifically to process payments, it has become a widely utilized digital currency. It is processing 7x more transactions than bitcoin, with a daily transaction volume of 1.4 million. The rapid increase in the user base of Ethereum has led its price to increase over the past few weeks.\nRipple\nFor a month, Ripple has struggled to demonstrate any strong signs of recovery despite several high profile partnerships it had secured with companies such as MoneyGram and major South Korean banks. Japanese and South Korean financial institutions are expected to roll out Ripple integration by early February. If the integration turns out to be successful, it will be reflected positively by the price trend of Ripple. If not, the price of Ripple could continue to decline in the short-term.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

Robert Shiller, a Yale economics professor who won the Nobel Prize for an empirical analysis of asset prices,\u00a0at the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland referred to bitcoin as a \u201cclever idea,\u201d one that he seemingly continues to contemplate despite his doubts.\nFor all of bitcoin\u2019s ingenuity, Shiller likened it to the Unidad de Fomento, Chile\u2019s unit of account that he said reflects a similar attempt to \u201cchange\u201d the fiat system. He actually favor\u2019s the Chilean approach for features such as adjusting for inflation and maintaining price stability, the latter of which cryptocurrencies thus far have been unable to prove, to the chagrin of policymakers.\n\u201cI tend to think of bitcoin as an experiment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an interesting experiment, but it\u2019s not a permanent feature of our lives. We are over-emphasizing bitcoin, we should broaden it out to blockchain, which will have other applications,\u201d said Shiller as cited in CNBC.\nWhile Shiller\u2019s curiosity about bitcoin may not be an about-face from recent comments that Shiller made on cryptocurrencies, it reflects a dose of moderation and certainly shows more constraint than some of his Nobel-economist winning peers. In recent days, Shiller, who is behind the famous Shiller Index, said he expected bitcoin would \u201ccollapse\u201d and be forgotten\u201d even if it took a century to do so. In the meantime, he\u2019s sure warming up to the idea.\nBitcoin Price Stability Ahead?\nShiller clearly has given bitcoin some thought, exploring its capacity for hedging/short trades but its inability to streamline these capabilities, sort of like some of the other inefficiencies tied to bitcoin such as lengthy transaction times, for instance. But he said he was \u201cstruck\u201d by this phenomenon, which suggests Shiller, as an economist for asset prices, has contemplated bitcoin\u2019s applications.\n\u201cFinancial theory says that if something is not shortable then it can be taken over by enthusiasts, and the doubters can no longer have an adequate way of vetting against,\u201d said Shiller, pointing to the advent of bitcoin futures contracts at Chicago\u2019s CME and CBOE as a potential harbinger of more price stability.\nOf course, Shiller\u2019s characterization of bitcoin as an \u201cexperiment\u201d is not inaccurate and would likely resonate with even blockchain veterans. Wences Casares, one of the foremost authorities on blockchain and bitcoin, in a recent chat with PayPal\u2019s Schulman referred to bitcoin as an interesting experiment,\u201d one whose odds are more in favor of succeeding than failing. But Casares also said you can\u2019t separate the blockchain from bitcoin, which is a concept that Shiller doesn\u2019t seem to grasp, at least not yet.", "category": "Bitcoin Economics"}

The cause of the hack is currently under investigation, according to a notice on the company\u2019s website. Similar events in other currencies including JPY have not been confirmed.\nOn Jan. 26, Coincheck suspended some of its functions after an event occurred around 02:57 on that date. The company detected an abnormality around 12:07 and issued a notice regarding the temporary suspension of NEM payments. At around 12:38, NEM trading was temporarily suspended. At around 16:33, withdrawals of all handling currency including JPY were suspended, followed by the temporary suspension of trading other than BTC, including credit card, pay day and convenience store activity. Eventually, exchange executives confirmed the theft near the end of the day.\nCoincheck will refund NEM holders in Japanese yen to their CoinCheck wallets.\nCoincheck To Calculate Losses\nCoincheck will calculate the compensation price using the weighted average of the volume, with reference to the Zaif XEM currency exchange operated by Tek Bureau Inc. The calculation period is the time of the sale stop, 12:09 Japan time on Jan. 26, to the release delivery time, 23:00 Japan time on Jan. 27.\nThe compensation amount will be 88.549 yen times the number of units held.\nCoincheck apologized for any inconvenience caused to business partners, customers and related parties.\nThe exchange stated that it is committed to resuming services, to investigate the causes of the illegal remittance and to strength its security system.\nCoincheck also said it will continue its efforts to seek registration of virtual currency exchanges to the Financial Services Agency.\nA Security Failure\nDuring a press conference following the suspension of activity, CoinCheck executives revealed several details about the hack and specifically the infrastructure of the Coincheck cryptocurrency exchange. Yuji Nakamura, a technology reporter based in Japan, reported that the Coincheck trading platform had not implemented multi-signature technology, stored all of the hacked funds in a hot wallet, and that the developers of Coincheck were still not sure how the exchange was hacked.\nMost major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Bitfinex have multi-signature security measures in place, which prevent funds from being processed on public blockchain networks until a third-party security service provider confirms the legitimacy of transactions.\nThe lack of a multi-signature service is a critical security flaw for any cryptocurrency exchange. If multi-signature technology was integrated, the security breach could have been prevented.\nAlso read: Coincheck\u2019s $530 million cryptocurrency hack was inevitable\nFunds Stored In \u2018Hot Wallet\u2019\nIn addition to not having implemented multi-signature security measures, Coincheck kept all of its funds in a hot wallet. In cryptocurrency, a hot wallet is defined as a wallet that is connected to the Internet, while a cold wallet is described as a wallet which is stored offline. For large sums of user funds, cryptocurrency exchanges usually store cryptocurrencies in cold storage, to ensure that even in an event of a hacking attack, hackers cannot access user funds.\nThe malpractice of Coincheck of storing funds in a hot wallet and not implementing a multi-signature system ultimately led to the loss of user funds.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

Lance Gilman said he closed escrow on the deal a week ago, but details surrounding Blockchains, LLC\u2019s development plans are scarce.\n\u201cFrom 15,000 feet (above ground view), I believe they envision a product that will showcase all of the capabilities of the blockchain technology,\u201d Gilman told Nevada Newsmakers.\nBlockchains, LLC describes itself as an advocate for social change, with a focus on providing digital-fueled financial services and software Dapps on the Ethereum blockchain. They\u2019re an incubator of sorts for the development of blockchain-driven ideas and businesses.\nGilman went on to describe a blockchain-based community comprised of thousands of houses and apartments and brick-and-mortar retail shops \u2014 all powered by distributed ledger technology.\u00a0The development would extend to services you would expect to gain access to from a major highway, from hotels to truck stops, to dining establishments.\u00a0 \u201cAnd again, all with the blockchain technology foundation\u201d he added.\nBlockchains, LLC will be sharing the spotlight with Nevada\u2019s \u201cEmerald City,\u201d an off-the-chain development with revolving around a lake in the center of town, surrounded by piers, bike\u00a0paths, casinos, etc., whose treated water will serve as a reservoir for use among the local residents. There is also a mini-rail line in the works, which could involve the participation of Blockchains Inc.\nMore details about software startup Blockchains, LLC\u2019s research and development project are are expected to emerge next month in an official announcement.\nTech Disrupters\nThe purchase gives the startup, which was legally registered in 2017, an anchor position on a campus that is comprised of 107,000 acres across 100+ businesses. According to reports, Jeffrey Berns of the law group Berns Weiss, of which he is co-founder of the currency practice, is a part-owner of Blockchains, LLC.\nBlockchains, LLC, whose attorney reportedly said the company will remain in \u201cstealth mode\u201d till\u00a0Q2 2018, has a larger plot than Google, which in 2017 acquired more than 1,200 acres, Switch\u2019s 2,000 acres and Tesla, whose Gigafactory for lithium-ion batteries are produced on nearly 3,000 acres of land.

Bitcoin alone processes $8 billion on a daily basis and has more liquidity than the most liquid stock on earth, Apple.\nNelms added that the only use case of bitcoin he personally sees is money laundering and financial crime, stating, \u201cor if someone steals our credit card numbers they\u2019re going to ask for payments in Bitcoin. Those are the only use cases I\u2019m actually seeing today.\u201d\nOn a factual level, the argument of Nelms that the primary usage of bitcoin as a money laundering tool for Chinese investors is highly incorrect because the Chinese government imposed a strict ban on cryptocurrency trading in September 2017. As of now, the Chinese market is nearly zero trading volume, and the largest cryptocurrency markets are the US, Japan, and South Korea.\nIsolation\nEarlier this week, Robinhood, a major US-based financial services company that allows individuals to invest in publicly traded companies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), announced its plans to launch a cryptocurrency exchange by next month.\nRobinhood developers have already updated the company\u2019s mobile app to add a feature showing the prices of 14 major cryptocurrencies.\u00a0Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest financial conglomerate and bank in Japan, also revealed its finalized plans to launch a cryptocurrency exchange within 2018, to address the rapidly increasing demand for bitcoin from institutional investors and retail traders.\nThe cryptocurrency market is an exponentially growing sector with tens of millions of both individual and institutional investors across the globe eager to invest. Failing to flow with the modern trend and address growing demand from cryptocurrency investors could result in Discover losing its market share to other competitors in the market like Visa, which have been pro-cryptocurrency since 2015.\nBut, Discover emphasized that if everyday cardholders push for the integration and support of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum, it will consider implementing them in the long-term. For now, Nelms explained that Discover customers are not \u201cclamoring to use it.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Christopher Giancarlo expressed their disapproval over the manner in which many market participants in the distributed ledger technology (DLT) space flout regulations and attempt to circumvent rules governing investor protection.\n\u201c[T]oday we are seeing substantial DLT-related market activity that shows little or no regard to our proven regulatory approach. This concerns us,\u201d Clayton and Giancarlo wrote. \u201cSome proponents of cryptocurrencies note that the jurisdiction of the CFTC and SEC over cryptocurrency transactions is limited and cite the absence of U.S. and other government market regulation as an investment attribute. Such claims should give prospective investors pause.\u201d\nClayton and Giancarlo took lawyers, trading platforms, and financial services firms to task for their behavior, which the two regulators said \u201cdisturbed\u201d them in many cases. In particular, they repeated the oft-stated-but-rarely-heeded statement that merely wrapping an investment product in new terminology does not exempt it from regulations governing securities and investor protection.\n\u201cMarket participants, including lawyers, trading venues and financial services firms, should be aware that we are disturbed by many examples of form being elevated over substance, with form-based arguments depriving investors of mandatory protections,\u201d they said.\nNotably, Clayton and Giancarlo said that they would like to \u201crevisit\u201d frameworks under which cryptocurrency exchanges other trading platforms have registered as payment services, which are regulated primarily at the state level and do not provide federal regulators with direct oversight.\n\u201cMany of the internet-based cryptocurrency-trading platforms have registered as payment services and are not subject to direct oversight by the SEC or the CFTC,\u201d they said. \u201cWe would support policy efforts to revisit these frameworks and ensure they are effective and efficient for the digital era.\u201d\nBoth agencies have been steadily ramping up their oversight of the nascent blockchain space. Last week, the CFTC brought charges against several cryptocurrency-related investment schemes that regulators said were fraudulent, while the SEC has shut down several ICOs for failing to register as securities.\nFor Clayton, this op-ed marked the second time this week that he had issued public comments about the failure of market \u201cgatekeepers\u201d to act responsibly within the DLT space. On Monday, he said that, \u201cparticularly in the initial coin offering space, they can do better\u201d and added that he had instructed SEC staff to be on \u201chigh alert\u201d for \u201cICOs that may be contrary to the spirit of our securities laws.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

Yuji Nakamura, a technology reporter based in Japan, reported that the CoinCheck trading platform had not implemented multi-signature technology, stored all of the hacked funds in a hot wallet, and that the developers of CoinCheck are still not sure how the exchange was hacked.\nMost major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Bitfinex have multi-signature security measures in place, which prevent funds from being processed on public blockchain networks until a third party security service provider confirm the legitimacy of transactions.\nFor instance, Kraken and Bitstamp have partnered with BitGo, the largest multi-signature technology and blockchain security firm in the industry, to ensure that hackers cannot withdraw funds from their platforms.\nThe lack of a multi-signature service is a critical security flaw for any cryptocurrency exchange. If multi-signature technology was integrated, the $530 million security breach could have been prevented.\nIn addition to not having implemented multi-signature security measures, CoinCheck kept all of its funds in a hot wallet. In cryptocurrency, a hot wallet is defined as a wallet that is connected to the Internet, while a cold wallet is described as a wallet which is stored offline. For large sums of user funds, cryptocurrency exchanges usually store cryptocurrencies in cold storage, to ensure that even in an event of a hacking attack, hackers cannot access user funds.\nThe malpractice of CoinCheck of storing funds in a hot wallet and not implementing a multi-signature system ultimately led to the loss of $530 million in user funds.\nThroughout the press conference, CoinCheck executives and its CEO refused to admit that the exchange was not secure, despite the obvious weaknesses in its infrastructure. Nakamura noted:\n\nOnly NEM was impacted\nCoinCheck plans to continue operating\nNot decided on how to reimburse customers\nNo Multi-Signature\nWould not admit security was weak\nNot sure how it was hacked\n\nIt was also revealed that CoinCheck had not filed with the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) because it was confident in its security measures. Yet, the CoinCheck development team is yet to understand how the trading platform was hacked.\nIf the method of a security breach cannot be unraveled, the exchanges cannot possibly add necessary improvements to prevent similar attacks from happening in the future. \nDo Not Store Funds on Exchanges\nGiven the poor and weak infrastructure of CoinCheck, a large-scale hacking attack was inevitable. Developers of the company are likely relieved that other cryptocurrencies on the trading platform such as Ripple or bitcoin were not affected.\nAs a general rule of cryptocurrency investment, it is extremely insecure to leave funds on centralized platforms. The most secure way of storing cryptocurrencies is to leave them on non-custodial platforms, wherein users have absolute control over their private keys.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

In a blog post on its website, the company stated that the cryptocurrency is one of the several other tokens that are also scheduled to be added in the near future.\nLitecoin, released in October 2011 by former Google employee, Charlie Lee, was introduced as a lighter alternative to bitcoin. It is one of the oldest cryptocurrencies currently on the market and has a market cap of close to $10 billion. In December 2017, Litecoin reached an all time high price of around $350.\nLitecoin is the second cryptocurrency that has been added to Zebpay over the past few weeks. Earlier in January 2018, the company rolled out the ability for users to trade Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\nUsers of Zebpay that held any amount of bitcoin prior to the Bitcoin Cash hard fork on August 1, 2017 were also given an equivalent amount of BCH once the cryptocurrency was added to the platform. Some customers, however, were able to withdraw their Bitcoin Cash balances to their external wallets as early as November 2017. On December 14, Zebpay withdrew the option of sending the forked cryptocurrency to other wallets in favor of crediting the balance to its own trading platform once released. The company held up its end of the bargain once Bitcoin Cash trading became available through its mobile app though.\nImportantly, though, Zebpay does not offer cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency pairings on its trading platform`. Converting between different digital currencies requires the user to first \u2018sell\u2019 their holdings for fiat equivalent, making the entire process susceptible to market volatility.\nAccording to Zebpay\u2019s November newsletter, the company will also be introducing Ripple and Ethereum to its exchange. Based on the time interval between the addition of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, it may only be a couple of months before all four digital currencies can be traded on the platform.\nAs of December 2017, Zebpay serves over 2 million users with that number expected to rise in the near future. Furthermore, the Zebpay mobile app has found great success on the Android and iOS marketplaces beating other finance applications owned by private sector banks in the country. It faces tough competition from other platform-agnostic exchanges, however, including the likes of Koinex and Coinsecure. The former supports other cryptocurrencies as well, including Golem, IOTA and OmiseGO.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

Last year, the number one digital currency saw its value rise by over 1,700 percent, with the culmination of December seeing bitcoin within touching distance of $20,000 for the first time.\nHeightened interest from retail and institutional investors has meant that there is increasing concern among regulators that the currency is in a bubble due to its volatility. Not only that, but there remains a strong perception that the crypto market is being used among criminals.\nJust yesterday it was reported that Tokyo-based digital currency exchange Coincheck had been hacked, resulting in the theft of $530 million worth of NEM, and making it the biggest cryptocurrency theft in history.\nSituations like this are what are fuelling the demand for more oversight within the market. However, while countries such as China and South Korea are tightening their stance around digital currency trading, demand for cryptocurrencies continues.\nSince record highs with bitcoin last month the currency has slumped in value, and in recent weeks has been struggling to regain highs above $11,000. Now, though, it what has been a slight upward shift, major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum have seen their prices increase. Earlier today it was reported that the two had posted five percent gains.\nAt the time of publishing, bitcoin\u2019s value is trading at $11,489, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum is once again priced above $1,000, at $1,100.\nThe fact remains, however, that the start of 2018 has not been the best of beginnings for the cryptocurrency market, with many still arguing that it seems like a bubble.

Donations sent to MAPS will be matched up to $4 million, while donations sent to the Erowid Center will be matched up to $250,000 until March 10.\nThe Pineapple Fund has Already Donated $34 Million\nThe donor behind the Pineapple Fund, known as \u201cPine,\u201d has notably already donated over $34 million to 41 organizations. All of the donations are sent in BTC, which brings the tax advantage of sending the full amount, without being assessed capital gains taxes. Pine does not take any tax deductions for the donations.\nPine has in the past revealed that there are three main considerations for supporting a charity. These are how impactful their work is, what innovation they provide, and their efficiency, size, and sustainability.\nSome of its donations include $1 million to the Water Project, which provides clean water to people in Sub-Saharan Africa, $5 million to a basic income experiment that will help rural Kenyans trapped in extreme poverty, and $1 million to the Internet Archive, a non-profit created to build an Internet library.\nThe Pineapple Fund has also donated to organizations to support universal health care, research and treatments for aging, education for disadvantaged children worldwide, and to provide stable housing worldwide. On Reddit, Pine has stated that people who want to donate to charity should do so.", "category": "News"}

In a blog post by Facebooks\u2019 Rob Leathern, the social media giant is trumpeting a new policy, banning ads that \u201cpromote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices.\u201d\nWithout a clear regulatory framework for ICOs, Facebook is just trying to protect its users \u2014 of which there were 2.7 billion as of Q2 2017 \u2014 and prevent bad actors from promoting their scams on the site. The policy is a broad-brush approach for the time being but seems to target sketchy ads making unrealistic claims and flying in the face of expert advice from blockchain veterans not to invest more than you can afford to lose in any digital coin.\n\nThey point to \u201cmany companies\u201d that are advertising ICOs and cryptocurrencies, as well as binary options, that aren\u2019t on the up-and-up.\n\u201cThis policy is intentionally broad while we work to better detect deceptive and misleading advertising practices, and enforcement will begin to ramp up across our platforms including Facebook, Audience Network and Instagram. We will revisit this policy and how we enforce it as our signals improve.\u201d\u00a0 \u2014 Facebook\nIt\u2019s unclear if Twitter or other social media sites will follow suit with similar ad guidelines.\nFlurry of Reasons\nWith a lack of clear regulation for upcoming ICOs, Facebook must have felt it had to do something. Meanwhile, they\u2019re parroting some of the same concerns that blockchain veterans have similarly expressed.\nWences Casares, head of bitcoin wallet startup Xapo, recently reminded investors not to put more into ICOs than they can afford to lose, which supports Facebook\u2019s ban of\u00a0ads that urge people to redirect their retirement savings into token sales. Ethereum and Ripple founders have similarly been vocal about warning investors about possible scams circulating in the cryptocurrency industry.\nAnother ad that Facebook is targeting is the one that promises the absence of risk. That seems to have been the approach of Bitconnect, which was guaranteeing fixed returns and has since been hit with its second class action lawsuit claiming an investment scam.\nFacebook\u2019s ICO and cryptocurrency ad ban come on the heels of a warning issued by SEC and CFTC chiefs Jay Clayton and\u00a0Christopher Giancarlo, respectively, to the cryptocurrency industry. They admonished the industry participants who capitalize on the \u201climited\u201d jurisdictional reach of the regulators, touting this as an attractive feature by which to invest in a digital coin.

Today it\u2019s worth a few hundred dollars.\nIt points to defendant Ryan Maasen of Tulsa, Okla. as the ringleader of the alleged scam, using YouTube videos to promote the company and \u201cconvince people to deposit money onto Bitconnect\u2019s website,\u201d which Paige and a host of others did.

Armstrong responded that Coinbase will add SegWit, batching transactions, and other innovative solutions to improve the backlog of transactions on the bitcoin network.\nIn December, Coinbase employees and contractors were accused by many members of the bitcoin community for insider trading. George Kikvadze, vice chairman at Bitfury, described the sudden surge in the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) moments prior to the Coinbase integration of BCH as a \u201cvery shady move.\u201d Armstrong responded that while digital currency prices fluctuate quite a lot, there was no indication of any wrongdoing.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

This surge saw the cryptocurrency gain 35% in a matter of hours.\nA Next-Generation Blockchain\nHaving concluded its token sale and airdrop in October 2017, the Ardor Blockchain Platform launched as planned, on January 1st 2018, 00:00:00 UTC. The Ardor blockchain is a next generation blockchain that enables the addition of child chains. These child chains can retain their unique functionalities simultaneously while resident on, and enjoying the security of the parent Ardor blockchain.\nCryptocurrency and Economics\nGenerally, the value of cryptocurrencies are fundamentally determined by the economic forces of supply and demand. Therefore, since available tokens of cryptos are usually fixed per time, it is only natural that improved accessibility will most likely give rice to increased demand. Consequently, this increase in demand results to more scarcity, thereby causing the prices of such tokens to rise in price.\nOne of the most significant ways of improving token accessibility is by listing such tokens on exchanges, especially the top exchanges. This is a phenomenon that has displayed such consistency that it almost seems like a law in the crypto world. Major crytpocurrency exchanges like Bitterex, Poloniex, Changelly, Bitfinex, e.t.c are almost seen as symbols of approval, especially for new and developing cryptocurrencies.\nBitterex\u00a0Listing\nThe price surge of the Ignis token therefore is connected with the announcement of it being listed on the Bitterex exchange. On its twitter handle, Ignis announced being listed of Bitterex of its token as it expects trading to begin soon.\n\nThis is a major listing of which several more will be expected in future dates. However, the crypto marketplace has once again remained consistent with its behaviour as listing on a major exchange initiates significant increase in price.

The societal backlash against the proposed ban even saw the Executive Office of the President weigh in on the matter, cooling fears of a blanket ban.

The justice ministry found little support from other governmental ministries including the ministry of finance which refused to endorse a ban on cryptocurrency trading and exchanges.\nIn a public radio interview this month, the chairman of Korea\u2019s economic competition regulator disputed the very notion of a ban, effectively stating it would be illegal for the government to enforce such measures.\nKorea\u2019s Fair Trade Commission chairman Kim Sang-Joo stated:\n\u201c[Shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges] is not realistically possible.

{"title": "The SEC on ICOs and Cryptocurrency: A Rocky But Optimistic Ride", "url": "https://www.ccn.com/the-sec-on-icos-and-cryptocurrency-a-rocky-but-optimistic-ride/", "birthday": "2018-01-28T13:18:30+00:00", "date": "2018-01-28 13:18:30", "year": 2018, "month": 1, "day": 28, "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been very cautious in its statements on ICOs and cryptocurrency as they attempt to strike a balance between embracing a technological revolution\u00a0and avoiding the stifling of innovation. They aren\u2019t seeking to dismember the cryptocurrency space, but rather provide guidance on how to operate and comply with existing regulatory requirements.\nHowever, companies have been caught between wishing to hold an ICO open to U.S. investors for a utility token \u2013 or one that provides functionality on a platform without the guarantee of trading or an investment return, and not drawing the ire of the government.\nThere have been plenty of ways in which companies have erred on the side of caution, most notably with the Simple Agreements for Future Tokens.\nThe creation of the Simple Agreements for Future Tokens or SAFT by law firm Cooley was an unofficial way of navigating the regulatory landscape in order to have a secure way of selling an ICO to accredited investors and venture capital firms. A play on the SAFE agreement (Simple Agreement for Future Equity), the SAFT seeks to lessen the risk of the sale, as the tokens are deliverable upon the actual completion of the network or protocol. Pre-functional tokens are not issued at any time.\nThe point of the SAFT was to open up sales to accredited U.S. investors, while keeping a barrier to the general public. However, it was as Jerry Brito puts it in his article: a \u201cSymptom of Regulatory Uncertainty.\u201d It allows a tip-toeing of the legal landscape outlined by the SEC by betting on both the potential for a token to be a security or utility.\nBut the burning question remains: how does the SEC truly feel about ICOs and cryptocurrency? They\u2019ve been recently more vocal about having companies register with them, but a binary has yet to surface.\nTo understand how the SEC feels about ICOs and cryptocurrencies requires a step back to the summer when the SEC released their first major statement \u2013 notably on The DAO.\nThe DAO \u2013 The SEC Goes Public on Cryptocurrency\nBack in the summer of 2017, the SEC released their first public report on ICOs, namely on The DAO, which was one of the most high-profile token sales due to a vulnerability which left millions of dollars in Ethereum\u00a0stolen, and gave birth to Ethereum Classic.\nIt was quite obvious that The DAO offered a form of unlicensed security \u2013 it was the equivalent of a decentralized venture capital fund that provided a form of return on an initial investment. This was a clear failure of the Howey Test, which has become the general litmus test of whether or not a token being offered in a sale is a utility token or security.\nThe importance of this report was the fact that it provided a bit of optimism in the community. The SEC could\u2019ve simply shut down ICOs altogether after this clear violation. They instead chose to offer options to keep those who wish to hold ICOs on the side of compliance.\nThe investor bulletin released the same day on ICOs provided a background on both the process of token sales, and a large \u201cif\u201d statement regarding coins that could potentially be considered securities:\nDepending on the facts and circumstances of each individual ICO, the virtual coins or tokens that are offered or sold may be securities.\u00a0 If they are securities, the offer and sale of these virtual coins or tokens in an ICO are subject to the federal securities laws.\nThis kept the door open to many entities looking to hold a compliant token sale by offering a form of utility token. The SEC understood the innovation happening in the blockchain space, and knew an outright ban would possibly stifle progress. At the same time, they needed to provide investors with a bit of information to protect them from the ever-present scam offerings.\nOver the next few months, the SEC would begin building up their Cyber Unit to deal with ICOs soliciting U.S. investors and offering unlicensed securities. The first move came in August when an ICO by the name of Protostarr took down their website in order to comply and refund investors after raising 119.6 Ether. Shortly after this, the SEC came out with their first major press release targeting a scammer in New York looking to raise money by selling tokenized assets.\nBlatant Violations and SEC Stings \nIn September, the SEC flexed its muscles and took down two blatant scams run by a businessman in New York City. Maksim Zaslavskiy and his organization raised money in two fraudulent ICOs: REcoin Group Foundation, and DRC World \u2013 both of which looked to tokenize assets and provide an ROI. The SEC then froze Zaslavskiy\u2019s assets, and charged him with violations of the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws.\nAfter that, the next large sting by the SEC came in December when they froze the assets of PlexCoin \u2013 a $15 million ICO that promised \u201c13-fold profit in less than a month.\u201d These low hanging fruits allowed the SEC to set a precedent and deter scammers from operating highly-illegal offerings. This sting also allowed the SEC to come forward and display the results of their newly established \u201cCyber Unit,\u201d that has a hand in taking down fraudulent ICOs.\nFollowing PlexCoin\u2019s takedown was most likely the largest intervention by the SEC to date: Munchee Inc. Munchee is a California-based company that was seeking to raise $15 million in an ICO, offering a token used to buy and sell goods and services\nWhere Munchee slipped up were its promotions of returns on the investment, as the efforts of the company would \u201clead to an increase in value of the tokens\u201d \u2013 a clear failure of the Howey Test. The company has since returned investor proceeds and never issued tokens.\nOn the same day, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton released a statement on both cryptocurrency and initial coin offerings to help guide \u201cMain Street Investors,\u201d and \u201cMarket Professionals.\u201d He urged retail investors to exercise caution when presented with an offering that might \u2018sound too good to be true,\u2019 considering the number of scams propagating in the space. To market professionals, Clayton acknowledged the power of ICOs as fundraising vehicles for innovative projects. His main driving-point was to urge professionals to read the previously issued reports and releases, and to comply with existing regulations to ensure that laws are being followed.\nAgain, cautious but optimistic.\nClayton and Giancarlo: Create Efficient Regulation\nEarlier this week, both Clayton and J. Christopher Giancarlo (Chairman of the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission), penned an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal as a public statement and warning to both regulators and investors on cryptocurrency. In the piece, both Clayton and Giancarlo continually reason with readers to let them know that they understand the impact of blockchain technology, but sternly underpin it with warnings to those looking to circumvent any guidance they\u2019ve since provided.\nOur task, as market regulators, is to set and enforce rules that foster innovation while promoting market integrity and confidence. \nHowever, a portion of the article was dedicated to a conversation on changing existing frameworks in order to ease the process and provide proper guidance to all things cryptocurrency related. Although they must be stern, this piece reaffirmed their willingness to work with the community and keep domestic innovation alive. They understand how quickly the space is moving and would like to work with it rather than against it. At the same time, their goal is to protect investors from malicious characters raising funds, which is why the tone is understandable.\nIn a perfect world for the SEC, every domestic ICO registers through one of their various outlets including but not limited to Regulation A+, but the future might see a distinct split between those who continue to offer utility tokens in ICOs, and those who go the registered securities route.\nSecurity Tokens on the Rise \u2013 the Future Cryptocurrency Landscape \nWith the SEC being a bit more active in providing guidance, SEC complaint token sales might be a regular occurrence in the near future. Even major players like Kodak have come out to stake a claim in the growing cryptocurrency space by offering a security token of their own.\nWith the rise of security tokens, tZERO, a subsidiary of Overstock, has launched their own security token ICO, with the hopes of eventually creating the first SEC regulated cryptocurrency alternative trading system (ATS). By providing a trading platform for security tokens in the future, tZERO will most likely open the floodgates for other companies seeking to raise capital in an ICO and provide an SEC-compliant security token sale.\nHowever, even with security tokens, this shouldn\u2019t be treated as the end of utility tokens. Rather, the future might hold concurrent markets for both security and utility tokens, each catering to a subset of investors. What should be interesting, is seeing both the companies that capitalize on the opportunity to hold compliant security token sales, and the restructuring of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization between utility and security tokens.\nThe SEC hasn\u2019t put a damper on ICOs, but rather are looking to protect investors, offer legal ways in which companies can utilize an ICO as a fundraising method, and weed out scams in the space. It seems as if it\u2019s going to be smooth sailing for a bit \u2013 but always remember to be prepared for a storm.", "category": "ICO News"}

The recent surge in the price of Ether can be attributed to the progress the Ethereum open-source development community has led in scaling the network.\n\nAs shown by Etherscan, the Ethereum network is processing more than a million transactions per day. At its peak, the Ethereum network settled over 1.4 million transactions within 24 hours, demonstrating a daily transaction volume that is seven times larger than that of the Bitcoin network.\nThe increase in the daily transaction volume of the Ethereum network reflects the exponential growth rate of decentralized applications launched on top of the Ethereum protocol. Applications like EtherDelta, 0x, Radar Relay, and CryptoCribs have gained a significant amount of active users over the past few months.\nThis week, $1.6 billion cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong praised CryptoCribs, a decentralized Ethereum-based Airbnb-like platform with a non-ICO model. In the cryptocurrency industry, it is difficult to find commercially successful decentralized applications that had not conducted initial coin offerings (ICOs), because ICO has become an easy cash grab for developers.\nIn July of 2017, Aragon co-founder Luis Cuenda stated that he does not know any Ethereum developer who is not a millionaire yet due to the ICO market.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any good Ethereum developer that isn\u2019t a millionaire \u2014 There\u2019s a gold rush among developers to learn the coding language of money,\u201d Cuende stated.\nAs Cuende noted, evidently, there is a gold rush amongst developers, venture capitals, large conglomerates, and large-scale investors to dive into the Ethereum market. The demand for ICOs have increased to a point in which blockchain startups have stopped launching public ICOs. Today, only whitelisted investors and institutional investors can invest in most ICOs.\nAdditionally, as the scalability of the Ethereum network continues to improve through innovative solutions like Sharding and Plasma, Ethereum will be able to provide a better infrastructure and ecosystem for decentralized applications.\nThe price and the market valuation of Ethereum solely depend on the performance and adoption of decentralized applications launched on the Ethereum protocol. If decentralized applications continue to perform well, the price of Ether will reflect the success of decentralized applications.\nTrend of the Market\nWhile the cryptocurrency market has demonstrated optimistic signs of short-term recovery over the past week, it is still down $240 billion from its monthly peak at $820 billion. At $586 billion, major cryptocurrencies in the global market such as bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and Cardano will have to record massive gains in the upcoming weeks to bring the market to its previous highs.\nBut, cryptocurrencies like Ripple and Bitcoin Cash are down by more than 50 percent from their all-time highs and the with the exception of bitcoin and Ethereum, most major cryptocurrenices have not performed well.\nBased on a variety of factors such as the entrance of institutional investors through bitcoin futures and the adoption of cryptocurrencies by large-scale financial firms including Robinhood, analysts remain enthusiastic regarding the short-term growth trend of the cryptocurrency market.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

The opportunity cost of finding someone with something you want, while at the same time having something they want, is very time-consuming. \u00a0Finding someone with a BLT that also wants an economic lesson would be very inefficient. \u00a0Money solves that problem.\nHow do Economists Define Money?\nAll the economics books start out with the 3 functions of money: medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account.\nThe most important function of money is the medium of exchange. Sellers accept it in exchange for goods and services. \u00a0As stated previously, without money, societies must resort to barter.\nMoney must also be a store of value. If you sell something or provide your labor, you want to be able to save that purchasing power for later. \u00a0Inflation or devaluation erodes money as a viable store of value.\nThe third function of money is the unit of account. \u00a0Money must be able to provide a measurement to assess the value of goods and services. \u00a0Essentially, it\u2019s a yardstick to compare prices of goods and services and it provides a measurable signal in the constant shuffling of the allocation of resources. \nAnything that provides those function will be a good money. \u00a0Whether that is rectangular pieces of cotton paper, digits on a computer, large stone wheels or shells, if it functions as money, it is money.\nTypes of Money\nEcon 101 also defines the different types of money. \u00a0Usually, they focus on three types: \u00a0commodity money, representative money, and fiat money.\nCommodity money is money that also has value as a commodity. \u00a0Cattle, cigarettes, and gems would be an example of this. \u00a0Representative money is money backed by, or exchangeable for, a valuable item such as gold or silver. \u00a0Tether being backed by the US dollar could be an example of this.\nFiat money is money that is created by government fiat, or order. \u00a0It is a governmental decree that declares this form of money valuable without having any inherent, intrinsic value. \u00a0Governments usually make this type of money the only way to pay your taxes. This obviously gives it some important utility and a reason for us to accept this seemingly absurd order.\nFinally, economists\u00a0have narrowed down a few characteristics that make for a good money: \u00a0Durability, portability, divisibility, stability in value, scarcity, acceptability.\nPutting Bitcoin to the Test\nLet\u2019s create a simple assessment rubric and put bitcoin to the test. We can gauge it on a 30 point scale with 10 points for each category: \u00a0functions, type, and characteristics.\nFunctions\u00a0\u2013 Not many people accept bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Recent headlines have stated that a few big-name businesses have stopped accepting it. More research would be needed to quantify the rate of change in world acceptability. That being said, its current ease of convertibility to fiat should not be discounted. \u00a0Essentially, one can use bitcoin anywhere that the Visa logo is accepted with debit cards that convert your bitcoin to fiat at the point of sale. \u00a0This is not true in all countries.\nOn the store of value front, bitcoin is still extremely volatile. \u00a0If you bought bitcoin after the Thanksgiving spike for $19,000, it has been a horrible store of value. \u00a0If you bought bitcoin before 2017, it has been one of the greatest stores of value ever. \u00a0But generally, extreme volatility is not a good trait when aiming to provide this function.\nBitcoin hasn\u2019t been much of a unit of account, but you could argue that it is evolving into a type of unit of account to measure and buy other cryptocurrencies. Surely, some people have negotiated services, labor or goods solely with bitcoin being the yardstick but it\u2019s still a relatively small number.\nScore \u2013 6 out of 10 for functions of money.\nCharacteristics\u2013 \u00a0Bitcoin is extremely portable, perfectly divisible, durable and scare. \u00a0It is a perfect money in those regards. \u00a0But once again, bitcoin lacks stability and acceptability.\nScore \u2013 8 out of 10 for characteristics\nTypes of Money- \u00a0The types of money serves as kind of a precedent for what has been money in the past. \u00a0Essentially most money has been either commodity, representative or fiat money. Bitcoin is not a commodity, doesn\u2019t represent anything valuable and is definitely not fiat. \u00a0The only argument I see it that bitcoin represents all the computer, energy and manpower in the mining system that keeps the system honest. \u00a0Since it\u2019s so new, there is no precedent with this form of money. \u00a0Crypto is a new type of money and surely future textbooks will include them. \u00a0But as of now, it doesn\u2019t fall into any classification of money types in Econ 101.\nScore \u2013 4 out of 10 for money type\nBitcoin scores a D-\nAccording to this rubric, bitcoin scores an 18 out of 30 for money. This is 60%, a D-. \u00a0The value of bitcoin today represents the collective analysis of all bitcoin market participants. One of the reasons it\u2019s not 50,000 a coin now is because it\u2019s unstable and lacks widespread acceptability. If bitcoin becomes more stable and more accepted, it can serve more of the utility that this type of money represents. \u00a0Bitcoin needs to improve the stability and acceptability to service those markets. \u00a0This is likely to happen. \u00a0Other cryptos are right behind, trying to do it better, and many governments are actively trying to disrupt the acceptability function. \u00a0It will be interesting to watch. \u00a0\nWhat grade would you give it?", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Schultz also expressed his doubt that bitcoin will be one of them, saying \u201cI don\u2019t believe that bitcoin is going to be a currency today or in the future.\u201d\nSchultz joins a group of recent high-profile bitcoin skeptics that includes legendary investor Warren Buffett, Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller, and J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon (who went so far as to call out bitcoin \u201ca fraud\u201d although he later stepped back\u00a0from those comments). However, unlike many of these skeptics, Schultz\u2019s critique of bitcoin was mostly based on its utility as an actual currency. Regardless of one\u2019s opinion on cryptocurrency in general, this is not a particularly controversial viewpoint. The extreme price volatility of bitcoin and most other digital tokens has severely limited their usefulness for simple, day-to-day consumer transactions like buying gas, groceries, or a cup of coffee.\nSo, does all this mean that Starbucks is getting ready to dip its toe into the world of crypto? Unfortunately for blockchain enthusiasts, the answer is no. During the call Schultz was quick to clarify, saying \u201cI\u2019m not bringing this up because Starbucks is announcing that we are forming a digital currency or we\u2019re investing in this.\u201d Rather than signaling a desire for internal blockchain investment, the comments were intended to shed some light on the future of the company\u2019s digital payments strategy. Starbucks has already experienced rapid growth in its Mobile Order and Pay service, and current CEO Kevin Johnson revealed that the company has recently been testing a no-cash policy in one of its downtown Seattle locations. \nSchultz clearly believes that blockchain will play an important part in that strategy in the future, illustrated by his further comments during the call:\n\n\u201c\u2026we are heading into a new age, in which Blockchain technology is going to provide a significant level of a digital currency that is going to have a consumer application. And I believe that Starbucks is in a unique position to take advantage of that\u2026 We think we have something to offer the companies that are chasing this because we are in a position to create the trusted legitimate place in which this could be accepted and possibly take advantage of the mobile payment digital platform that we have created.\u201d\n\nGiven the power of the Starbucks brand and the leading role they have played in increased consumer acceptance of digital payments for daily purchases, any blockchain currency that receives their full support would have a huge advantage over competing tokens.", "category": "ICO News"}

According to WWF, it\u2019s believed that consumers will favour this method of transparency through the blockchain as it gets adopted by the entire tuna industry, which in turn will help to wipe out illegal operators who also use slave labour.\nBrett \u2018Blu\u201d Haywood,\u00a0Sea Quest Fiji CEO, added:\nSustainable fishing ensures the longevity of the fishing business, and Sea Quest wants to see sustainable fishing in the region. This blockchain project with the three WWF offices certainly gives the industry the best opportunity going forward.\nThe WWF and Sea Quest are now seeking a retailer to partner in the project, enabling the completion of the tuna\u2019s traceability story.", "category": "Blockchain News"}

Gox theft.\nBecause Coincheck kept most of its funds in internet-connected \u201chot wallets\u201d rather than in offline \u201ccold wallets, which are more secure, the hacker was able to steal approximately 523 million XEM \u2014 the native token of the NEM network \u2014 worth $530 million at the time of the theft.\nThe gravity of the theft left many wondering whether the FSA would strengthen its oversight of the country\u2019s other cryptocurrency trading platforms, and the revelation that it may conduct on-site investigations at other exchanges appears to confirm that it will.\nIn addition to ramping up its oversight of the nascent cryptocurrency trading industry, the FSA also ordered Coincheck to enhance its security policies and submit a report detailing the reason for the hack and measures to prevent it from reoccurring in the future. The exchange must fulfill these obligations by February 13.\nCoincheck to Partially Reimburse Customers, and NEM Won\u2019t Fork\nCoincheck has also said that intends to partially reimburse 260,000 customers who lost funds as a result of the hack.

However, the company has provided a detailed payment plan for this compensation.\nNotably, although the hack appears to have been isolated to Coincheck\u2019s NEM wallet, the NEM Foundation has stated that it will not conduct a hard fork to recover the stolen funds.

Once the integration is complete, existing WeMakePrice users will be able to purchase items and services using cryptocurrencies.\nWhile Bithumb is leading the integration process of various cryptocurrencies into the system of WeMakePrice, users do not have to be registered with Bithumb to use cryptocurrencies on the WeMakePrice platform. Since cryptocurrencies will be integrated into its existing infrastructure, users can pay for goods using the same application.\nIn an interview with South Korean mainstream media outlet HanKyoReh, a WeMakePrice spokesperson stated that the company has come to the decision of integrating cryptocurrencies as a part of a larger initiative to ease the payment process for general consumers.\n\u201cIntegrating cryptocurrencies is a part of our initiative to make payments more convenient for our consumers and clients.

He said:\n\u201cI personally believe that there is going to be a one or a few legitimate trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology. And that legitimacy and trust in terms of its consumer application will have to be legitimized by a brand and a brick and mortar environment, where the consumer has trust and confidence in the company that is providing the transaction.\u201d\nSchultz emphasized that Starbucks is not interested in creating a cryptocurrency of its own, unlike several conglomerates in the technology and finance sector. Since the value of cryptocurrencies come from the decentralized nature and security value of public blockchains, the development of a company-specific cryptocurrency would be highly inefficient.\nBut, Schultz and Starbucks are awaiting for a cryptocurrency that large-scale retailers are willing to embrace as a payment method that is also easily accessible by the public.\nLast week, $9 billion payments company Stripe reaffirmed its optimism towards cryptocurrencies launched on top of Ethereum that are optimized to handle payments for retailers, like OmiseGo. The Stripe team stated:\n\u201cOmiseGO is an ambitious and clever proposal; more broadly, Ethereum continues to spawn many high-potential projects. We may add support for Stellar (to which we provided seed funding) if substantive use continues to grow.\u201d\nLast year, OmiseGo secured a partnership with McDonald\u2019s Thailand, to process payments for the McDonald\u2019s online delivery platform. Although many cryptocurrencies in the market are being used for payments, Schultz reaffirmed that he does not see bitcoin becoming adopted as a currency in the future.\n\u201cWell, I think I have another question for you: Twenty or so years later, and the question is, the issue of do you understand and are you anticipating what could happen with cryptocurrencies? And the reason I mention this is not because I\u2019m talking about Bitcoin, because I don\u2019t believe that Bitcoin is going to be a currency today or in the future,\u201d Schultz added.\nBitcoin Adoption in Japan\nIn Japan, bitcoin is already well-adopted by retailers. The country\u2019s largest electronic retailer Bic Camera, leading budget airline Peach, and hotel chain Capsule have been accepting bitcoin since mid-2017, almost immediately after the Japanese government legalized and approved bitcoin as a currency.\nBitcoin is being used as a peer-to-peer currency in many regions outside of Japan as well. In South Korea and the Philippines, bitcoin is frequently utilized as a remittance method to send payments from one country to another.\nSchultz declined to comment on his pessimistic stance towards bitcoin but based from his comments, it is likely that he is concerned with the congestion of the Bitcoin network and its fees, like Stripe and other companies in the traditional finance sector. \nIn the long-term, innovative scaling solutions could allow bitcoin to function as a stable and an efficient digital currency.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

At present, the Bitcoin price is trading at $11,262 on Bitfinex, which represents a 24-hour decline of five percent and provides the most prominent cryptocurrency with a $189 billion market cap.\nEthereum Price Cools Off\nThe Ethereum price followed a similar trajectory, declining four percent to $1,181 following a significant weekend rally that had lifted it as high as $1,260.

Datatrek Research\u2019s Nick Colas, an early analyst to track bitcoin, suggested to CNBC that the key to unlocking bitcoin\u2019s next rally is to observe Google search and the ensuing digtal wallet creation, both of which have been on the decline in January amid a bevy of negative developments (exchange and wallet hacks, etc.) The bottom line? Google searches for bitcoin and wallet creation for the cryptocurrency this month compare poorly with December results.\nColas is not the first analyst to make the connection, with ARK Invest\u2019s Chris Burniske previously pointing to a BTC/USD exchange rate that clearly reflected Google search trends.\u00a0Burniske referred to it as \u201ca virtuous Satoshi cycle,\u201d\u00a0 evidence for which traces back to at least August 2017. Incidentally, today, a Google search of \u201cbitcoin\u201d yielded me 341 million results. Meanwhile, Colas said to CNBC:\n\u201cBy looking at the number of people who search for the word \u2018bitcoin\u2019 on Google, which has roughly a 60 percent market share of search globally, we get a pretty good sense of where the interest is,\u201d adding: \u201cThe data does show exactly the same price trends that we saw for the past 90 days.\u201d\nFewer people have been searching bitcoin, and that waning interest is being reflected in the bitcoin price, which is currently trading in the $10,000 \u2013 $12,000 range compared to nearly a $20,000 bitcoin price in December. Colas concludes that interest levels as determined by Google searches show definite support for bitcoin\u2019s \u201cbreakouts\u201d and \u201cpullbacks.\u201d\nSanta Claus Rally\nNeed further proof? In the United States, during the Thanksgiving holiday through Dec. 17, Google searches for bitcoin were the catalyst for the creation of bitcoin wallets to store the cryptocurrency. Colas says search trends \u201cskyrocketed\u201d during the period, rising more than twofold in a\u00a0couple of weeks\u00a0alongside the bitcoin price, to nearly $20,000. Of course, the strength in the bitcoin price didn\u2019t persist, and neither did the Google search demand, which showed a tapering off in the days following the bitcoin price high.\n\nAnother popular search term during the holidays was, \u201cbuy bitcoin with credit card,\u201d which incidentally Discover has addressed of late, dashing cardholders\u2019 hopes of trading bitcoin or any altcoin for that matter with their credit or debit card.\nThe reasons behind the weakening bitcoin search activity on Google are unclear, but the remedy could just be more positive developments out of the space, the details for which can be tougher to predict.\u00a0\u201cFrom this point on, we just have to look for the beginnings of good news that will re-accelerate wallet growth to make the thing go higher,\u201d said Colas.", "category": "Bitcoin Price News"}

The regulations are currently at a \u201cdrafting stage\u201d, Aquino said.\nIn quotes reported by Reuters, the SEC official added:\n\u201cWe need to act because initial coin offerings (ICOs) are sprouting especially in 2017.

You have to be extra careful how investors in this new space are protected.\u201d\nSpecifically, the regulation will introduce guidelines on the cybersecurity posture of cryptocurrency markets, the eligibility of ICO issuers accounting for the technology used and the operators behind it, as well as the financial literacy of investors, Aquino revealed.\nMost of all, the SEC chief insists that the regulatory move is to ensure investor safety while curbing fraud. \u201cUnfortunately, there have been a lot of cases where ICO promoters vanish into thin air,\u201d Aquino added. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that to happen here.\u201d As things stand, the securities regulator is yet to grant license or approval to an ICO operator and is reportedly investigating unverified, unlicensed sellers currently.

Today, on January 30, major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum dropped by nearly 5 percent.\n\nAdoption\nAs CCN reported yesterday, the current price trend of bitcoin and Ethereum do not accurately reflect the performance of both cryptocurrencies in terms of user activity, user base, and adoption. This week, two of Asia\u2019s largest retailers have announced support for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin.\nMost notably, South Korea\u2019s e-commerce platform WeMakePrice has started the integration process of 12 cryptocurrencies listed by Bithumb. Within a few weeks, millions of active users on WeMakePrice will be able to transact using bitcoin and 11 other cryptocurrencies.\nLast week, Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz stated that if cryptocurrencies cannot be adopted by retailers and merchants, they will fail to evolve into legitimate currencies. Already, despite the underlying scalability issues of most major cryptocurrencies, some of the largest retailers in Asia have started to integrate bitcoin and Ethereum.\nCurrently, the Bitcoin network is settling about 250,000 transactions per day while Ethereum is processing more than 1.2 million transactions on a daily basis. The integration of the two cryptocurrencies by major retailers could significantly increase their transaction volumes, given that the merchant adoption for leading cryptocurrencies is still minimal as of current.\nThe demand for cryptocurrencies is still increasing at a rapid rate, given that Robinhood has already added a million users onto its cryptocurrency exchange waiting list. Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the market, also added 6 million users in the past 6 months, allowing it to become the fastest growing startup in history.\nBut, the market has also experienced an exponential growth rate over the past few months. In 2017, the price of Ripple increased by 330x, Ethereum by 150x, and bitcoin by 19x. Investors within the cryptocurrency market only expect the price of cryptocurrencies to surge by large margins most of the time while dismissing the importance of corrections.\nShort-term corrections allow the market to strengthen because weak hands drop off from the market. Because of the week-long slump the market experienced over the past 7 days, many speculators have left the market and the market has stronger hands. Such a trend is evident in the decrease in the daily trading volume of most cryptocurrencies in the market.\nShort-Term Trend\nOften, the price of cryptocurrencies tend to increase after a short-term correction or slump. Although this has not been the case throughout January, it is important to consider two major factors for market recovery: tax refunds and South Korea cryptocurrency exchanges.\nIn February, US citizens and residents receive their tax refunds. This would lead to thousands of dollars in unexpected money that either would go to savings or investment. Given the adoption of cryptocurrencies, it is likely that a large portion of US tax refunds would flow into the cryptocurrency market.\nThis week, South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges open registration for new investors and traders, which may lead to a spike in volume.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

He noted that customers often bring duffel bags full of cash to pay for his services, a form of payment that poses a security challenge.\nGuest Anonymity\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have become popular in part due to their anonymity as well as their secrecy, Hof said.

A report from tech outlet DigiTimes said that Bitmain\u2019s chip orders occupy as much as 90 percent of TSMC\u2019s foundry capacity during off-peak season.\nWhile the report does not state what hardware manufacturer Samsung is working with, it is likely that it could provide this firm with the ability to scale up its operations and challenge Bitmain\u2019s dominant market share.\nLast year, Samsung used 40 old Galaxy phones to create a Bitcoin mining rig as part of an \u201cupcycling\u201d initiative intended to persuade customers to find new use cases for their old phones. The rig, of course, was more of a curiosity than an actual use case for antiquated mobile devices, but it is an interesting development given that Samsung was secretly developing ASIC chips at the time.\nNotably, Samsung is not the first major firm to make a foray into the Bitcoin mining industry. Earlier this month, Eastman Kodak announced that it had licensed its name to a mining hardware manufacturer to produce Kodak-branded miners. The scheme was roundly criticized, both for its optimistic \u2014 some said deceptive \u2014 profit predictions and the stipulation that Kodak would receive half of all coins mined by the devices.", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

Korbit, the third largest cryptocurrency exchange in the local market, has less cryptocurrencies implemented than Bithumb.\nSouth Korean cryptocurrency exchanges are extremely cautious when integrating news cryptocurrencies because they carefully analyze the demand for certain cryptocurrencies in the market. As shown in the large premiums in the local market, there exists a significant amount of demand for cryptocurrencies but less supply in the South Korean market.\nConsequently, investors purchase cryptocurrencies with rates higher than global average rates, because of the lack of supply of cryptocurrencies.\nSpecifically, prior to adding Qtum and Zcash, Bithumb was said to have done several months of risk evaluation and analysis, to ensure that the demand for the two cryptocurrencies can be sustained in the long-term.\nSouth Korean investors are not interested in all the cryptocurrencies in the market. On Bithumb for instance, on Bithumb, EOS has a larger daily trading volume than bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, and Zcash combined. Hence, for Bithumb, listing a cryptocurrency that is more popular than 7 major cryptocurrencies combined is more beneficial for the company than adding support for 7 cryptocurrencies.\nAlso, the South Korean market is restricted in the sense that foreigners are not allowed to trade fiat-to-cryptocurrencies any longer. Even before the foreigner trading ban was imposed on January 20, foreigners were limited by cryptocurrency exchanges in trading cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies.\nAs such, if a certain cryptocurrency on local exchanges have low demand but large supply, it becomes difficult for exchanges to maintain order books and continue supporting that specific cryptocurrency.\nIn other regions, miners contribute significant amounts of cryptocurrencies to exchanges, increasing the liquidity of most cryptocurrencies. In the South Korean market, the supply for almost every cryptocurrency in the global market is small because there are no large-scale mining centers. Since foreigners and overseas miners cannot bring in cryptocurrencies into the local market, the supply has to come from the local market.\nIn December, several miners from China were arrested in South Korea for selling bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies they have mined in China in the South Korea cryptocurrency market.\nIf a cryptocurrency exchnage in South Korea prematurely adds a cryptocurrency that has low supply and demand, it realistically will not be able to fill the order books for that specific cryptocurrency and potentially create serious problems for themselves and for local investors. \nUpBit\nDue to the small amount of cryptocurrencies listed by South Korean exchanges, the debut of UpBit was highly anticipated by local investors and within months, it has become the second largest cryptocurrency exchange in the market behind Bithumb.\nUpBit, operated by KakaoTalk and KakaoPay operator Kakao\u2019s subsidiary company Dunamu, has a strategic partnership with Bittrex that allows the platform to list all cryptocurrencies listed on Bittrex. To this date, UpBit remains as the only cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea with support for more than 100 cryptocurrencies.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

This will likely prove to be traumatic and disruptive. However, if federal governments and central banks have left the world economy in such a poor state that their citizens turn flee to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies en masse, one imagines that Bitcoin will not be the harbinger of trauma but rather the response to it.\nThis is why author and scholar Nassim Nicholas Taleb has said that while Bitcoin may or may not be more convenient to use than other payment systems, it is an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d against government mismanagement.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

While it often does not return the high profitability of alternative cryptocurrencies, it has a lower volatility rate than most of the cryptocurrencies in the market.\n\nThroughout 2017, both Ripple and Ethereum outperformed bitcoin in annual returns. Ripple led to a 330x return, while Ethereum recorded a 100x increase in price. Bitcoin ended the year with a 15x increase in value.\nOn January 15, a major correction hit the cryptocurrency market and the vast majority of cryptocurrencies in the market plunged in value. The valuation of all cryptocurrencies in the market declined from $700 billion to $420 billion, by more than $280 billion. \nThroughout the correction, the dominance index of bitcoin, which declined to an all-time low in early January, surged from 32 percent to 38 percent, as alternative cryptocurrency investors reallocated their funds into major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum.\nConsequently, bitcoin and Ethereum experienced a relatively small decline in value, in contrast, other cryptocurrencies in the market. \nMati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, stated:\n\u201cThe action we\u2019re seeing may seem dramatic but is really quite normal for this market. All in all, this drop has brought us back to the prices that were traded about a month ago for most cryptocurrencies.\u201d\nWas a Correction Good for the Market?\nDuring an interview with CNBC, Greenspan stated that the major correction of the market was beneficial for the global market, especially for Japan and South Korea, because it led to the decline in premiums in certain regions.\nPreviously, within the South Korean cryptocurrency market, bitcoin, Ethereum, and many other cryptocurrencies were being traded with a premium of around 30 to 40 percent. Traders within the South Korean market were paying 30 to 40 percent more to invest in cryptocurrencies.\nOne of the major concerns of the South Korean government which triggered the entire cryptocurrency trading ban fiasco was the premiums in the local market and the high prices South Korean traders have had to manage. Greenspan stated that given the premiums in Japan and South Korea declined, and the global market will likely stabilize after the correction, the recent drop in the price of virtually every single cryptocurrency in the market was a positive movement for the global market.\n\u201cThe premiums that were being paid by Japanese and South Korean crypto traders is also coming down, so that\u2019s a good sign as well, said Greenspan.\nIt is also important to acknowledge the fact that Ripple, Ethereum, and Dash along with other cryptocurrencies increased by more than 100x in 2017. Economists were calling off cryptocurrencies by describing the market as a bubble due to such returns. But, it would no longer be accurate to call the market a bubble because it suffers major corrections on a regular basis.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

But is it all bad? Or can some good come from this flash crash of January 2018?\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, only five of the top 100 coins by market cap have avoided a plunge in value over the past 24-hours. The vast majority of those falls have been in the double-digits. But the damage has not been limited to altcoins. The top eleven currencies have all similarly recorded double-digit falls.\n\nBitcoin has fallen to a six-week low, and data from CoinMarketCap recorded Bitcoin\u2019s market cap, at its lowest point, at almost half of what it was a month ago. $250 billion has been wiped off the total cryptocurrency market since Monday.\nThere are many factors that may have contributed to the bloodletting. There is continued uncertainty over the regulatory future of cryptocurrency in Korea, which represents 12% of global trading volumes.\u00a0The Chinese tightening of regulations of cryptocurrencies, ICOs, and mining present potential risks to the market\u2019s viability. Although the Chinese contribution to trading volume has fallen to 10%, it had been a significant player in the development of virtual currencies.\u00a0There are growing fears of more regulation of the industry. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has proposed a discussion \u2018on the question of Bitcoin\u2019 at the forthcoming G20 meeting in April. His German and Italian counterparts have agreed. Yesterday, the finance minister announced the formation of a task force to devise regulations for cryptocurrencies, led by a notorious bitcoin skeptic.\nExacerbating the plunge has been the spectacular rise of altcoin valuations over recent months. Those gains have led some observers to predict a dire future for many of these smaller coins that may not offer any new value already provided by the more established coins.\nThe Bright Side\nBut in the bloodbath of the current slump, can any good from of it? Consolidation periods can often be healthy ways for markets to avoid forming short-term bubbles, although it could be argued the bubble has already formed. It is also important to remember that the cryptocurrency market has seen major price corrections in the past and bounced back from them.\nA rising tide lifts all boats. A correction can provide an opportune time for investors to reassess their strategies. There is a well-known quote in investor circles that \u201cBull markets are born on pessimism, grown on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria.\u201d The euphoria of the past few months may have clouded the judgment of many cryptocurrency and ICO investors.\nThe blockchain market has become overheated and increasingly sullied by new entrants with dubious credentials, projects without significant benefits or use cases, and little underlying value. Poorly drafted whitepapers now litter the crypto-space. What better way to separate projects that are worthwhile from those that may not be than a substantial crash.\nAs recently as December, when valuations surpassed $500 billion, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin asked the question, \u201cHave we earned it?\u201d The destructive nature of the current crash may force coin developers to focus on creating value and utility for their currencies, and ultimately for the public. This would discourage a reliance on hype-fueled market speculation. This is especially true of altcoins.\nSome projects may, in fact, be creatively destroyed. But what will replace them will be better, more valuable, and more useful to a society increasingly reliant on innovative solutions to its many problems. \nFurthermore, for seasoned crypto investors, dips are opportune times to buy. For newer investors, this is the first major correction they have experienced. Some may have sold their positions in fear and be too spooked to return to the crypto-space. \nFor others, it will serve as a reminder that it is sometimes important to ignore the hype. A thorough evaluation of the fundamentals of assets, what unmet needs they serve, how they can be useful, and how credentialed the team behind them is will replace an unsophisticated pump-and-dump mentality. The crypto landscape will be healthier for the greater average wisdom among investors.\nFinally, if one of the fears driving the crash \u2013 the threat of regulation \u2013 does come to fruition, that may actually be beneficial for the cryptocurrency market. A trajectory of a more sustainable growth path and more widespread uptake among retailers, for example, could help cryptocurrencies offer measurable value. \nMore regulation might also encourage hitherto reluctant fund managers to enter the space, as well as skeptical retail investors, providing more liquidity and greater stability.\nSo while the January flash crash of 2018 is difficult for investors to enjoy, it may result in some long-term positives. \u00a0\nFor a real-time market cap chart, click here.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

A Selangor-based Proton dealership took it upon itself to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment. The problem is that automaker Proton never gave the dealership the green light, with the company saying it doesn\u2019t recognize cryptocurrencies as a payment method and as a result was suspending the dealership pending an investigation.\nMeanwhile, Proton may be cutting off its nose to spite its face. Dealership owner Tony Yeu, who is trying to bolster flagging sales, said that since he began taking bitcoin as payment, customer interest has piqued, according to reports.\n\u201cI put the banner up last Thursday night and since the next day, there was an increase in number of inquiries. Daily there are more than 10 people who will walk in, even the number of calls that we have received being interested to purchase using bitcoin has increased,\u201d said a defiant Yeu, who according to a separate report, plans to continue taking bitcoin.\nProton\u2019s position is the following:\n\u201cProton is open to innovative ways of car sales to keep customers\u2019 interest in our cars. However, we would also like to caution our sales network to exercise consideration and due care in carrying out promotion activities which are not endorsed by the company,\u201d according to a company statement.\nBitcoin Boost\nIt\u2019s not that Proton Holdings couldn\u2019t use the boost. Proton sales fell nearly 2% in 2017. The decline was due to falling taxi orders, not performance at retail spots, but nonetheless, sales fell from 72,291 vehicles to slightly less than 71,000 last year.\nThough Yeu has removed the banner promoting bitcoin as payment, he\u2019s developed a workaround to continue offering the service. Car buyers can transfer down-payments or the full-price of the vehicle, which despite the bitcoin price\u2019s recent pullback is increasingly a possibility given the quadruple-digit gains in 2017, to the dealership owner\u2019s personal digital wallet. He plans to tack on an additional 2% fee on top of the invoice price to offset the roller-coaster ride in the bitcoin price.\nTaking bitcoin is Yeu\u2019s last-ditch effort to keep the doors open at his Proton dealership, amid a goods and services tax added a few years ago that has taken a toll on sales.\nMalaysia\u2019s Bank Negara doesn\u2019t treat bitcoin or altcoins as a legal form of payment, meaning users aren\u2019t \u201ccovered\u201d in legal disputes, but a full ban doesn\u2019t appear to be in the cards, either. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchanges as per the Malaysian central bank must report activities.

According to local publication S\u00e1bado, the organization sent the Ministry of Finance, and the European commissioner in charge of consumer defense a proposal to tax cryptocurrency gains.\nAccording to the publication, DECO claims a standard 28% tax should be applied to cryptocurrency trading profits, as the same 28% tax is applied to profits earned from stocks and other financial instruments. DECO revealed the move in an edition of its \u201cProteste Investe\u201d magazine, directed at traditional investors.\nAccording to the organization, it\u2019s unfair that traditional investors have to hand over nearly one-third of their profit, while cryptocurrency investors don\u2019t have to pay anything. Its piece reads (roughly translated):\n\u201cWhat is the argument for not taxing this type of financial operation? A small saver who lends his savings to the state (via savings certificates) or who invests in a company\u2019s shares and creates wealth and employment sees the government keep almost one-third of the profit (income and capital gains are usually taxed at 28%). How can we justify this fiscal inequality? It is difficult. \u201c\nAndr\u00e9 Gouveia, an economist at DECO, restated that every other type of investment is subject to a 28% tax, and as such it\u2019s unfair cryptocurrencies remain exempt.\nAs previously covered by CCN, Portugal is a country in which the government wants to tax bitcoin users, despite a lack of regulations. The Ministry of Finance has made it clear bitcoin has no legal framework in the country, and yet it claims cryptocurrency earnings are taxable if earned as a result of a professional activity.\nAccording to S\u00e1bado, the government is currently keeping potential bitcoin regulations in the hands of the European Union (EU). The government seemingly lets financial regulators, such as the country\u2019s central bank, handle any cryptocurrency-related issues, along with the EU.\nWhen asked, PS [pollical party] Parliamentary Group vice-president and party spokesman Jo\u00e3o Galamba said \u201cbitcoin should be regulated at the European and G20 level,\u201d adding that it would be counterproductive for the country to create \u201cisolated initiatives.\u201d\nS\u00e1bado also spoke to left and right-wing parties.

Based on electronic commerce law, the government does not have the authority to close down cryptocurrency trading platforms.\u201d\nThe official was offering his take on the recent controversial statements by the country\u2019s justice minister Park Sang-ki. In a press briefing a week ago, the latter revealed the ministry was \u201cpreparing legislation that basically bans any transactions based on a virtual currency through trading.\u201d In essence, a complete shutdown of domestic cryptocurrency exchanges \u201cwould be one of the goals we are aiming for,\u201d justice minister Park said. The backlash from the Korean public was immediate and fierce, compelling the official office of the Korean president to release a statement cooling fears of a ban on trading, on the same day of the justice minister\u2019s statement.\nThe statement is particularly notable, coming from the chairman of the country\u2019s economic competition regular and a member of South Korea\u2019s cryptocurrency task force \u2013 an inter-governmental collective tasked to propose a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry. The FTC joins the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, a fellow task-force member, in refusing to support the proposed ban by the Ministry of Justice.\nAsked if the increased investments into cryptocurrencies is due to excessive speculation, chairman Kim expressed a hands-off approach, pitting cryptocurrencies alongside any other traditional investment. He stated:\n\u201cFrom the viewpoint of an economist, it is not a fair and transparent decision to outright ban economic activity. Whether it is excessive speculation or not, the gain or the loss is the responsibility of the investor.\u201d\nFurthermore, Kim called or a more nuanced regulatory approach with limits for investors. A ban, if needed, would extend only to crypto exchanges and trading platforms violating rules.\nHe said:\n\u201cThe government is investigating into cryptocurrency exchanges to examine whether trading platforms have violated their own terms and conditions by establishing a limit on withdrawals of individual investors.\u201d\nWith additional reporting from Joseph Young.", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

After peaking near $4 earlier this month, the ripple price plunged as low as $0.88 on Bittrex on Wednesday, representing a 77 percent peak-to-valley decline.\nThursday, however, demonstrated that the markets do not intend to go down without a fight, and cryptocurrencies rose across the board as $177 billion in capital flowed back into the ecosystem. The ripple price was one of the day\u2019s top performers, rising 49 percent, which enabled XRP to outperform the cryptocurrency market cap index and recover to $1.56. Ripple now has a circulating market cap of $61.1 billion, which makes it roughly twice as valuable as bitcoin cash.\nXRP Price Chart\nSouth Korea now accounts for 67 percent of all XRP trading, which may be a new all-time high. A plurality of that volume is concentrated on Bithumb, but Upbit has emerged as a major force within the market and currently ranks as the world\u2019s largest exchange with a 24-hour volume in excess of $8.3 billion. These exchanges currently price XRP as high as $1.87, which represents a 20 percent premium over the token\u2019s equivalent value on Western exchanges.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nFactors Behind the Ripple Price Rally\nThe primary driver of this rally is the market\u2019s general upswing, but several factors enabled XRP to outperform other top cryptocurrencies.\nMost importantly, yet another South Korean regulatory agency has spoken out publicly against the Justice Ministry\u2019s proposed cryptocurrency exchange ban. The chairman of the country\u2019s Fair Trade Commission said yesterday that he believes a blanket ban is \u201cnot realistically possible\u201d and that the government does not have the authority to make such a policy change. Given the heavy concentration of XRP trading in Korea, this announcement understandably had an outsized effect on the ripple price.\nAdditionally, South Korean bank Woori Bank announced that it would conduct a second pilot program using Ripple\u2019s enterprise blockchain. Although the trial will not include the use of XRP, these trials nevertheless seem to have a positive effect on the ripple price.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

United States as Jan. 23\u2019s \u201cpetition of the day.\u201d This designation indicates that Goldstein, a former litigator who also taught Supreme Court litigation at Harvard Law School, believes that the case covers legal matters that have a \u201creasonable chance\u201d of being granted a hearing by the Court if presented in the right vehicle.\nUlbricht, who operated the infamous darknet marketplace Silk Road under the pseudonym \u201cDread Pirate Roberts,\u201d is currently serving life in prison without parole for a variety of crimes related to his operation of the Silk Road, including money laundering and drug trafficking.\nThe sentence was unexpectedly harsh \u2014 the trial judge stated that it was meant to send a message to other darknet marketplace operators \u2014 and Ulbricht\u2019s advocates maintain that the investigation and trial were \u201crife with corruption, abuse, and violations.\u201d Nevertheless, a Second Circuit appellate court rejected Ulbricht\u2019s appeal last year.\nUlbricht has now petitioned (PDF)\u00a0to have his case taken up by the Supreme Court, arguing that his Fourth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated during the investigation and sentencing.\nSpecifically, the petition maintains that government agents violated Ulbricht\u2019s Fourth Amendment right by collecting his internet traffic information without a warrant or probable cause.\nAdditionally, the petition alleges that the judge violated his Sixth Amendment rights by basing Ulbricht\u2019s \u201cotherwise unreasonable sentence\u201d partly on allegations that he had attempted to pay a hitman to commit five murders. These murders were never carried out, and the government did not charge Ulbricht with attempting to commission them. Consequently, Ulbricht\u2019s petition argues that these uncharged, unproven allegations should not have been allowed to factor into his sentencing.\nBy naming Ulbricht v.

Ripple in particular demonstrated a staggering 48 percent increase in value, while bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, and Litecoin have risen in the range of 15 percent to 35 percent.\nAlthough major cryptocurrencies are still down significantly from their all-time highs, bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Ripple have all kept their \u201cpsychological thresholds.\u201d Bitcoin has rebounded above the $10,000 mark, Ether recovered past $1,000, and Ripple did not decline below the $1 mark.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) from the South Korean and Chinese cryptocurrency markets caused the recent correction, given its magnitude and the size of both markets. But, a reasonable explanation is the closure of bitcoin future contracts on January 17, and whales or institutional investors in the traditional finance market dumping cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to cash out their short contracts.\nOver the past 12 months, Ripple has surged by 330-fold, Ether by 130-fold, and bitcoin by 19-fold, with minor corrections. It is also possible that the sudden increase of cryptocurrencies without a major drop in value led to a large correction to occur.\nPreviously, Ethereum creators Vitalik Buterin and Charles Hoskinson questioned the value of most cryptocurrencies in the market, given that tokens without products and users have obtained multi-billion dollar valuations within a short period of time. \nWith the recent correction in mind, public blockchains and cryptocurrencies within the global market will need to prove their potential and justify their market valuations by obtaining actual active user bases and useful products. Otherwise, even in a bull market like the cryptocurrency market, another major correction is inevitable.\nWhere Does Bitcoin and Ethereum Go Next?\nIn late 2017, billionaire investor Mike Novogratz predicted the price of bitcoin to achieve the $40,000 mark and Ether to surpass $1,500. If the cryptocurrency market can recover to its previous levels before January 16, when bitcoin and Ethereum were at $14,000 and $1,300 respectively, the cryptocurrency market would be in a better position to initiate stronger rallies without weak hands and speculators. \nEarlier this week, during an interview with QZ, Constantin Papadimitriou, president of Pundi X, stated that the adoption of bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies is rapidly increasing in India despite the government\u2019s crackdown on the market. Consequently, the government has started to reconsider its policies and possibly regulate its cryptocurrency market, although no regulations have been finalized as of yet.\nIncreasing adoption of cryptocurrencies by large remittance markets like India and the Philippines will allow the global cryptocurrency market and blockchains within it to increase further in value. Major financial institutions such as Japan\u2019s largest bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, better known as UFG, and South Korea\u2019s second largest commercial bank Shinhan Bank have also started the development of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet platforms.", "category": "Altcoin Prices"}

More than 55,000 registered for the public token sale, the first to be built on and supported by Stellar, as opposed to Ethereum. The sale was originally scheduled to run through Feb. 18.\nThe token sale hit $39 million, according to crowdfundinsiser.com, and could be the largest ICO of 2018.\nThe MOBI token allows companies and consumers to exchange data by smart contracts and plug into the blockchain ecosystem.\nIndividual buyers were limited to a maximum of 25,000 tokens each in order to ensure as many people could participate as possible in the sale. Only Stellar Lumens (XLM) was accepted as payment.\nICO Follows Record Pre-Sale\nThe MOBI pre-sale was the largest of Q4 2017 and of 2018, with more than $35 million in sales, and was oversubscribed by an additional $10 million.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to continue to help push the blockchain community into safer, faster, and more secure protocols,\u201d said David Gobaud, CEO and co-founder of Mobius. \u201cOur patent-pending technology will have broad implications for businesses being able to operate more efficiently and with greater capability in the blockchain ecosystem. Our successful offering is further validation of our token\u2019s real-world utility.\u201d\nMobius secured an additional $1.9 million in investments via the Y Combinator SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity). Participants included Angel Chain Capital, based in Beijing, and Waltonchain, a blockchain ecosystem. These investors participated in both the token sale and SAFE investment round. Waltonchain also has a Top 50 token listed, the Walton Coin (WTC).\n\u201cMobius\u2019 blockchain software is the perfect synergy to Waltonchain\u2019s hardware expertise in building next-generation smart devices,\u201d said Dr. Mo Bing, CEO of Waltonchain. \u201cWe believe the team and company have a bright future and can help us lead the hardware revolution \u2014 creating scalable blockchain solutions and integrating secure smart contracting capabilities on our next generation hardware devices. We look forward to building exciting things together.\u201d\nBridging Blockchain And Internet\nThe core premise of Mobius is to bridge the gap between the Internet and blockchain, which will facilitate the mainstream adoption of the blockchain.\nMobius closes the gap between the two through a multifaceted solution creating easy developer tools, a consumer DApp Store, and a \u201cSmart Market\u201d to allow efficient transactions of processed real-world data between autonomous agents.\nThe individual segments of the project can themselves be different blockchain based companies.\nPrimitive developer tools and protocols are the first problem identified by Mobius towards the mainstream adoption of the blockchain. Current blockchain developer APIs and frameworks are very hard to use. Mobius plans to convert millions of traditional app developers into blockchain developers through simple and standardized protocols.\nThe Mobius dApp store will facilitate easy discovery and adoption of distributed applications. The Mobius tokens will be the default payment option on the dApp store, however, by using Mobius APIs, developers can accept payments in other cryptocurrencies.\nA comparable example would be Stripe, which enables a vendor to accept payments from different networks like Visa, Mastercard via a single interface. This will provide a broad audience base to the dApp developers. Projects facilitating inter-blockchain communication are based on a similar premise.\nAlso read: ICO analysis: Mobius\nSmart Market Protocol\nThe final aspect of the Mobius Network is the creation of smart market protocol which will facilitate buying and selling of services and data between multiple parties in an auction like system. One of the use cases of the smart market protocol is automated bidding and selling data feeds coming in from IoT devices via smart contracts.\nMobius is based on the Stellar platform. Stellar can support around 1,000 transactions per second, along with microtransactions. The MOBI tokens will be used for transactions within the platform, although developers can also receive payments in their own tokens. Network effects will incentivize developers to use MOBI tokens. To promote the platform, users and developers will be rewarded with MOBI in the initial stages of use.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

Nevertheless, he noted (roughly translated) that \u201cthe market that to me most looks like a bubble is that of bitcoin and its sisters.\u201d\nThe economist further added that the cryptocurrency ecosystem is acting irrationally. As an example, he pointed to Long Island Iced Tea\u2019s shares surging over 300% following a blockchain rebrand to Long Blockchain Corp. \u201cCompanies are adding \u2018blockchain\u2019 to their name and their value goes up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense that it keeps going like this.\u201d\nThrough social media, Thaler had already ironically addressed the Long Island Iced Tea case.

Thus far, the tone from Nordic central banks on bitcoin has been ominous, with policymakers warning that cryptocurrencies are riddled with danger and speculation as regulators try and protect investors against the bout of volatility that\u2019s unfolded in the top cryptocurrencies of late.\nTaking a Page Out of JPMorgan\u2019s Book?\nNordea isn\u2019t the first bank to warn its employees to stay away from bitcoin.

Out of the 100 million Petros Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ordered, about 38 million will go to institutional investors, in a month-long presale set to begin on February 15. Only institutional investors will participate in the presale, and will reportedly be able to buy the cryptocurrency at a discount of up to 60 percent.\nAccording to Reuters, Venezuela has now revealed that it will accept cryptocurrencies and hard currencies during the presale. The country\u2019s fiat currency, the bolivar, will notably not be accepted. Carlos Vargas, the government\u2019s cryptocurrency superintendent, bullishly appointed by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to \u201cgovern\u201d the Petro and its transactions, stated:\n\u201cThe presale and initial offer will be made in hard currencies and in cryptocurrencies. It is not going to be done in bolivars at this stage (\u2026) Our responsibility is to put (the petro) in the best hands and then a secondary market will appear.\u201d\nFollowing the 38 million token presale to institutional investors, an additional 44 million Petros will be sold to the general public. Vargas added that, after the presale, the Petro could then be exchanged for the country\u2019s local currency, which went down against the dollar over 3,400 percent last year.\nThis somewhat counters the information contained in a whitepaper, allegedly leaked from the government\u2019s official website. The whitepaper claimed only those with access to the bolivar could purchase the Petro, and that the cryptocurrency\u2019s blockchain would be public. The Venezuelan government denounced the whitepaper contained false information , as the real one will \u201csoon\u201d be made public.\nAs reported, the Petro is an oil-backed cryptocurrency announced late last year. Although the Petro token is set to be backed by the country\u2019s oil reserves, holders won\u2019t be able to exchange coins for the actual oil. The oil-backed cryptocurrency has been labeled a way to circumvent U.S. sanctions, and the U.S. Treasury recently warned Americans that investing in it could mean they\u2019re violating the sanctions.\nThe opposition-run Venezuelan congress has outlawed Maduro\u2019s Petro, as an \u201cillegal and unconstitutional\u201d instrument. The cryptocurrency is seen as an effort to \u201cillegally mortgage\u201d the country\u2019s oil reserves.\nVenezuela Eases Stance on Cryptocurrency Mining\nNotably, Carlos Vargas also said that those mining other cryptocurrencies in Venezuela aren\u2019t doing anything illegal. According to him, the activity is \u201cnow perfectly legal.\u201d He revealed:\n\u201cWe have had meetings with the Supreme Court so that people who have been victims of seizures and arrests in previous years will have charges dismissed.\u201d\nMany in the country have used cryptocurrencies to survive government failures, as covered by CCN. Last year, the government issued a crackdown on cryptocurrencies that, among other occurrences, saw miners being arrested by authorities, and a bitcoin mining center being destroyed.\nAt one point, the country\u2019s state-owned internet service provider, CANTV, blocked bitcoin-related websites and mining pools. Moreover, the country\u2019s biggest exchange, SurBitcoin, had to temporarily shut down operations, as Banesco bank closed its account.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

It is said to be the first building in Japan to be sold using bitcoin.\nBitcoin For Large Transactions\nDuring an interview with South Korean mainstream media outlet MK, a Japanese real estate startup Yitanzi stated that it is selling various properties including a small commercial building and apartment spaces for cryptocurrencies. The startup\u2019s CTO Yokozawa Yuske stated that an increasing number of investors in the local cryptocurrency space have started to\u00a0eye the country\u2019s real estate market, primarily to spend profits they have amassed from cryptocurrency investment over the past few years.\nYuske noted that there are also many investors in the local real estate market looking to sell multi-million dollar properties in exchange for bitcoin, because it is difficult to purchase massive amounts of bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges without undergoing a rigorous verification process to increase trading limits. \nAlready, Yitanzi spokesperson revealed that a property in Tokyo will be sold for bitcoin in the upcoming weeks and that other properties listed by the startup will also be sold for bitcoin. The company did not comment on integrating or accepting other cryptocurrencies in the market but as for now, it will only accept bitcoin for property purchases.\nNormally, purchasing properties through banks and third party service providers lead to significantly high fees, especially if several millions of dollars have to be transacted between two seperate banks. As such, to circumvent the inefficient global banking system, many realtors in London and UAE have started to accept bitcoin for large-scale payments as well.\nIn September 2017, British entrepreneurs Michelle Mone and Doug Barrowman disclosed that their $356 million real estate project will accept bitcoin from clients and buyers. Each apartment in the complex costs 30 bitcoins, around $330,000.\nAt the time, Barrowman stated:\n\u201cI\u2019ve been invested in the crypto world for the last couple of years really, and it\u2019s a sector I\u2019ve watched grow and emerge. So I see it coming to that stage where the early adopters are giving way to a more mainstream application of cryptocurrency, and therefore it\u2019s a logical extension to take land and buildings and effectively offer people the opportunity to pay in cryptocurrency or bitcoin rather than just fiat currency.\u201d\nWhile bitcoin fees could be costly for small payments especially when the network congests and fees spike up to over $10, for transactions above $100,000, a $10 transaction fee is substantially lower than bank wiring fees.\nIncreasing Adoption\nIn Japan, some of the largest electronics manufacturers, budget hotel chains, airlines, and retailers have already started to accept bitcoin as a payment method since early 2017, almost immediately after the Japanese government legalized bitcoin and regulated its cryptocurrency exchange market.\nBic Camera, the country\u2019s biggest electronics retailer, and Peach, Japan\u2019s most widely used budget airline, have been accepting bitcoin payments for more than six months. The integration of bitcoin by influential conglomerates have increased the awareness of the Japanese people regarding cryptocurrencies, leading to a surge in interest and demand for bitcoin.\nThis month, Japan\u2019s largest bank MUFG announced its plans to launch a cryptocurrency exchange to address growing demand from institutional and retail traders.", "category": "Accepts Bitcoin"}

President Rachel Bronson and fellow members Lawrence M. Krauss and Robert Rosner listed the looming threat of nuclear war between the United States and North Korea as well as global warming as two key reasons for the decision.\nWhat is the Doomsday Clock you ask? It\u2019s a symbolic giant clock that scientists at the Bulletin first brought to the world in 1947 as a means of providing a visual representation of how close the world was to a global nuclear catastrophe.\nThe clock is now set at two minutes to midnight, the closest it has been since 1953, the year of the Cold War.\nSitting back and considering what would happen to us all should a catastrophic event cause the world to take a turn for the worse, I can only help but wonder how and why such a scenario would accelerate the adoption of decentralized cryptocurrencies.\nDigital Gold\nDaniel Marburger is the director of precious metals at Coinvest. He says his firm is currently taking a high volume of calls from Bitcoin investors who are losing value as crypto markets continue to slide. They want to know how to hedge their bets and turn their coins into gold.\nHistory shows that Bitcoin goes up in value whenever gold is plummeting, and the reverse is true when Bitcoin drops.\nA logical person might assume that the value of gold would go up should anything bad happen. After all, people have been using gold to hedge their bets against financial crises for a long time. The economic collapse of 2008 is a great example of how the price of gold managed to recover its value in one year and safeguard people\u2019s savings.\nEven though I just told you that the price of Bitcoin historically decreases when gold\u2019s value rises, the truth is that in a doomsday scenario the value of both would probably rise.\nOne in three Millennials will own cryptocurrency by the end of 2018, according to a recent study conducted by London Block Exchange. The fact is this group is represented by people born in the mid-80s and onward, myself being one of them.\nThere are enough of us 20 and 30-somethings out there to give rise to cryptocurrency during a global catastrophe, but there are also still enough people out there from generations gone by that know nothing about crypto that would immediately put their money into gold. Hence the reason both stores of wealth would rise in value.\nUtility\nGold is the old school and cryptocurrency is the new school, but which one has greater utility?\nWhile pondering this question, consider the possibility that a global catastrophe would likely impact the flow of paper money in and out of central banks, and the paper itself would probably plummet in value and cease to have any meaning at all.\nPeople might then turn to gold because it\u2019s a real physical asset, but how much gold would there be to go around? And how would we all divide it in exchange for essential goods and services? After all, certificates wouldn\u2019t mean much in a public marketplace where everybody wants to buy the basic necessities required for living.\nThis is why the technologically well-versed would almost certainly turn to cryptocurrency, especially considering crypto vernacular has made so much headway in mass media over the last year. It\u2019s been mentioned on major American television shows like The Big Bang Theory and Saturday Night Live.\nIt\u2019s not like people can claim they don\u2019t know about it anymore. Millenials and those that know more about smart devices than they do about gold bullion would therefore almost certainly opt for a digital wallet over a heavy, cumbersome gold bar.\nScaling\nGold is a scarce resource. 165,000 metric tons of it have been mined throughout human history. The world\u2019s population currently sits at an estimated 7.55 billion people.\nKeeping in mind that gold can be used for many other things besides trade, it means that not everyone would get the exact 0.0000022 tons of gold they would be entitled to if every single person on the planet got an equal share of the 165,000 metric tons available.\nThis means that in terms of scaling to serve everybody on the planet, gold and other material resources like silver or oil wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a practical way of communicating value on a day-to-day basis.\nThe problem is that the cryptocurrency community has also struggled to find ways to scale and serve the masses. Several of the industry\u2019s top exchanges have had to stop accepting new registrations at one point or another.\nEven blockchain platforms themselves like Bitcoin competitor Ethereum, (the world\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization), has struggled to handle transactions because of something as trivial as people\u2019s obsession with digital kittens.\nIdeas and Technology Trump All\nGiven the scaling issues of both scarce resources and blockchains, neither one is ideal, but my last point here is where cryptocurrency adoption takes the cake.\nNothing is more powerful than an idea. In a world where the average 12-year-old spends 8 to 10 hours a day in front of a digital screen, both Millenials and the next generation are going to be more inclined to invest their time in creating ideas that fall in line with the advancement of technology.\nNew ideas surrounding blockchains, technology, and artificial intelligence will inevitably take humans to new frontiers never seen before, including concepts like decentralized currency, self-driving cars and the eventual fruition of singularity, the idea that artificial intelligence will eventually reach a tipping point where it becomes smarter than human beings.\nSo while gold and other scarce resources certainly have value because we need them to survive a major catastrophe, cryptocurrencies are really just an extension of new ideas being created using the basic principles of decentralization and computer coding.\nThis is why a nuclear bomb, a major shift in global warming or any other worldwide disaster would proliferate the adoption of cryptocurrencies at a faster rate than anyone can measure.\nThe question is, can\u2019t we all just get along and let mass adoption happen on its own?\nAll we can do is hope.", "category": "News"}

Prior to the ETFs being unveiled, regulators asked that the issuers, Amplify Investments and Reality Shares Inc., make their debut sans blockchain in their names, despite the fact that both ETFs have exposure to blockchain-driven companies.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t an order, reports suggest, but the companies complied anyway, perhaps in fear of regulators scrapping the funds altogether.\nInvestors can still detect a hint of blockchain in the symbols, evidenced by the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) and Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN).\u00a0If things had gone the way the companies intended, investors would be choosing between the\u00a0Amplify Blockchain Leaders ETF and the Reality Shares Nasdaq Blockchain Economy ETF instead of the more generic names the issuers went with.\nWhile the SEC has thus far pushed backed against any bitcoin ETF listings, including the version offered by the Winklevoss twins last year, blocking blockchain takes it a step further. As reports suggest, the move is likely an attempt to prevent a frenzy in the NAV of the funds similar to the response listed companies, such as Long Blockchain\u2019s 200%+ advance, have triggered.\nNonetheless, blockchain \u2014 the underpinning technology for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies \u2014 is precisely what investors are going to get with these funds, and regulators may be doing investors more of a disservice by favoring a disguise. It\u2019s not as though both companies don\u2019t outline the possible risks associated with blockchain in their SEC filings \u2014 both companies in their November 2017 SEC filings do. By hiding their blockchain association, regulators are either delaying the inevitable or are in denial.\nMeanwhile, so far in 2018, the SEC crushed the plans of a dozen cryptocurrencies ETFs as well as a pair of mutual funds, according to reports. Regulators pointed to the risks associated with combining the popular ETF structure with digital coins as well as\u00a0volatility inherent in cryptocurrency prices as a hurdle to valuing funds.\nBLOK and BLCN ETFs\nBLOK only just started trading but it has an NAV of $20. The ETF,\u00a0according to the fund description, is comprised of \u201cglobal companies at the forefront of blockchain-based technology.\u201d The fund is actively managed, rather than tracking an underlying index, and contains securities including Taiwain Semi, Digital Garage, Nvidia, Square, IBM and others.\nIndex-tracking BLCN, meanwhile, is bullish on distributed ledger tech and is invested in dozen of \u201cblockchain-related companies,\u201d including the likes of Overstock.com, chipmaker Intel, China\u2019s Hive BlckChn Tech, among others. The index that BCLN tracks has generated returns of 5% year-to-date, according to Bloomberg.\nThe fees tied to the blockchain ETFs are 70 bps and 68 bps for Amplify and Reality, respectively, with the higher fee for Amplify reflecting the actively managed status.\nMeanwhile, the Fort Worth office of the SEC appears engaged with the blockchain, having tweeted in recent days: \u201cWe\u2019re contemplating adding \u201cBlockchain\u201d to our name so we\u2019ll increase our followers by 70,000 percent.\u201d", "category": "Blockchain News"}

The class action complaint was filed yesterday with the Southern District Court of Florida by cryptocurrency fraud specialist\u00a0Silver Miller Law, the attorneys representing the plaintiffs.\nAll BitConnect investors who suffered losses resulting from the company\u2019s activities and platform closure are entitled to join the lawsuit as Class Members. The complaint lists BitConnect\u2019s three corporate entities in the UK and fourteen individuals, including ten of unknown names, as defendants. The individuals include California-based Glenn Arcaro, the director of BitConnect International PLC, and prominent affiliates and recruiters promoting BitConnect on social media platforms such as Youtube and Facebook.\nThe complaint lists twelve counts of criminal and civil violations BitConnect is alleged to have engaged in. These include a number of state and federal securities violations in relation to fraud and offering unregistered securities, the rescission of a contractual arrangement between BitConnect and the plaintiffs, deceptive and unfair trade practices, fraudulent inducement, fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation, conversion (exerting unauthorized use or control of someone else\u2019s property), and civil conspiracy.\nBitConnect, widely suspected in the crypto-space of being little more than a Ponzi scheme, allowed investors to lend money to BitConnect, which the company would then use to trade in the volatile cryptocurrency market using advanced trading software. It promised investors 40% returns per month and 1% returns per day, regardless of market conditions.\n\nBitConnect loans had to be converted from fiat or bitcoin into the platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency, BCC. Naturally, as investor demand for BCC grew, so did the value of the currency, reaching highs of around $430 with a market cap above $2.6B. When the platform was shuttered on January 16th, its tokens became practically worthless, exposing investors to substantial losses.\nBitConnect\u2019s dubious reputation in the industry mirrored its short and incident-plagued history. The company launched through an ICO in 2016-2017. On 5th January 2018, the Securities Commissioner of Texas filed a cease and desist order against the company, accusing it of fraud and selling unregistered securities. North Carolina followed soon after.\nBitConnect shut its exchange on January 17th, citing DDoS attacks, regulatory challenges and bad press. Its token plummeted by 90% with the closure of its platform. It promised to continue support for its proprietary currency. However, as the class action suit contends, by shutting its trading and exchange platform, its native currency fell by 90% and the promise of continued support for BCC was \u2018hollow; as the only true value the token held was on BITCONNECT\u2019s own platform\u2019.\nAt the time of writing, BitConnect was proceeding with its planned BitConnect X ICO to launch a new coin, BCCX.

Finman argues that Bitcoin is just as real as fiat money, he believes that the cryptocurrency and its underlying technology offers young people the opportunity to leapfrog the older generation and compete in terms of wealth and what it offers.\n\u201cCryptocurrency represents the largest transfer of wealth our generation has ever seen. Never before have young people been able to change economic classes so quickly\u201d, says Finman.\nThe words of Finman clearly explains the situation in most parts of Africa, a continent where majority of the political and industrial leaders are well past the age of youth. Compared to their counterparts in other parts of the world, African youths have been left out of traditional developmental systems. Same applies to wealth opportunities \u2013 while there exists a few wealthy older citizens, majority of the youths barely live on handouts.\nAfrican Youth Are Taking Chances\nAs Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency becomes more popular on a global level, young Africans are seizing the opportunities within the ecosystem to close the gap between them and the older generation. The faces that are behind the blockchain technologies indigenous to the African continent represent a generation that is ready for a change.\nLike Finman who tells Forbes that his knack for politics is actually what got him interested in bitcoin initially. Young Africans seem to have adopted the Bitcoin ecosystem as a path towards relevance as well. As a matter of fact the gap between the generation of the existing leaders and the younger ones can only be closed up by a major disruption, and Bitcoin and blockchain is presenting this opportunity.\nA country like Nigeria that faced its worst ever recession in decades had the populace looking for alternatives for transaction, and Bitcoin/altcoins was a suitable option. This led to an exponential growth in the awareness level and adoption of cryptocurrencies. The situation also hastened the settling down of a number of exchanges such as Bitpesa, Luno and Remitano in the West African country.\nAchieving Leadership through Blockchain\nOther indigenous projects that focus on the peculiar problems of financial inclusion and remittances such as Kora network, Surebanqa and Abjcoin are all championed by the next generation of industrialists. These projects focus on empowering the hitherto sidelined population, creating room for access to mostly financial services and empowering the locals who have been subjected to protracted deprivation.\nApparently, Finman\u2019s assertion is finding fulfillment in so many ways. Added to his original and traditional \u201cbuy and hold\u201d investment system that has been adopted by several young investors, Blockchain innovations and participation affords the younger generation a place in leadership.\nOn his Twitter, Finman writes:\n\u201cDeep down, everybody knows cryptocurrencies are the future. Even the bankers and Wall Street know it. The only debate is how long until it completely takes over.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Progress"}

Basic measures including access control device installation and operation, storage of user passwords, and protection of users were integrated poorly.\u201d\nCoinone and Yapian received a combined penalty of over $50,000 for failing to store account passwords and sensitive user information securely. The KCSC emphasized that the two cryptocurrency exchanges did not segregate user accounts that were inactive for more than a year.\nKorbit, the third largest exchange in the South Korean market, was fined $20,000 for lacking security breach detection tools and a server intrusion prevention system. Upbit, the most popular cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea that is operated by Dunamu, a subsidiary of KakaoTalk operator Kakao, was fined $20,000 for being in violation of Privacy Act.\nLow Penalties, Optimistic\nA KCSC spokesperson told Yonhap stated that the penalties received by local cryptocurrency exchanges are \u201cfar too small,\u201d and the KCSC is aware of it. But, given that the exchanges were found in violation of Privacy Act and other policies for the first time since their launch, the agency imposed a smaller fine. \nThe imposition of fines against cryptocurrency exchanges for poor security measures is optimistic for the South Korean cryptocurrency market in the long run, because it has shown that the government has taken the approach of regulating the market and protecting investors, rather than issuing an outright ban on cryptocurrency trading. \nThe KCSC provided the eight exchanges a 30-day deadline to implement necessary security measures and systems to prevent the theft of user information, account data, and funds. Lee Hyo-sung, the chairman of KCSC, said in a press conference that the agency will ensure South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges will operate with better security measures to protect investors and traders.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

However, some seem to think that IOTA\u2019s future is uncertain.\nEarlier today cryptocurrency hedge fund Multicoin Capital, based in Austin, Texas released their analysis of IOTA. While the analysis was primarily in regards to the value of the currency, it also explored what Multicoin Capital sees as the currency\u2019s major flaws.\nAt the time of this writing, the IOTA price is $2.51. In December of 2017, the price was over $5. Since the Multicoin Capital analysis was released today, they believe that IOTA is overvalued in the $2.50 range which is approximately half of what it was just a month ago.\nWhy do they believe it\u2019s overvalued? The answer is actually quite simple. While IOTA has plenty of potential in the internet of things, at this point IOTA is not being utilized on a large scale for any singular purpose other than investing. The creators of IOTA didn\u2019t intend for it to simply be a store of value, the technology behind it is all about function and the world hasn\u2019t really found a place for IOTA yet.\nCited Concerns\nThe analysts at Multicoin Capital examined IOTA thoroughly. While they offered criticism, they also praised the developers for things such as the currency\u2019s DAG base, the lack of fees, and IOTA\u2019s scalability.\nOne of their primary concerns is the fact that the IOTA Coordinator is centralized. While the currency itself is decentralized, the Coordinator that keeps it safe from attacks is not. The actual level of safety provided by the Coordinator has not been verified by an outside party due to the fact that it\u2019s closed source.\nAnother concern voiced by Multicoin Capital ties to the current lack of utilization faced by IOTA. As mentioned, the world hasn\u2019t found a specific place for IOTA yet. One of the reasons for this is that present IOT devices require hardware upgrades to use the IOTA network. Their analysts see this as one of the most significant problems for the future of IOTA.\nWhile other concerns were expressed by Multicoin Capital in addition to those covered here, the final factor against IOTA that will be discussed in this article is its software problems. These issues were discovered at the MIT Media Lab.\nTo sum up the software problems simply, IOTA was developed with vulnerabilities. The development team knew about them but the public was not aware until the discovery at the MIT Media Lab. Even after the software vulnerabilities were discovered, it took months to get an official statement from the IOTA team on the issue.\nThe analysts at Multicoin Capital have strong opinions about IOTA. While they are concerned about the future of this cryptocurrency, they also want to see it reach its potential. Like many others, they want to see solutions to a few problems before they dive in.\nIOTA did not respond to CCN\u2019s request for a comment up to press time.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

As the $10,000 mark was a psychological threshold for bitcoin investors, the $1 mark of Ripple is also an important threshold that led the price of Ripple to increase by 33-fold within several weeks. If the price of Ripple or XRP cannot sustain itself above $1, the market valuation of Ripple could potentially decline further.\n\nHowever, given Ripple\u2019s massive following in the South Korean market and the large daily trading volumes of XRP on UpBit and Bithumb, two of the country\u2019s largest cryptocurrency trading platforms, it is highly unlikely that the market valuation of Ripple would fall below $40 billion. As of current, the market cap of Ripple is less than half of Ethereum\u2019s. It is not likely that the market cap of Ripple would fall below the current levels unless an unexpected event occurs in the short-term.\nBitcoin has also struggled to maintain the gains it recorded on January 25, as it demonstrated a 5 percent decline in price, from $11,300 to $10,800. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency Ether along with EOS recorded the lowest losses out of the major cryptocurrencies, demonstrating a slight 2 percent decline in market valuation.\n\nNEM however, the tenth most valuable cryptocurrency in the market, experienced a staggering 16 percent decline in its price. The abrupt plunge in the value of NEM was said to be triggered by a potential security breach which occured on CoinCheck, a leading Japanese cryptocurrency exchange. \nOn January 26, reports were released by local Japanese media that CoinCheck has disabled all Japanese yen withdrawal and cash outs due to suspicious transactions. Unverified reports claimed that $500 million worth of NEM were withdrawn from CoinCheck and whether it was a group of users or a hacker that stole NEM from the exchange remains unclear. \nThe cryptocurrency community is anxiously anticipating an official statement from CoinCheck but as of now, it has not been confirmed that the exchange was hacked. \nA sudden flow of $500 million from a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange could have triggered the market to fall as well.

Former UBS banker Jan Brzezek has launched a new cryptocurrency fund and is\u00a0targeting $10 million by month\u2019s end, as per Bloomberg. The crypto fund is currently domiciled offshore and is passive in nature (though an active product is planned for the summer), tracking the performance of the maiden blue-chip index for cryptocurrencies, said Brzezek. He is seeking approval from Swiss regulators to broaden the reach of the fund to more clients.\nBrzezek\u2019s move from traditional banking to cryptocurrencies is indicative of a notable trend of similar moves, one that extends to a former BlackRock pair that decamped from the world\u2019s largest asset management firm to run a crypto hedge fund.\nMeanwhile, a trio of former Goldman Sachs employees unveiled an ETF-like cryptocurrency fund targeting wealthy investors on Jan. 1. Crescent Crypto Asset Management\u2019s debut fund gains exposure to nearly two-dozen cryptocurrencies, giving investors greater diversification than Brzezek\u2019s fund. One of the three former Goldman alums, Ali Hassan, entered bitcoin at $300 with the funds from a bonus given to him by his former employer, as per the FT.\nFor his part, Brzezek has attracted the likes of Raymond J. Baer, honorary chairman of the Julius Baer Gruppe AG, and Susi Partners AG, Zurich\u2019s chief Tobias Reichmuth to the board.\nThe banker shift to crypto adds insult to injury for a traditional banking sector that has been caught in the middle of the rise of bitcoin and other altcoins despite the best efforts of some to suppress the movement.\nCrytoFinance AG\nBrzezek\u2019s LinkedIn profile says he\u2019s CEO and co-founder of\u00a0 Switzerland-based CryptoFinance AG, with the tagline, \u201cWe\u2019re building the first regulated crypto fund, prime broker and storage.\u201d The prime brokerage element suggests there could be leverage and shorting involved in the trades. He launched the new crypto initiative in May 2017, according to the profile, but the fund appears to be getting liftoff now.\nThe CryptoFinance fund targets institutional investors such as banks, asset management firms and wealth management offices instead of Main Street. It tracks an index that\u2019s calculated by\u00a0SIX Swiss Exchange AG, a stock exchange, and is thus far comprised of bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Litecoin, weighted by market cap.\u00a0 Eventually, the index that the new fund tracks will contain the price of nearly a dozen cryptocurrencies.\nThe bitcoin price plummeted more than 10%\u00a0on Jan. 23 alone to near the $10,000 level, and similar price swings would be reflected in the performance of the fund. Check out this one-month chart of the bitcoin market cap below:Brzezek is the first to acknowledge, however, that volatility in cryptocurrencies is \u201cexceptionally high\u201d versus traditional asset classes.

The banker went a step further, stressing that cryptocurrencies are yet to be understood and any regulation should be measured and considered, not reactionary.\n\u201cBefore trying to regulate it, it is necessary to maintain a normal background around the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency,\u201d Gref said. \u201cIt is necessary to explain to people that it does not store value, but right now is rather a very dangerous thing, like a lottery or a casino,\u201d he added, presumably referencing the soaring rise in adoption, among retail investors & everyday citizens, and value of cryptocurrencies in 2017.\nHe went on to add:\nIt [crypotocurrencies] should not be banned, as it is a great new technology in development, which no one is yet to comprehend.\nGref\u2019s latest comments see the banker doubling down on his position against a ban on any facet of the financial technology \u2013 be it blockchain applications or cryptocurrencies.

With the exception of Ethereum, most major cryptocurrencies such as Ripple and Bitcoin Cash have decreased significantly, by more than 50 percent.\nWhile the price of bitcoin has dropped substantially, Kelly stated that the market is experiencing a shift in trend in which volumes are migrating from the Asian market to US and Europe-based retail traders. Through bitcoin futures and strictly regulated exchanges, an increasing number of institutional investors have started to invest in the cryptocurrency market. \n\u201cNow, when everyone is saying \u2026 it\u2019s over, that\u2019s it, bitcoin is dead, for the 175th time. Now\u2019s the time you start looking at it, on the buy side. And that money is still coming in. The flows have not stopped. This is not the end of bitcoin,\u201d said Kelly.\nEven though the cryptocurrency market has evolved into a $550 billion industry, bitcoin remains as the only cryptocurrency with the backing of institutional investors, financial institutions, and strictly regulated exchanges like the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and CME Group.\nThus, while alternative cryptocurrencies have become significantly more popular over the past six months, institutional investors that enter the cryptocurrency market will invest in bitcoin first, before planning to diversify their assets to other cryptocurrencies. \nIt is also important to acknowledge that the tax return filing season in the US is imminent and the South Korean cryptocurrency market is expected to enable new investors to open trading accounts by the end of January. These two factors will likely contribute to a surge in the volume and price of major cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin. \nCaution\nKelly emphasized that the cryptocurrency market is a bull market and the vast majority of investors within it are highly optimistic and enthusiastic. But, he noted that investors must be able to handle 20 to 30 percent corrections, as major corrections are regular events in the cryptocurrency sector. \n\u201cThese things can move 20 percent to 30 percent in a day,\u201d said Kelly, noting that one critical mistake investors in the sector often make is selling too early. \u201cOnce there\u2019s momentum, you hold onto this thing [even if it is up 20 to 30 percent].\u201d\nAs Litecoin creator Charlie Lee stated previously, a bull cycle is almost always followed by a bear market. Bitcoin and most major cryptocurrencies have had an incredible year in 2017 in terms of user growth, increase in market valuation, and mainstream exposure. Throughout December and January, the market has experienced some of the largest corrections in the past few years.\nHowever, as a bull cycle is followed a bear market, a bear cycle is also followed by a bull market. As the cryptocurrency market continues to recover from its recent corrections, bitcoin, being the reserve asset of the market, will likely increase in value in the short-term.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

The ERC20 currency will be launched during the company\u2019s Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Pre-sales in the ICO commenced yesterday.\nCashBet, an Oakland, California-based online gaming business, already features Arsenal footballers on their website. The company claims to be the \u2018only mobile-first platform for real-money, social, and skill-based interactive gaming\u2019. The platform offers casino and sports betting features among others.\n\n\u00a0\nThe agreement with the sporting giant will provide in-stadium advertising at Arsenal home Premier League games at Emirates Stadium. The Premier League boasts a global \u2018reach\u2019 of over 600 million homes, with a typical match watched live by up to 80 million people worldwide. Arsenal was the third highest earning club in England in the 2016-17 season, behind only Manchester United and Manchester City. \nA storied club with thirteen League titles and a record thirteen FA Cups, Arsenal are said to be the most popular football team in China. They are also wildly popular in Southeast Asia, with an online merchandise store dedicated to serving the region. The store lists prices in Malaysian Ringgit, Indian Rupees, Thai Baht, Vietnamese Dong and Singaporean Dollars.\nThe deal with CashBet Coin is a first in the cryptocurrency world. While gambling agencies have long been prominent sponsors of sporting clubs, and while CashBet is regulated by the Gambling Commission in the UK, ICOs are unregulated. Ernst & Young only recently reported that of the $3.7 billion invested in ICOs in 2017, ten percent of it was lost or stolen.\nJoining Emirates Airlines, Gatorade, Puma, and Vitality Insurance, CashBet will be hoping to benefit from the exposure its Arsenal partnership will deliver.

So much so, Coinbase reportedly has over 13 million users, and even suffered outages amid trading frenzies last year. It got so popular, its app became number one on Apple\u2019s store after surpassing YouTube.\nPer the publication, Coinbase\u2019s $1.6 billion August valuation has now likely doubled, as the company was expected to do around $600 million in revenue last year. Bitcoin\u2019s bull run, that saw the company add over 100,000 users in a day in November, boosted the company\u2019s revenue past the $1 billion mark.\nCoinbase, just like any other exchange, makes its money off of fees. The more users trying to get in on the cryptocurrency \u2018craze\u2019, the more it makes. Its success, according to Recode, now attracted venture capitalists and private brokers who are trying to buy shares. However, it doesn\u2019t allow its current shareholders to sell to outside investors.\nIn a statement, the company stated:\n\u201cAs a private company, Coinbase does not allow trading of stock on secondary markets for a variety of reasons, including the fact that there is not full and equal information available to the market. We will take appropriate action if we find people have sold Coinbase shares in violation of our agreements not to do so.\u201d\nAs reported by CCN, Coinbase raised $100 million back in August, which means outside investors might have to wait a while before Coinbase is ready to raise more money. Problem is, some company insiders believe it may not fundraise again, meaning the August round could\u2019ve been its last before an IPO.\nThe tech publication even adds that investors who spoke to company leadership were told they couldn\u2019t currently buy Coinbase shares. One shareholder told the company he was constantly being pinged by secondary brokers, who were looking to get a small amount of shares. Another shareholder claimed venture capitalists were trying to see if he would part with any of his shares.\nWhile none of the conversation seemingly progressed to price specifics, Coinbase told Recode it wasn\u2019t aware of any secondary trades and declined to comment on being aware of any other stock conversations. The problem for outside investors, according to brokers, is that few shareholders are willing to sell, which makes it hard to price a deal.\nA solution could come later this year, as the company may launch a tender offer. This way shareholders would be authorized to sell their stock to new investors, once the company opens its books.\nWhile investors are seemingly falling head over heels for Coinbase, some in the cryptocurrency community aren\u2019t that happy with the company. Coinbase has been criticized for spamming the bitcoin mempool, contributing to the network\u2019s congestion. In response, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated that \u201cCoinbase is working on batching transactions, SegWit, and a number of other strategies to improve transaction backlog.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

The group, which actively manages investments in commodities such \u201cas energy, industrial metals, precious metals, and agricultural derivatives \u201d made waves today by announcing that they are launching their own cryptocurrency, Tiberius Coin.\nTiberius Coin\nThe Tiberius Group seems to be trying to avoid the extreme volatility associated with many traditional cryptocurrencies by using commodities so stable, that they are sometimes used to hedge against inflation. The group plans on distributing several different versions of the coin upon launch based on the uses of the underlying metal. One will contain rare metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold. Another will contain copper, tin, and zinc which are extremely common in industrial manufacturing. The third will be backed by aluminum, nickel, and cobalt which are extremely common in automobiles.\nLike most traditional commodities, the metals underpinning the assets will be stored in the warehouses and refineries around the world. The fund\u2019s move is part of a growing trend to use cryptocurrencies as marketing and publicity tools, following the steps of Kodak. While the coin surely has serious merit as an investment,\u00a0the premium some investors anticipate it will trade at due to retail interest could make it untenable for Tiberius\u2019 traditional client base: institutional investors. The move is a big one for such a small firm, with current assets under management at around $300 million. Pennies compared to the crypto market which just a few weeks ago was about 3/4 of the way to $1 trillion.\nA Growing Trend\nCryptocurrencies backed by real-world products have grown into billion dollar market caps lately with coins like PowerLedger commoditizing power. It\u2019s not even the first coin backed by metals, with Russian behemoth Goldmint\u00a0and Singapore\u2019s DigixGlobal\u00a0with similar product offerings around non-industrial metals space is becoming a fast-growing sector of the exploding cryptocurrency industry.\nWhat differentiates\u00a0Tiberius Group is the firms\u2019 trustworthiness among institutional investors. Unlike many cryptocurrency startups, Tiberius is a mature company with institutional clients, versatile investments, and experienced management.\nFinally, the Tiberius Group is planning on meeting all the regulatory requirements of Switzerland before launching, and likely will expand their legal coverage to other countries in the coming months.\nThe firm also nodded at launching\u00a0more currencies backed by single metals, or multiple metals in the near future. Either way, many investors feel this firm\u2019s foray into cryptocurrency represents the tip of the iceberg as more investment banks rush into the space.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

This according to a recent article in Business Insider, which cited the Nobel-winning economists from Davos, Switzerland at the 2018 World Ecomomic Forum in an interview with Bloomberg. While in 2001 he was able to prove that an imbalanced trade or deal could provide a glimpse into market forces such as unemployment, he fails to see the point of bitcoin except to circumvent the law.\nThe More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same\nStiglitz hasn\u2019t wavered from his take on bitcoin a little over a year ago\u00a0when he said that bitcoin was \u201cexaggerated,\u201d and that \u201cthe main use has been to circumvent tax authorities and regulation.\u201d\nInteresting how the more things change, the more they stay the same, as bitcoin has since\u00a0 experienced unprecedented demand, a stratospheric rise in the price and innovations leading to new applications for the cryptocurrency, such as lending even to the unbanked, while Stiglitz, a Columbia University professor, hasn\u2019t revised his views at all.\nThe Greater Divide\nOne of Stiglitz\u2019s books is entitled: \u201cThe Great Divide: Unequal Societies and What We Can Do About Them,\u201d taking aim at class warfare and inequality. While not perfect and not having escaped anti-money laundering efforts altogether, bitcoin at its best is designed for the social good and to bridge the gap between\u00a0unequal societies, extending an olive branch to the unbanked and removing the friction from cross-border transactions among migrant workers, for instance. In a sense, by dismissing bitcoin, he is creating a \u201cgreater divide\u201d within society and missing a solution that addresses the very inequality he fought against because the idea was not his own.\nStiglitz is taking a position that isn\u2019t uncommon among policymakers and bankers, pitting centralized fiat money against cryptocurrencies despite the fact that many in the crypto community have said that there is room for both.\n\u201cWe have a good medium of exchange called the dollar. We can trade in that. Why do people want bitcoin? For secrecy,\u201d said Stiglitz to Bloomberg.\nMeanwhile, as even blockchain pioneers such as Ripple\u2019s Brad Garlinghouse favor some form of regulation, Stiglitz, who previously served as the World Bank\u2019s top economist, suggests that regulating bitcoin would do more harm for the cryptocurrency cause than good.\n\u201cMy feeling is that when you regulate it so that you couldn\u2019t engage in money laundering and all these other things, there would be no demand for bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cSo by regulating the abuses you are going to regulate it out of existence,\u201d said Stiglitz, who next month turns 75.\nA tweet from Pralahad Belavadi\u2019s bot suggests that when economists finally demonstrate a \u201cfear of missing out\u201d and realize that the forces driving bitcoin are stronger than the forces against, bitcoin adoption will be complete.\n\nRT Datavetaren: Nerd FOMONerd friends FOMONerd friends friends FOMOHedge fund FOMOHedge fund friends FOMOWall street FOMOPoliticians FOMOGovernments FOMOEconomists FOMO#bitcoin adoption complete\n\u2014 Knight Blade (@knightblade_bot) December 11, 2017\n\nThat may be what this is all about, considering that when Stiglitz announced it was his decision to leave the World Bank as the chief economist nearly two decades ago, there was speculation that he was ousted.", "category": "Bitcoin Economics"}

Lower fees increase the accessibility of bitcoin for newcomers and casual users, especially to users that utilize bitcoin for small payments.\nEvidently, the recent decline in the transaction fee of bitcoin was triggered by the drop in the daily trading volume, not due to a specific scaling solution, given that major bitcoin companies are yet to adopt Segregated Witness (SegWit) and implement transaction batching technologies. \nAs such, when the price of bitcoin increases again and its daily trading volume rises, fees will inevitably go up again. The high fees of bitcoin prevent newcomers and casual users from seamlessly transacting and settling payments.\nHigh fees will likely have an impact on the price of bitcoin in the short-term, if the market recovers again. Innovative scaling solutions and swift implementation of SegWit by bitcoin firms are urgently needed to ensure bitcoin can recover to its previous highs.\nCardano\nThe demand for Cardano, better known as ADA in Japan and South Korea, is rising at a rapid rate in the Asian market. Many investors perceive Cardano as a competitor to Ethereum, as it also operates as a smart contracts protocol. The fundamental difference between Ethereum and Cardano is the utilization of proof-of-stake consensus algorithm by Cardano.\nBecause Cardano is traded frequently on South Korea\u2019s UpBit and Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges, recovery by the two markets will likely lead to an increase in the value of Cardano. The South Korean market is still awaiting the January 30 new account registration resumption by South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges. As new users enter the market, the price of cryptocurrencies like Cardano, Qtum, and EOS with strong followers in Asia are expected to increase in value.\nMajor cryptocurrencies will likely recover ahead of other alternative cryptocurrencies in the market in the short-term. As Brian Kelly of BKCM and CNBC\u2019s Fast Money noted, investment from institutional and retail traders are increasing at a rapid rate and it is unlikely that large-scale investors will target altcoins with small market valuations and less liquidity.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

China is also trying to control cryptocurrency, Weber reportedly said according to Bloomberg\nBanks Reluctant To Invest In Crypto\nWhile banks are exploring blockchain technology, they are hesitant to invest clients\u2019 funds in cryptocurrency because of regulatory concerns. This month, the European Commission announced it may increase its control over virtual currencies on account of an expected pricing bubble.\nTidjane Thiam, CEO of Credit Suisse Group AG, said bitcoin is in a bubble back in November. On Wednesday, he told listeners at Davos that he remains a blockchain fan and that digital currencies still have a future.\nEuropean banking executives have expressed doubts about cryptocurrency as an investment. Andrey Kostin, board chairman of Russia\u2019s VTB Bank PJSC, said there is no big future for bitcoin while speaking at Davos. Nordea Bank AB in Sweden has banned its employees from trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nBitcoin\u2019s Elasticity Causes Price Gains\nEvery increase in bitcoin\u2019s demand delivers a price increase since there is very little elasticity in bitcoin\u2019s supply, Weber said. He called on regulators to \u201czoom in\u201d on bitcoin, which traded at $11,076 on Wednesday, having fallen from $18,675 on Dec. 18.\nMark Haefele \u2014 chief investment officer of UBS \u2014 said in November that bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem\u2019s lack of government oversight presents investors with an \u201cunquantifiable risk.\u201d\nMoreover, questioning that purchases of cryptocurrency should even be classified as investments, he stated that firms have no way to develop a clear exit strategy to secure profits.\nBitcoin Still Not Significant Enough\nEven discounting those factors, Haefele said bitcoin does not even appear on UBS\u2019s investment radar. Throwing shade on the significant growth experienced by the ecosystem this year, he stated that the approximately $230 billion cryptocurrency market cap was \u201cnot even the size of some of the smaller currencies\u201d that UBS would include in its portfolio.\nFormer UBS banker Jan Brzezek, meanwhile, has launched a new cryptocurrency fund and is targeting $10 million by month\u2019s end. The crypto fund is currently domiciled offshore and is passive in nature (though an active product is planned for the summer), tracking the performance of the maiden blue-chip index for cryptocurrencies, said Brzezek.

The company has signed deals with IDT Corporation and MercuryFX, two international payment providers that handle hundreds of millions of transactions worldwide per year.\nBoth companies will be using Ripple\u2019s xRapid platform, which allows institutions to save on the cost of accessing and providing liquidity to their customers.\nThe Real Value of Ripple\nRipple wants to prove xRapid is faster and cheaper than other means of payment. The platform is designed to allow global money transfer services and central banks to free up capital normally tied up in what are known as nostro and vostro accounts.\nNostro vs. Vostro\nA nostro account is when a domestic bank owns an account at a foreign bank in that foreign bank\u2019s national currency. To the foreign bank in this scenario, that very same account is considered vostro (latin for \u201cyours\u201d). The money being held is in the local currency, but the funds belong to the foreign institution.\nIn this context, we\u2019re talking about banks and global payment providers that have hundreds of millions of dollars in liquid assets held between one another at all times. Imagine putting those funds on a third party platform locked down by a blockchain. Now money can flow more freely, saving time and and cutting down on expenses for all parties involved.\nPartnerships Galore\nThe two newest additions to the Ripple family have helped the company start 2018 with a bang. Earlier this month, Money Gram, the second largest global payment provider in the world announced they would use xRapid, as well as Mexican bank Cuallix.\nIn November of last year, Ripple announced a deal with credit card issuer American Express. An Amex executive commented that Ripple\u2019s platform would play a transformational role in the way customers are served.\nThe complete list of current Ripple partners is indeed a long one, listing over 100 central banks and many more payment providers. It seems that list is only going to grow longer and longer as more and more payment providers look to free up liquidity and lower their costs in a way they were never able to do before.\nPresent-day Outlook\nRipple\u2019s XRP token is up over 500% over the last year and CEO Brad Carlinghouse recently stated that there are plenty of major announcements to come regarding partnerships with major players.\n\nThe company won\u2019t release that information until partners are ready to reveal themselves. But while confidential information may be held that way for a while, organizations dealing with Ripple can rest assured that large volumes of money are going to be able to flow more freely than ever before.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

With the idea being so new to the Nigerians, it attracted many people and groups that took advantage of the people\u2019s little knowledge of the new concept to robe them.\nTop Global Scams Target Nigerians\nWith bitcoin quickly gaining popularity, the rise of scams involving the cryptocurrency was inevitable. This included the Mavrodi Mondial Mondial Moneybox (MMM) a 30-year-long global Ponzi scheme, that robbed millions of Nigerians with promises of\u00a030 percent returns in as little as 30 days. When the government began to crack down on bank accounts linked to the scheme, MMM\u2019s operators cut the banks out and started requiring victims to use Bitcoin It was this scheme that made Nigerians understand how Bitcoin worked. But out of all that chaos, something fascinating happened: people realized that bitcoin was just as valuable as money and that bitcoin is the future.\nSome of the techniques used in scamming the Nigerians includes a method known as cloning, this is whereby a scammer uses the name and photo of a real dealer and creates a trading profile on a local exchange that\u2019s good enough to pass a cursory background check. According to Bloomberg, others will make an offer not of Bitcoin, but of \u201cbillion coin\u201d or some other nonexistent cryptocurrency.\nGovernment Steps In to Combat Ponzi Schemes\nLike in any other Ponzi scheme, the early investors in Nigeria\u2019s bitcoin scams get paid with the money coming from subsequent investors. Since this kind of maneuver relies on new sign-ups, the scheme would collapse if no new investors are drawn in. To combat these scams involving something that\u2019s not properly regulated and having lost billions of Naira the government, individuals and other groups have taken the initiative to curb scams and scammers which according to Bloomberg Business week includes; Formation of educative groups as one of the educative group leaders stated that \u201cA lot of people have had their fingers burned,\u201d and hence the importance to educate regulators and the public about digital currency. Cryptographic Development Initiative of Nigeria is one of this educative group that was founded by Adeolu Fade.\nThe development of informal groups of traders who had to take the old approach of verifying transactions is the other method used by Nigerians to deal with scammers. This method is whereby they set up an informal exchange on popular encrypted messaging app Telegram, trading among themselves. When other friends sought to join the group, the group leader would review their identification and banking documents, comparing passports and papers with the faces in front of him. Sometimes he\u2019d even have to act as a trusted broker, holding a buyer\u2019s money in escrow until the seller came through with the Bitcoin transfer. Many networks have been formulated with each having different security measures. Whereby some even arrange face-to-face meetings in homes, the backs of small shops, and other private places, where a buyer hands over hard cash and watches the seller make the Bitcoin transfer on a smartphone.\nOn individual basis because of Nigeria\u2019s high fraud rates, online sellers do not process payments from Nigerian credit cards. This is why bitcoin has become an attractive option for consumers there. With bitcoin, there aren\u2019t any costly chargebacks, and on the basis of transaction origin, it can\u2019t be blocked. The majority of Nigerians keep it as an alternative asset class by using it as a store of value.\nThose living in any politically and economically unstable country could tell you, anything that leads to money entails its fair share of deceptions and unlawfulness that the government would rather turn a blind eye to, let alone fix. The cryptocurrency enthusiasts in Nigeria are doing everything possible to make sure this market is clean and absent of fraudulence even if it means following the most primitive and uninspiring method possible.", "category": "Bitcoin Scams"}

Like most cryptocurrencies, Steem experienced significant appreciation throughout the year, but it largely lagged the market index during the fourth quarter \u2014 until December, that is.\nDuring the final month of the year, the Steem price exploded, leaping from $1 on Dec. 1 to a new all-time high of $7.31 on Jan. 3, fueled largely by heavy trading volume in South Korea. The rally was as unsustainable as it was inexplicable, and by Jan. 17 the Steem price had declined to $2.89.\nThis week, however, the Steem price made a renewed push, and on Thursday it rose 50 percent in just 24 hours to reach $6.51 on Bittrex, which provides the token with a $1.6 billion market cap.\nSteem Price Chart\nOne slightly concerning factor is that more than 87 percent of Steem\u2019s daily trading volume is concentrated on a single trading platform: South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit. While one never wants to see trading volume centralized on a single exchange or in a single market, this is especially true of South Korea, given that regulators have wavered in their stance toward the country\u2019s booming cryptocurrency markets.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nSteem Price Surges After Weiss Gives Bullish Rating\nThe Steem price\u2019s current rally appears to be linked to the publication of the \u201cWeiss Report.\u201d Earlier this week, Weiss Ratings released its cryptocurrency grades, which it says are the first ever given by a rating agency. The ratings, which quickly leaked online, have been widely panned by cryptocurrency insiders.\nBitcoin, for instance, received just a C+, leading Charles Hoskinson \u2014 a co-founder of both Ethereum and Cardano \u2014 to say that the report has \u201csome screws loose.\u201d\n\nAny rating that doesn't give Bitcoin an A has got some screws loose. Nearly ten years of wealth creation, innovation, massive growth, proven resiliency against crashes and billions worth of infrastructure. And all without a leader. Bitcoin is the standard\n\u2014 Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) January 24, 2018\n\nBut although the report received mainstream ridicule, it proved to be bullish for Steem, which was one of only five cryptocurrencies to receive at least a B- grade. Of this exclusive group \u2014 which also included Ethereum, Cardano, EOS, and NEO \u2014 Steem is the only cryptocurrency that is not currently one of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies, as measured by market cap.\nConsequently, the Weiss ratings provided Steem with unusual media exposure and gave it the appearance of an undervalued commodity, leading to its mid-week surge.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

At present, it is valued at $551 billion, which represents a 24-hour increase of about two percent.\nBitcoin Price Holds Above $11,100\nThe Bitcoin price traded sideways on Thursday.

This decline \u2014 which was worst among top 10-cryptocurrencies \u2014 came even as two more payment providers\u00a0announced that they would integrate XRP into their remittance systems.\nThe Bitcoin Cash price, meanwhile, declined by two percent to $1,627, which reduced its market cap to $27.6 billion.\nThe next three coins, on the other hand, managed to post relatively strong returns. Cardano, ranked fifth,\u00a0 rose four percent to $0.64, perhaps because it received a strong rating from the controversial \u201cWeiss Report.\u201d EOS, another token favored by the Weiss ratings, achieved a three percent increase to $13.78.\nStellar posted the most impressive gain of any top-tier cryptocurrency, rising eight percent to about $0.63 despite receiving a poor rating from Weiss. The Stellar price\u2019s climb is likely linked to payment processor Stripe\u2019s recent suggestion that it may add support for XLM payments in the future.\nFrom here, though, the charts once again turn sour. The Litecoin price declined by three percent to $1.78, while NEM dropped four percent to $0.99.

The Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed charges against My Big Coin (MBC) and its founders for misappropriating more than $6 million from customers in a cryptocurrency-fueled Ponzi scheme. While the company gave the illusion it had inked a deal with Mastercard, not to mention promoting a gold-backed coin for its digital wallet, investors eventually grew suspicious only to have those concerns squashed by the company under the guise of more coins.\nThe agency filed the complaint in a Massachusetts court on Jan. 16, charging the Nevada-based startup as well as founder Randall Crater and his associate Mark Gillespie, of New York and Michigan, respectively, with fraud and misappropriation of the funds, which they collected from non-suspecting investors in My Big Coin and redirected into their personal bank accounts, for personal expenses and to go on a shopping spree.\nMy Big Coin\u2019s attorney Adam Tracy is quoted by Reuters as saying:\n\u201cThe allegations contained in the CFTC\u2019s complaint are just that, allegations, and I\u2019ll be working with client in coming days to formulate a response to the complaint.\u201d\nGold-Backed Coin Ponzi?\nMBC touted its coin as a gold-backed cryptocurrency, which helped them to attract $6 million-plus to their coffers since 2014, the lion\u2019s share of which came from the state of Massachusetts.

Speaking to Bloomberg, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief financial officer Jonathan Pruzan revealed the bank has already been clearing Bitcoin futures contracts \u2018for big institutional clients\u2019.\nBitcoin rode into Wall Street last month after the launch of futures contracts on exchanges operated by CBOE on December 10 and the CME Group on December 18.\nFurther, Pruzan also added that the bank regularly convenes internal meetings with executives on \u2018how else to engage with cryptocurrencies.\u2019\nWhile being coy on details of buy-ins or collaterals for bitcoin futures trades, he added:\n\u201cIf someone wants to do a trade on the [bitcoin] futures and settle in cash, we\u2019ll do that. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been a lot of activity, but it\u2019s for core institutional clients who want to participate in a derivatives transaction.\u201d\nBitcoin\u2019s volatility is a factor in the bank determining margin levels for trades, he revealed, before stating Morgan Stanley executives have been \u201cmonitoring very closely\u201d the possibility of enhancing their services to crypto-interested clients through market-making (which would involve Morgan Stanley holding cryptocurrencies) or even custody of clients\u2019 cryptocurrencies.\nContrary to its Wall Street rivals, Morgan Stanley\u2019s embracive approach to cryptocurrencies was first hinted at by chief executive James Dorman last year. Taking stage at a public event, the influential Wall Street banker was asked about for his take on cryptocurrencies, within weeks of JP Morgan chief Jamie Dimon\u2019s infamous remark of calling bitcoin a \u2018fraud\u2019 \u00a0\u2013 a statement that Dimon has since expressed regret over.\nGorman, who opined bitcoin should not be made \u2018illegal\u2019, said:\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating development, that\u2019s certainly something more than just a fad.\u201d\nThe crypocurrency-related offering from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley is in marked contrast to the stance taken by Bank of America\u2019s brokerage arm Merrill Lynch, which is keeping its clients and barring its financial advisers from participating in bitcoin investments.", "category": "Banking"}

In addition to simple pricing data, ICE will provide clients with detailed information about exchange order books, which will help them anticipate market moves and take advantage of arbitrage opportunities that occur as the result of pricing discrepancies between exchanges.\n\u201cWith the broad array of cryptocurrencies and exchanges, and given the price variances between exchanges, it\u2019s critical that investors have a comprehensive source of pricing information,\u201d said ICE Data Services President and COO, Lynn Martin, in a statement.\nInitially, the Cryptocurrency Data Feed will provide real-time, end of day, and historical data for six cryptocurrencies: bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, and dash.\nBlockstream said that the service will launch with data from more than 15 cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bitbank, Bitfinex, BitMEX, Bitso, Bitstamp, BtcBox, BTCC, CEX, Coinfloor, Coincheck, ItBit, Gopax, OKEx, SurBTC, The Rock Trading, Unocoin, Vaultoro, and Zaif. Additional exchanges are expected to contribute data in the future.\nInstitutions Eye Entry into Cryptoasset Markets\nThe creation of the Cryptocurrency Data Feed is likely an indication that institutional investors, most of whom have been hesitant to make direct investments in the cryptoasset markets, are clamoring for the professional-quality tools that would enable them to navigate the ecosystem effectively.\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Martin said that ICE had received numerous requests from institutional investors for a service that would increase the transparency of the spot markets, although she declined to name interested firms.\nAt present, most websites that provide cryptocurrency market data target retail investors, and their lack of transparency can create systemic risks for high-volume traders. Earlier this month, for instance, popular website CoinMarketCap triggered an apparent market selloff after it removed South Korean exchange data from its pricing algorithm without warning.\nFor ICE, the move represents yet another bid to position itself and its subsidiaries at the forefront of the burgeoning institutional cryptoasset marketplace. Although the company was hesitant to list bitcoin futures, it has made several attempts to list the first exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of bitcoin futures (Bitcoin ETF). However, these proposals have yet to earn approval from regulators.", "category": "Banking"}

He is the proud new owner of a full Bitcoin after deciphering a code hidden in strands of DNA.\nBritish professor Nick Goldman laid out a challenge to scientists at the 2015 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The challenge was for a scientist to uncover information embedded inside strands of DNA that would provide the winner with instructions on how to claim one full Bitcoin.\nAlthough the challenge has now come to a conclusion after three full years, Wuyts only began participating in the project at the end of 2017. He used DNA sequencers and organized a small group of his colleagues to participate in a hackathon.\nA short time later they had cracked the code revealing the logo of the European Bioinformatics Institute, a picture of James Joyce, and instructions on how to claim the grand prize.\nMore On DNA and Data Storage\nProfessor Goldman maintains that a very large amount of data can be held within a very small sequence of DNA. How much data you ask? Approximately 215 million gigabytes in just one gram of DNA. While it sounds too good to be true, the earliest known research done on DNA and data storage first took place way back in the mid-1960s when scientist Mikhail Neiman published his earliest ideas.\nFast-forward to 2007. Researchers at the University of Arizona create a device that can detect mismatching sites within a single strand of DNA. These mismatches could be used to uncover embedded data.\nFive years later, researchers at Harvard University uncovered JavaScript coding and Shakespearean sonnets among other information hidden in strands of DNA.\nTo HODL, Or Not To HODL?\nWuyts hasn\u2019t decided what he\u2019ll do with his reward just yet. Nobody should blame him given how volatile the price of Bitcoin has been to start 2018.\nFor now, Wuyts says he\u2019ll use some of his earnings to celebrate with his colleagues and saved some of it to fund further research. While pessimistic at first, Wuyts now believes in DNA as a viable option for storing data in the future.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nWhile storing data in DNA is certainly promising, a modern day hard drive is still light years ahead of what scientists can decode. Only a few hundred bytes of information per second can be uncovered using today\u2019s scientific technologies while the average hard drive can process millions of bytes in the same time span.\nOn the flipside, the one advantage of storing data within DNA as opposed to on a hard drive is that DNA can withstand an estimated 2,000 years of archival decay, where hard drive usually gets thrown away after a few years.\nEither way, it sounds like programmers may be building blockchains on nature\u2019s ultimate blockchain someday.

Just as critics were rushing to proclaim that the bitcoin bubble had burst, the markets staged a $159 billion recovery. The rally was headlined by the bitcoin price, which rebounded from its sub-$10,000 fling and is currently flirting with $12,000. Several other top-tier coins, meanwhile, returned single day increases in excess of 40 percent.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nAltogether, the cryptocurrency market cap clawed its way back to $574 billion, representing a 38 percent recovery from Wednesday\u2019s intraday low of $415 billion.\nBitcoin Price Eyes $12,000\nWednesday served as a trial-by-fire for recent bitcoin investors, some of whom had purchased the flagship cryptocurrency for $19,000 at the height of the rally in mid-December.\nBitcoin Price Chart\nThe correction forced the bitcoin price below $10,000 for the first time since early December, but Thursday\u2019s rally enabled bitcoin to regain a bit of the ground it had lost during the downturn. The bitcoin price rose 14 percent for the day, rising as high as $11,901 on Bitfinex before ebbing back to a present value of $11,451. Bitcoin now has a market cap of $193.9 billion.\nEthereum Price Recovers Past $1,000\nThe Ethereum price made a similar recovery, climbing 19 percent to $1,037 after dipping as low as $781 on Wednesday afternoon. Ethereum now has a $101.1 billion market cap.\nEthereum Price Chart\n\u00a0Ripple Price Leads the Markets With 57% Surge\nThursday\u2019s recovery lifted virtually all cryptocurrencies against the US dollar, but no top-tier coin returned a better performance than Ripple. The ripple price surged by 57 percent to $1.61, restoring its market cap to $61.6 billion.\nRipple Price Chart\nSeveral factors contributed to Ripple\u2019s outsized performance, including reduced fears that South Korea \u2014 by far XRP\u2019s largest market \u2014 will attempt to implement a blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading.\nAdditionally, a major South Korean bank announced that it will conduct a second blockchain trial using Ripple\u2019s enterprise blockchain.

As CCN recently reported, the Portuguese branch of Spanish bank Santander, Banco Santander Totta, is halting bitcoin-related transactions while claiming cryptocurrency exchanges are transacting in non-regulated financial products.\nAs reported, the bank is refusing to process transactions to and from popular exchanges like Coinbase and Bitstamp. Speaking to a client, an employee even revealed the existence of an internal directive to block transactions using Coinbase\u2019s IBAN. In response, some of its clients changed banks, while others decided to call in DECO, the Portuguese consumer protection organization, to help them out.\nThrough an article on its website, DECO addressed the issue by making it clear Santander Totta, to the organization, \u201chas no known legal basis\u201d to support its move. The piece reads (roughly translated):\n\u201cSantander\u2019s barriers on international interbank transfers to bank accounts associated with cryptocurrency sites are not supported by any known legal basis.\u201d\nThe consumer protection organization added that Portugal\u2019s central bank, Banco de Portugal, previously sent them a statement restating bitcoin has no legal framework in the country. As such, bitcoin-related activities are outside the financial institution\u2019s supervision.\nThe central bank restated its warning against cryptocurrency investments, and added it doesn\u2019t advise people to accept bitcoin payments, as it considers cryptocurrencies a risky investment.\nSantander Totta responds\nIn response to the backlash, Santander Totta sent the press an update on the situation that led some of its clients to change banks.

And now we are seeing an overreaction of the downward side\u201d, Singh said in an interview with Bloomberg yesterday.\nHe spoke about the recent changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin went as high as $17,000 in the first week of this year, and then dropped below $10,000. Similarly, Ripple dropped by 28% within 24 hours on Wednesday.\nWhen asked what Singh thought of these sudden crashes, he said it was \u2018exciting\u2019, \u201cWhat\u2019s another 25% drop amongst friends I always say right? So, it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\nWhile analysts have been calling Bitcoin a bubble, a topic as old as the cryptocurrency itself, others are blaming price fluctuations on uncertainty in regulations.\nSingh explained, \u201cSo, there\u2019s talk about, you know, Asian regulators trying to manage and maybe ban some crypto exchanges in Korea. China\u2019s already been stopped from bitcoin trading for a while and now Korea\u2019s in focus.\u201d\nAccording to him, regulators are not planning on banning cryptocurrencies but only \u2018regulate [them] more\u2019 to make the entire process legal. He believes this move will be in favor of the crypto market.\nCo-host Cory Johnson agreed with Singh and pointed out that as soon as people realize that an Asian country might change its laws for cryptocurrencies, the prices take a plunge.\nSonny Singh: Smooth-sailing at Bitpay\nSingh clarified that transactions on BitPay were not affected by the recent developments in Bitcoin. He said, \u201cSo we checked, we actually had a record, obviously, December. Then for the last coupe of weeks we\u2019ve been right on schedule to keep up with that same volume so we don\u2019t see any difference in our volume actually.\u201d\nSingh, who has 15+ years of experience in advising tech companies, is not worried or concerned about the future of Bitcoin. Since, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap saw 16X rise in a span of one year, a correction of 25% is not a big deal. He agrees that Bitcoin is volatile which is why it could rise to its original price in no time.\n\u201cThis is the first drop we\u2019ve seen though in the last year when a lot of new retail buyers have come in. So it\u2019s new for a lot of new people. But people who have been in the industry for four or five years, this happens quite often actually\u201d, Singh concluded.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

While a tax was inevitable, it is also a sign of maturity within the ballooning ICO market, which raised more than $4 billion last year.\nOne ICO that under the new law may have been subject to the tax is Swiss-Israeli startup Sirin Labs. The startup, which is developing a blockchain smartphone and which issued the SRN tokens, attracting $118 million to its coffers in an ICO at year-end 2017.\nThe draft makes it clear that it\u2019s addressing utility tokens, which is how the lion\u2019s share of issuers characterize their digital coins as opposed to securities, with tax authority director Moshe Asher emphasizing transparency.\n\u201cThe Tax Authority is monitoring the technological developments and is working\u00a0to provide an answer regarding the tax implications of virtual currency\u00a0transactions and the issuance\u00a0of\u00a0digital tokens, thereby increasing the certainty and tax transparency of those operating in the field.\u201d\nSimilar to a recent declaration by the Tax Authority to treat\u00a0bitcoin as an asset, ICO tokens\u00a0are being deemed an asset, and issuing companies behind them as well as the investors who buy the tokens would be subject to the tax. It\u2019s a balance sheet event, with companies being required to report P&L with cryptocurrencies similar to how they would with other assets. The tax may be postponed until the product in development is actually supplied. According to the draft, as translated by Finance Magnates:\n\u201cA person whose income from the sale of tokens reaches the level of a business, his income will be classified as a business income and it will be subject to tax rates under sections 121 or 126 of the ordinance.\u201d\nBack to Barter\nIsrael\u2019s central bank previously revealed its position on bitcoin, saying that it didn\u2019t recognize the cryptocurrency or altcoins as a legitimate form of payment. Meanwhile, The Tax Authority\u2019s draft legislation addresses bitcoin, saying\u00a0that transactions\u00a0involving the cryptocurrency would be treated as barter based on the value of assets.\nIsrael\u2019s securities regulator previously moved to block bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Taxing ICOs sends a message to issuers that\u00a0while they may dream of being the next bitcoin, their cryptocurrency similarly\u00a0will\u00a0have limitations. Israel is currently pursuing a digital shekel, whose value would be equal to the country\u2019s fiat money.\nPublic comments on the proposed law are being accepted for two weeks before the rule becomes final.", "category": "Bitcoin Law"}

Merely hours later the press conference was aired on national TV, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance along with the Blue House, the executive office of President Moon Jae-in, officially refuted the potential of imposing a cryptocurrency trading ban.\n\u201cThe cryptocurrency trading ban proposal introduced by Justice Minister Park Sang-ki was a suggestion made by the Justice Ministry on December 28 to bring speculation within the cryptocurrency market under control. The proposal will be discussed and changed by the task force participated by the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, central bank, Fair Trade Commission, and other agencies,\u201d said Blue House spokesperson Jeong Ki-joon.\nAt a financial committee hearing, FSC director Choi admitted that several officials within the agency committed insider trading by obtaining knowledge about the Justice Ministry\u2019s statement prior to its release and selling bitcoin immediately before the statement was introduced to the public.\nHong Nam-ki, the head of the state coordination division, clarified at the hearing that the employees or officials who are accused of initiating insider trading will be investigated and punished accordingly by law. Hong emphasized that the agency will likely enforce a law to prohibit officials within the agency from trading cryptocurrencies, as it would prevent the agency, which is a part of the cryptocurrency regulation task force established by the government, from being neutral and transparent in regulating the cryptocurrency market. \n\u201cThe government is currently investigating into the several government officials that were alleged to have initiated insider trading. Given that it is not appropriate for a government official to trade cryptocurrencies, the agency will encourage its employees to prevent from trading cryptocurrencies i the short-term.\u201d\nCitizens Outrage\nSouth Korean citizens, who already submitted a petition to the Blue House signed by more than 250,000 citizens to reject the cryptocurrency trading ban, were outraged once again by the negligence demonstrated by the FSC, an agency that is supposed to remain neutral for the benefit of the market and consumers.\nThe FSC will undeniably have to face questions on whether insider trading initiated by the officials within the agency impacted the motivation of Justice Minister to release such a statement in a press conference in the future.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

The delegation is luring Qatar by \u2018currently negotiating discounts\u2019 ahead of the oil-backed cryptocurrency\u2019s upcoming \u2018sale\u2019 in February, the report added.\nIt\u2019s notable that Venezuela is reaching out to Qatar to buy into its cryptocurrency. Qatar is facing its own economic blockade by a Saudi-led coalition since mid-2016 and has been making friends elsewhere by purchasing Airbus commercial planes from France ($6.35 billion), warships from Italy ($5..91 billion), 24 Typhoon fighter jets from the UK ($8 billion) and a $12 billion deal with the US for 72 F-15 fighter jets.\nThe Pre-Sale\nA month-long \u2018private pre-sale\u201d will begin on February 15, where government officials expect to raise as much as $1.3 billion, before the sale extends to individuals. Venezuela\u2019s government also intends to pay public workers in the digital token before encouraging them to use the cryptocurrency with tax benefits.\nAs reported in December, controversial Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro first announced the state cryptocurrency as a solution to circumvent economic sanctions imposed by the United States\u2019 presidential administration. The sanctions have proved a crippling blockade, cutting Venezuela\u2019s access to global finance and international banking. Petro will be primarily backed by oil, Maduro said, alongside other commodities in gold and diamonds.\nOn January 9, Maduro doubled down on the plan to launch the petro by announcing the upcoming issuance of 100 million petros \u2013 some of which is currently being offered on a discount to Qatar. Each petro will be backed by an oil barrel in Venezuela\u2019s reserves, valuing the first issuance of the petro at approximately $6 billion.\nThe following day, the opposition-run Venezuelan congress outlawed Maduro\u2019s petro as an \u201cillegal and unconstitutional\u201d instrument that was effectively \u201can effort to illegally mortgage\u201d Venezuela\u2019s oil reserves.\nThe Venezuelan Parliament\u2019s legislator Jorge Milan said:\n\u201cThis is not a cryptocurrency, this is a forward sale of Venezuelan oil.

But recent volatility has also unearthed an unlikely trend, causing cybercriminals to forego the sci-fi effect in ransomware demands and name their price in local currency rather than bitcoin.\nIt\u2019s not that bad actors have stopped developing malware, but due to an\u00a0inability to properly value the cryptocurrency amid the wild ride between Q4 2017 and this week, they\u2019re\u00a0increasingly turning to more stable fiat money instead to protect their bottom line, according to a Proofpoint report. The below chart reflects activity for the 90-day period leading up to mid-December.\n\n\u00a0\nWhile it may not be commonplace to think of cybercriminals as running a business, that\u2019s what they\u2019re attempting to do, albeit on the dark side. And like any business owner, they must attach a value to the nefarious services they are engaged in \u2014 but a volatile bitcoin price makes it difficult for them to do so.\u00a0The pendulum began to shift from demanding bitcoin to government-issued currency in November with the Sigma virus, whose ransomware was denominated in US dollars.\nThat was only the beginning, as the volatility in the bitcoin price only became more pronounced in December.\u00a0 As a result, there was a 75% drop-off in bitcoin-denominated ransomware demands in Q4 2017.\u00a0 This was in stark contrast to the trend over the past two years during which time cyber thieves mostly held data ransom in exchange for bitcoin.\nAccording to the report:\n\u201cDenominating ransoms in a government-issued currency\u2014even if the actual payment is made in the form of Bitcoin\u2014has two big benefits for an attacker. It allows the threat actors to maintain pricing stability and still accept their payments anonymously, and in a currency that, for the moment, continues to appreciate quickly.\u201d\nBitcoin Antidote\nMeanwhile, the bitcoin\u00a0volatility over the Christmas holiday was no joke, with the bitcoin price approaching $20,000 and falling below $11,000 all in a matter of days, but this month\u2019s trading activity could bring cyber thieves back. According to the Proofpoint report, making demands in traditional currency instead of cryptocurrency is a reflection of a rising bitcoin price. \u201cThe trend,\u201d they say, \u201cmay reverse if bitcoin falls back to earth.\u201d Ultimately, bad actors are after one thing \u2014 \u201cshow me the money,\u201d whether it\u2019s fiat money or cryptocurrency that inflates their bottom line.", "category": "Bitcoin Crime"}

Both Bithumb and UpBit are operated by some of the country\u2019s most influential conglomerates including Kakao\u2019s Dunamoo. Korbit, the third largest cryptocurrency exchange market, is operated by NXC, a $10 billion gaming company.\nTo compete against local trading platforms like Bithumb, Korbit, UpBit, and CoinOne, OKCoin has partnered with a major conglomerate in NHN Entertainment, to obtain sufficient resources and capital to address the South Korean market. OKCoin will also integrate 60 cryptocurrencies upon its launch, more than all of the cryptocurrency exchanges in the local market combined.\nChris Lee, the president of OKCoin, told News 1 that the company currently houses 100 full-time developers and is aiming to evolve into a global cryptocurrency exchange. Lee emphasized that in order for OKCoin to expand internationally, South Korea is an important market for the company to address and penetrate.\nLast month, Huobi, another major Chinese cryptocurrency exchange that migrated to the Hong Kong cryptocurrency market, announced its partnership with Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings to expand into the Japanese and South Korean markets.\nDue to the recent crackdown on cryptocurrency trading by the Chinese government, trading platforms within the Chinese market have started to expand into other major regions in Asia, such as Japan and South Korea.\nOptimistic For South Korea?\nApart from OKCoin and Huobi, 10 more cryptocurrency exchanges are expected to launch in the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market over the next few months. \nEvidently, if the South Korean cryptocurrency market is unstable and a trading ban is imminent, cryptocurrency exchanges would not allocate millions of dollars in development and compliance to expand into the South Korean market.\nLocal exchanges including Bithumb, Korbit, and Coinone, as well as exchanges overseas like Huobi and OKCoin are optimistic in regards to the regulatory roadmap of the South Korean government, given that the government has reaffirmed a cryptocurrency trading ban will not be imposed.\nRecently, as CCN reported, chairman of the Fair Trade Commission of South Korea Kim Sang-Joo, stated:\n\u201c[Shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges] is not realistically possible. Based on electronic commerce law, the government does not have the authority to close down cryptocurrency trading platforms.\nFrom the viewpoint of an economist, it is not a fair and transparent decision to outright ban economic activity.

Citing this report, Credit Suisse said that bitcoin mining is unlikely to cause an \u201cenvironmental Armageddon\u201d \u2014 at least anytime soon.\n\u201cThis is a far cry from the power and environmental Armageddon that some have feared,\u201d the Credit Suisse analysts, led by Michael Weinstein, wrote in this week\u2019s report, according to Bloomberg.\nThey added that it is a mistake to project miners\u2019 power consumption lineally, as the industry will likely develop hardware and practices that are more energy-efficient in a bid to gain a competitive advantage. The report noted that this phenomenon occurred among both marijuana growers and data center operators during high-growth periods for these industries.\n$5 Billion Annual Revenue Opportunity\nThe report predicts bitcoin mining is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to approach 350 terawatt-hours of energy consumption a year, a mark that qualifies an industry as an \u201cultra-high-end\u201d electricity consumer.\nRather, the analysts anticipate that the mining industry could present electricity producers with a $5 billion \u201cglobal annual revenue opportunity,\u201d which is a far cry from the $6 trillion worth of energy consumed globally each year.\n\u201cThis is a small portion of global electric usage and an even smaller portion of total global energy expenditures,\u201d the report concluded.\nMiners Seek Out Surplus Electricity\nMoreover, apocalyptics predictions about mining\u2019s electricity consumption ignore that the industry naturally gravitates toward locations with low utility rates, which tend to have low-cost energy due to an excess supply.\nCanadian utility Hydro-Quebec, for instance, is actively courting bitcoin miners in the wake of China\u2019s apparent desire to reduce the amount of electricity available to domestic miners.\nThis concentration of cryptocurrency mining operations in regions with surplus electricity will further mitigate the potential environmental impact of this burgeoning industry.", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

The plan will also include paying public workers in the cryptocurrency.\nNotably, Bloomberg revealed that out of the 100 million Petros Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ordered, about 38 million will go to institutional investors in a month-long presale, that\u2019s set to begin on February 15, which officials expect to bring in $1.3 billion. Then, a token sale for the general public will be held, and 44 million Petros will be sold to bring in an estimated additional $2.4 billion. The remaining 18 million Petros will go to a panel of advisers who helped the country with the token, and to the government.\nThe Petro, as previously covered by CCN, is an oil-backed cryptocurrency, meaning each token will be backed by one barrel of Venezuelan crude. Tellingly, the coins can\u2019t be exchanged for the actual oil. Each Petro is set to be divisible by 100 million units, with the minimum unit being called the mene, according to a draft proposal.\nLittle over half of the funds collected from the token sale will go to a sovereign fund, while the rest will be used to support the cryptocurrency\u2019s infrastructure and other technological projects. Venezuela will reportedly guarantee buyers the cryptocurrency will be used to pay for fees and taxes, and to conduct international business, primarily related to oil.\nThe tokens will be exchangeable for fiat currency, which will potentially help relieve the dollar shortage in the country. Per Bloomberg, the bolivar went down 3,400% against the dollar last year, while this month it went down an additional 72%. The currency is now being bypassed by even small shop owners, who are increasingly demanding payments in foreign currencies.\nAttempt to escape the recession\nVenezuela is currently crippled by one of the world\u2019s deepest recessions. It\u2019s suffering from a shortage of hard currency, and U.S. sanctions against the country cut off traditional financing options.\nThings in the country have gotten to the point Venezuelans had to use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to survive the government\u2019s failures. Per Bloomberg, the country and its state oil company are now behind on over $1.5 billion in bond payments.\nEarlier this week, Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro stated:\n\u201cImperialism intends to drown us, to follow our bank accounts and transactions, to block our oil. This is a big bet we\u2019re making for the stability and financial growth of our country.\u201d\nThe opposition-run Venezuelan congress recently outlawed Maduro\u2019s Preto as an \u201cillegal and unconstitutional\u201d instrument, as it is seen as an \u201ceffort to illegally mortgage\u201d Venezuela\u2019s oil reserves.\nThe Venezuelan Parliament\u2019s legislator, Jorge Milan, stated:\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is not a cryptocurrency, this is a forward sale of Venezuelan oil.

The financial institution was blocking the transactions while claiming cryptocurrency exchanges were transacting in non-regulated financial products. Following a backlash, the bank has seemingly backed down, and is now processing these transactions.\nSantander Totta was blocking transactions to and from popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Bitstamp and Coinbase. An employee even revealed the existence of an internal directive to block transactions using Coinbase\u2019s IBAN. This, despite Coinbase being a digital currency organization In the European Union the country\u2019s central bank, Banco de Portugal (BdP), authorizes.\nThe bank\u2019s move forced some of its clients to switch banks, while others asked consumer protection organization DECO to step in. In response, the consumer watchdog scolded the bank for its move, stating it has \u201cno known legal basis\u201d to block cryptocurrency-related transactions.\nThe backlash forced the bank to send the press an update on the situation, clarifying it hasn\u2019t adopted any measures against cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency users. The bank added that it oversees its clients\u2019 operations to ensure they comply with applicable regulations. Its update reads (roughly translated):\n\u201cBanco Santander Totta hasn\u2019t adopted any measures against cryptocurrencies or those who operate with them (\u2026) Naturally not being able to comment on the activity of its clients, Banco Santander Totta reaffirms that it follows all operations carried out within its scope, always complying with supervisory rules and legal regulations applicable to each case.\u201d\nAccording to local publication ECO, the backlash got to Santander Totta, as at least one client confirmed he was able to transfer funds to Coinbase.

Some analysts speculated that large-scale traders sold off massive amounts of bitcoin to cash out short contracts on the Cboe and CME bitcoin futures exchanges.\n\nThe theory that the sell off of whales triggering a domino effect across all major cryptocurrency exchanges and leading to a decline in the value of the cryptocurrency market is far more likely and realistic than the FUD in the Chinese and South Korean cryptocurrency markets.\nMany reports, especially by mainstream media outlets, suggested that the cryptocurrency trading ban FUD coming from the Chinese and South Korean markets led to the decline in the price of bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. \nWhile it is possible that the two markets had a small impact on the cryptocurrency market, given the insignificant trading volume of the Chinese market and the fact that the South Korean government has officially refuted cryptocurrency trading claims, it is highly unlikely that the two markets had any significant effect on the valuation of cryptocurrencies.\nAmidst extreme market volatility and periods of uncertainty, cryptocurrency traders tend to reallocate their funds to major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum for stability, because the two cryptocurrencies have demonstrated a relatively low level of volatility over the past few months. \nBoth bitcoin and Ethereum have increased by around 10 percent over the past 24 hours, with bitcoin recovering beyond $12,500 and Ethereum rebounding to $1,100.\n\nFactors of Bitcoin Price Surge in Short-Term\nCurrently, bitcoin remains as the only cryptocurrency leading financial institutions and banks are building infrastructure around. Most recently, a South Korean government official stated that the government is in consideration of allowing local financial institutions to operate bitcoin futures exchanges.\nAdditionally, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), has built a cryptocurrency price tracker for high profile institutions in the traditional finance industry and is currently awaiting for the approval of the US Securities and Exchange Comission (SEC) to list four bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US stock market.\nThe introduction of bitcoin ETFs will allow individual traders in the regulated US stock market to easily trade bitcoin with existing brokerage accounts, drastically increasing liquidity and accessibility for individual investors.\nWhile the majority of investors in the cryptocurrency market have shifted their funds from bitcoin to alternative cryptocurrencies over the past six months, as seen in the bitcoin dominance index, bitcoin still remains as the most dominant cryptocurrency or the reserve currency of the market that is stable and less volatile. \nIn the short-term, the network effect of bitcoin and the rapid increase in adoption of the cryptocurrency will likely lead the price of bitcoin to increase. As of current, bitcoin is showing better signs of recovery than it did over a week ago, and is preparing to initiate a new rally.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Bitcoin Investment Trust Sees 91-to-1 Stock Split", "url": "https://www.ccn.com/91-to-1-stock-split-of-bitcoin-investment-trust-more-retail-investors-are-coming/", "birthday": "2018-01-20T15:38:16+00:00", "date": "2018-01-20 15:38:16", "year": 2018, "month": 1, "day": 20, "content": "Bitcoin has been gaining a lot of attention in recent months as a new asset class. Study after study has shown that millennials prefer Bitcoin to traditional asset classes. All this attention, combined with a market capitalization in the hundreds of billions has left Wall Street licking their wounds as more money flows from commission-generating trades led by execs and into self-managed crypto trades run by third-party companies. Wall Street found it\u2019s solution with the launch of the Bitcoin Investment Trust in 2015. The (GBTC) Bitcoin Investment Trust is an ETF (exchange-traded fund) that buys and holds bitcoin.\u00a0\nWhy is the Stock Splitting?\nThe reason for this split is to decrease the price of an individual share to make it more accessible to retail investors. Currently, GBTC trades at around $1,800. This means newer retail investors using apps like Robinhood might not even be able to buy a single share, and if they are would use most of their portfolio to do so. In order to solve this problem a split is occurring in which every current shareholder will get 91 shares that are priced proportionally cheaper. Because this ETF represents an underlying asset the amount of Bitcoin it represents is also going to decrease. Currently, every share represents around .092 bitcoin. After the split, every share will represent around\u00a00.00101 bitcoin.\nShareholders from January 22nd on will be eligible for the split and the split will occur January 26th. As with most stock splits, one can anticipate that the increase in retail investment will lead to a price increase. Retail investors also carry with them more volatility and are much more susceptible to FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).\nWhat Does This Mean for Bitcoin?\nFirstly, it\u2019s important to recognize that GBTC\u2019s underlying asset, Bitcoin is one of the most accessible assets ever created. With easy to use \u201cexchanges\u201d like Coinbase it\u2019s time from intention to buy, to owning bitcoin is much shorter than Stocks, Gold, or other underlying assets traditionally represented by ETF\u2019s. For instance, we\u2019ve seen Coinbase growing at insane rates of 125,000 users per day. If anything is clear, it\u2019s that retail investors don\u2019t really need a cheaper way to invest in bitcoin.\nFurthermore, because GBTC is the only ETF who\u2019s underlying asset is bitcoin it trades at a high premium, over 50%. This means if you can buy a bitcoin for $10,000 on Coinbase, the share holding equivalent of a Bitcoin on GBTC will cost you $15,000. Finally, the fund comes with a 2% management fee. This is incredibly high for an unmanaged ETF and is excessive.\nNonetheless, it should be interesting to see what kind of effect the split has on the price. Despite all the reasons not to invest in the ETF over Bitcoin, will retail investors snap it up as fast as they have anything else associated with crypto? Time will tell.", "category": "Bitcoin & Blockchain Investments"}

I think that has been a big success,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Bitcoin industry has matured a lot and today Bitcoin Core gets significant regular contributions from many organizations\u2026and a volunteer community much larger and more active than it has ever been before.\u201d\nHe said that far from stepping back from Bitcoin, his resignation will allow him to spend more time focusing on development itself and less managing the day-to-day operations of a company.\n\u201cSo for me this means that I can go back to working on the things I find most exciting \u2026 without the overhead of managing staff or dealing with the many non-Bitcoin blockchain applications which are important to Blockstream\u2019s business,\u201d he said, adding that he would focus his attention on innovative technologies such as Bulletproofs, Confidential Transactions, and signature aggregation \u2014 technologies which could increase bitcoin\u2019s privacy in a more scalable way.\nMaxwell and Blockstream have both become lightning rods in the cryptocurrency community, so it is unsurprising that his resignation engendered very different responses among different corners of the ecosystem.\nPosts on the Bitcoin subreddit were overwhelmingly positive, with former coworkers praising his leadership and community members thanking him for his continued contributions to the Bitcoin development.\nThe /r/BTC subreddit \u2014 the de facto subreddit for bitcoin cash \u2014 meanwhile, attracted a few humorous conspiracy theories. One post, which had 669 upvotes at the time of writing, opined that \u201cBlockstream is falling apart.\u201d Others suggested that he had been forced out by Blockstream investors.\nPerhaps the most unique theory came from a Twitter user, however, who said that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if she learned that Maxwell had left Blockstream to begin working on Bitcoin Cash.", "category": "Bitcoin Announcements"}

Over the past month since December 2017, several national banks, including State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Yes Bank and ICICI Bank, have frozen accounts belonging to select digital currency exchanges.\nThe suspension of bank accounts appears to be primarily motivated by the banking industry\u2019s lack of faith in such businesses, especially since most exchanges have been largely operating on borrowed funds. Furthermore, of the Indian banks that haven\u2019t imposed a complete suspension on the bank accounts, most have limited the amount of money that can be withdrawn within a single day.\nAlthough Economic Times\u2019 list of affected businesses only includes Zebpay, Unocoin, CoinSecure and BtcxIndia, other exchanges have also been publicly experiencing some problems.\nA banking representative told ET that \u201c(The) Reserve Bank of India has not issued any directive to us \u2013 it\u2019s a cautionary move on our part.\u201d Financial institutions are also demanding cryptocurrency exchanges for collateral on their borrowings while keeping accounts hostage. A source familiar with the matter said,\n\u201cSince last month, banks have been asking for additional collateral with 1:1 ratio.\u201d\nMost Indian exchanges that borrowed capital from financial institutions did so in the hopes of raising an equivalent amount in private equity investment, something that has not come into fruition yet. It is likely that venture capitalists are waiting for the government to clarify the taxation and regulatory aspects of cryptocurrencies in the country.\nAn estimated eight bank accounts have been frozen so far, with more to possibly follow, according to sources quoted by The Economic Times. Banks have also reported exchanges using their bank accounts for reasons other than what was stated at the time of creating them. Financial institutions in India are mandated to disclose such suspicious transactions to the Financial Intelligence Unit.\nIt is not only the banking sector in India that has been scrutinizing the exchanges, however. The country\u2019s direct and indirect tax departments have also begun showing a\u00a0keen interest in the matter. In December 2017, the Indian Income Tax department conducted audits at a number of cryptocurrency exchanges throughout the country. A few days later, it announced that it had sent notices to high net-worth individuals that previously transacted large amounts of cryptocurrency. According to the same department, the cumulative revenue of the top 10 Indian exchanges is in the ballpark of $6 billion.\nZebpay and Koinex, responsible for most of India\u2019s digital currency trading volume and the most popular options among new investors, have both released several statements following the suspension of some of their bank accounts in the past few weeks. While Zebpay did not stop processing withdrawals in this time frame, it did have some hiccups with deposits as evidenced by a support webpage. Koinex suspended all fiat transactions, including deposits, for around a week, before re-enabling the option on January 8, 2018.\nDue to this increased scrutiny by lawmakers and financial bodies, the past month has been particularly troublesome for Indian exchanges. The situation is likely to worsen as the cryptocurrency market continues to intrigue the country\u2019s population and gain traction among first-time investors.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

Based on the recent fall in the markets during the week of January 15th, it seems that \u201cyes\u201d is the answer to that question.\nDuring the market slump last week, there was some banter on Reddit that the crash was going to end Wednesday, January 17 at 4:00 PM EST when the markets closed the first Bitcoin futures contracts on the CBOE expired at $10,900 per Bitcoin. There was even a countdown\u00a0posted by one Reddit user. While the price of Bitcoin did not rocket back up in the immediate aftermath, altcoins started to rebound hours after the futures contracts expired.\nFutures Strategy \nMany institutional investors are wise to use the futures contracts to lower the Bitcoin price to buy in lower by setting the stop-loss triggers at support levels to push down the price further and further to make it look like a crash. This scares novice investors to support the bears and sell to avoid a total loss. By taking this strategy, the Wall Street investors are strategically pushing down the price for in order to re-enter at much lower levels and potentially set Bitcoin up for another rocket rise to unprecedented highs. Then, assumingly, collect profits and repeat the cycle, increasing profits each time Bitcoin rises and falls.\nUnited: We All Fall and Rise Together\nInterestingly, the cryptocurrency market seems to rise and fall simultaneously with the altcoins. Is a systemic issue that causes this harmonious rise and fall of prices on the exchanges? The answer is a little fuzzy, but there are several factors at play. Most exchanges use Bitcoin as the universal trading currency, which leads to many investors buying and selling Bitcoin to buy and sell altcoins. When bitcoin starts a bull run, many of the altcoins fall, as investors jump on the Bitcoin train and vice versa. It\u2019s also systemic because most exchanges require Bitcoin rather than fiat currency to transact. It is easy to invest fiat currency in the market and then leave there as an investor trades it; moving it from one currency to another and not cashing it back to fiat currency. Furthermore, When the Bitcoin price falls or rises against the fiat currency, all the altcoins will usually follow. This is because all altcoin prices are based on their Bitcoin exchange rate, not their fiat currency exchange rate. The value of an altcoin in fiat currency is the value of the altcoin in Bitcoin and then Bitcoin\u2019s value in that fiat currency. It is Bitcoin that strongly affects pricing.\nWith much of the market tied into Bitcoin, it makes it easy for the Bitcoin Futures contracts to manipulate the entire cryptocurrency market because it is not just the value of the altcoins is the value of the altcoins in relation to the value of bitcoin.\nThe next litmus test is coming this Friday, January 26th when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures contracts on Bitcoin are set to expire. Given that the cryptocurrency market is recovering, it is likely that the contracts could continue the bull run or not.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

But, based on the statement of Korbit, foreigners will be able to trade until January 31 and by the end of this month, overseas investors will no longer be able to deposit Korean won on South Korean cryptocurrency trading platforms.\nStrict Regulations Rather Than a Ban\nLast week, the South Korean government and the executive office of President Moon Jae-in officially stated that a cryptocurrency trading ban will not be imposed in the short-term. Rather than a ban, the government emphasized that strict regulations will be imposed to ensure the local cryptocurrency exchange market remains stable and regulated for general consumers.\nFollowing the statement of the government, South Korea\u2019s Fair Trade Commission chairman Kim Sang-jo said that closing down cryptocurrency exchanges is realistically impossible, considering the immense economic impact it would bring.\nThe statement of chairman Kim translated at CCN read:\n\u201c[Shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges] is not realistically possible. Based on electronic commerce law, the government does not have the authority to close down cryptocurrency trading platforms.\nFrom the viewpoint of an economist, it is not a fair and transparent decision to outright ban economic activity. Whether it is excessive speculation or not, the gain or the loss is the responsibility of the investor.\u201d\nAs of current, it remains unclear whether foreigners will be prohibited from trading cryptocurrencies in the local market in the long run.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

The entity\u2019s statement didn\u2019t specify the type of false information, nor did it name any specific media group publishing it.\nLikely, it was referring to a Reddit post from about two weeks ago, that claimed Petro could be an ERC-20 token. The post reportedly found Petro\u2019s whitepaper, a document the Venezuelan government hasn\u2019t confirmed or denied being authentic, but that is seemingly hosted on the government\u2019s official website.\nThe whitepaper itself seems to be authentic.

About 38 million Petros will be sold to institutional investors in a month-long presale that\u2019s set to begin on February 15, and should bring in $1.3 billion. Per Reuters, institutional investors will be offered a discount of up to 60 percent on the token.\nThen, a public token sale will be held, in which 44 million tokens will be sold. Officials expect this phase of the sale to bring in $2.4 billion. The remaining 18 million tokens will go to a panel of advisers that supported the government an aided in the creation of the cryptocurrency, and to the government itself.\nAs previously covered by CCN, the opposition-run Venezuelan congress recently outlawed the cryptocurrency, as an \u201cillegal and unconstitutional\u201d instrument.

The statement sent by Korbit to its users read:\n\u201cAs previously announced, in order to comply with the identification and anti-money laundering regulations being enforced by the government, the current KRW deposit method will be terminated by the end of January 2018.\nTo use the new KRW deposit method, which is slated to be implemented within this month, you must have a Shinhan Bank account registered under your legal name. Please use this time to create a banking account at Shinhan Bank. We will follow up with further instructions on how to input the new KRW withdrawal account information on Korbit.\u201d\nWith the recent announcement of Korbit, traders have become relieved and started not to fear about the possibility of a cryptocurrency trading ban. Previously, in an official document, the South Korean government stated that it had requested financial institutions and banks within the regulated finance industry to prevent providing banking services to cryptocurrency exchanges. \nWhat Will Happen to South Korean Cryptocurrency Market?\nThis week, several local media outlets reported that a high ranking financial authority in South Korea claimed the government is planning to allow financial institutions to list bitcoin futures, as the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) did in 2017. \nThe government official explained that the listing of bitcoin futures would stabilize the market and enable the bitcoin exchange market to mature, reducing premiums and excessive speculation by local investors.\nIn the upcoming months, the South Korean government will likely roll out practical regulations to protect both investors and businesses. In a statement released in December, a member of the cryptocurrency regulation task force noted that the government will follow the regulatory roadmap established by leading markets like Japan and the US.\nGiven the current state of the market and the government\u2019s decision to not impose a trading ban in the short-term, the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market has been fairly optimistic over the past few days, as shown by the rising price and volumes of cryptocurrencies in both the South Korean and global market.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Specifically, away from cryptocurrency miners.\nAccording to ComputerBase, Nvidia\u2019s spokesperson\u00a0Boris B\u00f6hles stated that gamers will always be their priority, \u201cFor NVIDIA, gamers come first. All activities related to our GeForce product line are focused on our main audience. To ensure that GeForce gamers continue to have good GeForce graphics card availability in the current situation, we recommend that our trading partners make the appropriate arrangements to meet gamers\u2019 needs as usual.\u201d\nIn advising retailers to control their sales, Nvidia is looking for ways to bring down the price of the graphics cards. From April, 2017 until this month, TechSpot reported a 27% price increase in GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, 86% in GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, 89% in GeForce GTX 1060 6GB, and a 59% increase in the famous GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. Customers are buying the cards in bulk, causing price inflation as well as a scarcity of the products. Nvidia also suggested that only two graphics cards be sold per customer to avoid any further increase in sales.\nCryptocurrency mining is on the rise, with Bitcoin miners using as much as 36 terawatt hours of energy in 2017. However, this wasn\u2019t the case when Bitcoin was originally launched. Miners could use two or three PCs and CPUs with ease. But the complexity of generating BTC increased over time, and so miners began looking for more computing power. Interestingly, TechRadar listed Nvidia\u2019s GeForce GTX 1070 as the best graphics card for mining. With a higher hashing rate and low power consumption, crypto miners overlooked the high price of the product for its long-term use. In fact, Nvidia\u2019s graphics cards took three positions on the aforementioned list.\nNvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang talked about cryptocurrencies and their future last year, \u201cCrypto is here to stay, and the market will grow to be quite large. It\u2019s not likely to go away anytime soon. There will be more currencies to come, they will come from different nations\u2026We stay very close to the market, and understand the dynamics very well.\u201d\nHuang even mentioned that Nvidia has\u00a0 \u201ca special coin-mining SKU [that is] optimized for mining,\u201d which led people to believe that the company would be launching cryptocurrency GPUs. However, the recent announcement proves that Nvidia won\u2019t be moving to the crypto market just yet.\nWhile other companies would use this situation to reap more financial benefits, Nvidia chooses to focus on satisfying its gaming community.", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

Since a major correction occured last week, the market cap of Ripple has struggled to recover beyond $80 billion.\nAt its peak, Ripple\u2019s market valuation neared $150 billion, easily surpassing Ethereum to become the second largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin. However, since the correction, Ripple has endured a week-long slump.\n\nCardano, which peaked at $32 billion on January 3, has failed to rebound over $20 billion over the past week, struggling to achieve half of the market valuation of Bitcoin Cash. \nSeveral analysts have attributed the recent minor correction of the cryptocurrency market to the South Korean cryptocurrency market, and the decision of major cryptocurrency exchanges to prohibit foreigners from trading cryptocurrencies.\nThis week, as CCN previously reported, South Korea\u2019s third largest cryptocurrency exchange Korbit told its users that foreigners will no longer be able to deposit or withdraw Korean won on local cryptocurrency exchanges once a new anti-money laundering (AML) system is integrated by the end of January. The Korbit team wrote:\n\u201cPlease note, however, that non-Korean nationals, both resident and non-resident, will not be allowed to deposit KRW at any domestic cryptocurrency exchanges when the new KRW deposit method is implemented. We will explain further via a separate message. In order to comply with the identification and anti-money laundering regulations being enforced by the government, the current KRW deposit method will be terminated by the end of January 2018.\u201d\nIt is difficult to measure the impact of the foreigner cryptocurrency trading ban initiated by the South Korean government on the global cryptocurrency market given that the majority of cryptocurrency investors and traders in the South Korean market are the country\u2019s citizens. \nThus, it is far-fetched to claim that the prohibition of foreigners from trading cryptocurrencies in the local market caused the global cryptocurrency market to experience a minor correction. More to that, the government has stated since December 14 of last year that foreigners will not be able to trade cryptocurrencies in the local market.\nWhat Happens to the Market?\nCurrently, the South Korean cryptocurrency market has disabled local investors from opening new accounts. Only investors that have opened accounts prior to January 2018 are able to trade. By the end of January, cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea will begin accepting new users and opening accounts for investors. \nIt is likely that by the end of this month, within the next two weeks, a wave of investors from the traditional finance market will invest in the local cryptocurrency exchange market, causing volumes to spike and the value of cryptocurrencies to increase.\nIn the short-term, within the next few days, the cryptocurrency market could continue to slump considering that historically, cryptocurrencies have tended to perform poorly in the beginning of the year, due to the Chinese new year. \nDuring the Chinese new year celebrated by China and South Korea, the majority of people in the two countries send money overseas or domestically, withdrawing money from their bank accounts and cryptocurrency holdings.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

When these passengers departed for the high seas for the Second Annual Blockchain Cruise, on Jan. 15, the bitcoin price was trading in the $13,500 range, with their profits intact. But by the time they docked in Thailand on Jan. 17, the bitcoin price had sunk to the $10,000 level, slashing the net worth of the successful bitcoin investors in the interim, a group of 600 reportedly comprised of mostly young men.\nBloomberg\u2019s Blake Schmidt was on the ship, and he documented as well as\u00a0tweeted about the experience of what he described as an \u201cextravaganza,\u201d one that seemingly had the makings of a James Bond movie with drones flying overhead to capture the festivities on camera. While bitcoin was a hot topic of discussion, passengers also explored the life-changing potential for blockchain technology in key sectors including healthcare.\nThey had embarked on a five-day cruise via the Strait of Malacca, ironically enough in the surrounding region of the latest regulatory scrutiny out of Asia. The trip was filled with high-profile speakers\u00a0and events\u00a0as well as sun and fun to immerse themselves in all things blockchain and crypto, as the run-up in bitcoin and other altcoins put many of them in a higher tax bracket last year.\u00a0Apparently,\u00a0it takes more than a 20% drop in the bitcoin price in a single session to get these guys seasick, not to mention a 50% drop from the December high. In fact, the timing of the trip gave them the opportunity to discuss the shifting sands in the bitcoin price among peers, with some providing perspective on the selloff.\n\u201cNothing goes up in a straight line,\u201d assured Ronnie Moas, who is behind Miami\u2019s Standpoint Research and was among the featured speakers on the cruise including a session about income inequality, in\u00a0which he reportedly\u00a0challenged the\u00a0new\u00a0bitcoin-millionaires to use their wealth to make an impact on society. He also gave the closing keynote. Looking at the glass half-full, Moas predicts that if all the stars align, bitcoin could be trading as high as $300,000 by 2025.\nJohn McAfee, the antivirus-software veteran turned bitcoin miner, headlined a session about \u201cemerging cryptocurrencies\u201d and their influence on businesses and bitcoin. The selloff, according to McAfee, was driven by skittish investors baselessly anticipating\u00a0the other regulatory shoe to drop. You can\u2019t blame them after a week filled with chatter, such as South Korea possibly taking a page from China\u2019s book by cracking down on cryptocurrency exchanges, for instance.\nBut there is a difference between most people vis-\u00e0-vis those with crypto fever. The cruisers are in it for the long-haul and are prepared not only for the choppy waters that they encounter along the way but also a future of smooth sailing in which blockchain technology and bitcoin are natural as the air we breathe.\nAmong the passengers on the blockchain cruise were founders of blockchain-based businesses looking to pursue fundraising via an upcoming ICO, including one alternative power bitcoin-mining startup, as well as a former Aussie coal-miner who was able to retire amid his cryptocurrency-driven fortunes.", "category": "Bitcoin & Blockchain Investments"}

Though India is not a major economic center for cryptocurrency trading, the country accounts for an estimated 10 percent of all bitcoin transactions. Consequently, the news is likely a factor in the recent price decline.\nFinally, US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton said earlier this week that he has instructed SEC staff to be on \u201chigh alert\u201d for initial coin offerings (ICOs) that violate securities laws, perhaps hinting that the agency is preparing to step up its intervention in the nascent ICO fundraising industry.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

African central banks have consistently\u00a0followed policies that have eroded the purchasing power of their citizen\u2019s money. \u00a0As a result, bitcoin will offer Africans a choice and another option for money as a store of value.\nBitcoin has been portrayed by many as a medium of exchange for illegal and unground activities. Less attention has been devoted to the use of bitcoin as a way for people to circumvent disastrous, governmental policies that are so common around the world. \u00a0We know bitcoin demand has been strong in Venezuela and Zimbabwe. \u00a0How have the most populous African countries managed their fiat money stock?\u00a0\nFiat currency, or money that has value by government decree, has been created out of thin air by central banks around the world. \u00a0For the most part, rich western democracies have done an OK job of managing monetary policy. \u00a0Remember, the two most important goals of a central bank are stable prices and economic growth. \u00a0\nThat\u2019s not to say the Fed has been perfect. \u00a0There is tons of academic literature that argues Fed policy pushed a normal recession into the Great Depression. In addition, Easy Al\u2019s policies can be blamed for artificially low-interest rates in 90\u2019s which created the housing bubble and the Great Recession. \u00a0Furthermore, Austrian Business Cycle Theory is devoted to explaining that wild swings in the business cycle are caused by central bank mismanagement of the money supply. This creates a perverse interest rate price, which leads to malinvestment and misallocation. Analyzation and critique of the Fed is a different article.\nThis article will look at the 4 most populous African countries and examine how they have managed monetary policy. \u00a0We will look at inflation rates for these countries and assess how the monetary authorities have fared with the intended goal of stable prices.\nInflation\nThe Federal Reserve has targeted an inflation rate of 2%. \u00a0They feel that 2% is perfect for stable prices and economic growth. \u00a0The consequences of high inflation are many. \u00a0High inflation eats into people\u2019s savings and makes it difficult to plan and invest. \u00a0It makes long-term financial decisions impossible and high, persistent inflation leads to a shrinking production possibility frontier. This amplifies the burden of scarcity. \u00a0With less planning and investment, there is less capital stock. \u00a0Less capital stock in the hands of workers leads to less productivity and more poverty. \nThe following graphs illustrate recent inflation rates in the 4 most populous countries of Africa. Once again, 2% is the goal here. \u00a0The first graph is for the United States. \u00a0Nigeria, Egypt, Ethiopia and The Republic of Congo are the others.\n\n\n\n\nMonetary Mismanagement\nNigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Congo have all been a monetary disaster in the last year. \u00a0Congo\u2019s inflation rate has hit around 70 percent. \u00a0Egypt\u2019s is in the 30\u2019s. \u00a0Nigeria is in the high teens and Ethiopia is in double digits. \u00a0The four most populous African countries\u2019 monetary policies have been a financial catastrophe. \u00a0\nThe people have been let down in these four countries by their financial authorities. Milton Friedman essentially won a Nobel prize proving that sustained inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. \u00a0In the end, it\u2019s always too many dollars chasing too few goods. \u00a0Increased monetary growth increases prices but doesn\u2019t increase real output. \u00a0Increasing the money supply does nothing in the fight against scarcity. \u00a0Friedman argued that inflation is always and everywhere a governmental failure.\nThere is lots of economic writing on why governments would be this bad with their money. \u00a0\u00a0Many governments have not separated the regime in power from the central bank. \u00a0They have used the fiat printing press as a personal bank account. \u00a0Regimes have also used expansionary monetary policy to get incumbents elected in elections. \u00a0In addition, governments have monetized their debt and spent newly printed fiat on earmarks to attract voters and allies. \nMarket-Based Solution\nThe population of these four countries is approximately 450 million people. \u00a0\u00a0These citizens are having their savings eaten alive almost daily. \u00a0They can\u2019t plan, save and invest in their futures. Bitcoin offers a hope to these people. \u00a0One does not need a bank account, an ID, or a national social security number to use bitcoin. Bitcoin will continue to take market share from regional fiat currencies for use as a store of value. People are tired of watching their purchasing power vanish due to inflation. \u00a0These four countries alone produced over 800 billion dollars of GDP per year. Bitcoins market cap today is around 300 billion. \u00a0\nBitcoin still fluctuates wildly but as more participants enter, the volatility will smooth out. \u00a0The market is smart and disciplined. Prices will ultimately reflect the collective knowledge and groupthink of millions of people. \u00a0\u00a0Essentially, it comes down to the same debate that a lot of macroeconomics is about. \u00a0Who is better at allocating? The collective analysis of millions of market participants or a few government officials, lobbyist and bureaucrats? \u00a0I side with the market and I think Africans will eventually as well.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

The utility token is based on the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s ERC-20 standard and will be capped at 500 million tokens. \u2018Huobi Token, short for \u201cHT\u201d, is a token system based on Blockchain launching and management,\u2019 Huobi explained in a post on its website.\nDetails from the announcement reveal 300 million (60%) HT will be available for sale to investors, over a 15-day period. A further 100 million tokens (20%) will be used for platform operations and user rewards whereas the remaining 100 million tokens will be reserved for team incentives.\nIn a related press release, the exchange insisted that the offering isn\u2019t an ICO open to all investors. The 300 million HT will instead be offered only to users purchasing a \u2018Point Package\u2019, essentially a pre-paid card package on its Huobi Pro platform using the dollar-pegged tether token (USDT).\nAn excerpt from the announcement read:\nHT is not an initial coin offering (ICO). Users can only get HT by purchasing \u2018Point Card\u2019 on Huobi Pro. Point Card is Huobi\u2019s pre-paid card for basic service charge. 1 point = 1 USDT.\nHuobi Tokens, which will presumably serve as an asset for exchange at Huobi\u2019s several exchanges globally, will be available for trading with tether, bitcoin and ethereum from February 1.\nFurthermore, Huobi also insists that it will buy back Huobi Tokens from the open market with 20% of its net income, putting a \u2018certain proportion\u2019 of the tokens to the Huobi Investor Protection Fund, a reserve to compensate and safeguard investors against market volatility and losses.\nHuobi was among China\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency trading platforms prior to crippling domestic regulations that effectively curtailed the industry. After closing its Chinese trading platform in October, Huobi founder Leon Li summed up China\u2019s curtain call as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the industry before launching Huobi Pro, its international trading platform headquartered in Singapore.\nHuobi\u2019s announcement to offer its own token is yet another step in the former Chinese exchange giant\u2019s diversification strategy, which includes an expansion into major cryptocurrency markets in South Korea and Japan.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

These exchanges serve as platforms where tokens and digital assets can be traded across each other and also across fiat currencies. Hence, they represent a crucial aspect of the industry in determining the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology.\nThe impact of being listed\nAs new cryptos emerge, either as a result of brand new innovations or blockchain protocol modification (forks), their growth and sustainability depend largely on the level of demand by the community. This explains why it is such a big deal whenever new tokens are listed on any major exchange. It makes them more available and open for effective trading for members of the crypto community.\nIn a recent post, US-based digital asset exchange, GDAX announced that it will open its BCH-BTC Order Book on Wednesday, January 17 at 9:00 am PST. This announcement came after an initial show of support for Bitcoin Cash by the exchange some weeks before the time of writing. During its previous attempt, GDAX experienced some setback after BCH trading was halted on the platform. The halt is suspected to be as a result of ongoing\u00a0investigation into how some people manage to manipulate orders across the exchange.\nThe unique life of Bitcoin Cash\nThe typical trend when such events occur is a significant increase in value of any newly enlisted token on a major exchange. Having faced a rather controversial existence, especially during the hard fork which brought BCH into existence, the cryptocurrency has towed its own peculiar growth pattern. In its initial growth stages, we saw BCH move in the opposite direction with Bitcoin price action like a direct competitor, however, recently a more synchronized price movement pattern is observed. Overall, BCH short-term price movements have been a dicey one to call, hence the community\u2019s expectation with this anticipated listing is not yet clear.\nRoger Ver, one of the earliest investors in Bitcoin(BTC), who now appears to be the face Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash(BCH) remains unperturbed with the temporary events surrounding the cryptocurrency.\u00a0 Ver insists that BCH will continue in its steady growth and eventually surpass BTC in the near future.\nVer tells CCN:\n\u201cBCH is the same version of Bitcoin that everyone fell in love with and used from 2009 until 2017. It has the same economic code that led to it becoming a world wide phenomenon. I\u2019m sure that formula will continue to work for BCH into the future, and it will surpass BTC in usage, popularity, and market cap in the near future.\u201d\nSome of the responses that followed the announcement by GDAX on twitter reveals mixed expectations from members of the community. While some think that the crypto has already found market stability and may not be affected much by any major listing, others still believe that going live on GDAX is a big deal.\nLess volatility, more adoption\nAs the entire trading volume and capitalization of the cryptocurrency market improves, the level of volatility is expected to reduce. Even though it may reduce the profit opportunities for speculators who take advantage of the huge swings in price, increased stability attract more mainstream application of cryptocurrencies. Cryptos will find more regular application as elements of transaction that will become significantly adopted for eventual organic application.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

Although he did not give a specific time-frame of when Bitcoin will surpass $100,000, he pointed to some historical facts and related data to support his claim. He pointed that Ethereum was trading at around $245 around September but is now trading at around $957 at the time of writing.\nWhile the biggest coins continue to lose value, Eran insists that the price drops are due to the China and South Korea\u2019s crackdown on cryptocurrencies. South Korea\u2019s justice ministry is proposing a ban on cryptocurrency trading. The Chinese government is targeting to censor and shut down all online platforms that facilitate trading. This is bad for the cryptocurrency industry because South Korea is the largest cryptocurrency trading market barring the U.S. and Japan.\nEran further says, \u201cIn the United States, the Bitcoin exchanges were shut down three times.\u201d On its own, this is a sign that Bitcoin always finds a way to survive events that result in major price drops. The cryptocurrency market is a very young market with a with an upward trend. Elan is convinced that Bitcoin is not going to crash but will stabilize and gain momentum when the crackdown stops. He attributes the crackdown to governments trying to mitigate the ramifications of cryptocurrency trading.\nElan calls Bitcoin \u201ca store of value,\u201d just like gold is. He also points out that Ethereum is different. Ethereum is a platform used to build apps and other cryptocurrencies. He says that Ethereum\u2019s value is dependant on the use of the cryptocurrencies that are built on it. Each coin\u2019s value is derived from its utility. This gives cryptocurrencies an economic value within their sectors of utilization.\nMarket Fluctuations Do Not Mean a Crash\nFluctuations are natural in the young industry. They are not an indication of a market crash. In a way, the future of cryptocurrencies is bound to that of Bitcoin. The prediction that Bitcoin\u2019s price will go high above $100,000 is an indication of a bright future. This upward trend should also be observed in the majority of other alternative coins. The crackdown of cryptocurrencies in South Korea and China will come to an end soon.\nThe fluctuations and price drops are only an indication of what is happening at the present moment. They have no bearing on the future prices of Bitcoin and altcoins. The cryptocurrency market is not headed for a crash. In time, the price of cryptocurrencies will start to show an upward increase and Bitcoin will make it past the $100,000 mark.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

Litecoin, Dash, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold among others have all found existence with each of them claiming peculiar improvements from Bitcoin.\nIn its present state, the Bitcoin blockchain is faced with a number of weaknesses that has attracted huge criticism to the front-runner and most popular blockchain in existence. This is not a surprise since even Satoshi himself from the onset made it clear that he was open to discussions upon his idea.The inherent weaknesses identified have led to several predictions by opposing groups of the possible dethronement of Bitcoin as the N01 cryptocurrency.\nSpeed\nThe speed with which transactions are confirmed nowadays on the Bitcoin blockchain is a far cry from what it used to be even two years ago. Delayed transactions have become a common scenario on the Bitcoin blockchain which leaves users frustrated most often. This development is regarded as the major reason why the cryptocurrency isn\u2019t suitable for transaction purposes, coupled with its high rate of volatility. Apparently, to encourage mainstream adoption, the value at the time of execution of a transaction should not vary from the time of receipt. This is hardly the case nowadays as Bitcoin transactions take several hours, and sometimes days before being confirmed. Several arguments have arisen as a result of this weakness and innovations such as SegWit and even the eventual hardfork which gave rise to Bitcoin Cash have all been based on the efficiency of the network.\nCost of transaction\nTransaction fees have become a scare in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The fees are often so high sometimes that they can be termed ridiculous. Technically, Bitcoin transaction fees are determined based on the number of transactions and the size in kilobytes of each transaction. These fees however do not go to any central authority, but rather to the miners as rewards for transaction confirmation. Therefore, transactions with higher inputs will require more work, so during times of increased market volatility, as is mostly the case nowadays, miners become attracted to transactions with less inputs. This implies less work for them, hence transactions with higher number of inputs (which are usually more popular) will need to pay higher fees in order to appear attractive to the miners.\nThese fees most often negate the assumption of peer-to-peer transactions as a cheaper method of remittance.\nQuasi-centralization\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is a decentralized platform, at least by design. However, the recent configuration of the ecosystem sees majority of the mining powers resting in the hand of a few individuals. As a community that is governed by consensus, this implies that these few miners who control most of the hashing power will always call the shots. Many argue that this gives the community an outlook of a centralized system and as such, functions like that.\nAnother hardfork \u2013 Bitcoin Atom\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is about to experience another hardfork by an anonymous team that claim to uphold the original principles of Satoshi Nakamoto as they create Bitcoin Atom (BCA).\nAccording to the leader of the team who chooses to remain anonymous, in bringing a solution to the dual problem of speed and cost, the protocol will run both on-chain and off-chain mechanisms, (i.e lightening and atomic swaps). He notes that even though centralization is a less obvious weakness for Bitcoin, the risks posed by exchanges upon which the cryptocurrency is usually transacted is enough concern for the industry.\n\u201cCentralization is less obvious but the problem with main transfer of value in crypto world is exchanges. Centralized exchanges can be hacked or disappear or shut down by the regulators, and decentralized exchanges such as Etherdelta don\u2019t trade bitcoin and only trade ERC-20 tokens. Even at that, they can get hacked\u201d, He says.\nThe Bitcoin Atom team claim to include exchange functionalities also at the protocol level on the nodes of Bitcoin itself, thus nobody can control the exchange but the system itself.\nThis protocol, however, will combine both proof of work and proof of stake that will be based on the old Bitcoin codebase, unlike similar implementations before it.\nThe fork is expected to happen between January 24th and 25th 2018 at Block 505 888.", "category": "Bitcoin Technology"}

A year ago the same transaction would have cost you well under $1.\n\nAdd that to the fact the average confirmation time on the blockchain is now well over 11,400 minutes thanks to the market crashing to start the new year and it\u2019s easy to see why users are quite turned off of BTC.\nAs governments continue to regulate exchanges, and developers aim to come up with the next new Bitcoin-killing altcoin to hit the market, it\u2019s obvious that the community is dying for a solution to slow transaction times and sky-high transaction fees.\nIt\u2019s also obvious that Bitcoin.org still has a few updates to make on its website.", "category": "News"}

But bitcoin does not provide any of these key advantages. Quite the contrary,\u201d Goldman wrote.\nIn what has become a well-worn critique, the note compared the present state of the cryptocurrency markets to the so-called \u201ctulip bubble\u201d in 17th-century Holland, adding that bitcoin has already \u201cdwarfed\u201d tulipmania and other historic asset bubbles.\nSource: Goldman Sachs Investment Strategy Group\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the rise in bitcoin\u2019s price has pushed it into bubble territory,\u201d the note said, \u201ccryptocurrencies have moved beyond bubble levels in financial markets.\u201d\n\u2018[O]ur descendants doubtless will laugh at the human insanity of our Age, that in our times, the tulip flowers have been so revered,\u2019\u201d Goldman concluded, quoting a Dutch historian writing a decade after tulip prices collapsed.\nBitcoin Bubble Won\u2019t Affect Equities\nHowever, diverging from a recent Wells Fargo analysis, Goldman said that it did not believe a cryptocurrency market crash would spill over into traditional equities \u2014 at least at the market\u2019s present level.\n\u201cWe should also add that we do not believe a collapse in bitcoin will have major contagion effects on the global economy or financial markets,\u201d Goldman wrote. \u201cAt the peak of the dot-com bubble in March 2000, the combined market capitalization of Nasdaq and S&P 500 information technology stocks was 101% of US GDP and 31% of world GDP.

Speaking on behalf of the IMF, spokesman Gerry Rice weighed in on the benefits of cryptocurrencies in their use as payments as well as their abuse in money laundering, fraud and terrorist financing.\nSpeaking to reporters in Washington, Rice added in quotes reported by Bloomberg:\n\u201cWhen asset prices go up quickly, risks can accumulate, particularly if market participants are borrowing money to buy. It\u2019s important for people to be aware of the risks and take the necessary risk-management measures.\u201d\nRice did not delve into specifics of the kind of collaboration or policies that the IMF is pushing for. The organization, which was established near the end of the second World War to reconstruct the international monetary and payments system, now functions as a fund that bails out countries embroiled in economic crises.\nAs a traditional financial heavyweight that continues to wield influence, the IMF has been known to taking a nuanced approach when discussing cryptocurrencies, particularly in their utility as an instrument for financial inclusion in developing or under-developed countries.\nNearly a year ago to the day, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde presented a report titled \u201cVirtual Currencies and Beyond: Initial Considerations\u201d at the World Economic Forum.

Now that tax season is upon us, investors of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may be filing their crypto-generated income for the first time ever.\u00a0Meanwhile, given the private nature of bitcoin, not to mention an opaque regulatory framework surrounding cryptocurrencies, investors may think that their gains can\u2019t be tracked or that the tax requirement is obscure. The reality is the IRS wants its cut, and investors are responsible for reporting it on their tax returns.\nBefore investors can report their\u00a0bitcoin income, they should know how it\u2019s treated. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are taxed as property, which places them in a similar camp to how equities and bonds are taxed. And while the IRS hasn\u2019t updated its cryptocurrency guidelines since 2014, investors are still expected to report their crypto-gotten gains (or losses, if they placed a bet on Tezos, for instance) when they file.\nNo Russian Roulette\nAn accountant with knowledge of cryptocurrencies is quoted in The New York Times as saying: \u201cIf you play audit roulette, you are a fool. If you made a single trade or more, report it.\u201d For instance, if you sold any bitcoin, apart from kicking yourself, you are subject to a capital gains rate that is determined by how long you held the asset \u2014 anything more than a year puts you in the 0-20% range, while a shorter-term returns are taxed as ordinary income.\u00a0 You can apply any losses to offset capital gains, as an option.\nEven though the IRS doesn\u2019t treat bitcoin or other digital coins as currency, consumers can still choose to spend them as such.\u00a0While 40% of American cryptocurrency investors choose to\u00a0hoard their bitcoin, more than half intend to spend it to make a purchase in the physical world this year.\nBitcoin is increasingly being accepted at e-commerce sites, restaurants, retail chains, schools, airlines, city governments, travel booking operators and more.\u00a0A\u00a0consumer who got in on bitcoin at $1,000 and purchased a vehicle when the cryptocurrency reached nearly $20,000 would have to report a capital gain of approximately $19,000, for example. Even bitcoin miners must report their earnings as gross income, attaching fair market value reflecting the time they received the reward.\nThe IRS considers any wages earned, whether paid in fiat money or cryptocurrency, as taxable both for full-time employees and freelancers.\nSomething to keep in mind. San Francisco-based Coinbase, the biggest US digital currency exchange, at the behest of a California court was required to provide the IRS with records of thousands of cryptocurrency investors who traded $20,000-plus in digital coins in the two-year period leading up to 2015.

Because bitcoin and Ethereum have significantly larger market valuations and daily trading volumes in comparison to other cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and Ethereum tend to decline or increase by smaller margins, showing a lower level of volatility.\n\nEver since the cryptocurrency market experienced a major correction in early January, the market has struggled to recover back to their previous all-time highs (ATHs). Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ripple are all down around 50 percent from their ATHs, while Ethereum has somewhat recovered to $1,000.\nOver the past 12 months, the cryptocurrency market has barely had any major long-lasting corrections. Ethereum and Ripple surged by 130-fold and 330-fold each within one year and during that period, most cryptocurrencies in the market also increased by large margins.\nFor long-term growth, it is positive that the cryptocurrency market has experienced a week-long correction as it would allow the global market to stabilize and solidify, shaking off speculators and weak hands. However, if the daily trading volume of the global cryptocurrency market continues to decrease, in the short-term, the cryptocurrency market could struggle to recover from the recent correction.\nOver the past seven days, the daily trading volume of the global cryptocurrency market declined from $35 billion to $27 billion, as South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges Upbit and Bithumb overtook Binance and Bittrex to become the largest exchanges in the market.\nUpbit is operated by KakaoTalk operator Kakao\u2019s subsidiary company Dunamu, which is the most widely utilized stocks trading platform in the local market. Because of its connection with Kakao, Upbit users can deposit or withdraw payments using KakaoPay, the most popular fintech application in South Korea. As such, due to the dominance of KakaoPay in the South Korean fintech market and Upbit\u2019s connection to Kakao, the user base of Upbit has increase rapidly.\nIncreasing Adoption\nThis week, it was reported that 1 out of 10 bitcoin transactions is being processed in India and more than half of Russians are aware of bitcoin. The adoption of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum is rising rapidly in major economies with unclear regulations and policies. Hence, if the Indian and Russian government regulate their respective cryptocurrency markets in 2018, it is likely that the cryptocurrency market will surge in terms of daily trading volume and value. \nAnatoly Aksakov, the chairman of the State Duma\u2019s financial markets committee in Russia, stated that he expects cryptocurrency regulations to be introduced in March. Regulating a massive cryptocurrency market like Russia is an optimistic sign for the mid-term growth of cryptocurrencies.\n\u201cI expect that the adoption of the draft law on [cryptocurrencies] will be in March\u2026 The problem is that we already have a lot of people who acquire [cryptocurrencies] and they are deceived, we need to give people the opportunity to work legally with it, to protect them as much as possible,\u201d said Aksakov.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

This began in the early hours of Tuesday, January 16 and continued for the most part of the week with a few rebounds here and there. This fall in price saw Bitcoin drop in price by about 15% in the initial stages, make a rebound and fall even further, while some altcoins have shed about 90% of their original value in price before the swoon.\nThe Asian impact\nThis is not the first time that cryptocurrencies are responding in such a manner especially after some resistive measures by governments. This time around, the popular narrative is that this market behaviour is as a result of the most recent regulatory pressure from China and South Korea.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, an announcement by the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) indicating plans to regulate the cryptocurrency operations within China gave rise to a similar situation. However, that fall in price was short-lived as Bitcoin especially recovered fully and even set new price records in just a few days. This same pattern was repeated a couple of times throughout 2017, especially as a couple of countries in the Asian continent came out with various announcements on actions or intentions towards the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nThe impact that these Asian nations are having on the crypto industry is related to the high level of participation that the industry receives from that region.\nAn opportunity for long-term traders\nThe CEO of Netcoins, Michael Vogel tells CCN that this is borne out of the fact that these Asian countries have been among the earliest adopters of cryptocurrency, and this is often why negative news in Asia (or perceived negative news) can cause panic selling in other parts of the world.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this many times, however, it is important to remember the irony though; Bitcoin hit all-time high price months after China first proclaimed its reluctance to embrace Bitcoin\u201d, says Vogel.\nVogels elaborates that this recent drop in price is indicative of a long term trend. He notes that it is just a reminder that cryptocurrency is volatile and it is typical of long term traders to jump at the opportunity to make discount buy-orders.\nA natural phenomenon\nThe President of Blockchain TV, Jason Cassidy explains that as the collective market cap for cryptocurrencies grows it is only natural to see pull backs such as experienced recently. He notes that regardless of what is driving the market down that such market behaviour is healthy to have \u2018breathers\u2019 in between adding hundreds of billions of dollars to the market capitalization in rapid succession.\nOn the impact that Asia is having on cryptocurrencies, Cassidy says:\n\u201cCurrently a large amount of global trading volume takes place in the East, so China has and will continue to have an impact on the markets. As always, the top currencies will recover the fastest and live to see another day. You will notice market swings like this can also be the catalyst for the end of life cycle for low-value coins or outright scams. Bitconnect is a recent example of this. \u201cExpect to see more malinvestment cleared out of the industry as the overall IQ of the space matures.\u201d\nA \u2018shake-up\u2019 in the industry\nNascent projects within the crypto space, especially those with base in Asia are being affected by this development. It takes significant robustness and genuine expertise for emerging projects to survive seasons like this where authorities make ambiguous regulatory statements, leaving the community with a lot of uncertainties.\nSituations like this are necessary to separate actual developmental products from \u2018paper-based\u2019 arrangements that give the industry a bad name. However, relevant authorities need to come up with clear terms and to do so quickly in order to avoid the market uncertainty that is responsible for the panic within the ecosystem.\nRepeated events have shown how significant the Asian community is to the blockchain industry. Having led the way in the early adoption of the technology, and natural factors such as population, which by extension influences the market size have placed the region in a prominent position within the industry. For how long this will continue remains to be known, but the power of Asia in the current crypto industry can no longer be taken for granted.", "category": "News"}

BitGo demonstrated that without a block size increase to 2MB, bitcoin blocks can expand to 2MB with SegWit integrated.\n\nThe first 2MB bitcoin blocks were mined this weekend (see block 505253 https://t.co/0Eeh5Jk05E \u2013 2.217 MB). These record block sizes were made possible by transactions with numerous segwit inputs created on BitGo with super low fees.

Compared to our previous study in 2016, we see that the median bandwidth for a Bitcoin node has increased by a factor of 1.7x. The typical Bitcoin node has much more bandwidth available to it than it did before. Higher allocated bandwidth indicates that the maximum block size can be increased without impacting orphan rates, which in turn affect decentralization,\u201d read the research paper.\nIn the mid-term, if on-chain scaling is implemented, its synergy with SegWit and two-layer scaling solutions like Lightning is expected to expand the capacity of the bitcoin blockchain. If the bitcoin blockchain network can handle more transaction, the network will be less congested, leading to lower fees and faster confirmation periods even for large transactions.\nSince it remains unclear whether $1 fees on the Bitcoin network are sustainable in the mid-term, and it could take businesses many months to adopt both SegWit and Lightning, on-chain scaling as a mid-term solution is a possibility.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Casares, a serial entrepreneur, has launched startups across South America and the United States, not the least of which is bitcoin wallet startup Xapo, which he currently leads. Casares is also a member of the PayPal board. Schulman touts Casares as one of the foremost authorities globally on bitcoin and blockchain.\nBitcoin & Blockchain Changing the World\nSchulman pointed to the bitcoin price, which at the time of the interview was trading at $14,800, clairvoyantly predicting that the price could change even as he spoke. Bitcoin and blockchain have captured people\u2019s attention because they view it as an \u201cinteresting experiment,\u201d said Casares. \u201cIf it works out, it could change the world more than the internet changed it,\u201d he added.\nCasares warned, however, that given the nature of an experiment, bitcoin and blockchain \u201ccould also fail.\u201d He gives the bitcoin and blockchain experiment a 20% chance \u2014 at least \u2014 of failure. He gave key investment advice, recommending that people don\u2019t own more of the cryptocurrency than they can afford to lose.\nBut after the warning, Casares provided a silver lining, saying there\u2019s greater than a 50% chance that the bitcoin and blockchain experiment will succeed. But industry participants must be patient, as it will take anywhere from five years to a decade before that success is solidified.\nIn a successful experiment, he pointed to a different world and \u201cconcrete economic consequences,\u201d saying \u201cone bitcoin is going to be worth $1 million. So, most of the world is going to wish they had bought it at $14,000 or $20,000\u201d the risk notwithstanding and putting today\u2019s bitcoin price declines in perspective.\nBitcoin Believer\nArgentinian-born Casares has distinct memories from his childhood of his family losing everything, thrice. He characterizes those memories as \u201cemotional\u201d and \u201csocial\u201d rather than economic, and points to the Argentinian government as having triggered events that led to the fallout \u2014 hyperinflation, for instance. It was two steps forward and three steps back for his family as a result of government activity, even confiscating bank accounts.\nHis childhood experience, coupled with an awareness of the world\u2019s unbanked citizens without the luxury of the US dollar, seems to have shaped his belief in bitcoin. \u201cIt was the first time that I could see technology solving that problem for good,\u201d he said. As a result, he\u2019s pledged the rest of his career and is staking his reputation on it. He is pulling for the bitcoin experiment to succeed\u00a0because if it does, we\u2019ll have a much better world than we have today, he said.\nCalling Out Ignorance\nWhile it may be fashionable to do so, for someone to draw a distinction between bitcoin and the underlying protocol, saying they have an interest in blockchain but not bitcoin, shows \u201cignorance for how the system works,\u201d Cesares said, likening the comparison to the web and the internet. \u201cBlockchain doesn\u2019t exist without bitcoin,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t till January 2009 that the blockchain \u201ccame to life\u201d because that\u2019s when we could trust the integrity of data without knowing hardware, software or jurisdiction\u00a0because it doesn\u2019t matter. With blockchain, there are no counterparties.\n\u201cIf you were to remove the bitcoin, miners would disappear and so would the blockchain,\u201d said Casares.\nAs for the future of altcoins, he reminded PayPal\u2019s Schulman that it\u2019s an experiment, one whose outcome\u00a0no one knows. Casares also predicts a single blockchain for value, with the exception of certain use cases that merit a different blockchain, similar to how there\u2019s only one internet. He predicts that the most likely blockchain will be bitcoin, which hasn\u2019t suffered any hacks, but he admits that his prediction is highly speculative.\nCryptocurrencies & Blockchain\nAs for use cases of the blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies, Casares suggests that the sky\u2019s the limit, or people\u2019s creativity is the limit in terms of use cases separate from value. He envisions a world where bitcoin is a global and non-political standard of value and settlement, so that future generations reflect back on traditional exchange rates as nostalgic. He sees a world where bitcoin wins whether or not Wall Street or Silicon Valley venture capitalists believe.\nAs for the bitcoin and blockchain grand experiment, signs of success would be more of what we have been seeing for the past nine years for the next nine years. \u201cProtocols have their own timing, a much longer time horizon than companies have,\u201d Casares said.\nFailure, meanwhile, could be the result of various scenarios. \u201cThe main way in which bitcoin could fail is if we begin to put into bitcoin money we cannot afford to lose,\u201d he concluded. In other words, don\u2019t put your kid\u2019s college fund or retirement savings into bitcoin.\nThe Facebook Live broadcast aired on Jan. 11.\u00a0Schulman also used the live platform to announce that the PayPal community from the first time over the holidays raised more than $1 billion in charitable donations globally.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

At present, bitcoin is trading at $10,479 on Bitfinex, which translates into a $180.7 billion global market cap.\nBitcoin Price Chart\nDespite this moderate pullback, positive news coming out of South Korea should provide investors with confidence.

The ethereum price dropped below $1,000 this afternoon, punctuating a precipitous six percent decline. At present, ethereum is trading at $973, which gives the second-largest cryptocurrency a $95.9 billion market cap.\nEthereum Price Chart\nEOS, Stellar Stand Out in Otherwise Disappointing Altcoin Market\nAltcoins engaged in a widespread decline, but both EOS and stellar posted strong returns in what was otherwise a disappointing day for the volatile cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe ripple price declined approximately 11 percent for the day, which constituted the worst performance among top 10-cryptocurrencies. The pullback reduced the third-largest cryptocurrency\u2019s market cap to $46.7 billion.\nThe bitcoin cash price, meanwhile, posted a daily decline 10 percent and is currently trading at $1,597 with a $27 billion market cap.\nCardano, litecoin, NEM, and NEO each saw their prices ebb by close to eight percent, highlighting the degree to which the correction permeated the wider markets.\nTwo top-tier altcoins, however, managed to defy the overall market trend and post positive returns. The most impressive rally came from stellar, which achieved a five percent price rally despite the overall correction. Stellar now has a market cap of $8.6 billion, which ranks it eighth on the market cap charts.\nThe day\u2019s second-best performance came from EOS, which climbed about four-and-a-half percent to bring its price to nearly $14 and raise its market cap to $13.6 billion.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

And perhaps some more excitement.\nThere is a dramatic increase in the correlation between the price of bitcoin and Wall Street\u2019s \u2018Fear Index\u2019, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank. A Friday note from global financial strategist Masao Muraki at Deutsche Bank argued that the \u201ccorrelation between Bitcoin and VIX has increased dramatically\u201d.\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) is colloquially referred to on Wall Street as the Fear Index. It is the most widely reported barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility. VIX measures a market estimate of future volatility. It is currently at near record-low levels, meaning investors expect nothing much to happen in the stock market. \nThe NYSE has enjoyed a nine-year bull market, the second-longest in recent financial history. The US economy is growing at a steady rate, recording annual GDP growth at around 3.2% in the third quarter of 2017. While the 20x P/E ratio average among US equities is approaching overvaluation, a steadily growing economy provides solid support for valuation fundamentals.\nSimultaneously, the low interest rate policy the Fed initiated in the wake of the recession that followed the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 has been prolonged. Since dragging interest rates down to zero during the financial crisis, the Fed\u2019s policymaking committee has raised rates only five times. The most recent hike was in December, lifting the benchmark short-term federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.25 to 1.5 percent.\nProtracted low interest rates forced investors to the stock market to seek decent returns on their money. The market has risen steadily due to this TINA effect (TINA is the acronym for There Is No Alternative). Now the low VIX is forcing them to look even further, to frontier asset classes. The cryptocurrency market is the beneficiary of those moves, Deutsche Bank argues.\n\n\u00a0\nBetween December 2017 to the time of writing, the VIX has sat at historically low levels, suggestion extremely low market volatility. The cryptocurrency market in the same period has seen wild fluctuations, with double-digit gains and losses over a 24-hour period just a normal day in the crypto-space.\nOn December 22nd, for example, the bitcoin price plunged 22%. Yet it had been up 91% since a month earlier. According to coinmarketcap, Tron, a lesser-known cryptocurrency, doubled in price over 36 hours from January 17th to 19th.\n\nThese rapid and dramatic swings, familiar to cryptocurrency enthusiasts, are catching the attention of a Wall Street crowd seemingly bored with too little to fear. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "category": "Bitcoin Trading"}

Since then, in the past three hours, the price of bitcoin has stabilized in the $16,300 region.\nCurrently, most of the largest trading pairs of bitcoin are alternative cryptocurrency-to-BTC pairs, including Tron (TRX), Ether, and Ripple. According to CoinMarketCap, Tron remains as the largest trading pair in the bitcoin market ahead of the USD-to-BTC pair, settling more than $2.8 billion on Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\nGiven that the price of bitcoin has been increasing over the past 24 hours while the valuation of other cryptocurrencies in the market slightly corrected, it can be stated that volumes are moving from alternative cryptocurrencies to bitcoin, which has become a reserve asset in the cryptocurrency market.\nThe bitcoin market has also seen many XRP-to-BTC trades amidst a sell-off, as investors that purchased XRPs based on unverified rumors that Coinbase was planning to integrate XRP left the market. The Ripple market cap has fallen by around $20 billion since Coinbase refuted the rumor. \nBrian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, wrote, \u201cWe haven\u2019t made any decisions to add new assets to Coinbase or GDAX at this time.

Although Ripple and Ethereum accounted for larger daily trading volumes on both Bithumb and Korbit throughout the past month, the trading volume of bitcoin in the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange has increased, surpassing that of Ether and Bitcoin Cash.\nMore to that, in Japan, formerly China\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Huobi and local entertainment conglomerate GMM are expected to launch cryptocurrency trading platforms this month, in January. \nWith Huobi (formerly China\u2019s largest exchange), GMO Group, BitFlyer, and GMM, the Japanese cryptocurrency landscape will drastically change and the mainstream adoption of bitcoin will further increase in the Japanese market.\nAnalysts expect the price of bitcoin to surge throughout January, especially if Nasdaq moves onto listing bitcoin futures within the first quarter of 2018 as planned. Both the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) have filed for six bitcoin exchange-traded funds, introducing a more efficient and regulated investment vehicles for accredited individual investors.\nThe support from major financial institutions remain exclusive to bitcoin, and none of the alternative cryptocurrencies in the market have seen commercial success through regulated futures and ETF listings.\n", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Both coins, however, managed to hold above dollar parity.\nThe litecoin price rose by nine percent, bringing a moderate reversal to its recent downtrend, but the day\u2019s best performance came from TRON, which added another 30 percent to its surging market cap ahead of what investors believe will be a major partnership announcement.\nThe stellar price plunged by 18 percent, and the IOTA price rose one-half-of-one percent to round out the top 10.\nWrite to Josiah Wilmoth at josiah.wilmoth(at)ccn.com.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

Kimball, the US government stated that it is costly to securely store the seized cryptocurrencies for a long period of time. According to the court document, the USMS has been paid $465 per month to store the two cryptocurrencies.\nThe US government also expressed its concerns over the high volatility rate of bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, and suggested to sell the two cryptocurrencies before their value depreciate.\n\u201cThe vehicles [bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash] have been seized and are in the custody and control of the United States Marshals Service. Every month, the USMS is accruing $465/month in storage fees for these vehicles. The total expenses for these two vehicles currently is $5,010.70. The BTC and BCH have been transferred to a Government wallet. Due to the volatile market for cryptocurrencies, the BTC and BCH risk losing value during the pendency of the forfeiture proceedings,\u201d read the court document.\nUS Government Lost $2.36 Billion by Selling Bitcoin Early\nIn October, it was disclosed that the US government sold 144,336 bitcoins at a price of $336 per bitcoin. The entire batch of 144,336 bitcoins were sold at $48.5 million. At the time, the US government sold bitcoin with the same line of thinking with the most recent sale, assuming that the price of bitcoin would decline due to its volatility.\nToday, the 144,336 bitcoins the US government sold in 2014 at $48.5 million is worth $2.36 billion. The opportunity cost for selling bitcoin three years early for the US government was $2.02 billion.\n\nIn the next few weeks, the US government is expected to proceed with the sale of the 513 bitcoins and 512 Bitcoin Cash at the current value of around $8.5 million. \nBy 2021, three years from now, the opportunity cost for the US government in selling the assets seized from a dark web investigation into Shamo could be significantly higher, given that the cryptocurrency industry is still at an early phase in development, adoption, and growth.", "category": "Bitcoin Crime"}

Shortly thereafter, Ripple became the second largest cryptocurrency market again, as its market cap increased to $89 billion.\n\n#Ethereum overtakes #Ripple to regain its title as the second most valuable cryptocurrency in the market with a $88 billion market valuation.\nNever enough popcorn in the cryptocurrency market. pic.twitter.com/PL3N8fP2Gz\n\u2014 Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) January 2, 2018\nThe sudden increase in the price of Ether led to the decline of the dominance index of bitcoin, which measures the dominance of bitcoin over the global cryptocurrency market. The dominance index of bitcoin declined to an all-time low to 36 percent.\nIn terms of developer and overall network activity, the Ethereum blockchain network has been performing at its highest level as of late. Significant progress has been made with its proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol development through the testing of Casper on the Ethereum testnet.\nDecentralized applications such as CryptoKitties have begun to demonstrate the potential of the Ethereum network in processing peer-to-peer digital asset trading, which can be utilized in the traditional finance sector to seamlessly exchange assets, commodities, and currencies in a decentralized manner. \nOptimism surrounding the strong performance of decentralized applications and the increase in support by major blockchain startups like the $1.6 billion cryptocurrency brokerage Coinbase have led the market to build confidence around the short and mid-term performance of Ether.\nThis week, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated that the company will focus on the development of Toshi, an Ethereum decentralized application browser, to improve the accessibility to decentralized applications for casual users. He wrote:\n\u201cOur theory is that the smartphone + ethereum + dapps offer an unprecedented opportunity to bring this to people all over the world. We\u2019re attempting to increase the economic freedom of the world, and clean up some bad behavior in the lowest scoring countries.\nIt can be easy to take the above tools for granted if you\u2019ve only ever lived in developed countries. But for the majority of people living in the world today, those tools are inaccessible.\u201d\nCurrently, without a massive influx of mainstream media coverage and virality, it is extremely difficult for decentralized applications to appeal to the general public. But, improved infrastructure and introduction of a marketplace for decentralized applications would further increase the usability and accessibility of the Ethereum network.\nStrong Demand From South Korea\nIn the South Korean market, Ether is being traded at above $1,100. On Bithumb, South Korea\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Ethereum is being traded at $1,116, with a $300 million daily trading volume.\nConsidering that other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Litecoin are not being traded with significant premiums, the demand for Ether in the South Korean market is evidently strong. \nIn the short-term, Ethereum is in an optimal position to surpass Ripple in value, given its recent price trend. If the demand for Ether in the global cryptocurrency market can match that of the South Korean market, Ether\u2019s price would be able to surpass $1,000 relatively quickly.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

Following the initial report of SBS, other mainstream media outlets, especially finance and business-focused news publications, started to cover Bitcoin Cash more actively, ultimately leading the price of the cryptocurrency to surge.\n\nApart from the mainstream media coverage Bitcoin Cash has been receiving, the entire cryptocurrency market has started to receive more attention from the general public due to the recent success of cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThis week, SBS and KBS, two of the largest networks and mainstream media outlets in the country, reported that South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit have started to add more employees than banks and financial institutions in the traditional finance market.\n\nSouth Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, especially Bithumb, are adding more employees than banks and major financial service providers.\nAll over mainstream media today, optimistic trend overall. Government calls on exchanges to operate as regulated banks. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/mYKd2LTXKB\n\u2014 Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) January 6, 2018\nThe hiring of a massive number of employees by South Korea\u2019s major cryptocurrency exchanges has given general consumers and investors in the market confidence that the local cryptocurrency market is growing at a rapid rate, even with the strict regulations imposed by the government.\nJob security and opportunities are sensitive subjects in South Korea because fresh university graduates have started to struggle in finding decent jobs as companies have started to favor skillful and experienced employees. Hence, if a company or a sector start to hire many employees, the attention of young individuals naturally shift to that particular industry. A similar trend has been shown by the cryptocurrency market. \u00a0\nHigh Premium\nConsequently, the demand for cryptocurrencies in South Korea has exponentially grown, pushing the premium rates of the South Korean market even further up. Bitcoin Cash is currently being traded in the South Korean market with a $900 premium, or a staggering 30 percent premium, which is the highest its ever been.\nThe imposition of a cryptocurrency trading ban for foreigners have led to larger premium rates and disparity in the price of major digital assets between South Korea and the rest of the global market.\nHigh premium rates in the South Korean market will likely sustain in the long run, because it is virtually impossible for foreign investors to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity in South Korea.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

It\u2019s unfortunate, but if they miss it, there\u2019ll be very little to talk about with their non-crypto friends\u00a0on Monday. This year cryptocurrency professionals and enthusiasts around the world can combine their two loves with an Ethereum smart contract they can use to gamble on the Superbowl.\nGambling with cryptocurrencies is nothing new. As a matter of fact, in a report by\u00a0Credit Suisse\u00a0this summer gambling ICO\u2019s dominated the market by sheer number. As a matter of fact, whole ICO\u2019s, such as XWIN\u00a0have been dedicated to creating a trustless platform for sports gambling.\nNone of these platforms are live yet and many are still months out from conducting ICO\u2019s. Even so, what differentiates CryptoBowl\u00a0is how simple it is. It\u2019s about 1200 lines of code on an Ethereum contract. It simply checks WolframAlpha\u2018s API to see who won the Superbowl and makes payouts accordingly. The smart contract utilizes Oraclize.it\u2019s API in order to communicate the results back to the smart contract. In the midst of the cryptomania as of late, it\u2019s simplicity is incredibly refreshing.\ncryptobowl.co website screenshot.\nIt\u2019s so simple, as a matter of fact, that the website\u2019s slogan is \u201cNo ICO, no bullshit.\u201d The mere existence of this product is definitely reflective of the fatigue felt by crypto traders as of late with the explosion of ICO\u2019s in recent months and the rampant price fluctuations and uncertain market conditions. Nonetheless, it hasn\u2019t proved too popular thus far. As of press time, about $200 worth of Ethereum seems to have been contributed in total with New England in the lead.\nThe distribution mechanism also results in a self-creating spread. According to the FAQ on the bottom of the website The winners will receive their money back plus the losers pot (minus 10% for the creators of the website) in proportion to what they have contributed. This self-creating and adjusting spread is an interesting way to go on a trustless platform and maybe a trend going forward.\nWhile this smart contract obviously represents a microscopic portion of the sports gambling market, it\u2019s a definite sign of things to come in the crypto space. As more ICO\u2019s take off they\u2019ll have to deal with problems like setting a spread. More importantly, they\u2019ll need to find a better way to retrieve results than through a centralized system. I look forward to seeing how much more (if any) money is put into this before it closes tonight.", "category": "Ethereum News"}

(MCC is a system of categorization for merchants so tax agencies can follow the trail.)\nThe charges add insult to injury from the banking community, which in the US has taken to banning credit card purchases of digital currencies altogether. While not collecting these added fees, Coinbase did commit a faux pas, pointing to poor communication to its users.\n\nCoinbase defended itself, saying of the fees, \u201cunfortunately we don\u2019t have a way of knowing when they might be charged or how much they might be.\u201d They give a word of advice, which is for buyers to contact their banks and request the fees be waived. If that doesn\u2019t work, change cards to a bank with lower fees.\nMeanwhile, Coinbase followers on Twitter lamented the exchange\u2019s response \u2013\n\nOne-Two Punch\nIn a one-two punch, Coinbase in addition to the added fees also addressed the ban that US banks \u2014 including Chase, Bank of America, Citi and Capital One \u2014 banned credit card transactions for digital coins. To troubleshoot the ban and the fees as well as experience higher weekly limits, Coinbase informs investors: \u201cAll debit card transactions remain unaffected.\u201d\nLimits vary depending on the linked accounts by which investors perform transactions, and there\u2019s a separate \u201coverall limit for your Coinbase account regardless of which payment method is used,\u201d as per Coinbase.\nIn addition to a subtle warning on its site, Coinbase\u00a0is urging\u00a0users\u00a0via\u00a0an email sent to\u00a0switch to debit card payments.\u00a0You can view a copy of that email in CCN\u2019s previous coverage here.\nInvestors can buy bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethreum or Litecoin, which are the four digital coins that Coinbase currently accepts, via debit card or bank account.

Monahan\u2019s vision seemingly involved assembling a team over the past 9 months to launch My Crypto.\nHer blog post reads:\n\u201cMyEtherWallet LLC was sufficient for the early stages of growth. MyCrypto is designed with next-level scaling in mind from the beginning.\u201d\nHemachandra has since revealed that MEW will continue to provide a community service, by serving as a window to the Ethereum blockchain. Monahan presumably plans on building a business around MyCrypto.com. According to TechCrunch, the new project hasn\u2019t raised VC funding \u201cyet.\u201d\nA Potential \u201cUnlawful\u201d Social Media Takeover\nThe @myetherwallet Twitter account was suddenly changed by Monahan, to MyCrypto after the new project was announced. This hurt both services in the eyes of various cryptocurrency enthusiasts as it wasn\u2019t previously announced.\nThe now MyCrypto account has since confirmed it rebranded and hasn\u2019t been compromised. The takeover was explained through a tweet.\n\npic.twitter.com/6a8BQIaezF\n\u2014 MyCrypto.com (@mycrypto) February 9, 2018\n\nMEW has since created a new Twitter account that hasn\u2019t yet acquired the blue checkmark, which could be a security risk. Hemachandra has since taken to twitter to suggest the social media account\u2019s takeover may have been \u201cunlawful.\u201d\n\nhttps://t.co/zD327znNCg is secure and functioning normally. Your wallets have not been compromised, and you may continue to use MEW as intended. At present, however, we are investigating what we believe to be an improper, perhaps unlawful, social media account switch\n\u2014 Kosala (@kvhnuke_) February 9, 2018\n", "category": "Companies"}

The oil and gas industry is generally considered slow to change, however, since the oil glut that drove prices to record lows starting in 2014, hydrocarbon companies have been adapting at a rapid pace to survive.\nSeparate Moving Parts Align into One\nEthereum-based project developer ConsenSys\u00a0and Paris-based, cash-to-order-automation company Amalto\u00a0are developing an Ethereum-based blockchain, joint-venture called Ondiflo. This joint-venture would\u00a0provide digital solutions\u00a0for order-to-cash processing. The digitized process will improve production and hauling efforts in a synchronized environment producing benefits such as improved scheduling and dispatching, accurate measurement of discharged fluid volume, precise invoicing, significantly reduced revenue leakage, and zero to very few coding errors.\nFrom Paper to Digital\nOnce set up, Ondiflo would be based in Houston, Texas, the heartland of the U.S. oil and gas industry. The company would use Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts to develop a ticket-based automated system to streamline and enhance the order-to-cash processes related to oilfield services contact services in the up-, mid-, and downstream sectors of the industry. These processes are still being executed by processing physical paperwork. Additionally, data verification through proof of work would be another benefit. Transactions could be settled in only a matter of hours, compared to days. Furthermore, it could\u00a0reduce the number of potential points in which errors could occur. Once the technology is set up and the process adopted, companies would see an overall efficiency increase in conjunction with increased profits.\nConsenSys founder Joe Lubin sums up the power of the blockchain:\n\u00a0As one of our first ventures into the oil and gas supply chain industry, Ondiflo will offer a solution where all operators and service companies can benefit from digitization, automation and the seamless exchange of data and immutability of their records, made possible by the Ethereum platform. Ondiflo will deliver efficiency to processes, which today are still largely manual and paper-based, like field ticketing or bill of lading, and are ready for the blockchain.\nFacilitates Accounts Payable \nIn the oil and gas industry, companies must deal with a high rate of days sales outstanding (DSO). This period is usually around 90 days from the order date to the payment date. The longer a company goes without collecting the balance due, then the more chances the company has to fall into a cycle of cash-flow disorders. In this case, the company is selling on credit to its customers and maintains a high debt-to-accounts-receivable ratio. In dealing with DSO rates, a happy medium is to be desired, because a rate that is too low, indicates that a company is too strict with its credit and may drive away potential customers.\nWhat\u2019s the next step for Ondiflo?\nA stakeholder\u2019s meeting is set to take place on 15 February 2018. After this meeting concludes, a plan will be set for the joint-venture to follow and launch Ondiflo. More developments on this status will surface after this date.", "category": "Ethereum News"}

Clearly, the firm desires to go deeper into data rather than stick to its old business model and profit from hardware.\nSelling data is the future and Bosch views IOTA and autonomous cars as a great way to collect micropayments and information.\nAdd this to the fact the city of Taipai, South Korea is set to use IOTA to turn the city into an app-driven smart city. Its obvious IOTA is really making some waves.\nIOTA\u2019s data marketplace has been in the making since 2015. Around the same time, IBM spent $2 billion to acquire the Weather Company. The sole reason for the purchase was to get access to data.\nIOTA\u2019s Automotive Ambitions\nIOTA is already taking care of $10 billion worth of transactions on its ledger. Wireless no fee micro-payments relating to electric vehicle charging and parking are already happening.\nAs the exchange and value of data continues to grow in volume, IOTA\u2019s value will continue to grow on the open market.\nThe Future Is Friendly\nThe five most valuable publicly traded companies in the world all rely on data as their number one commodity. Those companies include Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company).\nThe Internet of Things industry is approximately growing at a rate of 28.5% annually. Boston Consulting Group predicts the industry will be worth $267 billion by the year 2020.\nConsider where IOTA\u2019s tangle technology lies within these two trends. Couple that with its commitment to building \u2018smart cities\u2019. It makes perfect sense for Robert Bosch to jump on board now and ride the wave into the future.\nA future where self-driving cars will be able to platoon together on the freeway, saving fuel and moving faster in a safer way than cars have ever been able to do before. This will all be possible thanks to data, and the real-world application of it is what makes the Bosch/IOTA partnership an interesting one to watch for the long run. Cryptocurrency prices are currently rebounding after a strong recent downturn. Perhaps Robert Bosch and IOTA will prove the long-term value of the IOTA token.\nAs long as they don\u2019t mislead the public about the nature of their partnership the way they did with Microsoft of course.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

With a market valuation today of $10 per XRB, the to, al loss is estimated to be $170m.\nThe Nano Core team were informed by the owner of BitGrail, Francesco \u201cThe Bomber\u201d Firano of the loss on Thursday. In a blog update they report that the fault appears to be related to BitGrail\u2019s software. In private correspondence, Firano allegedly inquired as to the possibility of modifying the ledger in order to cover his losses, but the development team responded that this line of action:\u201d[I]s not possible, nor is it a direction we would ever pursue.\u201d\nThe blog posts then makes subtle accusations regarding the legitimacy of the hack, stating that:\n\u201cWe now have sufficient reason to believe that Firano has been misleading the Nano Core Team and the community regarding the solvency of the BitGrail exchange for a significant period of time.\u201d\nThe team adds that criminal investigations are underway:\n\u201cOur team promptly contacted law enforcement and we are fully cooperating with law enforcement on this matter\u2026.We are preparing all information we have on the matter such as blockchain entries, screenshots, and chat logs\u201d\nFollowing the loss of XRB Bitgrail has claimed insolvency and is not in operation, whilst unofficial sources claim that the exchange had been insolvent months earlier. The source in question claims to have discovered that the account from which user funds had supposedly been lost funds, (BitGrail Representative 1), had multiple transactions of large even numbers, (e.g. 3000, 5000, 8000 XRB) to the Mercatox exchange. He/ she describes this behavior as suspicious, adding that:\n\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t look organic.\u201d\nAnother user took to Reddit, conducting an AMA post (As Me Anything) titled \u201cI lost 147k Nano ($1.4 M and falling) in the Bitgrail hack.\u201d The user responded with surprising positivity to the terrible news:\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided that the only way to deal with this is to move on as quickly as possible and keep making solid decisions. Negative emotions in times like these serve no one. I will continue to invest in cryptocurrency to the degree that I believe it has potential, and if it does, the worst decision I can make right now is stopping. I will be much, much more careful with exchanges in the future.\u201d\nWhen commended by other uses for his/her mental fortitude, the user outlined a community-minded approach, putting others before themselves:\n\u201cI hope that by doing this AMA, I can help some other people who lost funds understand how to respond in a healthy manner. The only thing you can do is continue to make rational decisions that do you & others the most good. If money makes you do terrible things, it matters too much to you.\u201d\nThis approach sets out a responsible and healthy attitude to the financial loss that sadly is frequently experienced in the cryptocurrency world. It comes as a reminder to keep financial matters in perspective, contrasting with the sad news that a young Korean Bitcoin investor committed suicide\u00a0due to the recent crypto crash.\nNano (XRB) was previously known as RaiBlocks. It uses a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) protocol similar to IOTA, with zero fees and scalability advantages. There is a maximum supply of 133 million coins which are all in circulation, and so the breach represents a loss of over 10% of the total supply.\nUsers of the exchange had been reporting issues prior to the event, with many waiting for identity registration. Many users also reported being unable to withdraw their XRB from the exchange. BitGrail had been a popular choice for Nano investors, as one of the first exchanges to open trading on the coin.", "category": "Exchanges"}

The announcement that the brand was turning to blockchain with KODAKCoin, which aims to protect photographers\u2019 digital rights utilizing immutable distributed ledger technology, swept through the crypto space. Despite the ICO\u2019s early wobbles, when the coin finally launched it tripled\u00a0from its ICO price, leaving initial investors pleased and observers optimistic regarding the company\u2019s transformed future.\nHowever, investment research firm Kerrisdale Capital this week has released a crippling 22-page indictment on the project.\nReferring to the company as a \u201cdying relic of American manufacturing\u201d, (KODAK went bankrupt in 2013), Kerrisdale sees the $300m ICO as a cash grab that \u201cwill never deliver promised benefits\u201d.\nTheir report is damning, stating that whilst:\u201cblockchain and cryptocurrencies are exciting technologies with the potential to disrupt many industries; their use in media rights licensing by KODAKOne will not be one of them\u201d.\nThey go on to describe the project as a \u201cmoribund company\u2019s hollow attempt to chase the ICO craze\u201d and the team as having \u201czero credibility\u201d.\nInvestors were further warned that the cryptotoken is in their eyes of no value, stating:\n\u201cWe view the equity as worthless, implying downside of -100%.\u201d\nIn Black and White\nThe central criticism is that the project uses buzzwords such as \u201cAI-enabled image recognition\u201d and \u201cencrypted digital ledger\u201d to generate hype and \u201cspeculative mania\u201d, obscuring the reality that the project cannot achieve it\u2019s stated goals. According to the firm, \u201ccryptographic hashing will not prove the provenance of IP and using blockchain does not diminish the resources necessary for infringement detection and enforcement\u201d.\nIn other words, the project won\u2019t be able to protect photographers any more than they currently are, and that \u201cthere is no practical advantage to using blockchain\u201d.\nAn unnamed blockchain expert the firm spoke with predicted that:\n\u201c[O]nce the speculative mania has left\u2026.what will be left will be a dry husk of a software application that will never do what it was marketed to do\u201d.\nThe report goes further than criticizing the blockchain platform, it also raises allegations of \u201chighly suspicious trading\u201d by the company and predicts future SEC investigation.\nLast month CCN reported upon the Kodak KashMiner,\u00a0a piece of crypto mining hardware leased by KODAK\u00a0 for $3400. In addition to the lease fee, customers were also obligated to return 50% of their mined Bitcoin to the company. Kerrisdale conducted further research on the mining rig, and discovered that it was allegedly a Bitmain Antminer S9 with the label replaced.\nThe report concludes that Kodak are \u201cimpostors\u201d with their attempt to jump on the blockchain tech bandwagon, and foresee that the funds they have generated will not protect the company from the \u201cgravity of dying, old-world fundamentals\u201d.\nThis report may come as yet another call for greater investor care in the speculative ICO market, in line with recent SEC regulatory plans. In this space, it\u2019s easy to generate hype and mania, covering the absence of working fundamentals or a viable model. Whether the report is accurate or not in it\u2019s assessment of KODAKCoin remains to be seen. The company provides assessment spanning a broad range of investments, from pharmaceuticals to popular retailers, and so are not blockchain specific experts.", "category": "News"}

To gain an understanding of how easy it is to use. Download the demo and let this video guide you:\n\nProceed with caution. For now Mallers maintains the Beta solution isn\u2019t ready for a mainnet launch just yet. Any attempt to transfer cryptocurrency through the Beta app can result in a loss of funds and backlog the apps developers in continuing to make progress.\nWhat Is Lightning Network?\nThe Lightning Network allows for the scaling of bitcoin transactions and a dramatic increase of payment speed through the use of smart contracts. This is all done away from the blockchain initially so there\u2019s no need to worry about block confirmation times.\nThis means payments can now be made without custodians, making Lightning Network a much more scalable and sustainable solution for the long term. It has the potential to handle billions of transactions.\nIt will also be possible to make transactions between different chains as long as the chains can support the same cryptographic hash functions. This again eliminates the need for third parties to be involved in signing off on a transaction.\nIf you want to dive deeper into the technicalities of the Lightning Network, take a look at the whitepaper and PowerPoint presentations available. Or watch this handy explanation:\n\nProgress Being Made\nA Reddit user hinted just a week ago that they have successfully completed the first purchase of physical goods on the Lightning Network. This comes less than four months after developers at Blockstream used testnet coins to complete one of the very first transactions on the network.\nNow that testing is well underway and real BTCs are being exchanged, Zap aims to be the next step in Lightning Network\u2019s progression. It makes sense given that the original Lightning Network demo features a lot of command line coding that non-programmer friendly bitcoin users will undoubtedly be confused by:\n\nStill, Mr. Mallers and the rest of the LN open-source community warn that the kinks still need to be worked out before it can be widely used.

He was speaking\u00a0at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit for Crypto in New York earlier this week.\nHe spoke of \u201cactive engagement\u201d with blockchain internally, as teams from across the bank\u2019s operations are increasingly looking to distributed ledger technology as a possible solution to problems. Farooq\u2019s at the head of that business, and he\u2019s more open-minded about bitcoin than you might think.\nHe said that while the industry may say blockchain\u2019s\u00a0good and bitcoin\u2019s bad, that\u2019s now how JPMorgan, the top US bank based on assets, sees the world. \u201cWe all believe in blockchain good. I wouldn\u2019t go as far to say cryptocurrencies bad. I would say and cryptocurrencies have issues.\u201d\nThe big issue, he says, surrounds know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules.\n\u201cEveryone I talk to in the banking industry, regulators, central banks \u2014 everyone sees the potential. But everyone is trying to fundamentally grapple with the issues. I wouldn\u2019t say crypto is bad, but I think crypto needs some evolution,\u201d he said.\nElephant in the Room\nMeanwhile, he wasn\u2019t afraid to tackle the elephant in the room, his boss Jamie Dimon\u2019s previous derogatory remarks on bitcoin, offering some perspective.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s backed off, clarified a couple of comments. He\u2019s always been super consistent in breaking the two apart cryptocurrencies versus blockchain. In terms of cryptocurrencies, given right now the banking industry is facing these questions, I think his comments were quite relevant to the times. If you talk to many regulators, they possibly have similar feelings,\u201d said Farooq.\nBut he wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say that JPMorgan has plans to roll out a bitcoin product to retail investors in the near future, saying: \u201cAt this point, everyone is studying the stuff.\u201d\u00a0Once policies are developed reflecting KYC and AML standards, \u201cthen the retail bank will take a hard look at how to do this,\u201d he added.\nRadical Impact\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan has been exploring blockchain technology for the past two years when the market was still \u201cnascent,\u201d having developed Quorum, based on Ethereum, which was open-sourced and brought Jamie Morgan to GitHub. He doesn\u2019t view the technology as a threat for now.\nFarooq expects blockchain will have a \u201cradical impact\u201d on some of the bank\u2019s businesses, particularly as it relates to providing trust between parties.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s always a role for a trusted advisor in the mix,\u201d he said, adding the bank could provide infrastructure or facilitate the data layer. \u201cThere will always be a role. It\u2019s not an existential threat in the short-term.\u201d\nBlockchain has gripped JPMorgan, as evidenced by a blockchain virtual room for messaging that\u2019s ballooned to more than 1,500 people. He said his team started small and now every line of business at the firm has blockchain representation. They approach the blockchain group saying a problem \u201csmells or feels\u201d like it could use the blockchain for data transfer, reconciliation, etc.\u00a0 Today the blockchain group is engaged with multiple businesses across payments, capital markets and custody.\n\u201cOur fundamental approach to blockchain is we think about the customer issue we want to solve \u2026 80% of the time, blockchain isn\u2019t the answer and it ends up being an infrastructure issue.

Their letter was specifically copied for Argentina\u2019s minister of finance, Nicolas Dujovne.\nG20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, and includes representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, according to the G20 Information Centre.\nCrypto\u2019s Rise Brings Alarm\nThe letter noted the \u201csignificant rise and the volatility in the valuation and market capitalization over the past year of digital instruments issued through distributed ledger technology.\u201d\nThe officials said the G20 could adopt appropriate, \u201cinternational harmonized actions\u201d recognizing the \u201ctransboundary implications\u201d of cryptocurrencies. They acknowledged cryptocurrencies present a fast evolving tool, but at the same time pose risks for investors and can be vulnerable to financial crimes.\nFour Challenges\nThe letter cited four challenges:\n1) Understanding the nature of crypto tokens. The officials said such tokens are mislabeled as \u201ccurrencies,\u201d and that regulators hold disparate views about the nature of such tokens that result in a \u201clack of clarity for investors\u201d that will cause speculation.\nThey called for a clear distinction between the tokens and the underlying distributed ledger technology that promises \u201csustainable innovation\u201d that Germany and France are pursuing.\n2) Monitoring the rising exposures of market participants to tokens in terms of market integrity and financial stability. Such implications appear to be limited at present, but considering the expanding capitalization of tokens and the new financial instruments, such developments must be closely monitored to prevent risks to financial stability. While there are no implications in monetary policy, the use of such tokens as a means of exchange should be monitored in the field of monetary policy. The intention by some central banks to issue cryptocurrencies must also be extensively monitored.\n3) Protecting non-professional investors. Better information is needed for investors who do not understand the risks they are exposing themselves to.\n4) A common approach is needed for anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. Cryptocurrencies have the potential for those who can make the worst use of them. Germany and France have taken regulatory measures in the field of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, and the European Union is following suit. But a coordinated global effort is needed.\nInternational Action Called For\nThe officials want the international forums that respond to the G20, such as FSB, FATF, BIS, to conduct a report on the four challenges raised by the G20 Finance Ministerial in July and propose possible guidelines for additional action.\nG20 should also consider asking the IMF to conduct a quantitative analysis of international financial stability issues related to crypto assets, the letter noted.", "category": "News"}

Carl Icahn in an interview with CNBC expressed his distaste for cryptocurrencies, calling them \u201cridiculous,\u201d but unlike others who were quick to write digital coins off, he admitted that in this case, the problem may lie with him.\nIn true curmudgeon style coupled with a dose of self-deprecation, he pointed to limited understanding and old age as two of the key reasons he\u2019s on the sidelines.\u00a0\u201cMaybe I\u2019m too old for them, but I wouldn\u2019t touch that stuff,\u201d he quipped. Separately, Warren Buffett, who similarly will only invest in companies whose business models he understands, doesn\u2019t predict a happy ending for cryptocurrencies. Though these baby boomers aren\u2019t buying, the millennial generation would increasingly choose bitcoin over other asset classes.\nCheck out the results from a recent Blockchain Capital poll \u2013\n\nCorporate Raider\nMeanwhile, Icahn, whose style is to raid corporations that he believes are undervalued, doesn\u2019t get the technology behind bitcoin and other altcoins.\u00a0 For instance, in the equity markets, if he spots a corporation that\u2019s \u201cpoorly managed\u201d or is a ripe candidate for a takeover, he knows what to do \u2014 swoop in, acquire enough equity shares to assert his influence on the board of directors and implement a change in direction.\nAmong the sectors of the economy that he\u2019s focused on are rail, food packaging and investment, which incidentally are migrating toward the blockchain.\nBut with cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s a completely different ballgame, as given the decentralized nature of the digital coin it can trade separate and apart from the entity that issued it if needed.

Major cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Bitcoin Cash all fell by over 10 percent.\nBitcoin and Ethereum Fall 10%\nAs CCN noted in yesterday\u2019s report, in periods of extreme volatility, the vast majority of cryptocurrencies in the market tend to follow the trend of two major cryptocurrencies: bitcoin and Ethereum. This morning, the price of both bitcoin and Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, fell by 10 percent, erasing gains made on February 10.\nEthereum peaked at $909 less than 24 hours ago, but throughout the rally, the daily trading volume of Ether across all major exchanges remained relatively low. Consequently, over the past 12 hours, the price of Ether declined from $909 to $793, stabilizing at $810. Given that Ether has experienced a steep decline in the past 24 hours, it is unlikely that the price of Ether would continue to decline unless it dips below $800.\n\nThe daily trading volume of Ether still remains low on major exchanges, and it is struggling to regain momentum.\nBitcoin has demonstrated a similar trend as Ether, dipping below $8,000 and falling to $7,950. Although it has gained back some of its losses, like Ether, it is testing the $8,000 region. Bitcoin also has low daily trading volume across major exchanges and thus, unless a short-term recovery is made, it is likely that the price of bitcoin will remain in the $8,100 region over the next 24 hours.\n\nHowever, if bitcoin and Ethereum can recover swiftly in the short-term, as the price of Ether surged from $780 to $900 on February 10, both cryptocurrencies have the potential to rebound back to yesterday\u2019s levels, especially if volumes can support their short-term momentum.\nMid-Term Trend\nEarlier this week, Roc Nation, the company founded by Jay Z, the rapper, producer, and media mogul, invested in Robinhood, the US-based financial services company that is launching its cryptocurrency trading platform called Robinhood Crypto later this year.\nNeil Sirni, the president of Arrive, a subsidiary company of Roc Nation, stated:\n\u201cWe believe in Baiju and Vlad\u2019s mission to make the financial markets more accessible and cost efficient for customers of all size. Robinhood will have our support as they execute the long-term vision of their company.\u201d\nThe official statement of Roc Nation emphasized Robinhood\u2019s mid-term plan of operating a cryptocurrency trading platform and its vision to improve the accessibility of the financial market.\nIf the global stock market continues to remain volatile and the cryptocurrency market recovers in the short-term as it did throughout this week, it is possible that investors in the traditional finance market could eye cryptocurrencies as mid-term investment to hedge against the global stock market. \nOverall, the market is showing some signs of mid-term recovery but the demand for cryptocurrencies and daily trading volumes of the market are not supporting the movement. For strong momentum to build up, daily trading volumes of major cryptocurrencies across large-scale cryptocurrency exchanges must remain relatively high.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

Bitstrade takes payments in bitcoin.\nThe Bureau\u2019s response comes in the wake of a meeting among federal lawmakers to discuss the crafting of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile,\u00a0AG Grewal said the Bureau is looking to \u201cprotect investors as they navigate the uncharted and largely unregulated domain of cryptocurrency-related investments.\u201d\n\u201cBitstrade is a prime example of a company seeking to capitalize on the cryptocurrency craze. Regulators, including the Bureau, are actively responding to fraudulent crypto-cloaked securities offerings,\u201d said Bureau chief\u00a0Christopher W. Gerold in the statement.\nThe state\u2019s approach has the hallmarks of similar action taken by Texas regulators against Bitconnect, leading to a series of events that led the bitcoin investment platform to shut its doors, which doesn\u2019t bode well for Bitstrade.\nOpaque Bitstrade\nBut with the exception of bitcoin, little is known of Bitstrade\u2019s investment approach.\u00a0They have a table on the home page listing the top 10 investors who wish to identify themselves alongside recent withdrawals.

The NJ Securities watchdog also took issue with a lack of transparency surrounding the Bitstrade management team, its headquarters, the health of the balance sheet, risks associated with the pooled investments and the precise securities that investors are gaining exposure to.\nA visit to the Bitstrade website reveals that they are domiciled in either Redlands, Calif. or Scottsdale, Ariz., but the NJ Bureau contests that the California address is fabricated while the other is a dead-end. Bitstrade\u00a0doesn\u2019t list its management team on the website. They claim to work with \u201ce-currencies,\u201d offering features such as instant deposits and withdrawals.\nCertainly, Bitstrade\u2019s business practices raise some eyebrows. But at the same time, the NJ Bureau doesn\u2019t appear to be a fan of cryptocurrencies, referring to them as \u201cvirtually anonymous\u201d and\u00a0saying they offer investors \u201cno recourse \u2026 to recoup their losses.\u201d\nBut some digital coins are more anonymous than others, and exchanges are increasingly engaged with regulators and lawmakers to stave off fraudulent activity.", "category": "News"}

The RFNC-VNIIEF press-service announced that the operation had been \u201ctimely suppressed\u201d, with Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB)\u00a0 immediately beginning investigations after picking up unauthorized data from the device.\u00a0No information was provided regarding the number of bitcoins successfully mined, or the identities of the accused.\nThe offenders will face criminal charges, according to the Russian source. Due to the institution\u2019s government connection the pair will allegedly be accused of \u201cstate-treason\u201d, although no information is available regarding the punishment this charge may imply.\u00a0 Allegedly they have been released from detention on the condition that they stay within the country.\nTatyana Zalesskaya, head of the research institute press service, spoke with the Russian source, stating that this was not the first occurrence of such a case:\n\u201cSimilar attempts have recently been registered in a number of large companies with large computing capacities\u201d\nThis is perhaps unsurprising, with individuals drawn to do\u00a0so by the sheer capabilities they offer. Supercomputers such as the one at the Sarov facility dwarf home mining rigs, enabling much faster block discovery \u2013 and therefore greater rewards. Moreover, using institutional computers is made more profitable still by allowing miners to circumvent the notoriously high electricity costs.\n\u00a0\nThe supercomputer in question is capable of one petaflop, or 1,000,000,000,000,000 FLOPS. FLOPS, (Floating Point Operations Per Second) are used to measure the performance of a computer\u2019s processor, and the unit petaflop is reserved for only the most powerful supercomputers. It has been operational since 2011, performing highly complex scientific calculations, and, as the most powerful supercomputer in Russia it would likely have been the most profitable for bitcoin mining. This is because\u00a0mining is a process that forces machines to do computational work, solving hash functions in order verify that process transactions on the network. It\u2019s a process where the faster a machine can check\u00a0 hashes, the more likely it is that it will be included in a block and be rewarded with Bitcoin, and in this digital race supercomputers have a clear and tantalizing advantage.\n\u00a0\nSarov was home to theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov, and is located in the Nizhny Novgorod region of the country. The state-owned facility, now officially closed, was until recently\u00a0code-named Arzamas-16 and absent from maps.\n\u00a0\nCryptocurrency mining is growing in popularity across Russia \u2013 a nation that often avoids the central issue of keeping mining machines cool due to it\u2019s long and cold winters. It has become widely known, receiving endorsement from leader Vladimir Putin\u2019s aide Dmitry Marinichev, who has publicly spoken regarding the ease of setting up a mining rig. The notoriety of crypto in this country is clear, with Russia last October announcing plans to issue an official state cryptocurrency, the CryptoRuble, and adopting a lax stance on regulation.", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

It keeps personal DNA data in the hands of the individual \u2014 not big pharma \u2014 letting them choose if they want to share and monetize that data for research purposes.\nNebula is built on Blockstack and is driven by Ethereum smart contracts on the blockchain.\u00a0The Nebula ecosystem is fueled by the Nebula token, which is the currency by which individuals pay for their personal genome sequencing and related data. Meanwhile, data buyers use the tokens, which they can purchase with fiat currency, to acquire access to DNA data.\nBased on Professor Church\u2019s research, no other human genomics company even comes close to delivering on what Nebula Genomics can do \u2013\nNebula White Paper\nSolving a Biological Problem\nThere are a host of benefits to the genome sequencing process, not the least of which involves family planning.

However, since then, the market has struggled to maintain momentum, as bitcoin fell by more than $500 to $8,461 and Ethereum fell to $840.\n\nBriefly, earlier today, the price of Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, fell to $820, to a two-day low. Generally, the price trend of Ether has followed that of bitcoin over the past few weeks. As the price of bitcoin surpassed $9,000, Ether achieved $900 and as the price of bitcoin fell to $8,500, Ether fell to $850.\nOverall, the entire market has been following the trend of major cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and Ethereum, mostly because in periods of extreme volatility, cryptocurrencies with large market caps tend to operate as reserve currencies of the market.\nIn previous corrections, the cryptocurrency market recovered quickly because there was still hope among newcomers and casual investors that the market would rebound in the short-term. This correction has been significantly different to previous corrections. The media has reported more stories about investors losing money than optimistic developments within the cryptocurrency sector.\nSouth Korea in particular, which continued to show optimism throughout 2017, was hit with a bear market in recent weeks due to negative press.

This cycle has repeated itself ever since Mt. Gox\u00a0was breached in 2011. As anyone who follows the news knows, this trend is not exclusive to the crypto world. One journalist declared \u201c2017 Was The Year of Hacks.\u201d before predicting 2018 would get worse.\nCyber insurance historical data and projections from May of 2017.\nThis trend has led to the emergence of cyber insurance. In 2017 cyber insurance became the fastest growing type of insurance in the United States experiencing unprecedented growth in the double-digit percentages per year, in what was already a billion dollar market. This growth, combined with what are comparably\u00a0large premiums has led to an insurance gold rush in the area.\nAs with most other things\u00a0related to crypto, the cyber insurers\u2019 potential addition of blockchain has created tons of buzz. We\u2019ve previously reported on Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance\u2019s rollout of a small scale crypto insurance product in Japan. On a larger scale, we\u2019ve also discussed\u00a0 Coinbases\u2019 massive policy with Lloyds of London that covers the 2% of coins, which are not kept in \u201ccold storage\u201d. These policies are certainly the tip of what is becoming a fast-growing iceberg.\nAn Expansion of Cyberinsurance\nU.S. Cyber Insurance Market Grows Amid Data Breach Concerns (PRNewsFoto/Insurance Information Institute)\nWith all the insurance blockchain plays currently being launched, including one by insurance giant AIG, it\u2019s a bit surprising how old-fashioned\u00a0the crypto insurance market is. I have confidence an ICO or two will shake it up soon. In the meantime, the crypto insurance market seems to be almost an exact replica of the cyber insurance market. In 2016 AIG, Chubb and XL Group were reported as leading the Cyber insurance market. Today, AIG has already said they\u2019ve underwritten a few policies as part of an \u201cexploratory phase\u201d of what could be a much larger roll out. XL Caitlin and Chubb are also already selling crypto insurance.\nMuch like cyber insurance, the\u00a0crypto insurance market needs time to mature. More importantly, insurance providers need data to refine their underwriting models over the next few years. It\u2019s certainly going to be a long process and much like cyber insurance, it all starts with risk assessments. Companies will have to undergo months of due diligence\u00a0including extensive infrastructure reviews, third and (possibly) fourth party vendor security audits, and take expensive steps to ensure compliance with regulations surrounding data governance.\nObstacles Remain\nDespite some of these policies being sold now, questions remain. For one, classic cyber insurance policies rely on the stability of fiat currency. If there\u2019s\u00a0a $100 million stolen in a breach (excluding somewhat predictable legal fees, investigations\u2026) the maximum amount the insurance company can pay out is $100 million. If, however, Bitcoin was insured in January of 2016, insurance companies would have to deal with price increases in the thousands of percent. To address this, many insurance companies will insure based on value regardless of price fluctuations (in the case of gold, for instance). The constant readjustments can lead to dramatic fluctuations in premiums that can prove intolerable to insurance underwriters and their customers alike.\nAnother issue, in both cyber insurance and cryptoinsurance, is that of phishing scams. If an attack on a companies DNS leads to cryptocurrency being sent to the wrong wallet,\u00a0is the insurance company still liable? Shouldn\u2019t the customer have checked the SSL certificate to verify the identity of the server? All of these questions are being answered in cyber insurance and will have to be answered independently by the crypto insurance markets. Especially in light of the recent astronomic rise of phishing scams targeting crypto investors.\nDespite the risk, insurance companies seem to be getting into this industry. Crypto insurance is likely to form an increasingly large part of the crypto insurance market. Its growth has been and will continue to be exacerbated by frequent hacks. It\u2019ll be exciting to see where this industry ends up.", "category": "Banking"}

According to the white paper, Wabi is a \u201cdigital cryptocurrency which supports Walimai\u2019s anticounterfeit system and is backed by sales of products\u201d. Walimai, in turn, is a company founded in 2014 in the wake of counterfeit infant formula scandal which left 300,000 victims hospitalized or dead in China. The companies clear need for a blockchain to create a reliable product along with its practicality in the rapidly growing Chinese market has made it a HODL for many cryptocurrency investors.\nIndeed, the problem with Wabi has nothing to do with the product itself. The product is in active use around the world and has fueled revenue growth for Walimai through partner JD.com where consumers have given great feedback and shown a willingness to pay almost 20% more to make sure these products are safe. This traction is fantastic and has led to many-a-fundamental analysis praising the product.\nThe problem has nothing to do with the token itself. The problem with Wabi is the founding team\u2019s complete and utter disregard for their community and investors as well as a lack of focus on the part of their team. Wabi, unlike many other cryptocurrencies, has a founding team that operates as a corporation. It\u2019s been almost 4 years since Walamai\u2019s official founding and reportedly 6 since the founders started discussing the idea. Their corporate structure, strictly internal communications prior to press releases, and communication cadences are firmly entrenched and not well suited to the cryptocurrency market.\n\nCommunications to the community and investors are infrequent and result in concern from the community as to whether anything is happening internally, what stage they are at in initiatives that they had clear deadlines on, and whether anything is being done on the product at all. Take for instance the Wabi website. Prominent on the website is a timeline of the team\u2019s accomplishments. The timeline starts off in 2008 with the infant formula scandal and shows progress through September of 2017 where they show that the impressive milestone of \u201cFirst sales at physical baby stores\u201d was accomplished. However, their milestones after this date (coincidentally, also the date of the pre-sale) have been mute. The roadmap shows that milestones in November-December 2017 and December 2017 have not been completed yet.\nThis, combined with infrequent medium updates (compared to the weekly updated done by many other coins), and the failure to hit their self-proclaimed milestones causes me great concern.\nFinally, and this is my most concerning discovery, their tech team would seem to include 2 very busy people: \nThe first is Roman Tronenko, identified on their website as the Mobile Lead/Blockchain Architect. He seems extremely talented but appears to have executive positions at 4 different companies. He\u2019s a Founder/CTO at gogo.tattoo, an interesting project aiming to bring the blockchain to tattoos to ensure originality, connect clients with artists, and make portfolios permanent. He\u2019s also a Senior Mobile Engineer at italki, an online language learning platform that appears to have raised a $3,000,000 series A round. It\u2019s also purported to have 3 million users and 5,000 teachers. The companies LinkedIn says it has between 51-200 employees. Finally, he is the CTO at MDL, another interesting startup hoping to bring blockchain to talent sourcing. Their (Italki)\u00a0latest blog post was about two weeks after Wabi\u2019s. While this man is obviously extremely impressive, it causes one to wonder why he has so much on his plate. Is Wabi not lucrative enough? More importantly, why aren\u2019t they paying even a single full-time software developer after all the money they\u2019ve raised.\nThis brings us to our next developer, Dmitry Korzhik, who has another extraordinarily busy schedule. Dmitry is listed on Wabi\u2019s website as \u201cBlockchain Lead\u201d and on his own LinkedIn as \u201cBlockchain Development Engineer\u201d. Either way, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s supposed to be doing some of the programming onWalimai\u2019s array of products. This isn\u2019t the first role on his LinkedIn, however. According to his own LinkedIn his primary role is \u201cProduct Development\u201d at Rocket ICO, a pretty awesome online startup incubator and investment platform. This ICO has raised over $1 million and is looking to raise $10 million in their token sale. As if this weren\u2019t enough, Dmitry is also the \u201cChief Business Development Officer\u201d at a company called Mind development which I couldn\u2019t find much info on but apparently is a public company located in Minsk. Finally, he purports to be an IT Consultant at a company known as \u201cRadiation Instruments and New Components LLC\u201d which appears to be a company he set up to do consulting for engineering firms working on new projects. Once again, I have no doubt of this developers talents, but can\u2019t help but question if he\u2019s spread a little thin.\nFinally, we have Arthur Pinchuk the \u201cSoftware development team leader\u201d. In my experience, this doesn\u2019t usually mean he\u2019s writing any code but we\u2019ll include him here anyway. Much like Dmitry, Arthur\u2019s first role is not listed as Walimai but as the \u201cBoard Director for IT Strategy\u201d at Rocket ICO. \u00a0On this website, he\u2019s listed right next to our friend Dmitry Korzhik, who\u2019s listed as the \u201cHead of Product Development\u201d on the Rocket ICO website. On both websites, it sounds like he\u2019s not doing much coding at all.\nWabi\u2019s technical team concerns me. They\u2019ve got milestones to hit which closely involve their tech team and an app which has just \u201cpreviewed\u201d on WeChat but not been shipped yet (indicating there is still much work to do). The teams lack of focus is disconcerting in a market where speed seems to be everything and competitors are entering every day. Added to the dearth of dedicated engineering talent is the lack of outreach, failure to hit milestones, and general lack of focus.

Dublin-based Coinprism,\u00a0a wallet service founded in 2014 as an early blockchain startup, is closing down, according to an alert on the company\u2019s website. Both the Coinprism block explorer and the Coinprism API will be closed. According to the company, technology has evolved since their launch, making their offering obsolete in light of Ethereum ERC-20-based tokens, which drive many ICO tokens.\nUsers who hold funds in a Coinprism wallet are being advised by the startup to transfer their bitcoin and colored coins out of Coinprism and into another wallet \u2014 or export their private keys \u2014 by the end of the first quarter, according to an email obtained by CCN.\nCoinprism was a platform fueled by a colored bitcoin wallet for the trading of digital assets, founded by Flavien Charlon. In the email, Coinprism offers some solace to its users, reminding them that bitcoin and colored-coin funds are independent of the Coinprism platform and instead reside on the blockchain. As a result, they will not disappear alongside the Coinprism exchange.\nBut the bitcoin and colored-coin funds can\u2019t be accessed without the use of a private key, and as a result, Coinprism is imploring users to export them.\n\nCoinprism users should visit this page to begin the bitcoin export process\nNext, reimport them or \u201csweep them into a bitcoin-compatible wallet\u201d (the process similarly works for forked coins including bitcoin cash)\nTo keep color coin assets, you need an open-asset compatible wallet.

Speculators, professional investors, and even whole companies want in, and there\u2019s no sign that will be abating anytime soon. The increased interest is also leading to greater scrutiny, including from the United States Congress. \nFor all of the hype that suggests cryptos are the wave of the future for financial transactions, there remains a bit of a stigma attached to the space due to suspicions that cryptos have been used to finance illegal activities. Last May, representatives Kathleen Rice (D-NY) and Derek Kilmer (D-WA) introduced HR2433, a bill that aims to push the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate with other federal partners to conduct a threat assessment on virtual currencies. \nSpecifically, the bill called on the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis to examine \u201cthe threat posed by individuals using virtual currency to carry out activities in furtherance of an act of terrorism, including the provision of material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization.\u201d Upon completion, the DHS would be expected to share its findings with other law enforcement bodies at the federal, state, and local levels. \nIt has been suspected that terror network ISIS has been using Bitcoin to fund its activities. Last year, a 27-year-old Pakistani-Born US resident named Zombie Shahnaz was stopped by authorities as she attempted to board a flight bound for Pakistan. She was subsequently charged with bank fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, as it\u2019s alleged that she fraudulently obtained funds that were used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies online. Shahnaz was discovered to have made a number of strange wire transfers to vague entities and individuals located overseas. \n\u201cThese transactions were motivated to benefit ISIS, which the defendant ultimately sought to join in Syria,\u201d according to court documents. \nLast week, the US Senate held hearings on amending the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act via HB2825. One section of that bill contains language that\u2019s similar to HR2433, which successfully passed the House last year before being sent over to the Senate. No action was taken by the Senate since that point, so it appears that the threat assessment request has been absorbed into the broader DHS bill. Either way, it\u2019s clear that cryptos are on the radar of regulators, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see if the assessment sparks any changes.", "category": "News"}
{"title": "The Siacoin Question: To Fork or Not to Fork?", "url": "https://www.ccn.com/to-fork-or-not-to-fork-that-is-sias-question/", "birthday": "2018-02-11T19:15:51+00:00", "date": "2018-02-11 19:15:51", "year": 2018, "month": 2, "day": 11, "content": "Forks have been a hot topic recently due to the debates that they spark, and the potential for a new digital asset to come from contentious decisions.\nIn a recent turn of events, the Sia community has been undergoing a bit of internal debate regarding whether or not to deploy a soft-fork that would bolster ASIC mining competition outside of the umbrella of Nebulous \u2013 the managers of the Sia codebase.\nNebulous Expands into ASIC Manufacturing\nSia, the brain-child of David Vorick and Luke Champine, initially released back in 2015 as a means to decentralize file storage by offering individuals the ability to rent out their unused hard drive space for compensation. The technology featured file encryption against hosts wishing to view stored data, file redundancy by spreading data to a wide range of hosts, and smart contracts enabling payments between renters and hosts. The system protects itself against malicious actors by deploying a Proof-of-Work consensus that attracted plenty of GPU-miners.\nOn June 19th, Sia teased their community by releasing what appeared to be a company logo with the text \u201cObelisk. Coming soon.\u201d Just a few days later, Nebulous announced their plans to enter the ASIC manufacturing world, specifically through Sia ASICs created by their latest subsidiary named Obelisk. They began their initial pre-sale\u00a0and had a date pegged for their first shipment to be sent sometime before Summer 2018.\nBitmain Crashes the Party\nUnbeknownst to the entire Sia community and Nebulous, ASIC manufacturer Bitmain was slowly working in the background to build a miner dedicated to Sia. Bitmain announced the sales and shipment of them on Twitter before Obelisk\u2019s miners were able to hit the market potentially this quarter.\nVorick was quick to respond to this move, by reminding the community of Bitmain\u2019s actions in the past, and alerting them to a potential card up their sleeve: a soft-fork that would invalidate any ASIC other than Obelisk\u2019s own.\nWe did add an extra feature to the SC1 unit that would allow us to invalidate the Bitmain hardware without invalidating the SC1. The community would need to choose to adopt a soft-fork (it\u2019s not something we could just magically activate, we have to change the hashing algorithm slightly), and then we could get rid of this cycle of Bitmain hardware.\nHowever, Vorick did mention that he believes that a soft-fork isn\u2019t in Sia\u2019s best interests, but the team would act if Bitmain were to attack the network. He closed the remarks by assuring the community that Sia is not \u201cin trouble,\u201d and then opened the debate up to allow the community to respond to the situation.\nHash Power, New Players, and a Contingency Plan\nAfter Vorick\u2019s scrutiny, Bitmain immediately went on the offensive and opened up a pool branch on Antpool for Sia. They flexed their muscles by quickly jumping to over 200 TH/s before calming things down. At the time of writing, Antpool\u2019s hashrate is around 3% of the Sia network. Siamining currently controls the hashrate majority with ~68%.\nWhat the Sia community and Bitmain didn\u2019t expect was another manufacturer capitalizing on the current drama by entering the playing field.\nASIC manufacturing company Halong Mining also announced a Sia ASIC miner of their own, boasting speeds of 3.33TH. However, the community remained a bit skeptical considering that an image hasn\u2019t been uploaded of the actual product on their website, and the fact that Halong has yet to deliver on their sha256 miners.\nThe community began to get nervous over the next wave of competition quickly entering the scene, and discussions of forking continued to brew at an increased rate on both the Sia Subreddit and Discord channel.\nA Reddit user by the name of /u/slowtoaster took matters into their own hands by announcing a fork that would maintain compatibility with all ASIC miners if the Sia team decided to render their competition obsolete. However, the semantics of the announcement seemed as though the Reddit user was looking to capitalize on the potential to profit off of a new coin rather than have it be an initiative for the community, as the post leaned toward exchange support first rather than the necessity of the contention.\nThe Community Responds\nAn open letter penned by members of the Sia community surfaced six days after the events began rolling, detailing the situation from a protectionist standpoint. The letter leaned toward supporting the soft-fork option posed, which would invalidate Bitmain\u2019s hardware and other ASIC manufacturer hardware outside of Obelisk\u2019s.\nThe letter also detailed the fact that if Bitmain released their miners just a month earlier, a scheduled hard-fork would\u2019ve activated sooner than expected, leading to potential network issues. Although this in and of itself alleviates Bitmain partially of malicious intent, the Sia community had every right to question their motives due to the number of controversies surrounding the company.\nIn their drive to maximize profits, they externalize costs to blockchain communities. However, communities are not obliged to accept this. Already, the Sia community is concerned with the prospect of Bitmain behaving maliciously by either mining enough empty blocks to disrupt the Sia network or by performing a 51% attack.\nThe petition campaign included with the letter has since received 261 signatures, and is calling for the fork activation in order to protect the network from any potential attacks from Bitmain. The campaign implores potential signees to first read the open letter before making any decisions in order to paint a picture of the current conflict.\nSia Responds \u2013 Fork as a Last Resort\nJust two days later, Zack Herbert, VP of Operations at Sia, penned his own response to the community letter, as well as the situation at hand. The letter states that the company isn\u2019t in favor of a soft-fork which would invalidate Bitmain\u2019s hardware, simply because it would be a \u201ccentralized, monopolistic move\u201d which went against the ideology of the project.\nThe team recognizes Bitmain as a \u201cbad actor,\u201d and leaves their motives in the general realm of working to \u2018undermine\u2019 projects they get involved with. The team also took a shot at Bitmain\u2019s infamous \u2018Antbleed,\u2019 which was a backdoor built into their miners in order to keep tabs on their customers and potentially compromise rival operations. They did,\u00a0in fact, point A3 owners toward \u201cfriendly pools\u201d for mining such as Luxor and SiaMining to keep the network protected.\nWe are trying to build a storage layer for the internet. And we therefore cannot afford to damage our reputation and split the community when we are this young.\nOne of the more striking notes \u2013 also highlighted by a majority of readers on the article \u2013 let the community know that the Sia team will,\u00a0in fact, soft-fork to invalidate Bitmain\u2019s hardware if they take any action to \u201charm\u201d the project. This action would exist outside of any form of consensus, leaving the custodians of the project to decide its fate rather than the community. This also meant that the situation of whether or not the community would fork the project rested on the community\u2019s shoulders alone, as Sia took a step back from the potential update.\nTo Fork or Not to Fork\nWhether or not Sia is to undergo the fork to invalidate other ASIC miners still isn\u2019t clear, but the internal team has drawn their line in the sand by threatening to deploy only if Bitmain was to attack the network. The team\u2019s decision to err on the side of caution when it came to a fork to bolster their competition is a nod to the merits of competition in the space, and keeping decentralized systems decentralized.\nIn this case, it will truly be up to the community to decide the fate of the fork. With enough hashpower, development, and exchange support, anything is possible.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

If you\u2019re using Bitcoin to send a remittance from one country to another, there\u2019s a good chance that the price movement over the period of one block confirmation (how long it takes the blockchain to include your transaction) will be larger than the fees charged by Western Union or PayPal.\u201d\nThe outstanding problem, however, is that no team has been able to develop a universally accepted stablecoin that does not compromise features of security or decentralization.\nThere are a few companies in the space making headway. For example, the TrueCoin Project is building a USD-backed stablecoin that is 100 percent collateralized, legally protected and transparently audited. The team comes out of Stanford, Palantir and Google; its backers include Founders Fund Angel, Stanford\u2019s StartX and Blocktower Capital. TrueCoin has developed a legal framework for collateralized cryptocurrencies in collaboration with Cooley and Arnold & Porter, and has a growing network of fiduciary, compliance and banking partners.\nThe TrueCoin project offers a much-needed alternative to Tether, a USD-backed stablecoin that has grown to over $1.5 billion but is widely distrusted by crypto exchanges and traders. Tether holds their fiat currency in a centralized bank account and does not offer legal protection for token holders. TrueCoin\u2019s solution offers transparent monthly auditing, 100 percent collateral in USD and enforceable legal rights for token holders, enabling the first trustworthy USD-backed stable coin. This is a massive upgrade for financial stakeholders who seek stability in cryptocurrencies.\nTrueCoin leverages trusts to provide certificates of ownership of USD in a real set of bank accounts. Trusts are extremely flexible and robust financial vehicles that are often subject to daily auditing and complete legal protection for token holders under trust law. Serving as a more secure, distributed substitute for a single central bank account, trusts will empower near-instantaneous exchanges between tokens and fiat currencies, enabling real-world utilization.\nThrough TrueUSD, \u201cusers have access to a growing network of trust accounts, each managed by distinct professional fiduciaries. As users add or redeem USD in each trust account, the account will mint or destroy the corresponding tokens.\u201d Thus, this innovative stablecoin can scale up by adding more bank accounts without increasing counterparty risk.\nStablecoins could quickly become the universally accepted, international currency of the future. They have the potential to empower everyone to take part in an evolving crypto-economy, without compromising security and freedom. If implemented at scale, they are poised to become a foundational component of the next-generation economy.\nIt will be interesting to see how different teams take on this technical and operational challenge of scaling up a stablecoin.", "category": "News"}

However, she said that the prevalence of cryptocurrencies demonstrated that an \u201centity-based\u201d regulatory framework is not sufficient and that the IMF and other regulators must take an \u201cactivity-based\u201d approach to supervising cryptocurrency usage.\n\u201cI believe that it\u2019s inevitable,\u201d Lagarde said of cryptocurrency regulation. \u201cWe clearly have to move into an activity-based regulation. Forget about the entities, work on the activities themselves: who does what and who is licensed to do what and who is properly regulated and supervised.\u201d\nThis statement is the latest development in Lagarde\u2019s pivot from dismissing blockchain technology out of hand to diagnosing it as a threat to the global financial establishment.\nIn 2015, Lagarde told an audience of bankers that they did not need to worry about Bitcoin and poked fun at those who expressed concern about it.\nBy last year, however, she was warning that cryptocurrencies could bring \u201cmassive disruptions\u201d and that bankers \u201cit may not be wise to dismiss virtual currencies.\u201d\nLately, Lagarde has begun latching onto cryptocurrency\u2019s negative associations, trumpeting its perceived use in illicit transactions and the large amount of electricity that miners consume.\nThis negative public stance has coincided with a coordinated IMF push intended to promote an international framework for cryptocurrency regulation \u2014 a proposal that has been embraced by a variety of financial regulators from G20 nations.", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

We think it\u2019s a better gold if you look at the properties of money. And what makes gold gold? Scarcity. Bitcoin is actually fixed in supply so it\u2019s better than scarce \u2026 it\u2019s more portable, its fungible, it\u2019s more durable. It sort of equals a better gold across the board,\u201d Winklevoss said during a CNBC-sponsored forum at the Milken Institute\u2019s MENA Summit last Wednesday.\nBased on this assessment, he said that Bitcoin could end up with a market capitalization similar to that of gold, which is currently valued at $7 trillion. Bitcoin, he predicted has a \u201cpotential appreciation of 30 to 40 times,\u201d which would set the Bitcoin price above $320,000 and result in a circulating market cap of at least $4 trillion.\nThis, Winklevoss said, made Bitcoin\u2019s recent correction an attractive buying opportunity:\n\u201cSo if you look at a $100 billion market cap today, now last week it might have been more like 200, so it\u2019s actually a buying opportunity, we think that there\u2019s a potential appreciation of 30 to 40 times because you look at the gold market today, it\u2019s a $7 trillion market. And so a lot of people are starting to see that, they recognize the store of value properties. So we think regardless of the price moves in the last few weeks, it\u2019s still a very underappreciated asset.\u201d\nOf course, the Winklevoss Capital co-founder cautioned that this transfer of capital will not take place overnight but could come to fruition within the next 10 to 20 years.\nCriticisms Just a \u2018Failure of the Imagination\u2019\nHis brother, Tyler, agreed with Cameron\u2019s assessment that Bitcoin would disrupt gold, adding that he believes cryptocurrencies will ultimately replace fiat currency as the primary medium of exchange for machine-to-machine transactions.\n\u201cCryptocurrencies aren\u2019t really important for human-to-human transactions,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when machines-to-machines trade economic value, they are going to plug into protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\u201d\nHe explained that, given the multitudinous applications of this technology, most critical analyses from Bitcoin skeptics are baseless.\n\u201cYou know the criticisms [of Bitcoin] are just a failure of the imagination,\u201d he concluded.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Meanwhile, JPMorgan\u2019s CEO Jamie Dimon, whose distaste-turned-disinterest in bitcoin made headlines for months, hopefully\u00a0ok\u2019d\u00a0the resources to create the bitcoin manual. Otherwise, someone\u2019s job could be on the line.\nThe bitcoin bible, which is comprised of 71-pages of crypto, covers topics ranging from the technology of bitcoin to its use cases, not to mention the hurdles that it faces. Meanwhile, JPMorgan analysts have issued their own report saying conditions are ripe for the BTC price to fall to $4,605, which would reflect nearly a 50% drop from its current level of $8,727.\nBitcoin Bible\nPerhaps the most revelatory finding in the bitcoin bible is the bank\u2019s realization that cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t going anywhere. They write:\n\u201cCCs are unlikely to disappear completely and could easily survive in varying forms and shapes among players who desire greater decentralization, peer-to-peer networks, and anonymity, even as the latter is under threat.\u201d\nThe bitcoin bible also pointed to cryptocurrencies as a point of diversification for investment portfolios, providing a non-correlated asset to stocks and bonds, for instance. This point of view could bolster cryptocurrencies into the retirement market, such as 401(k) plans in the United States, or at least further the conversation.\nThe hurdles, they say, surround bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies competing with fiat based currencies, pointing to the euro and the yuan as some of its stiffest competition. And if you argue bitcoin more as a store of value than as a currency by which to spend, the argument loses some of its luster.\nLess surprising is their acceptance of the blockchain, which Dimon himself has touted as \u201creal\u201d and whose technology is increasingly permeating the bank\u2019s internal divisions. JPMorgan in the bitcoin bible points to the merits of distributed ledger technology for accelerating cross-border payments, pointing to \u201creward tokens or funding systems for other blockchain innovations and the internet of things.\u201d\nAnalyst Warning\nMeanwhile, despite the rosy report on bitcoin, JPMorgan analysts also issued a wake-up call in the form of technical analysis, warning investors that the BTC price is headed for a drop of enormous\u00a0proportions, to the $4,605 level from its current price of more than $8,700, reflecting a drop of almost 50%.\n\u201cThe question is whether we go there straight away, indicated on a failure to clear 10128 and 10776, or at a later stage after a stronger countertrend rally,\u201d according to the analyst report cited in Business Insider.\nBut JPMorgan analysts, which remain \u201cimpressed\u201d by the bitcoin price\u2019s recovery from its recent doldrums, suggest that bitcoin\u2019s fate is only sealed if it doesn\u2019t break through its current resistance noted in the above range. If it can do that, the bitcoin price could recover back to a range of $14,334 to $16,304.\nMixed Signals\nIt\u2019s not the first time that JPMorgan has sent mixed signals both to Wall Street and the crypto community on bitcoin. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan chief executive famously called bitcoin a fraud back in September before having a change of heart. He later expressed remorse, with his feelings on the topic advancing from intolerance to no interest.\nJPMorgan also addressed institutional capital, most of which remains sidelined from cryptocurrencies, as a signal to watch for cryptocurrencies making their way into the mainstream.\u00a0 Hedge funds comprise the lion\u2019s share of the 175 cryptocurrency funds in the market, but assets under management have yet to surpass the low-billion-dollar threshold.", "category": "Banking"}

By the end of the day, Bitcoin would plunge below $6,000 for the first time since November, leaving Bitcoin bears gleefully predicting the flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s imminent demise.\nThat, of course, did not happen, and the Bitcoin price soon reversed trajectory and began to mount a recovery.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $8,703 on Bitfinex, which was in line with the coin\u2019s global average.\nThe Partial Return of the Kimchi Premium\nOne reason for Bitcoin\u2019s recent recoveryThe global Bitcoin price has been bolstered in recent weeks by the return of moderate premiums at South Korean exchanges. The so-called \u201cKimchi Premium,\u201d which had once priced cryptoassets as much as 25 or 30 percent above equivalent values on Western exchanges, had largely disappeared at the beginning of February following the implementation of new restrictions intended to cool the country\u2019s heated local markets.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nIncluded in these new rules was a prohibition on anonymous trading, which meant that all traders had to undergo KYC verification before they could resume trading. Many traders were slow to do this, perhaps because consumer interest had tapered in response to the recent market correction. However, BTC/KRW volume has gradually increased over the past two weeks as traders have verified their accounts and re-entered the markets, and this increased volume has been accompanied by a slight return of the Kimchi Premium.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

After Japan passed legislation recognizing bitcoin as a legal method of payment, new laws also mandated new cryptocurrency operators to register with the FSA. However, Coincheck was exempt from complying with the rules since it was operating before the mandated law kicked in.\nFollowing the hack, Coincheck announced a plan to compensate some 260,000 NEM holders victimized by the hack, a claim which was checked upon by the FSA during a subsequent on-site inspection of the Tokyo-based exchange.\nThe theft saw Japan\u2019s finance minister demand the FSA to better supervise cryptocurrency exchanges in order to prevent customer losses. \u201cWe will appropriately weigh the balance between promotion of innovation and protection of users in (supervising) cryptocurrency exchanges,\u201d finance minister Taro Aso said last week.\nThe FSA has been listening and is now set to begin spot checks of a number of exchanges. There are legitimate concerns of other exchanges using lax security standards. The Nikkei report points to multiple exchanges returning \u2018vague details\u2019 when asked to return information on systems used in customers\u2019 asset management, corporate governance, and security. More than one of the presumably 16 exchanges operating without regulatory oversight was discovered managing assets \u2018in an insufficiently secure manner.\u2019\nA lack of experts employed by cryptocurrency exchanges, specifically in internal auditing and cybersecurity, could see the FSA introduce disciplinary penalties for operators continuing to function without robust security measures.", "category": "Exchanges"}

In front of a packed house at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit for Crypto in New York on Wednesday, Garlinghouse spoke with his former employer\u00a0about his payments startup Ripple and XRP, the digital coin in which Ripple holds a 61% stake and which advanced a whopping 32,000% in 2017. He also revealed he is long BTC.\n\nGarlinghouse used the forum to announce that payments startup Ripple just signed LianLian, Chain\u2019s No. 4 payments provider, to its blockchain-fueled\u00a0xCurrent platform for cross-border real-time e-commerce payments.\nHe expounded on cross-border payments, humorously pointing out that before Ripple\u2019s xCurrent, to get \u00a310,000 from New York to London on the same day, the fastest way would be heading to nearby Newark Airport and flying the money there. \u201cxCurrent\u00a0enables real-time messaging and settlement between banks,\u201d he said.\nGarlinghouse pointed to what he characterized as a \u201cmisunderstanding about digital assets\u201d that pervasive today, giving an example from the dot-com era that can be applied to today\u2019s cryptocurrency environment. He recalled how in his earlier days when he worked in telecom, he visited with then-SBC Communications executive Randall Stephenson, who today is at the helm at AT&T.\nBack at the turn of the century, Stephenson told Garlinghouse that SBC would never use IP for voice traffic. \u201cThe point was, he said they had a robust analog switch network that worked for voice brilliantly\u201d and that they invest in data. Garlinhgouse pointed out that today, there is no voice network at AT&T \u2014 it\u2019s all VoIP.\n\u201cI think the same thing will happen in\u00a0banking. People who are invested in us love xCurrent but they\u2019re not sure about xRapid\u00a0(Ripple\u2019s product for liquidity.) I can hear the echo chamber of Randall Stephenson,\u201d he said, adding he views xRapid as a crawl-walk-run product, pointing to the four current users that include payment providers MoneyGram and Mercury. \u201cI think it\u2019s just the beginning,\u201d he said.\nOverall he believes that the Congressional hearing that unfolded earlier this week on regulation and events such as Yahoo\u2019s are signs of maturation within the cryptocurrency market.\n\u201cFor me, it feels like 1997 and the birth of the internet when I was a young whippersnapper in Silicon Valley,\u201d said Garlinghouse, adding: \u201cRegulators are behaving as they should to make sure we have regulation around KYL and AML. There are reasons for that. If exchanges are trying to circumvent KYC requirements, [regulators] should come in and enforce that.\u201d\nGarlinghouse on BTC\nMeanwhile, though Garlinghouse is long bitcoin personally, saying he is not of the came that \u201cBTC dies some terrible death.\u201d He doesn\u2019t, however, see it solving the world\u2019s payments problems, saying: \u201cXRP is 1,000 times faster and cheaper than a bitcoin transaction. Are you going to use a fraction of BTC to buy a cup of coffee? It will take hours to complete the transaction. Your coffee\u2019s gonna get cold,\u201d he joked.\nGarlinghouse on JPMorgan\nRipple is a payments\u00a0company that focuses on cross-border transactions, a market that\u2019s largely powered by SWIFT for global banks. But as Garlinghouse points out, only a small number of banks dominate SWIFT and extract billions of dollars of profits from the rest of the banks in the interim.\n\u201cAsk why Jamie Dimon is saying things [he said about bitcoin],\u201d said Garlinghouse, pointing to Citi, HSBC and Chase at the top of SWFT. \u201cThey are making a lot of money from other banks. We talk to banks, and 99.9% of them want Ripple to be successful because they\u2019re sick of paying these guys,\u201d he said.\nEarly Innings\nIn conclusion, Garlinghouse gave his view of the industry, which he says remains in the \u201cadolescent stage.\u201d It\u2019s incredibly important for him and for the success of Ripple for the industry to mature, including media coverage. Meanwhile, he doesn\u2019t view other blockchain startups as competitors.\n\u201cA lot of them go after different use cases, like\u00a0 the early days of the internet. Yahoo is not competing with Amazon. The internet needed to grow up. I want all businesses to rise. An important element of a mature industry is a maturation of all aspects of coverage,\u201d he said.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

Goldman Sachs doesn\u2019t think so.\nWriting in a report dated Feb. 5, Goldman Sachs head of investment research Steve Strongin said that \u2014 contrary to the market\u2019s historic movements \u2014 individual cryptoasset price swings should be less correlated to one another moving forward.\nThis, he said, spells doom for cryptocurrencies that do not emerge as clear winners in what should become a \u201cfew-winners-take-most\u201d market:\n\u201cThe high correlation between the different cryptocurrencies worries me,\u201d Strongin said, according to a Bloomberg report. \u201cBecause of the lack of intrinsic value, the currencies that don\u2019t survive will most likely trade to zero.\u201d\nStrongin stressed that it\u2019s possible that one or a few of the currently-existent cryptocurrencies could emerge from the so-called \u201cspeculative bubbles\u201d as the crypto-equivalents of Amazon and Google, but he said that it\u2019s unlikely that most coins will ever recover to their recent all-time highs.\n\u201cAre any of today\u2019s cryptocurrencies going to be an Amazon or a Google, or will they end up like many of the now-defunct search engines? Just because we are in a speculative bubble does not mean current prices can\u2019t increase for a handful of survivors,\u201d Strongin said. \u201cAt the same time, it probably does mean that most, if not all, will never see their recent peaks again.\u201d\nThis, of course, supposes that the \u201cspeculative bubble\u201d is nearing its endpoint and that investors will begin to judge cryptocurrencies on their individual merits, rather than as a collective asset class, as many casual retail investors are wont to do. It would also seem to assume that the initial coin offering (ICO) boom will flame out rather than continue to expand.\nIn any case, the \u201cwinners-take-most\u201d view of the market is not unique to Goldman Sachs. Digital Currency Group (DCG) founder Barry Silbert made a similar comment on Wednesday at Yahoo Finance\u2019s All Markets Summit: Crypto, although with an understandably more optimistic outlook on the industry as a whole.\nSilbert said that the vast majority of cryptoassets face a binary outcome \u2014 they will either become incredibly valuable or they will become worthless. This, he said, is why DCG portfolio company Grayscale Investments launched its latest product, a cryptoasset investment fund that holds market cap-weighted positions in the five largest crptocurrencies and rebalances quarterly to reflect market movements.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

However, this isn\u2019t enough for Maduro who now wants an OPEC-backed global cryptocurrency. Could it work and is there support within OPEC?\nThe President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, wants OPEC support for Venezuela\u2019s new \u2018state-backed\u2019 cryptocurrency offering which has been called \u201cthe Petro\u201d. This new cryptocurrency is backed by Venezuelan oil supplies and is pre-mined.\nHe stated:\n\u201cI am going to officially propose to all OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries that we adopt a joint cryptocurrency mechanism backed by oil.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s Being Proposed?\nMaduro has started informal discussions with OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The organization is made up of 14 oil producing nations, headquartered in Vienna, Austria, and includes Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Algeria, Nigeria and Iran as members.\nThe rudimentary outline of Maduro\u2019s offer seems to support a \u201cjoint cryptocurrency mechanism\u201d that would be supported by OPEC nations, with the windfall being distributed throughout OPEC member states. The move is seen, within Venezuelan circles, as a functional way of ending the on-going economic crisis that is ravaging the nation. As hyperinflation continues, the demand for hard currency to alleviate food shortages and social problems grows. As reported previously, Maduro\u2019s representatives have already pitched the \u2018petro\u2019 to officials in Qatar, luring the oil-reach Middle Eastern state with discounts to buy into the cryptocurrency.\nThe \u201cPetro\u201d initial coin offering is a purposeful way for the Venezuelan government to access international cash markets outside of the normal financial systems \u2013 currently embargoed courtesy of United States sanctions.\nThe US Treasury has responded to the circumvention: \u201cThe petro digital currency would appear to be an extension of credit to the Venezuelan government \u2026 [and] could, therefore, expose US persons to legal risk.\u201d\nAs a pre-mined cryptocurrency, the \u201cPetro\u201d will have 100 million units released on February 20th. This will be divided between a whole raft of different stakeholders \u2013 with 38.4 million being released with serious early investor discounting to help nurture uptake.\nWhy Is Venezuela Supporting The \u201cPetro\u201d?\nThe Government hopes diverse exchanges support the \u201cPetro\u201d and the policy is to allow multi-currency exchanges which mean investors won\u2019t be forced to exchange dollars into Bolivars to buy the \u201cPetro\u201d cryptocurrency.\nWhether or not OPEC decides to support the scheme is another issue altogether. OPEC, whilst prudently enjoying the proceeds that comes from a global oil price cartel aren\u2019t that united in regard to global economic policy \u2013 especially cryptocurrency policymaking.\nNigeria, an OPEC member, stated that Bitcoin was a \u201cgamble\u201d. However, Iraq has started exploring cryptocurrencies because of rampant inflationary pressures on their own domestic fiat-backed currency. There isn\u2019t unanimity in regard to cryptocurrency usage within OPEC member states.\nTherefore, Maduro\u2019s posturing might just be that \u2013 posturing. OPEC\u2019s diverse membership, who have divergent views on cryptocurrencies within the domain of their own national policymaking, might not support a functional OPEC-backed cryptocurrency on the same grounds.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

Berkley\u2019s local government leaders are exploring the potential of an ICO, backed by a local government bond, to help raise necessary funds to help re-build low-cost housing in Berkley whilst improving inequality and social fairness.\nBerkeley\u2019s Historic Past\nEver since the \u201cFree Speech Movement\u201d protests, which became a central cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for liberalism in the United States, reverberated throughout the University of California, Berkley campus and the associated City, free speech has been strongly allied with this Californian Liberal hinterland.\nThe City\u2019s long and illustrious history surrounding the liberal causes has attracted great support and condemnation \u2013 non-more vocal than the US President, Donal Trump. Berkley is America\u2019s first \u201cSanctuary City\u201d. The anti-migrant crackdown by the US President\u2019s administration has put Berkley in the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s crosshairs!\nSanctuary Cities are city districts that allow immigrants, especially illegal immigrants, access to the cities resources so they can play an active, safe and fulfilling part within that city. The purpose of which is to end illegal immigrant abuses. The municipal policy is to limit the full scope of federal government collaboration on immigration issues in order to protect immigrant families from breakup or deportation.\nFederal Funding Woes\nPresident Trump\u2019s plans to remove funding for sanctuary cities along with wider budget cuts has created a problem within Berkley \u2013 one that is centrally linked to housing. If Trump does pull funding from the University of Berkley and other Berkley organizations, the City could lose nearly half a billion dollars in funding. Terry Hartle, Senior VP for the American Council on Education stated:\n\u201cThere is currently no federal law that would allow the federal government to deny funding to an institution of higher education because they prohibited someone from speaking on campus,\u201d\nHowever, as Bloomberg noted, Trump, singularly as President, cannot cut Berkeley\u2019s funding as it would require Congressional oversight and legislation. However, there are structural problems within the city. The cryptocurrency ICO announcement is a fluid response to the crisis of affordable housing.\nBerkeley\u2019s Housing Crisis\nBerkeley has structural policy problems that have helped to nurture the current crisis within its own housing stock. Proposition 13, which was passed in 1978, \u201clocked-in\u201d value for long-term tenants. This created a problem whereby homeowners could be \u2018asset\u2019 millionaires but unable to sell. The tax implications aside, there is generally a lack of affordable development.\nBerkeley\u2019s locale to San Francisco\u2019s tech community \u2013 notably Google and other tech giants \u2013 has helped to increase value. California has long had an above average house price market. However, the income generated from tech in the 90s and 00s created a structural housing shortage. The inability to build low-income homes, due to developers focusing on servicing the wealthier section of the market has compounded the wider issue. This housing development issue is compounded by an affordability crisis. These two competing pressures are the problematic foundations of the recent ICO affordability solution announcement.\nIs Crypto Berkeley\u2019s Building Blocks For Success?\nCouncillor Ben Bartlett, the Council\u2019s senior strategist for this project, has stated: \u201cIt\u2019s actually enabling us to fulfil our duty as a government. Our duty is to provide for our people. It\u2019s a violation of that duty to allow people to sleep in the streets.\u201d\nThe move would see Berkeley raise much-needed capital to invest in low-income developments and other key projects through the sale of digital tokens \u2013 cryptocurrency-based assets. The plans are still embryonic. It is not known whether the project is mined or pre-mined. There is also uncertainty around the exchange-based and wallet-based deployment of the currency in terms of digital transactions and security.\nWhilst the project is in the developmental stage, councilors in Berkeley have partnered with the City Mayor, Jesse Arreguin, along with a tech startup called Neighborly \u2013 with software engineering support from Berkeley\u2019s UC Blockchain Laboratory \u2013 to develop the technology and platform. The goal is to offer an \u201cInitial Community Offering\u201d that would promote transactions within the local area. This blockchain-based municipal borrowing format would revolutionize local funding in the US and beyond.\nThe Future?\nThe proposed scheme requires democratic oversight by councilors and as such fundamental approval by the majority. The proposed scheme could start becoming a reality by mid-May 2018 when the council meet to discuss the project further. As Trump\u2019s attacks become more public, as the affordability constraints become more real, as more people fall beneath the city\u2019s support nets in Berkeley, and as homelessness rises; this could be the right funding model for societal change.\nThe scheme allows for Berkley to build on blockchain to provide its citizenry with homes fit for human habitation, that are affordable and accessible, based on a bespoke Berkeley UC/City bond scheme, that could create a low-to-middle income economic boost in the area.

The slowness of transactions was also cited.\nOne Russian dark web user released a statement advising vendors they had to find an alternative to bitcoin to keep his business.\nThe average transactions in the underground economy begin at between $50 and $300. Speed of payment is important on the dark web, as delays increase the risk of being cheated.\nThe prospect of having to wait up to 24 hours to confirm transactions, along with high payment fees, has rendered bitcoin payments unusable for many dark web users.\nAlso read: Litecoin to complement bitcoin as payments currency: founder Charlie Lee\nPoll Finds No User Consensus\nA poll of several hundred members on a criminal forum found there was no agreement on which coin to adopt.\nThe poll revealed the following coin preferences: Monero, 21.82%, Dash, 20.61%, Ether, 19.39%, Litecoin, 15.15%, bitcoin, 13.33% and Bitcoin Cash, 9.7%.\nDuring the next 12 months, Recorded Future found bitcoin remained the most frequently used coin, followed by Litecoin.

As reported by CCN, they dared the CEO to short bitcoin, since he believed the market was going to fail in the long run. DImon has since revealed he regrets his bitcoin \u2018fraud\u2019 remark, although he remains uninterested in the cryptocurrency.\nTo the Winklevoss twins, the negativity these Wall Street personalities show is a \u201cfailure of the imagination.\u201d Cameron Winklevoss even added that millennials would rather have software over hardware on their portfolios, referring to bitcoin as software and gold as hardware.\nWhen asked to clarify if they meant the critics are \u201ctoo old\u201d to understand cryptocurrencies, Tyler stated that as people get older their brain loses plasticity, which makes them end up wedded to the framework they have, Then, hinting they suffer from the mere-exposure effect, a psychological phenomenon by which they tend to start preferring things because of familiarity, he said:\n\u201cYou enter this world and you\u2019re taught money is this thing that\u2019s green, or it\u2019s this precious metal, and you start confusing what\u2019s familiar or what you use as what\u2019s real or the way things have to be. It\u2019s also a framework that\u2019s been embedded in, burned into your brain for let\u2019s say 65-70 years and maybe in some of these cases, examples, you\u2019re talking about 80 years\u201d\nAdding to that, he said it is hard to unlearn or think about something new for those individuals, as to them \u201cthe status quo is really good.\u201d There are, however, many people in the world with no access to a bank account, and to him bitcoin\u2019s critics are a \u201cprivileged minority.\u201d\nCurrent Payments System Is Broken\nHe further asked if there was a JP Morgan branch opening up in Africa to bank the unbanked, and added that the current payments system is broken. Cryptocurrencies are to the twins a way to fix it, as they allow for fast, peer-to-peer transactions.\nTo prove his point, the Winklevoss brother said that the \u201cbiggest joke is the fastest way to get money from NY to London is to jump on a plane with a bag of cash.\u201d Wiring a payment on a Friday night, he added, means the money won\u2019t get to its destination until Tuesday.\n\u201cImagine if your email was only open from 9 a.m. to 5 a.m., Monday to Friday. You might actually be happy about it because you get some sanity back but it\u2019s ridiculous that money doesn\u2019t work the way email does. All of a sudden with bitcoin and these cryptocurrencies it can and that\u2019s really the possibilities.\u201d\nThe Winklevoss twins\u2019 comments come at a time in which Goldman Sachs claims most cryptocurrencies \u201cwill never see recent peaks again,\u201d and in which European Central Bank president Mario Draghi admits European banks could soon hold bitcoin.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

The dapp held the number one spot on the charts for much of Wednesday.\nWhat Is It?\nEtherbots is the next digital gaming craze to sweep the cryptosphere. Despite the fact that the game has yet to launch, more ethers are being exchanged for Etherbots than CryptoKitties right now.\nIt\u2019s what\u2019s hot right now. But don\u2019t assume it\u2019s just a craze. Etherbots attracts users thanks to the same two basic principles that CryptoKitties embraces:\n\nScarcity\nComplete ownership of digital assets\n\nBeyond creating value and providing true ownership of digital characters, Etherbots adds in meaningful gameplay and competition to the mix. Bots compete against each other in battles. Bots win and lose based on the decisions of users.\nBuy parts, build bots and upgrade the attributes. Compete against others and increase the value of the bots.\nBuilding The Buzz\nEtherbots is only selling 3,900 bots during the pre-sale, but the creators aren\u2019t telling anyone when that number will be reached. The bot sale ends in six days. The price of buying a bot and participating in the ecosystem also goes up every time a new user purchases.\nOutside of the obvious scarcity built into the sale of bots, there\u2019s a 500% greater chance your bot \u2018crate\u2019 contains a rare shadow or legendary gold item over post-launch purchases. This is how Etherbots is gaining steam. The question is, will it be enough to permanently outperform the transaction volume of CryptoKitties?\nShooting For The Moon\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that one of the first ever CryptoKitties on the market sold for 131 ether tokens. At the time those tokens were worth over $63,000 USD.\nThe popularity of these virtual cats is responsible for over $12 million in sales to end 2017. The kitties are also responsible for slowing down for the Ethereum network.\nEtherbots will undoubtedly do the same thing if the valuations associated with this virtual game explode.\nThat said, Ethereum\u2019s community of programmers aims to implement a scalability upgrade, Casper, in 2018. It just might make virtual gaming frenzies a lot easier to stomach for the network.\nIf that happens, Etherbots\u2019 take off may take off even faster than its kitten companion.\nEither way, it looks like more and more ether holders will be battling for robot upgrades in a big way.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The platform operates under a provision in the 2012 JOBS Act, which places funding restrictions on startups but allows non-accredited investors to contribute up to $10,000 to a securities offering.\nSo far, Indiegogo\u2019s ICO platform has hosted only one token launch, that belonging to the Fan-Controlled Football League (FCFL), which plans to create a professional football league where fans can use tokens to vote on in-game and managerial decisions such as which plays teams should run and what players the team should draft. The FCFL token sale proved to be a success, and it hit its $5 million funding cap in about 10 days.\nDespite the success of this pilot, Indiegogo has not yet hosted another ICO. This is not because the company is having second thoughts after the recent market downturn or the platform has failed to attract startups.\nIn fact, White said that Indiegogo has seen a \u201cdeluge of interest\u201d from not only startups but also Fortune 500 companies, a group that includes the world\u2019s largest publicly-listed and private corporations. Indiegogo says that it will thoroughly vet projects before it lists them on its platform, which has likely contributed to the delay.\nYesterday, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton said that every ICO he has encountered should be classified as a security under federal regulations, a statement that will likely drive even more startups to platforms such as Indiegogo and tZERO, both of which aim to facilitate security token sales that comply with these regulations.", "category": "ICO News"}

This is the single biggest bitcoin donation in US political history. It also opens the debate about cryptocurrencies, political donations and transparency.\nPetersen\u2019s campaign aide stated:\n\u201cI think it goes without saying we\u2019re going to see a lot more of this in terms of campaign contributions and campaign financing. Austin is personally a fan of competition in the marketplace, even when it comes to our currency. With the rise of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, it was a no-brainer for us to use those.\u201d\nBitcoin \u2013 A New Political Currency?\nThis new milestone now cements Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency assets, as a new means of increasing campaign contributions through alternative digital currency donations. The Missouri-based Republican Senate candidate received 24 bitcoin donations, totalling $9,700.\nHowever, this isn\u2019t the first-time cryptocurrencies have made an appearance within the realm of campaign contributions. Rand Paul, during his somewhat pensive 2016 Presidential Campaign, accepted Bitcoin. Other congressional and Senate campaigns have also accepted Bitcoin, with Jared Polis in 2014 being the first congressional campaign to accept Bitcoin.\nThe Federal Election Commission has given guidance to voters, donors and campaign chiefs about the use of cryptocurrency assets \u2013 in a further move to help bolster their use within the campaign contribution arena of US politics.\nCryptocurrency: The Future of Political Campaign Contributions?\nThe reason this recent development is \u2018newsworthy\u2019 surrounds the matter of fact way it was reported. It is a purposeful sign that maturity has encroached upon the Bitcoin landscape, in that senior lawmakers now seem happy, across the political divide, to accept these non-government backed digital currencies to help improve campaign contribution and donor engagement.\nAs more and more people become crypto wealthy, as the investment class matures, there is a growing population of new crypto millionaires. This new cluster of wealth could become a well of possible future political donations for all political parties.\nSome also argue that this could help further promote cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies with lawmakers. As more politicians start to accept Bitcoin, the more the political class will start to become more pliable in regard to the crypto lobby\u2019s overall demands in terms of public policy development and enactment.\nHowever, this \u2018largest ever\u2019 Bitcoin donation represented less than 3 percent of Austin Petersen\u2019s overall campaign donation total. The dollar, therefore, still reigns supreme in the context of party political contributions but Bitcoin could one day surpass the greenback in the pursuit of political influence.", "category": "Accepts Bitcoin"}

Some exchanges have entirely stopped new user sign-ups. One of the biggest exchanges of them all, Coinbase, has also faced many issues and admitted poor customer experience for verification in a blog post.\nHere\u2019s a chart compiled by a twitter user showing Coinbase\u2019s growth over the past few years.\n\nThe chart has not been updated since November 2017 because the company no longer provides the info. But one look at the chart should give you an idea of the demand for Cryptocurrencies in the last quarter of 2017. At its peak, Coinbase was adding 100,000 users a day.\nLast year, Coinbase reportedly hit $1 Billion in revenue\u00a0and the company\u2019s valuation has doubled from $1.6 Billion in August. The company is being constantly pinged by investors to sell their shares and the demand is high since the company does not allow stakeholders to sell their holding on secondary markets.\nBut not everything has been going in Coinbase\u2019s way in the last few months. Just yesterday, the company admitted to handling the Credit Card fees applied by banks poorly. Some banks have been billing Coinbase customers with \u2018Advance Cash\u2019 which comes with additional charges. The company has now included a disclaimer asking customers to switch to a Debit Card or Bank Account to avoid these fees.\nLast week, the company announced the hiring of Hiriji from TD Ameritrade to improve Customer Service which has also been lacking heavily for the past few months.\nMost exchanges have a customer verification process, and so does Coinbase. The company could not verify identities as fast as users were signing up, which resulted in a lot of unhappy first-time users.\nTo fix this, Coinbase has replaced the identity verification system in place with a newer one which makes use of Machine Learning. Coinbase claims that the new system in place can successfully verify nearly 90% of all Customer IDs.\nCoinBase also said that they\u2019ve signed up with a new ID verification vendor to help balance the load during peak periods. However, this new vendor was not named in the blog post.\nAlso, Coinbase claims for the remaining 10% of the IDs that fail to register, most of the times it is an issue with the ID uploaded. The ID Verification system will not be able to verify if the verification uploaded is Cropped, low-res or blurry.\nPreviously in such instances, customers had to contact the customer-support and have their problem fixed which takes time. With the new system in place, when an ID verification fails, Coinbase will send out an automated mail to the customer on why the verification failed and specific solutions to fix it.\nThe new verification is already live on the website, and mobile apps will be updated in the coming weeks. One look at Coinbase\u2019s\u00a0Reddit Page has so many complaints about people having a bad experience with the verification system. Hopefully, the new verification system in place fixes those concerns.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

We plan to resume normal operations for JPY withdrawals from the following date (February 13th) and will process customer requests in the order in which they come in.\u201d\nFurthermore, the company said the date of withdrawals is unrelated to its promise to issue reparation payments for XEM holders who lost their tokens in an infamous hack in late January. Two weeks ago to the day, Coincheck executives\u00a0dramatically confirmed swirling rumors that the exchange had been the victim of a hack wherein 500 million NEM tokens, worth \u00a0$530 million at the time, had been stolen from its hot wallet. The following day, Coincheck announced its intention to compensate some 260,000 NEM holding victims.\nThe incident saw Japan\u2019s finance minister, a notable critic of excessive regulation of the cryptocurrency sector, urge Japanese regulators to wield better supervision over cryptocurrency exchanges. Coincheck is among 16 exchanges current operating without an official grant and registration under Japan\u2019s financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA). This week, the regulator has reportedly set to path on-site inspections of various cryptocurrency exchanges as a concentrated move to increase scrutiny and force domestic exchanges to adopt better cybersecurity practices.", "category": "Exchanges"}

To prove solvency, the company posted its wallet addresses so users could verify that funds had not been moved.\nAs of the time of writing, users reported being unable to access Binance through its primary domain address, which Zhao said was the result of a now-resolved DDoS attack on the company\u2019s cloud provider that was still causing lingering issues.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, and Litecoin all demonstrated a slight change in their values, failing to show large price movements.\nBitcoin Cash Surges\nWhile the majority cryptocurrencies in the market recorded a 1 to 3 percent decline or increase in price, the value of Bitcoin Cash skyrocketed by 25 percent, leading traders in the cryptocurrency community to suspect a short-term pump.\nOver the past few weeks, throughout the large correction, cryptocurrencies in the global market moved on a similar trend led by bitcoin and Ethereum. Apart from several rare instances wherein small market cap cryptocurrencies like FunFair increased for a brief period of time, the majority of cryptocurrencies in the market moved up and down simultaneously.\nHowever, in the past 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin Cash increased from $995 to $1,250, with volume heavily concentrated on OKEx, the Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchanges operated by OKCoin, formerly the largest cryptocurrency exchange in China prior to the country\u2019s cryptocurrency trading ban in September 2017.\n\nBitcoin Cash remains as the most frequently traded cryptocurrency on the OKEx trading platform, which currently is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world with a daily trading volume of $2.4 billion. Previously, OKEx fell behind South Korea\u2019s UpBit and Binance in terms of daily trading volume. But, because Binance has been offline for well over 24 hours due to a server issue, OKEx overtook Binance temporarily to become the biggest exchange in the global cryptocurrency market.\nOne similarity between all of the cryptocurrencies that have recorded massive gains over the past 24 hours including Bitcoin Cash, Qtum, and Ethereum Classic is that they are all heavily concentrated in the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market. This week, premiums in the South Korean market have started to reappear, which is significant given that for the past few days, cryptocurrencies were actually cheaper on South Korean exchanges.\nSince Bitcoin Cash, Qtum, and Ethereum Classic are all supported by the country\u2019s most widely utilized exchanges in Bithumb, UpBit, and Korbit, it is likely that the recovery of the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market and the entrance of new investors into the local market led the three cryptocurrencies to surge up in value. \nSeveral traders suspected Roger Ver, the CEO at Bitcoin.com and an early-stage bitcoin angel investor, of bringing up the price of Bitcoin Cash prior to his interview with Alex Jones on February 9. However, Ver denied such rumors, firmly emphasizing that he has not made any bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash trades as of recent. \nWith a $2.5 billion daily trading volume, Bitcoin Cash is the third most liquid cryptocurrency in the global market, behind bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin Cash rarely achieved a two billion dollar daily trading volume over the past few months and thus, the recent pump in the volume and price of Bitcoin Cash remains questionable.\nShort-Term Trend\nOverall, although the market has rebounded from its large correction last week, it is still struggling to show signs of mid-term recovery. Hedge fund investor and Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead, stated that bitcoin along with other cryptocurrencies will likely surge up in value again in several weeks.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re 52 days into this. It seems like another couple of weeks and everything will be normal and [bitcoin] can start growing back up again,\u201d said Morehead.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

Initially, the agency had sought records from all of the company\u2019s customers, but the firm successfully argued that this request was overly-broad.\n\u201cThat more than 14,000 Coinbase users have either bought, sold, sent or received at least $20,000 worth of Bitcoin in a given year suggests that many Coinbase users may not be reporting their Bitcoin gains,\u201d U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley wrote in the ruling. \u201cThe IRS has a legitimate interest in investigating these taxpayers.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear how zealous the IRS will be in its quest to bring Bitcoin tax evaders to justice. Under current US law, cryptocurrency owners are required to pay taxes on profits realized from any cryptocurrency transaction \u2014 even the proverbial coffee purchase. The Congressional Blockhcian Caucus has introduced legislation that would eliminate reporting requirements for transactions worth less than $600, but it has not yet been passed into law.\nHowever, Fort told Bloomberg that IRS investigators are currently focusing their attention on cryptocurrency brokerage platforms and cryptocurrency exchanges, where investors convert their holdings back into cash.\nIn any case, though, the message is clear: if you have realized profits from cryptocurrency investments, Uncle Sam knows about it \u2014 and he wants his cut.", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

This time, however, it was the Ripple price\u2019s turn to lead the rally, and the third-largest cryptocurrency posted a large-cap-best 21 percent increase.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nAt present, the cryptocurrency market cap is valued at $413 billion, representing a 24-hour increase of about four percent.\nBitcoin Price Trades Sideways as Other Top Coins Advance\nThe Bitcoin price ended the day on a sideways trajectory after recovering from sub-$8,000 dip that lasted for several hours. Bitcoin is now trading at $8,351 on Bitfinex, which translates into a $142 billion market cap.\nBitcoin Price Chart\nThis temporary dip may have been partially-tied to concern that Binance \u2014 the world\u2019s highest-volume cryptocurrency exchange \u2014 had been hacked, as inaccurate rumors began to fly after the exchange went down on Wednesday evening and continued to remain offline on Thursday.\nOn Friday morning, though, Binance completed its system maintenance, which involved re-syncing its entire replica database, and trading resumed at approximately 10 am UTC.\nEthereum Price Achieves Minor Increase\nThe Ethereum price fared slightly better than Bitcoin on Friday, as the second-largest cryptocurrency rose three percent to $840. Ethereum\u2019s market cap is now valued at $82.3 billion.\nEthereum Price Chart\nRipple Price Headlines Large-Cap Index\nThe day\u2019s best performance, however, came from third-ranked Ripple, whose price exploded by 21 percent to outpace other top-tier cryptocurrencies by a considerable margin. At present, the Ripple price is trading at $0.91 against USD trading pairs, although it has ticked up closer to the $1 mark on South Korean exchanges, which process significantly more XRP volume.\nRipple Price Chart\nThe primary factor behind Ripple\u2019s rise appears to be an uptick in trading in those South Korean markets, as it appears that more domestic traders are performing the necessary KYC compliance to resume trading following the implementation of a ban on anonymous trading in the country.\nAltcoins Post Minor Advances\nThe remainder of the altcoin markets were generally-characterized by positive movement, although some cryptocurrencies did decline against the dollar.\n\nBitcoin Cash extended its rally by another seven percent, raising its price to $1,312 and market cap to $22.3 billion. Cardano, NEO, and Stellar, meanwhile, each saw their prices rise by about one percent.\nEOS and Litecoin performed slightly better, rising three percent and two percent, respectively, bringing their prices to current values of $8.60 and $149.\nNotably, IOTA managed to rise back into the top 10 following an extended absence. It achieved this mark despite declining one percent for the day because NEM \u2014 the former occupant of the 10th spot on the market cap charts \u2014 endured a four percent pullback that dropped its market cap below $5 billion.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

In a few years, he said the issue won\u2019t even be a question.\nSupport Isn\u2019t Unanimous\nNot all lawmakers support the measure. Arizona State Senate Minority Leader Steve Farley said if the proposal passes, it could put all taxpayers at risk if bitcoin crashes.

Since 2012, Google has led 140 equity investments totaling roughly $1.2 billion in the blockchain sector. The question lingers, why hasn\u2019t Google directly built or added blockchain into its search functionality? \nCurrently, Google has monopolized the search market and now controls nearly 80 percent of desktop and 95 percent of mobile searches. In fact, Google handles over 40,000 search queries every second, which translates to over 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year. The service effectively serves as the \u201cgatekeeper to the digital world,\u201d an extremely influential role that dramatically shapes the direction of our internet-based economy. \nMany believe, however, that a role of this significance should not be entrusted to one company. Having a single entity in charge is particularly troublesome because it can operate in an opaque manner. \n\u201cThe original purpose of the web and internet, if you recall, was to build a common neutral network which everyone can participate in equally for the betterment of humanity,\u201d writes Matthew Hodgson in TechCrunch. \u201cBut now we have Skype from Microsoft, Facetime from Apple, and Google with Duo. Each big company has its own equivalent service, each stuck in its own bubble. These services may be great, but they aren\u2019t exactly what we imagined during the dream years when the internet was being built.\u201d \nThe conglomerates mentioned by Hodgson have taken over the digital world. They control access to our most important information and confidential data. However, Hodgson goes on to say that \u201cthere is an emerging movement to bring the web back to this vision and it even involves some of the key figures from the birth of the web. It\u2019s called the Decentralized Web or Web 3.0, and it describes an emerging trend to build services on the internet which do not depend on any single \u2018central\u2019 organization to function.\u201d \nThere are a number of inherent security and efficiency advantages to using a distributed, blockchain-based system to store information that centralized data warehouses cannot compete with. \nNo longer a piece of science fiction or part of a silly television show, a decentralized internet is inevitably becoming a reality.\u00a0Emerging blockchain startups are beginning to realize the full potential of a distributed economy, as they build out different components of this new decentralized ecosystem. \nPresearch, is developing an open, decentralized search engine that \u201crewards community members with Presearch Tokens for their usage, contribution to, and promotion of the platform.\u201d \nUnlike Google, Presearch\u2019s decentralized search model will utilize \u201copen and transparent ranking factors, which will enable content creators to access a level playing field, and [give] users the choice of which data to utilize.\u201d The service will empower the community (the users) with the ability to partake in voting and funding of development opportunities. A project of this scale promises to dramatically disrupt the market for search. \nStartups leveraging the power of the blockchain to build decentralized systems are poised to disrupt other areas as well. \nIPFS, short for interplanetary file system, has attracted a significant amount of attention from the fintech community. A recent Wired article says that the idea behind IPFS is to have web browsers store copies of the pages they visit and then do double duty as web servers. That way, if the original server disappears, the people who visited the page can still share it with the world. \nWired writes that, in this model, \u201cpublishers get improved resilience, and readers get to support the content they care about. Eventually, the IPFS team and a gaggle of other groups hope to make it possible to build interactive apps along the lines of Facebook that don\u2019t require any centralized servers to run.\u201d\nAs more consumers and enterprises buy into the decentralized economy, it will be interesting to see which projects gain widespread adoption the fastest. The Google\u2019s of the world are investing significant capital in bringing frontier technologies, like blockchain, to the masses sooner rather than later. Let the race begin.", "category": "News"}

Bitcoin closed below $7,000 on Feb. 5, but it\u2019s been mostly recovering ground since then, with the top cryptocurrency perched above $8,600 on Feb. 9. Meanwhile, institutional investor exposure to bitcoin hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface.\n\nInstitutional Interest\nMorehead\u2019s bullish position on bitcoin seems to be predicated, at least somewhat, on his knowledge of his institutional peers, where he says \u201cthere\u2019s such an appetite to get exposure to this,\u201d adding that it\u2019s a $500 billion asset class that \u201cnobody owns.\u201d With most hedge funds, pensions, private equity, etc. on the sidelines, the bitcoin price continues to march to its own drummer.\nBut a sign that the hedge fund industry\u2019s interest is piqued is reflected in the data.

Now, it has been confirmed that the country will also simultaneously lay down provisions to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges in the near future.\nIn an interview with CNBC TV18,\u00a0 Indian Economic Affairs secretary S.C. Garg revealed a panel has been set up by the government to prepare a report on cryptocurrencies, which is expected to be published by the end of the fiscal year. \nHe emphasized:\n\u201cThe government will take steps to make it illegal as a payment system.\u201d\nFurther, the official went on to hint at upcoming regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges and the trading of \u2018crypto-assets\u2019.\n\u201cWe hope now within this financial year the committee will finalize its recommendations \u2026 certainly, there will be a regulator,\u201d Garg, who is heading the panel, said.\u00a0In presenting the country\u2019s budget, India\u2019s Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told the parliament that the government will be enforcing a zero-tolerance policy on the use of cryptocurrencies for transactions of illegal nature.\nInterestingly, the remarks made by Jaitley sparked widespread mania within the Indian bitcoin community that misinterpreted his words to believe that the government was banning cryptocurrencies. Soon after his statement was broadcast on live television, the price of bitcoin crashed, before recovering soon after.\nClaims of cryptocurrencies being possibly used for terrorism and contraband purchases dates back several years now and are almost as old as the market itself. So far, however, there has been no major evidence linking the two, apart from the Silk Road scandal that revealed bitcoin to be the primary vehicle for drug and armament related transactions. Despite that fact, it is important to note that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, have found several legitimate uses.\nIt is clear now that India does not wish to embrace cryptocurrencies as a payment alternative and instead, regulate them as a new asset class. Such behavior has been demonstrated by several governments in the past, including the United States. After all, permitting payments in cryptocurrency allows people to bypass state-backed fiat currencies entirely.\nWhile substituting cash for bitcoin was the original vision for the digital currency, as stated in its whitepaper, it seems as if states around the world are only willing to accept it as a digital store of value, akin to gold. Precious metals are not recognized as legal tender either.\nZebpay, one of India\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, has released a blog post on the matter, stating that the outcome has been rather positive and that it will comply with any relevant regulation introduced by the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee.", "category": "News"}

At press time, the cryptocurrency market made a bullish pivot, as US regulators signaled they\u2019ll take a cautious approach to cryptocurrency regulations during a high-profile Senate hearing.\nAt press time, according to data CCN\u2019s price index, bitcoin is trading at $8,387 after rising 24.5 percent in the last 24-hour period. This may be only the beginning of the flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s rise this year, as according to CNBC experts see bitcoin go on a bull run greater than last year and hit $50,000.\nIn fact, experts believe the cryptocurrency ecosystem may surpass the $1 trillion mark, as other cryptocurrencies may also see significant gains.Thomas Glucksmann, head of APAC business development at cryptocurrency exchange Gatecoin, noted that regulatory recognition, technological development, and the entrance of institutional capital will contribute to this year\u2019s push.\nHe stated:\n\u201cIncreasing regulatory recognition of cryptocurrency exchanges, the entrance of institutional capital and major technology developments will contribute to the market\u2019s rebound and push cryptocurrency prices to all new highs this year,\u201d\nTo Glucksmann, there\u2019s no reason not to see bitcoin push to $50,000 by December. The technology he referenced was bitcoin\u2019s much-anticipated Lightning Network (LN), which recently surpassed a major milestone as by reaching 1,000 mainnet payment channels.\nAnother possible catalyst for the recovery could be the release of a cryptocurrency backed instrument listed on a major exchange. While both CME and CBOE already launched bitcoin futures, Nasdaq recently revealed it is \u201ccontinuing to investigate\u201d these products.\nAs CNBC points out, there is still no bitcoin ETF on the market. An ETF, exchange-traded fund, would allow people to trade bitcoin without having to buy the cryptocurrency. Recently, bitcoin ETF applications were forced to withdraw at the request of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nJamie Burke, CEO at venture capital firm Outlier Ventures, noted that the astounding price rises the cryptocurrency market saw last year could be topped this year. He stated:\n\u201cWe believe after February the market will likely go on a bull run comparative if not greater than last year potentially reaching the trillion-dollar mark before a proper crypto winter sets in where the market becomes more focused on proper market fundamentals.\u201d\nOther Tokens Could See Exponential Price Rises This Year\nAlthough some experts see bitcoin hit $50,000, some believe the cryptocurrency has no fundamental value. Others see potential in cryptocurrencies that can be used to build new blockchain applications, such as NEO and Ethereum.\nMick Sherman, CEO and co-founder of data science company Hercules Tech, said cryptocurrency like IOTA, NEO, and Ethereum are the ones to keep an eye on, as they are creating platforms developers can build on.\nHe said:\n\u201cUtility tokens and assets with a working platform and a clear-cut reason for requiring both a blockchain and their own token, are more likely to appreciate in value this year. Some of these cryptoassets will not be used for years, meaning they have no utility value,\u201d\nSherman further warned that blockchain technology is incredibly hyped, and as such we may see \u201cseveral more bubbles.\u201d This, before we see \u201cviable blockchain-based assets.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

Did you pay with Bitcoin? If the answers to both questions are positive, you might have a cause for concern. It\u2019s not only because the amount you spent for some naughty trifle back then can be worth a high-end vehicle today. It\u2019s also because the evidence of that transaction may still be possible to retrieve, although the Silk Road was shut down in 2013.\nResearchers at Qatar University and the Qatar Computing Research Institute at Hamad Bin Khalifa University released a report on January 23, 2018, where they demonstrated how Bitcoin transaction analysis can be leveraged to de-anonymize Tor users. In more than 100 cases, they were able to link somebody\u2019s shady blockchain transactions to those people\u2019s publicly available accounts. Moreover, the analysts managed to associate more than 20 of those public accounts with payments on Tor hidden services, including the Silk Road and The Pirate Bay.\nHere is a statement from the report that speaks volumes about the scope of the problem:\n\u201cDue to its pseudonymity model, Bitcoin lacks retroactive operational security, which means historical pieces of information could be used to identify a certain user.\u201d\nThere is a certain degree of duality in the nature of Bitcoin privacy-wise. On the one hand, this cryptocurrency is not directly monitored by any financial institution or government, therefore it should be extremely problematic to establish ties between a Bitcoin transaction and the user\u2019s real-life identity. On the other hand, the ledger of all Bitcoin transactions called the blockchain keeps track of all transfers from one address to another.\nOnce you find out an individual\u2019s Bitcoin address, it shouldn\u2019t be too painstaking to figure out who they are submitting funds to or receiving them from. What can tangle this type of OSINT (open-source intelligence) is the user\u2019s effort to split those transactions by leveraging intermediary addresses, or the use of laundering services that obfuscate details on the actual sender and recipient of the payment.\nUnfortunately, there is very little academic research being done on the subject of exploiting these hallmarks of the Bitcoin architecture to identify payment transactions on the dark web. To their credit, the researchers from Qatar have made a real breakthrough in this direction by harvesting data that literally lays on the surface. First, they collected tens of Bitcoin addresses that Tor hidden services use or used for donations and other day-to-day deals. These services include WikiLeaks, Snowden Defense Fund, The Pirate Bay, ProtonMail, the Silk Road, and Agora, to name a few. Next, they obtained a list of thousands of Bitcoin addresses by traversing people\u2019s public accounts, such as Twitter and Bitcoin Talk forum.\nBy simply juxtaposing these two sets of addresses, the analysts were able to spot 125 transactions made to the accounts of the services under scrutiny. Obviously, it doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to link these payments to users\u2019 public accounts. These transactions included 46 donations to WikiLeaks, 10 fund transfers to The Pirate Bay, and 22 payments to the Silk Road criminal marketplace. \nSpeaking of the latter, some of these 22 individuals completely neglected OPSEC (operations security) as they were careless enough to publicly disclose their full names, email addresses, locations, ages, and genders. One of them was found to be a teenager when dealing with the dark web service in question. There is a particularly strong reason for 18 of these people to start worrying as their transactions were tied to Bitcoin Talk. The thing is, this forum is being bombarded by subpoenas requesting users\u2019 registration details and other confidential information.\nThe Qatari researchers emphasize that they conducted their analysis using simple techniques that are available to the general public. They found Bitcoin addresses anyone else can spot and performed a regular matching routine. Furthermore, no instruments available to official authorities were at their disposal, as opposed to the case where the IRS (U.S. Internal Revenue Service) demanded that the Coinbase wallet provider disclose some customers\u2019 Bitcoin addresses. Obviously, more motivated sleuths with plenty of resources and time on their hands can unveil the details of users who take their OPSEC much more seriously.\nLaw enforcement agencies have demonstrated that they are willing to investigate past misdemeanors by scrutinizing the blockchain. For instance, a former FBI agent stated in the courtroom that he had traced a transfer of $13.4 million worth of Bitcoin from the Silk Road marketplace to the computer of its founder Ross Ulbricht. Another case involved a German national who was fined 3,000 Euros by local law enforcement for ordering cannabis from the Silk Road years back.\nAll of these caveats as to the privacy aspects of using Bitcoin have made its aficionados more vigilant when transacting. The same applies to dark markets, including those for contraband and ransomware, which are shifting away from Bitcoin due to increased regulation attempts by governments and the apparent privacy shortcomings mentioned above. Malicious economies are increasingly switching to the use of altcoins boasting better privacy by design, such as Monero and Zcash.\nHowever, based on the findings of the Qatari researchers, even a more scrupulous privacy hygiene may leave a trail of breadcrumbs leading to a specific individual, no matter how much time has passed since the Bitcoin transaction took place. The blockchain stores it all and cannot be edited. Erasing Bitcoin address details from public profiles may not do the trick either \u2013 the entry may have been cached and can thus be retrieved afterward.\nThe author, David Balaban, is a computer security researcher with over 15 years\u00a0of\u00a0experience in malware analysis and antivirus software evaluation.\u00a0", "category": "Bitcoin Security"}

It\u2019s a costly and lengthy process, and with the user base growing traditional blockchains are struggling.\nThis is because every single transaction needs to be \u2018mined\u2019 by powerful computers solving complex mathematical problems. It\u2019s a process that ensures the security of the network, preventing double spends and other malicious actions. Whilst effective, the energy inefficiency of this process is truly staggering. And that\u2019s not all. With each transaction needing a lengthy confirmation process, the blockchain cannot scale easily as more and more users join the network. Bitcoin transactions are now unbearably slow and expensive, with long backlogs of transactions waiting their turn.\nEthereum too is suffering from the same issue. Although the network can currently handle around fifteen transactions per second, significantly more than Bitcoin, we need only look at the recent Cryptokitties mania to see the crippling effect of high network load. Backlogs of transactions quickly built up and transaction prices skyrocketed as users fought to get included in the next block.\u00a0With the severe limitations proof of work seen, it seems impossible for real-world use cases to succeed. VISA and other non-blockchains handle thousands of transactions per second, and if the many projects emerging in the crypto space are to compete, something needs to change.\nEnter Proof of Stake.\nVitalik Buterin, mastermind of the Ethereum system, aims to introduce what is known as a Proof of Stake this year. The upgrade to the network is known as Casper, and it promises to be a game changer. Instead of powerful miners verifying transactions on the network, users will be able to \u2018stake\u2019 their Ether. If the stakers act honestly, confirming legitimate transactions, they will be rewarded with interest proportional to their stake. If the stakers act maliciously and try to cheat the system, their stake will be lost.\u00a0The chief developer behind Casper is Vlad Zamfir, who has been working on the upgrade since 2014. It has been live on the Ethereum testnet since January and currently requires 1500 eth to participate. It\u2019s likely that this number will be lowered when the mainnet release happens, and if you\u2019re worried you still might not be able to participate, don\u2019t be! Staking pools will work similarly to current mining pools, where users pool their resources and share the rewards.\nEconomics\nCasper could bring huge changes to the Ethereum economic model, and consequently the price of Ether. Not only will transactions be confirmed much faster, enabling the growth of the network whilst saving polar bears,it will also cap the total number of Ethereum available. Currently, new Ether is generated through a mining process similar to Bitcoin\u2019s. With Casper, stakers will be rewarded from the transaction fees generated. A fixed amount of Ether will mean no inflation. Combined with the increased demand Casper will generate (to stake, a fixed amount of Ether is required), we can surely expect an increase in price as users buy up and lock away Eth in stake.\nWith this change, will we see the fabled flippening, with Ethereum dethroning Bitcoin to become the most valuable cryptocurrency?\u00a0It remains to be seen.\nRaising the stakes\nThis prophecy might be narrow-focused, as it\u2019s not only Ethereum that is drawing eyes through plans to introduce Proof of Stake. In the last week, Cardano updated it\u2019s roadmap, setting out its plans to switch to a proof of stake model as early as Q2 of this year. Created by early Ethereum developer Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is hoping to tackle the blockchain\u2019s many issues through a focus on academic research and rigor.\nMeanwhile, other projects are escaping the limitations of proof of work in entirely different ways. IOTA, frontlined by David S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8s moving away from Blockchain entirely. Instead, the protocol offers a system where transactions are arranged in a tangle, a so-called Directed Acyclic Graph, with each transaction working to verify other transactions.\nNew technology is asking serious questions of what are seen as outdated Proof of Work systems, offering various solutions to the problems of and efficiency. Proof of Stake is one likely candidate in the running, and this year could be its make or break moment.\nWhilst the limitations of Proof of Work are well documented, many continue to put their faith in protocols such as the Bitcoin network. It needs to be stated that developments within these systems are ongoing as well, with Lightning Network and block size change in the contention. However, whether these upgrades can truly tackle the limitations proof of work systems face remains to be seen, and other projects aren\u2019t hanging around.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

Our approach around this topic is \u2026 we want to be forward thinking and we want to be open to new ideas.\u201d\nThe discussion spilled over into the delivery of bitcoin futures contracts, margins, volatility and the regulatory response to any unusual aberrations on margin \u2014\u00a0 all evidence that the CFTC is engaged with the cryptocurrency market and the market forces surrounding it.\nSelf-Regulate\nBut in order for bitcoin and the blockchain to mature, especially in light of the limited resources and mixed feelings about it in Congress, some form of self regulation is needed. It\u2019s a course that was similarly taken in the traditional markets with groups like FINRA. Such groups can help bring lawmakers up to speed and can also lobby on behalf of the budding cryptocurrency industry on Capitol Hill.\n\u201cBetween now and when Congress chooses how to act \u2026 between exchanges and spot market regulation, I\u2019d like to use this opportunity to call on the investment community and advocacy community around digital currencies to create some type of self-regulatory [organization], to develop standards around cyber policy, insider trading, ethics, codes of conduct,\u201d he said, adding that self regulation has a strong history in our markets.\nThe Future\nQuintenz sponsors a CFTC tech committee, which meets for the first time next week. The topics include distributed ledger technology and bitcoin, digital currency, and more. These are issues the agency is interested in receiving feedback on.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

The signs for that are not bad.\nFor all the euphoria that cryptocurrencies have triggered in recent months, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Co. have not yet arrived in the so-called real economy. Aside from some (sometimes shady) online retailers and some less permanent shops, cryptocurrencies are not accepted as a means of payment.\nThis is completely understandable if you look at the problems that cryptocurrencies would make today for a giant in the industry like Amazon. There is enormous volatility. Fluctuations of 20 \u2013 30 percent have not been rare recently. The adoption would, therefore, involve a considerable risk for the retailer. Well, in the era of exchange-traded Bitcoin futures, hedging via the futures market would be possible. But it would be connected with transaction costs, which would increase the already high fees for Bitcoin.\nBut another point is actually much more important: the transaction speed. The Bitcoin Blockchain currently allows just seven transactions per second. For Ethereum, this value is about twice as high. Amazon reported 600 transactions per second last year at its peak. Even if only a small proportion of Amazon customers would pay with Bitcoin or Ethereum (and no other Bitcoin transactions would take place worldwide), the current state of the art would quickly lead to unreasonable waiting times.\nBut the masterminds of cryptocurrencies tell us that these are just teething troubles that will be resolved in the foreseeable future. Either through improvements in the Blockchain of existing currencies or through new, better performing coins. Ripple, for example, can today withstand already 1500 transactions per second and could meet the demands of Amazon. For experts, it is not a question of if but simply when the big retailers will accept payment in cryptocurrencies. That would be the final breakthrough. If, for example, Amazon accepted Bitcoin as a payment method, that would give a lot of credit to the digital currency.\nWe are not so far along but there is clear evidence that the big players are working on the issue. Amazon has, for example, secured some domains connected to cryptocurrency. Starbucks is said to want to accept cryptocurrencies soon.\nTherefore, it is worth it to take a look at how paying with Bitcoin and Co. could look. A likely way is crypto-credit cards. In fact, these credit cards are available today already. Three providers of such cards stand out to us: The first is Monaco, a Swiss company that recently collected 25 million USD with its ICO.\nAnother one is TenX, from Singapore, who took in 80 million USD in total with their ICO. And, finally, savedroid, from Frankfurt, which is currently in the middle of their ICO and which has announced the launch of a crypto-credit card.\nThe crypto-credit cards can already be used today for online shopping \u2013 at least in theory. However, for each transaction, their users have to first convert the amount on the bill to a fiat currency, before they can pay. This makes the payment expensive and cumbersome \u2013 which means that there are few people shopping today with crypto-credit cards. But this problem will go away as soon as the big retailers accept payment in crypto. Then the starting signal will have been fired \u2013 for this new way of paying and for the acceptance of cryptos in the general population.\nThe author of the article is\u00a0Tobias Zander, founder\u00a0and CTO of Savedroid.", "category": "Guest Contributor"}

HODL nuts will hold their melting Bitcoins all the way down to ZERO while scammers and whales dump and run\u2026\n\u2014 Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) February 6, 2018\n\nHe further praised Augustin Carstens, the chief of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), who recently labeled Bitcoin a \u201ccombination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme, and an environmental disaster.\u201d\nOf course, as CCN reported, the US Senate hearing on cryptocurrencies did not go quite as Dr Doom expected.\nIn fact, demonstrated that while industry regulation is likely to increase in the coming months and years, neither regulators or legislators are dismissing cryptocurrency as a fad. Rather, regulators stressed that Congress should pursue regulations cautiously and that they should be \u201ccarefully tailored\u201d to address specific risks and protect investors from scams.\nThe cryptocurrency markets made a bullish pivot as the hearing progressed, and by Tuesday the Bitcoin price had recovered to a global average of $8,435 \u2014 a single-day gain of 22 percent.\nBut fret not, Bitcoin bears, Roubini has an explanation for this too.

The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) began ramping up its scrutiny against domestic exchanges in early 2017.\nAs reported by state-funded website ThePaper.cn, an excerpt from the article by PBoC-affiliated article read:\n\u201cTo prevent and mitigate financial risks, authorities will take regulatory measures against ICOs and virtual currency exchanges inside and outside the country, including the banning of relevant businesses, banning and disposing of domestic and foreign exchange virtual currency websites.\u201d\nChina first issued the \u2018Notice\u2019 of a sweeping ban on initial coin offerings on \u00a0September 4, quickly followed by restrictions to effectively shutter domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, mandating them to completely stop trading activities by September 30.\n\u201cAfter the clean-up and remediation, the trading volume of virtual currencies denominated in renminbi (RMB) dropped from over 90% of global trading volume to less than 1% at one time, greatly reducing the risk levels,\u201d the report said.\nBeijing\u2019s ongoing move to ban and censor access to domestic cryptocurrency businesses and international exchange platforms respectively comes within a week of China\u2019s internet finance association learning that previous measures to eradicate investments into cryptocurrencies have failed. The authority subsequently issued a public notice warning investors to be wary of risks in overseas cryptocurrency trading and participation in initial coin offerings (ICOs).\nAccording to yesterday\u2019s report, China\u2019s central bank has gone a step further in effectively constructing a firewall to keep domestic traders and investors from using websites of international cryptocurrency exchanges. Implementing the regulatory blockade is done with the \u2018spirit of the Notice\u2019, the publication added, confirming its findings that domestic investors had turned to overseas platforms after the local ban.\nPointing to Japan and Hong Kong as destinations for Chinese cryptocurrency traders, the report said:\n\u201cOverseas transactions, regulatory evasion, virtual currency trading and ICO activities have resurgence trend.\u00a0Take some overseas ICOs with domestic participation as an example.

In Uber\u2019s case, the consensus is agreeing on a price to travel a certain distance. Airbnb\u2019s case is agreeing on a fee and conditions for a person to stay at another person\u2019s house. Simple, right?\nThe most disruptive technologies around the internet, besides communication platforms, are the most essential that you do not see. Like the ability to send information without the need of a third party. You don\u2019t need the post office to send a letter for you. What I mean is that the best part of the internet is the protocol. The possibility of converting most types of data into bytes, encoding that string and sending it across the network to another peer that will receive the package, decipher the message at his end and be able to unlock its content.\nDoes it sound familiar?\nThe Internet of Money\nCryptocurrencies are peer-to-peer digital money. You have a sending address who sends X coins to another address. Those coins are sent in a hash that is cyphered by a hashing algorithm. Nodes then compete to solve the hash and decipher the message. The node that solves the final piece of the puzzle gets the reward, all to itself, pirate style.\nIf cryptocurrencies are just nothing more than messages stored in a database, which is a ledger by the way, then they are protocols. Not all of them, sure, but the ones that are a currency (and not an asset). For example, if bitcoin is a protocol, then it\u2019s simply a message, much like the internet protocol IPv6. A package of data sent across the network (blockchain) which nodes simply validate hence creating transactions and generating blocks. They secure the ledger which is immutable.\nThe whole point of this concept is the elimination intermediaries. People stop needing a third party institution to validate transactions and to store value, as all those features are part of the blockchain. The true power of distributed ledgers is the ability to achieve consensus between two parties where the third party is represented by nodes who secure the ledger. And anyone can setup a node and run the blockchain.\nMost cryptocurrencies solve problems no internet company has ever dreamed of. And don\u2019t forget, any new technology suffers from hypes.\nhttps://www.aniwaa.com/blog/why-we-invested-2000-in-3d-printing-stocks/\nThere are other exciting things being developed in many different tech fields. But all of them, with no exception, depend on one thing: money. That is why happenings like the end of internet neutrality are a thing, you see, because money always speaks louder than reason. If you do not fight back against organizations being able to manipulate internet traffic, you\u2019re doomed to a failed network.\nConclusion\nBeing the internet of money and due to the fact bitcoin won\u2019t lose all its value as long as there is at least one node running.\nCryptocurrency will most likely be the technology with the most impact during the next few decades (I hope!). If you really think about how deep this change of mentality can go, consider this:\nWhy would you ever use a network that does not reward you for sharing your data?\nCompanies do not own it. You do.", "category": "News"}

Two scammers, posing as Seele admins @nicsmith and @SeeleSupport reportedly directly messaged some of the channel\u2019s members and asked them to send over Ether as part of a private sale. The @nicsmith account supposedly belonged to Dr. Nick Smith, a data analyst at Seele.\n\nIn response, the startup started warning users not to send the scammers any money, and claimed full responsibility for what happened. Its message stated that it was doing everything it could to prevent a similar situation from occurring again. The message reads:\n\u201cIt appears as due to the intentional deceiving of the \u201c@nicsmith\u201d and \u201c@seelesupport\u201d scammer by impersonating one of our own team members, some people from our community have lost funds.

Seele, on the other hand, insists impersonators are responsible for what happened, as they weren\u2019t a part of Seele\u2019s team.\nScammers keep targeting ICO investors\nThe recent ICO craze has made potential investors juicy targets for scammers. Since most ICOs offer deals in their early stages, scammers manage to dupe investors by posing as startup representatives.\nIn this case, there may have been red flags users could\u2019ve noticed. According to Bitsonline, a simple Google search for the contact email behind the ICO\u2019s URL shows that the address, [email\u00a0protected], has in the past been associated with other scams, some dating as far back as 2014.\nAs reported by CCN, scammers have been targeting potential ICO investors lately. The Bee Token ICO recently derailed thanks to a phishing scam that saw nearly $1 million in Eth get stolen.

One article declared we\u2019d come to \u201cThe end of the market\u2019s Trump honeymoon\u201d, others are analyzing not whether or not major correction is underway, but whether or not the correction will lead to a \u201cmultiyear bear market\u201d. The change in sentiment is startling, and it\u2019s been almost perfectly mimicked by the crypto market. Watching this play out has caused two questions to arise: firstly how strong the correlation between traditional financial markets and the cryptocurrency markets is and secondly\u00a0if the correlation exists what the implications of today could be for cryptocurrencies.\nThe Correlation Question:\nDisclaimer: This part of the article gets a little technical.The tl;dr here is while the correlation between the markets themselves is weak, there\u2019s a noteworthy correlation between the sentiments of the two markets. I explain the implications of that correlation in the section following this one.\nImages like this infamous one from the 2008 financial crisis have started to appear in bearish articles.\nWhile many, many attempts have been made to qualitatively correlate crypto markets and even imply causation\u00a0(a big no-no in quantitative analysis, relatively few attempts have been made to quantify the relationship. Aside from a few outdated articles, I\u2019ve found little. The best resource I was able to find on the subject was\u00a0Sifr Data, a free cryptocurrency data visualization tool. Among other visualizations, they have a cryptocurrency correlation matrix which shows the z-scores and p-scores of correlations between various assets.\nFor those of you who skipped statistics class as much as I did, the numbers in the first chart are called\u00a0z-scores.\u00a0They represent the direction and strength of the relationship between the two sets of data. A higher absolute z-score means greater correlation, while a lower absolute z-score means less of a correlation. Whether the number is positive or negative indicates whether the relationship is direct or inverse:\nZ-Score correlation matrix. It can be overwhelming but pay attention to two numbers in particular: BTC-S&P 500 (0.14) and S&P 500-VIX (-0.31)\nThe S&P 500, because of it\u2019s z-score, has a \u201cweak positive relationship\u201d to Bitcoin. This is hardly interesting and according to our matrix is not statistically significant\u00a0(check out the link for an explanation of why). Now let\u2019s look at the VIX z-score, the other number I mentioned above. It\u2019s a -0.31 making it a \u201cmoderate negative relationship\u201d. For those unaware VIX is an index of the volatility in the stock market and is also referred to as the \u201cfear-gauge\u201d. This means that there is a definite inverse correlation between VIX and Bitcoin. This was demonstrated quite well in an article\u00a0earlier this year which contained the following graph:\nA chart of VIX vs Bitcoin from earlier this year\nThis is an extremely interesting find. If true, it means that as fear in markets decreases bitcoins price increase.\u00a0 Conversely, as fear increases bitcoins prices decrease. This makes Bitcoin a risk-on\u00a0investment as opposed to more conservative investments like gold which are considered risk-off investments.\nIt also tells us that in a longer-term bear stock market cryptocurrencies will likely fare even more poorly than their stock counterparts. Conversely, in a bullish market, they will likely fair better.\nThe Correlation Plays Itself Out\nWith this correlation in mind, let\u2019s analyze the recent market trends which have caused this rise in the VIX (up 115% today) and try to figure out what\u2019s going on here. Today, the Dow Jones dropped 1,175 points constituting the single largest point drop in the measures 130+ year history. Nonetheless, because of the recent meteoric rise, percentage wise it only constituted a 4.6% drop. To give a measure of what this means for the markets, we can simply say that the Dow Jones has reversed all gains made in 2018. This alone, while bearish, is definitely still consequential. Unfortunately, the Dow Jones wasn\u2019t the only index hurting today with the DAX (based in Germany), FTSE\u00a0(based in the UK), and S&P (based in the US) all down sharply over the past few days. Looking at this combined with cryptos own 45% fall in recent weeks, you can see why the VIX is climbing and fear is driving the market.\nWhat\u2019s causing all this? Everyone has a theory, but there have been two rather nerve-racking causes. First of all the Federal Reserve\u2019s 10-year yield rate, which determines the interest rates the U.S. government and Americans pay on their debt has increased recently. Higher interest rates can lead to decreased consumer spending and can increase inflation, both rather bearish signals. This combined with some rather prominent economists/former Fed Chairman (I\u2019m looking at you, Greenspan) declaring that we\u2019re entering a \u201cmassive multiyear bear market\u201d have driven VIX through the roof. In the world of crypto, this fear mongering is combined with the recent price fall, crypto\u2019s notoriously panicky retail investors, and general FUD and you end up with what could become a long bear market.\nI hope I\u2019m wrong, and maybe I am. Hope is probably the best I can do. As we now know: market sentiment, more than anything else, drives the price of cryptocurrencies. I anticipate an interesting few weeks ahead of us.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

So is the fiat world.\nFinding Rock Bottom\nEven most beginner investors are aware of the old adage \u2018buy low, sell high\u2019. The question is, when will low be low enough? The truth is no one really knows. Looking at the above chart, Bitcoin\u2019s worst crash lasted 411 days, ending in January of 2015. The nose dive sent bitcoin\u2019s price plummeting 87%.\nAs of today, the price is down 64.5% in just the last 51 days. If that happened in the stock market, news media outlets would call it 2008 all over again. Of course much of the global economic crisis a decade ago was due to the American government handing out subprime mortgages to consumers who couldn\u2019t afford to pay for the homes they were living in.\nIn the case of cryptocurrency, increased regulation is the reason for the crash. That\u2019s definitely bad news for short-term investors. Those bullish on the long-run however see regulation as a necessary step in the continuing fight to legitimize cryptocurrency and bring it further into the land of mass adoption.\nGood luck riding the rollercoaster no matter what your investment vehicle of choice.", "category": "Bitcoin Price News"}

Is \u201cany action\u2026being considered to ban the trading of bitcoin currency or cryptocurrency\u2026?\u201d was one of the questions posed.\n\u201cCryptocurrencies are an experiment,\u201d Singapore\u2019s deputy PM explained, stating their numbers had grown internationally and are currently at a nascent stage. Claiming it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to state if cryptocurrencies will succeed, the minister who oversees Singapore\u2019s central bank, suggested that the \u201cfull implications\u201d of cryptocurrencies will take time to understand if they do succeed in society.\nMore pointedly, however, is a standout statement from the deputy PM who stated in response to the questions of a ban akin to China\u2019s own crackdown:\n\u201cThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) [Singapore\u2019s central bank] has been closely studying these developments and the potential risks they pose. As of now, there is no strong case to ban cryptocurrency trading here. But we will be subjecting those involved as intermediaries to our anti-money laundering regulations.\u201d\nThe remarks ring similar to those offered by the MAS managing director Ravi Menon last year. Bitcoin itself doesn\u2019t pose any risks requiring regulation, the central bank chief said at the time, instead pointing to regulation of intermediaries like exchange operators who would have to comply with existing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.\n\u201cThere are two main uses of cryptocurrencies today. The first is as a means of payment,\u201d the deputy PM continued in his remarks yesterday. \u201cThe second, which has become far more prominent, is where cryptocurrencies are assets in their own right. People are trading in them in the hope of making a profit.\u201d\nFurthermore, the official went on to reveal ongoing efforts toward regulating cryptocurrency exchanges that will see cryptocurrencies like bitcoin under a singular legislation of retail payment services alongside public cautions of risks in cryptocurrency investments. \u201cThe big fall in bitcoin prices in recent weeks illustrates the risk,\u201d the deputy PM added yesterday.\nStill, the senior Singaporean official stressed that the country\u2019s authorities will adopt an embracive and cautious approach to cryptocurrencies going forward.\nHe stated:\n\u201cWe will continue to encourage experiments in the blockchain space that may involve the use of cryptocurrencies, because some of these innnovations could turn out to be economically or socially useful.

Christopher Giancarlo, respectively, were readying their testimony before lawmakers. Based on an early glimpse of their prepared remarks, the regulators are expected to testify that the cryptocurrency markets are in need of more stringent federal oversight versus the patchwork state-based rules that currently exist. Chief among the concerns are investor protection issues surrounding bitcoin and altcoins.\nThe call for greater regulatory oversight is adding fuel to a fire that has already been flamed by a clampdown on crypto trading in other countries, such as China, India and South Korea, all of which has been exacerbated by the ban that top US banks placed on bitcoin purchases via credit cards in recent days.\nRegulators Request Greater Authority\nBased on his prepared remarks, the CFTC\u2019s Giancarlo is expected to say that while there\u2019s no shortage of opinion on bitcoin, much of it boils down to perspective. He compares the market cap of bitcoin, which has shrunk in recent sessions to less than that of McDonald\u2019s $132 billion, not to mention the total size of the gold market at some $8 trillion. Nonetheless, the attention on \u201cvirtual currencies far outweighs \u201cits size and magnitude in today\u2019s global economy.\u201d\n\nDespite its relative size, the current regulatory framework can\u2019t contain cryptocurrency trading, as per Clayton, who is expected to say:\n\u201cThe currently applicable regulatory framework for cryptocurrency trading was not designed with trading of the type we are witnessing in mind.\u201d\nTill now, and with the exception of fraudulent activity that\u2019s been uncovered, Congress has been largely mum on cryptocurrencies, leaving regulators to do their jobs. But the SEC and CFTC have their hands tied when it comes to protecting investors from illegal cryptocurrency activity based on the current laws, they suggest. New legislation would likely have to be crafted in order for\u00a0the scope of\u00a0regulators\u2019 jurisdiction on\u00a0virtual currencies to be expanded.\nMeanwhile, the ability of exchanges such as Chicago\u2019s CME and CBOE to launch new products such as bitcoin futures without the CFTC\u2019s interference is now being questioned for \u201cnovel\u201d assets like bitcoin, which could lead to more hand-holding and data sharing between the exchanges and regulators.\nAn already jittery bitcoin bunch are closely monitoring the response on Capitol Hill to Clayton\u2019s and Giancarlo\u2019s testimony, both of whom have already admitted to being \u201cdisturbed\u201d about the current state of the market.", "category": "News"}

However, users only take advantage of this feature if they use SegWit-compatible wallet addresses.\nAccording to data from hardware wallet manufacturer Trezor, only about 15 percent of Bitcoin transactions currently employ SegWit, down from a high of about 18 percent in late January. This recent reduction could be linked to users taking advantage of lower transaction fees to move funds from legacy addresses to SegWit-compatible ones, but in any case it is clear that the network is not experiencing the full benefits that the scaling upgrade offers, in part because Coinbase and a few other large firms have been slow to implement it.\nSource: Segwit.party\nThese companies \u2014 Coinbase in particular due to its ubiquity as an on-ramp into the ecosystem \u2014 had been roundly criticized by many in the community because although they supported the controversial SegWit2x proposal, citing rising transaction fees, they appeared to drag their feet on implementing SegWit.\nThis lack of urgency incurred the ire of more than just Coinbase customers. Sergej Kotliar, CEO of mobile top-up service Bitrefill, noted that the number of unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions plummeted at the same time that Coinbase was experiencing an outage, which suggests that Coinbase transactions were heavily responsible for network congestion that contributed to rising Bitcoin transaction fees near the height of the market\u2019s rally.\nSource: Twitter\nIn a December blog post, the company responded to these criticisms by stating that adding new features was third on its list of engineering priorities, behind securing customer funds and keeping its platform stable during periods of peak volume \u2014 a goal it has often failed to achieve during market volatility.\n\u201cWe store billions of dollars worth of bitcoin on behalf of customers and any change to our infrastructure is done with significant planning and consideration for the security and stability of our platform,\u201d the company said.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

Zug, Switzerland-based bitcoin wallet startup Bread unveiled plans to accept international bitcoin purchases via credit card. Bread is boasting features such as \u201chigh limits\u201d and same-day delivery for bitcoin purchases, both of which are often missing from cryptocurrency exchanges. By allowing this service, which is a product of a relationship with Simplex, investors can bypass cryptocurrency exchanges, which incidentally top US banks have taken aim at of late.\nBread tweeted \u2013\n\nWhile Bread is making it easier for investors to get their hand on bitcoin, banks are making it more difficult. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Lloyd\u2019s\u00a0in recent days placed a ban on bitcoin purchases via credit card. Cryptocurrency exchanges appear to be tops on banks\u2019 radar for credit card bitcoin purchases.\nBread\u2019s decision, meanwhile, came in response to customer demand amid the following idiosyncracies with exchanges \u2013\n\ngetting \u201cverified\u201d on an exchange or online brokerage is a cumbersome and lengthy process\ndaily limits are modest for investors looking to acquire a significant position\nbitcoin delivery takes a painful minimum of one week with a bank account purchase\n\nThe Bread app, meanwhile, gives investors what they\u2019re missing from the likes of Coinbase \u2013\n\nsame day delivery of bitcoin\ndaily and monthly limits of $20,000 and $50,000, respectively\nUser identification is completed on the Bread app, removing the need to juggle devices and copy/paste multiple addresses\n\nPerhaps the best feature of the Bread wallet is it puts the private key in the accountholder\u2019s hands, removing the need to\u00a0trust a third-party service provider, a decentralized approach that is similarly at the core of the blockchain. This is unlike exchanges, where if a buyer doesn\u2019t own their own digital wallet, the bitcoin is automatically kept in the exchange\u2019s wallet, which as the Coincheck showed the world can be a risky bet in the event of a breach.\nBread also draws the conclusion that fees are not an area of concern for investors, which crypto traders may take issue with, especially considering the highly anticipated launch of Robinhood. Bread\u2019s theory is that considering the volatility in the bitcoin price, a buyer\u2019s No. 1 concern when purchasing bitcoin is immediacy.

Bitcoin at the time of publishing was down about 15% to below the $7,000 threshold, dropping lower than even some of the worst-case scenarios.\nVenture-backed Bread came on the scene in 2015, with its own digital coin Bread (BRD) lower with the best of them, trading off more than 17%.\n", "category": "Bitcoin Wallets"}

He said that, if these rules are satisfied at a later date, the SEC will then be open to reviewing its stance on Bitcoin ETFs.\nChairman Giancarlo, meanwhile, won the hearts of Bitcoin enthusiasts with several comments that appeared to be hat tips to the community. First, he made what is almost certainly the first use of the word \u201chodl\u201d during a Congressional hearing. Then, toward the end of the hearing, he contradicted the common misconception that Bitcoin is riding the coattails of blockchain technology.\nHe told the committee:\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that if there was no Bitcoin, there would be no blockchain.\u201d\n\nAltogether, the hearing may not have led to any bombshells, but it confirmed what has already been made apparent: new cryptocurrency regulations are likely coming to the US market.\n\u201cWe may be back with our friends from the U.S. Treasury and the Fed to ask for additional legislation,\u201d Chairman Clayton said during the hearing, and \u2014 based on the tone of questions from individual committee members \u2014 legislators are likely to give it to them.", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

But, as Augur co-founder Joey Krug noted, there are not enough developers working on the core protocol of Ethereum and consequently, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stated that fully scaling Ethereum could take two to five years.\nBittrex Disables Deposits\nGiven the recent increase in the transaction fee of Ether, Bittrex has disabled Ether deposits onto its trading platform temporarily. As seen in the chart below provided by Etherscan, the transaction fee of Ether has increased drastically over the past week, forcing Bittrex to take an extreme approach by disabling Ether deposits onto its platform.\n\n\u201cDue to incredibly high gas prices, we\u2019re preventing new ETH and asset deposit addresses from being created. Existing deposit addresses will work as normal,\u201d said Bittrex.\nGas is the transaction fee paid by decentralized applications to execute operations. On CryptoKitties and EtherDelta for instance, users pay gas to trade digital cartoon kittens or to execute trades on the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange of EtherDelta.\nIf the gas costs increase due to the congestion on the Ethereum network, it becomes more inefficient and challenging for decentralized applications to operate seamlessly and handle millions of requests in a brief period of time. For this specific reason, Bittrex also disabled new Ether and asset deposit addresses from being created.\nOther major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Bithumb have not disabled Ether deposits and the creation of new deposit addresses. Considering the large number of unconfirmed transactions on the Ethereum network, it is likely that Bittrex will disable new deposit addresses from being deployed for a relatively long period of time. \nIt has also started to cost users more than $1 to send Ether from one address to another. While the current rate of Ether transaction fee could decrease in the short-term, until then, users on exchanges and decentralized applications will struggle.", "category": "Ethereum News"}

Now, the NIS has laid claim to have gathered enough evidence to suggest that North Korea was involved in the hack and subsequent theft that began with phishing emails targeting employees at the exchange.\nNorth Korea has been continually accused of cryptocurrency theft from South Korea and beyond in recent years, raising questions of a possible stockpiling of cryptocurrency by Kim Jong-Un\u2019s regime.

USD $90,000, every month from 2013-2015 to increase reserves of its hard (safe haven currency) as a means to nullify the effect of global economic sanctions.\nFrequent reports have pointed to South Korean exchanges as common targets, as a detailed report by cybersecurity firm FireEye firmly pointed the finger at North Korean hackers stealing bitcoin to fund Pyongyang\u2019s elite and Kim Jong UN\u2019s regime.\nIn December, South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Youbit filed for bankruptcy following the theft of 17% of its bitcoin reserves from its hot wallet.

The market valuation of Ethereum surpassed a staggering $100 billion, becoming the third cryptocurrency to do so apart from bitcoin and Ripple.\nMerely four days later, on January 8, Ether demonstrated another major increase in value, reaching $1,266 across all global exchanges such as Binance and Bittrex. \nThe latest rally of Ether has been led by the South Korean market and leading cryptocurrency exchanges within it, including Bithumb, Korbit, and Coinone. Within the South Korean global market, the price of Ether surpassed $1,800, demonstrating a $534 premium over the global average price. That is, a 29.6 percent premium over the global average Ether price.\nOn Bithumb, the Seoul-based cryptocurrency exchange which recently became the second largest trading platform behind Binance, Ethereum is the third most traded cryptocurrency with a $378 million daily trading volume. \nCryptocurrencies on Bithumb, South Korea\u2019s largest exchange\nNo specific event or movement has led to the increase in the price of Ether over the past few days. The transaction volume and developer activity of Ethereum have been on the rise in general, given that the Ethereum network is currently settling more than 1.2 million transactions per day. The rise in the user activity on the Ethereum network could have led to the price increase of Ether in the short-term.\nBut, in consideration of the abrupt surge in demand from the South Korean market, it is likely that FOMO or fear or missing out drove the recent price surge of Ether, as the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market is strongly driven by FOMO.\nOne minor factor that could have also triggered an increase in demand for Ether is the rise of adoption of decentralized applications like CryptoKitties and EtherDelta that have demonstrated the potential of Ethereum in peer-to-peer digital asset trading. \nArbitrage? Think Again\nAlthough the price of cryptocurrencies in the South Korean market is significantly higher than the global average rates, it is not possible for foreigners to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity in the South Korean market for many reasons:\n\nInvestors need mobile phone numbers to register on South Korean exchanges. South Korean telecoms do not issue (even prepaid sim cards) to individuals without Korean citizenship, residential visa, or work visa.\nInvestors need bank accounts. But, banks do not open bank accounts to foreigners without residential or work visa. Banks make it hard for citizens to open accounts as well, due to the governments\u2019 recent crackdown on offshore banking accounts and fraudulent bank accounts.\nThe South Korean government has banned foreigners and underaged investors from investing in cryptocurrencies. South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges cannot accept foreigners into their trading platforms.\n\nConclusively, the prices of cryptocurrencies in the South Korean market are high because of capital controls. The South Korean market is isolated from the global market and foreigners are not allowed in it. Conversely, South Korean traders cannot open accounts overseas without proper paperwork.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

The hackers were able to port his number to an account under their control on AT&T, and reset his account passwords most likely though SMS-based two-factor authentication.\nAccording to a recent report from Law360, Tapang\u2019s complaint involves targeting T-Mobile for their inability to provide adequate security measures to protect his account. The failure on the carrier\u2019s end allowed malicious actors to port Tapang\u2019s number out, and steal his cryptocurrency by gaining access to associated accounts.\n\u201cAs a result of this breach of security, Mr. Tapang\u2019s exchange account was subjected to unauthorized transfers; he was deprived of his use of his cell phone number and required to expend time, energy, and expense to address and resolve this financial disruption and mitigate the consequences; and he also suffered consequent emotional distress.\u201d\nHackers reportedly drained Tapang\u2019s accounts of the OmiseGo and Bitconnect tokens that he owned, and likely won\u2019t be returning them anytime soon.\nAlthough T-Mobile\u2019s sales and marketing materials claim that there are security measures in place to prevent these forms of attacks, it seems as if that wasn\u2019t the case with this recent breach.\nT-Mobile never added a pin to Tapang\u2019s account as requested, and hackers called the service repeatedly in order to reach a representative willing to make the transfer. After the porting, Tapang was unable to access his phone number and had to do whatever he could to secure his holdings and rescue his accounts.\nNumber-Jacking: A Growing Trend\nHacks of this nature began as early as 2016, with a case notably involving another T-Mobile customer that had his number changed and cryptocurrency stolen. The hackers transferred the number of the affected party to their control, reset his passwords, and took control of his exchange accounts in order to drain him of his holdings. As soon as the hackers had the phone number in their possession, resetting passwords on critical accounts was as easy as pushing a button.\nThe process involves calling up the targeted party\u2019s mobile provider and asking to port their number to a device in the hacker\u2019s possession. The hacker will pose as the targeted party, and provide any answers to security questions that they might have access to through a variety of means.\nOne of the major ways in which exchanges can prevent these types of hacks and further protect their customers is disabling two-factor authentication through SMS, and route it through a proprietary authentication application. Although not bulletproof, it may have the power to lessen the frequency of these cases in the future.\nAt the end of the day, users might have control of their physical devices, but their assigned phone numbers are in the control of their carrier.", "category": "Bitcoin Crime"}

But, its actually only down by 10 percent.\n\nCoinMarketCap Fiasco\nEarlier today, without prior notice or any reasonable explanation, CoinMarketCap removed the trading price of Ripple on South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges from the global average calculation of Ripple. \nThe removal of South Korean rates was controversial, primarily because the well-regulated South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market has been accountable for more than 50 percent of global Ripple trades over the past few weeks. Bithumb, the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency exchange with a $2.6 billion daily trading volume, processes $750 million worth of Ripple trades alone on a daily basis.\nThe decision of CoinMarketCap to suddenly remove South Korean rates was questionable because it has removed South Korean rates from all other cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. As such, the price of all cryptocurrencies that are concentrated in the South Korean market has decreased substantially.\nFor casual traders and especially newcomers, the abrupt removal of South Korean rates from Ripple\u2019s global average price seemed like a major correction and a panic sell-off. Ripple\u2019s chief cryptographer David Schwartz wrote:\n\u201cCoinmarketcap\u2019s decision to exclude Korean prices from the displayed XRP price made the price appear to drop, likely triggering some panic selling. Look closely at the data and don\u2019t be misled.\u201d\nSchwartz emphasized that the new price of Ripple, without the high premium rate of the South Korean market, is more meaningful.

Some, including Schwartz, stated that the removal of South Korean rates is beneficial for the market and for every cryptocurrency listed on CoinMarketCap since only a small portion of investors are affected by the premium rates in South Korea.\nIt is extremely difficult for foreigners to trade cryptocurrencies in the South Korean market and challenging for South Korean investors to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity. As such, the price of cryptocurrencies in the South Korean market is exclusive to local traders and investors. \nThe question about the rates from the South Korean market and whether they should be reflected on the global price of cryptocurrencies remains unanswered. While some experts believe it could make the ecosystem healthier, others believe that considering the sheer trading volume coming from the South Korean market, and strict regulations imposed by the government to regulate the sector, South Korean rates should be considered in calculating the global average price.\nBut, ultimately, due to strict capital controls, it is not possible for foreign traders to move South Korean won out of the local cryptocurrency sector.

One points to Microsoft following Steam\u2019s footsteps in no longer accepting Bitcoin. The rumor stems from a Bleeping Computer article that claims the software and hardware giant did halt Bitcoin payments.\nOn top of the thread, an r/Bitcoin admin stickied a post stating various users tried to find the Bitcoin payment option, but were unable to. His comment notes he believes it\u2019s \u201cclear that small retail payments don\u2019t make economic sense for Bitcoin right now,\u201d and that although everything points to the rumor being true, it is still unverified as there was no official statement on Microsoft\u2019s end.\nAnother top thread on Reddit claims Microsoft does still accept Bitcoin payments, and that shills are just trying to fill the subreddit with fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Per this thread, Microsoft allows users to add a predetermined amount of dollars to their balance using Bitcoin, so the tech giant does indirectly accept the flagship cryptocurrency.\nSo, which is it? To find out, we at CCN decided to try to make a purchase using Bitcoin. We quickly found out the Bitcoin payment option wasn\u2019t there. Refusing to pay with fiat, we contacted customer support.\nDoes Microsoft still accept Bitcoin?\nChatting with Microsoft\u2019s customer support, we were told the company no longer accepts Bitcoin as a payment option. Notably, the company has seemingly decided to stop accepting the cryptocurrency since July 2017.\n\nGive the unsatisfactory answer we were given, we pressed the issue and were connected to a member of the Higher support from Microsoft\u2019s Accounts and Billing team. He confirmed Microsoft has stopped accepting Bitcoin due to \u201cmultiple issues we are receiving with regards to it.\u201d When pressed, he revealed that \u201cthere\u2019s no other information cascaded to us on why Microsoft stopped accepting Bitcoin as a payment info aside from the problem processing the payments.\u201d\nMicrosoft still has a how-to page on its website explaining how users can top up their accounts with Bitcoin. Asked about this, we were told the process no longer works, as Microsoft stopped accepting Bitcoin.\nGiven that the company updated its systems to stop accepting the cryptocurrency back in July, when Bitcoin was still at about $2,500, we asked if the move was due to a lack of customer demand. We weren\u2019t given a lot of details, but we were told \u201c3 out of 5 customers\u201d were currently having issues with Bitcoin. Microsoft support further revealed that the company has \u201c3 escalations that the redeem Bitcoin is not reflecting on their Microsoft account.\u201d\nIt seems the cryptocurrency community is already making it clear people want to use Bitcoin as a payment method. As for our purchase, we refused to pay with fiat, and asked if this was about the current problems Bitcoin\u2019s network is facing, and if the company will accept Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency in the future. Here\u2019s the answer we got:\n\nNot the first time\nIt\u2019s worth noting this isn\u2019t the first time Microsoft stops accepting Bitcoin. As reported by CCN, the software and hardware giant put the breaks on cryptocurrency payments in 2016, Little after the company\u2019s move started making headlines, it apologized for what it deemed \u201cinaccurate information,\u201d and revealed Bitcoin would still be accepted.\nAt the time, the how-to detailing the process used to add money to a user\u2019s account using Bitcoin was still active, just like it still is now.

However, it took an eight percent hit this morning, forcing the combined value of all cryptocurrencies down to $755 billion.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nMost of that movement occurred at approximately 5:00 UTC, when market data aggregation outlet CoinMarketCap ceased to factor data from South Korean exchanges into its pricing algorithms. Since Korean exchanges tend to price coins and tokens at significant premiums \u2014 often 25 percent or more \u2014 the change made it appear that prices were plunging across the board, even though the actual movement was, in many cases, much more subdued.\nBitcoin Price Sinks Below $16,000\nThe bitcoin price had spent the weekend on a bullish upswing, and on Saturday the flagship cryptocurrency rose as high as $17,252 on Bitfinex. This brought bitcoin to its highest mark since December 21, and it appeared to signal that it was prepared to begin reclaiming its dominant market share.\nToday, however, the bitcoin price entered a precipitous decline, falling about nine percent to a present value of $15,475 on Bitfinex. This translates into a $261.5 billion market cap.\n24-Hour Bitcoin Price Chart\nBitcoin\u2019s decline came as South Korean media outlets reported that regulators were taking an \u201cintensive probe\u201d into bank accounts belonging to local cryptocurrency exchanges.\nEthereum Price Fights Against the Current\nWhile bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies fell, the ethereum price fought against the current to post a two percent gain. That\u2019s not to say the pullback did not deal ethereum a severe blow. Earlier in the day, the ethereum price had soared above $1,200\u00a0on Bitfinex to post a new all-time high, but it has since declined to $1,128.\n24-Hour Ethereum Price Chart\nNevertheless, ethereum remains in positive territory \u2014 at least as the time of writing \u2014 and its resilience has enabled it to reclaim the second position in the market cap rankings from ripple with a total valuation of just under $112 billion.\nRipple, meanwhile, saw its price decline about eight percent on Bittrex to $2.53. Its global price, however, shows a 21 percent drop on CoinMarketCap, primarily because the website has begun excluding South Korean spot prices \u2014 which are notoriously high due to local demand and capital controls \u2014 from its calculations.\n24-Hour Ripple Price Chart\nIt is unclear whether this will be a permanent change or if the website detected pricing anomalies on South Korean exchanges, but under the current algorithm ripple\u2019s market cap is listed at just $99.5 billion, which ranks third-largest among cryptocurrencies.\nAltcoin Markets Demonstrate Influence of South Korea\nThe absence of South Korean spot prices from CoinMarketCap\u2019s algorithm makes the market decline appear worse than it is, but most top cryptocurrencies did experience at least a minor decrease against the US dollar.\nSource: CoinCodex\nAccording to data from CoinCodex \u2014 which continues to factor South Korean pricing data into its calculations \u2014 the bitcoin cash price dropped by two percent to $2,684, and fifth-ranked cardano fell by seven percent to $0.93.\nNEM declined by one percent, while both litecoin and stellar dipped by four percent to bring their prices to $273 and $0.66, respectively.\nThe IOTA price managed to tread water, which was sufficient to raise it to ninth in the rankings, while TRON declined four percent to round out the top 10.\nWrite to Josiah Wilmoth at josiah.wilmoth(at)ccn.com.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

In a departure from ICO norms, Telegram plans to require supporters to contribute using fiat currency, not ether or bitcoin as most others do.\nThe project is apparently a personal one for Telegram co-founder and CEO Pavel Durov, who founded Russian social network VK but was forced to sell his stake by shareholders with powerful government connections.\nIn addition to its utility as a payments network, TON will also feature a DNS service to enable users to access decentralized services with an interface similar to that of a web page.\nAccording to a roadmap spelled out in the whitepaper, Telegram hopes to release a minimum viable product (MVP) as early as the first quarter of this year, though a full-featured platform will not be released until at least the second quarter of 2019.\nWrite to Josiah Wilmoth at josiah.wilmoth(at)ccn.com.", "category": "ICO News"}

Even for those petitions that earn enough signatures, the Brazilian government, at times, fails to uphold their constitutional obligation to review them.\n\u201cIn part this is due to the absence of a platform that can securely collect the signatures of one percent of voters,\u201d Universidade de Bras\u00edlia law professor Henrique Ara\u00fajo Costa stated.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor Ricardo Fernandes Paix\u00e3o and Everton Fraga, the duo behind the initiative, this is where Ethereum\u2019s Blockchain comes in. \u00a0Instead of circulating, signing, and verifying petitions by hand, the project heads want to run the entire process through Ethereum, storing signatures and records of these signatures on the protocol\u2019s blockchain. \u00a0To Peixoto, a World Bank specialist who holds that\u00a0there\u2019s no sure way to authenticate signatures under the current system, \u201c[this] is a workaround solution necessary due to the impossibility of verifying the authenticity of the signatures.\u201d\nHow It Will Work\nIn order to achieve Paix\u00e3o and Fraga\u2019s vision, the Brazilian congress is developing a mobile app. \u00a0After registering with the app, citizens can sign or create their own petitions using Ethereum\u2019s blockchain.\nOn a daily basis, individual signatures will be cryptographically hashed, and by day\u2019s end, these hashes will be sent as a single transaction to the Ethereum network.\u00a0 Hashing the signatures and sending them as a lump transaction reduces costs and network bloat, as sending each signature as a single transaction would likely be energy intensive and inefficient\nOnce a transaction is added to the blockchain, signatories can review their individual hashes on the blockchain. \u00a0\u201cAnyone can audit the system,\u201d Paix\u00e3o, the congressional legislative adviser described. \u201cEach day, you can prove from cryptographic proof that a certain signature is already there.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nThe project, which has been in development since 2017, is still awaiting congressional approval. If it were to succeed, the development \u201cwould be a celebration of democracy,\u201d according to Fraga, the designer and developer spearheading the project with Paix\u00e3o. \u201cWith this project, we are doing what the constitution says, but in practice, it hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d\nIf Brazil implements Ethereum into their electoral project, they will be the first government to use blockchain technology for public functions. \u00a0Meanwhile, Sweden has looked to blockchain to solve problems in the private sector, such as land registry and title deeds.", "category": "Blockchain News"}

The vulnerabilities, dubbed Meltdown and Spectre by their finders, exploit weaknesses in the computer processors (CPUs) used in most of the world\u2019s PCs, smartphones, and data hubs. \u00a0These developments have raised questions the world over about the security of private data, leaving the cryptocurrency community wondering what this may mean for the safety of personal wallet funds and exchange reserves.\nImplications for the Crypto Realm\nTogether, Meltdown and Spectre attacks can affect processing chips produced by Intel, AMD, and ARM, and its discoverers have called them \u201cthe worst GPU bugs ever found.\u201d\u00a0 According to the researchers who discovered the flaws, the attacks can steal information from services and applications that a computer\u2019s GPU processes:\n\u201cThese hardware vulnerabilities allow programs to steal data which is currently processed on the computer. While programs are typically not permitted to read data from other programs, a malicious program can exploit Meltdown and Spectre to get hold of secrets stored in the memory of other running programs. This might include your passwords stored in a password manager or browser, your personal photos, emails, instant messages and even business-critical documents.\u201d\nMichael Schwarz, one of the vulnerabilities\u2019 discoverers, illustrates how Meltdown works in a visual tweet:\n\nUsing #Meltdown to steal passwords in real time #intelbug #kaiser #kpti /cc @mlqxyz @lavados @StefanMangard @yuvalyarom https://t.co/gX4CxfL1Ax pic.twitter.com/JbEvQSQraP\n\u2014 Michael Schwarz (@misc0110) January 4, 2018\n\nThese vulnerabilities could have unfortunate consequences for cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts. As one CoinKorea post points out, \u201cthe biggest problem is that if an attacker exploits the vulnerability, it can not be blocked by encryption or vaccination.\u201d \u00a0As such, encrypted wallets may offer little protection against such hacks, even if cryptocurrency investors are taking the utmost precautions.\nThe vulnerabilities could present obstacles to exchanges, too, as they already have. \u00a0Last week, Bittrex tweeted that wallet functions were restricted while Microsoft was overhauling its Azure cloud service to protect against the security flaws. \u00a0Bittrex, like many exchanges, uses the cloud to store hot wallet reserve funds for its customers. \u00a0Keeping a ledger of private keys in such a centralized place has raised eyebrows within the community, as cloud services are just as vulnerable to Meltdown and Spectre as personal devices.\nIntel on Hot Water\nDespite news surfacing for the public just last week, CEO Brian Krzanich revealed in a CNBC interview that Intel was \u201cmade aware of this issue a while back from researchers at Google.\u201d \u00a0According to a Google Cloud blog post, Project Zero, one of Google\u2019s tech research teams, knew of the vulnerabilities as early as June of last year.\nSome might say that seven months ago is more than \u201ca while back\u201d as Krzanich\u2019s statement suggests. \u00a0To make matters more complicated, Krzanich reportedly sold off $24mln worth of Intel stocks and options in November. \u00a0After the sell-off, the CEO was left with 250,000 shares, the bare minimum as per his employment agreement with the company. \u00a0\nA company spokesperson held that \u201cBrian\u2019s sale is unrelated\u201d to Meltdown and Spectre and that Krzanich \u201ccontinues to hold shares in line with corporate guidelines.\u201d\nHow You Can Protect Yourself\nThere are software patches available to protect against both Meltdown and Spectre, and experts recommend that users update their systems immediately to accommodate these fixes.\nAdditionally, if you\u2019re worried about the security of your funds, it\u2019s best to never leave a substantial sum of funds on an exchange for an extended period of time.\nWhen handling your funds personally, there are a number of storage options that offer enhanced security compared to software and web wallets. \u00a0If you want your funds completely divorced from technological breaches, a paper wallet is a safe bet\u2013just make sure you backup your private keys and keep it in a secure place with little risk for damage. \u00a0Moreover, hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano S provide excellent security against malware, hackings, and system vulnerabilities. \n\nLedger products are not vulnerable to the latest Meltdown & Spectre attacks.

Among the subsidiary\u2019s authorized is Bitmain chief executive and co-founder Jihan Wu, according to information from Zug\u2019s commercial register.\nA friendlier jurisdiction and a regulatory embrace are seeing an ever-expanding number of startups and companies from the blockchain and cryptocurrency space establish their headquarters in the region. \u00a0Home to the government-backed \u2018Crypto Valley\u2019 association, the city of Zug also allows citizens to pay for municipal services with bitcoin.\nBitmain\u2019s entry into Switzerland comes amid ongoing curbs on bitcoin mining operations in China. Led by the People\u2019s Bank of China, the country\u2019s central bank, authorities are looking to scale down the energy-intensive process of bitcoin mining domestically by negating favorable policies such as tax cuts and cheap hydroelectric power tariffs offered to bitcoin miners in various Chinese provinces. While the move isn\u2019t a sweeping crackdown, Chinese authorities are surely phasing out the local mining ecosystem, forcing miners like Bitmain to look for friendlier pastures.\nAfter setting up subsidiaries in the United States, Singapore and Israel, Bitmain chose Switzerland\u2019s Zug as its next global hub because Switzerland is \u201cone of the most progressive countries\u2026with good legal stability\u201d, a spokesman for the company told the publication.\nNotably, Beijing-based Bitmain added:\n\u201cBitmain Switzerland will play a key role in our global expansion.\u201d\nFurther, Bitmain said it will set out to hire employees in Zug and will \u201cactively communicate\u201d and co-operate with Switzerland\u2019s Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and other regulatory organizations and government authorities in the region.", "category": "Bitcoin Companies"}

Within hours, the cryptocurrency market cap had plunged approximately $100 billion, and the market eventually bottomed out at $628.5 billion.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nBefore long, though, the market began to recover. Korea\u2019s Ministry of Strategy and Finance held a press conference in which the agency told reporters that the Ministry of Justice was acting on its own and the proposal had not been agreed upon by the country\u2019s cryptocurrency task force, which includes a broad range of agencies including these ministries as well as the central bank.\n\u201cWe do not share the same views\u2026on a potential cryptocurrency exchange ban,\u201d the Ministry of Strategy and Finance said.\nSince this press conference, the cryptocurrency market cap has recovered by more than $40 billion, although it has thus far failed to reach the level at which it was trading before the initial report that the Ministry of Justice was still seeking a blanket trading ban.\nBitcoin Price Recovers After Sub-$13,000 Dip\nThe market turmoil caused the bitcoin price to tumble to a low of $12,639 on Bitfinex, a 16 percent drop from its daily high of $14,999.

The ethereum price is currently trading at $1,150 at Bitfinex, down from a high of $1,332 on Wednesday. Ethereum now has a market cap of $114.4 billion.\n24-Hour Ethereum Price Chart\nEOS Headlines an Otherwise-Sour Day\nThe majority of altcoins joined bitcoin and ethereum in posting moderate declines, but a few cryptocurrencies managed to make positive movement.\n\nThird-ranked ripple continued its mid-week downtrend, falling six percent to reduce its market cap to $66.7 billion. Bitcoin cash, conversely, managed to rise by six percent and lift its market cap to $42.4 billion. Cardano, litecoin, NEM, and dash all fell between three and five percent, while EOS and IOTA joined bitcoin cash in posting single-day advances.\nThe IOTA price rose three percent for the day to $3.49, bringing its market cap to within a few hundred million of the $10 billion milepost.

Using the cryptocurrency, photographers and agencies will be able to register their images on a distributed ledger and then license them on KODAKOne, the company\u2019s upcoming proprietary blockchain platform, which will be developed through a licensing partnership with WENN Digital.\nThough just announced this week, Kodak has already begun accepting pre-initial coin offering (ICO) investments. Global Blockchain Technologies Corp., a Canadian firm based out of Vancouver, revealed that it has subscribed for all 8 million KODAKCoins that were made available during the first of two pre-ICO stages, for a reported sum of $2 million. The full ICO will commence on Jan. 31 and will be open to accredited investors.\nKodak Launching Branded Bitcoin Mining Rigs in Licensing Deal\nIn addition to developing its own cryptocurrency, Kodak has licensed its name to create the KashMiner, a Kodak-branded mining rig.\nAccording to CNBC, a two-year lease on the machine will cost $3,400, and the company estimates that it will produce a monthly revenue of $375 worth of bitcoins, or $9,000 over the course of the lease.\nThere\u2019s a catch, however. In addition to paying the $3,400 lease, users will be required to return half of the profits to Kodak, reducing their estimated revenue from $9,000 to $4,500.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! Kodak\u2019s estimates assume that the miners will earn consistent monthly revenue over the course of the two-year lease, which ignores the fact that bitcoin\u2019s mining has lately been increasing at a monthly rate of about 15 percent. Consequently, some industry observers doubt that users will even be able to recoup the value of their $3,400 investment, much less turn a profit.\n\nKodak is selling a Bitcoin miner where you pay for a two year contract and \u201cmake a profit\u201d.

Since announcing the news earlier this week, Kodak stock has more than tripled to $10.70 from a previous level of $3.15.", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

By Saturday evening, the bitcoin price had soared to $17,252 on Bitfinex, its highest mark since December 21 and an increase of nearly $4,000 from where it began the year.\nBTC Price Chart\nHowever, shortly after reaching this mark the bitcoin price entered a steep decline, and at the time of writing on Monday, it was trading at just $14,989 \u2014 a 13 percent decline from its Saturday peak.\nSouth Korea Inspects Exchange Bank Accounts\nThe decline appears to be at least partially linked to a report from regional media outlet Yonhap that South Korean regulators are planning to conduct an \u201cintensive probe\u201d into bank accounts belonging to South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe inspections, which will be overseen by the Financial Services Commission (FSC), seek to determine whether banks have complied with anti-money laundering policies when servicing domestic bitcoin exchanges, which have reportedly deposited more than 2 trillion won ($1.8 billion) at Korean banks.\nThe probe comes as regulators have sought to tighten inflows of fiat currency into Korean exchanges and curb the country\u2019s heated cryptocurrency markets, which often price coins and tokens at excessive premiums relative to their global average prices.\nTraders are clearly concerned about what regulators will find when they conduct their inspections, as well as how they will respond if they deem an account to be non-compliant. Korean officials have not ruled out shutting cryptocurrency exchanges down in the future for failing to comply with regulations, so the move could result in a turbulent week for the markets as traders await an official report.\nNotably, this uncertainty appears to have dwarfed other bullish announcements, the most significant of which is that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has filed to list leveraged Bitcoin ETFs on its Arca trading platform, an event that would further cement cryptocurrency as a mainstream asset class.\nWrite to Josiah Wilmoth at josiah.wilmoth(at)ccn.com.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Venezuela has the world\u2019s largest oil reserves for any single country. The petro, Maduro said at the time, would also be backed by other commodities like gold and diamonds alongside oil. The petro would be useful to combat economic sanctions due to a \u2018US-led blockade\u2019, the Venezuelan president claimed, helping the country regain access to global commerce.\nJust days ago, Maduro announced the issuance of 100 million petros, wherein each digital token will be directly valued to and backed by a single Venezuelan oil barrel. At effectively $6 billion in current prices, the issuance will come in the days following Maduro\u2019s other announcement \u2013 the petro\u2019s first national meeting of miners planned on January 14.\nHaving panned the endeavor ever since its announcement, Maduro\u2019s political opposition have now turned up their scrutiny of the petro by declaring it to be \u201ca forward sale\u201d of the country\u2019s oil rather than a cryptocurrency.\nIn the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, the country\u2019s opposition-run parliament on Tuesday claimed that any issue of the petro would violate constitutional requirements that mandates the legislature approve any borrowing against the country\u2019s oil wealth.

All cryptocurrencies listed on fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea such as Bithumb and Korbit are at least 20 percent more expensive than other markets.\nThe disparity in the trading price of cryptocurrencies between South Korean and other leading regions is caused by the lack of volume in South Korea and the country\u2019s extremely strict capital controls. It is not possible for foreigners to open bank accounts within the country without permanent residency visa, and it is also not legal to carry more than $10,000 worth of fiat currency outside of South Korea.\nAs such, taking advantage of the South Korean market\u2019s premium rates is not possible. The crackdown on foreigners in trading cryptocurrencies will make it even harder for traders outside of the South Korean market to try take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity.\nIn South Korea, and on local exchanges, traders need three important components to trade fiat-to-cryptocurrency. A mobile phone, a bank account, and verification. Foreign traders that have claimed they have been able to open accounts on Bithumb are either not verified or not allowed to process fiat-to-cryptocurrency trades, because in order to do so, a South Korean bank account is necessary.\nSouth Korean banks do not even provide bank accounts to the country\u2019s citizens that do not have a stable source of income, job security, and wealth, because of the government\u2019s crackdown on fraudulent bank accounts and offshore accounts. \nWithout a South Korean bank account\u2013which is nearly impossible for a foreign trader to open without a permanent job or residential visa in South Korea\u2013it is extremely difficult to send bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency to South Korea, take advantage of the premium rate, sell the cryptocurrency to South Korean won, and transfer it to elsewhere.\n\nHere\u2019s why it is not possible to sell #cryptocurrency in Korea for arbitrage.\n1. Foreigners are banned from trading crypto.\n2. Korean mobile phone needed. Can\u2019t obtain without long-term visa. (not even prepaid)\n3. Extremely difficult to obtain bank accounts, even for citizens.\n\u2014 Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) January 8, 2018\nThe only way it could work is to have a South Korean trader with a fully verified account as a proxy. But, that would be illegal. Sending money outside of South Korea without notifying the authorities, especially if the sum of the amount is big, is in violation of the South Korea financial authority\u2019s capital controls and anti-money laundering (AML) policies.\nHighly Inefficient and Illegal\nThere exists a clear reason as to why the premiums in the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market are substantially higher than other regions. South Korean investors are not foolish to purchase cryptocurrency at higher rates, they simply do not have other choices.\nConclusively, taking advantage of the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market could lead to one of these three situations: violation of AML policies and financial regulations, extremely inefficient process of physically bringing $10,000 out of the country every time an arbitrage occurs, or putting a South Korean proxy trader at risk of illicit trading and financial activity.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

The Dollar is the Real Bubble No One Talks About", "url": "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-dollar-real-bubble-no-one-talks/", "birthday": "2018-01-10T12:43:18+00:00", "date": "2018-01-10 12:43:18", "year": 2018, "month": 1, "day": 10, "content": "The meteoric rise of Bitcoin in 2017 is by almost everyone dismissed as a bubble. But it is not the only one. In a world where stocks, bonds, objects of art, classic cars and real estate are also at record highs, an investor should ask himself a very important question. Why? Why we have this bubble across all asset classes simultaneously? Could it be that this is just a sign? But a sign of what? One answer is \u201cThe most worrying sign of the implosion of the current monetary system awash with debt and credit creation\u201c. As dramatic as it may sound \u2013 and likely be \u2013 there are lots of signs for the attentive investor to notice. \nInvesting with a medium- to long-term horizon is all about looking at the big picture, at geopolitical shifts which slowly but irreversibly change consolidated equilibriums and move money around the world in and out of different asset classes. Recently, Macrovoices.com published an interview titled \u201cAnatomy of the US dollar end-game\u201d with Jeffrey Snider (Alhambra Partners), Mark Yusko (Morgan Creek Capital) and Luke Gromen (The Forest for the Trees). By the way, Mark Yusko and Luke Gromen were also among the very few money managers who were right in making the call for a depreciating US dollar in 2017. This is a summary of the conclusions drawn, for an understanding of the arguments behind it, listen to the full interview. \n\n The Crisis of the Euro-dollar Market\n\nAccording to Jeffrey Snider, Head of Global Investment Research at Alhambra Partners, the Euro-dollar market \u2013 a short-term money market facilitating banks\u2019 borrowing and lending of U.S. dollars outside the US \u2013 does not function properly since 2007 and it has essentially morphed into a US dollar \u201cshort squeeze\u201d generated by a scarcity of dollars. Even if this mechanically means tides of \u201ca rising dollar or a falling counterpart currency\u201d in the short term, it is not a net positive-bullish for the US dollar as a reserve currency. What happened in 2014 could happen again and would trigger another dangerous liquidity crisis at a moments notice.\n\n The US Debt Problem\n\nThe US debt and unbalances have never been a problem. Up until the world economy runs with US dollars and world central banks keep buying treasuries and the world energy markets are priced in dollars, then there is no problem. But now, because of geopolitical shifts out of the US dollar and US treasuries, this debt starts to matter. And the most likely way to deal with the debt problem for the US will be to ultimately devalue its currency, through inflation. \n\n Abandoning the Petrodollar System\n\nFor Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek Capital and Luke Gromen of Forest for the Trees, China and Russia are both actively seeking to reduce their dollar requirements. For them, the reliance on the dollar is a chronic problem that must be solved and it has morphed into a national security issue. Therefore they are moving in a number of directions to both increase the dollar supply, while at the same time decrease the dollar demand by \u2013 for example \u2013 repricing oil into CNY. They also do bilateral trade, as well as trade with African partners or other Eurasian countries along the OBOR (One Belt One Road), in non-dollar terms. Another example, the Chinese lent US dollars to African countries and were repaid in oil last year, basically converting Euro-dollars into oil. Since Russia (with Saudi Arabia) is the biggest oil producer and China is the biggest consumer, the two partners have started in 2014 transacting oil in non-dollar terms. In addition, a new Oil Futures contract denominated in CNY was announced last year and started test trading in Shangai in December. As one of the interviewed puts it: \u201d Oil has been the currency of choice to back up the US$ fiat since we closed the gold window. If the flow of oil could be persuaded by the efforts of the various nations not to be denominated in dollars, that will affect the world\u00b4s global financial flows more than anything else. Because oil is the world\u00b4s most traded and the largest dollar based commodity\u201d.\n4. The Role of Gold as a Neutral Settlement Asset\nThe idea is nothing new. Already in 2010, Robert Zoellik at the World Bank called for the biggest 5 currencies in the world to be linked to gold. In 2011 Dominque Strauss Kahn did the same as head of the IMF, calling for the link between SDR\u00b4s and gold. Luke Gromen highlighted that the news is that the Chinese are now actively moving in this direction. In 2013 they announced to stop stockpiling US FX reserves and have imported physical gold. The same is valid for Russia and when this is linked to the oil trade, this may shift the oil trade from the Petrodollar to a new Oil-Gold system. As Luke Gromen puts it: \u201cRussia bought gold the whole time now \u2013 unlike in \u201898, unlike in \u201808 \u2013 and the price of one ounce of gold in oil barrels more than doubled. It went from 13 barrels of oil per one ounce of gold to 30 barrels of oil per ounce. So if Russia got say 1,000 tons, then guess what has happened to the value of their gold reserves in terms of their largest economic output, oil? They\u2019re richer. Their reserves rose. You see, what they\u2019re doing makes their economy unsinkable and moves them irreversibly away from the dollar. And I think they\u2019re being patient and playing the long term game. They know that all they\u2019ve got to do is just continue doing this game and the dollar will collapse under its own weight. They don\u2019t need to be aggressive.\u201d \nTherefore patience seems to be the name of the game here for China and Russia. And they both know very well how to play it. \n\n Effect on Asset Prices\n\nThere was also unanimous consent on the effect that these big monetary system transitions have on asset prices, in the sense that they are extraordinarily inflationary to the currency that\u2019s losing status. Simply put, for Luke Gromen, \u201cwhat you\u2019re seeing in equity markets, what you\u2019re seeing in Bitcoin, what you\u2019re seeing in Da Vinci\u2019s and what you\u2019re seeing in real estate \u2013 the everything bubble \u2013 is a completely rational response to the dollar bubble\u201d. \nIndeed, just note that the very same is at this moment happening to the stock market in Venezuela, as it has happened before in Argentina and in the Weimar republic. \n\n Conclusions\n\nWhen the discussion gets to the point of analyzing where we currently stand in this transition to a new monetary system or which will be the best road to it, the opinions are diverging. The followings are to be closely monitored to gauge how fast the demise of the dollar \u2013 as the global reserve currency \u2013 progresses: \n\n the open interest and the volumes on the new CNY denominated Oil Futures contract, when it will start trading; \n if the decoupling of the usual relationship between interest rate differentials and the dollar index continues like in 2017. In other words, if treasury yields are going up at the same time that the dollar index is going down, things are getting serious; \n the holdings of US denominated reserves held by global central banks (and particularly by China, Russia and Saudi). Their holdings of US dollar-denominated reserves have peaked already in 2014 and have been on a slow but steady decline since then. Further declines will signal problems for the US to continue sustain its current levels of indebtedness; \n If the \u201ceverything asset bubble\u201d in the US keeps growing (emerging market style). \n\nFinally, how should an investor invest in such a scenario? The three money managers agree to invest in gold, real assets, handpicked undervalued stocks and, hold your breath\u2026 yes, Bitcoin. Because the mother of all the bubbles could well be the dollar and not Bitcoin.\nAbout the Author\nAndrea Bianconi is an international business Lawyer with over two decades experience, a scholar of Austrian Economics, Monetary History and Geopolitics, a believer in the future of Blockchain based technologies and an active member of Berlin\u2019s cutting edge Blockchain Hub, a legal consultant to Blockchain businesses, an investor himself and online trader with interest in commodities, precious metals, currencies, Tech stocks and Cryptos. \u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-bianconi-blockchain-law/", "category": "Guest Contributor"}

According to a Nikkei report, the information provider will invest its own money aside from raising capital from other two unnamed publicly-listed FinTech companies with a launch target of over 300 million yen (approx. $2.66 million).\nThe first-of-its-kind fund in Japan will focus on investments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and is reportedly set to launch before the end of January. Fisco is aiming for a target of 20% in investment returns from the fund, every year.\nFurther, the fund will also seek to make profits through arbitrage opportunities by looking into price differentials of cryptocurrencies among domestic and foreign exchanges.\nFisco has been an early mover in researching and adopting cryptocurrencies. Earlier in August 2017, the information provider\u2019s cryptocurrency unit issued three-year debt worth 200 bitcoins (approx. $800,000 at the time), to another firm under the Fisco group. Fisco\u2019s chief product officer Masayuki Tashiro revealed the intent of the cryptocurrency debt sale was to explore the bitcoin bonds\u2019 potential as a viable fundraising tool.

Mitsubishi UFJ Trust, the group\u2019s trust bank, has already applied for relevant patents and is geared for a tentative launch in April 2018, after Japan\u2019s financial regulator recognizes bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as financial assets akin to securities and real estate that can be placed and secured in a trust.", "category": "Bitcoin & Blockchain Investments"}

The move, first reported by Bleeping Computer, was confirmed by the company\u2019s customer support team to CCN.\nAccording to a company spokesperson, Microsoft seemingly decided to halt bitcoin payments in July 2017, due to \u201cmultiple issues\u201d they were receiving. When pressed, customer support revealed a problem with processing bitcoin payments. Despite Microsoft\u2019s move, a how-to page remained up its website explaining how users could top up their accounts with the cryptocurrency.\nThe how-to page, and the lack of an official announcement, led many to believe Microsoft restore bitcoin payments in the future. This was notably not the first time the tech giant halted bitcoin payments, as in 2016 it announced the cryptocurrency was no longer accepted. Little after publishing the announcement, the company apologized for what it deemed \u201cinaccurate information\u201d and revealed the flagship cryptocurrency would still be accepted.\nThis time, once again, it didn\u2019t take long for Microsoft to restore bitcoin payments. The company\u2019s statement reads:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve restored bitcoin as a payment option in our store after working with our provider to ensure lower bitcoin amounts would be redeemable by customers.\u201d\nMicrosoft began accepting bitcoin back in 2014 via BitPay. At the time, the move was met with much fanfare, as it joined other tech giants accepting the flagship cryptocurrency. The tech giant\u2019s move comes at a time in which JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, admitted he \u201cregrets\u201d his now infamous remark from last year, when he called bitcoin a \u201cfraud.\u201d\nThe move makes it clear Microsoft isn\u2019t following Valve\u2019s footsteps, as its popular gaming and digital distribution platform Steam stopped accepting bitcoin payments due to high fees and volatility last year.

While speaking on CNBC\u2019s \u201cFutures Now,\u201d the Wall Street strategist even considered the possibility of seeing bitcoin triple in 2018.\nAs reported by CCN, Lee initially set his bitcoin price target for $11,500 for mid-2018, and then increased it to $20,000 as the cryptocurrency\u2019s intrinsic value had increased over the last few months due to the growth of new bitcoin wallets, according to him.\nJustifying his increasingly bullish take on the cryptocurrency, Tom Lee stated that he thinks it\u2019s still early for investors to \u201cappreciate how much development and uses cases are being built around bitcoin.\u201d To him, bitcoin\u2019s current volatility is just a \u201cprice discovery process.\u201d\nAddressing those who say bitcoin has no intangible value, Lee said they may be losing some perspective. As a reference, he used the fact that some people said Amazon was worth nothing in the 90s as it wasn\u2019t actually making any money. Taking this into account, the Wall Street strategist said:\n\u201cOn a long-term basis, [the easiest way to look at bitcoin is] as a replacement or a store of value. So as millennials discover and generate income, they\u2019re going to use it as a replacement for gold. If [bitcoin] gets 5 percent of the gold market, that\u2019s roughly $50,000.\u201d\nFollowing his line of thought, Lee sees Bitcoin getting to $20,000 as it keeps gaining on gold\u2019s territory. Over the last year, bitcoin surged over 1,400%, while gold remained at the $1,300 level. Moreover, as reported by CCN, Google search queries for \u201cbuy bitcoin\u201d surpassed those for \u201cbuy gold.\u201d\nLee has in the past stated that bitcoin is a good bet for millennials, after comparing this generation\u2019s acceptance for cryptocurrencies as an investment to that of adopting gold among previous generations.\nWhen asked if he would rather by bitcoin over stocks, Lee stated that \u201ceven on a risk-adjusted basis bitcoin is going to easily outperform the S&P.\u201d On a near-term basis, Lee sees bitcoin reclaim its December all-time high close to the $20,000 mark. If the cryptocurrency can get to that level in the first half of the year, Lee said, he sees it making an even bigger move in the second half of 2018.\nAs such, Lee concluded, bitcoin is \u201csomething you should own [all year].\u201d Lee, who was JP Morgan\u2019s chief equity strategist from 2007 to 2014 before helping launch Fundstrat, had a \u201cconservative\u201d $25,000 bitcoin price target for 2022 that has now seemingly been increased, if bitcoin performs as he expects it to this year.", "category": "Bitcoin in Media"}

An initial coin offering (ICO) is scheduled to open at the end of January.\nWith an official announcement on Tuesday, US-based Eastman Kodak revealed that KODAKCoin will be \u201ca photo-centric cryptocurrency to empower photographers and agencies\u201d to seize greater control of their work\u2019s image rights.\nKODAKCoin will function as a currency and the cryptographic token used to power KODAKOne, an upcoming blockchain platform that will allow photographers to register archived and new work on an encrypted digital ledger before licensing it within the platform. In essence, photographers can receive payments for selling their work, as well as pay for licensing rights with the cryptocurrency.\nAside from providing a new revenue stream to photographers, Kodak says its blockchain platform will engage in \u2018continual web crawling\u2019 to constantly monitor and protect the intellectual property of images registered on the platform.\nIn a statement, Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke said:\n\u201cFor many in the tech industry, \u2018blockchain\u2019 and \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who\u2019ve long struggled to assert control over their work and how it\u2019s used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem. Kodak has always sought to democratize photography and make licensing fair to artists. These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that.\u201d\nThe blockchain platform and the cryptocurrency are developed by WENN Digital, a firm partnering Kodak for the latter\u2019s crypto endeavor.\nThe move to create its own cryptocurrency is a notable initiative for Kodak, a 130-year-old company that struggled to transition from a former photography giant focused on film to a digital imaging company. The New York-based company filed for bankruptcy in early 2012 before selling its digital imaging patents to the likes to a number of companies including Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Samsung for over $500 million to stave off bankruptcy. Kodak has since emerged as a company focused on the corporate digital emerging market.\nIn addition to its cryptocurrency, Kodak will launch an initial coin offering on January 31, currently open to accredited investors in a handful of select countries including the US, UK and Canada. The ICO is compliant and \u201cissued under SEC guidelines as a security token under regulation 506 (c) as an exempt offering,\u201d Kodak added.\nNews of KODAKCoin and KODAKOne\u2019s impending launch sent the company\u2019s shares soaring following its announcement yesterday.

Direxion withdrew its application on Jan. 8, citing the SEC\u2019s concern over the liquidity of the futures markets.\n\u201cOn a call with the Staff on January 5, 2018, the Staff expressed concerns regarding the liquidity and valuation of the underlying instruments in which the Fund intends to primarily invest and requested that the Trust withdraw the Amendment until such time as these concerns are resolved.

VanEck, First Trust Advisors, Exchange Listed Funds Trust (ELF), and ProShares Trust have all filed letters requesting to have their applications withdrawn. None of these firms intended to exercise leverage through their proposed funds, although several sought to offer inverse ETFs, which are designed to return the opposite of the index and are generally considered to be riskier than long ETFs.\nProShares\u2019 withdrawal is notable given that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) had sought to list its bitcoin funds on its Arca trading platform.

Faced with this misfortune, Wang attempted to sue a group of bitcoin exchanges \u2014 the most notable which was Huobi, one of the region\u2019s largest exchanges \u2014 to recoup his losses.\nWang argued that, under the definition laid out in the first chapter of Karl Marx\u2019s Das Kapital, bitcoin should not be classified as a commodity. Marx wrote that a commodity must have both use-value and exchange-value, and Wang argued that since bitcoin does not exist it fails to meet this classification. Consequently, he said, his trades should be invalidated and the exchanges should return his funds.\nHowever, the Beijing Haidian District Court judge ruled that the plaintiff provided no evidence that Huobi and the other exchanges were operating illegally, making him responsible for the risks associated with trading bitcoin.\n\u201c[There are] no laws that forbid the investment and trading of bitcoin,\u201d the court stated, according to a translation from cnLedger, \u201cpeople have the right to freely participate in bitcoin tradings at their own risk.\u201d\nNevertheless, the judge cautioned, bitcoin is not issued by the government and investors should not blindly follow trends.\nThe ruling came just months after central bank regulators ordered the closure of mainland bitcoin exchanges in China as a corollary to its blanket ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs), which was implemented several days prior.\nSome exchanges left the mainland and set up shop elsewhere. Huobi, for instance, is now headquartered in Singapore and plans to branch out into Japan, while BTCC is now based out of London.\nRecently, local media outlets have reported that regulators desire to make China less hospitable to cryptocurrency mining, which continues to have an outsized presence in the country.

Decentralized applications building on top of the Ethereum blockchain protocol have hundreds of thousands of active users and the Ethereum blockchain network is being utilized on a daily basis for payments, decentralized operations, and financial activities.\nAccording to Etherscan, the Ethereum network has been processing more than 1.2 million transactions on a daily basis, more than the transaction volume of all cryptocurrencies in the market combined, including bitcoin.\nIs the Cryptocurrency Market Ready to Rebound?\nWithin a three-day span, the market valuation of the cryptocurrency market fell from nearly $900 billion to $727 billion, experiencing a major correction that affected almost every digital asset in the global market. \nSpecifically, the 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the market such as bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ripple, that struggled to record major gains over the past week, will likely recover in the short-term, given that they have underperformed against smaller digital assets in the space for a relatively long period of time.\nIt is rare for major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to fall by more than 10 percent within a week and not demonstrate early signs of recovery. Given that the daily trading volume of the cryptocurrency market still remains high, and the daily trading volume of bitcoin alone remains above $17 billion, the market could recover in the next few days.\nStill, despite the current state of the market, smaller assets like 0x, Storm, Augur, and NEO have made large daily returns over 10 percent.\nClick here for the current cryptocurrency market-cap.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

The central bank official also admitted fielding a number of public complaints about banks making it difficult to move fiat money from their accounts to purchase cryptocurrencies while adding it would be \u201cdifficult\u201d to issue regulations for cryptocurrencies.\nPointedly, she stated:\n\u201cBitcoin and similar virtual currencies are not a currency, and are not considered foreign currency.

Analysts have stated that the dismissal of miners in China could lead to a bitcoin price surge due to a decrease in supply.\nNo Ban\nAccording to CnLedger, it is unlikely that the Chinese government will outright ban cryptocurrency and bitcoin mining in the short-term, because it is difficult to do so through strict regulations and policies. But, the government has taken the approach of collaborating with local electricity grid operators to provide a more challenging ecosystem for miners. Essentially, the Chinese government is trying to push miners out of the local industry.\nCnLedger reported:\n\u201cCaixin: PBoC did not hold a closed-door meeting, nor are they asking to shut down mining fields before a \u2018deadline.\u2019 However, the regulators are indeed gradually canceling the preferential policies offered previously in electricity fees, taxes and land to some mining facilities.\nYiCai: Regulators are asking local departments to report the current status of bitcoin mining companies under administration, and \u2018guide the mining firms to exit in an orderly manner\u2019 by taking various measures from the aspects of electricity, land, tax, environmental protection.\u201d\nIn an interview with South China Morning Post, one bitcoin miner who requested his name to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, revealed that there exists corruption within the Chinese bitcoin mining sector and that miners have been paying local grid operators to be able to mine cryptocurrencies.\nAs such, since November of 2017, Chinese miners have been exploring other potential regions to relocate and migrate their cryptocurrency mining ventures. While southwest China has become a popular destination for miners because of its cheap electricity, other regions such as Norway and Chile have cheaper electricity with naturally cold climates that are optimal for bitcoin mining centers.\nCCN previously reported, \u201cCui noted that bribery is common in the Chinese mining scene, as electricity providers have absolute control over their decision to restrict power supply to certain businesses that fail to comply with their demands.\u201d\nDecreased Supply\nAlthough analysts have claimed that the decrease in the supply of bitcoin upon the dismissal of bitcoin mining companies by the Chinese government could lead to a price surge, such a situation can only occur in the short-term.\nIf Chinese miners are forced by the government to give up their operations and move elsewhere, miners will simply relocate to better regions with cheaper resources such as Chile and Norway to continue their mining pools. While the short-term supply of bitcoin could become impacted, in the long-term, it will have minimal effect on the supply of bitcoin.\nAlso, the plan of the Chinese government is to try push bitcoin miners out of the local sector in the mid to long-term through stricter regulations and policies.

On the contrary, the market valuation of Ethereum surged from $85 billion to $135 billion, recording yet another 15 percent increase in value today, on January 10.\nThe recent surge in the price of Ethereum can be largely attributed to the sell-off of XRP, which was likely triggered by the market\u2019s concerns over the sudden spike in the market valuation of Ripple. The harsh criticism of Ripple by analysts such as ConsenSys entrepreneur-in-residence Ryan Selkis could also have led to the decline in confidence towards Ripple.\nOn December 29, Selkis noted that the majority of Ripple\u2019s partner banks are not actually utilizing the Ripple network to process billions of dollars on a regular basis. Given that the transaction volume of Ripple and its network of banks can be only two factors that could possibly justify its market cap, the market\u2019s interest in Ripple decreased in the short-term.\nSelkis wrote:\n\u201cPer a source at one of the major banks re XRP: \u2018I know of no banks that are a) using it, or b) would touch it in any way as it is controlled by a SV company and 20% of all XRP in existence were taken by the founders.\nThe product that Ripple are offering to banks is simply a point-to-point messaging tool with some smart cryptography underneath to ensure that transactions are atomic. The liquidity model used is the same as correspondent banking.\u201d\nIn response to the criticism of Selkis and Nathaniel Poppers of The New York Times that banks are not utilizing the Ripple network to settle large volumes of transactions, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse firmly stated that there are several banks regularly using the xRapid platform of Ripple to process payments at a large-scale.\n\u201cOver the last few months I\u2019ve spoken with actual banks and payment providers. They are indeed planning to use xRapid (our XRP liquidity product) in a serious way. This is a sampling of what I heard:\n\nWe ran the costs on our end and see that this is 100 percent more efficient than what we\u2019re doing now.\nThe xRapid pilots all went perfectly.\nThis is much more efficient than our process today.

At the time users noticed the marketplace\u2019s website had gone offline for an abnormally large period of time before the company revealed what had happened.\nLater on, the company\u2019s website came back, and in a letter sent to users the company revealed it would be giving users their money back. According to NiceHash, it will only be possible to restore the funds thanks to a \u201cgroup of international investors.\u201d\nShortly after the attack was public, the company\u2019s CEO Marko Kobal, along with co-founder Sasa Coh, addressed user concerns through a Facebook livestream. In it they stated the company\u2019s success made it a target, and added that someone \u201creally wanted\u201d to bring them down.\nNotably, through LinkedIn, CEO Marko Kobal recently announced his resignation.

Per the company, the exact date of reimbursement will be announced by January 31, 2018, as an interim period is required to ensure legal paperwork is properly processed.\nMoreover, the company revealed balances lower than 0. 0001 BTC will be written off, and that funds deposited after the breach \u201cshould be safe,\u201d and will automatically be sent back. Users using NiceHash Miner were also asked to immediately update their wallet addresses.\nRegarding the ongoing investigation, the company noted that police and a cyber forensic team are working on the case.

He said the dollar, like cryptocurrencies, is not centralized, and many are in use outside of U.S. jurisdiction.\nToday there are more dollars worldwide than gold reserves could guarantee, the cleric said. He compared the dollar to cryptocurrency since no one knows how it is controlled, how its value changes and how many are in circulation.\nHilarion said cryptocurrency must be examined from a moral aspect, and that the church at some future time will have to voice its opinion on cryptocurrency.\nHe said he has not been asked to bless anyone\u2019s cryptocurrency mining operation and declined to say if he would agree to such a request.\nAlso read: How churches are starting to evangelize about bitcoin\nReligious Opinions Vary\nNot all Christian clergy agree with Hilarion.\nThe Christian-oriented media Church Law & Tax recently addressed the debate following the publication of an article welcoming the decision of the American charity United Way Worldwide to accept bitcoin for its Innovation Fund.\nThe article in Christianity Today reported an online guide explaining how churches can accept bitcoin.\nBy accepting bitcoin payments, churches can make it easy for those that want to give anonymously, the article noted.\nOne parishioner convinced\u00a0the vicar of St Martin\u2019s Church in Kentish Town in the United Kingdom to accept bitcoin.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

If you use subjective judgment, you could misjudge or overlook something,\u201d said Horsley.\nRealistically, unless investors devote themselves full-time in cryptocurrency investment and researching emerging technologies in the market, it is challenging to develop a depth of knowledge in many cryptocurrencies. For instance, despite the $20 billion market valuation of Cardano, many investors are still unaware of the cryptocurrency and new to its technology.\nHence, focusing on the 10 largest cryptocurrencies in the market would encourage and motivate investors to invest in cryptocurrencies with a depth of knowledge sufficient to justify their investments and be confident in the technologies they support.\nHealthy Portfolio\nPrior to the fundraiser initiated by the bitcoin community in which investors in the space raised over $2 million for bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos, it was revealed that Antonopoulos had a small portfolio of diversified assets. During a talk, Antonopoulos shared his personal investment strategy:\n\u201cI own a few different crypto assets as part of a small but diversified portfolio. I only risk as much as I\u2019m willing to lose.\u201d\nWhile many investors in the cryptocurrency market still own 100 percent of their funds in bitcoin, a diversification of assets can significantly reduce risks involved, as high performing cryptocurrencies can cover the losses of assets performing sub par. \nMoreover, in a separate talk, Antonopoulos noted that investors should only invest a certain amount of money in cryptocurrencies that is proportional to their understanding of the technology. Investing a large sum of money in a cryptocurrency like bitcoin and Ethereum without a\u00a0proper understanding of the technologies that support the two cryptocurrencies would be reckless and financially irresponsible.\n\u201cWhat percentage of your wealth should be tied up in bitcoin? A percentage that is equivalent to your understanding of how the technology works and your ability to absorb the risks it entails, which for most people is a small percentage,\u201d said Antonopoulos.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

The bank began researching cryptocurrencies in 2015 and was considering launching its own cryptocurrency.\nThe bank continues to research cryptocurrencies, but it has decided that having its own such currency could have negative ramifications on traditional banks. The bank believes that consumers would choose its cryptocurrency over paper money and would stop using commercial bank accounts as well as paper money.\nConcern About Impact On Banks\nThe central bank feared consumers would withdraw funds from commercial banks and those banks would not have the funds to pay their depositors, bringing havoc to the economy. The banks would also not be able to borrow from other banks.\nThe central bank is also concerned that it would not be able to maintain financial stability using its interest rate policy.\nThe demand for traditional paper money is fairly elastic, meaning it responds through price changes to interest rates charged on the money. The bank said it is not sure if such elasticity would sustain itself in a cryptocurrency economy, undermining the bank\u2019s ability maintain economic stability using interest rates.\nInterest Rate As A Tool\nShould the central bank believe there is too much debt in the economy, it can raise interest rates to reduce the demand for borrowing, thereby motivating people to save money. This would theoretically halt a debt bubble that would eventually burst.\nShould the central bank believe there is insufficient demand in the economy, cutting interest rates would make debt cheaper, motivating people to borrow more and save less, thereby building aggregate demand in the economy.

Cryptocurrencies which had recorded massive gains in the past week such as Tron, Ripple, and Cardano have struggled to recover from their previous corrections, while bitcoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash have risen by more than 10 percent over the past two days.\nLitecoin in particular, which fell behind Stellar as the ninth largest cryptocurrency at a certain point this week, recorded a swift recovery, demonstrating a 20 percent increase in value and obtaining a $16 billion market cap. Although Litecoin still remains significantly lower than Cardano, it had made a major upward movement for the first time over the past week.\n\nThe rise of bitcoin, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash has shown that the extremely risky and volatile cryptocurrency market considers cryptocurrencies that have existed in the market for the longest period of time as reserve assets or currencies. Bitcoin in particular has become the safe bet within the global market.\nOver the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market has a seen a trend in which investors in alternative cryptocurrencies have cashed out their returns from their ultra high profit trades to bitcoin, to secure their profits. Consequently, the price of bitcoin surpassed $17,000, briefly achieving $27,000 in the South Korean market.\n\nBitcoin is acknowledged as a safe haven asset and reserve currency within the global cryptocurrency market because of its market valuation and the infrastructure around its network. Some of the largest financial institutions and banks such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and CME Group have increased the liquidity of the cryptocurrency, opening the market for institutional investors and retail traders.\nBecause of its strong network effect and existing infrastructure, bitcoin remains more stable and less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, and tend to move relatively slow in comparison to other cryptocurrencies in the market.\nThe launch of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Cboe with the approval of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), will further increase in the liquidity of bitcoin and enable it to solidify itself as a major asset class, further increasing its value and accessibility to the traditional finance sector.\nLitecoin\u2019s 20% Gain\nLitecoin was briefly overtaken by Tron, a blockchain-based entertainment platform with more than 300,000 active users in terms of market valuation.\nAt the time, Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin and former Coinbase executive, reaffirmed that he was not concerned with the short-term price trend of Litecoin, because other indicators showed that Litecoin was a more active blockchain network than its competition. Lee said:\n\u201cFor those asking, I care very little about market cap rank. I care more about the chart on the left (# transactions) than the chart on the right (price). The Litecoin team and I are focused on the chart on the left. People need to actually use Litecoin. The price will follow.\nAs you can see, Litecoin is doing very well in terms of growth in usage.

McAfee began the practice in December of 2017, and he quickly became an investing mouthpiece that perked the ears of many community members. \u00a0\nAccording to McAfee, though, the same platform that has made him a fount for financial advice has also made him vulnerable to hackers looking to make a quick buck.\nOn December 27th, McAfee\u2019s account was compromised as hackers rifled off multiple coin of the day tweets in a matter of minutes:\n\n\u00a0\nMcAfee was quick to alert his followers to the developments, cautioning them that he had discontinued his quotidian promotions the day prior:\n\nUrgent: My account was hacked. Twitter has been notified. The coin of the day tweet was not me. As you all know\u2026 I am not doing a coin of the day anymore!!!!\n\u2014 John McAfee (@officialmcafee) December 27, 2017\n\n\nThough I am a security expert, I have no control over Twitter's security.

Adults only please.\n\u2014 John McAfee (@officialmcafee) December 28, 2017\n\nIn an interview with RT, McAfee admitted that the hacking method was \u201cbrand new\u201d to him, claiming the hackers \u201cmanaged to hack AT&T to move [his] phone number to another phone\u201d so that they could change his account\u2019s password. \u00a0He also insinuated that, unless the job was some \u201csecret method of hacking,\u201d an AT&T employee could have been \u201cbribed\u201d to assist with the hit.\nMcAfee continued to claim resolutely that the hackers were looking to capitalize on the investing community he has cultivated through Twitter: \n\u201cWhy would they do that? Because I was issuing every day a recommendation for new alternative coins, alternative to bitcoins cryptocurrencies. People would invest hundreds of dollars into these coins. What the hacker did was to recommended six different coins within six minutes and invested, I\u2019m sure, much money beforehand into those\u201d \n\u201cIf they can do it for me they can do it for anyone,\u201d he added, concluding the interview with the caveat that such advanced hacking methods could spell trouble for exchanges in the future. \u00a0Citing Mt. Gox as an example of exchange vulnerability, McAfee predicted that \u201cevery exchange will at some point in the near future get hacked.\u201d\nThe Verge Effect\nWhile all of this was going on, McAfee was (and is) staring down the barrel of another controversy: his endorsement of Verge.\nOn December 13th 2017, John McAfee came out in favor of the popular privacy coin, tweeting the following day that Verge, trading for nearly $0.02 at the time, could feasibly see a $3.00 valuation in the future.\n\nI am inundated by people asking me for recommendations on cryptocurrencies. If you would use your heads you would figure out that the privacy coins (anonymous transactions) will have the greatest future. Coins like Monero (XMR), Verge (XVG), or Zcash (ZEC) cannot lose.\n\u2014 John McAfee (@officialmcafee) December 13, 2017\n\nTrading at less than a cent going into December, Verge hit an all time high of $0.27 on Christmas Eve. Many believe that Verge has McAfee\u2019s tweets and endorsements to thank for this meteoric appreciation.\nAnd it\u2019s easy to see why some in the community think as much.\u00a0 Around Christmas, rumors began circulating\u00a0of McAfee speculating\u00a0 on Instagram that Verge could hit an astronomical $15 in 2018. \u00a0\n\nJohn McAfee on #Verge (XVG) in his instagram: \"$15 by June 2018 don't miss it. You can not lose with Verge.\" $XVG #XVG #Vergecurrency #cryptocurrency #privacycoin pic.twitter.com/qnnmxDhAX9\n\u2014 CryptoSub (@CryptoSubs) December 25, 2017\n\nSuch a price leap would put Verge at a $225bln market capitalization, about $30bln shy of Bitcoin\u2019s own. While possible, such a terrific rise is unlikely, and McAfee went to Twitter to deny that he ever made the predication.\n\nTo the Verge people: I stated that VERGE MIGHT possibly rise, over the long term, to $0.15 \u2013 which was an increase of 1,500% over its price st the time. If you believe I am so stupid as to predict a rise of 150,000% \u2013 which is $15 \u2013 then you need to back off on the drugs.\n\u2014 John McAfee (@officialmcafee) December 27, 2017\n\nMcAfee claims that the predictions came from fraudulent accounts, warning his followers that Verge\u2019s price has been artificially pumped as a result. \u00a0He disavows ever setting up an official Instagram account, but community members are not convinced. \u00a0In the comment sections of numerous tweets, Twitter users provided evidence that John McAfee created an Instagram for himself back in the early days of 2016. \u00a0\n\nI finally have an instagram account;https://t.co/NmXIdm5OcA\n\u2014 John McAfee (@officialmcafee) January 31, 2016\n\nDefending himself, McAfee raised the familiar alarm that this was the outcome of yet another attack on his Twitter account: \n\u201cIn early 2016 my Twitter account was taken over for nearly a month by an employee in a hostile move. There were thousands of acts of mischief during that time. When was the last alleged post from me on that Instagram account?\u201d\nSince facing questions from the community about the veracity of his Instagram posts, the posts in question have been deleted.\nVerge\u2019s Wraith Protocol Launches to Little Fanfare\nVerge launched its Wraith Protocol, an update that allows the currency\u2019s users to choose between transparent or anonymous transactions freely, on January 1st. \u00a0And to add to the slew of Twitter publicity mishaps a la McAfee, Verge\u2019s fan-base was unimpressed. \u00a0\nThe protocol was slow to launch and buggy for certain users, according to Verge\u2019s official Twitter. \u00a0In addition, one Twitter user indicated that Wraith\u2019s IP obfuscation was not functioning as intended.\nVerge\u2019s price dropped from its rise of $0.20 in anticipation of the release to $0.14 after the complications.\nAll the while, McAfee enters the cross hairs of continued controversy.\u00a0 Now, he faces accusation of blackmailing the Verge team,\u00a0demanding compensation for his endorsements.\u00a0 According to leaked messages in a tweet by XVG Whale, a popular Verge investor, McAfee demanded $1mln in Ethereum for his promotions, otherwise he would withdraw his support.\u00a0 In the following days, XVG Whale has removed the posts, claiming that his own account was hacked, as well.\nBetween the host of alleged hacks, accusations, and online rumors, John McAfee\u2019s involvement in Verge has woven itself into a messy thread of information and misinformation all knotted into one.\u00a0 We cannot verify the claims of extortion and fraud, nor do we know what to make of the counterclaims by McAfee and XVG Whale that hackers are the reason for this mess.\nBut the drama makes for an interesting showcase nonetheless.", "category": "News"}

Fund providers and exchanges are currently racing to list the first bitcoin exchange-traded funds (Bitcoin ETFs).\nStockman, however, said that bitcoin derivatives do not lend cryptocurrency any legitimacy but rather provide Wall Street firms with another opportunity to take advantage of ordinary investors who are captivated by the bitcoin price\u2019s rapid appreciation.\n\u201cAnytime Wall Street sees an opportunity to shear the sheep, and when they see the sheep stampeding to the slaughter, they line up with some new gimmick to take advantage of the circumstance,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing that is being validated by the opening up of a futures market.\nRegulation Not Necessary\nDespite these pointed cryptocurrencies, Stockman did not add his name to the growing list of regulatory officials in countries around the globe who believe governments should regulate bitcoin or even subject it to an outright ban (a suggestion, one might add, that reveals an ignorance about the technology behind cryptocurrency.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think regulators should do anything about it at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take care of itself.\nWrite to Josiah Wilmoth at josiah.wilmoth(at)cryptocoinsnews.com.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

It also has secured a strategic partnership with SBI Group, one of Japan\u2019s largest financial institutions, to launch a large-scale cryptocurrency trading platform in Japan and South Korea.\n\u201cSBI Holdings has reached a basic agreement with Huobi Group (1.65 million accounts, maximum daily transaction volume of over CNY 30 billion (approximately JPY 510 billion), which has a track record of stably operating a major cryptocurrency exchange in China, to explore the following alliances,\u201d the official statement released by SBI Holdings on December 7 read.\nThe official partnership document further revealed that SBI Group had acquired 30 percent of equity in Huobi\u2019s Japanese venture Huobi Technology Japan Co., Ltd.\n\u201cSBI Group\u2019s acquisition of 30% of equity in Huobi Group\u2019s Japanese entity (Huobi Technology Japan Co., Ltd.) and 10% of equity in Huobi Group\u2019s Korean entity (HUOBI CO., Ltd). Huobi Group\u2019s acquisition of 30% of equity in SBI Virtual Currencies, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings.\u201d\nThe partnership between SBI Holdings and Huobi is particularly noteworthy, as that would prevent any potential conflict between the traders on the Huobi platform and Japanese banks. SBI Holdings is expected to provide the Huobi trading platform with virtual bank accounts and robust banking infrastructure.\nThe backing of a major financial institution will also significantly help Huobi penetrate into the South Korean cryptocurrency market, given that Japanese and South Korean banks are already collaborating on several cryptocurrency-related projects.\nMajor Markets in the Making\nAccording to CryptoCompare, the Japanese and South Korean cryptocurrency markets account for 40 percent of global bitcoin trades and 10 percent of global Ethereum trades. Cryptocurrency exchanges in the two regions have millions of active traders, despite the implementation of strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems that render the user verification process extremely inconvenient and inefficient.\nThe entrance of major cryptocurrency exchanges like Huobi will better structure the Japanese and South Korean cryptocurrency exchange markets that are dominated by a handful of exchanges. \nMore importantly, when China accounted for the majority of bitcoin trades in 2016, Huobi processed more trading volumes on a daily basis than any other trading platform in the global market. As such, Huobi will likely be able to provide a trading platform that can address the demand for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies from high profile traders and institutional investors.\nCCN previously reported that bitcoin has begun to boost the GDP of the Japanese economy, as\u00a0Nomura economists Yoshiyuki Simon and Kazuki Miyamoto explained:\n\u201cWe estimate the wealth effect from unrealized gains on bitcoin trading by Japanese investors since the start of fiscal year 2017, and estimate a potential boost to consumer spending of 23.2-96.0 billion yen.\u201d\nThe emergence of large-scale cryptocurrency exchanges will lead to an exponential growth rate of local cryptocurrency markets in both Japan and South Korea.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

Just last year, the bank announced it had commissioned a theoretical currency, RS Coin, which could be used by central banks to settle payments.\nNow, England\u2019s central bank is upping the ante, looking to make its theoretical concept into a viable reality.\nA research team vetted by the Bank has been studying the possibility of a central bank-issued cryptocurrency since 2015. \u00a0In order to avert the volatility that has come to define Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency would be backed by the Bank of England and tethered to the pound sterling, Great Britain\u2019s national currency. The Bank anticipates the research unit to report back sometime in 2018 with their findings.\nBefore the Christmas holiday, Dr. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, made the case for a central bank-backed cryptocurrency to England\u2019s Treasury Select Committee. \u00a0Defending the idea, he stated that \u201cThe underlying technology is actually of a fair bit of interest. We are working with it at the Bank of England.\u201d\n\u201cI have participated in discussions with the major central banks on this issue,\u201d he continued, saying that such talks would resume in the new year. \u00a0He also revealed that, over the summer, the Bank successfully transacted with another central bank using blockchain technology.\nAccording to Dr. Carney, there are clear positives to using blockchain technology for central banking practices. \u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t end up with those financial stability risks; you get financial stability benefits. And you save huge amounts of computational energy intensity,\u201d he argued.\nThe Governor also added that the Bank and its research unit are \u201cdisciplined\u201d in their approach. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to apply something to the core of the system, it\u2019s going to need to meet five sigma quality rating.\u201d\nIf the trials are successful enough for actual adoption, a cryptocurrency banking option could pave the way for near instantaneous payments for cars, land, houses, and other key assets.\nStill, Dr. Carney was careful to address the limitations of a central bank-backed cryptocurrency. \u00a0One such weak point, he believes, is solvency if the currency were introduced on a widespread, public scale. \nSuch adoption may \u201ccreate a situation where you can have an instantaneous [bank] run.\u201d \u00a0Further, if users were to deposit all of their cryptocurrency into the Bank of England, it would need to reconcile the best way to diversify its investments with these assets. \u00a0\u201cSo there are some fundamental problems if you push the retail design all the way down, unless you restrict the amount that people have.\u201d\nEngland Joins the Queue for State Sponsored Crypto \nThis revelation makes England the latest in an expanding list of countries that have either entertained or approved their own cryptocurrencies.\nRecently, Israel announced its own plans for the digital shekel, the Israeli central bank\u2019s solution to combating black market purchases that comprise just over 20% of Israel\u2019s GDP. \nBack in October, Vladimir Putin put Russia on the map as the first country to announce official plans for its own state-issued cryptocurrency, the digital ruble.\u00a0 Apparently, Russia is entertaining the cryptoruble as a means to circumvent international sanctions.\u00a0\u00a0Venezuela has announced their own cryptocurrency in a similar attempt to mitigate the impact of sanctions from the United States.\u00a0 Some months ago, President Nicolas Maduro unveiled the petro, a national cryptocurrency backed by Venezuelan oil reserves.\nAs England moves forward with its own plans, they will likely face criticism from the cryptocurrency community for introducing centralization to what was intended as a decentralized payment option. Industry leader Vitalki Buterin already expressed doubts earlier this year of central banks creating their\u00a0 cryptocurrencies. \u00a0If the sterling-pegged currency is specific to the Bank of England, expect retail banks to raise cane, as well, as the move will likely threaten their costumer share of England\u2019s banking populace.", "category": "Banking"}

One address has been identified as belonging to cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, while the other address owners are unknown but may belong to other exchanges, custodial services, or hedge funds.\nSource: BitInfoCharts\nHowever, most bitcoin users spread their holdings across multiple addresses, and many newer bitcoin wallets automatically generate new addresses every time the user selects \u201creceive\u201d in the client. Wallet explorers can link together addresses belonging to the same wallet, but careful users can keep their funds in several wallets that do not interact with one another, concealing the fact that they share an owner.\nIt has been well-publicized that bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto most likely owned addresses containing nearly 1 million BTC, worth more than $13 billion at current exchange rates.

The 60,000% rise helped Ripple become the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, and is now valued at over $140 billion.\nBehind the XRP token is San Francisco-based company Ripple, which uses blockchain technology in financial transactions. According to Forbes, its co-founder and former CEO Chris Larsen, owns 5.19 billion XRP tokens, currently worth over $16.9 billion. He reportedly also owns 17% of the company, bringing his total net worth to $44.16 billion at current rates.\nThis makes Larsen the 18th richest person in the world, behind Indian business magnate Mush Ambani, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaire Index. Back in November 2016, the 57-year-old stepped down as CEO of Ripple, turning the reigns over to Brad Garlinghouse, the company\u2019s current CEO.\nCiting a source at the company, Forbes claims Garlinghouse owns 6.3% of Ripple, and additional XRP tokens.

This, despite various holders having a large number of bitcoins, including Satoshi Nakamoto, the cryptocurrency\u2019s creator, who\u2019s believed to have 980,000 Bitcoins, equal to roughly 5.8% of all currently existing bitcoins.\nGranted, Ripple has unveiled a strategy that, per its technology chief Stefan Thomas, will make the Ripple Consensus Ledger (RCL), Ripple\u2019s blockchain, more secure, efficient and decentralized than bitcoin. The strategy will include three fundamental steps. First, Ripple will grow and diversity the validator nodes on its blockchain, to avoid the risk of a single point of failure. Then, it will recruit attested validators and monitor them, so it can then add them to its Unique Node Lists (UNLs).

So much so, that according to Thomas Bertani, the CEO of Swiss-based Eidoo, developers can demand as much as $10,000 to $15,000 a month in the country, amounting to $120,000 and $180,000 a year, reports the Business Insider.\nBertani said:\nThe reasons are: 1) highly skilled blockchain-experienced devs are very hard to find; and 2) Switzerland is well known to be one of the most expensive countries on earth.\nNot only that, but Switzerland is greatly considered as one of the most forward thinking countries for digital currency and blockchain development. The Swiss nation is also quickly becoming a hotspot for companies that are keen to perform initial coin offerings (ICOs), which are banned in China and warned against in the U.S. and the U.K.\nDespite this, though, Switzerland considers ICOs as a new type of investment, with many embracing it to raise funds for their various ventures. According to the Crypto Valley Association, with its headquarters in Zug, which is known as the country\u2019s \u2018Crypto Valley,\u2019 it lists more than 100 members \u2013 individuals and organisations \u2013 that have set up their operations in the Swiss country.\nHowever, according to Bertani, it\u2019s \u2018almost impossible\u2019 to find good distributed ledger developers due to the fact that ICO companies with enough cash to splash tend to attract the developers with higher paid salaries.\nIn February, it was reported that Switzerland was going one step further to make itself even more attractive to potential businesses.

It is the product of years of work and it builds on the recommendations included in a bipartisan report titled \u2018The Buck Stops Here: Improving United States Anti-Money Laundering Practice.\u2019\nThe hearing, which heard from seven witnesses over two panels, focused on the threat that money laundering, terrorist financing, and other forms of illicit financing pose to the national security of the U.S. and the integrity of the U.S. and international financial systems.\nKenneth Blanco, deputy attorney general of the criminal division at the U.S. Department of Justice, said that as economies and financial systems become increasingly global, so too do criminal organisations.\nHe said:\nTransnational criminal organizations, kleptocrats, cybercriminal groups, terrorists, drug cartels, and alien smugglers alike must find ways to disguise the origins of the proceeds of their crimes so that they can use the profits without jeopardizing their source.\nAccording to the UN\u00a0Office on Drugs and Crime, it estimates\u00a0that annual illicit proceeds total more than $2 trillion globally. Some of the money laundering threats that Blanco highlights include illicit cash, trade-based money laundering, illicit use of banks, prepaid access cards, and digital currencies.\nThe use of cryptocurrencies enables criminals to conduct illicit transactions because they offer potential anonymity, which enables them to move their criminal proceeds between countries, states Blanco. In his opinion, though, some countries have limited AML controls.\nAs an example, he cites\u00a0the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s (DEA) 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment, which found that\u00a0China-based firms manufacturing goods used in trade-based money laundering schemes often prefer to accept payment in bitcoin because it can be used to anonymously transfer value overseas, thereby circumventing China\u2019s capital controls. However, many would argue that bitcoin is in fact pseudo-anonymous.\nMatthew Allen, acting assistant director of the Homeland Security Investigative Programs and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, explained that in November 2016 HSI special agents\u00a0investigated and seized $1.2 million in cash from Utah resident Aaron Shamo, who led a Xanax and fentanyl pill production organization. He then proceeded to sell his illicit products via the dark web where an investigation led to the identity of his digital currency wallet address. According to Allen, agents were able to seize Shamo\u2019s bitcoins, valued at $2.5 million.\nYet, despite this,\u00a0Jennifer Fowler, deputy assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes at the\u00a0U.S. Department of the Treasury, claims that the U.S. dollar continues to remain a popular currency for illicit commerce and money laundering. She adds, though, that the Treasury is continually monitoring the use and development of new payment technologies, such as digital currencies.\nShe said:\nAlthough virtual currencies are used for illicit transactions, the volume is small compared to the volume of illicit activity through traditional financial services.", "category": "Bitcoin Law"}

The cryptocurrency surged from under $1,000 to over $19,000 last year, before it plunged back to $13,000. It has since recovered and is currently trading at $14,599, according to CCN\u2019s price index. Taking into account its volatile price and astounding growth, the People\u2019s Daily asserts it\u2019s a fact bitcoin is a bubble\n\u201cIrrespective of whether it is assessed on price or value, bitcoin is flooded with froth,\u201d it reads (rough translation). \u201cIts so-called advantages \u2013 scarcity, authenticity, strong liquidity, transparency and decentralization \u2013 are only covers for speculation and cannot support its volatile price.\u201d\nPer the piece, bitcoin\u2019s bubble was created by a combination of speculation, hype, mystery, and decentralization. The piece\u2019s author, Wei Liang, even hints at possible insider trading, suggesting bitcoiners with a large amount of bitcoin manipulated investors to fuel speculation and further drive the cryptocurrency\u2019s price up.\nIt adds that bitcoin isn\u2019t recognized as a currency throughout the world, and that financial regulators \u201cnaturally do not regulate bitcoin as much as they do other currencies,\u201d leaving the cryptocurrency in a \u201cspecial gray area,\u201d and uses bitcoin futures on regulated exchanges as an example of how the cryptocurrency is being protected.\nThe People\u2019s Daily then compares the cryptocurrency to the Dutch tulip bulb bubble, implying bitcoin\u2019s bubble will burst once governments around the world start regulating it. As such, caution is advised as bitcoin\u2019s price has in the past seen sharp falls and its \u201cfuture direction is particularly alarming.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first-time Chinese officials express their aversion to bitcoin. Last month, as reported by CCN, a People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) official stated he thinks bitcoin will end up floating down a river, as a dead body.\nThe piece comes at a time in which it\u2019s been revealed Chinese authorities won\u2019t \u2018ban\u2019 bitcoin miners, but will remove their preferential treatment in local provinces. This means preferential policies in electricity consumption, land use, and tax cuts may soon be gone for Chinese bitcoin miners.\nLast year, China\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, enforced a blanket ban on all initial coin offerings (ICOs), a day after the Leading Group of Beijing Internet Financial Risks Remediation mandated the shuttering of cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. Since then, investors reportedly started using unregulated peer-to-peer exchanges. According to the South China Morning Post, the number of peer-to-peer exchanges in the country surged from four in October to 21 by the end of November.\nInterestingly, bitcoin\u2019s price seems to be mostly unaffected by China\u2019s recent moves. When news of the crackdown first came out, the cryptocurrency\u2019s price crashed. As reported, a \u2018crackdown\u2019 on bitcoin mining could be beneficial for the wider ecosystem, as it could decentralize the majority of the mining hashrate.\n\u00a0", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

Another billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, who has been an active advocate of bitcoin, boldly claimed that the price of bitcoin could drop to $8,000 and cancelled his plans to launch a cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund as a result.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t like market conditions and we wanted to re-evaluate what we\u2019re doing. \u201cI look pretty smart pressing the pause button right now. I didn\u2019t want to have to deal with the schizophrenic emotional side of it. There are just so many conflicts in that business. It was going to be more complicated than I wanted,\u201d Novogratz told Bloomberg on December 23.\nTwo weeks ago, the price of bitcoin had declined to $11,500, as the entire cryptocurrency market suffered a major correction that led the market valuation of all cryptocurrencies in the market to fall to $450 billion. At the time of reporting, the market valuation of cryptocurrencies remain near to the $800 billion mark, and has nearly doubled since December 23.\nHence, Novogratz\u2019s concern in regard to the short-term performance of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the market was a nonissue, as the market has fully recovered over the past few weeks.\nDespite the worrying behaviour of long-time investors like Novogratz, Thiel stated that he is personally optimistic in bitcoin because it is providing financial services to the unbanked, which PayPal, one of the largest payments in the global market, was supposed to offer. He added that if bitcoin can evolve into a robust and premier store of value, it has potential.\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m skeptical of most of them, I do think people are a little bit underestimating bitcoin, specifically, because it is like a reserve form of money. If bitcoin ends up being the cyber equivalent of gold, it has great potential,\u201d Thiel said.\nThiel Optimistic on Bitcoin as Store of Value\nRealistically, if bitcoin can continue to scale and grow as a digital currency and store of value, it will be able to penetrate into the $8 trillion gold market and the $40 trillion offshore banking industry. The global offshore banking industry is arguably the largest market any cryptocurrency market can target, and penetrating into that market could provide more potential to a cryptocurrency than becoming a reserve currency of the global economy. \nMore importantly, the flow of billions of dollars from institutional investors and retail traders like Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund will allow the price of bitcoin to surge further, allowing its market valuation to achieve the trillion mark in the upcoming months. Many investors have already predicted the market valuation of bitcoin to reach $1 trillion by the end of 2018, and the Founders Fund has placed a hundred million dollar bet on it.\n\u201cThe representatives have told firm backers that a cascade of cash into technology companies has stretched their valuations to historic highs, making stakes in startups as dangerous a risk as ever. Bitcoin, on the other hand, could multiply several times over in the coming years,\u201d the WSJ report read.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

Citing a source at Ripple, Forbes reports that Larsen personally owns 5.19 billion XRP and has a 17 percent stake in the company, which is currently holding 55 billion XRP in escrow.\nBased on the value of these holdings, Larsen is worth at least $55.8 billion, an estimate that excludes Ripple\u2019s value as a company apart from its XRP balance.\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires Index, this makes Larsen the eighth-wealthiest person in the world, ranking him just ahead of Google co-founder Larry Page and a few billion dollars behind Mexican business magnate Carlos Slim, who formerly held the title of the world\u2019s richest person.\nSource: Bloomberg\nAmazingly, however, Larsen is only one of at least three current or former Ripple executives who have become billionaires due to the cryptocurrency\u2019s recent success.\nJed McCaleb, who co-founded Ripple with Larsen but left the company in 2013 and later founded Stellar, reportedly owns the rights to 5.3 billion XRP \u2014 worth more than $20.3 billion, which are held in escrow by the company and distributed to him on a monthly basis.

If applicable, exchanges could pay over $1 billion in taxes.\nAccording to Indian business daily Economic Times, seven of India\u2019s leading bitcoin exchanges are planning to approach the Advance Authority of Ruling (AAR) \u2013 a judicial body tasked to provide clarity on taxation queries for companies and associations in India. Specifically, the exchanges are looking to ascertain if they are required to pay goods and services tax following India\u2019s biggest taxation revamp in 2017 which sees a singular indirect tax levied on all goods and services for the entire country.\nIt\u2019s unlikely that India\u2019s exchanges are getting any answers soon as authorities struggle to reveal any clear guidelines in either regulation or taxation of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in the country.\nThe report cites a source with direct knowledge of the exchanges\u2019 approach to the AAR as stating:\n\u201cAt least one Bitcoin exchange has filed an application with the [west Indian state] Maharashtra AAR for future tax liability. The tax department is currently researching the concept as Bitcoins are a very complex subject.\u201d\nIf bitcoin is deemed a currency \u2013 this is highly unlikely \u2013 bitcoin exchanges will not be liable to pay any taxes. If bitcoin is classified a good, exchanges will see an 18% tax slab under the new GST regime. Seen as a service, bitcoin exchanges will be liable to pay 12% in taxes.\nThe proactive effort by exchanges come within a month of Indian tax authorities visiting multiple exchanges across the country to \u2018survey\u2019 information and records of bitcoin adopters and traders in India. India\u2019s official taxation authority is reportedly set to issue notices to 500,000 \u2018high net-worth individuals\u2019, reminding them to pay capital gains taxes on their bitcoin investments and trade.\nMeanwhile, Indian exchanges are still trying to determine if GST is applicable on their margins earned or their total revenue.\n\u201cThe combined revenue of top seven players would be around \u20b940,000 crore (approx. $6.3 billion] and they operate at about 20% margins,\u201c revealed one tax official after reviewing exchanges\u2019 balance sheets last month.

Following that tweet, Creighton posted an entire manifesto one week later on the Zclassic Subreddit, detailing his plan for a new Bitcoin fork called \u201cBitcoin Private.\u201d\nThe fork would create a derivative of Bitcoin that utilizes the same privacy protocols as Zclassic, which would enable users to send shielded transactions that hide transacting individuals and values.\nZclassic \u2013 Zcash Minus the Founder\u2019s Share\nZclassic originally forked from Zcash to eliminate the 20% founders reward that Zcash put in place for the first four years. Although Zcash is limited to 21 million coins, a percentage is allocated to founders, investors, employees, and advisors to the company. The founders\u2019 reward allocation will eventually be dropped in 2020 due to it being limited to the first set block reward, however, this still accounts for 10% of the entire supply.\nThis move was similar to the Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash splits, in which the original codebase was forked due to an ideological difference. It contains the same nuts and bolts as the original blockchain, with a few tweaked parameters.\nPrice Gains\nSince news of the fork grew in mid-December, Zclassic has seen significant price movement from a recent low in December of $1.64, to an all-time high of over $123.00 within a span of just over two weeks.\n\nMany are attributing the price action to individuals who wish to capitalize on the derivative produced from the fork without having to pay the exorbitant price for Bitcoin. Investors may see Zclassic as an easier way of obtaining more of the forked cryptocurrency at a cheaper rate, considering that Zclassic is currently trading at a fraction of the price of Bitcoin.\nFork-Support\nThe popularity of recent Bitcoin forks have had both exchanges and wallets in a frenzy due to user requests for support. After Bitcoin Cash forked in August, and Bitcoin Gold forked in October, derivative attempts have been commonplace with December hosting at least five of them.\nSome have even likened the strategy to an initial coin offering by calling the process an \u201cinitial fork offering\u201d due to the increase in frequency.\nCurrently, the only known way to receive this new form of Bitcoin derivative is by storing Zclassic in the project\u2019s official wallet.\nNo exchange has signaled support for the fork at the current moment, but this might change as the date of the actual split approaches. Many exchanges recently have been \u2018fork-friendly,\u2019 with Binance and Kucoin supporting multiple forms of the recent Bitcoin derivatives. Although Zclassic isn\u2019t currently supported on these mentioned exchanges, Bitcoin holder demands might lead to full-fledged support if the project is deemed legitimate enough by internal standards.\nThe fork is expected to occur towards the end of January, and Zclassic and Bitcoin holders will be granted Bitcoin Private on a one to one basis. The supply is expected to be 18.5 million coins (capped at 21 million), resulting from the combined supply of Bitcoin and Zclassic.\n\u00a0Disclaimer: The author of this article currently holds Zclassic.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

At the time, reports emerged that regulators would move against bitcoin mining next, but the ban never materialized, and miners continued to operate normally over the ensuing months.\nWhile the substance of this report should not be classified as a ban, it does indicate that miners will be forced to limit their power usage, and, by extension, the size of their operations. Mainland China is home to approximately two-thirds of the bitcoin hashrate, largely due to the widespread availability of surplus electricity and cheap labor.\nSource: BitInfoCharts\nConsequently, the action could lead to a serious shift in the geographic concentration of bitcoin hashpower, depending both on how quickly and to what degree local governments begin limiting miners\u2019 power consumption.\nReduced Chinese Mining Could Decentralize the Hashrate\nHowever, far from threatening bitcoin, many industry observers believe that a crackdown on Chinese bitcoin mining could benefit the ecosystem in the mid-term, as it will lead to greater decentralization of the mining industry \u2014 just as the bitcoin exchange ban did for cryptocurrency trading volume.\nIn fact, by foregoing an outright ban in favor of a \u201cgradual\u201d reduction in power usage, the government is likely doing the industry a significant favor, as it will give miners located outside of China ample time to scale up their operations to compensate for the reduced hashrate coming out of China, making it less likely that the network will encounter a serious disruption.", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

Subsidy amounts of $50,000 to $1 million will be available, with possibly more for successful projects.\nButerin noted two main paths to improving blockchain scalability: the sharding method and the \u201clayer 2\u201d method.\nThe sharding method creates better-designed base layer protocols that sustain the decentralization and security properties of blockchain, but only requires a small portion of nodes to process each transaction, permitting more simultaneous transactions.\nThe \u201clayer 2\u201d method sends most transactions off chain to only interact with the underlying blockchain to enter and exit from the layer 2 system.\u00a0Examples of layer 2 systems include plasma, state channels and Raiden.\nCombining Both Methods\nButerin sees the two methods as complementary. He supports a multi-pronged strategy for Ethereum scalability that engages both methods.\nAs Ethereum\u2019s blockchain approaches 1 million daily transactions, it nears its full transaction capacity, giving greater urgency for a scaling solution.\nIn addition to the internal tasks involved in addressing scalability, Ethereum is launching two experimental study schemes to empower more independent teams to cooperate with the Ethereum team\u2019s base layer scalability work and create independent layer 2 projects.\nIndependent teams of companies and developers are encouraged to apply for the grants.\nSharding Work Accelerates\nSharding development has accelerated over the last few months, Buterin observed. One prototype is nearly finalized, first as a sidechain anchored to the Ethereum base chain via a validator manager contract, followed by tighter integration with the Ethereum base chain. A reference deployment is becoming built-in python atop Py-EVM, with a testnet python in the works.\nButerin wants the Ethereum sharding testnet and eventually, the sharding mainnet to be multi-client from the beginning, with the Ethereum Foundation not supporting any single production deployment.\nThe Ethereum funded team will continue building a deployment in python and other languages possibly, but only as a reference and proof of concept.

At press time, the total valuation of Ripple is $121 billion.\n\nUp by $19 Billion in 24 Hours\nOver the past 24 hours, the price of XRP, Ripple\u2019s native token, has increased by more than 24 percent, to over $3. The market valuation of Ripple increased from below $95 billion to $116 billion, further distancing itself from the third most valuable cryptocurrency in the global market, Ethereum.\nAs usual, the daily trading volume of XRP is heavily concentrated in the South Korean market. Korbit and Bithumb are processing 40 percent of global Ripple trades, accounting for more than $2.2 billion of Ripple\u2019s daily trading volume. \nOn Bithumb, the second largest cryptocurrency trading platform in the world based in Seoul, South Korea, Ripple remains as the most traded cryptocurrency, recording a daily trading volume that is three times larger than that of bitcoin.\nDespite being the largest and most liquid Ripple exchange market, XRP is being traded with a high premium within South Korean cryptocurrency market. On Bithumb and Korbit, Ripple is being traded at $3.5, with a with a 12 percent premium.\nRipple has also started to gain some mainstream media coverage, with news publications demonstrating their readers how to purchase, store, and send Ripple with ease. Such increase in coverage of Ripple by the media and fear of missing out (FOMO)-driven South Market\u2019s push has allowed Ripple to achieve new all-time highs and sustain strong momentum.\nBrad Garlinghouse, the CEO at Ripple, which is responsible for the development of the Ripple blockchain network, stated that the \u201creal use case\u201d sets Ripple apart from other digital assets.\n\u201cCaught up with Joel Comm and Travis Wright on Bad Crypto about Ripple and how its real use case sets it apart from other digital assets, why Ripple is the most efficient solution for cross border payments,\u201d said Garlinghouse.\nBut as with any other cryptocurrency, Ripple was met with some criticism. Earlier today, on January 3, P4man stated that the vision of Ripple to evolve into Swift 2.0 is not realistic, because in order for the Ripple network to become a Swift-like network, banks will need to gain control over it.\n\u201cAs for the moonshot of replacing Swift; first of all, I highly doubt a global consensus protocol is the right approach and could even scale to that level. But also, banks currently control Swift. How likely is it they would relinquish control to a small startup and allow themselves to become beholden to its private currency, that they have no need for?,\u201d P4man wrote in a blog post published on Coindesk.\nSwift 2.0\nIt is not possible to place a market valuation on the Swift network, given that banks have ownership of it and it is the backbone of the entire global banking system. But, like the New York Stock Exchange, if it was valued as a company or a project, its market valuation would be in the trillions.\nEssentially, the current market valuation of Ripple comes from the total addressable market, given the premise that Ripple will someday be able to overtake Swift and evolve into a multi-trillion dollar market.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

It is actually the antithesis of decentralization. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the price continue to rise because I know that the team has a number of community and marketing initiatives in Q1 and Q2.\nI think a lot of that will drive interest. I also think the fact that XRP is now on Bloomberg terminals will drive a lot of awareness and interest from Wall Street and traditional financial players.\u201d\nConditional Valuation\nOver the past week, most of the interest towards Ripple has come from the South Korean and Japanese cryptocurrency markets, triggered by the partnership between SBI Ripple Asia and major Asian banks. Within the first quarter of 2018, more than 90 Japanese and South Korean banks are expected to utilize the Ripple blockchain technology at a large commercial scale, processing many billions of dollars on the network.\nIt can also be said that the current market valuation of Ripple is conditional in the abovementioned accomplishment. If banks struggle or fail to implement the Ripple network at a commercial scale and use it to process real transaction volumes, the market valuation of Ripple could sharply drop.\nIn contrast, if the tests and commercialization of the Ripple network by leading banks in Japan and South Korea are completed seamlessly by the end of quarter 1 in 2018, the price of Ripple also could increase. Because of this condition, analysts are cautious in providing predictions for the price of XRP.\nStill, the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market accounts for more than 40 percent of Ripple\u2019s global trades, even though the daily trading volume of Ripple has increased to $8 billion, significantly higher than that of Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash. It has also achieved 50 percent of bitcoin\u2019s market valuation, becoming the second cryptocurrency to do so over the past 12 months apart from Ethereum.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

These include founders, traditional industry veterans turned ICO participants and everything in-between. The weekly interviews will cover a wide range of questions and try to explore the motivation behind blockchain-based ideas and the problems blockchain technology is being used to solve.\nIn 2017, cryptocurrency exchanges saw more users than some of the world\u2019s largest investment brokerages. The reality is crypto exchanges can be daunting first-time users. Deposits, account verification, fees, various coins and wallets make up just a few aspects of the necessary learning curve.\nUnlike most exchanges, CoinLion is building an exchange that is dedicated to a simple user experience, with a social component that is centered around information sharing. The result is a platform that will include portfolio management, content education, and community incentives. Following a deep dive review on HACKED, I had the chance to catch up with Joshua Dewitt, CoinLion\u2019s CEO, and discuss the platform in more detail and what is in store for 2018.\n1.Tell us a little bit about yourself: \nMy background is in the financial industry. My passion and expertise is in portfolio management and construction. Before starting CoinLion, I was with Merrill Lynch working on a team managing traditional assets. I first got into cryptocurrency through mining. I was fascinated with the technology and the ability to send transactions almost instantly with no middleman for an incredibly low cost.\nThe more I began to mine and trade, I realized that this was going to be a big part of our future and ultimately change the way we transact and interact globally.\n2. What was your inspiration behind CoinLion? How did it all start?\nI was spending much of my time trying to figure out how to effectively manage portfolios of digital assets, but found the lack of professional tools to be frustrating. There were no platforms available that had the tools needed to properly manage a portfilio. There were also no platforms that incentivized users to share information and strategies related to the management of digital assets. This social aspect is something that is valuable not only to professional traders, but casual investors as well. Education is key.\nIn addition, there is a lack of research and analytics in the space. It was out of the desire to solve these problems that CoinLion was founded in early 2017.\u00a0Over the past few months, the development and the growth have been rapid. As the crypto trading space expands, interest has risen dramatically.\n3. What makes you guys different than your competitors?\u00a0\nThe\u00a0CoinLion platform\u00a0consists of three main components working together to maximize the user\u2019s trading experience. The first is a cryptocurrency exchange focused on giving users the best trading experience possible. The second component is a portfolio management tool that allows for the creation and management of cryptocurrency portfolios. The third component is a public profile system that rewards users who create and share portfolios, strategies, and information with other users.\nCoinLion is the first digital asset exchange to integrate all of these components together and deliver powerful trading and management tools that assist users in making smart, controlled, investment processes.\u00a0\n4. What is the biggest problem currently in the market?\nThere are many to name but the three biggest in my opinion are:\n\nExisting exchanges and platforms have failed to deliver a powerful, secure, user-friendly platform that provides the tools, research, and education needed for the beginner, and advanced alike, to effectively manage digital assets.\nCurrently, there is a disconnect between the tools, research, and analytics that exist in the modern financial world and those that are available in the cryptocurrency and digital asset space to properly manage portfolios and execute strategies. This has created a cumbersome and confusing user experience, especially for the beginner.\nTrading platforms today are also riddled with security issues that have caused a significant barrier to entry for a large percentage of the population. There is no trusted platform that provides crypto traders a community to learn, build, and grow their crypto holdings using simple and powerful tools.\n\n5. If there is one thing you could change in the industry, what would it be?\nThe industry is evolving so rapidly and the technology is revolutionary. If I could change one thing, it would be to make it simpler and easier for anyone who wants to get involved to participate. That is really the ultimate goal of CoinLion.\u00a0\n6. What does 2018 have in store for you guys?\nWe are currently in the process of raising funds for the ongoing development of the platform. Our token sale is running until the end of February 2018. We are continuing to build out the CoinLion platform and have an anticipated launch date of July 2018. We expect to see continued growth of new entrants into the market and are excited to provide future users with the tools they need to make smart decisions when it comes to managing digital assets.", "category": "Feature"}

Ethereum, meanwhile, took the first step toward reclaiming the second spot in the rankings from ripple, which was one of the few cryptocurrencies to post a single-day decline.\nAgainst this backdrop, the cryptocurrency market cap once again floated above the $600 billion mark and currently sits at $602 billion. This $18 billion advance translates into a single-day increase of about three percent.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nBitcoin Price Tests $14,000 on Global Markets\nThe bitcoin price set the tone for the day, rising a modest two percent on the global markets even as traders continue to ponder how South Korea\u2019s new bitcoin exchange regulations will affect the flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s local and international valuations.\nBitcoin Price Chart\nOn Bitfinex, bitcoin is currently trading at $13,187, while \u2014 buttressed by South Korea \u2014 its global average its $13,570. This translates into a $227.7 billion market cap, which is roughly 13 times the size of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem on January 1 of last year.\nRipple Price Posts Rare Decline as Ethereum Plots Recovery\nTo the surprise of all but a few XRP diehards, ripple entered 2018 as the second most valuable cryptocurrency following a remarkable year-end rally. Despite this recent performance, however, the ripple price was one of the few cryptocurrencies to post a single-day decline on Monday. On Bitfinex, the ripple price slipped below the $2 mark, while XRP\u2019s global average declined three percent to $2.25.\nRipple Price Chart\nThis pullback reduced ripple\u2019s market cap to $87 billion, perhaps presenting ethereum with an opportunity to reclaim its spot as the second most valuable cryptocurrency. On Monday, the ethereum price increased by five percent and is currently trading at $743 on Bitfinex. Its global average, though, is $768, which works out to a $74.3 billion market cap.\nEthereum Price Chart\nAssuming a static ripple price, ethereum needs to increase by 17 percent to pass XRP in the rankings. Based on the market\u2019s current state, this does not appear likely to happen today. However, if ripple\u2019s Monday pullback is the first signal that its breakneck rally is running out of steam, ethereum could once again boast the second largest market cap in the near future.\nStellar Leads the Altcoin Advance\nDespite poor performances from several top cryptocurrencies, the total altcoin market cap rose by $9 billion on Monday, bringing it to a present value of $375 billion.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nFollowing ripple\u2019s example, both bitcoin cash and cardano posted minor declines for the day, dipping one percent and three percent, respectively. The litecoin price, meanwhile, returned a three percent increase, putting at least a temporary halt to its recent downtrend.\nThe IOTA price managed to assemble a one percent increase, and NEM\u2019s eight percent leap brought its price above dollar parity. The dash price, meanwhile, rose by two percent, ensuring its status above the $1,000 mark.\nThe day\u2019s top performance came from stellar, a newcomer to the top 10. The stellar price rose 25 percent to $0.42, bringing its market cap to $7.4 billion and providing it with a $2 billion edge on 11th-ranked monero.\nWrite to Josiah Wilmoth at josiah.wilmoth(at)cryptocoinsnews.com.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

Some currencies like Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin have risen by at least 50-fold over the past year, with Ripple demonstrating a staggering 330-fold increase in value. \nExperts such as ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees noted that the high transaction fees have largely fueled the growth of alternative cryptocurrencies, as it has become difficult to process small payments using bitcoin.\n\u201cFellow Bitcoiners, are you ever going to realize how problematic these fees are getting?

We just spent $4800 to move 15 BTC in one transaction,\u201d said Voorhees.\nIn a response to a statement from a member of the bitcoin community, Voorhees emphasized that alternative cryptocurrencies have become viable options to process cheaper payments. \u201cLike Litecoin, Dash, ETH or BCH\u2026 chains that still work as peer to peer electronic cash systems,\u201d he added.\nBitcoin still remains as the most liquid and largest cryptocurrency in the market in terms of user activity and developer activity. It has a daily trading volume of over $10 billion and a market valuation of $227 billion.\nHigh profile investors including billionaire hedge fund legend Mike Novogratz suggested that the price of bitcoin could easily surpass $50,000 in 2018, as its market valuation achieves $1 trillion.\n\u201cBitcoin could be at $40,000 at the end of 2018. It easily could.

Any fallout in bitcoin prices would be reflective of developments unique to bitcoin.\nKleintop, whose company manages $320 billion in assets, said he gets asked whether or not bitcoin is a bubble every place he travels throughout the world.\nKleintop is one of several experts who has differed with those who have called bitcoin a bubble waiting to burst.\nGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein recently told Bloomberg he wasn\u2019t willing to \u201cpooh pooh\u201d the cryptocurrency, despite having a certain \u201clevel of discomfort with it\u201d as is the case with anything new.\nMorgan Stanley CEO James Gorman also recently stated that bitcoin is \u201cmore than just a fad\u201d that \u201cisn\u2019t inherently bad.\u201d\nDa Hong Fei, founder of NEO, the 12th largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $160.852 million, has said that even if bitcoin is a bubble that eventually bursts, the cryptocurrency will recover and even become bigger.\nBullish on 2018\nKleintop said 2018 will be a strong year for equity valuations, and the first year for back-to-back, broad economic growth in more than 10 years. The top 45 economies all are expected to grow next year, pointing to further earnings growth.\nIn 2017, earnings increased every month as stocks rose, he said.\nYield curves are flattening slightly, Kleintop said, which is one area of concern for 2018. The yield curve could portend a recession in 2019 or thereafter.\nRisks To Watch Out For\nThere are risks to watch out for in 2018, he said. There is a possible slowing of China\u2019s economic growth, which would impact the entire world.\nGeopolitics and natural disasters are always a concern, he said. Any slowdown in economic growth in 2018 could be adversely affected by politics or natural disasters.\nKleintop is not concerned about any action by the Federal Reserve that would lead to inflation. He said inflation is beginning to rise, meaning the personalities at central banks are less important. He said the Fed will likely announce two or three rate hikes in 2018. This will not be a big risk since the market is prepared for these hikes.\nKleintop encourages investors to think globally in 2018. Global stocks have outperformed the U.S. market in the last year or two. Global stocks are more cyclical and more inflation sensitive. In addition, the valuations are more attractive.\nAlso read: NEO founder: Bitcoin may be a bubble, but so what?\nDiversification Urged\nIt is important for investors to diversify, he said. Investors typically look for a certain country or sector to do well, but for the first time in 20 years, there are lower correlations between how different markets behave in relation to each other. This points to the best benefit from diversification in 20 years.\nKleintop said the tech sector outlook is strong, driven by business spending in this area. He said more business spending on technology could witness more earnings momentum in 2018.\nKleintop said tax reform is happening worldwide, as countries cut corporate taxes. Besides the recent activity on this front in the U.S., France has proposed corporate tax cuts for 2018, Japan has already enacted some, and the issue is under discussion in Germany.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

On December 13, 2017, India\u2019s Income Tax (IT) department swooped in on at least nine bitcoin exchanges to look into alleged tax evasion before announcing its intention to impose capital gains taxes on adopters.\nDespite numerous calls \u2013 including one mandate by the Supreme Court \u2013 to introduce a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, Jaitley stressed the government will not engage in \u201cknee-jerk reactions\u201d to force guidelines and/or regulations for exchanges.\nInstead, the government is waiting on a report from the interdisciplinary committee tasked to research and propose a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, Jaitley added.\nJaitley\u2019s public comments at the Indian Parliament today follows a public notice by the Ministry of Finance that cautioned citizens against investments in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, likening them to ponzi schemes.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

Initially, after the December 13 emergency meeting to discuss the state of the cryptocurrency market was held, the South Korean government introduced the following four regulations:\n\nPrevent unaccredited investors from dealing with losses through highly volatile cryptocurrencies. \nPrevent strictly regulated cryptocurrency exchanges from operating as speculative platforms for unaccredited investors. \nRequest banks and exchanges to ensure underaged investors and foreigners cannot open trading accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges. \nTemporarily suspend institutional investors and retail investors from investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\nBy the end of December, the South Korean government released three more regulations and emphasized that it will impose practical regulations by closely monitoring the cryptocurrency market. The government noted that it does not intend to restrict the growth of the cryptocurrency market and the development of innovative blockchain-based technologies.\n\nSouth Korean govt\u2019s #Bitcoin regulations from this week:\n1. Gov\u2019t will impose regulations based on global trend.\n2. Special cryptocurrency law drafted, *exchanges not compliant with policies* cannot operate.\n3. Open towards bitcoin / blockchain tech development.\nOptimistic.\n\u2014 Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) December 28, 2017\nHowever, in regards to the South Korean government\u2019s statement that it intends to close down exchanges that are not in compliance with local regulations, professor Yoo noted that the regulations introduced by the South Korean government are premature and too early for the market.\nYoo expressed his concerns over the strict regulations the South Korean government plans to implement, given that harsh regulations can restrict the exponential growth rate of the South Korean cryptocurrency market.\n\u201cI think the decision seems too quick. We don\u2019t need to do that, but they worry about fraud or such. But there\u2019s no guarantee that this shutdown will pass Congress, so we have time. Governments, you know, are risk-averse. But economically, I think it\u2019s not a good decision. There\u2019s no need to hurry,\u201d said Yoo.\nCautious Approach\nCurrently, the South Korean government is intentionally imposing strict regulations for the cryptocurrency market because of the rapidly increasing number of speculators in the space. South Korea has become the largest cryptocurrency markets for several cryptocurrencies like Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. Ripple, in particular, has nearly 50 percent of its trades processed by South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges like Bithumb and Korbit.\nBut, Yoo explained that the government should avoid restricting the development of new technologies and development of the local market. Since any technology can be misused for criminal activities, Yoo emphasized that the government should not focus on that aspect of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a delicate balance involved. But a lot of governments are looking at this very carefully. Some are even considering putting their currencies on the blockchain system. The biggest challenge facing bitcoin now is the potential for misuse, but that\u2019s true of any new technology.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

According to Malwarebytes, a \u201cdrive-by\u201d mining campaign recently redirected millions of Android users to a website that hijacked their devices to mine the privacy-centric cryptocurrency using Coinhive .\nThe campaign worked by redirecting users to a page that told them their device was \u201cshowing suspicious surfing behavior.\u201d As such, they needed to verify they were human by solving a CAPTCHA, while their device was used to mine Monero \u201cin order to recover server costs incurred by bot traffic.\u201d\nAll users had to do was solve the CAPTCHA and click a \u201ccontinue\u201d button. Once solved, they would be redirected to Google\u2019s home page, which researchers noted was an odd choice. Malwarebytes details that it first spotted the \u201cdrive-by\u201d campaign last month, but that it could\u2019ve been around since November 2017. The exact trigger that captured users isn\u2019t clear, but researchers believes infected apps with malicious ads did the trick.\nTheir post reads:\n\u201cWhile Android users may be redirected from regular browsing, we believe that infected apps containing ad modules are loading similar chains leading to this cryptomining page. This is unfortunately common in the Android ecosystem, especially with so-called \u201cfree\u201d apps.\u201d\nMalwarebytes researchers weren\u2019t able to identify all the domains users were being redirected to. They managed to identify five domains, and concluded that these received about 800,000 visits per day, with an average of four minutes spent mining, per user.\nTo find out the number of hashes being produced, researchers note, a conservative rate of 10h/s was used. This low hash rate, coupled with the four minute average spent on time, means the hackers behind it could only be making \u201ca few thousand dollars\u201d per month.\nThe Cryptojacking Trend\nNotably, researchers discovered the drive-by campaign while studying a separate malware dubbed EITest. They were testing various chains that often led to tech support scams on Windows, but soon found that things were different when using Android.\nThe ongoing cryptojacking trend seemingly began when torrent-index website the Pirate Bay started using it as a potential alternative to ads. Since then, bad actors took advantage of the code Coinhive provides to mine Monero, and used it on Google Chrome extensions, UFC\u2019s website, and even Starbucks\u2019 Wi-Fi.\nWhile on their PCs users can block cryptocurrency mining scripts by using anti-malware programs on their machines and browsing the web through browsers with inbuilt tools like Opera and Brave, Android users are advised to stick to Google\u2019s Play Store, and use security software.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

These changes will not be noticeable to ordinary XMR users, but they will alter the network\u2019s hashing algorithm enough that Cryptonight ASIC miners would become obsolete following every fork.\nBut in case these planned PoW adjustments are not enough to disincentivize the development of ASIC miners for Cryptonight, Monero will \u201cperform an emergency hard fork to curb any potential threat from ASICs.\u201d\nTransition to ASICs Must Be Egalitarian\nThis proactive stance, developers said, will ensure that Monero mining remains relatively egalitarian and consequently, decentralized \u2014 at least until such time the same can be said of the ASIC mining industry.\n\u201cASICs may be an inevitable development for any Proof of Work,\u201d said the post, which was attributed to dEBRYUNE, dnaleor, and the Monero project, \u201cbut we feel that any transition to an ASIC-dominated network needs to be as egalitarian as possible in order to foster decentralization.

While securities regulators are looking for ways to protect investors from any fraudulent activity that might arise in unscrupulous ICOs, Powell, while speaking to CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Dubai, put the burden to investors. But he also offered a bullish take on the cryptocurrency market in 2018, pointing to a future combined market cap worth $1 trillion.\n\u201cI think ultimately consumers need to look out for themselves, look into the fundamentals of any coin and not rely on any particular exchange to protect them from market volatility,\u201d Powell said.\nIt\u2019s not that Kraken, the largest bitcoin exchange based on euro volume and liquidity, doesn\u2019t have traders\u2019 backs. The exchange has a rigorous vetting process for any new coins looking to list there. But considering that Kraken is one of the leading exchanges that ICOs want to list their tokens on, along with the likes of Bittrex, Poloniex, and Binance, that\u2019s no small feat.\n\u201cWe make no promises about the future of any coin, things can change when you raise $1 billion in 10 minutes,\u201d he added.\nThe comments come on the heels of a multiple-day systemwide outage that Kraken suffered in January\u00a0while they were upgrading their trade engine, an event that was supposed to take a couple of hours. And while Kraken wasn\u2019t hacked, the outage spooked cryptocurrency traders.\nPowell\u2019s remarks on the risks associated with cryptocurrencies come as policymakers around the world are grappling for tighter control over the market. EU regulators, for instance, just issued a joint warning to investors about \u201chighly speculative\u201d cryptocurrencies, urging them\u00a0to refrain from investing more than they can afford to lose.\nBullish Call\nWhile sobering, Powell\u2019s remarks weren\u2019t all cautious.

Bitcoin futures beat their exchange-traded fund products to the market, with securities regulators blocking the latter given its appeal to Main Street investors. Bitcoin futures, meanwhile, fall into the derivatives camp, which is a more sophisticated product with fewer restrictions.\nR3 vs. Ripple\nR3 competes with Ripple and will be going head-to-head with the XRP founder by developing its own DLT-fueled cross-border payments platform. The two companies are locked in a legal dispute over an options contract whose value has climbed from $1.1 billion to more than $16 billion alongside the price of the XRP currency at its peak. R3 was contracted to purchase 5 billion XRP at a preset price through September 2019, but Ripple reportedly reneged on that agreement.\nVirtual Currencies\nNot to be outdone, virtual currencies also have a place on the CFTC\u2019s Feb. 14 agenda to discuss \u201cvirtual currencies, related futures products, and market and regulatory\u00a0developments and challenges.\u201d For that discussion, they\u2019re bringing in Jerry Brito, executive director of\u00a0nonprofit Coin Center, which is an advocacy group for cryptocurrencies.\nWhile details of the meeting remain sparse, the Coin Center in recent weeks published a blog on how regulators can provide oversight to the market without stifling innovation. They pulled from the guidelines from the Bill Clinton era in the nineties during the dot-com craze in which the policies dictate that:\n\u201c[The] private sector should lead,\u201d that \u201cgovernments should avoid undue restrictions on electronic commerce\u201d and that \u201cwhere governmental involvement is needed, its aim should be to support and enforce a predictable, minimalist, consistent and simple legal environment for commerce.\u201d\nAs long as they are aligning themselves with organizations that are engaged in digital coins and the technology that drives them, regulators such as the CFTC will remain equipped for discussions with lawmakers, such as at the recent hearing on Capitol Hill to discuss regulation. That event was largely seen as a win for cryptocurrencies, particularly in light of CFTC chairman Christopher Giancarlo\u2019s intrigue about the budding industry.", "category": "News"}

Now, though, it seems that they are reaching the bottom of the barrel.\nThis latest assault comes from researchers at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI) and other similar institutions, who complain that they are having trouble acquiring the resources they need to expand operations at their observatories.\nThe culprit? \u2014 a computer chip shortage caused by soaring demand among cryptocurrency miners.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to use the latest GPUs [graphics processing units]\u2026 and we can\u2019t get \u2019em,\u201d SETI researcher Dan Werthimer told the BBC. \u201cThis is a new problem, it\u2019s only happened on orders we\u2019ve been trying to make in the last couple of months.\u201d\nAlthough Bitcoin and other coins that run on ASIC-compatible hashing algorithms can no longer be mined profitably with GPUs, many networks \u2014 most notably Ethereum \u2014 remain ASIC-resistant and are thus most effectively mined with the same chips that are used for gaming and other general-purpose applications.\nAs CCN has reported, cryptocurrency mining-related GPU demand has soared in recent months and does not appear to have been substantively affected by the recent market correction. The resulting GPU shortage has incurred the wrath of gamers, and chip manufacturers AMD and Nvidia have seen their share prices soar even as they struggle to keep up with demand.\nBut, it seems, gamers aren\u2019t the GPU boom\u2019s only victims.\nSETI, as well as other observatories searching for alien life, depend on GPUs to scan data from listening arrays in an attempt to intercept extraterrestrial communications.\n\u201cAt SETI we want to look at as many frequency channels as we possibly can because we don\u2019t know what frequency ET will be broadcasting on and we want to look for lots of different signal types \u2013 is it AM or FM, what communication are they using?\u201d explained Dr. Werthimer, who is chief scientist at the Berkeley SETI Research Center.\nLately, though, these radio-astronomers have been forced to pay exorbitant premiums to acquire new chips \u2014 if they can find them at all.\n\u201cThat\u2019s limiting our search for extra-terrestrials, to try to answer the question, \u2018Are we alone? Is there anybody out there?\u2019,\u201d Werthimer complained.\nOf course, demand for GPUs will likely decrease as Bitmain and other cryptocurrency mining hardware manufacturers develop ASICs for more Proof-of-Work (PoW) hashing algorithms and Ethereum begins its transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS).\nFor now, though, it seems that the search for alien life has hit a wall \u2014 a buy wall.", "category": "Mining"}

Goldman Sachs had predicted a successful quarter for Nvidia last month. GPU mining has been the driving force for Nvidia lately because of the popularity of their cards among miners.\nLast year, when the cryptocurrency market exploded, it became extremely lucrative to set up GPU-Based mining for currencies like Ethereum and ZCash. With the increase in price for Ethereum and it\u2019s general difficulty, the ROI is usually less than six months. There\u2019s so much demand for GPUs that there\u2019s usually a hefty premium when being sold by retailers.\nThough GPUs have been selling like hot cakes, Nvidia has not been happy with their consumer products being used by miners. Their gaming customers have not been able to get their hands on GPUs either due to the premium pricing or due to the general unavailability for months. Nvidia\u2019s spokesperson Boris B\u00f6hles previously stated that gamers will always be their priority and not miners.\nNvidia had previously\u00a0asked their retailers to control the sales and look for ways to bring down the price of cards in the market. But no such thing has happened yet since retailers are not going to turn down extra income.\nNvidia\u2019s Founder and CEO Jensen Huang spoke to Barron\u2019s right after the earnings call, and when asked about cryptocurrencies, he said it was a real part of their business last quarter, but a very small part. He stressed the rise of Nvidia\u2019s powerful chips in Data centers, A.I. and Self-Driving Cars to be the real factor behind their growth.\nWhen questioned further on if he was satisfied with the demand for Nvidia cards due to miners, he answered: \u201cCrypto is a real thing \u2013 it\u2019s not going away\u201d. When pushed further, he replied that it\u2019s not relevant since its all just demand for GPUs. The company is more focused on attracting A.I. and A.R. applications for their GPUs since they showcase the real possibility of their cards.\nWhen asked about his views on cryptocurrencies, he said:\n\u201cThis year, the world is starting to come to terms with the existence of crypto. It\u2019s based on blockchain, and it\u2019s very secure and very low overhead. I think there\u2019s clearly real utility. It\u2019s a real phenomenon, and so everyone is coming to terms with it. I\u2019m not against the concept of virtual currency \u2014 it\u2019s as real as virtual goods, and video games. And as you know, tens of millions of virtual goods are created and shared and sold in virtual reality, and people invest thousands of hours to create space ships in space that they battle against each other. So, the concept of virtual goods and virtual worlds and virtual currency all ties together.\u201d\nFrom the interview, it\u2019s not clear if the company is going to do anything about the demand for their GPUs in the market. Average gaming consumers are not happy since the cards are never in stock, and when they are, there\u2019s a significant premium on it. Miners are always looking for latest cards to make profits. Last year, Ethereum Miners leased Boeing 747s to ship Nvidia & AMD cards so that they could be plugged into their network as quickly as possible.", "category": "Mining"}

The authority first issued an early official draft to clarify tax guidelines for cryptocurrency adopters in January 2017 following repeated requests from the community to clarify the government\u2019s stance on the taxation of cryptocurrencies.\nWith its updated circular and a final draft in place, the authority will now press ahead with taxation guidelines for assets wherein individual investors will be subject to the 25% capital gains tax for profits from their cryptocurrency holdings. In addition, businesses and exchanges trading cryptocurrencies will be liable to pay a 17% value-added tax (VAT). Notably, individual investors will be exempt from paying VAT as cryptocurrencies used for investment purposes are markedly seen as intangible assets. Individuals who are involved in mining or trading cryptocurrencies will be subjected to the VAT of 17%.\nThe Authority\u2019s official stance on classifying cryptocurrencies as \u201cassets\u201d coincides with a similar approach\u00a0taken by the country\u2019s central bank. In a public speech in January, Bank of Israel (BOI) deputy governor Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg stated the BOI\u2019s position on cryptocurrencies \u201cis that they should be viewed as a financial asset, with all that entails.\u201d\nThe Tax Authority\u2019s final draft on cryptocurrency taxation follows recent moves in January wherein tax officials published draft legislation to collect taxes from initial coin offerings (ICOs), part of its wider focused move to collect from the cryptocurrency sector.\n\u201cThe Tax Authority is monitoring the technological developments and its working to provide an answer regarding the tax implications of virtual currency transactions and the issuance of digital tokens,\u201d said the authority\u2019s director Moshe Asher at the time.

These include founders, traditional industry veterans turned ICO participants and everything in-between. The weekly interviews will cover a wide range of questions and try to explore the motivation behind blockchain-based ideas and the problems blockchain technology is being used to solve.\nWhen I first spoke with the UBIQUICOIN team, it was evident that they did not think like most blockchain startups. Every aspect of the business model is geared towards protecting and providing, from creating a seven-figure\u00a0financial guarantee for their ICO to building a cryptocurrency that limits price volatility.\nThe UBIQUICOIN ecosystem is unique as it is built on a two-coin structure. The Transaction coin is price stable and to be used in real-world transactions. The Progressive coin can be seen as a more traditional investment vehicle, with a chance to appreciate and capture up to a 20% revenue share of platform profits.\nI had the chance to speak to spoke with UBIQUICOIN\u2019s CEO, Jeff Mahony, on how his team will help eliminate the friction costs associated with investment and commerce and provide financial inclusion for people around the world.\n\n1. Tell us a little bit about yourself:\nI am going to focus on the team here as we share a very similar professional backgrounds. Our management team has a long history of working in financial services and technology with a particular focus on providing affordable, high quality services to lower income individuals. The emergence of blockchain technology provided a natural avenue for us to extend our philosophy to a much broader audience of underbanked and unbanked individuals on a global scale.\n2. What was your inspiration behind Ubiquicoin? How did it all start?\nOur management team is comprised of financial and technology veterans that have been following the cryptocurrency industry for many years (well before it entered the mainstream media). As the size of the market rapidly increased and investors flocked to all forms of ICOs, we were struck by the inability of these cryptocurrencies to make the leap from speculative investment to a usable form of currency.\nBy taking a step back and assessing the positives and negatives with current offerings, we developed a unique two-coin solution coupled with a more efficient consensus mechanism to provide a truly usable currency while retaining upside potential for investors.\n3. What makes you guys different than other financial services ICOs? How can you truly limit volatility?\u00a0\nThere are several things that differentiate us and a few key components to our value proposition, including a model that can indeed reduce price volatility:\n\nTwo-Coin Approach: We are using a two-coin approach: one coin for transactions that has a stable value (\u201cTransaction Coins\u201d) and one for wealth appreciation that will freely trade on exchanges (\u201cProgressive Coins,\u201d which are offered in the ICO). This unique solution solves the price volatility problem for transactions while retaining upside potential for investors.\nAsset Backing: Our Transaction Coins are fully backed by cash and cash equivalents to ensure they have price stability.\nDownside Protection: Our Progressive Coins have a two-year $1.00 per coin financial guarantee that gets distributed to coin holders upon a triggering event.\nRevenue Share: Progressive Coin holders will receive a monthly dividend of up to 20% of the revenue generated in our ecosystem.\nProprietary Consensus Mechanism: Our \u201cProof of Majority\u201d consensus mechanism will deliver sub-second transaction times, requires very low computer processing requirements, and is highly secure (technical paper available on our website).\n\n4. What is the biggest problem currently in the market?\nThere are several significant problems facing the market, but I will touch on three of the primary ones. First is the high volatility of prices, which makes such currencies extremely difficult to use for real-world financial transactions (i.e., as a currency not just an investment) because there is a high degree of uncertainty of what actual value being exchanged or what that value will be 10 minutes later.\nThe second biggest issue is that transaction times are long and unpredictable, primarily due to the reliance on the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, which is inherently inefficient and processor intensive. Like high volatility, long transaction times are a killer of real-world usability.\nA third problem is that the overall euphoria surrounding cryptocurrencies has led to a significant amount of undisciplined investing, which has several negative consequences (e.g., more opportunity fraud, potential investment bubble, the risk of significant investor losses, etc.).\n5. If there is one thing you could change in the industry, what would it be?\nUnlike many other firms, we would like to see increased regulation. We are in the very early innings of blockchain\u2019s worldwide impact and, like all early-stage industries, it has opened the door to companies that cut corners, take advantage of investors, and fail to deliver on their business plans. Increased regulation will help bring stability to the market, protect investors, and provide an environment for well-run companies to thrive.\n6. What does 2018 have in store for UBIQUICOIN?\n2018 will be a very big year for us.\u00a0 We will be launching our ICO in the first quarter of 2018 and expect to announce several very exciting things related to patents, partnerships, and technology that we believe will help elevate us above the crowd and establish UBIQUICOIN as a leader and forward thinker in the ever-evolving blockchain industry.", "category": "Feature"}

Even Apple\u2019s co-founder, Steve Wozniak, lost seven Bitcoins to an online fraud. The latest company to join the growing list of scammers is BTC Global. The binary options trading platform reportedly pocketed more than $50 million Bitcoins from people in South Africa, America, Australia and others.\nMore than 27,500 people filed complaints against the company to South Africa\u2019s\u00a0Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, usually known as the \u2018Hawks\u2018. According to spokesperson\u00a0Captain Lloyd Ramovha, \u201cI have spoken to one of the investigators in our team and he has confirmed that this matter came to them about two weeks ago. There are in excess of 27\u201a500 complainants with many outside South Africa.\u00a0The amount is over $50-million and could rise as more victims come forward.\u201d\nWhat is BTC Global?\nBTC Global was launched in Sep. 25, 2017 by \u2018famous\u2019 trader Steven Twain. His success in binary options trading led people to believe that the platform was trustworthy. However, the set-up was criticized and called out for being a scam ever since it was released. Reviews questioned the \u201cunmatched returns\u201d offered by the company.\nBTC Global first allowed people to purchase BTC from the platform, followed by an advise to invest in their company to get 2% to 14% returns weekly.\u00a0Victims told South African newspaper Times LIVE that their investments varied from $1,341.92 (R16,000) to $0.1 million (R1.4 million).\nInitially, people received dividends that were unpredictable, but two weeks ago, Twain disappeared from the online world. People immediately started reporting the company and investigations began a few days later. Ramovha explained the situation, \u201cThe investigation is in its infancy. I also cannot say whether it is a Ponzi scheme. BTC Global is being investigated for contravening the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act.\u201d\nThe rest of the team published status updates on Facebook as well as an announcement on the official\u00a0website. According to the BTC Global team, payment details were sent to Twain as per routine on Feb. 18, 2017 \u2013\u00a0but the team didn\u2019t get a response from him. Ever since that day, no one in the leadership and admin team has heard a word from Twain. The announcement further stated:\n\nThe admin team cannot locate him. If anyone has ANY information on how we can get in contact with him please get in touch and let us know.\nWe call for the threats, harassment and violence on leaders and admin to stop. It is unfathomable that people can behave like this. If you feel you\u2019ve had a crime committed against you, you need to follow the legal procedures to deal with the matter.\nWe are as shocked and angry as everyone. But we all knew the risks involved in placing funds with Steven.\nWe all became complacent with Steven. And all of us funded him independently.\nUntil Steven Twain resurfaces or is found there is nothing the admin team can do.\n\nOne of the team members, Cheri Ward, also filed criminal charges against a man who \u201cthreatened her at her home\u201d. Others are also worried since their home addresses and phone numbers have been posted all over the internet by angry investors.", "category": "News"}

The Independent Nuclear Claims Tribunal awarded the islands $2.3 billion in health and property damages but that has gone unpaid.\nThe Marshallese Islands\u2019 move to embrace its own cryptocurrency as legal tender would effectively lower its dependence on the United States Dollar. Details are scarce and it remains to be seen if the Sovereign could supplant the USD altogether.\nFor now, the RMI is looking likely to figure among the earliest countries in the world to adopt an official cryptocurrency.

This significant uptick in usage levels can also be attributed to a number of major exchanges and wallet providers such as Coinbase and Bittrex\u00a0finally implementing this technology into their platforms. This uptick means that there could be a significant decrease in global bitcoin transaction fees and times.\n\nThe Advantage\nSegregated Witness (SegWit) is a way of bundling transaction together into blocks, which is a much more efficient way for transactions to be processed.\nThe Bitcoin network has experienced high levels of congestion since its popularity exploded in 2017, with issues abound as to how to scale the network. This led to higher fees and slower transaction times which were turning a lot of people away from using Bitcoin.\nThe adoption of SegWit is aimed at drastically reducing this level of congestion.\nThe main issue that has been holding back the widespread adoption of SegWit across the space is that it has to be specifically enabled on wallets and exchanges. This means you need to have specific SegWit wallet addresses and these cannot be used to bridge non-SegWit and SegWit transactions.\nGrowing Adoption\nThankfully, the adoption levels of this technology have been growing rapidly in recent days due to the new update and the adoption by exchanges.\nThe use of SegWit as a percentage of total daily bitcoin transaction had been averaging around the 15% mark for some time up until last week when these events have caused a steady uptick in adoption levels.\nIn the past 24 hours alone, SegWit usage levels have hit peak levels of adoption at the 30% of total Bitcoin transactions mark.\nMonday the 26th of February saw the release of the latest Bitcoin Core update labeled v0 16.0 and this provided full support to SegWit scaling technology.\nThere are other improvements that have been made as part of this update, but SegWit support and adoption is the major aspect that most people are focusing on. Since SegWit was initially released in August 2017, widespread adoption of this technology has been something that Bitcoin users have been constantly requesting.\nWhile a lot of the significant wallet provides and exchanges have taken their time implementing this technology, eventually growing pressure from their users as a result of slow transaction times and high fees pushed them to do something.\nThis adoption will also lead to further significant improvements to Bitcoin in the future, such as the implementation of the Lightning Network which might allow transaction times and fees to trend close to zero.\nThis is an exciting time for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole as a breath of fresh air has been blown into the markets, with prices\u00a0reacting positively to this news.", "category": "Bitcoin Technology"}

Bitcoin has remained above the $10,500 mark, despite a major sell volume that led the cryptocurrency to decline from $11,000 to $10,300.\nBitcoin and Ethereum\nEarlier today, on February 28, a large sell volume across most major cryptocurrency exchanges including Bitfinex led the price of bitcoin to drop by more than $700 within a span of three hours. Since then, bitcoin has rebounded to $10,500, but volumes remain low on many exchanges.\n\nMore importantly, the daily trading volume of Tether, a cryptocurrency that is backed at 1:1 ratio with the US dollar, has spiked to $2.5 billion, indicating that cryptocurrency traders are using Tether to hedge the value of major cryptocurrencies. It is unlikely that traders are selling Tether and allocating their funds into other cryptocurrencies, because the market valuation of the market has fallen by over $18 billion since February 27.\nBased on the price trend of bitcoin, Ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies throughout the past week, it is unlikely that the market will enter a strong bull market in the short-term. It is more likely that the market will remain highly volatile in the $450 billion region both in the upside and downside, before it leads a strong rally to its previous levels in January.\nIn late 2017, when the price of cryptocurrencies achieved all-time highs, extremely optimistic media coverage coaxed investors outside of the cryptocurrency market, especially in the finance sector, to invest heavily in the cryptocurrency market. As the price of major cryptocurrencies plunged, many casual investors and newcomers suffered major losses. \nAs such, analysts expected the market to experience a long-term bear market, similar to that of 2014, due to the abrupt fall in the value of bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies in the market, including tokens. \nHowever, the market has bounced back reasonably fast, and at this juncture, it is possible that the market could begin a swift recovery process throughout March and April, potentially back to the $600 billion region. Throughout the recovery, as evidently portrayed in the daily transaction volumes of bitcoin and Ethereum, large dips and minor corrections will occur frequently, and the market will continue to be highly volatile.\nEthereum for instance, which peaked at $979 this month, remains below $860, and has been outperformed by bitcoin this month. Although it has only fallen by around 40 percent from its all-time high, it is struggling to sustain strong momentum for a short-term spike in value.\nBill Gates\nThe controversial claims and false statements of influential figures like Bill Gates are also affecting the public\u2019s viewpoint on cryptocurrencies. \nThis week, Gates stated that cryptocurrencies are anonymous, only used for drugs, and are linked to deaths, three claims that are factually incorrect. Bitcoin is transparent and not anonymous by nature and 95 percent of drug purchases are made by fiat money like the US dollar.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

This announcement was made at the first official Bitcoin Private Conference held in Austin, Texas.\nIn the last 24 hours, the price has ranged from $7.15 to $122.32. The price began a slight decline in the past week, beginning the week at $157.37. In the past month, the price has varied from $57.24 to $196.67.\nThe price reached an all-time high of $235.32 on Jan. 7, after emerging from the low single digits for the first time in late December. The price began climbing on Dec. 20, 2017, when it was $4.53.\nManifesto Posted\nOn Dec. 8, Creighton tweeted\u00a0that he was going to be teaming up with another ZClassic founder in order to plan more active development for the project. Following that tweet, Creighton posted an entire manifesto one week later on the ZClassic Subreddit, detailing his plan for a new Bitcoin fork called \u201cBitcoin Private.\u201d\nThe fork would create a derivative of bitcoin that utilizes the same privacy protocols as ZClassic, which would enable users to send shielded transactions that hide transacting individuals and values.\nZClassic originally forked from Zcash to eliminate the 20% founders reward that Zcash put in place for the first four years. Although Zcash is limited to 21 million coins, a portion is allocated to founders, investors, employees, and advisors to the company. The founders\u2019 reward allocation will eventually be dropped in 2020 due to it being limited to the first set block reward, however, this still accounts for 10% of the entire supply.\nThis move was similar to the Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash splits, in which the original code base was forked due to an ideological difference. It contains the same nuts and bolts as the original blockchain, with a few tweaked parameters.\nAlso read: ZClassic spikes 100x in December with \u2018Bitcoin Private\u2019 fork approaching\nPrice Posts Gains\nSince news of the fork grew in mid-December, ZClassic has seen significant price movement.\nMany attributed the price action to individuals who wish to capitalize on the derivative produced from the fork without having to pay the exorbitant price for bitcoin. Investors may see ZClassic as an easier way of obtaining more of the forked cryptocurrency at a cheaper rate, considering that ZClassic is currently trading at a fraction of the price of bitcoin.\nThe popularity of recent bitcoin forks has had both exchanges and wallets in a frenzy due to user requests for support. After Bitcoin Cash forked in August, and Bitcoin Gold forked in October, derivative attempts have been commonplace.\nSome have likened the strategy to an initial coin offering by calling the process an \u201cinitial fork offering\u201d due to the increase in frequency.\nCurrently, the only known way to receive this new form of bitcoin derivative is by storing ZClassic in the project\u2019s official wallet.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

So much so that reports suggest using GPUs to mine cryptocurrencies is stopping us from finding aliens, as these are also used in observatories. New data shows crypto miners actually bought 3 million GPUs last year, worth roughly $776 million.\nThis, according to a new report published by Jon Peddie Research (JPR) that found AMD is emerging as the primary cryptocurrency \u2018mining rush\u2019 benefactor over Nvidia. The numbers have a major impact on the market as a whole and have even incurred the wrath of gamers, while chip manufacturers have seen the value of their shares soar\nDr. Jon Peddie, president of Jon Peddie Research, stated:\n\u201cGaming has been and will continue to be the primary driver for GPU sales, augmented by the demand from cryptocurrency miners. We expect demand to slacken from the miners as margins drop in response increasingly utilities costs and supply and demand forces that drive up AIB prices.\u201d\nAMD\u2019s market share reportedly increased by around 8.1 percent, while Nvidia\u2019s share went down by 6 percent. Last year, notably, the GPU market as a whole dipped 4.8 percent. The preference for AMD over Nvidia could be justified by the lower price tag in its GPUs. Nvidia\u2019s CEO has recently stated cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t going away, and the company has prioritized gamers over cryptocurrency miners amid the graphics card shortage.\nNvidia\u2019s move, however, isn\u2019t believed to have been what drove AMD\u2019s sales up, but rather the potential ROI (return on investment) cryptocurrency miners could obtain by buying cheaper graphics cards from AMD.\nLast year, both companies entertained the idea of creating cheaper cryptocurrency mining GPUs, although the gaming market is still their primary concern. JTR\u2019s analysis notes that cryptocurrency miners can be, for now, an attractive audience for chip manufacturers, which means prices aren\u2019t likely going down anytime soon.\nAs a solution, Dr. Peddie suggests gamers use their GPUs to mine cryptocurrencies when they aren\u2019t using them for gaming.

Things like locking and unlocking a vehicle, parking, or even enterprise usage such as loaning out the company car to an employee are all made easier by way of the blockchain.\nEspecially useful is the fact that blockchains are essentially public ledgers. Because all transactions (in this case, actions involving the vehicle) are recorded in an immutable ledger, gathering data about driver behavior and vehicle performance will be much easier to track.\nCar owners would theoretically be able to monitor who accessed their vehicle, by whom and when. This could play a major factor in expanding the \u201csharing\u201d economy which has exploded over the past few years.\nFurthermore, it opens up a world of possibilities with P2P transactions between vehicle owners. Instead of using a credit card to refill their gas tank or recharge their car battery, drivers could send each other the equivalent of \u201cPorscheCoins,\u201d to pitch in for a night out on the town.\nBy integrating their cars with the blockchain, Porsche also capitalizes on the \u201cblockchain mania\u201d sweeping the world. Film giant Kodak recently rented out their name to KodakCoin \u201ca photo-centric cryptocurrency to empower photographers and agencies to take greater control in image rights management.\u201d\nAfter Kodak made their announcement, their stock price tripled. At the time of this writing, it has since leveled off to merely double its price before the announcement. Not bad for a company that had appeared to lose all relevancy in a rapidly-advancing world of technology.\nAnother interesting example is The Long Island Ice Tea Company. Their stock price doubled after announcing that it was changing it\u2019s name to Long Blockchain, drastically changing their business model overnight.\nWhile this move by Porsche seems genuine and not a ploy to woo investors, it will doubtless have the effect of exciting them nonetheless. Porsche has not announced their own digital currency yet, nor even hinted at it \u2013 but the temptation to cash in on \u201ccrypto mania\u201d may prove to be too great for the German automaker.\nThe real question is: who is this XAIN company, and how did they secure the deal with Porsche to manage their blockchain division in the first place?\nA closer look reveals that XAIN won the blockchain-centric \u201cPorsche Innovation Contest\u201d in summer 2017, placing first out of one hundred contestants. After the contest, teams from different departments within Porsche worked together with XAIN to develop apps that intergrated with the cars\u2019 computer systems.\nThe founders of XAIN, Leif-Nissen Lundbaek and Felix Hahmann, got their start in the automotive industry. Their pedigree includes working with the University of Oxford and Imperial College London on a blockchain system which reduces the electricity-consumption of cryptocurrency mining. One could imagine how that would come in handy when integrating blockchain-based apps in automobiles.

Then, the buyer insisted on paying him $14,500 for $9,000 worth Bitcoins to entrap him. So he received the money and sent Bitcoins worth less than $10,000 which he claims is still legal.\nRockoons insists that he never does any transaction above $10,000 and that he only did this one since he was in need of cash. He also claimed that the money was paid by cash in an envelope and the person had only contacted him through text messages.\nMorgan Rockoons was locked up in jail for five days before he was released. He is fighting the charges in court and has taken to Twitter to ask donations for his legal fees which he expects to be around $150,000 \u2013 $300,000. He\u2019s been trying to appeal to the community, by calling his case an attack on Bitcoin. He\u2019s already received some donation, and he intends to pay his lawyers in Bitcoin.\nThough Rockoons took to Twitter to tell his side of the story, not everyone is buying it. Some people feel he should\u2019ve known something was wrong here when someone offered to pay him $14,500 for Bitcoins worth just $9,000.", "category": "Bitcoin Crime"}

We sadly witnessed this during our ICO, so we decided to show where the main traps are hiding \u2013 and how you can protect yourself.\n\nTelegram / Email\n\nAlmost all companies that do an ICO have established Telegram groups, which are an important information medium for a token sale. There you can communicate with employees of the company (they are the admins of the Telegram group, and it is clearly indicated next to their name with the label \u201cadmin\u201d) or chat with other token buyers. Access to these groups is not filtered. Scammers masquerade as admins and contact you via personal message (PM) to send you their own wallet address with a request to send the money or coins for the token there. For example, they claim that the official wallet is down or that there is a special bonus if you use this wallet. They also ask you for your email address to send you fake emails later on, with the same type of requests/fake opportunities.\nWhat you should do: Use only the official wallet of the company to pay. These can always be found on the website of the company. There are usually no other wallets and there is also no bonus for using special wallets.\nBe careful with email requests, even if they seem to come from a company\u2019s email address. The sender address of an email can easily be faked (it\u2019s called \u201cemail spoofing\u201d). Never send your email address on Telegram in a PM, unless you are sure that you are using an official admin contact. You can recognize real administrators by the addition \u201cadmin\u201d next to the name. This addition is only visible in the group, but not in a private chat. You can only be sure that you\u2019re writing with a real admin when YOU contacted him (by clicking on their name in the group chat itself directly). Scammers use the profile photo of admins, the same display name and a similar username (for example, by using a capital \u201cI\u201d instead of a small \u201cL\u201d).\nSometimes, entire channels or groups on Telegram are faked. Do not fall for these fake channels! There is only one official Telegram group for every ICO. These real addresses can be found on the website of the ICO. All the others are fakes \u2013 stay away!\n\nGoogle / Facebook / Website\n\nScammers spare no effort: Some place paid ads on Google and Facebook, where they announce a real, ongoing ICO. However, these ads link to fake websites, most of which you can see in the endings of the links (.in, .pw, .id, etc.). If you buy something, your money is most likely lost, and if you even just log in, your password will be used to log in to the real ICO website and change the wallet address you want to have your tokens minted to.\nWhat you can do: Pay close attention to what the real website of the ICO you want to participate in is. Most of the time, it is a website with a .com ending \u2013 also check for the https \u2013 that is the sign for a secure connection.\nThere are still some other scams. If you are not sure, ask an admin of the company in the Telegram group. Be careful when identifying the company\u2019s real contacts, real channels and real websites. That is the basis to participate safely in an ICO.\nThe author of the article is\u00a0Tobias Zander, founder\u00a0and\u00a0CTO of Savedroid.", "category": "Guest Contributor"}

The new rules will specifically focus on investor protection, MAS Deputy Managing Director of Financial Supervision said in a speech released today.\nWhile the MAS doesn\u2019t regulate cryptocurrencies directly, the authority has mandated cryptocurrency intermediaries like exchanges and remittance operators to comply by anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFC) rules.\n\u201cVirtual currencies first emerged about 10 years ago.

As reported by CCN in October 2016, SBI became the first banking group to announce the launch of a cryptocurrency trading platform. SBI Virtual Currencies was established as a new offshoot in November 2016, but the launch of exchange operations continues to see delays. The delays come despite completing its registration as a virtual currency exchange operator with the Financial Services Agency, Japan\u2019s financial regulator, in late September 2017.\nThe group revealed that a select group of priority customers had already completed formalities to open an account at the platform but they, along with regular customers, will have to wait for an undetermined period of time for the launch of the trading platform.\nPointedly, SBI underlined the need for strengthening security measures as the reason for the delay.\nIn loosely translated statements, SBI said:\n\u201cWe decided that it will take a certain amount of time to further strengthen security measures, how to manage [customer] assets under custody, and customer management system.\u2019\nThe self-enforced delay notably comes on the heels of increased scrutiny by the FSA into cryptocurrency exchanges extending to on-site inspections by the regulator following the recent $530 theft from Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck.

The SEC apparently wants insight into the moving parts that comprise both the ICO and the pre-sale leading up to the public crowdsale.\nThe securities regulator has been ratcheting\u00a0up its talk on ICOs that it says may be in violation of securities laws, and now they are taking action. The BTC price was off about 3% soon in the moments after the WSJ report came out.\nICOs\u00a0are a multi-billion dollar market, with tallies for last year ranging from\u00a0$5.6 billion to as high as $6.5 billion. 2018 has been off to a bang as well, with deals such as Telegram targeting billions of dollars.\u00a0SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said earlier this month: \u201cI believe every token I\u2019ve seen is a security,\u201d which should have sent chills up the spine of the founders of blockchain startups that chose to label their tokens a utility and not a security.\nA utility token should have a specific application tied to the ecosystem for that token sale. For example, a gaming project whose tokens can be used to purchase virtual goods. But few \u201cutility\u201d tokens are actually limited to the applications they were meant for. When investors begin to speculate on the value of the token itself, that\u2019s where the gray area surfaces, which worries regulators.\nDeal Structure\nIn the subpoenas, the SEC is reportedly requesting information from issuers such as the \u201cstructure\u201d of both token sales and ICO pre-sales, according to the Journal. While both ICOs and initial public offerings (IPOs) are fundraising methods, the former is much more loosely regulated. ICO issuers disclose a white paper, comprised of details for how that project sees the world, and having to register with regulators would slow down the fundraising process.\nMeanwhile, cybersecurity consultant John Reed Stark, a former SEC official, presciently\u00a0told Bloomberg earlier this month that in addition to the ICO issuing companies, attorneys advising those startups that are found to be in violation of securities laws were similarly at risk of being part of a regulatory \u201csweep,\u201d one that he predicted would focus on the \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d to start.\nRegulators previously \u201crecommended enforcement actions against those that conduct initial coin offerings in\u00a0violation\u00a0of the federal\u00a0securities laws,\u201d according to the SEC.\u00a0The SEC last year made it the job of a new crypto-focused task force to examine new digital tokens that come to market, and they\u2019ve stopped or spooked more than a handful of them so far that they\u2019ve made public.", "category": "News"}

I don\u2019t think this is a good thing. The Governments ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. Right now crypto currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs and crypto currencies is super risky for those who go long.\u201d\nFalse argument 1: Anonymity is the main feature of cryptocurrencies \nAnonymity is definitely not the main feature of cryptocurrencies and for the past 9 years, bitcoin has been criticized for its poor privacy. Bitcoin is transparent, and its transactions are accessible on the blockchain network through blockchain explorers. In fact, many companies like Bitfury work with the government to untangle bitcoin transactions. \nThe existence of strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) systems on all major cryptocurrency exchanges also make it nearly impossible for hackers or criminals to steal funds in cryptocurrencies and cash them out to fiat money without triggering AML systems.\nAs MIT\u2019s Mike Orcutt wrote in a piece entitled \u201cCriminals Thought Bitcoin Was the Perfect Hiding Place, but They Thought Wrong,\u201d and as blockchain data analysis company Chainalysis co-founder Jonathan Levin emphasized, many cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum are not anonymous, and transparent by nature.\nFalse argument 2: Drug purchases with bitcoin caused deaths\nCriminals utilize all types of technologies to carry out criminal activities. Namely, cars, airplanes, fiat money, and even the Windows software. One can claim that Microsoft is responsible for bitcoin purchases and drug purchases with bitcoin given that the majority of bitcoin purchases are made on desktop, using the Microsoft Windows software.\nMore importantly, despite the growth of the dark web, the vast majority of drug purchases are made in fiat money like the US dollar. Research done by CNN in 2009 demonstrated that 90 percent of the US dollar had traces of cocaine. The US dollar or any other form of fiat money is popular amongst drug traffickers and distributors because fiat money is the true form of anonymous money, as cash cannot be traced.\nCCN reported that the US dollar is so overwhelmingly used in cocaine trade that physical traces of actual cocaine powder can be found on 90 percent of banknotes. \u201cWhen the machine gets contaminated, it transfers the cocaine to the other banknotes. These bills have fewer remnants of cocaine. Some of the dollars in his experiment had .006 micrograms, which is several thousands of times smaller than a single grain of sand,\u201d Yuegang Zuo, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth said.\nFalse argument 3: It is a Good Thing That Governmetns Find Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Money Laundering\nOleg Andreev, product architect at blockchain company Chain, stated that this argument is false because it requires the people to trust in the government to do the right, moral, and ethical thing with tax money, which isn\u2019t always the case. \nIt is not possible for the people, with absolute certainty, trust the government to not commit money laundering and money laundering when well regulated banks are busted on a regular basis for carrying out massive money laundering schemes.\n\u201cWrong. The governments\u2019 ability to do things rests on large-scale extortion. Governments themselves run giant money scams, extract nominal fees from banks that launder money, fund terrorists around the world and finance unimaginable range of guns and other sadistic devices such as prisons, public schools and DMVs,\u201d wrote Andreev.", "category": "News"}

According to the transcript of an interview, cryptocurrencies have been a hot topic for the firm with investors highly keen to learn more about them and the blockchain technology they utilize. Whilst the company recognizes the potential of blockchain technology, the firm is not surprisingly bearish regarding the fully decentralized currencies that currently exist.\n\u201cOur view is that while we like the concept of blockchain, and think it will evolve into a useful tool for companies, for the financial industry, we think cryptocurrencies in their current format, meaning that in the current incarnation, are in a bubble.\u201d\nShe went on to compare the current situation to a range of well-known bubbles, such as TOPIX in 1990, Nasdaq in 2000, and even to the tulip mania of the 1600s \u2013 describing cryptocurrencies as \u201castronomically\u201d more of a bubble.\nLater in the report however Mossavar-Rahmani seemingly contradicts this statement, acknowledging that cryptocurrencies in fact make up less than 1% of global GDP (today\u2019s total market caps $0.5t). To put it into perspective, Gold currently has an estimated marketcap of $8t, and the dotcom bubble of 2000 is estimated to have been $7t. To go one step further, we can look at the 2008 global financial crisis, caused by excessive risk taking by banking group Lehman Brothers and a hugely inflated housing market. Subprime mortgages of questionable value were sold at a huge premium \u2013 vastly inflating the market. When it crashed, $6t of investors money vanished with it.\nIt\u2019s also interesting to note that gold and housing investments are entirely speculative, whilst cryptocurrencies are beginning to offer real world functionality that will likely disrupt industries across the board \u2013 including the financial sector. This fact may be at the heart of the fear, uncertainty and doubt emanating from large financial institutions. Decentralized virtual currencies are not controllable, and big banks can\u2019t receive huge payouts from a federal reserve on a regular basis. Comments from Mossavar-Rahmani today certainly imply this:\n\u201cIs there room for a digital currency, maybe sponsored by one of the major central banks like the Federal Reserve? Yes. Could it be incredibly useful? Could it reduce transaction costs? Yes. But not these ones.\u201d\nHere \u201cthese ones\u201d refer to currencies uncontrollable by banking and governmental authorities. It\u2019s a clear sign that the financial industry is starting to grow worried regarding the development of cryptocurrencies that take away their economic power. It\u2019s an idea that builds upon revelations from earlier this week, were a memo from Goldman Sachs to the SEC was leaked stating that the institution \u201cmay be, or may become, exposed to risks related to distributed ledger technology\u201d. Goldman Sachs aren\u2019t the only institution growing worried, earlier this month it was revealed that Bank of America regards cryptocurrencies as a fundamental threat to their business model.\nCentralized financial institutions are right to fear cryptocurrencies. Currently they wield enormous power over global citizens, able to maximize profits in increasingly more dangerous financial games. When the bubble pops, sending the global economy crashing into years of decline, it\u2019s taxpayers who must step in and bail out the banks to the tune of trillions of dollars. With virtual currencies, centralized authorities become increasingly superfluous, as citizens become able to borrow, lend and invest on a decentralized trustless and low-fee global network.\nWhilst the rise of cryptocurrencies has certainly been meteoric and the current marketcap is still largely speculative, the notion that this is the largest economic bubble in history is a shame-faced attempt at spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt. It\u2019s a clear indication of a highly worried centralized system facing a future in which it has no place.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

The cryptocurrency market has existed for several years and their prices and popularity increased in 2017. The mining operation of cryptocurrencies are typically performed using specifically designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs); however, the introduction of new cryptocurrencies (e.g. Ethereum) have made mining on GPUs more efficient, providing a higher rate of return for the end user.\u201d\nAMD did not provide figures detailing the impact of cryptocurrency mining, but recently-released earnings reports reveal that may have been quite pronounced.\nAMD\u2019s share of the GPU market rose to 33.7 percent from 27.2 percent during the fourth quarter, while Nvidia\u2019s dropped 72.8 percent to 66.3 percent, which John Peddie Research attributed partially to the fact that AMD was the primary benefactor of the $776 million worth of GPUs that miners purchased in 2017.\nThis increased demand caused revenues to soar, but it did not come without its own difficulties. Chipmakers struggled to keep pace with demand, leading to production bottlenecks and skyrocketing prices on the secondary market. Inability to get their hands\u2019 on the latest chip models often left gamers livid, and\u00a0SETI researchers even complained that cryptocurrency miners were hindering the search for extraterrestrial life.\nMoreover, increased demand from cryptocurrency miners has presented AMD and \u2014 to a lesser extent \u2014 Nvidia with new business risks, as well. Demand from miners is less stable than gamers or other industries that utilize GPUs, which is likely why Nvidia has committed to favoring gamers over cryptocurrency miners when supplies are limited.\nConsequently, fluctuating cryptocurrency prices \u2014 as well as regulations hostile to the industry \u2014 could cause the GPU market to be \u201cmaterially adversely affected,\u201d though this would most likely affect AMD to a much greater degree than Nvidia.\n\u201cThe cryptocurrency market is unstable and demand could change quickly. For example, China and South Korea have recently instituted restrictions on cryptocurrency trading,\u201d AMD concluded. \u201cIf we are unable to manage the risks related to a decrease in the demand for cryptocurrency mining, our GPU business could be materially adversely affected.\u201d", "category": "Mining"}

It was seen as a significant move into more mainstream finance for cryptocurrencies.

Now that this has been completed, there is nothing standing in their way of a variety of instruments on the entire spectrum of cryptocurrencies.\nFirst Cryptocurrencies in Line?\nWhile Concannon did not go into detail about what cryptocurrencies CBOE would be focusing on initially, there has been a lot of speculation doing the rounds in the crypto community.\nBitcoin currently sits at the top of the crypto mountain with $178 billion worth being in circulation. There are an additional four digital currencies that exceed a market cap of $10 billion and they are Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.\nIt would make sense that one or more of these higher market cap tokens would be high on the list of priorities for a derivate launch by CBOE.\nThe Upgrades\nThere was significant work done on the CBOE Futures Exchange, including a latency reduction exceeding 80%. Transaction speed is extremely important for traders as a delay of even a couple seconds can have dramatic effects on the outcome of a trade.\nThey have also made improvements to the order-by-order data feed, bandwidth thresholds, self-trade prevention, risk controls and complex spread order handling.\nPeople are wondering if CBOE\u2019s competitor with bitcoin futures, CME Group will be following their lead and looking to launch futures for other cryptocurrencies. The CME Group seems to be taking a more cautious approach to expansion and will most likely watch to see what happens with CBOE\u2019s new offerings to see how they perform before making a firm decision.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The first ransomware strain to use the cryptocurrency, dubbed Thanatos, makes it impossible for users to decrypt their files, even after paying.\nPer Bleeping Computer, the ransomware was first discovered by cybersecurity researcher MalwareHunterTeam. After infecting a victim, Thanatos uses a new key for each file it encrypts, but doesn\u2019t store the keys anywhere. As a result, it\u2019s impossible for the ransomware\u2019s developer to decrypt a victim\u2019s files.\nThose affected by Thanatos are advised not to pay the ransom. According to researchers, the only way to get rid of it is by brute forcing the encryption key for each file, meaning victims should contact cybersecurity firms for help.\nThanatos is notably the first ransomware strain to accept Bitcoin Cash for payments, along with Bitcoin and Ethereum. After a user is infected, a readme.txt file opens up, telling them to send the equivalent of $200 to a BTC, ETH, or BCH wallet. Bleeping Computer\u2019s report reads:\n\u201cThis ransom note contains instructions to send a $200 USD ransom payment to one of the listed Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Bitcoin Cash addresses.

According to the company, its blockchain-based system keeps track of all relevant information regarding an imported shipment, including details about production, transport method, customs, inspection and third party verification.\nThe technical leader of the company, Tang Ren, told a Chinese news outlet,\n\u201cAlthough the concept of blockchain has only recently started to emerge, it has a very wide range of applications. We firmly believe that this is an Internet-based technology, not a tool for speculating on currencies.\u201d\nAs is typical for any blockchain-based system, once the data is recorded, it can be retrieved and scrutinized, but not modified under any circumstance. Blockchain\u2019s immutability is one of the primary reasons it has seen overwhelming use in cryptocurrencies. Thus, by extension, any system employing the technology can enjoy the security benefits and trustless nature.\nAlibaba\u2019s foray into blockchain technology does not necessarily indicate that the company has any soft spot for cryptocurrencies though. Not too long ago, in December 2017, the company\u2019s founder, Jack Ma, said that while he had no personal or business interest in the asset class at the time, his company was making significant headways in blockchain technology. Lynx\u2019s announcement is likely one of the few early results of Alibaba\u2019s foray into the field.\nGiven that Alibaba owns Taobao and AliExpress, two huge online shopping websites catering to China and the rest of the world respectively, it makes sense that the parent company is attempting to streamline its logistics process. Alongside the import business, Alibaba has also launched blockchain-based programs for the healthcare and food quality control industries.\nSome media reports indicate that Taobao\u2019s mobile app has been updated with links to \u201cView product logistics traceability information\u201d at the bottom of some items. When clicked, any information available for the product will be displayed, presumably allowing the user to ensure that the object in question has been imported from a legitimate source.\nSo far, it is estimated that over 30,000 imported goods from ports in Shangai, Shenzhen, Guangzhuo, Hangzhuo and Tianjin among others have had their details logged on the company\u2019s blockchain system.

A class action lawsuit was filed against San Francisco-based Coinbase in recent days in the US Court for the Northern District of California, claiming the leading US cryptocurrency exchange unlawfully kept cryptocurrencies that were sent by email and left unclaimed for years.\nPlaintiffs\u00a0 Timothy G. Faasse and Jeffrey Hansen are US residents and filed the complaint on behalf of themselves and others who are estimated to be in thousands, all of whom are being represented by Restis Law in San Diego.\nWilliam R. Restis of the law firm that bears his name told CCN:\n\u201cThese types of issues are simply growing pains for a maturing industry that is moving into the mainstream.

Both plaintiffs say they will use Coinbase if their bitcoins are restored.\nUnclaimed Bitcoin\nFaasse and Hansen allegedly missed out on 0.10 bitcoin and 0.01 bitcoin, respectively, that was sent in 2013. The BTC price mostly traded below $1,000 in 2013 until year-end, at which time it had a brief spurt trading above $1,000. The pair didn\u2019t claim their funds until this year amid a reminder but were met with a faulty link that wouldn\u2019t let them redeem the funds.\nAccording to the filing, Coinbase\u2019s egregious behavior is akin to a bank keeping funds from an uncashed cashier\u2019s check. In the case of Coinbase, users can send bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash by email, informing the recipient they are\u00a0getting the funds and providing a link\u00a0whereby they can create their own user account to redeem funds.\nUnfortunately, many of these emails went overlooked prior to the rise of cryptocurrencies in 2017.

The project\u2019s graphic designer, \u201cKevin Belanger,\u201d bears more than a passing resemblance to actor Ryan Gosling.\nMeet Kevin Belanger, who clearly missed his calling in life.\nNow it\u2019s possible that Mr. Belanger simply missed his calling in life as a Ryan Gosling body double/impersonator. However, developer Claus Wahlers did a bit more digging into Miroskii\u2019s team and found \u2014 unsurprisingly \u2014 that the remaining members are apparently fake as well. Most of the images are stock photos, while several were lifted straight from social media users\u2019 public profiles.\nThis discovery quickly made the rounds on social media. Likely realizing that the jig was up, the actual person or group behind the Miroskii ICO took the website offline, closed the project\u2019s social media accounts, and made off with their $833,000 worth of ill-gotten proceeds \u2014 assuming those self-reported figures are accurate.\nRed Flags Abound\nHowever, an archived version of the ICO\u2019s website reveals several other red flags that investors should have noticed.\nFirst, Miroskii \u2014 which describes itself as a \u201cBank without any Bankers\u201d \u2014 claimed that \u201cVisa, Master Card [sic], Maestro Card, American express [sic] and many more\u201d card issuers had signed on to issue Miroskii-branded cards. While cryptocurrency-funded debit cards do exist, they are currently only offered by a few companies, and it would not make sense that a startup would ink deals with three different card issuers. Moreover, this claim has been used to promote several other ICO scams, including PlexCoin.\nSecond, the website indicated that Miroskii Coin (MRC) was in the process \u201cto get regulated under the EUROPEAN [sic] Union.\u201d While it may be true that Miroskii\u2019s \u201cdecentralized bank\u201d would have been subject to EU regulations governing financial institutions, the project\u2019s creator clearly meant to intimate that the company would receive a banking license \u2014 a highly unlikely scenario.\nThird, Miroskii claimed that MRC had already been \u201ctested, approved and accepted by most of the industry giants who has [sic] already started using the MRC in their closed B2B sector.\u201d While perhaps technically true that MRC had been accepted by all of the companies that had started using the coin \u2014 i.e. zero companies \u2014 that is clearly not what the author meant to convey. Were MRC really being used by \u201cindustry giants,\u201d why had this not been reported in the mainstream press?\nFinally, the project creators were too lazy to even write a whitepaper, as a link on the ICO\u2019s website simply reads \u201cwhitepaper coming soon.\u201d If an ICO truly was in the process of applying for a banking license, had been pilot-tested by B2B industry giants, and had reached agreements to issue branded debit cards, one imagines that the project\u2019s developers would have found time to compose a whitepaper \u2014 or at least plagiarize one.", "category": "ICO News"}

Carney made his largely sanguine remarks on crypto virtually, seemingly on cue, March 2 before students at the inaugural Scottish Economics Conference, an audience who he pointed out may very well own bitcoin, ether or Scotland\u2019s digital currency Scotcoin.\nSpeaking on a topic he entitled \u201cTo Isolate, Regulate or Integrate,\u201d Carney decided that isolating society in a jurisdiction from cryptocurrencies could do more harm than good, pointing to China as an example of what not to do.\n\u201cIf widely adopted, however, isolation risks foregoing potentially major opportunities from the development of\u00a0the underlying payments technologies.\u201d\nChina was one of the most active countries in the space only to infamously ban exchanges, banks and payment providers from any crypto-related activity. Instead, Carney points to a \u201cbetter path,\u201d one that is comprised of regulation for components of the cryptocurrency market to fight fraud and support market integrity and security for the financial system at large.\nOn that note, he wants to hold cryptocurrencies \u201cto the same standard as the rest of the financial system,\u201d where there is a\u00a0higher privilege but also greater responsibility.\n\u201cA better path would be to regulate elements of the crypto-asset ecosystem to combat illicit activities, promote market integrity, and protect the safety and soundness of the financial system,\u201d he stated. \u201cThe time has come to hold the crypto-asset ecosystem to the same standards as the rest of the financial\nsystem. Being part of the financial system brings enormous privileges, but with them great responsibilities.\u201d\nEarly Innings\nHe discussed the\u00a0progress that has been made thus far, such as EU and US regulators holding cryptocurrency exchanges up to the same anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism protocols as the more highly regulated banks.\u00a0More work needs to be done, and regulators are grappling with issues such as how to classify cryptocurrencies to begin.\u00a0Carney suggests they\u00a0fall in the securities camp, and regulating them as such would be a step in the right direction.\nCarney got more specific, calling out initial coin offerings, or ICOs, for circumventing securities laws that are there to protect individual investors by relying on \u201csemantics.\u201d\nCarney believes that the US CME\u2019s and CBOE\u2019s launch of bitcoin futures has the potential to advance the crypto market toward a higher standard.\nCarney\u2019s remarks are timely, as they come ahead of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s report \u201con the financial stability implications of crypto-assets\u201d to the G20 summit to be held in Buenos Aires later this month.\nIn his remarks, Carney also took on the role of digital assets as a currency and a store of value. And while he doesn\u2019t expect\u00a0cryptocurrencies to replace fiat money anytime soon, he warned don\u2019t cramp their style.\n\u201cWhatever the merits of cryptocurrencies as money, authorities should be careful not to stifle innovations which could in\u00a0the future improve financial stability; support more innovative, efficient and reliable payment services as well\u00a0as have wider applications.\u201d\nCarney fittingly quoted American economist Hyman Minsky, saying, \u201cEveryone can create money; the problem is to get it accepted.\u201d Don\u2019t look now but cryptocurrencies appear to be doing just that.", "category": "Banking"}

He told Time\u2019s Money,\n\u201cCryptocurrency is very much here to stay [and] are going to displace roughly 25% of national currencies by 2030. They\u2019re just much more efficient, the way they run.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t say which ones, however.\nBitcoin is deemed both a digital currency and a store of value, and while it has made strides as a payment method it\u2019s still not an option at most US and UK e-commerce businesses or brick-and-mortar retail locations. That makes Frey\u2019s prediction that much more impressive.\nHe went on to discuss the International Monetary Foundation (IMF), pointing to remarks by managing director Christine Lagarde, who incidentally bemoans the amount of electricity that bitcoin mining commands. But Frey\u2019s point surrounds what the uncanny ability of bitcoin and the others to disrupt banks.\n\u201cWhen people like Christine Lagarde say cryptocurrencies could displace central banks and international banking, that\u2019s very significant,\u201d he noted.\nFrey, who is scheduled to address US Fed officials about cryptocurrencies later this year, equated bitcoin transactions to real estate deals. Instead of physical property, the seller is letting go of a \u201cdigital chunk\u2026 in the cloud.\u201d His categorization isn\u2019t too far removed from how the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) depicts cryptocurrencies as property, though bitcoin transactions aren\u2019t subject to the same tax benefits as real estate sales.\nFuturists make predictions about the future such as this pithy observation by Frey\u00a0 \u2013\n\n\"Our children's children, who haven't even been born yet, are counting on us to make great decisions!\" More at https://t.co/8VMF5sOepB pic.twitter.com/bG8tn2Ei6l\n\u2014 Thomas Frey (@ThomasFrey) March 1, 2018\n\n\u2018Legitimate Asset Class\u2019\nFrey wasn\u2019t the only futurist who weighed in on the future of cryptocurrencies and their role in the financial system.

Now seen as the \u2018Big Bitcoin Heist\u2019 by Icelandic media, the estimated value of the stolen equipment is nearly $2 million.\nAn ongoing investigation has already resulted in 11 arrests including a security guard for what is believed to be an organized crime leading to the biggest thefts ever seen in Iceland.\nPolice commissioner Olafur Helgi Kjartansson of Iceland\u2019s southwestern Reykjanes region where two of the burglaries took place said:\n\u201cThis is a grand theft of a scale unseen before.

A flurry of mining operations moving into the island nation has seen local politicians raise the possibility of taxing crypto mining activities.\nIcelandic police kept the heists under wraps until last month, reportedly in the hopes of catching the burglars.

The move places Tron as the fourteenth most valuable cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, with a total valuation surpassing $3.4b and overtaking Ethereum Classic.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the price increase followed the news that the virtual currency had been listed on the Bittrex exchange, with investors expecting that the move would increase exposure and adoption. Founder Justin Sun received over five thousand likes for his tweet responding to the exchange\u2019s announcement, which demonstrates the large community that the platform is building:\n\nThanks @BittrexExchange .

A blog post from the organisation based on a WeChat conversation with Tron\u2019s technical team revealed that the launch had been pushed forwards from July 1st to May 31st \u2013 an entire month. Developer Lucien Chen stated that the push forwards had been made possible by prioritizing what needed to be done for the launch and scheduling everything not essential to be implemented after the mainnet release.\nTron is not new to hugely volatile price swings.

Accusations were also made regarding the convenient timing of the announcement\u00a0 -which some say drew attention from the headlines that elements of the Tron whitepaper appeared to have been plagiarized.\nThe price of one Tron coin has stabilized at $0.052 at the time of writing.

Per the report, the cryptocurrency \u201cmay help the global currency system return to its basic value.\u201d\nWhile the agency doesn\u2019t assert whether the Petro can help Venezuela\u2019s economy, it points out the issuance of an oil-backed cryptocurrency is significant as it differentiates it from other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin that aren\u2019t backed by any assets.\nVenezuela\u2019s effort, the agency wrote, can \u201cgenerate useful lessons on how defects of the international currency system can be mended so that the system can return to its basic value.\u201d Being backed by the country\u2019s oil reserves means the Petro is protected from speculation and volatility, Dagong reports.\nThe report further points out that since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the international currency system has been dominated by the US dollar. The currency\u2019s credit foundation, Dagong continues, has been weakened by the country\u2019s \u201cissuance of currency in excess of its wealth creation ability.\u201d\nThe report reads:\n\u201cThe frequent occurrence of credit crisis is evidence of the inadequacy in the US dollar to effectively play the role of the international reserve currency. Under such circumstances, the innovation of petro may provide useful lessons for all countries to explore and experiment with new forms of currency backed by material wealth and good for cross-border payments and international financing.\u201d\nThe Bretton Woods Conference set up a system of fixed exchange rates based on the value of gold, created the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, and saw the US dollar become the international reserve currency. The system ended in 1971 under president Richard M. Nixon.\nDagong\u2019s report ends by stating that Petro\u2019s backup reserves aren\u2019t renewable. The cryptocurrency\u2019s success, as such, will depend on Venezuela\u2019s ability to create wealth. The report reads:\n\u201cA nation\u2019s incremental wealth creation ability is the key to its virtual currency\u2019s credibility. In the case of petro, it must rely for its sustainability on Venezuela\u2019s recovery in wealth creation ability. Once its issuer nation breaks away from restrains of its incremental wealth creation ability, the currency price will deviate from its value, and set the stage for a new credit crisis.\u201d\nDagong further revealed that it will be closely watching the Petro\u2019s developments. As covered by CCN, Petro\u2019s pre-sale is ongoing and, according to the country\u2019s leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, 171,000 companies and individuals registered to purchase the token.\nThe token sale reportedly netted $735 million in its first day, although no evidence was provided. Venezuela has since ordered state-owned companies to accept payments in the cryptocurrency, and announced a new cryptocurrency set to be backed by precious metals, the Petro Gold.\nSince the Petro pre-sale begun, other countries have revealed they\u2019re looking to issue their own cryptocurrencies. Among these are Iran, which recently backpedaled on bitcoin, Russia who\u2019s planning to launch a \u201cCryptoRuble,\u201d and Turkey.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

This also explains why cryptocurrency-friendly merchants still denominate items in fiat currency, as well as why many users currently prefer to \u201chodl\u201d than spend their coins.\nAnd while cryptocurrencies may not yet be an efficient payment mechanism, their utility in this regard will increase as scaling solutions such as the Lightning Network (LN) go live and more retailers adopt cryptocurrency payments \u2014 as most British small business owners expect will happen soon.\nNotably, however, Carney \u2014 in spite of his pointed criticisms \u2014 also acknowledged that cryptoassets have become a part of the mainstream financial system, which is why he argued that they should be held to the same regulatory standards as traditional assets.", "category": "Banking"}

But unlike bitcoin\u2019s 21 million, Eco set the cap\u00a0at 1 trillion to make it possible for \u201cbillions of users to own many Eco tokens,\u201d according to the white paper.\u00a0 Meanwhile,\u00a0on the website, they tout Eco as \u201cthe digital currency for everyone\u201d and provide what appears to be a wait list to get your share.\nEco is building a verified network of global universities, an approach that seems to take a digital page out of\u00a0 Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook. This network will \u201chelp build an evenly distributed and cooperative financial infrastructure\u201d in an energy-efficient way.\nEco isn\u2019t planning an initial coin offering to raise funds for the project, which is probably a good move in light of the recent crackdown by regulators, particularly the US SEC, on ICOs.\nCamp told Fortune a testnet could be operating within months.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The bill addresses both crowdfunding and cryptocurrency regulations, and puts Mexico among a small group of countries regulating the cryptocurrency space.\nAccording to Reuters, the bill seeks to \u201cpromote financial stability and prevent money laundering,\u201d and has been approved by Mexico\u2019s Senate back in December. Now, it only needs to be signed by the country\u2019s President Enrique Pena Nieto, to become law.\nReportedly, the bill was crafted in general terms, and will see regulators draft \u201csecondary laws\u201d that will help determine essential details for companies dealing with cryptocurrencies. The law will give fintech companies greater regulatory certainty surrounding issues such as cryptocurrency-related rules, payment methods, and crowdfunding.\nThe law will also permit \u201csharing of user information by financial institutions through public application programming interfaces (APIs). Francisco Mere, president of the association Fintech Mexico, stated:\n\u201cOpen banking recognizes that the information in the hands of the financial institutions is the property of the user, not the institution\u2019s, and that it can be brought to other financial intermediaries.\u201d\nFinancial institutions will, under the law, be able to use client information from large banks through APIs, as long as the users agree. Per legal news service JURIST, it will also mean that the country\u2019s central bank, Bank of Mexico, will be allowed to decide which cryptocurrencies the country\u2019s exchanges list. The exchanges will have one year to comply.\nCommenting on the bill, Mere stated that it will \u201callow better services, better costs and more inclusion.\u201d Some of the law\u2019s backers note that financial services will improve in the country, as new players will be able to compete with traditional banks.\nReuters further notes that the law was crafted in general terms.

We\u2019d love to be one of the first promotions in the world to have a whole bunch of cryptocurrencies associated with us,\u201d Iozzi said, adding that he has been in touch with several potential sponsors already.\nIozzi explained that MMA is a natural venue for cryptocurrency promoters to market their projects, as the industry\u2019s audience shares a similar demographic composition to cryptocurrency users.\nToward this end, Iozzi said that Primal FC plans to begin accepting cryptocurrency payments for event sponsorships and will also give fighters the option to get paid in cryptocurrency.\n\u201cThe athletes will get paid in crypto through [cryptocurrency-funded debit] cards, such as TenX for example, or directly to their cold wallets or e-wallets online so that the whole process\u201d will involve cryptocurrency, he said.\nThat would certainly set Primal FC apart from its competitors, but Iozzi said that this has been the promotion\u2019s plan since its inception.\n\u201cWe hold our events outdoors, in exotic locations \u2014 on the beach, in the jungle, in waterfall or river settings,\u201d he said, adding that every event is followed by a Full Moon-style party. \u00a0\u201cEvery other promotion is doing things in stadiums, so we\u2019re just trying to do something a little differently.\u201d\nBut while Primal FC may be the only MMA promotion actively courting cryptocurrency sponsorships, several fighters have inked deals with companies and promoters operating in the space.\nLast month, CCN interviewed Bellator MMA Welterweight Champion Rory MacDonald ahead of his title fight against former champion Douglas Lima.

If there was a $20 bill on the ground, somebody would have already picked it up.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an old joke, not exactly very funny, but it does illustrate how economists think. \u00a0Economists\u00a0have the luxury of making assumptions. \u00a0If the government decreases taxes, all things equal, people will spend more money. \u00a0Economists also create economic models. \u00a0These models are to make complicated ideas easier to understand. \u00a0The following is a simple economic model of cryptocurrency and the output it services. \u00a0There are lots of assumptions here and it\u2019s not supposed to be taken literally. \u00a0But it can give us an understanding of bitcoin\u2019s relationship in a complex, crypto-world.\nThe Equation of Exchange\nPreviously, I wrote about the equation of exchange here:\u00a0https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-quantity-theory-money-bitcoin-undervalued/\nEssentially, the equation of exchange is an economic equation that showcases the relationship between the money supply, the velocity of money, the price level and real output. The equation was derived by\u00a0John Stuart Mill 150 years ago and is a staple in any Macro or Monetary Theory class.\nMV=PQ\nM=money stock\nV=velocity of money\nP=the overall price level\nQ=real output.\nWe can first apply this to the US economy and apply some real-world numbers to this equation.\nPQ= Fourth quarter, nominal US GDP in 2017 was 19.73. \u00a0This is the 2017 price of goods and services produced within the country during 2017.\nNext, how much money is needed to service that GDP?\nM=According to the St. Louis Fred database, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2, we use 13.82 trillion dollars to service the 19.7 trillion dollars of output. \u00a0They are using M2. \u00a0Go way back to your college days and remember M1 is more or less cash and checking accounts and M2 is more or less your savings accounts. \nSince we have these numbers it\u2019s easy to find the velocity of money. Remember velocity is how fast money changes hands. We divide the nominal GDP, 19.7 by the money stock, 13.82. \u00a0This comes out to 1.42. \u00a0This is exactly what the St. Louis Feds\u2019 velocity number is as well. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V\nThat was easy. \u00a0Our US dollar equation of exchange looks like this:\nM(13.82) V(1.42)=PQ(19.7)\nApplying to Bitcoin\nOk, since we plugged in all the numbers with the dollar, let\u2019s do the same with bitcoin. \u00a0Now we need to define PQ in the bitcoin ecosystem. \u00a0Q is the real-world output that people purchase using bitcoin. \u00a0There are 2 identifiable groups of people who would derive utility out of using bitcoin: \u00a0those who want to get off the grid and those who want to get on the grid. Internet gamblers, people trying to send money abroad from economically unfree societies and a multiple of other people who use it for illegal activities.\nIn addition, there are people that have no access to the world financial system. These are people from war-torn countries like Afghanistan, Syria or Iraq or people in countries where the monetary and financial authorities have let them down, like Zimbabwe or Venezuela. \u00a0They will be allowed to get on the grid with use and access to bitcoin.\nPQ=Umm? Oops. \u00a0There is not a reliable number that can give us a PQ. The dark web and Zimbabwe are not exactly transparent with their financial numbers. \u00a0Being economists, we have to make assumptions here. \u00a0With all the hype and publicity of cryptocurrency lately, it\u2019s not absurd to assume that crypto could service 1% of world GDP in the next 3 years. \nAccording to Statista, https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/\u00a0world nominal GDP was 79.28 trillion dollars in 2017. \u00a0Now we have a number for our PQ, which is our nominal world GDP that crypto would service. \u00a01% of 79.28 trillion or 792 billion dollars.\nSo our equation now looks like this: MV=792 billion dollars. \u00a0Once again, the PQ (792 billion) represents the goods and services produced that are being purchased with cryptocurrency.\nNext is V. \u00a0This number is quite dark as well because we can\u2019t easily divide PQ by M. \u00a0According to Woodbull charts, bitcoin\u2019s velocity is 1.2. http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-velocity/\nThis doesn\u2019t seem too absurd. Bitcoin\u2019s velocity would be definitely lower than the dollar because it\u2019s being used as a store of value (M2) \u00a0more than a medium of exchange (M1). \nM*V(1.2)=792 billion\nSolving for M, we divide PQ by V. \u00a0PQ/V, or in napkin math, 792/1.2= 660 billion. \u00a0With this velocity and ratio, the world would need a crypto stock of 660 billion dollars to service 1% of world GDP.\nLet\u2019s switch out the M for C. C representing the world\u2019s crypto money stock. CV=PQ\nC(660 billion)V(1.2)=792 billion\nThe next step on our napkin would be to isolate bitcoin\u2019s share of the M stock. \u00a0According to coinmarketcap.com, \u00a0https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage\u00a0bitcoin\u2019s share of the crypto market is 40.8 percent. \u00a0This works out to a 269 billion dollar bitcoin money stock.\nBitcoin\u2019s Equation of Exchange\nOur final equation of exchange for bitcoin looks like this:\nB(269 billion) V(1.2)=PQ (322.8 billion)\n269 billion dollars of billion being spent 1.2 times will service a world nominal GDP of 322.8 billion.\nThe last step on the napkin is to figure out what each bitcoin is worth. \u00a0Presently, there are 17 million bitcoin out there (up to 4 million may be lost forever) with a cap of 21 million. \u00a0Let\u2019s use the 17 million. \u00a0269 billion/17 million bitcoins. \u00a0This comes out to $15,882 per each bitcoin. \u00a0This is not at all out of the range we have been in in the last 6 months.\nConclusion\nEconomists make assumptions and create models to simplify complex concepts and ideas. \u00a0According to this simple model, each bitcoin is worth $15,882, which is approximately 46% higher than current valuation. \u00a0This was not at all a literal take on the exact price of bitcoin but it can help us get an understanding of the relationship between crypto, bitcoin and the output that it services. \u00a0\u00a0Clearer numbers on V and PQ in the future will help us become more accurate at determining bitcoin\u2019s price and help us digest the complexity of this new asset class and money stock.\nWhich assumptions were right? \u00a0Which assumptions were wrong?

It\u2019s a trend that\u2019s pervasive throughout technology and Silicon Valley in particular. But blockchain, the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies, has the potential to be better, considering its mission is one tied to decentralization and a level playing field for all.\nIn some ways, however, women\u00a0have struggled to compete in a male-dominated culture whose fortress is reportedly\u00a0protected by cliques like the \u201cblockchain bros,\u201d according to a recent New York Times article.\u00a0The trend does not appear to be limited to startups, as evidenced by research suggesting women only represent between 4% and 6% of blockchain investors.\nWhile it\u2019s still early innings for blockchain, that makes this gender imbalance that much more concerning, as it\u2019s during the early days of an emerging market that new wealth is created and influencers born, setting in motion of chain of events ranging from investments to hiring behavior.\nThe Times article pointed to a Tweet by venture capitalist Alexia Bonatsos, saying \u2013\n\nWomen, consider crypto. Otherwise the men are going to get all the wealth, again.\n\u2014 Alexia Bonatsos (@alexia) January 25, 2018\n\nOn Wall Street, the gender gap recently came to the forefront with a bronze sculpture sponsored by asset management firm State Street in lower Manhattan, entitled \u201cFearless Girl.\u201d Meanwhile, in corporate America, big investors are putting more pressure on boards of directors for environmental, social and governance criteria, including gender equality.\nWhat Gives?\nSo what\u2019s keeping more women from diving into blockchain? Some suggest it\u2019s an inferiority complex, driven by the notion that you need a Ph.D. to succeed in the space, a misconception that one female crypto investor attempted to quash in the Times story. But it doesn\u2019t help when blockchain engineers are mistaken for models or whose qualifications are questioned, which has happened to women, including engineering students, pursuing careers in cryptocurrencies.\nAnd while women may feel excluded at some blockchain or cryptocurrency events, such as a recent bitcoin conference that held its networking session at a Miami strip club, it\u2019s not everywhere.\nMarket leaders have been tailoring conferences and events to draw more women to the blockchain space. It\u2019s working, as evidenced by sold-out events that are also attracting thousands to a live stream.\nGreen Shoots\nIndeed, there are also green shoots of gender diversity unfolding on the blockchain, suggesting it may depend on where you look. In an interview with Bloomberg, Digital Currency Group\u2019s Meltem Demirors described an industry in which the sands are beginning to shift.\nFor instance, she says the number of female\u00a0founders\u00a0among blockchain\u00a0startups is on the rise as well as the number of female investors across crypto vehicles such as hedge funds and venture capital.\u00a0Demirors admits, however, that \u201cthere\u2019s still some work that needs to be done in the ecosystem.\u201d\nIn the United States, men as of January still comprised nearly three-quarters of all bitcoin users, according to data cited in Bloomberg.", "category": "News"}

The fluidity and liquidity created by this concept helps to connect products and services while defying the restrictions of location and continually breaking the barriers of compatibility.\nWhat are Utility Tokens?\nA class of token that is growing in popularity and proving to be very essential within the blockchain ecosystem are \u2018Utility Tokens\u2019. These class of tokens primarily exist as accessibility elements on the blockchains that they represent. A more interesting concept about these tokens is the versatility that they offer by revolutionizing existing concepts, creating new ecosystems that empower the participants therein.\nThe CEO of Never Stop Marketing, Jeremy Epstein explains to CCN that Utility tokens confer a right on the holder to participate in the network in some way. Such tokens may give holders a right to use the network and take advantage of its services to vote on the governance of the network and its upgrade. For example, a decentralized Uber token might give you the right to take a ride whereas an ARK token gives you the right to vote on the direction of the protocol via its delegated proof-of-stake model (DPos). This is different than a security token where you earn income just by holding.\nSingle Ecosystem Entities\nApparently, the function of any particular utility token is determined by the solution offered by its parent blockchain. While Uber tokens give right to rides and ARK tokens enable voting eligibility as mentioned above, events planning and management blockchain startup KickCity offers utility tokens that will enable events platforms to plug unto the blockchain protocol. Imaging events platforms like Eventbrite, Ticketmaster and Meetup.com on the blockchain with a reward system that enables effective marketing. Such systems will permit event tickets to be sold beyond localized areas with a blockchain automated reward system to participants.\nAccording to the CEO of Sociall, Jade Mulholland, in comparisons to other major currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, utility tokens serve a very important purpose and commonly only exist within a single ecosystem. Mulholland elaborates that while Bitcoin serves as a form of payment or a store of value, utility tokens can usually only be used inside of a single platform to serve fundamental purposes such as making a purchase for a good or service.\n\u201cIn our project we have a utility token called SCL. Our token will be used as the native currency within the platform for purchases instead of traditional money (AUD, EUR, etc) or other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. SCL will not be used outside of Sociall. It will only exist within our platform\u201d, he says.\nFunctionality and Value\nWith blockchain technology there is a lot of versatility, and that is one of the key reasons why it finds adaptability in almost every aspect of human existence. No matter the specific purpose of a given token, be it for security, equity or utility purposes, it always plays a significant role in establishing the platform which it serves. Therefore in general, tokens can be appreciated as the lifeblood that sustains the parent blockchains.\nGalia Benartzi, Co-founder of Bancor explains how FINMA\u2019s recent opinion paper identified three types of tokens \u2013 asset, payment and utility tokens- while acknowledging the existence of hybrid models. According to Benartzi, at their core, utility tokens provide access to a specific application or service (which can be decentralized) or the right to contribute work within a community-owned network. Utility tokens can be staked, or locked under some terms, in order to gain privileges in an ecosystem, which creates strong incentives for users to behave.\n\nHe describes these tokens as the lifeblood of today\u2019s emerging online economies, motivating and mobilizing participants (including for-profit entities) to collectively provide an integrated set of solutions, while sharing the same database, user base and currency.\n\n\n\u201cSince online economies utilize their own unique utility tokens, economic growth means that participating businesses will see the value of their tokens increase as the network grows, enabling them to scale their operations, and profits, as well. This collective incentive and benefit structure is the essence of a functioning distributed model and the main driver of its network effect\u201d, says Benartzi.\n\n", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

His use of language on the official CFTC account, which can only be described as \u2018down with the kids\u2019, sets him apart from what most people would expect from a financial regulation official. It\u2019s fresh, funny, and we can\u2019t get enough of it.\nLike any good dad however, Giancarlo knows how to balance humor with sound advice. Earlier this month investors were warned to watch out for pump and dump scams and not blindly follow tips from social media or jump on sudden price spikes. Instead customers should:\n\u201cThoroughly research virtual currencies, digital coins, tokens, and the companies or entities behind them in order to separate hype from facts.\u201d\nThis was the message behind the humor of today\u2019s post too, with the tweet linking to a government document providing information for investors interested in virtual currencies.\nHaving a cryptocurrency enthusiast among the highest levels of regulators is a huge asset for developing blockchain technologies \u2013 and has to be a bullish sign for prices. Not only will Giancarlo fight our corner against strong regulations, his presence is promoting awareness and understanding. It\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see more institutional investors with deep pockets, as well as members of the public looking to get involved in crypto on the Chairman\u2019s recommendation. The concept of crypto as the technology of our future \u2013 a gift we must protect for our children, is a huge step away from what many still see as the criminal currency of the dark web.\nGiancarlo will serve until April 2019 and so we have at least another year of protection from the crypto dad. By that point cryptocurrencies will likely have developed immensely, possibly able to scale to mainstream adoption. The technology may be hugely more popular \u2013 socially accepted as a superior payment system.\nIf we get there, we may well look back and realize we have the crypto dad to thank for it. As a defender of the technology in its vulnerable infancy, Giancarlo could go down in crypto history. Here\u2019s to you, crypto dad!", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

Crooks hack servers, personal computers, and mobile devices and take advantage of the infected hosts\u2019 CPU or GPU to generate virtual coins without victims\u2019 awareness. Even botnets consisting of numerous zombie machines are now used to perpetrate illegal mining activity on a large scale rather than spew out spam or hit online services with DDoS attacks.\nThis malicious moneymaking vector got a boost with the emergence of in-browser mining scripts, such as Coinhive. The following incidents that took place recently illustrate how serious this issue is becoming and how booby-trapped website widgets play into threat actors\u2019 hands.\nBrowseAloud widget hack affects thousands of sites\nA massive cryptojacking wave took root on February 11, 2018, exploiting a popular widget called BrowseAloud. The malefactors were able to inject a surreptitious Monero miner into more than 4,200 Internet resources, including high-profile ones like the UK, U.S., and Australian government websites. In the aftermath of this compromise, the malicious script harnessed the processing power of visitors\u2019 machines to mine cryptocurrency behind the scenes.\nFor the record, BrowseAloud is a tool by Texthelp Ltd. designed to enhance website accessibility for broader audiences via speech, reading and translation features. By adding this widget to sites, webmasters make sure people with dyslexia, visual disorders and poor English skills can participate and use their services to the fullest. Furthermore, the software helps site owners comply with various legal obligations, so no wonder it is widely used across the world and has become hackers\u2019 target.\nAccording to security analysts\u2019 findings, the crooks somehow managed to compromise the JavaScript component of BrowseAloud utility and thus embed an obfuscated Coinhive in-browser miner code into numerous websites using this widget. Some of the notable victims include uscourts.gov, legislation.qld.gov.au, manchester.gov.uk, gmc-uk.gov, and nhsinform.scot. The total count of sites hosting the bad script reached 4,275.\nBy the way, the official site of the Texthelp vendor had the miner running on it as well. When the compromise was unveiled, the company temporarily took the widget offline to avoid further damage to customers. As of February 15, the breach was reportedly addressed and the service was up and running as usual.\nThe cryptojacking script was configured to consume visiting computers\u2019 CPU at 40%, probably in order not to get many red flags raised. The attackers\u2019 Coinhive wallet address is known, but as opposed to Bitcoin, the service does not allow viewing how much Monero its wallets hold. Therefore, the amount of cryptocurrency mined by the group behind the BrowseAloud hack remains a mystery.\nLiveHelpNow widget exploited for in-browser mining\nAnother cryptojacking campaign involving a site widget kicked off on Thanksgiving last year. In pursuit of easy gain, threat actors injected the Coinhive miner into one of the JavaScript modules of LiveHelpNow, a popular live chat widget. This widget is widely used by various e-commerce resources, including retail stores like Everlast and Crucial.\nThe stars aligned for the perpetrators in particular due to upcoming Black Friday and Cyber Monday, when numerous users go to online shops looking for best buys and other deals. Furthermore, it isn\u2019t likely that admins will be closely monitoring their sites for the malicious activity of that sort during the holiday spree.\nThe Coinhive script hidden in a trojanized copy of LiveHelpNow widget will cause the CPU usage of visiting computers to peak and stay at 100% during the Internet session. Interestingly, the miner was configured to run at random, that is, not all users who went to the compromised websites would join the covert mining rush immediately. In some cases, a page refresh was required for the rogue script to launch. The reason for this selective approach is, arguably, not to attract too much attention to the ongoing cryptojacking wave.\nAccording to source code search engine PublicWWW, the toxic \u2018lhnhelpouttab-current.min.js\u2019 script was running on more than 1,400 websites when this campaign took root. There are scarce details available about the source of the breach. This vacuum of evidence has spawned speculations about the hack being an inside job pulled off by one of LiveHelpNow employees. One way or another, it was a well-orchestrated compromise that must have brought the crooks a fair amount of Monero.\nHow to stay on the safe side\nThis is a nontrivial question. Cryptojacking is surreptitious by nature, so the only way for end users to spot this type of attack is to monitor their CPU usage \u2013 if it is constantly skyrocketing, that\u2019s a red flag. As far as the defenses go, here are a few tips that work proactively:\n\nInstall a browser extension that automatically blocks all known JavaScript miners. Some popular add-ons worth their salt include minerBlock and No Coin.\nMost adblockers may stop in-browser miners. But mind hackers use all possible ways to bypass adblockers.\nUse a reliable Internet security suite with an anti-cryptojacking feature on board.\nIt is recommended to use a reliable VPN service when connecting to unknown networks as crooks miners often go together with keyloggers and other malware.\nKeep your operating system up to date to make sure known vulnerabilities are patched and cybercrooks cannot exploit them to inject a miner imperceptibly.\n\nWebmasters should consider adopting the following combo of techniques to make sure their sites don\u2019t serve cryptojacking scripts beyond their awareness:\n\nSRI (Subresource Integrity) is a security mechanism verifying that the content loaded on sites has not been modified by a third party. Here\u2019s how it works. A website owner specifies a hash for a particular script. If this hash and the one provided by the corresponding Content Delivery Network don\u2019t match, the SRI feature automatically rejects the rogue script.\nCSP (Content Security Policy) is a security standard that makes it obligatory for all scripts on a website to have an SRI hash assigned to them. The fusion of SRI and CSP prevents compromised widgets from running on a website and thus stops unauthorized crypto-mining in its tracks.\n\nBottom line\nThere is nothing illegal about crypto-mining as such. It becomes a felony, though, when someone uses other people\u2019s computers to mine digital coins without their knowledge and consent. In-browser mining is a good way for website owners to monetize their traffic, but it is also a lure for criminals. As the BrowseAloud and LiveHelpNow incidents demonstrated, site widgets are low-hanging fruit that can be exploited for cryptojacking on a massive scale.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

On bitcoin, the politician suggested the government open its own bitcoin exchange(!).\nTurkey\u2019s former industry minister and deputy chair of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), Ahmet Kenan Tanrikulu, has reportedly drafted a \u2018detailed report\u2019 calling for the issuance of a state-controlled cryptocurrency. A \u201cnational bitcoin\u201d, the Al Monitor reports, called \u201cTurkcoin.\u201d\nThe politician said missing out on decentralized blockchain technology would mean a grave error on the government\u2019s part, stating:\n\u201cThe world is advancing toward a new digital system. Turkey should create its own digital system and currency before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\nDetails remain scarce as the 22-page draft has not seen a public release but the news report reveals the proposed Turkcoin would resemble asset-backed securities from Turkey\u2019s Wealth Fund that includes large public assets including Turkish Airlines, the Istanbul Stock Exchange, Turk Telekom, the National Lottery and the Ziraat Bank, among others. The politician argued reliance on public assets would bring low risk and volatility to the proposed cryptocurrency with profits higher than those offered by sovereign bond yields.\nThe proposal follows a noteworthy revelation by Turkey\u2019s deputy prime minister Mehmet Simsek on February 7, who said the government would begin work toward launching a national cryptocurrency. \u201cWe are planning to start our own work on digital currencies,\u201d the political official, who also sees Turkey\u2019s economy under his purview, said in an interview with CNNTurk. \u201cWe place high importance on digitalization.\u201d\nThe 22-page report also presented an overview on the current cryptocurrency space in Turkey, calling for attention on the unregulated space. The trading of cryptocurrencies and creating revenues through bitcoin mining aren\u2019t deemed criminal activity, Tanrikulu said in his report, calling for regulations at a time when \u201cmany enterprises accept payment in cryptocurrencies and the number of customers using those currencies is rapidly increasing.\u201d\nNotably, he went on to urge the government to install its own state-controlled bitcoin exchange.\nAn excerpt from the report read:\n\u201cThe introduction of encouraging regulations after assessing all kinds of risks would enable us to generate revenues from the cryptocurrency market, especially from bitcoin. In this context, the country needs a bitcoin bourse and legislation to regulate this realm.\u201d\nTurkey\u2019s foray into exploring and developing its own cryptocurrency follows similar efforts taking shape in a number of countries around the world. A notable example is that of Venezuela\u2019s \u2018petro\u2019, an oil-backed cryptocurrency pedaled by controversial Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro which recently netted $735 million in the first day of its token pre-sale.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

At present, Bitcoin is valued at $10,199 on Bitfinex, which represents a single-day increase of about 0.4 percent but a six percent increase from its intraday low of $9,583. Bitcoin now has a $174.1 billion market cap, which sets its market share at 38.5 percent.\nBitcoin Price Chart\nThe moderate recovery is potentially linked to the news that stock trading app Robinhood had begun rolling out its cryptocurrency trading service, which was first announced in January.\nThe service is currently only available to a limited number of users in five US states, but the company intends to quickly expand this in the coming months. Investors are largely bullish on the fact that most of Robinhood\u2019s 4 million registered users will soon have the ability to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum \u2014 with more cryptocurrencies likely to follow.\nEthereum Price Leads the Large Cap Index\nAlthough Bitcoin managed to recover back to a psychologically-important checkpoint, it was unable to advance much further. The Ethereum price, on the other hand, achieved an index-best six percent rally, raising its value to $867 on Bitfinex. Ethereum\u2019s market cap is now valued at $85.5 billion, placing its share of the index just a few points below 20 percent.\nEthereum Price Chart\nAltcoin Prices Post Mixed Advance\nThe remaining large-cap altcoins achieved a mixed advance, with most cryptocurrencies remaining close to the index.\n\nThe Ripple price and Bitcoin Cash price each rose two percent and are currently trading at $0.95 and $1,272, respectively.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d) received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) stating that Nasdaq had determined to delist the Company\u2019s securities under the discretionary authority granted to Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Rule 5101. The notification letter also stated that Nasdaq was revoking its prior notification to the Company that it had regained compliance with the market value of listed securities requirement of Rule 5550(b)(2) (the \u201cMVLS Rule\u201d).\u201d\nAs CCN reported, the company had rebranded as Long Blockchain in December, which led to a 300 percent surge in the firm\u2019s share price. This, coincidentally, raised the firm\u2019s market cap above the Nasdaq\u2019s minimum $35 million threshold and allowed the company to narrowly avoid being delisted.\nHowever, the subsequent cryptocurrency market downturn hit Long Blockchain and other cryptocurrency-branded firms hard, and the company\u2019s stock had plunged from $7 in December to below $3 by the end of January.\nThe stock slipped so far, in fact, that \u2014 now valued at just $30.5 million \u2014 Long Blockchain once again finds its place on the Nasdaq in jeopardy.\nThe document, which was signed by Long Blockchain CEO Philip Thomas, stated that the company planned to appeal the ruling, and, if the appeal is approved, the firm would have until April 9 to raise its market cap above $35 million for 10 consecutive days.\n\u201cIf the Company\u2019s appeal is approved, the Company will still need to regain compliance with the MVLS Rule by April 9, 2018.

Maduro\u2019s words came during the Petro pre-sale announcement. He also added that Venezuelans will be able to pay for fuel and tourism services in cryptocurrencies, including the Petro. As covered by CCN, cryptocurrencies are popular in the country, as they help citizens survive government failures.\nThe Petro was created as a way for the country to bypass US sanctions. The cryptocurrency\u2019s pre-sale is currently ongoing, and according to Maduro the country\u2019s government netted $735 million in its first day, although he didn\u2019t back his claim with any evidence. Shortly after the cryptocurrency was announced back in December, Venezuela\u2019s opposition-run congress criticized its sale, as an \u201cillegal and unconstitutional\u201d instrument to mortgage the country\u2019s oil reserves. Yet, merely one day after launching the Petro\u2019s pre-sale, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced another cryptocurrency, the Petro Gold. While the first is backed by oil, the Petro Gold is set to be backed by precious metals. On a televised speech, Maduro stated:\n\u201cNext week I\u2018m going to launch the petro gold, backed by gold, which is even more powerful, that will strengthen the petro.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t clear if the Venezuelan president referred to the gold reserves in the central bank, or to an undeveloped mineral deposit. Seemingly following Venezuela\u2019s footsteps, other countries are now looking into launching their own cryptocurrencies. As covered by CCN, Iran recently backpedaled on bitcoin, and is now planning its own state cryptocurrency. A Turkish politician has also endorsed the idea of a national cryptocurrency, the Turkcoin.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

However, it could prove popular among cryptocurrency enthusiasts as adoption continues to increase.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the bill will garner enough support to pass the legislature, as other similar bills have failed in the past in other states across the country. Two years ago, for instance, Bitcoin-friendly New Hampshire voted down a bill that would have made it the first state to accept Bitcoin tax payments.\nNotably, though, Georgia is not the only US state currently considering whether to make cryptocurrencies a valid payment method for state taxes.\nAs CCN reported, Arizona has the jump on accepting Bitcoin tax payments. SB 1091, which includes similar language to Georgia\u2019s bill, passed the Arizona Senate 16 to 13 earlier this month and is currently working its way through the legislative process in the state\u2019s House of Representatives.\nMeanwhile, Wyoming \u2014 a state that does not have income taxes \u2014 is on the cusp of approving a measure that would exempt cryptocurrency holdings from the state\u2019s property tax, effectively equating it to other forms of money, which have always been exempt from property tax obligations.", "category": "Bitcoin Progress"}

Beijing-based Bitmain, which came on the scene in 2013, generated between $3 billion and $4 billion in operating profits last year, according to Bernstein data cited in CNBC. California-based chipmaker Nvidia, meanwhile, which boasts a market cap of $147 billion, delivered an operating profit of $3 billion in 2017.\nBitcoin mining operations are comprised of computer networks that perform calculations and are rewarded in bitcoin for the equations they solve, thereby fueling the network. Bitmain generates revenue by a combination of selling mining equipment and running bitcoin mining pools, where multiple miners join forces for greater scale.\nConsidering Nvidia\u2019s role to provide semiconductors to machines used for bitcoin mining, the combined performance is reflective of a bitcoin mining industry that has shown no signs of slowing down despite China\u2019s best efforts.\nBernstein\u2019s profit estimates for Bitmain are based on a gross margin and operating margin of 75% and 65%, respectively. While Bitmain certainly benefited from last year\u2019s astronomical rise in the bitcoin price, it also takes a very strategic approach. \u201cBitmain shrewdly adjusts the prices of miners according to bitcoin prices,\u201d according to the Bernstein report.\nThat\u2019s how they\u2019re able to achieve such as margins, considering that as the bitcoin price soared, so too did Bitmain\u2019s\u00a0AntMiner S9, while production costs plateaued.\nAccording to Bernstein, Bitmain controls as much as 80% of \u201cbitcoin miners and application specific integrated circuits (ASICs.)\u201d The analyst firm forecasts that Bitmain\u2019s dominance will persist in 2018, but it\u2019s challenging to make predictions beyond that given the uncertainty surrounding the cryptocurrency market and the BTC price.\nBitmain key revenue generating channels are highlighted in gray in the Bernstein report.\n\nDiversifying Away From China\nWhen China began cracking down on cryptocurrencies including bitcoin mining facilities, Bitmain unveiled an astute expansion into a more friendly jurisdiction for the market, Switzerland. In fact, it\u2019s moving its hub right into the heart of Crypto Valley in Zug.\nThey\u2019ve diversified their business operations even further by also setting up shop in Israel, Canada and Singapore over the past year.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia, the company compared to Bitmain in the analyst report, is also benefiting from the demand for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin miners use the graphics chips made by Nvidia or AMD, for instance, to fuel their operations. Gaming is still their core market, but cryptocurrencies are increasingly\u00a0playing a role.\nYahoo Finance\nNvidia\u2019s stock price has risen alongside the demand for cryptocurrencies over the past couple of years, though the company has been clandestine about the percentage of its revenues that originate from the cryptocurrency market. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia execs shared that cryptocurrency-driven revenue was higher on a sequential basis.", "category": "Bitcoin Companies"}

There is a massive influx of products and projects that promise various solutions to regular day to day activities. As with every new technology, numerous ideas with diverse intentions are bound to flood the ecosystem, but the line between sustenance and extinction lies at the point of real use case application.\nAs the industry grows, it is expected to mature into the era of implementation. In order for this to happen, there must be means by which the communication gap between non-crypto users and the ecosystem will be bridged. For instance, the whole concept of Bitcoin transaction is still a mystery to a lot of people who do not understand how a long series of codes can represent key components of value transfer. Same goes to non-tech people who do not understand how data can be stored on a system that is maintained by nodes that are connected across the globe.\nThe Main Reason Behind Slow Crypto Adoption\nAccording to Dr. Yassin Hankir, Savedroid founder and CEO, the crypto world is totally strange to many who have grown up without any knowledge about Bitcoin, wallets, coins, e.t.c. Hankir elaborates that the incredible hype around Bitcoin has significantly increased the awareness and attracted so much attention towards the technology. But he decries the effect of this knowledge gap, noting that it is the creation of user interfaces that can enable the regular population understand crypto investment like a simple savings account.\n\u201cCryptocurrencies are awesome. There is just one problem: high adoption barriers. Starting from registering at an exchange, over selecting a wallet, to handling private keys it is a cumbersome process. I am convinced that a groundbreaking simplification is required to bring crypto to the masses. Cryptocurrencies can have a bright future as we see a continuously growing number of real life use cases. Combined with a fundamentally simplified user experience this will lay the grounds for mass market adoption, and that is what we are working on with the Savedroid\u201d, he says.\nRather than anonymity, the main reason why most people are reluctant in involving themselves with crypto transactions is because of the complex outlook that it presents. For instance, something as basic as a wallet address is represented with a long series of codes that is difficult to memorize. Such conditions restrict the flexibility processes, thereby making it inconvenient for most intending users.\nWhat Everyone Needs to Know About Crypto\nThe CTO of Avesta, Jan Van Melle notes that in order to create mass adoption, a given technology needs to have a real use case, should be easy to use, be safe and offer some form of benefit.\nMelle explains that technology does not necessarily need to be \u201cunderstood\u201d to become mass adopted.\n\u201cThe same as mobile phone, no one knows how the technology really works. But everyone uses it. Modifying the front end and making it more user friendly will go a long way in encouraging the adoption of blockchain technology. For instance, instead of having a series of codes as identifiers, individual wallets can be represented by more simplified account numbers. This will retain the anonymous nature of the technology while improving compatibility\u201d, he says.\nThis same opinion is upheld by Christopher Franko, CEO of Borderless Corp. Having acknowledged Blockchain to be an awesome technology that gives users the ability to remove intermediaries and increase the amount of trust when it comes to transacting value. Franko notes that the technology in its current state is hard to understand and hard to use, hence the need for user interfaces that will bridge the existing gap.\nHe continues by elaborating that we need to get to a point where people are using the technology without having to understand how it works. For instance, people use TCP/IP and HTTP everyday and do not understand how those protocols work. Same with credit and debit cards. So in order to bridge the gap, there is the need to make the technology so easy to use that people don\u2019t even realize they are using it.\nEducation Is Fundamental\nTo be fair with innovation and its stages of development, there\u2019s always a steep learning curve with such fundamentally new technology as blockchain. Founder of Helium, Jason Cassidy notes that we must consider that when it comes to financial innovation that it has lagged behind most of the other major sectors badly due to lack of impetus and competition. Now, cryptographically secure currency via blockchain implementation is raising that bar very quickly, and the innovation is not contained simply to the realm of traditional finance either.\nCassidy elaborates that we will need to see considerably more education-based initiatives across the globe. \u201cI am a big proponent of education as it is the only true way to build a foundation to start with the new paradigm of blockchain\u201d, he says. On top of that, he notes that we will need to eventually weed out the true innovators in the industry from the ever-growing list of self proclaimed \u201cexperts\u201d. These people arguable do more damage than they do to help, and the only reason this is possible is due to how early on we are.\n\u201cTen years from today the playing field will be levelled and you need something of substance to backup such a claim as being an expert in an extremely complex and relatively new industry. As long as we put education first, time will take care of the rest as this technology is not going anywhere. To give context, we are still in the bottom of the first inning in a nine inning baseball game that may very well go into extra innings before all is said and done\u201d, concludes Cassidy.", "category": "Blockchain News"}

This is in fact the most debated issue amongst community experts. My own view splits scalability improvement into 3 categories:\n\nBefore we dive into each point, one must first understand how networks work and interact. It\u2019s definitely a quite complex subject (of which I\u2019m no expert), that requires constant monetarization and testing. What we really need to focus on is to try understanding how blockchain developers and bitcoin community members may improve the network, in order to make it faster without compromising security and resilience.\nHow does innovation happen at the blockchain level?\nThe blockchain is a dumb network, much like most distributed ledgers. This means innovation happens at the edges (so at the users level) and not at the center (usually promoted by the company that \u201cowns\u201d the network).\nThink of Facebook. If you\u2019re a developer and thought of a really nice improvement to their code, which would allow for way faster communication between users, could you just submit it as an improvement proposal? Maybe, but the likelihood of being accepted by the network owner, Facebook, would be quite limited. On the other hand, if Facebook was just a dumb network, it would mean that users could submit updates and the overall community would agree upon which to implement (like BIPs). It\u2019s of the upmost importance to grasp this difference, as all scalability solutions I mention below follow the second open-source approach:\n\nIncreasing the Blocksize (BCH);\nRemoving Transaction Data (Segwit);\nAccepting Off-chain layer solutions (LN).\n\nSolution A: Increasing the blockchain\u2019s blocksize\nThis proposal has probably been the most discussed since bitcoin came to existence. It seems obvious why: the fastest way to increase transaction output is to increase the block size. It means each block would incorporate more transactions. For example, this was the approach taken by Bitcoin Cash (BCH).\n\n\nThe good: with increased block size, each block would contain more transactions, hence increasing throughput, meaning faster transaction times.\nThe bad: with increased bock size comes increased space requirements. So if you happen to have the entire blockchain on your machine, the space needed to store it would increase. Full nodes would definitely be way more expensive to own and operate!\n\nFees could also increase in the long-run, as miners would need an extra incentive to produce each block. Now imagine how high they can go assuming:\n\nThe reward for each block continues to decrease;\nThe heavier each block gets the more fees users need to pay to compensate miners for the extra transactions added and for the spacing requirements.\n\nSolution B: Removing transaction data\nIf you can\u2019t bring Mohammed to the mountain, you bring the mountain to Mohammed.\nThat\u2019s exactly what this solution does: instead of adding to the block size, like previously explained, what Segregated Witnessing (or SegWit) does is to take out transaction data information from each block, meaning each block will fit more transactions as each transaction has less data.\nSimple, right?\nEssentially new storage space is created in Bitcoin\u2019s blocks, which is not subject to the 1MB size limit but rather a separate 0.7MB limit as witness data, or transaction information about inputs and outputs, is moved to this new storage space.\nAre miners supporting segwit?\n\u00a0\n\nAs you can see, the majority hasn\u2019t still adopted Segwit, as it\u2019s quite a new technology and due to the many issues faced by the SegWit2x team.\n\nThe good: the obvious advantage of segwit is how it can enable faster transactions among peers. It also enables lightning transactions (discussed below).\nThe bad: there are two different problems, in my personal view, with segwit being widely used. (1) The fact that witness data is removed from the transaction means the transaction is less secure. By definition, if you have less information on your piece of data, it becomes easier to crack. (2) It becomes more expensive to run a full-node, as more transactions can fit into a block.\n\nI personally share Andrea\u2019s view on the matter, as it becomes obvious segwit implementation was a step needed, at least in order to implement the lighting network. There\u2019s a really nice cost/benefit analysis here.\nSolution C: Accepting Off-chain layer solutions\nThe Linghting Network (or LN), has been regarded as the holy grail of layer two solutions for Bitcoin. The LN incorporates an off-chain ledger, meaning, transactions can be sent between peers, not on the blockchain itself, but on a second off-chain layer.\nThis is: settlements between addresses get updated on the blockchain, while the rest of the transactions stays on the LN layer.\nRight, but has it been widely adopted?\n\nAlthough LN is still on the testnet only, some adventurous folk have already started to use it for delicious payments.\n\nThe good: transactions happen incredibly faster and there isn\u2019t the risk to clog the network. It seems the LN is the main door to B2B and B2C payments, as it will allow for off-chain peer transactions.\nThe bad: the LN may decrease transparency, as not all transactions get to the blockchain, only final transactions (account balances), and it mandates that users have money on channels to keep them open between hubs.\n\nMany people say bitcoin\u2019s problems will be fixed by Segregated Witnessing and the Lightning Network \u00a0being implemented, but I do have my doubts. Not that I do not think for a second both technologies won\u2019t improve bitcoin\u2019s transaction times. But, alone, they won\u2019t be enough to get bitcoin where we need it to be (closer to visa and paypal transaction times).\nWhy do you think Segwit and the LN won\u2019t fix bitcoin scalability issues?\nFor starters it\u2019s still too early to discuss mass adoption. For example, SegWit has been implemented since August 2017, but hasn\u2019t been adopted worldwide. In the case of the LN the issue is a bit different as the technology itself might not work as expected.\nMore importantly, what can we learn from history?\n\nThe internet could not scale, because the intranet was too slow for pictures; afterwards, the internet could not scale because the intranet was too slow for video files; finally, the internet couldn\u2019t scale because there was no way infrastructure would support dealing with the amount of data, required by millions of people across the globe.\nAnd guess what happened?\nConclusion: the scalability problem isn\u2019t really a problem. Bitcoin could scale already, by sacrificing the distributed nature of the blockchain, although that would defeat its purpose.\nThe next time you consider investing in the upcoming Bitcoin killer app, ask yourself:\nCan you identify any cryptocurrency with a similar adoption to bitcoin and not the same scalability problems?\u00a0\nBe patient. Use the force. Think.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Authorities also raided his home and office, according to a report from Reuters.\nThe arrest is notable given that since Latvia is a member of the eurozone, Rimsevics holds a seat on the ECB governing council. In fact, he has served longer on the council than any other central banking chief.\nRimsevics\u2019 detention follows an order from the US Treasury, which last week instructed domestic banks not to transact with Latvia banking giant ABLV, claiming that the firm has \u201cinstitutionalized money laundering\u201d under Rimsevics\u2019 watch.\nRimsevics, meanwhile, reportedly plans to continue his work at the bank, despite calls from legislators that he be suspended during the investigation.\n\u2018Institutionalized Money Laundering\u2019 or Not, Banks Continue to Finger Bitcoin as the Problem\nThe ECB, incidentally, has expressed open hostility toward Bitcoin, which several members have lambasted as a fraudulent asset or money laundering scheme.\nWhile ECB President Mario Draghi has frequently stated that the organization does not have the authority to regulate cryptocurrency, individual members have been less measured in their comments on Bitcoin.\nEwald Nowotny, who leads Austria\u2019s central bank and also sits on the ECB governing council, suggested last year that regulators should follow China\u2019s example and pursue a broad crackdown on cryptocurrency trading.\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking ourselves if legislators or central banks should intervene, as happened in China where they banned (the use of cryptocurrencies) because they consider them fraudulent,\u201d he said.\nMore recently, ECB executive board member Yves Mersch said that the board\u2019s views on the nascent technology were in line with those of noted Bitcoin basher Agustin Carstens, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).\nLast month, Carstens excoriated Bitcoin in a recent speech, arguing that there is a \u201cstrong case\u201d for central bankers to \u201cclam[p] down\u201d on the cryptocurrency, whose only use case is \u201cillicit or illegal transactions.\u201d\n\u201cNovel technology is not the same as better technology or better economics,\u201d Carstens added. \u201cThat is clearly the case with Bitcoin: while perhaps intended as an alternative payment system with no government involvement, it has become a combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster.\u201d\nPerhaps the central bankers should remove the planks in their own eyes before they presume to subject Bitcoin to the same treatment.", "category": "Banking"}

The lack of implementation of the technology was increasingly frustrating for Coinbase users, who launched a petition\u00a0calling for the exchange platform to prioritize SegWit implementation over other upgrades. The petition noted that the Bitcoin community is \u201coverwhelmingly in support\u201d of SegWit, and was signed over twelve-thousand times.\nSegregated Witness or SegWit was a major improvement to the Bitcoin protocol. By redefining the structure of blocks, (with one block changing from 1MB to become four million units) it became possible to greatly reduce the space taken on the blockchain by transaction and witness data. The change allowed more transactions to be stored in each block, making the blockchain more efficient and cheaper to use.\nCoinbase is not alone in recently adopting the technology. Last week the Bitcoin Core wallet upgraded to allow SegWit Transactions, which was followed by an announcement from Bitfinex that they too were now utilizing SegWit on Bitcoin transactions. Bitfinex were clear of the advantages of the protocol upgrade, stating in their blog post:\n\u201cWe are delighted that through this implementation we can provide our customers with bitcoin withdrawal fees that are up to 20 percent lower, as well as faster-than-ever transaction speeds.\u201d\nCoinbase were not so jubilant regarding the upgrade, but they did offer a clear warning to users not to confuse Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash deposit addresses. This is because following the change to SegWit the exchange is no longer able to retrieve funds.\n\u201cWhile SegWit should help reduce fees, once we begin rolling out this change,\u00a0if you incorrectly send Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to a Bitcoin (BTC) address, your funds will not be recoverable.\u00a0Sending the incorrect digital assets to a deposit address will result in permanent loss.\u00a0\u201c\nWith Coinbase adopting SegWit it is expected there will be a significant increase in the speed o the Bitcoin network, as the exchange represents a huge proportion of transactions. Sergej Kotliar, CEO of mobile top-up service Bitrefill, noted that the number of unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions plummeted at the same time that Coinbase was experiencing an outage, which suggests that Coinbase transactions were a heavy load on the network. The veracity of this claim has not been confirmed, but many are welcoming Coinbase\u2019s adoption of SegWit regardless, hoping for both a faster and cheaper service.\n\nAnother view.

Meanwhile, CHIT, a construction and real estate development company, also revealed its plans for an upcoming ICO in which it planned to issue the SJT coin \u201cfor financial and societal gain,\u201d all of which made its way onto the radar of the SEC.\nThe companies are considered penny stocks and trade in the OTC market.

Bitcoin has fallen below the $10,000 mark again, while Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency Ether has struggled to spike above $900.\nBitcoin\nEarlier this year, the dominance index of bitcoin reached an all-time low at around 32 percent. Throughout the recovery period in February, the dominance index of bitcoin, which measures its dominance over the global cryptocurrency market, rose significantly, to around 39 percent, as most cryptocurrencies in the market followed the price trend of bitcoin.\nWhile bitcoin has performed better than Ethereum, tokens, and other major cryptocurrencies in the market in the past month given that it has increased by nearly two-fold since dipping to $6,100, it has been extremely volatile. \n\nAfter the initial bear cycle and slump in January, analysts expected the price of bitcoin to start recovering to its previous levels by late February. But, bitcoin has continued to move in between the $9,500 and $11,000 range, without major buy volumes or rallies to push its price to $12,00 and potentially to early January levels in the $14,000 to $15,000 range.\nMany traders have expressed their concerns over the short-term performance of bitcoin, primarily because of its low volume and the sudden spike in the daily trading volume of Tether, a US dollar-backed cryptocurrency, which traders on major cryptocurrency trading platforms like Binance use to hedge the value of major cryptocurrencies.\nAdam Back, a bitcoin expert and the CEO at blockchain development company Blockstream, noted that while technical analysis may demonstrate a highly volatile future for bitcoin, technical developments and fundamentals point toward an optimistic future for bitcoin.\n\u201cSounds like chartism/tea-leaves over fundamentals: tech investment, scaling progress, infrastructure development pace & ecosystem collaboration, institutional financial products, retail investment products, all at all-time high.

Generally, markets lead to efficiency. \u00a0Market failures are situations where the market does not provide for an efficient result. \u00a0People making decisions in their own self-interest, under these circumstances, make things worse for the masses. \u00a0The fight over what is a market failure and the government\u2019s response is the crux of economic and political debate. \u00a0\nGenerally, proponents of big government identify, label and argue for more government intervention to fix these failures. Education, healthcare, inequality, and housing are areas where the debate over market failure are intense. \u00a0Libertarians and other small government proponents feel government intervention just makes the problem worse. \u00a0Consequently, they label these situations government failures. \u00a0Governmental failures create massive misallocation, more central planning and other inefficiencies that create a huge market for lobbyists and rent-seekers. \u00a0The historical track record of central planners making economic decisions in the aggregate is very poor.\nMarket Failures\nEven Libertarians and other small government proponents would admit that markets do fail and a little government intervention is necessary to remedy true market failures. Economists have identified a few common market failures. They include monopolies, externalities, asymmetric information and public goods. \u00a0These failures justify some type of intervention.\nMonopolies \u2013 A monopolist is a producer who is the sole supplier of a good without a close substitute. Monopolists have the ability to raise the market price above equilibrium price where there is competition. \u00a0\u00a0Consequently, they can reduce output of a good and increase scarcity. \u00a0Monopolists must be protected by some sort of barrier to entry.\nAsymmetric Information \u2013 This situation occurs when one side of a transaction has more information than the other. \u00a0Usually, this involves the seller having more information than the buyer. \u00a0What really is in that medicine? \u00a0How much revenue does that business actually produce? \u00a0What is in that food? \u00a0Food labeling laws, restaurant inspections, FDA approval, and the SEC are examples where the government has created laws to head off this sort of market failure.\nNegative Externalities \u2013 Negative externalities are situations that arise from an economic activity that effects unrelated parties. \u00a0Pollution is a classic example of a negative externality. Consumers and producers, acting in their own self-interest, create pollution which is harmful and destructive to everyone. \u00a0\nNon-Excludable Public Goods \u2013 \u00a0The free market does a horrible job providing public goods that are non-excludable and nonrival. \u00a0Non-excludable means that one cannot be excluded from using the good or service. \u00a0Because one cannot be excluded from enjoying the benefits of the good, many people choose not to pay and become free riders. \u00a0With so many free riders, beneficial public goods won\u2019t be created. \u00a0National defense, dams, and lighthouses are examples of public goods. \u00a0The free market alone has a hard time raising money for these projects. \u00a0Government is needed to raise the money for their construction and, in theory, everyone is better off once they are built.\nBlockchain on Monopoly and Asymmetric Information\nThis is a simple brainstorm of how blockchain could help cure traditional market failures. This could help lead to more freedom, more efficiency, less scarcity and a more productive allocation of resources. \u00a0Entire academic papers could be written on each of these topics. \u00a0Once again, blockchain is a decentralized, tamper-proof ledger.\nMonopoly \u2013 Generally, monopolies are created through regulation. \u00a0Natural monopolies are very rare and some economists say they don\u2019t exist. \u00a0Essentially, monopolies need a moat, or a barrier to entry to protect them from competition. \u00a0Cable companies, telecommunications, railroads and taxi cartels are examples of government-created monopolies. \u00a0Because blockchain can circumvent regulation, government created monopolies will feel pressure with this new technology. Think Uber-like destruction in all government-created monopolies.\nAsymmetric Information \u2013 When the seller of a product has more information that the buyer, they can take advantage of the buyer. \u00a0Blockchain can verify. \u00a0Blockchain can prove. \u00a0Where and when did this meat originate? How much does this medical procedure cost? \u00a0Why does it cost so much? \u00a0What are the true revenues of this company and what is the history of this used car? \u00a0What is in this drug and what are the verifiable results of people who have taken it? \u00a0Blockchain can clearly help even the score between buyers and sellers. \u00a0Markets could become more efficient. Less licensing will be needed and barriers to entry will be reduced. \u00a0More people of all socioeconomic classes could start businesses easier. \u00a0Prices can become more transparent. Life-saving drugs will be approved faster. Insurance pools will be more transparent and providers could be held more accountable. \u00a0\nBlockchain on Externalities and Public Goods\nNegative Externalities \u2013 Many economists feel negative externalities result from situations where there is no market. \u00a0They also usually occur where property rights are very weak. \u00a0The air and ocean are good examples. \u00a0It\u2019s easy to dump pollutants into the air when property rights are so weak. \u00a0Blockchain will help create markets in places with weak property rights. \u00a0Think Cap and Trade. \u00a0What is the optimal level of pollution in the air? \u00a0Environmentalists could buy clean air credits and polluters would finally have to pay a price for creating negative externalities on common resources. \u00a0Remember the tragedy of the commons? \u00a0Imagine each cow and the pasture being recorded and priced with blockchain contracts.\nNon-Excludable Public Goods \u2013 Groupon meets the Hoover Dam. \u00a0Bureaucratic allocation of public goods and bridges to nowhere will decrease. \u00a0Blockchain contracts will create public projects with more consumer choice. \u00a0The more people join together on public goods, the cheaper the per person contribution will be. Unnecessary, bloated, corrupt projects will not happen. \u00a0There could be lots of radical breakthroughs here leading to more efficiency with an increase in consumer and producer surplus.\nConclusions\nMarkets generally supply goods and services the most efficient way possible. \u00a0Blockchain will slowly shine a light on the inefficiency of many government solutions to market failures. \u00a0Economists and public policy analysts have barely scratched the surface of how blockchain can offer solutions to traditional market failures. \u00a0Blockchain has the potential to increase choice. \u00a0Consumers will make decisions based on their preferences. \u00a0This will push out our production possibility curve, allowing us to do more with less, lessening the burden of scarcity and fight against rent-seeking. \u00a0Additionally, it can reduce central planning and the misallocation of resources that accompany it. The traditional way of corrupt, inefficient, and expensive government solutions to these failures now will have competition. \u00a0In free societies, logic, efficiency, and productivity usually win. I\u2019m betting on blockchain.", "category": "Blockchain News"}

The token sale raised over $100 million USD in a mere 12 hours.\nThe ICO was intended to fund the future development of the proposed tZERO tokens and a security token trading system and platform. The vision of the team behind tZERO is to create a crypto-solution for \u2018security token liquidity\u2019 that is in compliance with securities laws. tZERO hopes to leverage its accumulated knowledge in securities trading and technology \u2013 including blockchain technology \u2013 to develop a platform that can be used worldwide, allowing investors to trade both traditional and emerging types of securities. Their aim is to \u2018democratize, expand and strengthen capital markets\u2019.\n\nThe tZERO whitepaper begins with a discussion about the emergence of Initial Coin Offerings as an alternative to IPOs or venture capital funding when seeking investment. It then addresses some of the many concerns facing ICOs today. tZERO points out that despite the advantages ICOs have over more traditional paths to accessing investor funding, the token-based style of financing presents risks to investors and challenges for regulators.\nICOs, tZERO argues, tend to be based on the 3 W\u2019s: a website, a whitepaper, and a wallet address. Its ICO is based on the 3 P\u2019s: the people, the product, and the plan. Their whitepaper asserts that a focus on elements that are fundamental to a company\u2019s likelihood of success raises the bar for ICOs.\nSecondly, tZERO seeks to meet US securities law requirements. In July of 2017, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued the so-called \u2018DAO Report\u2019, the \u2018Report of Investigation\nPursuant to Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The DAO\u2019. In it, the SEC determined that the Howey Test should be applied in deciding whether tokens offered during an ICO were to be defined as securities, and therefore subject to state and federal securities regulations.\nAccording to the Howey Test, an investment instrument subject to securities regulation is \u201ca contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.\u201d The test case for the SEC was the ethereum-based The DAO project. While the SEC did not seek to prosecute the developers of the project, it was determined that tokens sold in an ICO were to be considered securities.\nAs a result, some ICOs issue so-called \u2018utility\u2019 tokens, which are services or units of services that can be purchased. As such, they would seem to fall outside the definition of a security, especially if, as is usually the case, they afford the investor no rights or equity in the company. \nIncreasingly, ICOs are prohibiting US citizens from participating in their fundraising campaigns. This is a strategy to eliminate the risk of falling under SEC jurisdiction and being subject to US state and federal securities regulations, which are notoriously onerous.\ntZERO recognizes that regulation is inevitable. The company claims to be the first it is aware of to issue preferred stock security tokens, in accordance with applicable US state and federal securities laws.\nDespite this, fine print in their whitepaper states that \u201ctZERO Tokens when offered and sold will not be registered under the US Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), the securities laws of any state, or any other jurisdiction, nor is such registration contemplated. tZERO Tokens will be offered and sold pursuant to one or more exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable jurisdiction\u201d. From a potential investor\u2019s perspective, then, it might be useful to view the ICO as being conducted in accordance with US securities regulations, whereas the tokens themselves will not be securities.\ntZERO\u2019s whitepaper describes a rather unique hybrid token, offering the best features of traditional securities, (with all the accompanying rights and protections afforded them), along with the benefits and utility of the tokens commonly issued in an ICO.\ntZERO boasts an ICO that is based on the 3 P\u2019s of the people, the product, and the plan. Let\u2019s examine these one-by-one.\nThe People\nThe team behind tZERO comprises:\nPatrick M. Byrne is the CEO and founder of overstock.com. Overstock was the first major online retailer to accept bitcoin as a payment method, and in 2016 became the first company to issue shares of a public company on a blockchain.\nJoe Cammarata is the President of tZERO and has a storied history of bringing innovation to trading markets. He remains the CEO of agency brokerage firm SpeedRoute, also owned by overstock.com and part of the tZERO umbrella. SpeedRoute became a highly successful firm under Joe\u2019s guidance and specializes in routing US equity market orders.\nRalph Daiuto is tZERO\u2019s COO & General Counsel. Ralph boasts over two decades of experience in overseeing legal, compliance, and regulatory governance in the securities and technology industries.\nJohn Gilchrist is the CIO of tZERO and brings to the company thirty years of experience in managing and developing technologies in the securities and exchange sector.\nThe core team is supported by a technology team that is well-positioned to empower tZERO with technological advantages in the securities and trading sectors, and a brokerage team that understands the complexities of the securities regulatory environment in the US capital markets and how to remain within compliance with regulatory guidelines.\nWith an ensemble of highly successful entrepreneurs, experienced blockchain developers,\nseasoned brokerage executives, and fintech experts, tZERO appears suitably equipped to achieve its vision to \u201crevolutionize capital markets through blockchain technology\u201d. The group maintains a core belief in \u201cinnovation, market disruption, and collaboration.\u201d\nProducts\nSomewhat uncommon for an ICO, tZERO already boasts a suite of operating products and assets in its portfolio. Let\u2019s take a look at these, as outlined in their whitepaper.\nDigital Locate Receipt (DLR) Software\nDLR software works to prevent naked short selling in the market by recording all transactions electronically, on a blockchain. This automated system of performing transactions is designed to eliminate pricing and allocation inefficiencies that arise from naked short selling (selling stock that has not previously been, or cannot be, borrowed by the trader).\n\nSpeedRoute Execution Services\nSpeedRoute, a subsidiary of tZERO, has a vast network of brokerage clients and uses smart order routing solutions to execute equities orders. It is anticipated that tZERO will build on SpeedRoute\u2019s technology and platform to incorporate token trading capabilities.\nBlue Ocean\nBlue Ocean is an overnight trading platform for U.S. equities, using its Alternative Trading System (ATS) to allow traders to trade securities outside of traditional market hours. Its goal is to revolutionize and modernize capital markets, and reduce the inefficiencies created by restricted trading hours.\nDiscounted Retail Trading through Siebert Financial Corp.\nSiebert Financial Corp. and tZERO signed a letter of intent to provide discounted online trading of US equities to tZERO customers. It is expected that traders who subscribe to this service would benefit not only from discounted brokerage services, but also from SpeedRoute\u2019s smart order routing and execution services.\nRobo Advising through tZERO Advisors\nAutomated trading is a fast-growing industry, and tZERO plans to launch this service in 2018, offering highly competitive rates. tZERO asserts that overstock.com\u2019s enormous customer base will be a target market for this service.\ntZERO\u2019s Trading Platform and Planned Token Trading System\nEstablishing an enhanced tZERO platform is the principle goal of tZERO. The platform has been operational since 2016, when it began offering trades of Overstock\u2019s Blockchain Voting Series A Preferred Stock (OSTKP). It executes trades using blockchain technology. The company plans to scale up the platform to be capable of trading security tokens (tokens or coins defined as securities under US securities laws). The company acknowledges the immense challenges they face in scaling up their platform to be able to handle security tokens. They do not expect the tZERO platform to be utilized in the same manner for the trading of security tokens as it currently is for OSTKP. Below is an image of the eZERO platform in operation in the trading of OSTKP.\n\nEnd-to-End Trading Ecosystem\ntZERO operates an expansive end-to-end trading ecosystem, which includes SpeedRoute\u2019s 15c-3-5 compliant risk management tools, tZERO\u2019s web-based and desktop order entry mechanism, and a range of monitoring tools.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThe tZERO platform incorporates an Order Management System (OMS), which has executed \u201ctens of millions of orders on a daily basis with near 100% uptime for the last 7 years\u201d. It also utilizes a Smart Order Router (SOR), which can break orders up to be routed to different market centers, implement dynamic order routing to access the most competitive market prices, and execute various automated safeguards for traders to minimize risk. SORs have become increasingly important in US capital markets, as market centers expand to include more exchanges and dark pools.\nThese technologies form the backbone of tZERO\u2019s strengths in the marketplace. The company is uniquely positioned to be able to pivot to provide solutions for the use of blockchain technology for trading in both traditional capital markets and emerging asset classes.\ntZERO\u2019s whitepaper outlines a compelling case for tZERO\u2019s potential in the sector. Using blockchain technology, tZERO\u2019s goal is to \u201ctransform capital markets by making them more transparent, liquid, and accessible\u201d.\n\ntZERO is led by a credentialed team and driven by a vision to utilize the benefits of blockchain technology in capital markets, connecting entrepreneurs and investors with efficiency and transparency. It is a company with the lofty goal of being at the forefront of the intertwining of the fintech and blockchain industries, applying regulatory rigor in anticipation of a changing regulatory environment.", "category": "ICO News"}

From Edward Murrow to The Snowden investigation, incisive investigatory journalism has brought down governments, agencies, politicians and laws.\nHowever, in a changing landscape, the global community has become more fractured, fragmented and disparate. As #FAKENEWS becomes an epithet of anything one disagrees with \u2013 regardless of fact \u2013 we are fast moving towards a post-truth world.\nThere is an experience that has infected the cryptocurrency landscape. It is called \u201cFUD\u201d. It literally means Fear Uncertainty Doubt. It is a catch-all phrase that is applied to media articles one dislikes.\nThe \u201cFUD\u201d moniker can be seen in the comments section on this very website. One can look further afield among the myriad of cryptocurrency news sites and find similar usage among the public commentariat.\nWhy does it matter?\nHaving a pejorative term applied liberally to any article that denotes, in the readers\u2019 mind, a negative connection between the content and the crypto landscape creates a problem for both readers and news providers.\nThis creates a problematic inference, one that sees negative news simply as \u2018FUD\u2019 and therein fake news. This creates a problem. News websites rely on readership which in turn are funded by online advertising. If a website publishes content that is deemed too \u201cFUD\u201d and asks inconvenient questions to the powerful; how can such journalism fund itself in a quagmire of propaganda?\nThere is a sense that those peddling the \u201cFUD\u201d attacks simply want positive news, day after day, to help nurture their own insecurities. Propaganda isn\u2019t the alternative. Propaganda isn\u2019t news. It is information without objectivity used to influence people to further an agenda.\nCalling out \u201cFUD\u201d for what it really is!\nCryptocurrency news journalism should attack the \u201cFUD\u201d movement for what it is. It is a fear that inquisitive journalism could result in the torch of journalistic truth illuminating the poor behavior of an unregulated, decentralised, anonymous crypto elite who fear to be uncloaked.\nThose peddling \u201cFUD\u201d, and attacking articles with any negative sentiment as a wholesale attack on cryptocurrencies, fail to understand the importance of such analysis and investigation. Right now, Twitter accounts are peddling fake news to trick unsuspecting investors. Right now, Telegram groups are convening to organize the next \u201cPump and Dump\u201d crypto event. Right now, in all probability, an exchange is in trouble and is covering this experience up.\nIt is right that these experiences are highlighted. It is correct that the cryptocurrency news community becomes a bastion of truth shielding those who want free, fair and impartial news against the alternative \u2013 propaganda.\nCryptocurrency Deserves Trusted Journalism\nCryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology underpinning it will transform society in the twenty-first century. No one can doubt this. However, there is a necessity for good journalism to shine in order to hold those in power to account.\nGood cryptocurrency journalism is about trust, it is about being non-biased, it is about integrity, it is about understanding balance and finally reporting in an honest way. To become a reporter for CCN, candidates are requested to sign an ethical statement outlining their own obligations. Other news sites do the same.\nThe average cryptocurrency investor must have trust in truth over \u201cFUD\u201d. We must move beyond clickbait, persecution and doxing, misquoting, misrepresenting positions and facts. Facts are facts. The post-truth doctrine is a fallacy. We must follow the standard norms of good journalism and the cryptocurrency public will need to mature to understand the importance of this change.\nHonest and trustworthy cryptocurrency journalism is the cryptocurrency sector\u2019s own cultural conscience. It might be painful, it might challenge your beliefs, it might make your blood boil will anger, but journalists have a right to shine the journalistic light of truth on misdeeds and tell the wider world about inequalities \u2013 the cryptocurrency landscape isn\u2019t exempt from this ideal.", "category": "News"}

For more information and statistics on crypto, ATMs check out more from CoinATMRadar.\nCoinFlip\nCoinflip was founded in December of 2015. The company operates cryptocurrency ATMs that allow buying and selling of Bitcoin, Litecoin,\u00a0and Ethererum all in one terminal.\u00a0The rate charged at all CoinFlip\u2019s ATMs is 6.9% above GDAX (Coinbase) spot price for buys, and 3.5% below for sells. The industry average buy rate is 8.86% based on 1,402 operational crypto ATMs. Buy and sell percentages are higher than using an online exchange, but the advantage is it is instant and in cash. For many online exchanges, there is a long lag period (usually days until the funds are in place) when buying with an ACH transfer from a bank.\nCCN: What is Coinflip\u2019s main goal?\nBenjamin Weiss: We try to bring a physical aspect to something that is very abstract to people and that is why the ATMs have been such a big success so far. We have machines in over seven states currently with future national expansion and plan to be in many more places in a short time.\nCCN: When did you form CoinFlip?\nBW: December 2015 is when the company started and I would say it has really taken off since 2016.\nCCN: Who is your primary user demographic?\nBW: The demographics which are using the ATMs are crazy! It runs the gambit: from people who don\u2019t have bank accounts and are using Bitcoin as their primary bank account, to people who are sending remittances to Mexico and other countries\u2014because it is cheaper than traditional wire transfer services\u2014to people high net-worth individuals who don\u2019t want to buy Bitcoin from their computers and would rather just get it easily with cash by going to an ATM. Therefore, the spectrum is full, from one end to the other of the different demographics that are using the ATMs. There is no \u201caverage\u201d user, it\u2019s all over the map.\nBenjamin Weiss of CoinFlip\nCCN: Besides buying Bitcoin, you can also make withdrawals? Essentially selling Bitcoin and taking the cash.\nBW: Yes, on certain ATMs there is the sell option. However, it is so early in the game that most of the transactions we have are buys and not sells. But the number of people cashing out now is getting higher because crypto prices have increased. I think as the market matures and as the market develops, you are going to see an even ratio of buying and selling.\nCCN: Your ATMs are unique because they are, from what I have seen, the first ones to offer withdrawals. Can you elaborate on this feature?\nBW: At the time, it is really rare to see the selling feature on Bitcoin ATMs, but as the price keeps going up, our strategy going forward is to keep working on the withdrawals capabilities to make sure people have that option to cash out.\nCCN: Can you elaborate on the sell feature? How are you able to do it?\nBW: It\u2019s a more expensive operational model. We add features such as cash recyclers, in order to prevent having to go and restock the ATMs with cash. Sure, it\u2019s a bit hard from an execution perspective but it\u2019s something that can be done. We are continuing to develop this feature.\nCCN: Have you had a problem where someone is trying to take out a very large sum of cash?\nBW: Due to compliance and regulations with federal laws, we have a $7,500 cap on withdrawals. We handle hundreds of thousands of dollars in online and wire transfers, but most people would not be comfortable with taking out that much cash. And of course, we have taken these and other measures to protect against money laundering. To go above and beyond the minimum regulations, we have added more security such as with transactions over $3,000, which require a social security number (SSN), source of funds, purpose of funds, and we run software that can validate the SSNs so fake ones cannot be accepted. However, we would never let users type in their SSNs into an ATM, this is done one time, over the phone with our customer support team.\nCCN: So, you need to have an account to use the ATM?\nBW: No, if the amount is more than $700 then you need to swipe your ID and we run a check to ensure you are not a sanctioned individual and you are allowed to use the financial institutions of the United States. You only need to register and this step is to prevent money laundering.\nCCN: Which currencies can you buy at your ATMs?\nBW: Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. We are working on adding other coins, but I can\u2019t say which.\nCCN: What is your outlook on Cryptocurrency?\nBW: Very positive. That\u2019s why we have created these ATMs to make it easy for the average person to buy it. For the average person, it can be a challenge to buy cryptocurrency. There is this amazing financial technological revolution going on and we want to ensure everyone can take part; we want an ATM on every corner. We are motivated by bringing cryptocurrency to everyone.\nAlso, the use of crypto varies country to country. For example, in the U.S. Bitcoin is more of an asset or store of value, but in Venezuela, where the currency has been totally debased, Bitcoin is a life-saving payment system. Remittances are big for us, because it\u2019s cheaper, faster, and more efficient.\u00a0 With the implementation of the Lightning network the fees have come down, around $2.00 now and the transactions are much faster than they were a few months ago.\n\nCCN: Bitcoin Cash was poised to take over based on speed and costs a few months ago, but now after SegWit and Lightning, what are your thoughts on Bitcoin\u2019s longevity?\nBW: It\u2019s here to stay. Period. I could see Bitcoin at $100,000. I mean it\u2019s so early in the game. I am a huge believer in it long term. It\u2019s hard to have a serious investment portfolio that doesn\u2019t include Bitcoin.\nCCN: What are your thoughts on the Illinois Blockchain Initiative? The state agencies want to create a better, more secure system of record keeping.", "category": "Banking"}

Half a million people have applied for Liberland citizenship.\nLiberland\u2019s territory, however, remains in dispute, as Croatia claims to own the 2.5 square miles of uninhabited marshland next to the Danube River that extends 7 kilometers between Croatia and Serbia.\nThe land\u2019s borders were redrawn at the end of the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s, at which time it switched from Serbia to Croatia. Croatia, however, did not want the land since it would have had to accept new borders giving it less territory. Serbia wanted the new borders since it got more territory.\nFor different reasons, both Serbia and Croatia said they did not want the land.\nLiberland Proclaims Its Statehood\nVit Jedlicka, a former economist, said he wanted the land, and in 2015, he and three friends planted a flag there and elected him as president.\nWhile Croatia did not want the area, it did not want a libertarian state with gun-toting residents on its border. Croatia said it would arrest and fine anyone who attempted to enter the area. Jedlicka was fined when he tried to enter Liberland from Croatia. About 100 people have been arrested since the dispute began in 2015.\nJedlicka has since signed up close to half a million citizens online and has appointed ambassadors-in-waiting and a cabinet. He said Liberland\u2019s case has been taken to a Croatian court and he is awaiting a ruling.\nNo Mandatory Taxes Or Gun Control\nLiberland initially planned to have bitcoin as its currency and have no mandatory taxes or gun control.\nJedlicka has raised funds from rich libertarians and through crowdfunding. He has also printed passports. The country conducts its business via email and Skype. It has 100 lawmakers living in different countries.\nThe country will launch its own blockchain based legal system and will ensure citizenship via digital contracts. Liberland plans to issue its own coin, called Merit, on April 13, which will mark the country\u2019s third anniversary. All taxpayers will receive Merit, which will effectively grant them a stake in the country.\nThe government budget is distributed in around a dozen cryptocurrencies.\nJedlicka said he worked for years to lower taxes and regulations in the Czech Republic before realizing it was easier to start a new country than trying to fix an existing one,\u00a0according to The Telegraph.\nHe said he worked for a few years as a financial markets analyst, which gave him a good understanding of the system Liberland is using.\nJedlicka Fights On\nJedlicka has spent three years traveling to 100 different countries to gather representatives for Liberland.\nHe travels to different countries and is looking for citizens from different continents, including Central America, South America and Africa.\nLiberland has won the attention of business leaders who worry their companies will be hurt by European laws.\nRoger Ver, an early bitcoin investor, has shown an interest in Liberland. Patrik Schumacher, chief executive at Zaha Hadid Architects, has submitted artwork for Liberland\u2019s future cityscape. Jeffrey Tucker, an American economics writer and bitcoin supporter, Dan Mitchell, a Cato Institute fellow, and Richard Sulik, a Slovakian politician, have all endorsed Liberland.\nJedlicka said Liberland has a local community and infrastructure on the Serbian side of the river that welcomes visitors.", "category": "Accepts Bitcoin"}

The 20,000 returned tokens are in addition to 10,000 ETH reverted back to CoinDash previously in September.\nAs reported by CCN at the time, the perpetrator hijacked CoinDash\u2019s website during its token sale event before replacing the company\u2019s ethereum donations address with his or her own. Over 2,100 transactions took place with investors channeling funds to the hacker\u2019s address. According to Etherscan, the hacker still has a balance of 13,000 ETH.

The Bitcoin price was the day\u2019s headliner, soaring 10 percent to threaten the $11,000 threshold, but a number of other cryptocurrencies posted strong showings as well.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nThe bullish pivot enabled the cryptocurrency market cap to climb to $461 billion, representing a 24-hour increase of seven percent.\nBitcoin Price Rises in Wake of Poloniex Acquisition\nThe Bitcoin price outperformed the index on Tuesday, rising 10 percent to $10,716 on Bitfinex. This represented a five-day high for the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin now has a $181.7 billion market cap, which translates into a 39.4 percent market share.\nBitcoin Price Chart\nThe Bitcoin price rally correlated with the announcement that fintech startup Circle had acquired cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex in a deal reportedly worth $400 million. In addition to ranking among the largest acquisitions in the industry\u2019s history, the acquisition also increases the exposure of cryptocurrency-skeptics such as Goldman Sachs to the industry\u2019s supply chain, as the investment banking giant was one of Circle\u2019s earliest investors.\nWhile it is not clear to what extent the acquisition factored in the market\u2019s single-day advance, the move clearly represents a step forward in making cryptocurrency-related investments palatable to mainstream firms.\nEthereum Price Tests $900\nThe Ethereum price lagged the index on Tuesday but still managed to return a two percent increase to $882. At one point, Ethereum made a run at the $900 barrier, but the second-largest cryptocurrency ran out of steam at $895 and subsequently ebbed to its present level. Ethereum currently has an $86.6 billion market cap, leaving it with an 18.8 percent share of the index.\nEthereum Price Chart\nAltcoins Advance, But Litecoin Gets Left Behind\nLarge-cap altcoins made a near-comprehensive advance on Tuesday, but there was one notable cryptocurrency \u2014 Litecoin \u2014 that sat out the rally.\nAltcoin Price Chart\nThe Ripple price rose four percent for the day, lagging the index but climbing back to $0.93. Bitcoin Cash, meanwhile, made an eight percent advance, raising its price to $1,272 and market cap to $21.6 billion.\nLitecoin, ranked fifth, was the lone top 10-cryptocurrency to fall against the dollar. The Litecoin price declined by three percent, reducing it to a present value of $219.\nNEO, on the other hand, nearly doubled the index return with a 13 percent surge. NEO is now valued above $140, providing the token with a $9.1 billion market cap.\nEOS was the only other top 10-altcoin to beat the index, rising eight percent to $8.39, while Cardano, Stellar, and IOTA rounded out the market\u2019s top tier with gains of about four percent.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

This could help the firm drive traffic between its subsidiaries, which the firm has gradually been rebranding under the \u201cRakuten\u201d label.\n\u201cBasically, our concept is to recreate the network of retailers and merchants,\u201d Mikitani said. \u201cWe do not want to disconnect [them from their customers] but function as a catalyst. That is our philosophy, how to empower society not just provide more convenience.\u201d\nAs CCN reported, Rakuten acquired Bitcoin payment processing startup Bitnet in 2016 and tapped its leadership to run a blockchain research lab. This new program is likely a product of that acquisition. Previously, Rakuten had contracted with Bitnet to accept Bitcoin payments, making it one of the earlier e-commerce platforms to embrace cryptocurrency.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The reasons were not unintentional \u2013 prior to the study, another one was conducted last month where 57% of 2,000 Americans admitted that they profited from cryptocurrency gains. Considering how 2017 was a roller coaster ride for crypto users, many people have gained a large sum of money by either shorting virtual currencies or selling them when the price broke records.\nEven before the study, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had been tightening its hold around cryptocurrencies, warning people to pay their taxes on time. Last year, IRS won a court case against online exchange Coinbase to hand over information of 140,000 Coinbase users. These users were filtered out as ones who sent or received more than $20,000 from 2013 to 2015. IRS even employed a team to investigate people who used cryptocurrency to avoid taxes.\nAround 57% of people in the study also reported that they didn\u2019t pay taxes to IRS and almost half of those knew that taxes were applicable on crytocurrencies. The situation requires attention since this topic has been gaining momentum for a very long time. Exploring the behavior of these people, Jagjit Chawla, Credit Karma\u2019s general manager, said, \u201cGenerally, Americans with more complex tax situations file later in the tax season, especially if they expect that they\u2019ll owe money. However, given the popularity of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in 2017, we\u2019d expect more people to be reporting.\u201d\nDifferent Methods of Paying Cryptocurrency Tax\nCredit Karma allows users to file taxes electronically for free. Reuters reported that 1 million people used this platform to complete the payment in 2017. According to IRS, around 155 million people will be paying taxes for 2017. Last month, IRS posted a deadline on its website for tax payment, unlike the usual date of April 15, two days have been added to extend it to April 17.\nCoinbase, on the other hand, gives users the option to download their cryptocurrency transactions in an Excel file, which is not available on many exchanges. Alternatively, users can keep an Excel sheet of their own where they note down the transactions on every single activity. These files can then be imported on websites such as BitcoinTaxes and CoinTracking to automatically calculate cryptocurrency gains. Finally, users can use these details to file the Form 8949, Sales and other Dispositions of Capital Assets, to complete the process.", "category": "News"}

Those late in this race will instantly, VERY FAST, be under full dependence from leaders of these processes,\u201d wrote bitcoin investor and expert Trace Mayer, translating the words of Putin.\nGref, who oversees the most influential financial institution in Russia, has long been an optimistic cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiast. In November 2017, Gref stated that cryptocurrencies are a fact of our life, noting that cryptocurrencies will become an indispensable part of the global financial system.\n\u201cVirtual currencies are a natural outcome of blockchain technology. We may ban them, we may welcome them. It is trendy to urge people not to play with them. But they are a fact of our life,\u201d said Gref, at a meeting of the Russian entrepreneurs association.\nIn late January, Sberbank went as far to say that the bank will likely launch a cryptocurrency trading platform in the future, to address the rapidly growing demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the market from local investors.\nSberbank\u2019s Head of Global Markets Andrey Shemetov said that the bank aims to provide strategic access to all kinds of products and services investors may need to invest in the cryptocurrency market.\nIn the same month, President Putin told TASS, a Russian news agency, that regulations will be implemented to protect investors and facilitate the growth of businesses. He further noted that cryptocurrencies can operate as a medium of exchange and a settlement network, but expressed his concerns over the store of value aspect of it. \nSimilar to the viewpoint of the vast majority of bankers and government officials, Putin stated that since cryptocurrencies are not backed by anything, their value cannot be warranted.\nHowever, the lack of intrinsic value is apparent in all currencies, stocks, bonds, assets, and commodities. The value of any asset solely depends on its supply and demand, and the market is responsible for its value. Thus, the lack of intrinsic value in cryptocurrencies is a non-issue, as the market decides, in real time, the value of cryptocurrencies in the market.\nAnother World Leader Joins the Call\nLast week, India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared a similar sentiment as President Putin, as he wrote, \u201cdisruptive technologies such as Block-chain and the Internet of Things, will have a profound impact in the way we live and work. They will require rapid adaptation in our workplaces.\u201d\nMany cryptocurrency traders, investors, users, and members of the global community expressed their optimism towards the approach of Prime Minister Modi in adopting and regulating blockchain and cryptocurrency markets.", "category": "Bitcoin & Blockchain Investments"}

He had previously boasted owning the cryptocurrency, having accepted Bitcoin as payment for his 2014 album, Animal Ambition.\nInitially reported by TMZ, the rapper, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, collected around 700 Bitcoin in Animal Ambition album sales. At the time, 700 Bitcoin were worth around $400,000. By early 2018, however, that value had soared. 50 Cent was reported to have had $8 million worth of Bitcoin sitting idle.\n50 Cent decided to accept cryptocurrency because \u201cAll money is money.\u201d \nThe rapper later boasted about his Bitcoin value in instagram and twitter posts. \u201cNot bad for a kid from South Side, I\u2019m so proud of me\u201d and \u201cA little bitcoin anyone? LOL. l know l make you sick but excuse me\u2026I\u2019m getting to the bag\u201d were hardly attempts to dampen down the widespread belief he was a Bitcoin millionaire.\nHowever, when forced to prove his bankruptcy, he denied owning any bitcoin at all, according to court documents obtained by The Blast. It is claimed his cryptocurrency payments for Animal Ambition were converted instantly into USD. So why did 50 Cent previously declare his Bitcoin millionaire status?\n\u201cSo long as a press story is not irreparably damaging to my image or brand I usually do not feel the need to publicly deny the reporting. This is particularly true when I feel the press report in question is favourable to my image or brand, even if the report is based on a misunderstanding of the facts or contains outright falsehoods,\u201d the rapper reasoned.\nThe rapper originally filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2015. At the time he dismissed its seriousness, \u201cIt means you\u2019re reorganizing your finances, but it does stop things from moving forward that you don\u2019t want moving forward.\u201d\nBut over the course of what has become a lengthy and drawn-out saga, the price of Bitcoin has skyrocketed from the roughly $660 mark it was back when he released Animal Ambition to almost $20,000 at its all-time high. 50 Cent now has to prove he does not own any cryptocurrencies to prove his insolvency.\nIt has turned out that going along with positive \u2013 yet false \u2013 publicity has created an added layer of complexity in the courtroom for Jackson. The question he might rightly be facing is, \u201cNot Rich\u2026 or Still Lyin\u2019\u201d?", "category": "News"}

The bank said, for instance, that the firm would likely need to make \u201csubstantial expenditures\u201d to update and expand its existing products and services to remain competitive with fintech startups, some of whom are leveraging blockchain technology to disrupt the banking sector. Moreover, the firm admitted that, due to its less-than-friendly stance on cryptocurrency purchases, the bank risks losing customers to companies that more readily embrace them.", "category": "Banking"}

Just last month, the Texas board accused known-cryptocurrency scam BitConnect of both fraud and selling unlicensed securities. The order led to the eventual downfall of the platform, with its underlying asset losing over 90% of its value in a short period of time.\nDavorCoin, another lending platform dealing with the sale of unlicensed securities, was also recently issued an emergency order by the Texas Commissioner.

Citing discreet sources, the report claims that authorities could scrutinize bank and online-payment accounts belonging to individuals and businesses who have circumvented China\u2019s ban on domestic crypto exchanges by tapping into overseas exchanges.\nThe report added:\n\u201cThe accounts\u2019 owners could have their assets frozen or be blocked from the domestic financial system.\u201d\nThe reported move comes within weeks of a report by a newspaper run by China\u2019s central bank that called for an effective ban and blockade of foreign cryptocurrency exchange websites to keep investors from participating in trading and ICOs.\nChina was previously the world\u2019s largest trading market for cryptocurrencies up to turn of 2017 before Chinese authorities led a crackdown beginning with on-site inspections of exchanges that ultimately led to their shuttering in September 2017. The global trading volume of cryptocurrencies in Chinese renminbi (RMB) fell from over 90% at China\u2019s peak dominance to less than 1%, the PBOC-affiliated earlier stated this month.\nThe crippling curbs have led to an exodus of Chinese cryptocurrency industry, particularly miners, who have relocated to friendlier jurisdictions in Canada and Switzerland.\nBy targeting Chinese citizens continuing to purchase and trade cryptocurrencies, China\u2019s crackdown is perhaps nearing its final gong. The country\u2019s influence on global crypto markets, however, are irrelevant at this juncture. Global cryptocurrency markets at the turn of 2017, prior to China\u2019s hostile moves, were valued just under $20 billion. A year later in January this year, the overall crypto market cap reached an all-time high of $795 billion.\n", "category": "News"}

Over one-fifth of the respondents (21 percent) were even more optimistic, predicting widespread acceptance to occur within a year.\nCurrently, only around thirteen percent of small business owners in the UK accept cryptocurrency payments. A further twenty-five percent believe crypto assets will never become a mainstream method of payment for goods and services.\nThe Tumeric Co., founded by international footballer Thomas Hal-Robson-Kanu, began accepting cryptocurrency payments last year. \u201cInstantaneous settlements with no need for centralised third parties and fees are a big plus,\u201d he argued.\nSome hurdles remain before cryptocurrencies can hit the high street, however. Cryptocurrencies have a history of extreme price volatility. Small to medium-sized business owners, especially in traditional industries, require certainty and security of payment methods.\nTransaction speed is the key to overcoming price volatility, both real and perceived. There have been some positive developments on this front recently. Bitcoin\u2019s gradual adoption of segregated Witness (SegWit) and the nascent lighting network are two significant technological achievements its developers have introduced recently. \nThe growing positive sentiment toward cryptocurrencies in the UK follows positive developments elsewhere. San Francisco-based startup Litepay launched this month, allowing retailers to accept Litecoin, settled in fiat. Litepay joins Bitpay, which mid-last year launched a wallet app with prepaid Visa debit card integration.\nIn crypto-friendly Japan, Yamada Denki, the giant Japanese electronics store, recently announced it would trial Bitcoin acceptance at two of its Tokyo outlets, with plans for a nationwide rollout. \nLast November, cryptocurrency point-of-sale (POS) solutions provider for Southeast Asian retailers, Pundi X, successfully integrated into the NEM blockchain. Pundi X devices are now able to connect to both the Ethereum (ETH) and NEM (XEM) blockchains.\nThe adoption of cryptocurrencies as mainstream payment methods has been slow, but has recently shown signs of speeding up. Expedia and Overstock both started accepting Bitcoin as payment options in 2014. They were pioneers at the time.\nIf the growing \u2013 albeit slow \u2013 trend toward the more widespread adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is to continue, POS solutions providers such as Paymentsense will be key partners in enabling high street retailers to accept cryptocurrencies with confidence.", "category": "Accepts Bitcoin"}

Future developments, however, could restructure the entire financial industry and the country\u2019s currency policy.\nThe central bank will adopt \u201can open mind to accept new ideas\u201d, the new central bank chief added, specifically pointing to three technologies in big data, AI and artificial intelligence.

Data has proven to be quite the valuable commodity, with major blue-chip business models being built on its exportation and processing.\nBut what are the associated risks with relinquishing and storing so much data with centralized providers?\nEvery day as users in a connected ecosystem, we constantly give out personally identifiable information whether it be a name, address, credit card information, or even the answers to recovery questions.\nWe all had a taste of the downside of centralized, trusted big-data breaches when Equifax announced back on September 7th that their system had been breached, exposing the information of approximately 143 million consumers. The affected data included sensitive materials such as Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, and even credit card numbers.\nThis posed a huge blow to consumers, but it kickstarted a very important conversation about data integrity, and personal ownership over data that should\u2019ve started years ago. Individuals began to realize the value in both having complete control over their data, and not trusting it to multi-billion-dollar corporations that protect it simply with a password that has less character restrictions than the ones they impose on consumer accounts.\nThis is exactly where blockchain technology comes in; not to save the day necessarily with buzzwords and rapid complete adoption of the latest token, but rather to help build the infrastructure needed to prevent these types of breaches. In truth, blockchains aren\u2019t currently equipped to handle massive datasets, but there are ways in which they can be utilized to protect data on multiple levels.\nBlockchain Based Identity Verification\nOne of the first steps that can be taken with blockchain technology in regard to the protection of data is through the use of a self-sovereign identity. How could one possibly recreate the interaction of presenting a physical form of ID on a person-to-person level on the web? Phillip Windley breaks this down in a recent write-up, using an example featuring an individual showing their own ID at a bar.\nHe explains how the DMV can issue an individual a digital representation of their driver\u2019s license which can be validated both from the DMV\u2019s keys linked to their identifier, and the individual\u2019s keys linked to their own identifier. The bar in question can then verify both the integrity of the ID, and the issuer in a system of proofs through associated keys.\nuPort, one of many projects looking to tackle this allows users to selectively permission data to any service they\u2019re utilizing, and keep their data stored with them at all times. Verification comes through the ledger, and no data is kept with the verifying parties that require proof of identification. The issuer of the form of identification simply needs to verify credentials, but the actual user granting the data retains the personal information when utilizing it for verification with services.\nBloom, another project focused on credit issuance in particular, looks to mitigate the risks posed by centralized authorities handling sensitive data in the credit-issuance world by implementing secure ID\u2019s using blockchain technology.\nIn that case, companies can verify the individual utilizing their services without having to store data on their end in centralized servers.\nThe Future of Distributed Storage\nIssues of data storage and security can also benefit from blockchain technology by introducing both data splitting and encryption for protection. Decentralized data providers are looking to rise to combat the currently centralized cloud-option providers to mitigate pricing and ensure the protection of data.\nFilecoin for example deploys a form of security that provides end-to-end encryption with files in order to protect contents, all while not allowing providers to have decryption keys. Also, by distributing information across an entire network, you lose the risk of being compromised due to a single point of failure. Although massive amounts of data can\u2019t be effectively handled using blockchain technology for distribution and accessibility, it\u2019s still a goal that could potentially be within reach as the technology evolves as rapidly as it currently is.\nData Exchanges \u2013 a New Form of Marketplace\nBesides data storage, a \u201cdata marketplace\u201d presents an interesting concept that can be administered by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure both safety and security with processing.\nThe Enigma project\u2019s spin on data is creating a data-marketplace encompassing every potential vertical. Considering the desirability of large data-sets, they sought out to question how such a marketplace could operate in a trustless matter, all while maintaining data security as well.\nA major problem that the Enigma project is trying to solve with their data-marketplace vision is protecting private data on the blockchain by using what they call \u201csecret contracts.\u201d Their secret contract system\u2019s purpose is to ensure data privacy even while computations are being run on the particular data in question through a second-layer solution.\nWith their data marketplace idea came the problem of what they call \u201cdata escape,\u201d or rather, participants in the marketplace selling acquired data to other parties. Instead of disclosure, Enigma\u2019s secret contracts allow data to be processed by nodes in their network while allowing that data to remain private.\nThe age of big data isn\u2019t ending anytime soon, but the ways in which blockchain technology can be used could help mitigate the risk posed by the poor security practices of central entities, and allow individuals to take back the ownership of their own data.", "category": "Bitcoin Technology"}

Analysts expect the trend to continue, despite the recent decline in bitcoin\u2019s price.\nPrecious Metal Capital Diverts To Bitcoin\nThomson Reuters analysts, in their 2017 Gold Survey released in January, noted the rising cryptocurrency prices in December diverted significant amounts of capital from precious metals. The report said retail investors have a shorter investment horizon nowadays, and many were unable to resist the temptation to get on board with cryptocurrency.\nChristopher Louney, RBC Capital Markets strategist, said the development \u2013 a potential correlation between gold\u2019s value and cryptocurrency prices \u2013 is fairly recent, reports Fortune. He said he has noticed a potential correlation between gold\u2019s value and cryptocurrency prices.\nWhile there was no relationship previously, Louney said the trend emerged late in 2017 and continued into early 2018\u2014indicating that as bitcoin\u2019s price soared in quadruple digits, investors could have been offloading gold to buy cryptocurrencies.\nLouney stressed the correlation is minor\u2014not enough to move gold prices, and not enough to say that investors are presently considering bitcoin as gold\u2019s replacement. The macroeconomic factors that have traditionally impacted gold prices continue to dominate the playing field, such as stock market performance.\nLouney said he expects gold prices to end the year lower than they started, around $1,303 on average for the year, mainly due to rising equity returns.\nAlso read: Bitcoin is the new gold, a better safe haven asset: Goldman Sachs\nA Long Road Ahead\nBitcoin, besides being volatile, is still a relatively unknown asset compared to other investment assets. Gold, by comparison, is well established with institutional investors and has plenty of liquidity.\nWhile bitcoin trading volumes totaled to just over $3 billion in daily trading recently, gold trading volumes hit $250 billion a day, according to the World Gold Council.\nThe bitcoin-gold correlation could increase over time, said Looney. The evolving relationship also means the converse could occur, whereby bitcoin investors cash in their cryptocurrency in hard times for gold as a less volatile asset.\nIn a report sent to the bank\u2019s clients in January, Goldman Sachs analyst Zach Pandl wrote that the rapid increase in demand for bitcoin has been triggered by the growing dissatisfaction with regulated monetary systems and the current banking infrastructures.\nIn the long-term, as cryptocurrencies mature and evolve into a major asset class, Pandl said digital currencies like bitcoin will pose lower returns but demonstrate a high level of stability, like gold and other safe-haven assets.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

A similar trend occurred today, as most major cryptocurrencies including bitcoin struggled to record gains.\nBitcoin and Ethereum\nOn February 26, only Litecoin and Ethereum amongst the 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the global market managed to record daily gains. Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency Ether demonstrated a slight increase in value of 1 percent from $841 to $852, after dipping below $820 on February 25. Ether remains as the only cryptocurrency apart from Litecoin to show some upward momentum, but its trading volume is still relatively low.\n\nOver the past few weeks, Ether has tended to follow the price trend of bitcoin throughout the recovery period from its monthly lows. But, in some periods, Ether moved in a divergent path from bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Last week, when bitcoin spiked in value to $12,000, Ether and ERC 20 tokens or ICO tokens performed poorly. This week, Ether has performed better than bitcoin, moving in a different direction to the most dominant cryptocurrency in the market.\nThis week, bitcoin has struggled to remain above the $10,000 mark, which many analysts have described as the psychological threshold for traders. It is difficult to evaluate the short-term trend of bitcoin during this period in which bitcoin, the most liquid and dominant cryptocurrency in the market, is experiencing huge upswings and declines on a daily basis.\nMerely one week ago, the price of bitcoin doubled from its yearly low at $6,100, breaching the $12,000 mark. In some regions like South Korea, the price of bitcoin briefly surpassed the $13,000 mark. As of today, the price of bitcoin remains below $9,600, demonstrating little signs of recovery back to the $12,000 level in the short-term, due to its low volumes.\n\nIn early February, as CCN reported, Pantera Capital\u2019s Dan Morehead stated that the price of bitcoin will likely start increasing by the 72nd day since its major correction in January, given that most short-term bubbles typically tend to burst and momentum rebuilds in less than 3 months.\n\u201cSo it seems like another couple of weeks and everything will be kind of normal and it could start grinding back up,\u201d said Morehead.\nTether\nTether, a cryptocurrency that is backed by the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio, is an important indicator of the short-term performance of the cryptocurrency market. Many investors on major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Bitfinex utilize Tether to hedge the value of cryptocurrencies during a volatile period, especially when the market begins to fall.\nAs of February 26, the daily trading volume of Tether is $1.975 billion, making it the second most liquid cryptocurrency behind bitcoin. The large daily trading volume of Tether indicates that many traders are uncertain about the short-term trend of major cryptocurrencies, and are hedging the value of cryptocurrencies in the market to the US dollar.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

And it was from a stolen credit card number so you can never get it back,\u201d he said.\nWozniak revealed in January that he had liquidated most of his Bitcoin holdings when the flagship cryptocurrency was trading near its all-time high, explaining that he was most interested in Bitcoin for its utility but had lately found himself too caught up in its price movements.\nNevertheless, the incident is curious, given that common sense would seem to dictate that one should not sell Bitcoin \u2014 whose transactions cannot be reversed \u2014 to an unknown buyer in exchange for a credit card payment, which can be cancelled after the point of sale.\nIndeed, US residents have access to a variety of brokerage and trading platforms that charge small fees and protect sellers against counterparty risk.\nWozniak has never revealed how many BTC he owned, although he did say that he purchased the asset when it was trading at roughly $700. Depending on how large his total balance was, Wozniak could potentially have completed the transaction through one of the many over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks that process cryptocurrency sales for institutional clients.\nHowever, given that the prolific entrepreneur and investor has always described his interest in Bitcoin as an \u201cexperiment\u201d \u2014 not an investment \u2014 perhaps he desired to experience a peer-to-peer (P2P) trade. It seems, though, that he learned an expensive lesson in the process.", "category": "News"}

This transaction \u2014 believed to be the first in which a seller accepted a Bitcoin payment for a physical item \u2014 spawned both Bitcoin Pizza Day and the \u201cBitcoin Pizza Index,\u201d which calculates the present value of coins used in that historic transaction.\nOn Feb. 25, Hanyecz revealed on the Lightning Network development mailing list that he had made a similar purchase using the nascent LN mainnet (though not the first to use it to pay for a physical item).\nHe explained:\n\u201cIn short, I paid bitcoin using the lightning network and he arranged for pizza to be delivered to me. In this trade my friend is just a middle man that is taking the risk on accepting lightning payments, but it demonstrates the basic premise of how this works for everyday transactions. It could just as well be the pizza shop accepting the payment directly with their own lightning node.\u201d\nThis time, though, the transaction set him back just 649000 satoshis (0.00649 BTC), which works out to about $63 at the present exchange rate.\nSource: Laszlo Hanyecz\nTo make the purchase as \u201ctrustless\u201d as possible, the two parties opened a payment channel, which Hanyecz funded to prove that he had the BTC. When the delivery driver arrived at his house, Hanyecz showed him a portion of the payment hash preimage, which matched what the driver had been given by the seller and proved that the buyer had paid the invoice.\nRevealing part of one\u2019s hash preimage, Hanyecz stressed, is generally not advisable, but he did so in this instance in order to further enhance the trustless nature of the experiment.\nReflecting on the transaction, Hanyecz said that \u2014 at present \u2014 there was really nothing gained by completing the purchase off-chain over the Lightning Network as opposed to a conventional on-chain payment. However, he forecast that this may not always be so.\n\u201cSo is there any point to doing this instead of an on chain transaction? For what I described here, probably not. The goal was just to play around with c-lightning and do something more than shuffling a few satoshi back and forth. Maybe eventually pizza shops will have their own lightning nodes and I can open channels to them directly,\u201d he concluded.", "category": "Bitcoin Progress"}

Some of the biggest names in oil transport are leading the charge for the integration of blockchain in an industry that is ripe for distributed ledger technology given its dependence on contracts for its mere existence.\nOil transport involves ships known as tankers, which could extend as far as 500 yards, daily embarking on trips, together carrying crude oil barrels numbering in the millions, as described by Bloomberg.\u00a0It all hinges on a single paper document that sea captains are tasked with maintaining. The paper system is known as the bill of lading, and if some industry participants have their way, it could soon be replaced by a blockchain-fueled approach.\nFrom Bill of Lading to Blockchain\nWith bill of lading, transactions indicating ownership of multiple millions of dollars\u2019 worth of crude oil on a single tanker are recorded every day. The ships are responsible for nearly 50% of oil demand around the world, or $2.7 billion every day.\nDemand for these ships is on the rise amid record crude oil consumption, and that\u2019s where the blockchain steps in. But for blockchain to work, all the parties involved in crude oil transport must adopt it.\nBig Oil Is Engaged\nThe bill-of-laden approach has many flaws, not the least of which is the propensity for fraud, which is a top worry among traders. It\u2019s not surprising, then, that traders, who use a digital-based system for proprietary data, are front-in-center in the discussions about a possible industry move to blockchain.\nIn fact, oil-industry participants have moved beyond just talked. A group representing major oil players have teamed up to launch a blockchain-fueled platform for \u201cphysical oil trades,\u201d as per Bloomberg.

The companies did not disclose the terms of the deal, but\u00a0Fortune,citing an unnamed source familiar with the matter, has reported that Circle paid $400 million to acquire the US firm, which is headquartered in Boston.\nThis acquisition, one of the largest in the industry\u2019s history, is notable for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that Goldman Sachs, Baidu, and a number of other notable firms have invested in Circle. Consequently, despite Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein\u2019s sometimes-critical comments on cryptocurrency, his firm now indirectly owns stakes in both an institutional cryptocurrency trading desk and a cryptocurrency exchange.\nThis, perhaps, could indicate that institutional firms are becoming more comfortable with being linked to companies planted firmly in the center of the cryptocurrency supply chain \u2014 if only through indirect associations.\nTo some extent, this process has already begun in several major Asian markets. Upbit \u2014 now one of South Korea\u2019s largest exchanges \u2014 was established earlier this year by a subsidiary of internet company Kakao. In a similar move, Japanese messaging platform giant Line recently filed an application with regulators to establish a cryptocurrency exchange, although this application is still under review.\nFirms Line up to Take Shot at Coinbase Dominance\nAs Fortune further noted in its lengthy piece on the acquisition, the addition of Poloniex provides Circle \u2014 which also operates a lucrative over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk \u2014 revenue figures comparable to those of industry giant Coinbase, which is rumored to have made about $1 billion in revenue in 2017.\nCircle also plans to roll out a new product this year \u2014 Circle Invest \u2014 that will offer a range of brokerage and custodial services similar to those currently available at Coinbase.\nHowever, Circle is just one of several firms positioning themselves as direct rivals to the cryptocurrency industry giant, which has thus far dominated the cryptoasset brokerage market in the US and a variety of other countries.\nLast week, stock trading app Robinhood began accepting users from five states into the early access program for its new cryptocurrency trading platform, which allows retail investors to trade cryptocurrencies alongside stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a single brokerage account.\nMobile payments firm Square recently rolled out Bitcoin trading in its popular Cash App, and this feature is now available to most US customers.\nTokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer opened a US branch last year, and it now claims to be the only cryptocurrency trading platform licensed on three different continents.\nFinally, Canada-based cryptocurrency trading platform Coinsquare is preparing to raise $120 million through an initial public offering (IPO) later this year, funds it has said it will help it become a \u201cstrong competitor to Coinbase\u2026by the end of the year.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Companies"}

The world is just recognizing the countless applications of blockchain technology, not to mention the speed, security and simplicity at which transactions can be completed, and Yves Mersch of Luxembourg has suggested he\u2019s got something that can run circles around it. Mersch, an executive board member of the European Central Bank (ECB), told Bloomberg\u00a0the organization is readying\u00a0a new settlement system dubbed Target Instant Payment Settlement, or TIPS, for its November debut, which he suggests leaves blockchain in the dust.\nTIPS (not to be confused with US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities) is a product of a knee-jerk reaction among policymakers and regulators to create something that competes with blockchain, with the purpose of offering real-time payment transactions to disrupt the disrupter, if you will, of distributed ledger technology and digital coins.\nMersch, in a separate Bloomberg article, is quoted as acknowledging the connection between what he described as the virtual and physical worlds, saying a \u201ccollapse\u201d of the former could trigger a liquidity event in the latter. As a result, cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain have captured\u00a0their attention.\nCrypto Culture\nMersch touted the features of the new blockchain rival. \u201cTIPS is 10 seconds, 0.2 cents. DLT transactions are at best 30 euros and take at least one hour,\u201d he said, adding that the ECB is more result-driven than technology focused, which he alleges gives it an edge. Policymakers were more engaged than usual in the new technology, no doubt for the unexpected competition that blockchain has introduced.\nBut there are other alternatives to bitcoin, such as Ripple\u2019s XRP\u00a0for payments, not to mention the bitcoin-accelerating Lightning Network\u2019s famous pizza transaction.\nThe fact that the supposed next iteration of a decentralized blockchain is being unveiled by a centralized bank will no doubt raise some eyebrows among participants in the cryptocurrency community. But it also shows the influence that blockchain is having on the establishment, with central bankers finally addressing payments and settlement, which till now has been a cumbersome and antiquated process that\u2019s failed to keep up with the rest of technology.\nFor his part, Mersch admitted that TIPS is in the early stages, which only underscores blockchain\u2019s headstart on the ECB, not to mention the high-tech and top financial talent who have been educated at Ivy League universities and worked at top Wall Street firms drawn to the crypto culture, including rising stars.\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrencies are expected to be in focus at the forthcoming G20 meeting of monetary policymakers and finance ministers, which is to be held in Buenos Aires in March.", "category": "Banking"}

The piece was highly positive, describing the many potential benefits of the technology to both Chinese citizens and the paper\u2019s three million international readers.\nIt began by outlining the \u201chighly ingenious\u201d structure of distributed decentralized ledgers, before describing areas where the technology could be life-changing; \u201cfinancial difficulties, public welfare, supervision, counterfeiting and many other areas of pain and difficulty\u201d.

The Petro, as previously covered, is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token that\u2019s supposedly pegged to the country\u2019s notable oil reserves. The cryptocurrency\u2019s token, expected to be worth about $60, will be divisible into 100 million parts, with the smallest one being the \u201cmene.\u201d\nAccording to Latin American news source Telesur, a total of 82.4 million Petros will initially be available, out of the 100 million President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ordered. The token, announced late last year as a way to circumvent US sanctions, is set to be accepted as a payment method by the Venezuelan government and can be purchased with hard currencies and other cryptocurrencies.\nIn an announcement, Maduro was quoted as saying:\n\u201cPetro is born and we are going to have a total success for the welfare of Venezuela. \u2026 The largest and most important companies and blockchain in the world are with Venezuela, we are going to sign agreements.\u201d\nWhile hard currencies like the US dollar will be accepted, Venezuela\u2019s fiat currency, the bolivar, won\u2019t.

Venezuela, as covered, plans on conducting international business, primarily related to oil, to further bolster its adoption. The cryptocurrency, however, has been controversial since it was first announced.\nThe Controversy Surrounding the Petro\nIn Venezuela, opposition-run congress has declared the cryptocurrency sale as an \u201cillegal and unconstitutional\u201d instrument. It\u2019s seen as an \u201ceffort to illegally mortgage\u201d Venezuela\u2019s oil reserves.\nIn the US, various senators also denounced the Petro as a way to circumvent the country\u2019s sanctions. At the time, the senators wrote that \u201cit is imperative that the U.S. Treasury Department is equipped with tools and enforcement mechanisms to combat the use of cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions in general, and in this case in particular.\u201d\nVenezuela is facing one of the deepest recessions ever seen. The country\u2019s citizens currently use cryptocurrencies to survive the government\u2019s failures, while Redditors send over funds to support those in need in the country.

This represents a single-day increase of $7.2 billion and equates to an approximate advance of 1.4 percent.\nBitcoin Price Rallies Past $11,600\nThe Bitcoin price headlined the rally, notching another advance on Tuesday to cross the $11,600 threshold for the first time since Jan. 28. Following a slight pullback, Bitcoin is trading at $11,388 on Bitfinex, which nevertheless represents 24-hour progress of about five percent. Bitcoin now has a $193.4 billion market cap, and the recent uptrend has enabled the flagship cryptocurrency to increase its market share to 38.3 percent.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart\nBitcoin\u2019s advance has been notable both because it occurred during Chinese New Year \u2014 which often places sell pressure on cryptocurrencies \u2014 and because US legislators appear to have formed a bipartisan consensus around regulating cryptocurrencies.

After briefly rising as high as $959, Ethereum slipped by approximately $25 and is currently priced at $934 on Bitfinex.

While anonymous account holders can continue to buy or sell cryptocurrencies using their holdings via virtual accounts, any new cryptocurrency purchases or withdrawals in fiat will require compliance with the new KYC rules.\nAlthough a number of major banks began issuing new virtual bank accounts to cryptocurrency traders as a part of the real-name trading system, several local banks have reportedly been reluctant to follow suit with the government\u2019s intervention trading last month.\nTo remedy the situation, Choe revealed the government will \u201cencourage\u201d banks to establish ties and engage in transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges.\nChoe\u2019s remarks today further cements a striking turnaround from a ban on cryptocurrency trading first proposed by Korea\u2019s Justice Ministry.

At the time of writing this article, this video has more than 500,000 views and has not been marked as a paid promotion.\n\nThe anti-crypto campaign was orchestrated by Youtube partner network in Poland, Gamellon.

However, whilst celebratory parties were held around the globe, many in the Bitcoin world were slow to adopt the new technology \u2013 including developers of the Bitcoin Core wallet. The upcoming update in version 0.16.0\u00a0will finally implement the upgrade. But why is this big news?\nSegregated Witness or SegWit aimed to be a major improvement to the Bitcoin protocol. The upgrade redefined the structure of blocks, with one block changing from 1MB to become four million units. Witness data, which previously took up a lot of space in each block, became serialized as just one unit. This change allows more transactions to be stored in each block, leading to less load on the network, faster transactions and lower fees. SegWit also allows for the introduction of further upgrades such as Lightning Channels\u00a0\u2013 established payment paths that would further ramp up transaction speeds. Developers claim that SegWit allows for \u201cthe most efficient, flexible and safe channel design\u201d.\nWith the Bitcoin wallet now SegWit compatible the network could see an increase in the use of the technology. Last week CCN reported that only 15% of Bitcoin transactions currently employ SegWit, but this will most likely substantially increase following today\u2019s news and an update earlier this month from Coinbase.\nThe major gateway between the fiat and cryptocurrency worlds has also scheduled SegWit\u00a0implementation,\u00a0with the update expected in the coming weeks following heavy pressure. Users had been increasingly vocal in their support for the technology, launching a petition calling for the exchange platform to prioritize SegWit implementation. The petition noted that the Bitcoin community is \u201coverwhelmingly in support\u201d of SegWit, and had gathered over twelve-thousand signatures.\nWith increased SegWit adoption, supporters of the Bitcoin protocol hope that it will be able to overcome the high transaction costs and long waiting times that users have recently struggled with under periods of high load. What remains to be seen is if this upcoming upgrade can support the increasingly growing number of transactions for the foreseeable future, and at the same time face off growing competition from alternative currencies utilizing different technologies.", "category": "Bitcoin Progress"}

The bank conducts extra due diligence with parties in the chain of cryptocurrencies rather than those in traditional markets that are conducting payments with cryptocurrencies.\nA Dutch news source, Follow the Money, reported on the ING account previously.\nING Supports Cryptocurrency\nBitfinex has not identified what banks it has been making transactions with since last year. The ING account is important, however, since ING is a global bank that is willing to work with one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. This is a hot topic within the cryptocurrency market because the nonregulated cryptocurrency venues provide little information about their financial operations.\nWells Fargo discontinued its role as a Bitfinex correspondent bank in March of 2017. Bitfinex then directed customers to Bank Spoldzielczy, documents indicated. A Spoldzielczy bank official in December declined to say if Bitfinex was a client.\nBitfinex has been under CFTC scrutiny since early December on account of a lack of information provided about Tether, a digital currency run by the same management team as Bitfinex.\nOn account of the lack of evidence from Tether, the CFTC on Dec. 6 issued subpoenas to both Tether and Bitfinex, according to a source interviewed last month.\u00a0The company has not provided evidence of its holdings or submitted to an audit, even though it has claimed the coins are backed by U.S. dollars held in reserve.\nRobert Ford, an outside spokesman for Tether and Bitfinex, did not immediately return an email seeking comment.\nDutch Lawmaker Wants Answers\nHenk Nijboer a member of the opposition Labour Party in the Dutch Parliament, asked Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra on Monday to clarify ING\u2019s involvement with Bitfinex.\nAround $2.2 billion in Tether coins circulated as of Tuesday, Tether reported.\nTether is the second-most traded cryptocurrency after bitcoin, according to Coinmarketcap.com data.\nTeunis Brosens, an ING senior economist specializing in cryptocurrency, last month criticized the digital token on RTLZ, a Dutch business news program.\nBrosens said every time bitcoin gained, Tether did as well, which seemed as if they were printed to support the bitcoin quote. Should Tether destabilize, it will mean the next blow for cryptocurrency, he said.\nTether Controversy Continues\nThe Tether controversy continues as USDT\u2019s market cap grows despite the lack of an audit proving that tokens are full-backed by USD reserves.\nBitfinex and Tether told Bloomberg they routinely receive legal process from law enforcement and regulators conducting investigations, and that it is their policy not to comment on any such requests.\nAs Tether\u2019s market cap ballooned to nearly $2.3 billion in January, questions have been raised about whether USDT is fully-backed by U.S. dollars stored in company-owned bank accounts \u2014 as Tether claims.\nAlso read: CFTC subpoenas Bitfinex and Tether as questions mount over audit\nCriticism Rages\nSome, most notably pseudonymous critic Bitfinex\u2019ed, have alleged that Tether is operating a fractional reserve to artificially inflate the bitcoin price and \u2014 he claims \u2014 cover up alleged insolvency at Bitfinex. The exchange, meanwhile, has promised to pursue legal action against individuals making \u201cpatently false\u201d claims about the company.\nWhile these claims have not been proven, Tether\u2019s long-awaited balance sheet audit has yet to materialize. CCN reported that the relationship between Tether and its auditor, Friedman LLP, has been dissolved, although neither firm responded to requests seeking more information.\nBitfinex\u2019ed alleges that is issuing USDT tokens that are not actually backed by actual dollars stored in company-owned bank accounts.

Following the day\u2019s bearish pivot, the Bitcoin price is at risk of dropping below $10,000, while other top coins continue to shed market share.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nAltogether, the cryptocurrency market cap took a seven percent hit, declining to $445.2 billion after entering the day at $479.6 billion.\nBitcoin Price Risks Falling into Sub-$10,000 Territory\nThe Bitcoin price returned an index-matching seven percent decline, which forced the value of the flagship cryptocurrency down to $10,274 on Bitfinex. This signifies a more than $1,500 decline since Tuesday when the Bitcoin price appeared poised to punch past resistance at $12,000.\nBitcoin now has a $175.2 billion market cap. This translates into a 39.4 percent market share, which \u2014 notably \u2014 represents a 0.3 percent increase from its previous-day level, indicating that traders are rotating their holdings back into Bitcoin.\nBitcoin Price Chart\nThere does not appear to be a definitive trigger for the decline. Perhaps, unsure about the duration of the recovery, traders wise enough to strengthen their positions when Bitcoin was trading near $6,000 are taking money off the table to secure profits.\nEthereum Price Holds Above $825\nThe Ethereum price endured a similar plight, declining about seven-and-one-third percent to reach a present value of $826 on Bitfinex. Ethereum can now claim an $81.2 billion market cap, which translates into an 18.2 percent market share.\nEthereum Price Chart\nAltcoins Continue to Shed Market Share\nAltcoins, meanwhile, failed to capitalize on the struggles faced by the two largest cryptocurrencies. Just three coins in the top 100 rose against the dollar, and a variety of top-tier cryptocurrencies could not even keep pace with the index\u2019s seven percent pullback.\n\nThird-ranked Ripple declined by seven percent, causing its price to plunge back below dollar parity. Bitcoin Cash, however, performed even worse. The fourth-largest cryptocurrency took a 10 percent hit that reduced its price to $1,240.\nLitecoin and Cardano each declined by about six-and-a-half percent, causing their prices to decline to present values of $205 and $0.32, respectively. The EOS price declined by eight percent and is now trading just above $8.\nNEO, ranked eighth, declined by seven percent, while Stellar\u2019s eight percent decline reduced its price to $0.36. Rounding out the top 10 was IOTA, which posted a 10 percent decline and is currently valued at $1.71.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

While these trades do not take place on the Bitcoin blockchain itself, exchanges handle a significant amount of deposits and withdrawals.\nThe company made the announcement in a blog post, and CTO Paolo Ardoino said that it will provide users with several noticeable improvements:\n\u201cSegWit provides not only an immediate benefit for users, but also a foundation for future Bitcoin development. By supporting SegWit addresses, Bitfinex is tackling three of the biggest crypto-enthusiast concerns: transaction fees, transaction speed, and total network capacity. We are delighted that through this implementation we can provide our customers with bitcoin withdrawal fees that are up to 20 percent lower, as well as faster-than-ever transaction speeds.\u201d\nFirst activated on the Bitcoin network in August, SegWit (short for Segregated Witness) reduces the size of transactions and attacks the threat of rising transaction fees on two fronts.\nSince transactions are smaller, individual payments cost less than they would if sent from legacy addresses. As more users begin sending payments from SegWit addresses, it should lead to an overall increase in the transaction capacity of the network, reducing congestion and leading to a further decrease in fees.\nCoinbase to Begin Phased SegWit Launch in a \u2018Few Days\u2019\nLater in the day, cryptocurrency brokerage firm Coinbase revealed that\u00a0it was placing the finishing touches on SegWit integration and will begin a phased launch to customers within the next few days with a goal of having the feature fully rolled-out by next week.\n\nOur engineering team has finished testing of SegWit for Bitcoin on Coinbase.\nWe will be starting a phased launch to customers over the next few days and are targeting a 100% launch to all customers by mid next week.\n\u2014 Coinbase (@coinbase) February 20, 2018\n\nThese announcements followed another major development in SegWit adoption, as it has been revealed that Bitcoin Core version 0.16.0 \u2014 slated to release in the coming days \u2014 will include finally include full support for SegWit as well.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

At many locations, customers can also have their mining rigs assembled by sellers while they wait, and still pay less. One key destination is Hong Kong\u2019s Sham Shui Po market, which is made even more attractive due to the lack of sales tax. However, the boom in sales is being felt across Asia \u2013 a welcome respite. Sales had been falling in recent years with the demand for personal computers dropping significantly.\u00a0The equipment is mostly manufactured in China, with GPU\u2019s being developed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia.\nThe drive behind the rush for computer equipment is cryptocurrency mining \u2013 the process that ensures the security of Proof of Work protocols such as Bitcoin. Computers race to solve complex mathematical calculations, and when they find a solution are allowed to write a block on the chain and are rewarded. This is how new Bitcoins are created, and the rapid rise in cryptocurrency prices has seen a surge in those looking to start mining.\nHowever, experts note that there are several limitations to home mining rigs. Initial starting costs can range anywhere from a few thousand dollars to tens of thousands or more, and mining is a highly energy-intensive process, adding further costs. Moreover, the average home miner is in direct competition with much more powerful machines and mining farms, which can mean infrequent payouts. It can take many months of constant work to make back investments costs and begin to profit.\nWhilst small miners may struggle, manufacturers are raking huge profits from the hype. Earlier this year AMD announced\u00a0revenues of $1.48 billion, a 34 percent year-on-year increase. Computing and Graphics cards contributed $958 million to this figure \u2013 rising 60 percent. Nvidia has also benefited, with the company announcing a $150m boost in revenue from miners. The reason for the huge boost is that crypto mining has created a huge demand for GPUs, with the average mining rigs holding anywhere from six to twelve GPU cards.\u00a0 The craze has left manufactures racing to meet demand. It has also been reported that development has begun on mining specific cards that are stripped down and come with a reduced warranty, in a bid to boost production.\nThe high demand is also being felt in Asian bazaars. One shop owner said that\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve been selling more these few months and we often run out of stock\u201d. Another seller Liu Xiao Yu in Singapore told Reuters:\n\u201cThere was a customer who asked for a rig with 500 GPU cards, which amounted to over S$350,000 ($262,700)\u2026There was another who came by last week asking for 1,000 GPU cards, but I am afraid to accept the offer as supplies are low now.\u201d\nThe profitability of mining depends entirely upon the cryptocurrency markets, and demand for equipment falls significantly when the market crashes. However, those in the industry are confident of good business for the foreseeable future, commenting:\n\u201cOnce the value of Bitcoin increases again, we will receive multiple calls and emails from customers all over the world.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

However, given its rapid popularity among its user-base, it would not be surprising to see Robinhood rapidly capture a sizable share of the US cryptocurrency brokerage market.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

The agency, which attributed this development to the \u201crecent cryptocurrency boom,\u201d said that it had concluded that cash-settled cryptocurrency contracts qualified as derivatives, making them subject to AMF oversight.\n\u201cThe AMF concludes that a cash-settled cryptocurrency contract may qualify as a derivative, irrespective of the legal qualification of a cryptocurrency,\u201d the agency said in the statement. \u201cAs a result, online platforms which offer cryptocurrency derivatives fall within the scope of MiFID 2 and must therefore comply with the authorisation, conduct of business rules, and the EMIR trade reporting obligation to a trade repository.\u201d\nThe AMF added that, as regulated products, platforms were barred from advertising certain financial contracts.\nBloomberg reports that at least two French trading platforms \u2014 Plus500 Ltd. and IG Group Holdings Plc. \u2014 had reported strong growth in their quarterly earnings reports, which they attributed in part to their cryptocurrency futures and derivatives products.\nIn the US, regulated exchanges CBOE and CME began listing Bitcoin futures contracts last December, while cryptocurrency derivatives exchange LedgerX began processing orders several months earlier. Most of these products have targeted institutional investors, although CBOE\u2019s contracts have been cheap enough \u2014 each contract represents 1 BTC compared to CME\u2019s 5 BTC contracts \u2014 to attract interest from retail investors as well.\nBloomberg notes that the AMF\u2019s increased interest in unregulated cryptocurrency futures and derivatives trading comes amid a wider European Union (EU) crackdown on retail-focused derivatives products.

Montroll of Texas who also ran digital wallet service WeExchange Australia, with two counts of perjury and obstruction of justice.

The hackers did so by exploiting a weakness in the exchange\u2019s code.\nThe hack occurred in July 2013, and Montroll allegedly misled regulators by testifying then that the exchange\u2019s systems were successful at blocking it.

Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has stated that the government already netted $735 million from the token\u2019 sale, without backing his claim with any evidence.\nThe Petro is set to be used to pay taxes, fees, and other public needs, as well as in international deals, particularly those related to oil. 84.2 billion tokens will be disbursed, out of the 100 million ordered by Maduro. The country\u2019s opposition-run congress has criticized the cryptocurrency\u2019s sale as an \u201cillegal and unconstitutional\u201d instrument to illegally mortgage the country\u2019s oil reserves, yet investors are still seemingly pouring in.\nEarlier this month, citing the project\u2019s whitepaper, CCN reported that the Petro is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token that\u2019s set to have a private presale. According to the whitepaper found on the project\u2019s official website, hosted by the country\u2019s Ministerio del Poder Popular para Educacion Universitaria, Ciencia e Tecnologia (MPPEUCT), that report was correct.\nThe whitepaper reads (roughly translated):\n\u201cThe Presale will begin on February 20, 2018 and will consist of the creation and sale of an ERC20 token on the [blockchain] of the ethereum platform. This process will promote and guarantee demand for the Petro Initial Offer, which will be made later.\u201d\nHowever, on the Petro\u2019s website, we can also find a buyer\u2019s manual that explains how users can set up a wallet to hold their tokens. The manual states that the Petro \u201cwill work on the chain of NEM blocks,\u201d adding that \u201cthe wallets and programming elements are related to this technological platform.\u201d\nDespite the discrepancy between the two documents, on Twitter, an account that claims to be the \u201cOfficial account of the Journalistic Writing Room of the Presidency\u201d seems to confirm the Petro uses the NEM blockchain. The tweet cites Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who stated (roughly translated):\n\u201cWe have signed two fundamental agreements for El Petro to circulate on the most advanced platforms in the world, thanks to the confidence of the companies Zeus and NEM.\u201d\nNEM\u2019s official account responded to the tweet, seemingly distancing itself from Venezuela\u2019s move. The tweet reads that NEM\u2019s technology is \u201cfreely open to any individual organization,\u201d and that the \u201cNEM Foundation abstains from political endorsements.\u201d\n\nThe NEM technology is freely open to any individual or organization that wants to use it.

The ethical hackers have assisted authorities and encouraged others to join in providing aid. One prominent white hat known by the Twitter handle JK17 managed to identify the accounts that the stolen money was sent to shortly after the breach. The information was shared with the NEM foundation, and the accounts have been marked and are currently being monitored. The funds have now been moved to over 400 accounts including some owned by innocent holders, in what appears to be an attempt to confuse trackers.\nHowever, many more white hats have reportedly joined the hunt, making short work of the task. Shota Hamabe, a 34-year-old programmer is one such individual. Shortly after the breach, he\u00a0held an information session at Hackers Bar, a restaurant and IT hub in Tokyo\u2019s Roppongi district, to coordinate and discuss options.\nWhilst JK17, Hamabe and others have been highly effective in locating and flagging the accounts where the stolen NEM has been moved to, efforts to identify the owners of the accounts, (the hackers responsible), have been unsuccessful. It was reported that one NEM trader had been questioned by Tokyo police regarding the incident, however, no further information has been provided regarding the individual\u2019s involvement. Officers are also analyzing access logs in Coincheck\u2019s system in an attempt to identify the culprits, but this may be a lengthy process. Meanwhile, it appears that nearly 9 billion yen ($83.6m) worth of NEM is believed to have been exchanged for Bitcoin and other virtual currencies using the dark web and other anonymous services. It remains to be seen whether the hackers will be brought to account.\nThe exchange is assisting in the efforts and has promised to compensate all traders who have been affected by the breach in full. It\u2019s a move that the company hope will save it\u2019s reputation and public image, however, users of the platform are voicing their increasing concerns. Last week a group of Coincheck traders initiated a lawsuit against the service, voicing their outrage that withdrawals for cryptocurrencies not affected by the breach had still not been reopened.\nWhether or not the thieves are apprehended, the work of white hat hackers serves as a reminder that the cryptocurrency communities and cryptocurrencies themselves also can be highly positive. Hamabe told reporters that:\n\u201cThe incident has created a negative image of virtual currencies, but I believe they can make a huge difference in the way we transmit data and handle business.\u201d", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The second round of the presale, for instance, caught many investors by surprise.\nDevelopers, meanwhile, have conveyed a great deal of skepticism about Telegram\u2019s ability to achieve the goals it has laid out for the Telegram Open Network (TON), including its claim that the network will process 1 million transactions per second.", "category": "ICO News"}

At the time of writing, Nano (XRB) is up almost 20 percent to the US dollar and almost 25 percent against Bitcoin. \n\nAt the time of writing, Nano is priced at $8.82. According to coinmarketcap, all top thirty coins have fallen except Nano, Populous, and Tether, the latter two only marginally in the green. \n\nThe coin is currently the 24th largest, with a market cap of $1,166,932,553. Nano was rebranded from RaiBlocks on the 31st of January. It boasts transaction speeds averaging just over one-and-a-half seconds, making it one of the fastest cryptocurrencies to send and receive. \nThe sender and the receiver conduct Proof-of-Work using a \u201cblock lattice\u201d structure. This unique structure means that each account, as determined by its public key, is itself a blockchain. XRB is fast, free, and minerless. Each user effectively mines the coins as they use them. Nano boasts unlimited scalability, theoretically, and operates on a lightweight protocol.\nThe currency has endured a tumultuous start to the year. Given its unique structure, the ability for large-scale exchanges to support it was limited. While now listed on kucoin and binance, some 30 percent of Nano volume was exchanged on Italian-based BitGrail. The coin represented roughly 85 percent of BitGrail\u2019s trading volume.\nA hack of BitGrail of $170 M worth of Nano was revealed on February 9th. The exchange was operated by a controversial figure in the crypto-space known as Francesco \u2018The Bomber\u2019 Firano. The incident resulted in a very public falling out between Firano and the Nano Core Development Team. BitGrail blamed the security breach on bugs in Nano\u2019s code. Firano suggested a fork to recover the funds.\nThe Nano team refused to fork the protocol, accusing BitGrail of being at fault. On a medium post dated 10th February, they also argued that BitGrail had been insolvent for a number of months, with suspicious transactions occurring as far back as October last year:\n\u201cWe now have sufficient reason to believe that Firano has been misleading the Nano Core Team and the community regarding the solvency of the BitGrail exchange for a significant period of time.\u201d\nNano\u2019s priced plummeted at the news of BitGrail\u2019s insolvency and the loss of Nano coins, but has since bounced back amid amid a wider mid-week slump. So why is Nano bucking the trend? The Nano team recently announced the launch of a Beta version of Nano wallet for Android:\n\nThe team tested the first Nano transfer using the new app only last week. Perhaps this development will help propel Nano\u2019s price further. Now being traded easily on binance and kucoin, an Android wallet might prove a further boost to XRB\u2019s usability.\nIt is also possible that Nano attracted opportunistic buyers with its depressed price in the wake of the BitGrail hack and the January crypto slump. Having said that, amid a market correction, it is not unusual to see one or two coins in the green. For the enthusiastic Nano community, let\u2019s hope the currency continues to hold firm against a backdrop of red.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The cryptocurrency, according to local news source Telesur, will be backed by precious metals. Notably, Maduro\u2019s announcement was made Wednesday (Feb. 21), one day after Venezuela launched its oil-backed cryptocurrency, the Petro.\nAs covered by CCN, the Petro (PTR) was announced back in December, as a way for the country to bypass sanctions and fight an \u201ceconomic war\u201d with the United States. The Petro\u2019s pre-sale is currently ongoing, and according to Maduro it\u2019s already netted $735 million, although he didn\u2019t back this claim with any evidence.\nShortly after the Petro was announced, Venezuela\u2019s opposition-run congress criticized the cryptocurrency\u2019s sale, as an \u201cillegal and unconstitutional\u201d instrument to mortgage the country\u2019s oil reserves. The US warned that citizens who bought the cryptocurrency could be violating the sanctions, while investors voiced concerns over Venezuela\u2019s solvency and transparency.\nYet, in a televised speech, Maduro revealed a Petro Gold is on the way:\n\u201cNext week I\u2018m going to launch the petro gold, backed by gold, which is even more powerful, that will strengthen the petro.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t clear if the Venezuelan leader is referring to the gold reserves in the central bank, or to an undeveloped mineral deposit. Other details about the cryptocurrency haven\u2019t yet been revealed.\nAccording to Telesur, investors from Brasil, Denmark, Honduras, Poland, Norway, and the Middle East have expressed interest in the Petro, either in accepting it as a form of payment, or investing in it.\nThe Petro\u2019s launch was, to say the least, confusing, as some users reportedly faced JavaScript errors while trying to purchase the cryptocurrency. Others couldn\u2019t get their orders matched on decentralized exchange EtherDelta. Moreover, it isn\u2019t clear which blockchain the token is using, as different documents suggest it is either that of NEM or Ethereum.\nCryptocurrency investors are trying to figure out what to make of the new cryptocurrency, the Petro Gold. Speaking to Reuters, founder of cryptoasset investment firm Redwood City Ventures Sean Walsh revealed it was hard to reach a conclusion without any details, but added he wasn\u2019t interested in tokens backed by physical assets. He stated:\n\u201cRather than buying a cryptocurrency backed by gold, I\u2019d just go buy the gold. Gold is a physical thing that you want to be able to hold in your hands, because that\u2019s the point.\u201d\nVenezuela is currently facing one of the deepest recessions ever seen. Citizens are forced to use cryptocurrencies to survive, as the country\u2019s fiat currency has plunged in value.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

He made a splash with his call that cryptocurrencies are on their way to being a multi-trillion dollar market, though he admits to Bloomberg\u00a0cryptos remain an \u201cearly-stage technology\u201d that could be a bumpy road at times.\n\u201cThe pathway to $1 trillion eventually is fairly certain. How we get there is going to be volatility and uncomfortable. I think we\u2019ll get there pretty soon, though.

But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were a significant drawdown again before we got there,\u201d Hougan told Bloomberg.\nFor instance, Hougan suggests the cryptocurrency markets could suffer a 50% drop before attaining a $1 trillion combined market cap. And as the leading digital coins have proven so far in 2018, volatility is the name of the game. \u201cI think for investors the important thing to realize it\u2019s an extremely volatile, high-risk asset.

The reason, Hougan suggested, is because the leaderboard can shift. \u201cThe first mover isn\u2019t always the winner,\u201d he told Bloomberg, adding:\n\u201cThe large caps have the\u00a0largest chance of success but nothing is guaranteed. Investors would be foolish to bet on a single cryptocurrency \u2013 you want to diversify your exposure,\u201d advised Hougan.\nIn his new role, Hougan will be focused on classification and analysis of cryptocurrencies.

The plan is to fast-track a self-regulatory environment to better secure investors, particularly in the wake of the recent hack of Tokyo-based exchange Coincheck where some $530 million in NEM tokens was stolen less than a month ago.\nThese sources have also claimed that a previously reported plan to combine two of Japan\u2019s cryptocurrency industry bodies, the Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association and the Japan Blockchain Association, to form on self-regulating entity have now been scrapped after talks dropped to merge the two bodies. Instead, the new self-regulating body will notably be registered with Japan\u2019s Financial Services Association (FSA), the country\u2019s financial regulator.\nWhile details of the new body are scarce, it is more than likely that the 16 exchanges behind the soon-to-be-launched entity are the sixteen currently licensed cryptocurrency exchanges registered with the FSA.\nFollowing new legislation of the revised Payment Services Act in April last year, cryptocurrency exchange operators are required to be licensed by the regulator. Exceptions on a provisional basis are allowed, particularly to operational exchanges predating the new legislation of which Coincheck is a notable example.\nIn September, the FSA granted licenses to 11 cryptocurrency exchanges to operate in the country, a number that has since swelled to 16 according to recent reports. Meanwhile, Japanese police continue their investigation into last month\u2019s theft of Coincheck while the exchange\u2019s operators continue to assure NEM victims of refunds.

Come December, the legislation passed, putting Australian bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges under the purview of the Australian Transactions and Reporting Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the country\u2019s financial intelligence body and watchdog.\nUnder the new rules, cryptocurrency exchanges will be required to register themselves on the authority\u2019s \u2018Digital Currency Exchange Register\u2019 and report any suspicious transactions, international transactions and fiat cash deposits that exceed AUD$10,000.\n\u201cThis will stamp out fraud and allow innovation to flourish; a bold move that will benefit Australians for years to come,\u201d Paul McKenzie, operations manager at Victoria-based digital currency exchange ACX.io said at the time.\nCryptocurrency scams are nothing new and have seen a number of regulators and watchdogs turning up their scrutiny against fraudulent crypto-related investment schemes. A notable example is that of OneCoin, a digital currency investment scheme widely seen as fraud.\nOther moves against alleged scams in recent weeks sees the US CFTTC filing charges against My Big Coin, an alleged cryptocurrency-based Ponzi accused of misappropriating over $6 million in customer funds. Details of an Austrian scam involving bitcoin emerged recently, hinting at a widespread investment scheme that may have raked in some 12,000 bitcoins (approx. $131 million in current prices) from 10,000 victims in Austria, Poland, Romania and former Yugoslavia.", "category": "Bitcoin Scams"}

The price of bitcoin reached $11,950 at its daily peak and declined down to $10,900, by more than $1,000, as the cryptocurrency market dropped by over $20 billion. Bitcoin has since rebounded back to $11,200, sustaining its short-term momentum.\nOn February 21, the bitcoin dominance index, which measures the dominance of bitcoin over the entire cryptocurrency market, achieved a monthly high at 39.1 percent. The increase in the bitcoin dominance index can be attributed to the increase in demand for bitcoin from newcomers entering the cryptocurrency market after a massive correction had occurred in January.\nWhen newcomers and casual investors enter the market, naturally, the first cryptocurrency they invest in is bitcoin, as it is the most dominant cryptocurrency in the market. In the short-term, it is likely that bitcoin will continue to outperform tokens and cryptocurrencies in the market.\n\nMany tokens have recorded large gains against the US dollar over the past week. But, against bitcoin, the majority of tokens have recorded fairly large losses.\nLocal mainstream media outlets in South Korea including Chosun and HanKyoReh have also reported that cryptocurrency premiums within the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market, better known as the Kimchi Premium, have started to increase again. Within the past week, South Korean cryptocurrency premiums rose from 2 percent to 7 percent, as the demand for the cryptocurrency market increased rapidly.\nIn January, the price of bitcoin dropped to the $6,000 region, after achieving an all-time high at $19,000. Within a month, the price of bitcoin nearly doubled, as it climbed up to $11,200 relatively quickly, when many analysts expected a bear market to emerge and last for many months before a major recovery.\nWith major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Bitfinex adopting SegWit, analysts remain optimistic in the scalability of the Bitcoin network, and that may fuel the price growth of bitcoin as well in the upcoming weeks. SegWit adoption rate remains below 14 percent at the time of writing, and Coinbase\u2019s integration of SegWit could lead to a massive spike in the adoption of SegWit.\nEthereum and Tokens\nAgainst bitcoin, Ethereum and ERC20 tokens have performed poorly in the past week, and as bitcoin continues to build momentum, it is likely that Ethereum and tokens based on the Ethereum network will continue to fall against bitcoin in the short-term.\nStill, Ethereum has performed better against bitcoin than other major cryptocurrencies such as Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Cardano, which have all recorded 6 to 10 percent losses against the most dominance cryptocurrency in the market.\nIf Ether can recover to the $1,000 mark in the next few days, given that it has followed the price trend of bitcoin since January, it will establish a strong ground for mid-term price growth. However, if it continues to fall behind bitcoin along with the rest of the market, Ether could have a difficult time matching price growth rate of bitcoin in the short-term.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Beetech in Brazil and Zip Remit in Canada aim to process payments on the RIpple blockchain network with remittance service providers in China, as Chinese remittance companies have entered RippleNet in February.\nPatrick Griffin, Ripple\u2019s head of business development, emphasized the necessity of a blockchain solution like Ripple in the global remittance and payments industries, especially for businesses and consumers in emerging markets. Griffin explained that blockchain technology can ease the process for individuals sending money from abroad to their home countries, specifically for expat workers and international businesses.\n\u201cThe payments problem is a global problem, but its negative impact disproportionally affects emerging markets. Whether it\u2019s a teacher in the U.S. sending money home to his family in Brazil, or a small business owner in India trying to move money to open up a second store in another country, it\u2019s imperative that we connect the world\u2019s financial institutions into a payments system that works for their customers, not against them,\u201d said Griffin.\nAs CCN reported in January, Ripple partnered with some of the world\u2019s largest remittance providers such as MoneyGram to process international payments on its blockchain network. If Ripple can build an ecosystem and a community of major remittance service providers in both major regions like the US and emerging markets, individuals will be able to send and receive both small and large payments through the Ripple blockchain, with reduced costs.\nThe key is building a connection between remittance providers to ensure that there exists a decentralized and peer-to-peer platform with which institutions can send and receive money to and from each other.\nAlready, RippleNet has included large-scale remittance service providers in Singapore, China, and other countries in Asia. InstaReM alone processes more than 500,000 transactions initiated by consumers in more than 60 countries, including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore and India.\n2018 is an important year for Ripple, and it is a period in which it will have to justify the partnerships it had created in 2017 through increasing daily transaction volumes and user activity. In 2017, Ripple was criticized by the lack of transaction volumes coming from banks that have partnered with Ripple Labs to process transactions.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

Someone Just Split & Moved 664,000 Bitcoin Gold\nOn Tuesday, approximately 664,000 BTG were moved for the first time, the largest single-day increase since the network launch in November.\nAs CCN reported, the fork officially occurred on October 25, although the developers premined the blockchain for several weeks before launching the BTG network in mid-November. Since the network was created through a fork of Bitcoin, all BTC holders received an equivalent number of BTG coins on the new chain.\nMost of these coins were claimed and moved in the first several weeks following the network\u2019s launch, and coin splitting tapered over the ensuing three months \u2014 until this week, that is.\nSource: forks.network\n\u00a0\nThe development was first spotted by Antoine Le Calvez a data engineer at cryptocurrency startup Blockchain who also created a website that tracks coin splitting following forks. He attributed the transactions to Bitcoin storage service Xapo.\nWhile Xapo already distributed airdropped Bitcoin Gold to its customers shortly after the October fork, it\u2019s possible that the present transaction was made on behalf of one or more of the firm\u2019s many institutional clients.\nIf the owners of those coins intend to sell them, they will be doing so at a time when the Bitcoin Gold price is near an all-time low.\nThe coin had traded above $400 on several occasions in November and December, but it never gained the traction that Bitcoin Cash \u2014 a fork predicated on a longstanding ideological disagreement over the future of Bitcoin \u2014 managed to achieve following its fork in August.\nBTG weathered the recent market correction rather poorly, plunging as low as $74 on Feb. 5 before experiencing a moderate recovery.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin Gold was trading at a global average of $127, which translates into a $2.2 billion market cap and ranks BTG as the 20th-largest cryptocurrency.\nAt the current market price, the 664,000 coins are nominally worth about $84.3 million. However, CoinMarketCap data indicates that BTG has just $40 million in daily trading volume, which will make it difficult to unload the 664,000 coins (if that is the owner\u2019s intention) without causing the market to crash.\nIndeed, the mere fact that these coins have been moved could cause traders to price in a sell-off, sending BTG\u2019s value even lower than it currently stands.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

Under the new framework, officials are prohibited from storing them in internet-connected wallets. This effectively forces them to adopt a cold storage solution, and it also prevents them from disposing of seized cryptocurrencies by selling them on exchanges.\nAccording to the report, the Treasury wants to sell the bitcoins in a series of auctions to ensure that it achieves optimal pricing.

RedLock\u2019s latest research noted a changing security context; one that underpins a changing landscape from data theft to computational power theft. Tesla, a RedLock client, was reportedly a victim of a\u00a0serious crypto-jacking incident when poor access hygiene resulted in system access credentials becoming vulnerable to external access.\nWhat We Know\nThe RedLock team, working in partnership with Tesla, has published a new report on the alarming increase in crypto-jacking and how the security landscape is shifting from data theft to computational power theft. The \u201cCrypto-jacking Epidemic\u201d, as RedLock describes the issue, will have far-reaching consequences for enterprise computing\nRedLock\u2019s Cloud Security Intelligence (CSI) team late last year, \u201cfound hundreds of Kubernetes administration consoles accessible over the internet without any password protection,\u201d providing access to Gemlato and Aviva \u2013 two multinational companies. The latest company hit by this epidemic is Tesla. The electric vehicle manufacturer, the CSI team noted, was similarly attacked through Kubernetes console with poor access hygiene.\nThe RedLock team found that, internally, Tesla worked with Amazon Web Services (AWS) which also included Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) \u2013 access to this data allowed the hackers to glean information on the telemetry and other vehicle data metrics from Tesla\u2019s testing fleet.\nHowever, accessing this sensitive information wasn\u2019t the overall purpose of the \u2018hack\u2019. The real purpose was to undertake crypto mining by using the spare capacity afforded by AWS and Tesla\u2019s computational needs. The evasive measures undertaken by the hackers highlight how sophisticated this new computational threat will become.\nThe hackers did not use \u2018mining pools\u2019 in the normal public computing sense. They installed mining pool software and then configured the software to create an \u201cunlisted\u201d semi-public endpoint which made it difficult for IP-threat intelligence software to analyse the malicious threat.\nThe hackers also used CloudFare to \u2018hide\u2019 the IP address of the \u2018mining pool\u2019 which provided a free content delivery network platform. This IP \u2018sleight-of-hand\u2019 makes it difficult for domain/IP tracking to work cohesively when combating this type of cybersecurity threat.\nThe final touch was a sophisticated CPU usage counter-measure that saw the hackers configure the mining software to work at low usage levels to avoid detection. This streamlined usage of computational power could prove to be a fundamental problem in the global enterprise computing environment.\nCountering the Threat\nThe single biggest problem outlined in this case study is the pervasiveness of poor access hygiene. The best weapon available to any organisation is, and remains, good information security hygiene protocols. Sound management of access permissions and the user levels therein can provide organisations with sound structural cyber security foundations.\nRedLock\u2019s latest security report found that 73 percent of organisations are still allowing root user accounts to perform key computational tasks. As industry advice states, this goes against sector-wide best practice guidelines. Amazon has openly stated that administrators need to lock root-level user access and instead created layered user profiles with access connected to role requirements and computational usage demands.\nRedLock\u2019s CSI team noted that, in the Tesla experience, hygiene processes around access keys resulted in tardy rotation practices. In some cases, some access keys hadn\u2019t been rotated in over 90 days, around 40% of the systems verified by the team accounted for this high incidence. This is problematic because these keys will have higher-levels of access that can result in system compromise \u2013 and would provide a suitable opportunity for hackers to utilise such space for nefarious needs.\nRedLock\u2019s advises clients to follow a simple four-step procedure to help curb the possibilities of computational theft for the purposes of crypto-jacking. They advise the following:\n\nEnd non-IT specific users access to root accounts\nOn all privileged user accounts, utilise multi-factor authentication steps to protect key accounts\nCreate a hygiene policy framework that force rotates access keys \u2013 without user bypass/system by-pass facilities.\nDevelop user and access behaviour metrics and monitor to identify deviation \u2013 this could help swiftly identify malicious cyber intrusion.\n", "category": "Altcoin News"}

Writing on Twitter, the former R3 executive related a recent exchange in which he was asked this same question.\n\u201cI know there are a lot of headline numbers out there but the undisputed answer is this: OTC service providers such as Cumberland (DRW), Jump, [and] Circle,\u201d Swanson replied, referencing three of the most prominent institutional cryptocurrency trading desks.\nThis may be surprising, as Circle is the only one of those firms that could be considered a household name \u2014 but it\u2019s known more for its mobile financial services products than its role as an over-the-counter (OTC) liquidity provider.\nThese institutional trading firms do not make their revenue figures available to the public, but they quietly handle billions of dollars in volume on a monthly basis. DRW Cumberland, which entered the cryptocurrency space in 2014, said last November that it had made $20 billion worth of trades over the previous year, while Circle Trade\u2019s website advertises that it processes more than $2 billion worth of trades per month.\nConsequently, they may not bring in as much gross revenue as Coinbase, which reportedly raked in more than $1 billion in 2017. However, Coinbase and other firms that target retail investors face have much greater overhead \u2014 and require much larger teams.\nIn December, a New York Times article said that Coinbase had 180 customer support specialists and that the company hoped to expand its customer support team to 400 by the end of the Q1 2018 \u2014 and these figures do not include the firm\u2019s other employees.\nProfessional trading desks, on the other hand, generally have small teams but still manage large amounts of capital. Jump\u2019s Bitcoin trading team is reportedly comprised of just 10 people. Cumberland, meanwhile, has a 15-person team spread throughout offices in Chicago, London, and Singapore to ensure that its desk operates around the clock.\nAdditionally, Coinbase and other retail-focused firms are constant targets for fraud, while institutional trading desks serve a smaller stable of KYC-compliant clients with much deeper pockets. Circle, for instance, lists its minimum order size as $250,000.\nBecause of these factors, Swanson estimated that these trading desks bring in between $30 million to $40 million worth of revenue per employee, making them the burgeoning industry\u2019s true cash cows.", "category": "Bitcoin Companies"}

The company has since corrected customer balances, although it said that is still trying to sort the matter out with one of the traders, who apparently attempted to transfer the coins out of the exchange following the transaction.\nThe glitch caused the system to temporarily report inaccurate trading data but otherwise had no effect on the platform\u2019s other users.\n\u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience and inconvenience caused to you by our customers,\u201d the company said in the statement, according to a rough translation. \u201cWe will strive to prevent recurrence and we will continue to work on improving our services.\u201d\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap, Zaif processed $17.3 million worth of trading volume over the preceding 24 hours, ranking it 51st among exchanges that charge trading fees.

The recipient of the cryptocurrency philanthropy was the\u00a0Internet Archive,\u00a0a nonprofit digital library aiming to provide \u201cuniversal access to all knowledge\u201d. It\u2019s 15 petabyte database includes three million books, as well as websites, software, film and other digital media. On top of its data storage, the archive is an activist organization campaigning for a free and open internet. They accept donations in a range of cryptocurrencies including; Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Zcash, and use crypto to pay employees.\nThis isn\u2019t the first instance of Vitalik\u2019s philanthropy. At the beginning of this month, the young developer donated $2.4m to Sens Research Foundation, a nonprofit which supports research projects at universities and institutes around the world aiming to tackle macular degeneration, heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nThe donations follow twitter announcements from the end of last year regarding the state of the cryptocurrency space. Buterin expressed concern with cryptocurrency communities, with many highly focused on individual wealth, and spoke of the need to affect real-world change and positively impact upon people\u2019s lives.\n\n*All* crypto communities, ethereum included, should heed these words of warning.

The right direction, in Buterin\u2019s eyes, is a socially progressive movement that would positively impact the lives of millions of people around the world. Some insight on how Vitalik believes the crypto space can positively impact society can be inferred from his twitter posts on 13th December, the day the total crypto market cap breached half a trillion dollars.\n\nHow many Venezuelans have actually been protected by us from hyperinflation?\n\u2014 Vitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin) December 13, 2017\n\n\nHow much censorship-resistant commerce for the common people have we enabled?\n\u2014 Vitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin) December 13, 2017\n\nIt\u2019s a vision where cryptocurrencies replace fiat systems \u2013 providing access to banking and financial services for the worlds poorest, and a sanctuary from oppressive government regimes. In this vision working dApps provide essential services, stimulating global commerce and equality. Vitalik\u2019s goal for the crypto space is a reminder of what an early stage we\u2019re at. Now, as Buterin notes, most crypto valuations are purely speculative. When scalability issues are solved however, it\u2019s possible that the first working dApps will launch on the Ethereum network with the ability to affect real change. The\u00a0donations come as a reminder of the true potential of cryptocurrency, and they may act as a positive example, encouraging others to turn to cryptocurrency philanthropy.", "category": "Ethereum News"}

So, you could have standards at the exchange level, but the underlying concept of a distributed ledger cryptocurrency becomes very difficult to regulated.\u201d\nSchweikert\u2019s comments come as congressional lawmakers appear to be cultivating a bipartisan appetite to regulate cryptocurrency at the federal level. No legislation has yet been proposed, but even the generally anti-regulation House Freedom Caucus appears to be on board with the idea that the government should at least consider new federal regulations on the nascent industry.\nAt present, cryptocurrency exchanges are primarily regulated at the state level, where they face a mishmash of rules that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Federal regulators from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have expressed at recent congressional hearings that it may be wise to regulate exchanges at the federal level in the future. However, they cautioned that such regulations should be \u201ccarefully tailored\u201d to address the perceived problems in the spot markets without stifling innovation.\nMeanwhile, Schweikert\u2019s home state of Arizona is considering legislation that would help legitimize Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment mechanisms. SB 1091, which has been passed by the Senate and was introduced into the House on Monday, would allow Arizona residents to use cryptocurrencies to pay their state income taxes. The state would receive the payments in cryptocurrency form and then convert them into fiat within 24 hours.", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

Taylor said having no way to open the vault ensures its privacy.\nVersaBank is responding to the need for digital security, an area which is calling for attention given the recent heist of more than $500 million from Coincheck Inc., a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange. Hackers usually gain access to cryptocurrency exchanges through their Internet connected wallets.\nTaylor said large funds have indicated an interest in storing their assets in VersaVault since it was announced last month. The pricing for the service has not been determined, but Taylor said the service will be expensive.\nSeveral U.S. banks have said they are halting cryptocurrency purchases on credit cards, citing security concerns.\nDigital Asset Security Efforts\nVersaBank is not the first company to respond to the need for digital asset security.\nXapo Inc. has offered secure bitcoin storage for around four years.\nGoldmoney Inc., a Toronto-based firm that allows clients buy, sell and store precious metals in vaults in seven countries, began offering bitcoin storage in September.\nShinhan Bank in South Korea said in November that it intends to build a bitcoin vault by midyear.\nA Banking Pioneer\nTaylor introduced a branchless bank in Canada in 1993, four years before ING Groep NV offered telephone banking as ING Direct.\nVersaBank operates on a branchless electronic model, gathering deposits from brokers and buying loan and lease receivables from non-bank financial firms.

The device identifies an integrity symbol within a physical document and converts it to a map that allows the device to verify the document\u2019s integrity.\nSource: U.S. Trademark & Patent Office\nThe application, number 20180046889, published Feb. 15, 2018, was filed Aug. 1, 2016 by Lenovo Pte. Ltd. of Singapore. The inventors listed include Robert James Kapinos of Durham, N.C., Timothy Winthrop Kingsbury of Cary, N.C., Scott Wentao Li of Cary, N.C., Russell Speight VanBlon of Raleigh, N.C.\nThe electronic device includes an imager that creates a digital image of the document. The device contains a processor, memory, document integrity module, input device with an imager and an output device with a printer.\nAddressing A Need\nThe filing notes that businesses have not widely embraced digital signatures on account of the technological complexity and the lack of a widely accepted standard. When a paper document gets signed physically in ink and then scanned, faxed or emailed, there is no assurance that the text wasn\u2019t altered after the document was signed, the filing notes.\nDigital signature technologies currently do not provide tamper-proof mechanisms for verifying documents printed with ink, the filing notes.\nThe embodiments for the device can take the form entirely of hardware, entirely of software or a combination of both.\nThe storage device can include an electrical connection; a portable computer diskette; a hard disk; a random access memory; a read-only memory; an erasable, programmable, read-only memory; a portable, compact disc, read-only memory; an optical storage device; a magnetic storage device; or any combination of the foregoing.\nAlso read: Official: Arizona law recognizes blockchain signatures and smart contracts\nCryptographic Hash Deployed\nTo ensure the integrity of a physical document, a cryptographic hash is taken of areas in the document that contains content, the filing notes. A table such as a hash table is formed containing the cryptographic hashes corresponding to the physical document. Areas of the document can then be changed and are included in a hash table. The table is converted to a printable form and included in the document. The printable form encodes the integrity map into a format that can be scanned in and used to verify the integrity of the document.\nWhen the document is printed and scanned, the integrity symbol is decoded to obtain the integrity map. The content can then be compared to the integrity map to verify that no changes were made since printing the integrity symbol.\nIn one implementation, a new integrity map is created by computing cryptographic hashes of the same areas as the printed document. If it is not compatible with the scanned-in integrity map, the document has been modified.\nThe authenticity of any electronic or printed version can be checked by examining the in-brand integrity symbol.\nThe filing includes an extensive explanation of embodiments and a detailed description of the functional units and features.", "category": "FinTech News"}

Several insurers have decided to venture into offering insurance covers for different companies dealing with cryptocurrency.\nThe risks involved are quite high, but the market is ripe for insurance firms to offer their services. For instance, last week on Friday Coincheck ,a company\u00a0 in Tokyo was the recent victim of hacking with coins worth $534 million being stolen. Such incidence will be a thing of the past with insurance industry offering covers for digital trading companies.\nInsurance Firms Offering Packages\nSome of the companies offering insurance coverage in cryptocurrency include Great American Insurance Group,\u00a0XL Catlin, Chubb, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance among others. These companies offer different insurance packages to their clients. For instance, the latter insurance firm insurance package takes care of not only internal but also external threats. The cover also includes mistakes; unauthorized access, and employee theft. The packages range from ten million yen up to one billion yen equivalent to $88,500 and $8,850,000 respectively. In addition to the package, the cover comes with other services which help in preventing such case. The firm provides security diagnosis and checks employer background before employment in the company. The preventive measures are in place to mitigate loses which may occur.\nAnother company that recently launched its insurance services in the cryptocurrency trading is Line . Line is a messaging app based in Japan that has announced its venture into digital currency with plans already underway. Although Line is a messaging app, it has created a new division which will offer a platform for its users to sell and buy bitcoin. The platform will also offer loans and insurance covers to its users. The firm has millions of users who are the target market for the insurance and loans.\nApart from the above, another firm offering insurance covers to merchants and retailers who accept bitcoin as payment is bitFlyer, which offers packages for any payment transaction associated with bitcoin in Japan. The merchants will be covered from transaction delays, mishaps with payment system or gateway issues. The cover will be offered to people who have the point of sale systems offered by bitFyler exchange through Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance firm.\nChallenges to Insurance Firms\nInsurance companies are doing their best to cover all the cryptocurrency trading companies, but the firms have first to invest in good security features to reduce cases of fraud. With trading taking place online, scammers are also on the rise.\u00a0 Many have set up shady companies which pretend to be dealing in cryptocurrencies, yet they are after stealing from investors.\nSimilarly,\u00a0 insurance firms should come up with good mechanisms for doing due diligence to companies before offering their insurance covers to prevent covering shady companies which are after stealing from investors.\nBottom Line\nThe insurance industry decision to venture into cryptocurrencies market is a good venture which will enable them to reap the profits. But the venture also exposes the insurance firms to uncertain challenges associated with fraud and money laundering which are serious offenses. Insurance companies have to do due diligence before offering their covers to the companies. It will enable the companies to offer covers for legit firms and avoid any company associated with money laundering.\nMore insurance companies are also planning to offer their services to the cryptocurrency trading companies which will enable competitive offers to be readily available for the traders and investors.", "category": "Bitcoin Services"}

It is also hoped that the system will make online transactions more convenient, faster and more efficient for end-users.\nOmiseGO founder Jun Hasegawa took to Twitter following the announcement, focusing on the positive impact blockchain technology could have on Thai citizens.\n\nHappy to see more collaboration between governments as Thailand.Also we are always happy to cooperate and help change peoples daily lives better with decentralization. #OmiseGO #Ethereum #Thailand pic.twitter.com/Wil0tJKPPK\n\u2014 JUN\u039e (@JUN_Omise) February 19, 2018\n\nWhilst the news could indicate the first mainstream use-case for a blockchain, questions still remain regarding the technology\u2019s ability to scale to this size. Currently , very action on the Ethereum blockchain must undergo a confirmation process, and the system cannot process the amount of work that a nation-wide platform would demand. OmiseGo has been working with Ethereum developers tackling exactly this problem, aiming to approach the issue with solutions such as Plasma.\nLast week OmiseGO was also involved in the launch of the Ethereum Community Fund. The Fund, a collaborative effort between projects building on the Ethereum network, is aiming to streamline research and development tackling the scalability issue. It\u2019s a sign that development is ramping up, with the prospect of mainstream adoption becoming more tangible as blockchain technology grows increasingly popular. Whether the Ethereum network can match the high expectations blockchain-enthusiasts have set remains to be seen, but it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll find out this year.\nGovernments across the globe are weighing up the benefits of blockchain technology, with national cryptocurrencies being considered from\u00a0Senegal to Scotland. Whilst the advantages of state cryptocurrencies are considered, this implementation of blockchain technology will likely take several years. Partnerships such as today\u2019s announcement however could see blockchain integration much more quickly. Digital identity verification is a central concern for governments, who are worried that cryptocurrency offers a way for individuals to circumvent financial legislation. Omise\u2019s cooperation with Thai officials in this area may see it leap ahead of rival platforms, and if the infrastructure can support it, gain mainstream adoption.", "category": "Blockchain News"}

Blockchain and distributed ledger technology have the potential to transform the delivery of public and private services, redefine the relationship between government and the citizen in terms of data sharing, transparency and trust, and make a leading contribution to the State\u2019s digital transformation.\nAlso, by implementing this technology, it would save the state millions, which benefits everyone in the state, because\u2014if you were not aware\u2014Illinois is one of the most broke states in the United States\u2014saving some money helps the government as well as the taxpayer.\nTitle Transfer, Property Information Management \nKaren A. Yarbrough, the recorder of deeds, announced in September 2016 that the office would participate in a piolet program to test blockchain technologies. According to the report put out by the recorder\u2019s office, a transition into the technology would not happen overnight, due to the complexity of how real estate is transacted over more than five government offices. Suggestions include: reducing public records down to plain-text date inputs and a permanent hash value of the sales contract file. This ensures consistency across the system and that the records appear the same statewide. By using standard data and parcel-numbering formats, this removes many the steps of having to contact five government agencies to learn about properties and further streamlines process for people to trade real estate. The CCRD\u2019s website also states the following about their interest in adopting blockchain:\nGoals:\n\nUse blockchain technology in a way that provides value (not an invented use case)\nTest the creation of digital property abstracts and demonstrate the value of consolidating property data\nSecure official records on a third-party (non-government) website and enhance their reputability\n\nCCRD Is Interested In Blockchain Because:\n\nIt is the most secure form of chronological record-keeping available\nThe transactional record is irreversible and impenetrable to hackers\nIt will drastically increase government efficiency\nReal estate transactions have become too complex \u2013 this will simplify\nIt is too easy to steal a house under current pre-blockchain structure\nWill lead to a paperless public record of property transactions\nAdoption will make Illinois a technology leader + investment center\n\nThe Cook County Recorder of\u00a0Deeds is one of the largest land records offices in the United States.

The pilot alone is said to save the agency $150,000 a month while eliminating a staggering 98% of bank-related transfer fees, according to Munich WFP innovation lab chief Bernhard Kowatsch.\nBeyond money transfers, the implementation of blockchain technology enabled Syrian refugees to buy food from local retailers using a biometric scan of their eye wherein each transaction is recorded on a blockchain. The use of cash, bank cards or paper vouchers is rendered obsolete as refugees needn\u2019t share any sensitive data with banks or mobile operators. Instead, refugees benefit from greater security and privacy through an immutable, secure blockchain.\nNow, the UN agency \u2013 feeding over 100 million people across 80 countries \u2013 is expanding its Ethereum-based blockchain platform after estimating savings of millions of dollars in bank transfer fees by utilizing decentralized blockchain technology.\nSpeaking to Bloomberg, UN WFP director Robert Opp stated:\n\u201cWe felt we could replace the services offered by banks with blockchain. Blockchain helps promote collaboration by providing enormous amounts of data.\u201d\nThe WFP has an annual budget of $6 billion and distributes about $1.4 billion in food vouchers and digital entitlements every year, Opp said. While not detailing specifics of the agency\u2019s plans to further its use of blockchain technology, the director was quoted as stating:\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting in place a financial infrastructure.\u201d\nBeyond its usage in cash transfers, identity management and (food) supply chain operations, the WFP has previously stated it is researching applications of blockchain technology in other areas. \u201cThe full potential of blockchains can only be realized if all humanitarian actors collaborate around this platform\u201d the WFP said in March 2017.\nOther humanitarian efforts benefiting from blockchain innovation include India\u2019s \u2018Million Meals\u2019 \u2013 the world\u2019s largest midday school meal program that caters to over 1.6 million children in the country, using the decentralized technology for a number of critical processes in the food supply chain, data gathering and more.", "category": "Blockchain News"}

In a one-two punch to the\u00a0US Fed, the Wyoming Senate Bill 111 was introduced on Feb. 16, moving to exempt cryptocurrencies from property taxation, solidifying the state\u2019s business tax-friendly reputation and lifting its profile for blockchain businesses in the interim.\nIf the bill passes, not only would it be a boon for Wyoming\u2019s economy, benefiting both individual investors and blockchain startups that would land there,\u00a0but it could inspire other US states to similarly remove any hurdles that would interfere with the proliferation of the cryptocurrency market.\nWyoming is already one of a handful of US states that don\u2019t charge income tax. By taking a similar approach with cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s likely to fuel a blockchain-fueled economic boom that\u2019s already begun to unfold in the state. The IRS, meanwhile, classifies bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as property\u00a0and taxes them accordingly. Wyoming would ostensibly be removing one layer of taxation for investors, including both individuals and businesses.\nThe bill, which is being sponsored by half-a-dozen Republican Senators and Representatives, includes virtual currencies among a list of other intangible items that \u201cshall be exempt from property taxation\u201d as soon as the bill becomes law. It defines virtual currencies as \u201cany type of digital representation of value that is 1.) used as a medium of exchange, unit of account or store of value, and 2.) is not recognized as legal tender by the US government.\u201d\nIn addition to cryptocurrencies, the bill also extends to \u201cmoney and cash on hand including currency, gold, silver and other coin, bank drafts, certified checks and cashier\u2019s checks.\u201d\nBlockchain Friendly States\nWyoming Senate Bill 111 would draw even more blockchain startups, which is the idea as cryptocurrency-friendly states jockey for position in the market. Wyoming is a big coal producer and boasts low electricity rates, which is a draw for bitcoin-mining operations.\nEven before Wyoming Senate Bill 111, blockchain startups were flocking to the state, including Canadian-based BlockCrushr, which added a corporate subsidiary there. In addition to Senate Bill 111, Wyoming is also pushing Bill HB0070, which would pave the way for digital tokens on an open blockchain from being subject to the state\u2019s securities and money transmission laws.\nSouth of Wyoming, the Arizona Senate earlier this month passed a bill\u00a0to\u00a0allow locals to pay income taxes in bitcoin and certain altcoins.

As CCN noted in the past, because the market tends to follow the trend of bitcoin in terms of massive volatility, over the past 24 hours, most cryptocurrencies have followed bitcoin\u2019s upward momentum.\nSince yesterday, the price of bitcoin rose from $8,840 to $9,900, by more than $1,000 overnight. The daily trading volume of bitcoin across large cryptocurrency exchanges remain solid, and short-term momentum indicators such as moving average convergence divergence (MACD) demonstrates strong short-term momentum for bitcoin. \n\nEver since a massive buy volume was recorded at the $8,800 range, the bitcoin price has shown strong momentum with large buy volumes. The keyword \u201cbuy bitcoin\u201d has also started to increase on platforms and search engines like Google. Since February 14, the keyword \u201cbuy bitcoin\u201d increased from 26 points to 44 points, by nearly two-fold.\nEther, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, has more or less been following the short-term price trend of bitcoin. As the price of bitcoin broke the $9,800 mark, Ether surpassed $950, indicating strong momentum. The $1,000 mark is also a psychological threshold for Ether, and given that Ethereum\u2019s all-time high is $1,400, if Ether can surpass $1,000 over the next few days, it will gain momentum to rally towards its all-time high in the mid-term.\nBased on the daily trading volumes of both bitcoin and Ethereum, it is entirely possible that bitcoin could reach $10,000 within the next 24 hours. A major correction at this stage is also unlikely, unless a massive sell-off occurs on February 16, during Chinese new year. Although historically, the market has seen some minor corrections during the Chinese new year, because it had experienced a major correction earlier in January, it is unlikely that the Chinese new year will largely affect the market.\nLitecoin Surges 30%\nLitecoin has been the fourth best performing cryptocurrency in the market, behind small-scale tokens like WAX and Nebilo. Litecoin recorded a 30 percent increase in value, overtaking Cardano to become the fifth largest cryptocurrency in the market for the first time since early January.\n\nSeveral reports suggested that Litecoin\u2019s value has surged due to an upcoming hard fork. Litecoin Cash, which has been criticizd by the community, will be rewarded to every Litecoin holder prior to block 1371111. \nWhile the hard fork may encourage users to purchase Litecoin to obtain free Litecoin Cash, many other major factors have contributed to the recent surge of Litecoin.

During major corrections or market instability, acquisition of debt to invest in the market can lead to financial problems, especially if investors are in need of money in the short-term and unable to cash out or spend.\nBut, in an interview with Quartz, law firm TRA managing partner Anirudh Rastogi stated that even if the government tries to justify the decision to prohibit credit and debit card usage in cryptocurrency investment as risk mitigation, it is unjustifiable.\n\u201cEven if banks were to justify this as necessary to mitigate their risk, I would find such a view to be very conservative and unjustifiable, which leads me to think that this is arm-twisting,\u201d said Rastogi, who oversees several cryptocurrency businesses at TRA.\nShort-Term Trend\nEarlier this month, almost immediately after unverified reports about cryptocurrency trading ban in India were released, local cryptocurrency exchanges Zebpay, Coinsecure, and Unocoin, which have over a million users on their platforms, reaffirmed that the government\u2019s stance towards the local cryptocurrency exchange market has not changed, and it remains neutral.\nThe government is yet to release a statement regarding the long-term future of the Indian cryptocurrency exchange market and until then, it is not possible to speculate the regulatory trend of the Indian cryptocurrency market.", "category": "Banking"}

The objective of the PoC is to replicate interbank clearing and settlement on a DLT which will allow the SARB and industry to jointly assess the potential benefits and risks of DLTs.\u201d\nThe development to explore blockchain technology comes despite statements to the contrary by the central bank\u2019s deputy governor who claimed the issuance of a blockchain-enabled central bank cryptocurrency would be \u201ctoo risky\u201d, in August 2017.\nThe SARB also plans to issue its own digital token to power its interbank settlement PoC, similar to its counterpart in Singapore. The Asian nation\u2019s own blockchain endeavor, Project Ubin, saw the central bank tokenize a Singaporean dollar as the digital token to fuel its interbank blockchain concept, also based on Ethereum.\nThe SARB insists the PoC project does not directly imply a major pivot to adopting a blockchain as the core technology powering the country\u2019s national payments infrastructure. Instead, the practical experiment will help understand the implications of \u2018using a tokenized asset\u2019 on a blockchain to transfer value, the central bank added.\nA public report in the aftermath of the PoC will be released in Q2 2018, the central bank added.", "category": "Blockchain News"}

Today, Litecoin\u2019s bullish advance continued, and LTC rose as high as $236 on Bitfinex, notching its highest mark since Jan. 15.\nAt the time of writing, Litecoin was trading at $219 and boasted a market cap of $12.4 billion.\nLTC Price Chart\nLitecoin\u2019s trading volume remains relatively decentralized, with no single exchange accounting for more than 16 percent of global LTC trading volume. Notably, LTC volume has surged on South Korean exchange Upbit, from about $62 million on Wednesday to $237 million today. Fellow Seoul-based exchange Bithumb experienced a comparable increase, and the two exchanges \u2014 each of which currently prices Litecoin at a five percent premium \u2014 now account for a combined 16.5 percent of LTC\u2019s daily trading volume.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nLitecoin Community Builds Out Infrastructure\nThe continued rally appears to be predicated on the assumption that increased LTC payments infrastructure will enable Litecoin to become the de facto cryptocurrency of choice for everyday transactions.\nAs CCN reported, LitePay \u2014 a payment processing firm modeled after industry giant BitPay \u2014 plans to launch on Feb. 26. LitePay claims that its products will provide both merchants and consumers with the ability to seamlessly send and receive LTC payments.\nAdditionally, Coinbase rolled out an upgraded merchant processing platform on Wednesday, which enables merchants to begin accepting cryptocurrency payments directly into a user-controlled wallet. The platform is compatible with the four cryptocurrencies currently supported by Coinbase, including Litecoin.\nHowever, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee reminded the community on Twitter that these are not the only major developments he believes Litecoin is slated to achieve this year. Hinting at insider information, he has also suggested that Litecoin will be added to a popular web wallet, be accepted at a \u201cgoods trading platform,\u201d and feature in \u201cone huge unexpected surprise.\u201d\n\n1 down, 3 to go!\n\u2705 Merchant processor @CommerceCB\ud83d\udd32 Popular online wallet \ud83d\udd32 Goods trading platform\ud83d\udd32 One huge unexpected surprise#PayWithLitecoin https://t.co/bYUPup67G0\n\u2014 Charlie Lee [LTC] (@SatoshiLite) February 14, 2018\n\nBut though infrastructure is likely playing a central role in the present rally, it is not the only factor buttressing the Litecoin price.

He discovered that his son had used Blockchain\u2019s web wallet, but this information did him little good without the decryption password or the wallet\u2019s private keys.\nThis, of course, is by design. One of the core philosophies behind the invention of cryptocurrency was the belief that individuals should retain complete control of their money, or, in common parlance, \u201cBe your own bank.\u201d\nCustodial \u201cwallets\u201d exist, but \u2014 by necessity \u2014 they require users to entrust their funds to a third-party. To cite another cryptocurrency proverb, \u201cNot your keys? Not your coins.\u201d\nDespite otherwise embracing this responsibility wholeheartedly, however, many cryptocurrency users neglect to consider how to pass their cryptoassets to their heirs. This is not entirely surprising. The largest share of cryptocurrency investors are millennials, and research indicates that fewer than 25 percent of millennials have wills.\nHowever, Pamela Morgan, an attorney who specializes in cryptocurrency, has written extensively about the need for investors to take steps to ensure that their heirs have access to their cryptoassets when they pass away.\n\u201c[W]ith self-controlled assets, ignoring our own mortality comes at a cost to our descendants, dependents, community groups, and political causes because our keys, and therefore access to the assets, could die with us,\u201d she wrote in a blog post last year. \u201cHumans die. Cryptocurrencies don\u2019t.\u201d\nMorgan, who is currently authoring a complete estate-planning guide for cryptocurrency investors, has published a handy \u201cLetter to Loved Ones\u201d template that investors can use to help heirs, including those without experience using cryptocurrency, access these assets and, if desired, liquidate them.\nThough not a substitute for a will or testament, this drafting one of these letters is an important first step toward ensuring that your heirs can access your investments after you pass away.", "category": "Bitcoin Education"}

Only Telegram\u2019s desktop app was targeted.\nThe attack is the latest case of an ongoing cryptojacking trend that recently saw hackers hijack millions of Android devices\u00a0to mine Monero. The trend seemingly picked up when popular torrent-index website The Pirate Bay experimented mining Monero with user\u2019s PCs as an alternative to running ads.\nPer the cybersecurity firm\u2019s report, hackers have been exploiting the vulnerability since March 2017. To infect users, cybercriminals took advantage of a feature that allows Telegram to recognize text in Arabic and Hebrew, languages written from right to left.\nHackers used a hidden character in the feature that reversed the order of the characters, effectively allowing them to rename files. This way, they tricked users into installing files with malware in it, that then used their computers to mine cryptocurrencies, and potentially gave them backdoor access to the victim\u2019s machine. In one case, researchers found archives containing a Telegram local cache stolen from a victim.\nThe post reads:\n\u201cAfter installation, it started to operate in a silent mode, which allowed the threat actor to remain unnoticed in the network and execute different commands including the further installation of spyware tools.\nKaspersky noted that the malicious software was only found in Russia, and that clues in the code pointed to Russian cybercriminals. It added that Telegram wasn\u2019t the only vulnerable messaging app, as last month it found an exploit in WhatsApp that allowed criminals to steal messages.\nThe Russian firm contacted Telegram on the issue back in October, and by November the problem was reportedly fixed. On a technical channel, Telegram clarified the attack was a form of social engineering, and that it only worked if the user downloaded the malicious file.\nPavel Durov, the company\u2019s founder, noted that this isn\u2019t a \u201creal vulnerability on Telegram Desktop,\u201d as no one can remotely access another user\u2019s computer or Telegram unless the file was opened. Per Durov, reports like these should be carefully examined.\n\u201cAs always, reports from antivirus companies must be taken a grain of salt, as they tend to exaggerate the severity of their findings to get publicity in mass media.\u201d\nAs covered by CCN, Telegram is working on a potentially record-setting ICO that could raise billions. The project aims to create \u201cGram,\u201d a cryptocurrency that will function as the native currency of the Telegram Open Network (TON), which will be integrated directly into the Telegram platform, which is set to hit 200 million users in the first quarter of this year.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The developers deduced this information from a BitGrail data dump, as the Nano protocol does not have timestamps.\u00a0They added that many of these funds made their way back to BitGrail and another exchange, indicating that the thief had likely already laundered the tokens and withdrawn the proceeds.\nAdditionally, the theft raised new questions about a policy change BitGrail had implemented in December, which required traders to undergo KYC verification before they could make sizable withdrawals. The exchange processed verification requests extremely slowly, with some users claiming to have been waiting in line for more than a month.\nFinally, BitGrail stopped processing XRB withdrawals altogether on Jan. 8, citing internal maintenance. Four days later, the exchange updated its KYC policy to apply to withdrawals of any size.\nThese events, Nano\u2019s developers noted, occurred at the same times as XRB was beginning to gain support on other exchanges, including KuCoin. The admission of insolvency, meanwhile, was made a week after exchange giants Binance and OKEx added XRB trading pairs.\nThis, understandably, has raised suspicions that users were attempting to withdraw tokens from BitGrail to trade on other exchanges, leaving the platform with no choice but to suspend withdrawals to hide its insolvency \u2014 which, of course, can only be done for so long.\nDespite these revelations, Firano and BitGrail continue to maintain their innocence, vowing that the exchange will reopen soon.\nCommunity members, meanwhile, have been reminded of a quotation, roughly translated from Italian, that was once featured on Firano\u2019s Twitter profile:\n\u201cYou either die a programmer, or you live long enough to become a scammer.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Crime"}

Decentralized exchange servers are distributed, which means their servers are spread out so that there is no risk of a server downtime.\nUnlike the traditional centralized system, this system uses an automatic peer-to-peer payment network with no central authority. The money is held by the owner only and safely stored in a wallet, protected by a unique key. Which makes it essentially a \u2018trustless system\u2019. If the money is held by the owner, there\u2019s no need to trust a third party. To add to this, disclosing a personal information is not required, as it usually happens with a centralized transaction. Anonymity is the DEX\u2019s key and its milestone.\nDecentralized system is also different from the centralized model in which users deposit their funds. When a user is about to withdraw the funds, these are converted back into the cryptocurrency they represent and sent to the owner. In a decentralized exchange, you can create an account and start trading right away.\nIf DEX are so brilliant, why don\u2019t they rule the market yet?\nTill now, \u00a0there were a few drawbacks of a current DEX system, that made the rise quite challenging. \n\nThe lack of liquidity compared to the more popular centralized exchanges. Unfortunately, there is no user support and poor UI which won\u2019t attract a mainstream user base\nSome decentralized exchanges require users to be online for an order to be listed by them and for a trade to take place, requiring users to perform certain actions like signaling that a payment was received.\nTrading features like margin trading, lending and stop loss are currently not available in the decentralized model, as they only allow the basic exchange of currency for a predetermined value.\nSometimes a transaction is declined by the network.\n\nAll ththesessues are seriously taken into account. As the whole blockchain industry develops rapidly and the demand increases day by day, experts are working hard over various solutions. \nGood news, however, is that there ARE solid DEX platforms out there. Here\u2019s a list of DEXs you should consider start using right now. \n\u00a0\n\n\nBancor Protocol\n\n\n\u00a0\nBancor created a unique Token Relay technology, which is basically a simple and ready-to-use online converter. Its aim is to address the liquidity challenge. If the ways in which consumers make transactions using cryptocurrencies could be unified and simplified, then it\u2019s not difficult to imagine that the demand for such assets would increase even more. \nAs of now, about 30 coins are available for converting and trading within the Bancor network \u2013 a Tokenbox (TBX) token included. \n\n Waves Dex\n\nIt\u2019s a decentralised exchange, which is based on the Waves blockchain technology. It allows users to trade their tokens \u2014 including WAVES, BTC and other assets issued on the Waves platform \u2014 completely trustlessly and without having to move the funds to a centralised exchange.\n\nOpenLedger Dex\n\nOpenLedger is a blockchain based company with a headquarters in Denmark. It provides decentralized solutions for the crypto market. OpenLedger Dex leverages BitShare\u2019s graphene technology to cater its services.\n\nCryptoBridge Dex\n\nCryptoBridge is a new entry in the decentralized crypto exchange markets. CryptoBridge is a decentralized exchange running on top of the BitShares Network. It supports decentralized trading of all popular altcoin pairs without a single point of failure. Only a user holds private keys to the funds and has access to them.\n\nBisq (aka BitSquare)\n\nBitsquare is a peer-to-peer marketplace for crypto assets. It is a fully decentralized exchange which requires no name, email ID or verification.\nTo be a truly anonymous peer-to-peer network, it uses Tor and doesn\u2019t hold fiat or bitcoins on their servers or on their account. Every aspect of this exchange is decentralized from placing an order to matching and executing it.\nWhy DEX could be the future?\nSurprisingly, all the projects listed above have entered the cryptocurrencies industry during the last 9-7 months. The market obviously has serious sentiments towards cryptocurrencies and other decentralized assets. \nAlso, the latest international regulation attempts, especially China\u2019s ban strategy and cautious South Korean policy, catalyze the need of developing DEXs more than ever.\nKeeping in mind all the current downsides, they are the only way that cryptocurrencies can survive and thrive. The kind of benefits that DEXs provide (gives the owner of the funds control, is anonymous, protects users against hacks and has no server downtime) will ultimately dwarf the shortcomings.\nAuthor: Vladimir Smerkis is the co-founder and managing partner of Tokenbox, unique ecosystem that combines cryptocurrency funds under the control of professional portfolio managers and traders on the one hand, and investors on the other.", "category": "Guest Contributor"}

Details about the trial were slim, but it seemed unlikely that XRP was involved given that most of Ripple\u2019s partners have connected to RippleNet, the company\u2019s private enterprise blockchain.\nHowever, Ripple later issued a statement to media outlets making it clear that Western Union will pilot Ripple\u2019s xRapid product, which uses XRP to provide real-time liquidity and reduce the capital requirements necessary for financial institutions to operate in emerging markets.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been testing different products with Western Union for a while,\u201d Ripple said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about our work towards a pilot implementation of xRapid, which uses XRP in payment flows.\u201d\nWestern Union CTO Sheri Rhodes told Yahoo Finance that the 167-year-old firm, which was first founded as a telegraph company, is interested in blockchain technology for a variety of reasons:\n\u201cWe continue to explore possible blockchain applications for our business, and we are piloting some settlement tests with Ripple for certain corridors. For blockchain in general, we\u2019re looking at areas such as transaction processing and settlement, working capital optimization, regulatory technology, and digital identity. We have a strong platform and system that work well today, but we continue to explore and test whether these technologies could potentially reduce costs and improve the customer experience,\u201d Rhodes said.\nWestern Union is the fifth prominent firm to test xRapid, a product that has proved much less popular than Ripple\u2019s enterprise blockchain, which has been trialed by more than 100 financial institutions located across the world.\nThat said, two of those five companies \u2014 Western Union and fellow money transfer giant MoneyGram \u2014 are among the biggest names in financial services, which will likely provide the nascent product with a strong vote of confidence as Ripple attempts to market it to commercial banks and other large firms.", "category": "Bitcoin Technology"}

Premiums in the South Korean cryptocurrency market have reemerged, and over the past 24 hours, bitcoin has been traded in the South Korean market with a 2 to 3 percent premium. At the time of reporting, on Bithumb, South Korea\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, bitcoin is being traded at $11,200.\nRelative to major markets like Japan and the US, the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market has significantly smaller supply of most cryptocurrencies. Hence, when the demand for bitcoin or other cryptocurrency spikes, premium rates tend to reemerge. The reappearance of premiums signal an increase in demand for cryptocurrencies by local investors, which is an optimistic indicator of short-term recovery, especially in the Asian market.\n\nThe daily trading volume of bitcoin across all major cryptocurrency exchanges has been stronger in the last 24 hours than any period in the past week, which demonstrates sufficient momentum to lead a short-term rally in the upcoming days. Several analysts have stated that if the price of bitcoin can surpass the $11,500 mark, it will carry its momentum towards the $13,000 region.\nEarlier this week, several mainstream media outlets in South Korea reported that many families have sent children and young adults bitcoin as the traditional lunar new year pocket money, instead of cash. Evidently, some instances of lunar new year pocket money payments with bitcoin did not contribute to the recent rally of bitcoin. But, a significant amount of positive press have come out due to such instances, and consequently, the demand for bitcoin within the local South Korean market has started to increase once again.\nEthereum et al.\nEthereum and the rest of major cryptocurrencies have more or less followed the price trend of bitcoin over the past week. Only a few cryptocurrencies such as NEO have outperformed bitcoin in the past 24 hours and the majority of cryptocurrencies have struggled to match the strong performance of bitcoin.\nMany ICO projects and tokens have increased in value due to some optimistic reports from Switzerland. This week, Swiss financial watchdog released a guideline on ICOs, with the intent of regulating ICOs with transparency. Given that most ICOs are based in Switzerland, the plan of the government to allow ICOs to be conducted in the future creates a better ecosystem for blockchain projects.\n\nPeter Todd, a Bitcoin Core developer and cryptocurrency expert, stated that if governments decide to regulate ICOs, they should strictly regulate ICOs that do not ostensibly seem harmful or bad, to ensure investors are protected.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Not because you did not search thoroughly, or because you couldn\u2019t find enough data. Rather, there\u2019s something increasingly more difficult to analyse than numbers and facts: people\u2019s feelings towards an event.\n\u2013disclaimer: my opinions and views are not financial advisement. I have personally invested in projects mentioned in this article\u2013\nThis article will be split into 3 different rounds, as I\u2019ll discuss different topics relating to emotion analysis.\nWithout further due let me tell you why I think emotion will triumph over reason. Every time.\nRound 1: historical technology hypes\nI have a thing for historical comparisons, although I don\u2019t think history repeats itself, it sure does have patterns and it does live in cycles. Ignoring what has happened in the not-so-distant past would be a fatal mistake. I\u2019m going to choose three different examples of bubbles, hypes and excitement periods that ultimately resulted in a crash; then I\u2019ll explain how emotion always triumphs over reason (hence, why people lose money). But before I can do that, let me ask you:\nDo you know the difference between smart and dumb money?\nSmart money is considered to be whale investors and institutions while dumb money is, well, people in general and small investors. What usually happens is what you\u2019re already thinking: smart money buys low and sells high, dumb money buys high and sell low. Now, on which group do you see yourself? Understanding where you are on the scale is the first step to making smarter decisions in the future. This definition is important to retain, as I will show you some examples of lots of dumb money being wiped out in a matter of hours or a few days.\nThe not so famous 3D printing bubble\nThere are many small bubbles that pass by without many ever noticing. One of those examples is 3D printing technology. Although nowadays you see more and more real applications for that technology, like creating artificial printed organs or 3D printed houses, do you know when the real investment hype was?\nhttps://www.engineering.com/3DPrinting/3DPrintingArticles/ArticleID/8293/Gartner-Despite-Hype-Consumer-Adoption-of-3DP-Will-Take-Time.aspx\nWhen there were limited use cases for that technology. Does this sound familiar? It should as the exact same thing is happening in the cryptocurrency market. There is hype (overvaluation) of a lot of companies that promise certain features. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to understand (1) the purpose of a company/technology and (2) what problems it does solve. For example, Santiment\u2019s purpose is to help investors making better, more informed decisions and the solution they propose is to enable machine learning, AI algorithms and sentiment analysis in a single platform, using the wisdom of the crowds. Santiment portfolio analysis, Sanfolio, can become essential in helping investors choosing which cryptocurrencies to buy, sell and hold.\nHow do you avoid getting slaughtered when entering the market?\nMy first piece of advice to any investor: look at the price. Even if it solves all world problems, ask yourself \u201cdo I think the price is fair?\u201d\nThe epic financial crash\nThis wouldn\u2019t be a proper example if I did not mention that time when smart money took one of the biggest hits of all times. The 2008 financial crash is the best example of why trusting other people with your money to make decisions for you, will always end up the same way:\nhttp://business.time.com/2013/12/17/one-chart-that-shows-just-how-much-global-stock-markets-are-booming/\nWith a huge BANG!\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s extremely important to differentiate between allowing other people to invest for you and allowing products and platforms to help you making better decisions. See, the later makes way more sense than the first. If you don\u2019t believe me try the following: grab any bill (the higher the face-value the better) and ask a friend: how would you spend this money if it was yours? Whatever the answer is, just give that person the money and see how they spend it.\nThis is a really poor example for the expression: put your money where your mouth is.\nMy second piece of advice to any investor: Never take advice from someone who has not put money on the asset they\u2019re advising you to buy.\nThe famous dot-com Bubble\nThe most common example folk tend to always speak about is the internet crash of 2001, when deciding the fate of cryptocurrencies. During this period the NASDAQ composite index peaked to more than 5000 points, crashing more than 78% over the next 30 months. It looked something like:\nhttps://news.gcase.org/2015/03/03/what-caused-the-nasdaq-internet-bubble-of-1999/\nMost money wiped out was dumb money, so small investors who did not want to miss the train. Look at what happened to them: so many lost so much.\nOf course if you just waited, let\u2019s say 10 or 15 years, assuming you had bet in some of the top 10 technology firms that did survive the crash, this is what could have happened:\nhttps://markets.ft.com/data/indices/tearsheet/summary?s=COMP:NAS\nEven if you had bought near the peak in 2001, 15 years later you could sell it for a hefty profit.\nThis is important to understand as many of the successful ICOs, which will survive future bloodbaths, already exist today. Considering the many different investment opportunities that will emerge, it\u2019s key that investors have available a platform that helps them understanding the market\u2019s emotions as:\n\nMany investors will lose money, meaning, people will learn from mistakes and will likely search for tools that helps them making better and more informed decisions.\nMany ICOs will disappear, meaning investors want to understand what other investors think and feel about certain projects. Using the wisdom of crowds is a good way to understand the sentiment of the market.\n\nAll these crashes have one thing in common: dumb money entering the market when the price was too high and the company did not have enough purpose. All that happened due to emotion triumphing over reason: people did not want to miss the rocket ship to the moon.\nMy third and last piece of advice for this round: sentiment analysis is as important as technical analysis.The fate of your portfolio and earnings greatly depends on how much information you have available; never discard crowds\u2019 emotions towards an asset.", "category": "Bitcoin Economics"}

Speaking from Stanford, California, Draper, an early investor in Bitcoin and a victim of the infamous 2014 Mt. Gox hack, spoke to Bloomberg TV of his confidence in cryptocurrencies.\nDraper lost around 40,000 Bitcoins in the Mt. Gox hack, equivalent to roughly $250,000 at the time. He told Bloomberg TV that his initial response to the hack was that it would be the end of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\n\u201cI thought that\u2019s the end. It\u2019s too bad, because this was going to be the currency that was free and open and cross-border and global\u2026\u201d\nAmid the turmoil surrounding the Mt. Gox hack, Draper\u2019s foresight and intuition at the time proved remarkable. Despite losing a quarter of a million dollars himself, he noted that \u201cBitcoin only dropped about ten percent on the news that Mt. Gox, the biggest exchange in Bitcoin basically stole or lost\u2026 all that Bitcoin.\u201d To Draper, Bitcoin\u2019s resilience in the face of the major disruption the Mt. Gox hack presented it, \u201cmeant the world needs this.\u201d\nWhen pressed as to the possibility of Bitcoin potentially falling back below $1,000 from the current price around $9,000, Draper was unfazed. Acknowledging volatility in currency markets but arguing the chances of a such a fall were unlikely, the venture capitalist spun the question around. Was Bitcoin volatile against fiat currencies or were fiat currencies volatile against Bitcoin?\n\u201cBitcoin is the future currency,\u201d he said, \u201cWhy would I sell the future for the past? Why would I go grab some weird fiat thing that\u2019s subject to the whims of some government?\u201d \nAs for Bitcoin\u2019s upside, Draper argued that \u201cthe world market for currency is $86 trillion. I think that will be crypto. I think a very large portion of that will be crypto.\u201d\nDraper speaks almost of a new world order created by Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency technology, generally). \u201cThe unbanked are bankable through Bitcoin,\u201d he asserts, with banking regulations making it unfeasible for banks to open accounts for those without sufficient cash. The unbanked, Draper insists, represent half of the world\u2019s population.\nOn the question of security, given the history of exchanges being hacked and cryptocurrencies being stolen, Draper stood firm. \u201cMy Bitcoin is more secure than my dollars in the banks.\u201d The blockchain has not been hacked, he argues, whereas banks have been \u201cover and over\u201d.\nTim Draper is a third-generation venture capitalist, steeped in old money pedigree. He has established a university in Silicon Valley focusing on preparing startups to approach venture capital firms. But if his university is an indicator of Draper\u2019s stance on cryptocurrency, he is extremely bullish on the new asset class. Draper University has recently added a new course to its curriculum \u2013 an intensive course on blockchain technology, set to launch in April. \u00a0\u00a0", "category": "News"}

Initially, Kim moved 980 Litecoins to his personal wallet, deceiving his superiors at the company that he had transferred the Litecoins as a security measure.\nIn November, two months after Kim had moved into the cryptocurrency trading department of the company, Kim moved 55 bitcoins to his personal wallet without the authorization of the company. At the time, Kim told the company that he had taken a necessary approach to unblock the company\u2019s cryptocurrency exchange account by transferring $433,000 worth of bitcoin to his personal wallet. \nAlthough Kim had moved back 27 bitcoins back to the account of the company, 28 bitcoins remained in the personal wallet of Kim.\nHowever, prosecutors of the case claimed that Kim stole more bitcoins than the amount he claimed to the company. The official criminal complaint noted that Kim stole 284 bitcoins at one point, an amount equivalent to $2.8 million. Bloomberg reported that Kim eventually returned 102 bitcoins he moved from the wallet of the company.\nA serious problem emerged when Kim decided to gamble with the company\u2019s funds stored in cryptocurrencies. After moving hundreds of bitcoins without authorization to his personal accounts, it was revealed that Kim engaged in personal trading, executing margin orders. Margin calls often provide high risk and high return trading opportunities. Because traders are required to risk a certain amount of bitcoin in placing a margin call, usually, traders do not risk large amounts of funds in margin calls.\nThe report claimed that Kim engaged in large-scale margin trading, and inevitably lost large amounts of bitcoin stolen from the Chicago-based company. While the company was able to recover $1.4 million from the personal wallet of Kim, the company could not recover the remaining $603,000.\nIn the beginning, Kim admitted that he wanted to generate profits by risking small funds. But, as he continued to lose more funds through high risk trading, he placed larger high risk bets, eventually losing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin of the company.\n\u201cIt was not my intention to steal for myself. I was perversely trying to fix what I had already done. I can\u2019t believe I did not stop,\u201d Kim told the prosecutors.\nHigh Risk Trades\nIt is important to acknowledge that high risk margin trading within the cryptocurrency market can lead to two drastic outcomes: a massive gain or a massive loss. Most traders struggle to deal with the initial loss and are tempted to initiate in more high risk trades to cover their losses. Ultimately, this type of trading method can lead to significant losses, especially if the initial amount used in margin trading is large.\nPreviously, Cornell professor Emin Gun Sirer encouraged traders within the cryptocurrency market to be wary of individuals that see easy answers regarding the short-term trend of cryptocurrencies in charts, as many factors contribute to the price trend of cryptocurrencies.\n\u201cBe wary of anyone who has an explanation. Disregard everyone who finds easy answers in charts. Ignore idiots with undergrad econonomics degrees who try to pass themselves as experts. And definitely let the trader/loser crowd inhabit basements, where they periodically get wiped/rekt,\u201d said Sirer.\nIn a higly volatile market like the cryptocurrency market, it is crucial to understand the high risk in short-term trades, analyze the potential outcomes of the trades, and make cautious decisions.", "category": "News"}

An investigation by FCC discovered that a bitcoin miner, Bitmain\u2019s Antminer s5 Bitcoin Miner to be specific, interfered with the LTE network of T-Mobile.\n\u201cOn November 30, 2017, in response to the complaint agents from the Enforcement Bureau\u2019s New York Office confirmed by direction finding techniques that radio emissions in the 700 MHz band were emanating from your residence in Brooklyn, New York. When the interfering device was turned off the interference ceased. You identified the device as an Antminer s5 Bitcoin Miner. The device was generating spurious emissions on frequencies assigned to T-Mobile\u2019s broadband network and causing harmful interference,\u201d read the FCC\u2019s statement.\nThe FCC emphasized continuous interference with the telecom\u2019s mobile network through the utilization of bitcoin miners is against federal laws, and the failure to cease operations or prevent the device in question from emitting harmful radio emissions to the LTE network of T-Mobile is in violation of an FCC regulation.\n\u201cThe operator of a radio frequency device shall be required to cease operating the device upon notification by a Commission representative that the device is causing harmful interference. Operation shall not resume until the condition causing the harmful interference has been corrected,\u201d the FCC\u2019s document added, noting that the device can continue to operate if it stops harmful radio emission from affecting local networks.\nBitcoin Miners \nMost bitcoin mining facilities and centers are based in regions with cold climate and cheap sources of electricity. Miners tend to relocate to regions like Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Canada that abundant sources of renewable energy. Countries like Iceland that have virtually all of its electricity generated with hydroelectric power plants and solar power plants have cheap electricity readily available for bitcoin miners, that lead to a significant decrease in operating costs.\nMiners seldom base their operations in cities like New York, due to expensive land, resources, and electricity. New York is the sixth most expensive city in terms of real estate, on a per-square-foot basis. Hence, cryptocurrency miners do not normally based their operations or establish mining facilities in the state of New York.\nCases of mining facilities interfering with LTE and mobile networks of large-scale telecoms have not been reported in the past because the vast majority of mining facilities are not established in crowded cities or regions.\nIt is entirely possible that newer generation mining equipment and ASIC chips do not generate harmful emission that affect local networks. The device flagged by the FCC is the Antminer s4 of Bitmain, which was released in 2014. Bitmain, the company that produces the Antminer series, already released Antminer s9. \nCompetitors in the mining sector such as Halong Mining have also started to create more sophisticated mining equipment, that may reduce the likelihood of miners interfering with mobile networks.", "category": "News"}

The majority of alternative cryptocurrencies in the market have performed poorly against bitcoin, as the most dominant cryptocurrency in the market continued to lead a strong rally.\nAgainst the US dollar, bitcoin has increased by nearly 8 percent since February 17, achieving $11,200. Apart from a few small cryptocurrencies such as Aion, bitcoin has been the best performing major cryptocurrency in the market.\nEvery top 20 cryptocurrency in the global market has recorded a loss against bitcoin in the past 24 hours, with Ethereum\u2019s native cryptocurrency Ether demonstrating a 5 percent loss, Litecoin recording a 7 percent loss, and NEO recording nearly an 8 percent loss against bitcoin.\n\nThroughout January, the cryptocurrency market experienced one of the worst corrections in history, as most cryptocurrencies declined by around 70 percent from their all-time highs (ATHs). Since early February, the cryptocurrency market has continuously recovered, but major cryptocurrencies with robust infrastructures, community support, and network effect have had an edge over other alternative cryptocurrencies.\nDuring a recovery period, wherein new investors and traders enter the space as the market begins to see gains, cryptocurrencies with strong network effect such as bitcoin has a strong advantage over other alternative cryptocurrencies. Most investors who exited the market as the price of cryptocurrencies fell did it out of panic and fear.\nMost investors that are entering the space now are experiencing FOMO, or fear of missing out.

After rising about $20,000, this dip in price had seen the most popular cryptocurrency slump to almost $6,000 before rising again and then trading around the $8,400 region as at the time of writing.\nRising and falling, and rising again has been one of the usual characteristics of the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency price trend. However, probably due to the increased level of awareness and the literal monetary value of the current price dip, the anti-crypto campaigners found a reason to make loud their criticism of the technology.\nCryptos Have Been Predicted to Fail\nDelivering his speech in London on February 8 2018, Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB noted that the wild fluctuations in the value of virtual currencies (VCs) mean that businesses pricing in VCs could find themselves with a large and detrimental gap between their actual price and their optimal price. He explains that when there is considerable uncertainty around how many goods and services an asset can buy in the future, or indeed whether it can be used to purchase anything at all, the asset becomes a poor store of value.\nAnother form of criticism and negative prediction for Bitcoin has come from the popular billionaire investor, Warren Buffet.\nBuffet says that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are in a free fall, noting that he would never invest in any of them. He says:\n\u201cI can say almost with certainty that cryptocurrencies will come to a bad end\u201d.\nSome other critics have registered their opinions on the current dip in price of Bitcoin and altcoins, most of whom predict a bleak future for cryptocurrencies. However, the dilemma comes when some of them categorically condemn the idea of cryptocurrencies, but have a soft side for the underlying technology, blockchain. At this point, the question will arise if blockchain and cryptocurrencies can exist as separate entities, or whether it is possible for blockchain technology to thrive while the tokens upon which they are powered fail.\nCurrent crypto Behaviour is normal\nMichael Vogel, CEO of Netcoins does not share the opinion that the recent slump in price of Bitcoin and other altcoins signifies failure of the technology. Vogel notes that considering the developmental stage of cryptocurrencies, the volatility that is being experienced at the moment should be considered as normal.\nVogel says:\n\u201cI think for long term investors that bought one year ago or even six months ago, I\u2019d say they would be very happy with their return to date. Volatility is part of the crypto scene at the moment given that there are still years of growth ahead. 2015-2016 saw less volatility and thus more users were interested in using Bitcoin as a spendable currency in those days, however given how rapidly Bitcoin has surged in value I think it has made a lot of people realize the potential in Bitcoin as a store of value / digital equivalent to gold.\u201d\nVogel explains that pullbacks are part of a healthy trading and go against the notion of a crypto bubble, even as he insists that cryptocurrencies cannot be separated from Blockchain. \u201cDigital money has been attempted before, and the reason those attempts failed is due to not having the decentralization that blockchain offers\u201d, he says. \u201cBlockchain and cryptocurrencies are intimately connected, and both technologies are destined for massive success and impact akin to growth of the Internet itself\u201d.\nSome Technical Analysis\nKumar Gaurav of Auxesis Group however considers the technical price analysis as he explains the Bitcoin price behaviour in recent times. Gaurav explains that the recent pullback only came after the Bitcoin price reached the hockey stick growth stage which was frequently predicted in past due to the slightly parabolic growth throughout its history, and is now back again at a less drastic growth which is more in line with the past years. According to him, this that means Bitcoin has stored at least the same value for everyone who invested in it until just around 2 months ago.\nGaurav also notes that while in absolute terms this pullback is unprecedented which scared beginners or made sceptics feel confirmed, everyone familiar with the history of Bitcoin knows that in percentage terms it should not be a surprise at all and that it had in such situations always quickly recovered.\nBlockchain or Cryptocurrencies\nGaurav elaborates that the distinctive consideration of Cryptocurrencies and blockchain in most quarters should be seen neutral, not based on ideology but simply on legal and practicality reasons according to where a cryptocurrency is possible and needed and where not.\nIn government for example, blockchain technology has many use cases in which it can help achieve better efficiency and transparency, which do not have anything to do with cryptocurrencies. Recently, the Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley acknowledged blockchain\u2019s potential, stating that the Government will \u201cexplore the use of blockchain technology for ushering in digital economy\u201d.\nKumar explains that Auxledger, the largest private ledger with 54+ million users onboard already, resulting of Auxesis Group\u2019s work with the State Government of India has custom plugins for different sectors which allow companies to adopt faster based on their needs. These solutions include a Distributed Ledger Protocol for financial institutions, Benefit Distribution Program for government bodies, Darwinsurance for Insurance settlement; Genuinity, an anti-counterfeiting program for supply chain and Reservoir, which addresses issues of products availability.\nDespite these solutions, Gaurav explains that had it not been for cryptocurrencies, we may have never seen the ongoing blockchain involvement throughout the institutions, as it was what sparked everyone\u2019s interest, and also as it created the wealth enabling the ongoing innovations in the industry since its beginning, even before traditional investors came in.", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

They could either disable their ad-blocker to continue to view content\u00a0or opt-in to allow Salon to utilize their computer processing power to mine cryptocurrency. This is done using CoinHive\u2019s embeddable script on their website, which is a JavaScript miner for Monero.\nIn a blog post published the other day, Salon explains that diminishing ad revenue due to ad-blockers has led them to seek alternative means of monetizing their content. They also see the power in utilizing computer processing power over \u201creader\u2019s eyeballs\u201d for value-driven returns.\nSalon is mining digital currencies (for our beta, Monero).\u00a0 To do that, we are instructing your processor to run calculations.\u00a0 Think of it like borrowing your calculator for a few minutes to figure out the answer to math problems, then giving it back when you leave the site.\nPart of Salon\u2019s pitch also included a very blockchain-positive spin, in which they frame their initiative as a contribution \u201cto the advancement of technological discovery, evolution and innovation.\u201d They continue in the post to explain how the script is only leveraged on their website, and isn\u2019t active after the user leaves the site. They also mention that user privacy is fully protected in the process, and by utilizing a cryptocurrency miner, less information is taken from users as opposed to traditional web advertisements.\nThe Ethics of Implementing CoinHive\u2019s Script\nSalon has taken the more ethical route when implementing a cryptocurrency miner by allowing users to have the choice of whether or now they wish to disable their ad blocker, or lend their spare processing power to help secure the Monero network. Scandals in the past have mostly been driven by companies implementing CoinHive\u2019s script without first alerting users of whether or not their processing power is being borrowed for the sake of the website making a quick bit of money on the side.\nWhat originally drew attention to CoinHive was an experiment carried out by popular torrent index The Pirate Bay back in October when they were found to be using the script. Since then, malicious actors have leveraged the script in various forms of newly-named \u201ccryptojacking\u201d schemes, in which users are advertently duped into mining Monero for the propagators.\nHowever, it isn\u2019t just businesses that are leveraging CoinHive\u2019s script to cover operational costs \u2013 a few charities have begun to use it as well. Bail Bloc, a charity dedicated to ending domestic bail issues, CPU For Good which seeks to free enslaved individuals in Pakistan, and Mine For Charity have all implemented CoinHive scripts for their philanthropic ventures.\nThe approach Salon has taken has been quite transparent, and could be a great starting point for an ethical implementation of cryptocurrency miners on websites for revenue.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

ShapeShift stands by its offering to provide its API integration services for the wallet, but it also stands by its position to refer to bitcoin as bitcoin, and not Bitcoin Core.\nSome have criticized the marketing practices of Bitcoin.com regarding BCH.\nTwo days ago, ShapeShift announced that it has integrated its full API to support Bitcoin.com wallet user exchange between BTC and BCH and vice versa. It noted the Bitcoin.com wallet app became available in mid 2017 and more than 1.7 million wallets have been created on the platform.

The website clearly states that it supports both BTC and BCH.\nRoger Ver, who owns Bitcoin.com, applauded ShapeShift for making the exchange between BTC and BCH easy.

But they emphasized consumer protection without a heavy-handed ban on development of cryptocurrencies. In response, the jump in bitcoin\u2019s price marked a gain of more than $2,000 in just over a day.\nShortly before last week\u2019s hearing, bitcoin fell below $6,000 to $5,947.40, its lowest since Nov. 13, amid a plunge in U.S. stocks. Many observers held their breath as the committee hearing began, expecting calls for a government clampdown on cryptocurrency trading.\nBut instead of fear, cryptocurrency investors reacted with glee.\u00a0The day brought a 26 percent recovery to bitcoin, while Ethereum managed to achieve a 30 percent return. Altogether, the cryptocurrency market cap surged by $89 billion, a 24-hour increase of 29%. Bitcoin has since been inching upward, currently hovering around $9,000.\nRegulatory Issues Aren\u2019t Black And White\nWhile regulation is often seen as a negative by cryptocurrency enthusiasts, companies hoping to make money in this area have been looking for more guidance on cryptocurrencies. Yesterday\u2019s hearing indicates that time could be coming soon.\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo won the hearts of bitcoin enthusiasts with comments yesterday that appeared to be hat tips to the bitcoin community. Toward the end of the hearing, he contradicted the common misconception that bitcoin is riding the coattails of blockchain technology. He said that if there were no bitcoin, there would be no blockchain.\nLawyers who work with companies involved in cryptocurrency expressed optimism after last week\u2019s hearing, expecting that government involvement will bring thoughtful \u2013 as opposed to overly onerous \u2013 regulation, according to Barron\u2019s.\nBitcoin\u2019s Generational Impact\nComments by Giancarlo and another banking committee chairman, U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, D-Idaho, indicated the generational impact that bitcoin is having on some policymakers, as demonstrated in a Streamable video from the hearing.\nGiancarlo, the father of three college-aged children, said he tried to get his children interested in the financial markets at an early age, only to realize he was fighting a losing battle.\n\u201cSomething changed in the last year,\u201d he said. \u201cSuddenly they were all talking about bitcoin. They were asking me what I thought and should I buy it.\u201d\n\u201cIt strikes me that we owe it to this generation to respect their enthusiasm about virtual currencies, with a thoughtful and balanced response, not a dismissive one,\u201d he said.\nCrapo said he had similar conversations with his own children.\n\u201cThis is an incredibly interesting but growing new area of financial challenge, particularly among my children and yours,\u201d Crapo said.\nThe hearing touched on a broad range of regulatory concerns related to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, including ICOs, trading platforms, derivatives and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the assets\u2019 perceived use to perpetrate financial crimes and subvert international sanctions.\nThe chairmen also said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is bringing together several federal agencies to coordinate regulation of the fast-growing industry.\nAlso read: Bulls are back in town; cryptocurrency market cap achieves $89 billion recovery\nRegulatory Changes Needed\nBoth Clayton and Giancarlo expressed concern about the fact that cryptocurrency exchanges are currently regulated at the state level rather than the federal, and each reiterated that, at some undefined point in the future, Congress may want to increase federal regulators\u2019 ability to oversee the spot markets.\nClayton continually shifted the conversation back to ICOs, noting that he has not seen an ICO that should not be classified as a security under federal regulations.\nHe also provided insight into why the SEC has resisted fund sponsors\u2019 attempts to list bitcoin ETFs, explaining that because ETFs primarily target retail investors and are largely one-sided markets, rules governing their creation must be stricter than those for futures contracts, which are overseen by the CFTC. He said that if these rules are satisfied at a later date, the SEC will then be open to reviewing its stance on Bitcoin ETFs.\nWhile cryptocurrency was invented to prevent centralized control of currency, its mainstream acceptance largely depends on its ability to integrate with the existing financial ecosystem. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been urging the SEC to approve a bitcoin ETF. Such a vehicle would allow investors to trade in financial securities tied to bitcoins without necessarily owning bitcoins. SEC approval would bring massive amounts of financial resources to cryptocurrency.\nObservers have noted for some time that for a bitcoin ETF to be approved, the cryptocurrency will need a regulated ecosystem.\nThe cryptocurrency industry should not waste its opportunity to learn more about what U.S. regulators are thinking.", "category": "News"}

They are the most loyal followers of the product and the ones who display understanding and patience during the development. This audience is mainly represented by experienced cryptocurrency enthusiasts and analysts who read almost every message and monitor every reference in the media. They usually investigate all the issues on their own and sometimes share the answers with the others.\n\nA reseller\n\n\nThis user comes to projects with one aim: to buy low and sell high. He doesn\u2019t care what kind of product is under development, or what\u2019s the idea behind it, or who\u2019s on the team. He hardly ever reads Whitepaper.

Thoroughly research virtual currencies, digital coins, tokens, and the companies or entities behind them in order to separate hype from facts,\u201d the CFTC said.\nThe bulletin detailed how groups of traders orchestrate pump-and-dump schemes intended to manipulate the price of individual cryptocurrencies, often through the use of fraudulent tactics such as spreading inaccurate or misleading news reports on social media.\nThese scams, the CFTC explained, are not new, but they often take advantage of the hype surrounding nascent technologies.\n\u201cAs with many online frauds, this type of scam is not new \u2013 it simply deploys an emerging technology to capitalize on public interest in digital assets,\u201d said CFTC Director of Public Affairs Erica Elliott Richardson. \u201cPump-and-dump schemes long pre-date the invention of virtual currencies, and typically conjure the image of penny stock boiler rooms, but customers should know that these frauds have evolved and are prevalent online.\u201d\nIndeed, the prevalence of these pump-and-dump schemes \u2014 and the inability of many retail investors to identify them as such \u2014 is one reason that Facebook banned cryptocurrency-related advertisements across all of its platforms.\nThe bulletin adds that, under current US law, the CFTC cannot directly police the spot markets. However, it does have a mandate to investigate fraud and market manipulation, authority which extends to cryptocurrency exchanges.\nCFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo \u2014 who won the hearts of many cryptocurrency enthusiasts with his opening statement at a recent US Senate hearing \u2014 has advised legislators that any new federal regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges should be carefully tailored to address specific risks in the spot markets.\nRepublican CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz, meanwhile, has encouraged industry participants to adopt self-regulatory standards and best practices, even as legislators and regulators are considering whether the present state of the cryptocurrency markets warrants more formal oversight at the federal level.", "category": "News"}

The self-regulatory body will see the unification of the Japan Blockchain Association and the Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association. The former is notably founded around bitFlyer, Japan\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\nThe new entity aims to quickly enforce self-imposed rules surrounding the protection of exchange users\u2019 assets, system downtimes, insider trading and even advertising. Additionally, penalties for breaches will also be considered. All of which sums up to a transparent foray to foster confidence from the public and the conventional financial industry in the cryptocurrency space, particularly in the aftermath of a major hack.\nAccording to the report, talks toward a self-regulatory body were fast-tracked following last month\u2019s infamous hack of cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, now seen as the biggest cryptocurrency theft ever. A basic agreement toward the unified self-regulatory body on Thursday hinted at bitFlyer CEO Yuzo Kano becoming the body\u2019s vice-chairman at launch.\nUnder the revised Payment Services Act, Japanese exchanges are mandated to register with Japan\u2019s financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency, to acquire a special license before commencing operations. Exceptions are made for operational exchanges predating the new legislation. Coincheck is a notable example.\nThe new law also allows registered cryptocurrency exchange operators to form a voluntary self-regulatory body. However, the FSA reportedly refused to allow two separate self-regulatory bodies to operate, thereby leading to the upcoming and newly unified organization.", "category": "Exchanges"}

Whilst Yen withdrawals reopened on Tuesday, cryptocurrency withdrawals, leaving users in the lurch.\nThis week, seven affected investors publicly voiced their concern by filing a lawsuit at the Tokyo District Court, calling upon the exchange to reopen all withdrawals. They also demanded that Coincheck pay an annual 5 percent interest on the value of frozen funds (worth a reported $183,000 at the time) until it resumes withdrawals, Reuters reports.\nThe hack shook the crypto world last month and was described as \u201cthe biggest theft in the history of the world\u201d by Lon Wong, president of NEM.io Foundation. Revelations since the event have pointed the finger at poor security measures, with the exchange both failing to use multi-signature wallets and secure cold storage. Instead, all NEM funds were stored in a single hot-wallet, an online account that presented an easy target for the hackers. Only owners of XEM were affected, and Coincheck has since\u00a0promised\u00a0to repay the 260,000 users in full, with further details expected shortly. According to local Bloomberg source\u00a0Yuji Nakamura, the exchange will prioritize repaying users affected by the breach over reopening withdrawals for other cryptocurrencies.\nThe hack has drawn attention from officials in Japan, with the nation\u2019s Financial Security Agency reportedly inspecting other exchanges this week. It\u2019s a move that could prevent a second costly disaster, and comes as Taro Aso, Japanese Finance Minister lays out the groundwork of an approach that will:\n\u201c[A]ppropriately weigh the balance between promotion of innovation and protection of users in (supervising) cryptocurrency exchanges.\u201d\nWhilst no details have been announced regarding the identity of the Coincheck hackers, one individual has allegedly been questioned after attempting to trade a small amount of the stolen funds. After leaving the exchange, the stolen funds were split to multiple different wallets \u2013 which are all being monitored.

Although the price of bitcoin has dipped below $9,900 since achieving $10,000, unless sell volumes continue to rise in the upcoming hours, it is unlikely that the price of bitcoin will stay below the $10,000 mark in the short-term.\n\nThroughout the past 12 hours, the daily trading volume of bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies remained relatively low, in comparison to the market\u2019s volume on February 15. Bitcoin also demonstrated a massive sell volume earlier today, the biggest one yet since February 14. If bitcoin cam remain above the $9,700 mark, the starting point of February 14, it will likely soon rebound to $10,000 and potentially lead a strong rally.\nTom Lee, a Wall Street strategist at Fundstrat known for his mid and long-term bitcoin analysis, has stated that bitcoin will likely achieve new all-time highs by July of this year. Based on the v-shaped bottom of bitcoin, Lee noted that bitcoin will begin to show resilience and start to build some momentum throughout the mid-term.\n\u201cThis recent 70% decline is severe. We can see a case for Bitcoin\u2019s resilience here given the sharpness of the recent decline,\u201d said Lee, predicting bitcoin to achieve a new all-time high by July.\nEven at $10,000, bitcoin remains at below 53 percent from its all-time high established at $19,000. While most assets tend to struggle to recover in the short-term after 70 percent corrections, bitcoin has started to show early signs of mid-term recovery, as explained by Lee.\nAs a volatile currency, bitcoin declines by large margins but also increases rapidly in short periods of time. Hence, as bitcoin stabilizes above the $10,000 mark, as it did in throughout November and December, it is entirely possible that it will experience an exponential increase in value from $10,000 back to its all-time high at $19,000 in the upcoming months.\nEthereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash\nAfter recording a massive increase in value with a 30 percent surge, the price of Litecoin has declined slightly, by 8 percent. Ethereum has also struggled to demonstrate gains it recorded on February 15, as the price of Ether decreased by 2 percent.\nStill, Bitcoin Cash has seen an 8 percent increase within the past 24 hours, after surging by 30 percent last week. Bitcoin Cash has been the best performing major cryptocurrency, outside of 0x, which has enjoyed price spike due to the listing of Bittrex and South Korea\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency exchange UpBit.\nOverall, the market still remains optimistic, as bitcoin remains above $9,900 and other cryptocurrencies have not recorded large losses after a strong performance over the past two days. Premiums in the South Korean market have also reemerged, as the demand for cryptocurrencies from local investors have started to increase after a month-long bear market.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

And that\u2019s something that is a concern of ours today.\u201d\nOf course, even by the Treasury Department\u2019s own admission, cryptocurrency usage makes up a small percentage of illicit transaction volume. The currency most commonly associated with illicit transactions? \u2014 the US dollar.\nMeanwhile, regulators themselves have cautioned legislators against encumbering the nascent blockchain ecosystem with overbearing regulations. At a recent US Senate hearing, for instance, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo testified that any new Bitcoin regulations should be \u201ccarefully tailored\u201d to address specific problems found in the underlying markets.", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

Per the Financial Times, FINMA already received more than 100 requests for guidance.\nThe organization\u2019s press release starts by clarifying that financial market law and regulation aren\u2019t applicable to all ICOs, as some may not even be subject to regulatory requirements. As such, circumstances need to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.\nThe guidelines reveal that regulations will be based both on the purpose of the issued tokens, as well as whether the tokens are tradeable and transferable at the time of the ICO. Given that there\u2019s currently no recognized terminology for different types of tokens \u2013 both in Switzerland and in the rest of the world \u2013 FINMA identifies three different types, with hybrids forms being a possibility.\nFINMA\u2019s ICO token categories\nThe regulator goes on to reveal the three different ICO token categories. In the first category are \u201cpayment tokens,\u201d which are cryptocurrencies with \u201cno further functions or links to other development projects.\u201d These are essentially tokens that are to be used as a payment method.\nIn the second category are utility tokens, which will be used to provide digital access to a specific application or service. Finally, there are asset tokens, which represent assets in underlying companies or earning streams, or entitle their holders to dividends or interest payments.\nAs stated, the regulator will regulate ICOs under anti-money laundering laws, which require financial intermediaries to \u201cestablish the identity of beneficial owners,\u201d and as securities, in which case the regulator needs to ensure that market participants can base their investment decisions on a \u201creliable minimum set of information.\u201d Furthermore, the agency notes trading should fair and reliable.\nTaking this into account, FINMA reveals it will handle ICO inquiries according to three different categories, based on the type of tokens they\u2019ll be issuing.\n\nPayment ICOs (payment tokens): These will be those that issue tokens that are transferable and function as means of payment. They\u2019ll have to comply with anti-money laundering regulations, but won\u2019t be treated as securities.\nUtility ICOs (utility tokens): These will not qualify as securities, as long as their purpose is to confer digital access rights to an application or service. If a utility token functions as an investment in economic terms, it will be treated as a security.\nAsset ICOs (asset tokens): Tokens issued in these ICOs will be seen as securities. This means they\u2019ll be treated like equities or bonds if, for example, they pay holders dividends, or give them rights to earning streams. These will be subject to strict requirements.\n\nThe regulator further recognizes ICOs can be included in one or more of the above categories. As such, anti-money laundering laws can, for example, apply to asset ICOs. Commenting on the announcement, FINMA CEO Mark Branson stated:\n\u201cOur balanced approach to handling ICO projects and enquiries allows legitimate innovators to navigate the regulatory landscape and so launch their projects in a way consistent with our laws protecting investors and the integrity of the financial system.\u201d\nRegulators throughout the world are seemingly starting to support ICOs. As covered by CCN, the financial watchdog for Gibraltar recently announced it is developing legislation for blockchain-based token offerings in its territory. The Spanish government is reportedly also preparing legislation, which might notably include tax incentives to lure blockchain companies into the country.", "category": "ICO News"}

The cryptocurrency has been posting some recovery since falling 70% from its Dec. 18 high to its Feb. 6 low.\nLee, who urged caution during bitcoin\u2019s record \u201cbull run,\u201d said the cryptocurrency, now trading near $10,000, has established a pattern whereby its bottoms are \u201cV-shaped.\u201d He claims bitcoin has registered 22 corrections of 10% or more since 2010.\nRecovery Follows Bull Runs\nLee said that during bitcoin\u2019s \u201cbull\u201d periods, it takes 1.7 times the duration of a decline to recover. Based on that pattern, it will take 85 days for bitcoin to recover from its last plunge, which lasted for 50 days. If Lee\u2019s analysis is correct, bitcoin will set new records by midyear.\nInvestor sentiment towards bitcoin improved in recent weeks, demonstrating investor bullishness, Lee said.\nThe 70% drop was \u201csevere,\u201d he stated, but there is a case for its continued resilience. In late November, Lee urged investors to exercise caution following the bitcoin price\u2019s staggering advance during the first week of November.\nThe bitcoin price had risen to dizzying heights that week as bitcoin began to test the $7,500 mark for the first time in its history. At that time, bitcoin was up 25% for the week, nearly 75% for the month, and more than 700% for the year.\nIn late December, as the big decline set in, Lee raised his bitcoin price target from $11,500 to $20,000 for mid-2018.\nBull Run Was Driven By New Wallets\nLee said bull run was due to the growth of new bitcoin wallets, and that Fundsrat was buying bitcoin as the price was falling.\nFundstrat projected unique IP bitcoin wallet addresses would increase 50% by mid-2018 while user activity would rise 10% from late December levels. Lee raised his mid-2018 projection twice since late November, when he raised it from $6,000 to $11,500. He initiated the $6,000 projection in August.\nLee said $11,000 was becoming a support price for bitcoin. He said the next downward support levels would be $10,131, $7,918 and approximately $7,000.\nHe maintained his $25,000 bitcoin price target for 2022 based on the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) over-the-counter price moving from $1,300 to $2,200. GBTC\u2019s price jumped more than 1,500% to $1,900 in 2017.\nLee, who was J.P. Morgan Chase\u2019s chief equity strategist from 2007 to 2014 before helping to launch Fundstrat, became the first widely followed market strategist to focus on bitcoin\u2019s price back in July. He is now Fundstrat\u2019s managing partner and research head.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Hydro-Quebec revealed it may consider hiking the cost for bitcoin miners given a flood of pent-up demand in the region, which would thwart the plans of bitcoin miners who depend on low rates for the massive amounts of electricity it requires to power their operations.\nThe Canadian province has been inundated with requests from more than 100 mega bitcoin mining operations looking to set up shop there \u2014 a handful of which are already under way \u2014 to lock-in lower hydropower costs that have already lured the likes of Amazon.com for its data centers. But the local utility provider says not so fast.\nA Hydro-Quebec spokesman told CTV News Montreal:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had such an important volume (of requests) that there are questions being asked on the tariff offered and the quantity of clients we\u2019ll be able to plug in.\u201d\nFor now, Hydro-Quebec has more than enough power supply, but that surplus could be diminished if more bitcoin miners move to town. The power utility is strategically playing its hand, as evidenced by a shift in its typical strategy to lure industry by offering lower rates. In the case of bitcoin miners, it\u2019s looking to charge more for overtaxing capacity.\nFor instance, multiple proposed bitcoin mining projects boast capacity as high as 100 mw, which is much more power even than it takes to keep the lights on at the home of the Montreal Canadiens.\nBut bitcoin miners are crying foul, including local operation Bitfarms. The startup\u2019s co-founder bemoaned a possible rate hike, saying in a statement:\n\u201cWe are building the computing power and electrical infrastructure that will power the blockchain with Quebec hydroelectric power,\u201d said Pierre-Luc Quimper, pointing to the dozens of jobs that the company has ushered into the region.\nPlus, according to Bitfarms\u2019 Twitter page, they plan to hire hundreds more across analyst, technician, engineer and developer positions.\nMontreal is conducive to bitcoin mining not only for its\u00a0cheap hydropower but also\u00a0its\u00a0frigid\u00a0temperatures. The cold climate helps to keep the computer systems performing the energy-intensive round-the-clock bitcoin mining cool.\nNorth American Grip\nMeanwhile, in the lower 48 bitcoin miners are being drawn westward to Washington, where they are similarly capitalizing on cheap hydroelectric power.\nBitcoin mining and blockchain have gripped the North American region even as\u00a0China stands to lose its top spot. Despite being home to about 75% of the world\u2019s bitcoin\u00a0mining,\u00a0China\u2019s harsh stance toward bitcoin mining threatens to knock it down as the US and Canadian profile rises.", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

However, Bitcoin met strong resistance at $9,000, and despite briefly piercing its armor, it had proved unable to break through that sell wall.\nEarlier this morning, though, the Bitcoin price punched through $9,000 and continued to climb, peaking at $9,300 on Bitfinex at approximately 1:30 PM UTC.

Following the conference, the National Internet Finance Association of China (NIFA) released a statement\u00a0announcing that the primary purpose of the conference was to conduct:\n\u201cResearch and analysis of the current Internet financial development situation, [and make] arrangements for the deployment of 2018 work.\u201d\nThe conference covered a large range of topics, from online credit to internet equity, but one standout topic was the mention of ICOs. China\u2019s approach to ICOs and the crypto space has undergone several developments this past year, with officials recently calling for greater crackdowns and blanket bans. In this statement, however, there were no such strong words. Instead, the document noted that the conference had emphasized the need to:\n\u201c[I]ntensify the popularization of Internet financial knowledge education and publicize policy and risk warnings.\u201d\nSpecifically, particular attention will be paid to informing citizens about ICOs and investment fraud. This educational stance possibly marks a new policy approach from Chinese authorities, focusing attention not on the activities themselves, but on providing \u201crisk-tips\u201d for their citizens regarding the dangers of virtual currency and fraudulent Initial Coin Offerings. One implementation of this policy change was suggested: an online financial quiz that would directly raise awareness of the dangers.\nThis, however, is not the first attempt at cryptocurrency education from Chinese officials. Last month the same regulatory body, NIFA released a public notice which called for investors to be alert to the risks of ICOs and cryptocurrency trading. Specifically, the notice highlighted that Chinese officials were wary of the ICO space due to its unregulated nature, seeking to protect its citizens from\u00a0market manipulation and money laundering.\nIt is clear that Chinese officials central concern with ICO\u2019s and cryptocurrency is their lack of control over these developments, and so it is interesting to note that the press release made no mention of discussions around a national cryptocurrency.

While traders were gearing up for an all-out ban on cryptocurrency trading, it turns out they had nothing to sweat, as the South Korean government appears to be leaning toward green-lighting cryptocurrency exchanges.\nRather than take the approach of China, a relationship that is on the mend, South Korea has opted to make transparency a key focus of cryptocurrency trading in the spirit of \u201cfostering blockchain technology.\u201d It\u2019s a testament to what a concerted effort among a country\u2019s population can do, particularly in a government system that\u2019s willing to listen.\nOn one hand, the South Korean government views bitcoin, trading and blockchain closely linked but they also view them through separate silos.

These threats may come in the form of theft, natural disaster, fire accidents, unauthorized use, loss, e.t.c. In order to guard against these threats and eventualities, owners take deliberate measures to protect and preserve those belongings that they cherish.\nDigital Assets are Drawing Attention\nOne of the common and most reliable ways of securing personal belongings is by storing them in bank vaults. Therefore, the pronouncement by Canada based bank, VersaBank Inc. of building a vault for cryptocurrencies reveals the importance attached to these digital assets.\nBlockchain and cryptocurrencies are in their early stages of development, however, the reactions that events around the ecosystem are generating points towards a whole lot of potentials within the industry. Digital assets are products of blockchains whose ownership depends of the ability to retain the private keys that enable access. These private keys are usually very delicate entities due to the fact that losing them automatically implies losing every coin and asset to which they are tied.\nIt\u2019s All About Your Private Keys\nLosing one private key effectively means that such digital assets, like Bitcoins are lost forever. One may wonder why an entity of such value would be so delicate to protect. The truth is, this system is a part of the security upon which the technology is built. Considering the value that can be stored in a cryptocurrency wallet, stepping down on the security process could have a backfiring effect, leading to rampant cases of property theft.\nMost wallets have methods of recovering lost keys, or regaining access to wallets when the private keys are lost or forgotten. For instance, Bitpay\u2019s twelve-word backup phrase can be used to regain access when passwords are forgotten. However, users are always warned to keep such in a safe place and never share it with anyone.\nThe Story of Lost Coins\nThe story of James Howells of wales is popular in the Bitcoin world. Howells is known as the man who tossed a hard drive containing 7,500 Bitcoins back in 2013 when the coins were worth very little. The Bitcoins are now lost and cannot be retrieved despite the fortune that those coins may be worth at the moment. Several other coins may have been lost silently either in smaller numbers that won\u2019t make the news, or by other means, including the death of their owners. Such scenarios raise questions concerning how assets of such magnitude in value can be preserved, and even possibly transferred to heirs, in the case of death or incapacitation.\nTherefore, considering the present value attached to digital assets and cryptocurrencies, and also the forecast in terms of potential, the actions of VersaBank Inc. is a pointer towards what the ecosystem should expect in the future.\nA Digital Vault\nOn the technology behind the digital vault being created, VersaBank CEO, David Taylor says:\n\u201cOur differentiator in this market is to be secure and super private. The bank wouldn\u2019t have any kind of back door to open up the vault, we\u2019re just providing the facility that folks could put their digital keys in.\u201d\nThis digital vault is being designed by a team of software engineers, led by cybersecurity expert Gurpreet Sahota. The vault will securely store digital assets on computer servers around the world. Like a safety deposit box, the bank won\u2019t know what\u2019s inside and VersaBank cannot access the contents.\nBank vaults are regarded as one of the safest and reliable places to appropriately store precious items and records. As digitals assets gradually make way into the mainstream, more formal and organised methods of administration will be expected, including appropriate methods security and transfer. Apparently, such developments are already upon us.", "category": "Banking"}

Iceland\u2019s renewable energy from hydroelectric and geothermal power plants has delivered competitive electricity rates.\nSmari McCarthy, a lawmaker from Iceland\u2019s Pirate Party, wants to tax bitcoin mines. According to ABC News, the lawmaker\u2019s initiative will find support due to Icelanders\u2019 skepticism about financial speculation following the country\u2019s banking crash in 2008.\nCompanies creating value pay taxes under normal circumstances, McCarthy told The Associated Press.\nThe town of Keflavik on Iceland\u2019s southern peninsula has attracted virtual currency miners who are building large construction sites on the town\u2019s outskirts.\nMining To Double\nJohann Snorri Sigurbergsson, a business development manager at Hitaveita Sudurnesja, a local energy company, expects virtual currency mining to double the country\u2019s energy consumption to around 100 megawatts, which exceeds that used for the country\u2019s 340,000 households, according to the country\u2019s National Energy Authority.\nSigurbergsson said he could not have predicted this development four months ago. The Svartsengi geothermal plant supports the southwestern peninsula, where the mining takes place. He said he recently met with a mining company that wants to purchase 18 megawatts.\nAt Mjolnir, the largest of three mining farms in Keflavik, tall metal fences surround 50-meter-long warehouse buildings containing computer mining rigs.\nThese data centers are designed to take advantage of the regular wind on the peninsula. The buildings have partial walls to allow cold air to cool the equipment.\nAlso read: Bitcoin mining isn\u2019t an \u2018environmental Armageddon\u2019: Credit Suisse report\nMiner Objects\nHelmuth Rauth, who oversees operations for Genesis Mining, said bitcoin mining\u00a0should not be singled out as environmentally taxing.

He pointed to the energy needed for credit card transactions and Internet research, and said cryptocurrencies have the same global impact.\nRauth compared the mining activity to gold mining. Genesis Mining began in Germany and moved to Iceland in 2014.\nResidents of Reykjavik remain skeptical. When the bank crash hit in 2008, the Pirate Party was swept into power and presently holds 105 of the seats in Parliament.

Although volumes remain low, the price of most major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Bitcoin Cash remain relatively high.\nBitcoin\nEarlier today, on Feburary 13, bitcoin surpassed the $9,000 mark for the first time since February 10. While bitcoin has not been able to recover beyond $10,000, which many analysts consider as the psychological threshold, bitcoin has recorded an optimistic weekly performance.\u00a0\n\nIn the beginning of the week, on February 6, the price of bitcoin dipped below $6,500, moving dangerously close towards $6,000. Today, the price of bitcoin remains well above $8,000, and it is preparing to initiate a short-term rally to break the $9,000 mark. \nBitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are in an ideal position to record new gains in the upcoming days. But, the volumes of major cryptocurrencies must hold up. Over the last 12 hours, the daily trading volume of the market in general has been relatively low, and bitcoin will need more volume to breakthrough $9,000 and prepare recovery towards the $10,000 mark.\nThere exists optimism surrounding the short-term performance of bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, given the enthusiasm of investors in the traditional finance market. Even though bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a new asset class has been introduced to the traditional finance market in the form of futures, the majority of institutional investors remain uninvested in the asset class.\nThis week, JPMorgan, one of the largest banks in the world with a $380 billion market valuation, noted in a cryptocurrency paper entitled \u201cJPMorgan Perspectives: Decrypting Cryptocurrencies, Technology, Applications, and Challenges\u201d that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will have an important role in diversifying one\u2019s global bond and equity portfolio.\nThe JPMorgan report on the cryptocurrency market delved into the correlation between technical developments and price of cryptocurrencies, and explained that minimizing risk in cryptocurrency investment by diversifying assets is crucial. The report read:\n\u201cThe excitement of innovation typically also leads to price booms and then crashes among the early movers, before more realistic prices emerge among the eventual survivors. Much of this is what we see today with exponential price gains and losses, growth and diversity among cryptocurrencies. Given the amount of speculation in these markets, technical signals can be very useful in gauging market direction and they have been sending the right signals in recent months.\u201d\nExposure of investors in the traditional finance market to the cryptocurrency sector through reports like JPMorgan\u2019s \u201cbitcoin bible\u201d and introduction of markets such as bitcoin futures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could lead the price of bitcoin to increase in the mid-term.\nEthereum. Ripple, Bitcoin Cash\nEthereum, Ripple, and Bitcoin Cash, the second, third, and fourth largest cryptocurrencies in the market, have followed the price trend of bitcoin over the past week, since most cryptocurrencies tend to follow the price trend of the most dominant cryptocurrency in times of extreme volatility.\n\nEther, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, is also trying to rebuild momentum to regain its position above the $1,000 mark, similar to bitcoin.

These include a website known as \u2018fire money network\u2019. Traders could buy digital assets from the website through peer-to-peer transactions, funding purchases using Alipay, the popular third-party mobile and online payment platform created by Internet giant Alibaba in 2004.\nChinese media also reports dozens of over-the-counter platforms for trading cryptocurrencies in operation in China, albeit with servers hosted outside the country. The Chinese government is reportedly ramping up efforts to block domestic access to those platforms to completely stamp out cryptocurrency trading.\nPopular Chinese search engine Baidu and social media platform Weibo were prohibited from running ICO or crypto ads. Domestically, however, Tencent\u2019s popular messaging apps weixin, (wechat) and QQ have seen a growing number of cryptocurrency trading groups. Wechat users in China have a money transfer function built into the service, allowing them to link their accounts with bank accounts.\nChina\u2019s intentions are twofold. Some observers suggest the bans on ICOs and instructions to domestic exchanges to shut down are intended to stabilize China\u2019s financial services sector, which is seen as a systemic risk to the Chinese economy.\nAnother possible reason for the CCP\u2019s public stance on cryptocurrencies is its relative lack of control over the industry. China\u2019s government asserts control over many facets of Chinese life, from media to banking, and many industries are dominated by state-owned enterprises. Furthermore, China\u2019s central bank is trialing its own, state-run cryptocurrency. Such a regulated currency would enhance Beijing\u2019s ability to oversee the activities of China\u2019s 1.3 billion people.\nWhether the Chinese government is able to finally shut the doors on unofficial channels of crypto trading remains to be seen. At the moment, their efforts have been effective at the official level, but suspicion remains that many Chinese citizens are finding increasingly sophisticated ways to evade the bans.", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

Read the first part here\u00a0and the second here.\nFees: The Third Bottleneck\nJust like price, transaction fees can very easily scare away people from entering the cryptocurrency market or, in the worst case, ever spending bitcoin. Even if you\u2019re only investing, and don\u2019t really need to use cryptocurrency on a daily basis, would you rather have to pay cents or a hefty portion of your transaction? That\u2019s a no brainer.\nIf we see the case of bitcoin it becomes obvious it will soon stop being supported by merchants and people who use it as money. Check the graph below to understand why.\nhttps://blockchain.info/charts/transaction-fees-usd\nThe exponential growth in transaction fees is indeed a bottleneck. Other cryptocurrencies haven\u2019t suffered the same fate due to different factors. But the most important, I believe, is because of the low volume of users, compared to bitcoin.\nWhy is that? \nDo you remember what happened to the ethereum network during the CryptoKitties boom?\nIf you see no relation between the network becoming clogged and transaction fees, it\u2019s ok, although they\u2019re intimately related (like Luke and Leia). During the CryptoKitties boom, the network became extremely slow and clogged, due to the fact people were using ethereum as money, in order to buy adorable virtual kitties. So if you actually had to make a payment, transfer, invest in an ICO, whatever it was, the only way to have your transaction processed in a timely manner was *drumroll*.. to pay high transaction fees!\nIn bitcoin we can easily check if there is any sort of correlation between transaction fees and the number of unconfirmed transactions. What this can tell us is something really obvious: if there are more transactions waiting to be approved, the fee will increase. We can simply look at the below mempool transaction count, which is basically the number of transactions waiting to be approved.\nhttps://blockchain.info/charts/mempool-count?timespan=1year\nTransaction fees increase when the mempool increases. Obviously the overall price of transaction fees also increases if the price of bitcoin increases in USD. You can easily compare both graphs and see for yourself.\nWe will discuss scalability later, I assure you, but right now let\u2019s quickly analyse transactions and miners behaviour.\nWhat can we learn from that?\nAlthough the incentive for validators (miners) is to have the highest transaction fee possible per block, the opposite happens for users (people who transact in bitcoin). If there is unbalance, people simple move away, switching their bitcoin into another cryptocurrencies or fiat. If transaction fees are too low, then fewer miners will want to join the network and it takes longer for transactions to get approved.\n\u2014 For the sake of the argument, I\u2019m not taking into account the massive role the difficulty algorithm plays in this scenario. What is key to understand here is that the difficulty adjustment algorithm decides how hard it is for miners to solve a block. So the less miners (or full nodes) the easier the algorithm is, the more miners the harder it gets\u2014\nIf you have bitcoin in an exchange you can simple trade it for another coin and that\u2019s it. But if you\u2019re locked with bitcoin in your personal wallet (keep it secret. Keep it safe) that means even if you want to get rid of your bitcoin, guess what pal? You\u2019re going to pay high transaction fees anyway, as you\u2019ll have to send your bitcoin from your personal wallet into an exchange wallet. So there you have it. No running away from the transaction fee monster.\nSo\u2026 Just have faith transaction fees will get lower? \nThere are different outcomes that can possible lower transaction fees. Some are:\n\na) More miners join the network, increasing the computer power needed to validate hashes. This in turn will lower the transaction fees, as less computer power is needed to solve each block. The power to mine a block becomes increasingly distributed.\nb) There is no spike in the number of users joining the network (lol).\nc) The number of miners does not decrease exponentially.\nd) The lightning network gets implemented (it\u2019s well underway).\ne) Segwit is massively adopted.\nf) A different type of validation system is created (like PoS), which seems to be unlikely in the near future.\ng) The block gets increased (which is a fine short-term solution too)\n\nTransaction fees work as an incentive mechanism and I believe the bitcoin\u2019s pow consensus (and even a future pos) will always need fees to properly function. That also gives users the power to decide how fast they need their transactions to go through.\nAt the end of the day, cryptocurrency holders could just move to a different coin and be done with bitcoin. But do you really see that happening?", "category": "Bitcoin Education"}

The views expressed are those of the authors alone and should not be attributed to CCN.\nThis end of 2017 has been marked by a high price volatility on cryptocurrency markets, where even the price of dominant market share cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ripple and Ether has fluctuated substantially. While quite a bit of emphasis has been given to the reasonableness of the value of the cryptocurrencies (or some would say, the lack thereof), and the regulatory oversight on the offering of such cryptocurrencies to the public, namely the process called Initial Coin Offering (ICO), the risks of market abuse have been far less discussed, not to say properly dealt with.\nMarket manipulation still represents a substantial issue for investors. The UK prudential regulator found in a 2016 report that possible insider trading could have occurred in as many as 30% of takeovers in the UK in the four years prior to 2009 and in around a fifth of takeovers in 2015. Besides, in the modern age of financial markets, new kinds of cybernetic market manipulation, driven by artificial intelligence, digital technology and social media, is not exclusive to cryptocurrency markets and could cause massive and instantaneous distortion of information and prices in other markets, as well. For instance, the US regulator Commodity Futures Trading Commission has concluded that the Flash Crash of 6 May 2010, which resulted in a trillion-dollar stock market crash during only half an hour on that day, has been at least significantly provoked by market manipulation.\nSince its inception, the distributed ledger technology (\u201cDLT\u201d) has been thought as a way to improve transactions transparency, mitigate systemic risk and strengthen financial stability. Experts of the regulatory technology industry (known as \u201cRegTech\u201d) have even described blockchain as having the potential effect to create compliance partnerships between regulators and market participants, by directly inputting compliance rules inside the blockchain (i.e. via a smart contract) and therefore facilitating an almost real-time access, analysis and processing of data. \u00a0\nNevertheless, in reality, market abuse risks have not been eliminated by DLT, and, given the nature of unregulated ICOs or cryptocurrencies investments, such risks are, in many ways, far greater. Lack of information on price formation and order execution, central order book manipulation, or price manipulations such as \u201cpump and dump\u201d and \u201cspoofing\u201d practices represent only some of the potential issues for investors in cryptocurrencies.\nA quick survey of current regulations shows that most countries have taken broad legal measures to allow regulators to intervene in any market abuse, provided they can identify its existence. In European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) member states, the key regulation related to market manipulation and insider trading is the Market Abuse Regulation No 596/2014 of 14 April 2014 (\u201cMAR\u201d), which replaced the EU Market Abuse Directive of 28 January 2003 and entered into effect on 3 July 2016. In addition to several disclosure requirements, the MAR regulation outlaws in the EU three types of abuse on financial, commodity and related derivatives markets:\n\u00a0\n\nMarket manipulation (i.e. disseminating false or misleading information or securing the price of one or several financial instrument(s) at an abnormal or artificial level);\nInsider dealing (i.e. use of inside information by a person in possession of such information: (a) by transacting in financial instrument(s) to which that information relates, on his own account or for the account of a third-party, directly or indirectly; or (b) by recommending or advising a third-party to engage in insider dealing), and;\nUnlawful disclosure of non-public information (i.e. abnormal disclosure of inside information to a third-party by a person in possession of such information).\n\n\u00a0\nHowever, the application of the MAR regulation to cryptocurrencies appears to be limited, due to the fact that these rules only apply to financial instruments under the definition of the MIF Directive 2014/65/EU (\u201cMIF\u201d). According to several EU member states (e.g. Austria, France, Czech Republic, Poland), in the current state of law, most existing cryptocurrencies do not meet the characteristics of a financial instrument. In the EU, only the German financial regulator has classified the virtual currencies, including Bitcoins, as financial instruments, in accordance with section \u00a71(11) of the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz). Yet this decision by the German regulator has not been completed by the publication of the precise legal implications of such classification.\nSimilarly to the EU, the Israeli Securities Act prohibits the use of various market manipulations, such as insider trading and unlawful disclosure of information. The Israeli Securities Authority (\u201cISA\u201c) has been vested with investigative and enforcement powers to enforce such misconducts. The Act applies to the use of various securities, however, as in most EU countries, there is currently no clear interpretation that securities under Israeli law include cryptocurrencies. Therefore, one would argue that both the sale and trade of cryptocurrency under Israeli law are not regulated by the securities law and that market manipulation is not clearly prohibited. \u00a0\nEven if the regulators adopt a broader view of existing legislation and apply existing prohibitions under the law to market manipulations, they would face a significant barrier of identifying such manipulations and their sources. One thing that stands out when dealing with cryptocurrencies is their anonymous nature. Cryptocurrencies move from one digital wallet to another at a fast pace without real names or IDs, using cryptographic (private) keys as the only identification. While blockchain technology registers every single transaction over the distributed ledger, making and proving the connection between a certain misconduct and the person behind it can turn into very complicated issue. One explanation for this is because the industry lacks the technological tools that can be used to spot and identify certain illegal actions, like the ones regulators and market participants use for the regulated markets (e.g. the stock exchanges).\nFurthermore, unlike controlling the trading in stock exchanges, when it comes to cryptocurrencies there is no single public authority officially in charge of enforcing market manipulations. Indeed, cryptocurrencies are usually not registered as securities, derivatives and/or financial instruments and therefore are traded over various platforms spread around the world. Many regulators would find it hard to claim responsibility and legal powers to enforce such misconduct, where in reality the exchange platform is located in a foreign jurisdiction, and the actual misconduct was committed over the internet, by using social platforms, like Slack, Telegram, Twitter and Facebook. \nDespite the obvious challenges of enforcing crypto-market-manipulation sanctions, there are early signs of change. One example was pointed out by the Polish Deputy Finance Minister who said publicly in 2014 that options, futures and swap instruments denominated in cryptocurrencies (or whose underlyings are related to cryptocurrencies) may be considered as derivatives and thus potentially as financial instruments. In Israel, the ISA published in December 2017 a draft amendment to the Israeli Stock Exchange articles suggesting banning from its indexes companies whose main business is investing, holding or mining cryptocurrencies. This announcement was a quick reaction to an unusual trade in an Israeli company capital stock which was a direct result of the company\u2019s announcement of its intentions to get involved in the crypto mining business. The director of the ISA has expressed his deep concerns to Israeli investors in the share market, where there is little-to-no correlation between the real economic value of the company and the price of its shares. \nYet, most regulators tend to move slow, especially in uncharted territory such as blockchain. In contrast, exchange platforms and investments can move faster. Overall, as the crypto-currencies market rapidly shifts from its \u2018avant-garde\u2019 state to the \u2018mainstream\u2019, exchanges will be pressured to install more controls and tools designed to prevent and stop market manipulations. One such control may very well be the use of the integral technology of blockchain and require the creation of a structure which would permit the storage of immutable regulatory data communicated by companies through public, consortium or fully private distributed ledgers. Under such a storage structure, discussions should emerge to use smart contracts for regulatory control automation and to include financial market regulators directly into the information integrity validation and verification process.\nThis form of \u2018self-regulation\u2019, which means automated compliance and monitoring by market participants represents strategic development on mitigating market abuse risks. As the public statement by cryptocurrency exchange platform Bittrex showed on 25 November 2017, cryptocurrencies exchanges would be wisely advised to provide general statements to their clients discouraging market manipulation tactics and providing legal wording in their terms and conditions as well as internal processes and technical alert rules (to efficiently analyze unusual price movements, order-to-cancel ratios, pumps and dumps etc.) and harsh policies with the established violations. To face these issues, ICO funders, cryptocurrencies exchanges and wallet providers would also need to train actively and regularly their personnel on market abuse risks and compliance with regulations. Finally, beyond the constraints and legal burdens, the emergence of regulatory compliance via the use of DLT and smart contracts could represent a significant opportunity for financial institutions from a cost perspective.", "category": "News"}

In a Q&A, which is posted on the New York Fed\u2019s website, the economists question bitcoin\u2019s utility, arguing it will never be as easy to use as the current central bank-backed fiat money, pointing to a host of concerns \u2014 not the least of which surrounds trust. But they don\u2019t write bitcoin off, seeming instead to applaud the ingenuity while simultaneously dismissing its potential.\nThat the economists decided to pit bitcoin, etc. against fiat money is okay, and spending is certainly a key application\u00a0of cryptocurrencies. But even Brad Garlinghouse, chief executive of XRP-fueled cross-border payments startup Ripple, isn\u2019t against fiat money. It\u2019s not always cryptocurrencies versus fiat currencies.\nAnd in their argument, the NY Fed economists seem to take the tack that bitcoin and the others are gearing up to\u00a0compete more directly with fiat currencies in the future, giving the trust and convenience argument to centralized fiat money given its head start in these areas.\nThe economists are quick to argue:\n\u201cIf we lived in a dystopian world without trust, bitcoin might dominate existing payment methods. But in this world, where people do tend to trust financial institutions to handle payments and central banks to maintain the value of money it seems unlikely that bitcoin could ever be as convenient as existing payment means.\u201d\nAnd while it\u2019s not unusual for economists to draw comparisons between cryptocurrency features and the more mature markets of a centralized system, the argument fails to account for the impossible feat that bitcoin has been able to achieve thus far, garnering it a market cap of $146 billion at last count. Let\u2019s examine some of their analysis.\nTrust\nLee and Martin, who are in the New York Fed\u2019s money and payment studies function, point to bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin as being among the top cryptocurrencies \u2013 ok so far.\u00a0Trust, they say, is what makes the centralized monetary system tick, from writing checks, to credit and debit cards to cash, the last of which requires trust in the central bank that issued it.\nBut they point to a weakness in cryptocurrencies, which is that it can be used as a vehicle that can be used even in an environment where a lack of trust exists. While an issue, the anonymity factor is truer with some digital coins more than others, and it\u2019s something regulators are feverishly trying to tackle.\nValidation\nThey also call into question the validation of the cryptocurrency system, arguing that \u201ceverybody in the bitcoin network could be picked, essentially at random, to validate recent transactions.\u201d But they fail to mention that an attacker must have 51% control of a network\u2019s computing power to alter transactions.\nThe Future\nThey admit that wider adoption of bitcoin could lead to an increase in its worth, even drawing a\u00a0comparison\u00a0to the US dollar that is similarly no longer backed by any commodity.\u00a0Incidentally, the economists rule that cryptocurrencies solve the problem surrounding \u201cmaking payments in a trustless environment.\u201d The problem with that, they say, is they\u2019re not sure it\u2019s a problem worth solving.\nBut they fail to point to the benefits of digital coin payments, including the remittance of payments among migrant workers to their families in unbanked regions of the world or the awakening of blockchain technology that underpins bitcoin, which is transforming business as we know it.\nSure there\u2019s volatility. And as they point out, nefarious activities can be traced back to bitcoin and other cyrptocurrencies that have forced the hand of regulators in China, South Korea and more to act. All of this surely interferes with the integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream.\nBut bitcoin at its core is a decentralized digital coin, meaning that it was never intended to function inside the confines of a centralized system. For that reason, bitcoin and altcoins will continue to frustrate many central bankers.", "category": "Banking"}

The DCG, of course, is the parent company of Grayscale Investments, which has created a fund that holds ETC on behalf of fund shareholders.\nConsequently, Silbert has a vested interest in promoting ETC. Even so, Silbert\u2019s tweet was prescient, because within hours the Ethereum Classic price had embarked on a 20 percent rally \u2014 an advance that came even as other top cryptocurrencies pivoted into negative territory.\nAt present, the Ethereum Classic price is trading at $32 on Bitfinex, up from a low near $24.50 on Monday. This translates into $3.3 billion market cap, ranking ETC 14th on the charts.\nETC Price Chart\nAirdrop FOMO or a South Korean Pump?\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear what is contributing to the rally. There is speculation that it is tied to the upcoming launch of the Callisto Network, which will airdrop its tokens (CLO) to current ETC holders. However, developers have planned the airdrop\u2019s blockchain snapshot for block\u00a05500000, which will take place on approximately March 5. Consequently, it seems somewhat doubtful that ETC is surging to such a great degree when the airdrop is still 20 days out.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nA glance at ETC\u2019s daily trading volume, though, shows a fairly-significant concentration of volume on South Korean exchanges, which currently price it at a premium of roughly seven percent over its value on other exchanges. On Upbit, ETC/KRW is priced at an equivalent value of $34.17, while Coinone prices it as high as $34.27. Altogether, KRW pairs account for more than 37 percent of all ETC trading volume.\nThat said, this concentration of trading volume does not necessarily indicate that this is a coordinated pump. Rather, it could be indicative of the fact that South Korean traders \u2014 forced to undergo KYC verification following the adoption of new cryptocurrency trading regulations \u2014 had yet to buy into ETC following the initial Callisto announcement last month.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

During December and January, over one billion new Tethers were issued which coincided with the incredible increase in price that bitcoin experienced.\nTether has since placed a \u201cproof of funds\u201d button on their homepage, leading to an evaluation from Friedman LLP to address concerns, but the report\u00a0itself is almost half a year old, and doesn\u2019t account for the massive amount of assets created since then.\nThe big issue: There\u2019s never been an audit, and the folks behind Tether has been quite shady when asked. They have continuously claimed their tokens are backed 100% by actual dollars, yet they have failed to present any evidence to support this claim.\nBack in December, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sent subpoenas to both Bitfinex and Tether most likely in relation to the growing controversies surrounding the lack of an audit of their current holdings.\nWeiss also points readers to \u201cBitfinex\u2019ed\u201d \u2013 a Twitter user who has been consistently posting about Tether and Bitfinex\u2019s questionable operations practices. Bitfinex\u2019ed argues that the project was artificially inflating the price of bitcoin by issuing increased numbers of Tether during bitcoin\u2019s recent ascent over $19,000.\nOn social media, there appears to be consensus that what Tether is actually doing is running a fractional reserve system.\nIn other words, most observers claim they DO NOT have the dollars to back up all those Tether coins.\nThe article also informs users of ways in which they can protect themselves, including refraining from keeping digital assets on exchanges that handle Tether, and to not trade in pairs against Tether. It also mentions the catastrophic\u00a0consequences of Tether potentially proving to be fraudulent, as it is a massive source of liquidity\u00a0in the cryptocurrency markets.\nWeiss in the Cryptocurrency Space\nWeiss just recently entered the cryptocurrency space with their ratings report issued back in January. Normally covering stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and more, Weiss took the plunge into digital assets due to their increased media presence and interest from traditional investors.\nHowever, some were a bit nervous due to the weight of their opinion potentially having drastic market effects.\nPrior to the release of their digital asset ratings report, Weiss came under fire from a myriad of distributed denial of service attacks from Korea to prevent it from surfacing. The attacks managed to take the website offline for a few hours on January 24th, but it didn\u2019t prevent the release of the report. Plenty of fake reports also surfaced, with individuals looking to capitalize on Weiss\u2019 notoriety by granting fake ratings to lesser-known cryptocurrencies to increase their price action.\nSince the release of the report, Weiss has been capitalizing on the cryptocurrency-craze by releasing weekly content, including an explanation for their C+ rating for bitcoin which initially stirred up the community.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

Last year was hot for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and most all altcoins. With amazing percentage gains across the board, there were many investors who took profits. Now, Uncle Sam\u00a0is looking for his cut, but despite the major tax reform put in place for 2018 by the current U.S. Administration, not much has been done to clear up the gray area on the taxation of cryptocurrencies.\nOld laws on the books\nThe latest tax information\u00a0regarding cryptocurrencies was published by the IRS in 2014 and states that \u201cvirtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as a substitute for real currency, is referred to as \u2018convertible\u2019 virtual currency.\u201d Furthermore, IRS states, \u201cFor federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.\u201d Finally, concerning gains and losses, the IRS publication goes on to state the following:\nThe character of the gain or loss generally depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. A taxpayer generally realizes capital gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. For example, stocks, bonds, and other investment property are generally capital assets. A taxpayer generally realizes ordinary gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is not a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. Inventory and other property held mainly for sale to customers in a trade or 4 business are examples of property that is not a capital asset. \nAccording to the IRS, Bitcoin is not a \u201ccurrency\u201d but rather virtual property that is subject to taxation as normal property would be subject to. This is pretty disadvantageous to anyone who suffers a loss because property losses are capped at $3,000 for a write off per year, for married filers. To assist tax filers, Investopedia has a helpful guide\u00a0to figure out this complicated situation. Working with an accountant to calculate taxes is recommended.\nUncle Sam 1, Crypto 0\nAfter a court case in late November 2017, the IRS won the right to gain access to some 14,000 Coinbase accounts, in which users had Bitcoin-only transactions in excess of $20,000, between the years of 2013 and 2015. After this ruling, Coinbase will be issuing 1099-K forms and reporting earnings to the IRS for users in excess of $20,000 for the 2017 tax year. The following is from Coinbase\u2019s support website: \u201cFor U.S. users only, Coinbase provides\u00a0Forms 1099-K\u00a0to certain business users and GDAX users that have received at least $20,000 cash for sales of cryptocurrency related to at least 200 transactions in a calendar year.\u201d\nTax Legislation down the Road\nWith Coinbase\u2019s record profits this year (SAMBURAJ PLEASE LINK TO INTERNAL STORY) of more than 1 billion USD, it would come as no surprise if the IRS auditors have their sights set on Coinbase and its users. However, over the past few years, the IRS has been suffering from a shrinking budget and downsizing staff. The number of audits performed each year has been shrinking in general, but that is no reason not to report your cryptocurrency earnings. Since cryptocurrency gained international attention in 2017, there should be some developments in tax codes within the year. Remember, the U.S. Government needs to find a way to offset all the major tax cuts it approved for 2018 and cryptocurrency looks appetizing.", "category": "Bitcoin Economics"}

An announcement by the company confirms customers will be able to trigger domestic money transfers for instant transactions 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nLed by SBI Ripple Asia, the Japan Bank consortium was first launched in November 2016 with 42 members in a concentrated effort to develop blockchain solutions in payments and settlements. The consortium has since swelled to 61-member banks that account for over 80% of all banking assets in Japan. \u00a0Customers from the consortium\u2019s banks will be able to make instant domestic payments using a QR code, phone number or a bank account number, Ripple adds, resulting in a far easier and convenient process compared to traditional bank transfers.\nJapan\u2019s current national payments clearing platform, \u2018Zengin\u2019, only allows domestic money transfers between 8:30 AM and 3:30 PM in the country, with the added burden of existing banking and/or ATM fees. Ripple contends that its blockchain-based payments app will make for faster and cheaper domestic money transfers.\nSBI Ripple Asia CEO Takashi Okita added:\n\u201cTogether with the trust, reliability and reach of the bank consortium, we can remove friction from payments and create a faster, safer, and more efficient domestic payments experience for our customers.\u201d\nAt launch, three members of the consortium in SBI Net Sumishin Bank, Suruga Bank and Resona Bank will go live with the app in autumn 2018 followed by a \u2018staggered rollout\u2019 for the remaining 59 banks, Ripple said.\nThe effort represents the first notable application in consumer-ended retail payments over a blockchain by SBI Ripple Asia, a joint venture by Japanese financial services giant SBI Group and Ripple. The soon-to-launch blockchain payments app follows a notably successful money transfer pilot between the consortium\u2019s banks over a year ago.\nSince then, SBI Ripple Asia has also forayed beyond Japan\u2019s borders in piloting international blockchain remittance transfers between Japanese and South Korean banks. A separate pilot between Japan and Thailand over Ripple\u2019s blockchain resulted in a bank transfer within \u201ctwo to five seconds\u201d.", "category": "Banking"}

Briefly, bitcoin fall to $8,320, and the price of Ethereum also fell to $637, significantly below its all-time high established at $1,400.\n\nThe daily trading volume of bitcoin has remained relatively low for several days in a row, in the $5 billion region. The high volume of Tether, a cryptocurrency that is backed to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio, can be considered as a representation of the market\u2019s volatility, given that many traders on the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency trading platforms utilize Tether to hedge the value of cryptocurrencies to the US dollar.\nAt the time of reporting, the daily trading volume of Tether remains at $2.3 billion, which is nearly four times higher than that of Litecoin and over $800 million higher than that of Ethereum.\nCrypto Rand, a respected cryptocurrency investor and analyst, stated that the \u201cMisery Index\u201d of bitcoin is signaling a buy opportunity for bitcoin investors. Throughout the past six years, upon a dramatic surge in sell volumes, bitcoin has continued to recover from major corrections.\nFor instance, in December 2016, the price of bitcoin dipped below the $800 mark as sell volumes intensified. But, throughout early 2017, the price of bitcoin rallied to $4,000, eventually achieving $19,000 within the same year.\n\n#Bitcoin \u201cMisery Index\u201d signaling a great buy opportunity here. pic.twitter.com/vwLr88kPSq\n\u2014 Crypto Rand (@crypto_rand) March 11, 2018\nFor instance, in December 2016, the price of bitcoin dipped below the $800 mark as sell volumes intensified. But, throughout early 2017, the price of bitcoin rallied to $4,000, eventually achieving $19,000 within the same year.\nIt is also important to consider the major factors that are causing the price of bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies to be extremely volatile. Some state that it is the sell off of Mt. Gox bitcoins, worth over $1.5 billion, that is preventing the market to recover.\nIf Mt. Gox sell off has been causing the cryptocurrency market to fall, once it stops in the short-term, the market will not be affected by many millions of dollars worth of bitcoin being dumped into the public market, on cryptocurrency exchanges.\nAs sell volumes decline and the demand for major cryptocurrencies increase again, and the rise of demand coincides with the halted sell off of Mt. Gox bitcoins, the price of bitcoin will likely be able to recover to January 2018 levels, given the current trend.\nEthereum and Alternative Cryptocurrencies\nIn a volatile period, bitcoin tends to outpeform other major cryptocurrencies and smaller tokens. In the past 24 hours, while the price of Ether has dropped nearly 4 percent, bitcoin has dropped slightly by 2 percent.\nTokens like EOS and Tron, which recorded massive gains on March 10, have also declined by around 4 percent, following the trend of Ethereum.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is expected to grow by 194 percent, while Bitcoin Cash is expected to grow 123 percent.\nThe survey, according to the SCMP, was based on price levels seen on February 27. At the time, Bitcoin was above $10,00 and Ethereum was at $870. This means that, according to respondents, by the end of the year, Ethereum\u2019s price would be at $2,550. Bitcoin would hit $29,533, and Bitcoin Cash would be at $2,721.\nThe survey\u2019s projections would mean both Bitcoin and Ethereum would see their value more than triple within nine months, as recent price trends saw Bitcoin drop to $8,800 at press time. Ethereum is currently trading at $670.\nThe expected growth in Ethereum\u2019s market cap is reportedly driven by the applicability of its network, and the growth of initial coin offerings (ICOs) As covered by Hacked, ICO fundraising has topped $1.2 billion in February, bringing the total amount raised this year to $2.7 billion.\nPer the SCMP, Ethereum\u2019s price dip is seeing investors buy more, so they can then participate in more ICOs. Si Oh, vice-president at Octagon, a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency broker, revealed his firm has been seeing interest in Ethereum pick up, although he revealed interest in Bitcoin is still prevalent.\nHe said:\n\u201cBitcoin still accounts for an outsized portion of our flows [today]. To put it in perspective, average daily Bitcoin turnover is still more than three fold that of Ethereum.\u201d\nKevin Loo, co-founder and chief strategy officer at CryptAM, a Hong Kong-based digital asset management firm, also told the news outlet he expected Ethereum to have a bright future. Loo pointed out that the cryptocurrency, just like Bitcoin, faces scaling issues, although he believes these are being properly taken care of.\nTo prove his point, he pointed to the CryptoKitties craze that temporarily congested the network. He stated:\n\u201cAs an example, in November 2017, the ethereum network saw a new craze for CryptoKitties, a virtual kitten game which lets players buy and breed \u2018crypto-pets\u2019. This slows the network down and highlighted one of the challenges facing older blockchains \u2013 a lack of scalability.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

If the value of bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market is in a rut, Indonesians have missed the memo.\nSpeaking to Bloomberg, Indonesia Digital Asset Exchange (INDODAX) chief executive Oscar Darmawan claims the platform is on track to have 1.5 million KYC-registered users by the end of the 2018. With thousands of new users registering every day, the crypto exchange currently sees 1.14 million users after opening its doors in 2014.\nIn contrast, the Indonesia Stock Exchange, the country\u2019s national stock exchange, has a total of 1.18 million registered participants that trade stocks, futures, exchange-traded funds and options of listed companies worth a combined $520 billion, Bloomberg adds. The current combined market cap of cryptocurrencies stands at $355 billion, down from an all-time high of nearly $830 billion in early January this year.\nBali-based INDODAX, formerly Bitcoin.co.id before a rebrand, offers fiat-to-bitcoin purchases to domestic users alongside crypto-to-crypto trading wherein bitcoin can be swapped for a handful of other supported coins including Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, DASH, Stellar and more. The executive further revealed that the exchange is currently facilitating an average of 100 billion rupiah ($7.3 million) in trading volume every day, a figure he hopes to double by the end of the year.\nHe added:\n\u201cWe are seeing almost 3,000 new members signing up everyday. Most people are trading in bitcoins though transactions in ethereum has increased significantly of late.\u201d\nThe insights are particularly noteworthy in underlining a continuing trend of heightening retail investors\u2019 interest in cryptocurrencies. Indonesia, in particular, harbors a hostile environment toward cryptocurrencies due to authorities repeated crackdowns.\nWhile the central bank, Bank Indonesia, hasn\u2019t banned cryptocurrency exchanges in the country, the institution\u2019s governor has previously threatened legal action against bitcoin adopters using the cryptocurrency for payments. After the central bank has outlawed cryptocurrencies as legal tender, there have been reports of authorities swooping in on establishments accepting the cryptocurrency in Bali.\nStill, Indonesians\u2019 appetite for cryptocurrency continues to grow, despite the central bank urging \u2018all parties\u2019 in the country to refrain from selling, buying or trading cryptocurrencies in a recent January warning.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

The exchange operator this week began paying out compensation to the approximately 260,000 users who lost NEM tokens (XEM) as a result of the theft, and that compensation \u2014 which was paid in fiat \u2014 was worth nearly double the current NEM price.\nConsequently, it appears that investors are using those funds to repurchase their missing NEM, and in some cases, using the extra funds to increase their holdings above what they were at the time of the hack.\nBinance Coin Leaps on News of Decentralized Exchange, Public Blockchain\nEven NEM\u2019s climb, however, was eclipsed by that of Binance Coin (BNB), the eponymous utility token of one of the world\u2019s highest-volume cryptocurrency exchanges.

The report points to the deputy prime minister citing concerns of crypto abuse in money laundering, tax evasion and other criminal activity.\nPointedly, however, the deputy prime minister instructed the cabinet that the newly proposed law isn\u2019t meant to prohibit cryptocurrencies and their usage nor ICOs. Instead, the law proposing regulation is mean to safeguard adopters invested in cryptocurrencies, deputy PM Wissanu stressed.\nBefore its approval into law, the royal decree drafts must be reviewed and vetted by Thailand\u2019s Council of State, a number of qualified law councilors with experience in areas including law, economics, social sciences and more.\nThe drafts will also be formally reviewed and discussed by the country\u2019s financial authorities including the Finance Ministry, the Bank of Thailand, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Anti-Money laundering Office \u2013 jointly with the Council of State \u2013 as early as next week, as assigned by the cabinet.\nWissanu further revealed progress in working toward broader \u2018organic laws\u2019 by the Finance Ministry and the SEC wherein all digital asset transactions, including trades on cryptocurrency exchanges and those between brokers and dealers, will have to be registered with the relevant authorities.

Per his words, \u201cit is very important that there are clear rules to prevent this kind of activity from developing,\u201d thanks to the anonymity provided by various cryptocurrencies.\nHe added:\n\u201cIn this way the FATF [Financial Action Task Force], which is an international body that regulates these activities, has a very clear position in which it is necessary to monitor and propose legislative norms around the world to prevent these activities.\u201d\nThe minister\u2019s position seemingly reinforces the views of the world\u2019s economic leaders. As covered by CCN, the G20 communique showed \u201ccrypto-assets\u201d is a preferred term, and that cryptocurrencies raise issues when it comes to investor protection, tax evasion, market integrity, money laundering, and terrorism financing.\nThe document goes on to state regulation recommendations are coming in July 2018. These will presumably allow for the development of the digital economy and its technology, while hindering their use for criminal activities.\nNotably, Olivares pointed out that the European Union will not wait for a global agreement on cryptocurrencies. The minister revealed that the new digital economy should play its role in the \u201cfinancing of public goods, the welfare system, and collective needs,\u201d and not just leave it to the \u201cso-called old economy.\u201d He concluded:\n\u201cOur position is that we welcome the OECD proposals that have been presented here and we are ready to move forward. Tomorrow (March 21) the European Comission will propose a directive on how this new economy can participate in the financing of public accounts. Spain immediately joins the statements of other European colleagues and we want to move forward without the need to wait for a global agreement.

On the other hand, major Chinese credit agency Dagong had better things to say about the petro.\nThe Venezuelan president explained that after completing the 30 days of the pre-sale, there were two hundred thousand nine hundred and twenty seven( 200,927 )offers of intent to buy were received from Petro, by 133 countries.\nRussia and the Petro\nThe Russian Government has denied its involvement with the Venezuelan cryptocurrency \u201cEl Petro\u201d.\nAccording to Russian publication\u00a0TASS, Artyom Kozhin, deputy director of the Information and Press Department of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dismissed Time Magazine\u2019s report as\u00a0fake news and stressed that there is no involvement of Russian officials with the Venezuelan project.\n\u201cDuring the meeting held on February 21, 2018, in Moscow, Venezuelan Minister of Economy and Finance, [Simon] Zerpa, delivered a booklet on the crypto-coins to Russia, exclusively for the purpose of informing Russian partners about this project, \u201d the official revealed, insisting that Russia was not involved in the petro while confirming that the Venezuelan official had shared details of the cryptocurrency.\nTASS also reported that Maduro sought a number of trading partners for the Petro, including the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, euros, and the yuan. Investors will be able to trade those currencies on Friday, he said, although it is unclear where they will be able to do so. Venezuela has also not ruled on the matter.\nThe much-publicized Time article, now discredited by the Russian government, claimed Russian officials and Kremlin-connected entrepreneurs helped the Venezuelan government launch Petro,\u00a0\u201dIn other words, Petro was, in fact, a collaboration \u2013 a joint venture half-hidden between Venezuelan and Russian authorities and businessmen whose goal was to erode the power of US sanctions.\u201d", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The effect of these exchanges in the financial solutions industry is obvious in a number of areas. Payments and clearance, remittances, operations and several other aspects have experienced one form of intervention or the other as a result of crypto implementation through exchanges.\nIt All Goes Through the Exchange\nIn the current stage of the industry, the numerous opportunities that abound are accessible through these exchanges. For instance, the speculative market that is mainly responsible for the price fluctuations and increasing trade volumes are traded on exchanges. Beyond that, the alternative to traditional financial systems being offered by cryptocurrencies are the major reasons behind the several political and institutional interventions being experienced lately in the industry.\nThe reality is that there is a whole new financial ecosystem with several different aspects that wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the gateways created by the exchanges. So far in 2018, the ICO industry alone has consistently returned over $1 Billion revenue every month. This wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the role played by these exchanges that provide entry opportunities to newcomers in the industry. In order to participate in these ICOs and other crypto denominated opportunities, investors must first convert their fiat currencies to the denominated cryptocurrency (mostly ETH or BTC). This is where the crypto exchanges play an important role by offering the conversion opportunity. Same applies when converting from one cryptocurrency to another or from crypto back to fiat currencies.\nThe Irony of Necessity\nWhile more financially established nations and societies may boast of various alternative routes of entry into the emerging market of cryptocurrencies, the story isn\u2019t so for the less developed nations. Ironically, it is these less developed nations that even need the alternative cryptocurrency opportunities more. This is due to the absence of stable financial solutions infrastructure and unstable economic processes, as reflected by most of their national currencies.\nThe role of Golix in Zimbabwe as its only cryptocurrency exchange is indeed significant especially with the country\u2019s recent history of mainstream financial turmoil. The exchange steps in as an alternative to the almost hopeless situation that the country was plunged into with its record-breaking hyperinflation of the past decade.\nFollowing the hyperinflation of 2008, Zimbabwe adopted the US Dollar as its own local currency. This meant that the country\u2019s central bank could no longer print currencies like it usually did, thus the nation relied on imported cash from the US. Soon enough, Zimbabwe\u2019s financial problems moved from the over-availability of currency to insufficiency of notes to go round. This situation gave rise to various other multiple complications that included selling dollar notes for much more than they are really worth.\nBeyond Boundaries\nSuch a situation as described above automatically required a financial system that stretches beyond the direct influence of already twisted local institutions. Anyone could assume that cryptocurrencies couldn\u2019t have arrived at a better time than now for the Southern African nation. However, this had not been the case until the intervention by Golix who currently stand alone as the only indigenous cryptocurrency exchange operating in Zimbabwe, opening up new financial stability opportunity for the citizens.\nGolix may not have achieved a high liquidity due to the low level of awareness and citizen participation. However, it is normal to expect a relatively high demand since everyone runs to the same source for supply. This explains the high premium level recorded in Bitcoin trading as observed in Zimbabwe.\nIt\u2019s All About Participation\nBut then, as the company makes effort towards establishing a robust crypto ecosystem and vibrant marketplace in Zimbabwe and beyond, the team continues in participating in activities that would enhance this development. For instance, Golix team members are involved in the national discussion on the country\u2019s readiness for the digital revolution, and also its participation in the TOKEN2049 conference holding in Hong Kong is also a move to establish partnerships that will benefit both the nation and region as a whole in the long run.\nNo matter how popular the knowledge of cryptocurrencies and digital revolution becomes among any people and within a region, the intrinsic value that it offers can only be achieved through direct participation. Zimbabwe as a nation and the entire African region is ripe and due for this revolution, but an important aspect of this process is viable gateways.", "category": "Bitcoin Economics"}

However, it was evident that the market did not fall due to Binance, and it was overreaching to conclude that major cryptocurrencies fell in value by more than 5 percent because Binance received a simple letter from the Japanese financial services agency (FSA), as noted by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao.\n\u201cWe received a simple letter from JFSA about an hour ago. Our lawyers called JFSA immediately, and will find a solution. Protecting user interests is our top priority. No need to worry. Some negative news often turn out to be positive in the long term. Chinese have a proverb for this. New (often better) opportunities always emerge during times of change,\u201d said CZ.\nIt was quite apparent that the market drop was caused by the Binance situation with the Japanese government because even after the FUD was clarified by the Binance team, the market continued to slump. If a single factor in Binance caused the market to fall, that factor also should have been capable of leading the market to recovery.\nThe majority of analysts in the space attempt to justify every single movement in the market with news or some announcements, which is often extremely inaccurate and impractical. The cryptocurrency market moves up and down based on the supply and demand from the market. The market is still at its early phase, and it is comparable to the market valuation of major banks and thus, it is possible that whales or large-scale investors are initiating correlating movements in an attempt to influence the market.\n\nOver the past few weeks, all major cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and Ethereum were continuously volatile in the $8,000 and $9,000 region. Bitcoin fell from $9,000 to $8,300, recovered to $9,100, and fell to $8,500 today. These movements or daily volatility cannot be justified by one factor. It is a culmination of many factors that influence the market.\nPublic Market\nIn late 2017, the cryptocurrency market was extremely optimistic towards the entrance of institutional investors and retail traders through strictly regulated markets like the bitcoin futures market in the US. But, the demand from investors in the traditional finance sector did not match the expectations of cryptocurrency investors.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Cryptocurrency trading has gripped the South Korean population and inspired a bandwagon effect in which the greater the hype surrounding a digital coin, the higher the number of locals who want in.\nAnd it\u2019s not just the young generation. Cryptocurrency fever appears to be spreading, as evidenced by support from the country\u2019s baby boomer generation as well.\u00a0The findings underscore the results from a recent survey done by local news outlet Yonhap, which revealed that the millennial generation was leading the way for bitcoin investing.\nSome Context\nSouth Korea represents Asia\u2019s No. 4 economy with a total population of approximately 51 million.

Xiandong, who also goes by Eric,\u00a0set the record straight at the annual China Development Forum over the weekend.\n\u201cThe core of the blockchain lies in using technology to create a multi-party trust mechanism. Imagine if the participating parties trust the figures and objects if the world is fully digitalized. The authenticity of assets is a great challenge. In this sense, the blockchain has a very positive significance and is a cornerstone of the trust of the digital society in the future.\u201d \u2014 Xinadong\nThe Ant Financial executive also likened ICOs to China\u2019s white wolf rebellion of the early 20th century, providing his view of what\u2019s unfolded in the market thus far.

DvP exchanges among unconnected ledgers will require several interactions between buyer and seller, the report further noted.\nThe system can also impact the speed of the transaction, requiring liquidity to be temporarily blocked.

The market has operated within this boundary throughout March.\nContinuous Volatility\nThe cryptocurrency market has struggled to demonstrate signs of strong short-term recovery. Analysts have stated the $11,000 region as an ideal position to initiate a strong short to mid-term rally. But, the market has failed to sustain its momentum throughout March, and it is likely that it will continue to remain volatile due to its low daily trading volume in the upcoming days.\n\nAn intriguing aspect about the performance of the cryptocurrency market over the past 10 days is that it has not fallen or risen from its previous levels. It has constantly moved up and down within the range of $280 billion to $350 billion.\nSeveral alternative cryptocurrencies like Ontology and 0x have outperformed major cryptocurrencies on certain days, likely as a result of short-term pump. But, throughout the past week, the entire market has moved up and down altogether, with major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Cardano following a similar pattern in both drops and upward movements.\nToday, on March 28, bitcoin has shown strong sell volumes, as shown in the 15-minute candle chart below. The price of the cryptocurrency peaked at $8,200, but struggled to maintain that level and fell to $7,750, before rebounding to $7,850. Based on the current trend it is unlikely that it will make a move back to the $9,000 region, unless a large spike in buy volume emerges across all major exchanges.\nWhile the media has tried to justify the movement of the market with news such as Twitter imposing a ban on cryptocurrency ads, it is not logical to justify every price movement of the cryptocurrency market with news that often do not correlate with the market. The cryptocurrency market and hundreds of cryptocurrencies within it have moved up and down in a similar pattern altogether. \nIf it was news or a certain event that affected the cryptocurrency market, the market should have dropped or recovered after the event transpired. But, the drop nor the recovery correlated with the news such as social media platforms banning cryptocurrency ads.\nMomentum\nThe cryptocurrency market has lacked volume and momentum over the past few months. Some analysts state that the market is showing difficulty in recovering from a 72 percent correction, which has been the third largest correction to date for bitcoin, the most dominant cryptocurrency in the global market.\nIt is important to acknowledge that as with any asset or market, after a major correction, the cryptocurrency market is likely to slump for many months before beginning its rally. The current volumes on major exchanges signifies the small probability of the market to recover in the short-term. The market will likely remain extremely volatile in the next few weeks, until a large buy volume spikes and the market starts to pick up.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

ESMA also announced measures for binary options.\nThe measures will be published in the official journal of the EU and will take effect one month for binary options and two months for CFDs, following publication in the official journal.\nThe product intervention measures for CFDs include leverage limits on the opening of a CFD by a retail client from 30:1 to 2:1, which vary according to the volatility of the underlying asset. The leverage limits are: 30:1 for major currency pairs; 20:1 for non-major currency pairs, gold and major indices; 10:1 for commodities other than gold and non-major equity indices; 5:1 for individual equities and other reference values; and 2:1 for cryptocurrencies.\nOther intervention measures include the following:\n\nA margin closeout rule per account. This will standardize the percentage of margin at 50% of minimum initial required margin, mandating providers to close out one or more of a retail client\u2019s open CFDs.\nNegative balance protection per account basis. This will provide a guaranteed limit on retail client losses.\nA restriction on the incentives offered to trade CFDs.\nA risk warning, including the percentage of losses on a CFD provider\u2019s retail investor accounts, delivered in a standardized way.\n\nWhy The Measure\nCFDs that offer leveraged exposure to price, level or value changes in underlying asset classes have existed as a speculative short-term investment product for several years. In recent years, however, national competent authorities (NCAs) have raised concerns about the growth of CFDs to a mass retail market, despite these products being complex and inappropriate for most retail investors.\nNCA\u2019s analysis shows that 74% to 89% of retail investor accounts lose money on their investments, with average losses ranging from \u20ac1,600 to \u20ac29,000. While some NCAs have taken measures in this area, ESMA provides the most efficient tool to provide a common minimum level of protection.\nThe pricing, trading terms and settlement of such products are not standardized, undermining investors\u2019 ability to grasp the terms of the product. In addition, CFD providers often require investors to acknowledge that reference prices that determine the value of a CFD can differ from the available price.\nIt can also be difficult for retail investors to check the accuracy of the prices received from the CFD provider.\nCryptocurrencies Draw Concern\nCFDs with cryptocurrencies as an underlying asset raise significant concerns.\nESMA and NCAs are concerned about the integrity of the price formation process in underlying cryptocurrency markets, as they make it difficult for retail clients to value these products.\nDue to the specific characteristics of cryptocurrencies as an asset class, the market for financial instruments providing exposure to cryptocurrencies, such as CFDs, will be closely monitored.\nLack Of Clarity Cited\nRetail investors find it difficult to assess the expected performance of a CFD, the statement noted.\nIn addition to transaction fees, spreads and other charges can be applied.\nThe application of leverage, which is common to CFD components, can also increase the probability of a larger loss to a greater extent than the probability of a larger gain. High leverage also increases the likelihood that the investor has insufficient margin to support their open CFDs by making the investor\u2019s position sensitive to small fluctuations in the price.\nAutomatic margin close-out provides a degree of protection for investors as it reduces, but it does not eliminate, the risk that the investor loses all or more than their initial margin. The interaction between high leverage and automatic margin close-out increases the probability that an investor\u2019s position will be closed automatically by the CFD provider in a short time frame or an investor has to post additional margin in the hope of reversing a losing position.\nFurthermore, the offer of CFDs to retail investors has increasingly featured aggressive and misleading marketing practices. A common feature of CFD marketing and sales techniques has been the offer of bonuses to attract and encourage retail investors to invest in CFDs. Such bonuses can act as a distraction from the high-risk nature of the product.\nSuch offers to open CFD trading accounts often require investors to pay the provider and conduct a specified number of trades over a specified time period.\nConflicts of interest have arisen and may arise from the fact that some CFD providers are counterparties to investors\u2019 trades without hedging their exposure, therefore placing their interests in direct conflict with that of their investors.\nAlso read: IMF urges international cooperation on cryptocurrency regulation\nESMA To Monitor\nESMA intends to closely monitor whether similar detrimental consequences for retail investors develop from these products on a pan-European basis.\nSecuritized derivatives that are CFDs are not explicitly excluded from the definition of CFDs. While ESMA is not aware of securitized CFDs at this stage, the wrapper of a security and the tradability on a trading venue do not change the key characteristics of a CFD. Such products will be in the scope of this measure.\nESMA will assess whether stricter measures are required.\nBinary Options Prohibited\nESMA has decided to will impose a three-month prohibition on the marketing, distribution or sale of binary options to retail investors since the risks related to the inherent features of binary options, such as an expected negative return and inherent conflicts of interest, make these products unsuitable for retail investors.\nUnlike options which can serve a valuable role in hedging exposure to certain assets, binary options do not meet any genuine investment needs for retail investors. Such options can also attract compulsive gambling behavior.", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

A subsidiary of Dearborn,\u00a0Mich.-based Ford Motors has been granted a patent by the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a cryptocurrency-fueled technology\u00a0to power its cars. It\u2019s called the Cooperatively Managed Merge and Pass\u00a0(CMMP) It was filed in 2016 and was just granted to Ford Global Technologies.\nCMMP is a token-based system that operates within its own ecosystem but also out on the open road. It\u2019s a vehicle-to-vehicle or car-to-car communication platform on which \u2014 at the request of participating drivers and enabled by\u00a0GPS technology \u2014 cars can talk to one another about traffic patterns. The system would also monitor and collect data on drivers, which during a time when Facebook is being skewered for data sharing could raise some concerns.\n\u201cThe CMMP system operates with individual token-based transactions, where the merchant vehicles and the consumers\u2019 vehicles agree to trade units of cryptocurrency,\u201d according to the patent.\nIt gives the consumer vehicle \u201cpreferential lane access\u201d during periods of heavy congestion, allowing them to weave in and out of traffic for a price. The patent further explains: \u201cmerchant vehicles voluntarily occupy slower lanes of traffic to facilitated the consumer vehicle to merge into their lanes and pass as needed.\u201d\nMerchant vehicles are paid in CCMP tokens for giving the consumer vehicle the right of way. The price depends on the time advantage that the consumer vehicle is requesting.\nThe patent application explains\u00a0 \u2013\n\u201cFor example, a driver of a consumer vehicle which is running late for an appointment may request to pass any participating merchant vehicles for a duration of 10 minutes on a particular road or highway for 60 CMMP tokens, at a rate of 10 seconds preferential access per token.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t say whether other cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin or XRP, will also be supported.\nFord\u2019s Tech Push\nIt sounds like a project that could be part of a startup\u2019s ICO, but Ford, which has committed to invest USD 11 billion in electric vehicles by 2022, doesn\u2019t mention any fundraising plans.

General tax principles apply to property transactions that use virtual currency. This includes the following rules:\n\nA virtual currency payment is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property.\nVirtual currency payments to service providers and independent contractors are taxable, for which self-employment tax rules generally apply. Payers must normally issue Form 1099-MISC.\nWages paid in virtual currency are taxable to the employee and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes, and the employer must report them on Form W-2.\nCertain third parties settling payments in virtual currency on behalf of merchants accepting virtual currency have to report payments to those merchants on Form 1099-K, Payment Card and Third Party Network Transactions.\nThe character of loss or gain from the exchange or sale of virtual currency is based on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the taxpayer\u2019s hands.\n", "category": "Bitcoin Crime"}

Frustrated with the network\u2019s susceptibility to network congestion, Kik said last year that it would transfer its tokens to Stellar, whose federated consensus model allows for faster, cheaper payments.\nHowever, Stellar is far less liquid than Ethereum, so swapping blockchains would have come with its drawbacks. Recognizing this, Kik developed a way to deploy Kin in parallel on both blockchains \u2014 without increasing the total supply. Internal transactions with a single digital service will likely utilize the Stellar-based tokens, while external payments and exchange volume will probably occur primarily. on the Ethereum network.\nSrebnik wrote:\n\u201cWhile Ethereum provides liquidity for Kin holders, its load times and fees can\u2019t support our needs for day-to-day consumer use. The addition of Stellar as a second blockchain will allow us to operate the Kin Ecosystem on a faster, more efficient foundation, with low transaction fees\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is necessary for us to achieve the speed and scalability that digital services in the ecosystem will require.\u201d\nOnce the Stellar-based Kin token has been released and fully-initialized \u2014 which will occur later this year \u2014 users will be able to move their tokens between networks by locking them up on one and unlocking them on the other, presumably through a smart contract mechanism. Developers say that this will help ensure that the tokens maintain a stable value across the two networks.\nHowever, Srebnik said that developing this mechanism will likely take several months. He did not clarify whether this would lead to a delay in the release of the standalone Kin app, which will run on the Stellar blockchain.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

For any multi-billion dollar startup like Binance, the relocation of headquarters comes with difficulties, especially in regards to finances and regulatory conflicts. \nBut, it seems evident that the pro-blockchain attitude of Malta authorities has given Binance confidence to relocate its team and business to the region, placing Malta at the forefront of cryptocurrency growth.\nMalta, The Blockchain Island\nSilvio Schembri, Malta\u2019s Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy & Innovation, stated in an interview with the Binance team that the country remains confident in the work that is being done in the cryptocurrency sector. He further emphasized that Binance\u2019s presence in the region would continue to allow Malta to evolve into the Blockchain Island.\n\u201cThis is a clear vote of confidence in our country and the work being done in this sector, mainly by the latest policy launched to offer a regulatory framework of DLT operations. It is obvious that Malta has become a natural point of reference on the international sphere and companies such as Binance will continue to look into Malta to further expand their operations or establish a base. Binance\u2019s presence in Malta sustains our vision, that of making Malta \u2018The Blockchain Island,\u2019\u201d said Schembri.\nIn an official statement, the Binance team noted that Malta\u2019s existing regulations and pro-blockchain legislation for its local cryptocurrency businesses ultimately convinced the company to invest in the European nation, after visiting and evaluating several regions.\nChangpeng Zhao, the CEO at Binance who is better known as CZ, stated that the Binance team were inspired by the logical and forward-thinking nature of Schembri, and the rest of the Malta government.\n\u201cAfter meeting with Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Silvio Schembri, we were impressed by the logical, clear and forward-thinking nature of Malta\u2019s leadership. After reviewing a proposal bill, we are convinced that Malta will be the next hotbed for innovative blockchain companies and a centre of the blockchain ecosystem in Europe. Binance is committed to lending our expertise to help shape a healthy regulatory framework as well as providing funds for other blockchain start-ups to grow the industry further in Malta,\u201d Zhao said.\nInfluence on Other Regions\nRecently, South Korean authorities have started to discuss the possibility of legalizing domestic initial coin offerings (ICOs) once again, after Kakao, the country\u2019s largest internet conglomerate that operates KakaoTalk, KakaoPay, KakaoStory, KakaoStock, and KakaoTaxi, the country\u2019s largest app that have nearly 90 percent market share of the messaging, payment, social media, online stock brokerage, and taxi service markets, revealed its plans to move its blockchain venture outside of South Korea.\nInevitably, startups and multi-billion dollar conglomerates will relocate to regions that are equipped with pro-blockchain legislature and are led by forward-thinking regulators. Malta\u2019s warm welcome of cryptocurrency businesses and exchanges will likely influence other regions, like Japan and South Korea, to continue providing sound regulations to businesses to ensure their markets can grow exponentially, without regulatory conflicts.", "category": "Bitcoin Business"}

The utility has received an order to await instructions from the government.\n\u201cIn recent months, we have received projects representing several thousand megawatts,\u201d said a recent follow-up document sent by Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec to some blockchain contractors.\nBlockchain Contractors Won\u2019t Be Served\nHydro-Quebec\u00a0has advised some blockchain contractors it will not be able to supply them with electricity. The utility noted it is developing guidelines for supplying projects, taking into account the needs of other customers and limiting rate increases to the level of inflation.\nProjects have requested amounts of electricity that are 5,000% above that of the average home consumption, in some cases exceeding that of aluminum smelters, Remy noted.\nPierre Moreau, the Quebec Minister of Energy, stated that blockchain projects request high amounts of electricity without creating many jobs \u2013 sometimes two or three jobs \u2013 whereas aluminum smelters create hundreds of jobs.\nMoreau said the government wants to assure residents that it will not tell them they cannot provide electricity during peak winter energy use periods because of cryptocurrency mining.\nA Change In Direction\nThe new position diverges from the utility\u2019s previous efforts to attract companies using large amounts of electricity, such as bitcoin miners, Remy observed. The utility\u2019s goal was to double revenue to nearly $30 billion by 2030 based on strategies dedicated to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nThe utility\u2019s initial strategy was effective, considering the arrival of American cloud technology giants such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, Remy noted. For the fifth consecutive year, the utility will pay a dividend exceeding $2 billion to shareholders, according to its CEO, Eric Martel.\nQuebec has succumbed to the fraudulent, purely speculative and ecologically irresponsible impression of digital currencies portrayed by the general media and traditional economists, Remy observed.\nHostile To New Technology\nThe founder of Academie Bitcoin, a Montreal bitcoin consultancy, is not surprised by a counterproductive political directive concerning cryptocurrencies, given the government\u2019s hostility to technological change, Remy noted.\nThis has been demonstrated by its attempt to ban Uber and to tax web giants.\nRegulatory moves in the European Union appear to be inspiring these moves, Remy noted.\nJonathan Hamel, a Quebec entrepreneur and tech industry advocate, said the Couillard government has undermined investment projects in Quebec, and that the companies have contingency plans to establish operations elsewhere, particularly in Alberta.\nHamel said the players are extremely mobile, and many gas and oil producers are ready to host mining fueled by fossil resources that are hard to export elsewhere than in the United States.\nA \u2018Campaign Of Fear\u2019\nHamel called the Couillard government\u2019s actions a \u201ccampaign of fear\u201d that contradicts what previous governments have sought to achieve for 20 years \u2014 technological investments that will diversify the economy that depends on natural resources.\nThe Couillard government prevents investment of private capital in closed factories, said Hamel, who claims the government\u2019s opposition is more ideological than factual. He said bitcoin mining presents an incentive to use clean, renewable energy.\nBitfarms, which operates bitcoin farms, hopes the Couillard government considers the economic ramifications in the creation of any tariffs.\nBitfarms currently employs 80 people and plans to add another 300 in 2018 on a full-time basis, depending on available electricity if tariffs do not rise, according to the company\u2019s public relations director, Bahador Zabihiyan.\nBitfarms data centers create three jobs per MW. Positions include engineers, programmers, electricians and analysts, with an average salary of $55,163, with benefits.\nIn its agreement with Hydro-Sherbrooke and Hydro-Magog, Bitfarms agreed to use only surplus electricity and to unplug the machines if necessary during the high consumption winter period.\nAlso read: Quebec premier disses bitcoin miners seeking cheap power rates in Canada\nUtililty Uses Alarmist Data\nThe crypto mining energy consumption figures released by Hydro-Quebec, from 3,000 to 10,000 MW, are alarmist and hypothetical, and would make it difficult for a miner to be profitable, said\u00a0Zabihiyan, adding that it is a shame to use such numbers in the negotiations.\nAuctioning energy blocks to help players with a short-term strategy would be a worst-case scenario for Hydro-Quebec since it would help players with a short-term strategy, Zabihiyan observed. A company like Bitfarms wants to invest for a longer term and would not be able to outbid players with a short-term strategy.", "category": "Accepts Bitcoin"}

Such systems, the bureau wrote, are most useful for departments in which central gatekeeping is expensive (such as when staff must manually verify transactions) and there is less than total trust between different parties in the ecosystem.\nThe bureau also recommended that departments staff their projects with DLT skeptics and non-technical people to put the proposed system \u201cthrough a gauntlet\u201d to determine whether it is truly useful.\n\u201cInclude both blockchain skeptics and non-technical people. A team comprised of only pro-blockchain people can be blinded by the hype and force a square peg into a round hole. Putting blockchain technology through a gauntlet to see if it reaches the other side is the best thing we can do to understand its usefulness.\u201d\nSimilarly, the post advised developers to devote extensive time to interviewing stakeholders rather than leaping straight into producing the system. The BFS said that its team spent nearly half of the project analyzing its processes to discover friction points that make its current systems costly, time-consuming, and inefficient.\nAs CCN reported, the Treasury\u2019s blockchain pilot program began in October and sought to utilize DLT-based systems to track physical assets such as computers and smartphones, and agency officials praised the technology\u2019s ability to reduce fraud and increase efficiency.\nThough not directly related, the Treasury\u2019s financial crimes division has been tasked with enforcing President Trump\u2019s recent executive order barring US citizens and residents from engaging with the \u201cPetro,\u201d a state-backed cryptocurrency issued by Venezuela.

Apart from some small cryptocurrencies like Ontology and Ethos, most cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have recorded a slight decline in value.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum Keep Yesterday\u2019s Levels\nSince March 25, both Ethereum and bitcoin have struggled to record any major gains or losses. The price of bitcoin declined slightly from $8,580 to $8,490, by just over 1 percent. Over the past 24 hours, bitcoin\u2019s daily trading volume has been $4.5 billion, which is three times larger than that of Ethereum.\nBut, Ethereum has not been able to sustain a high daily trading volume. In fact, Tether, a cryptocurrency that is hedged to the value of the US dollar, has been the second most liquid cryptocurrency in the market, with a daily trading volume of $1.4 billion.\nTether is always an interesting indicator to consider when evaluating the state of the cryptocurrency market because the vast majority of cryptocurrency traders use Tether, instead of fiat money, to hedge the value of cryptocurrencies.\nBinance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, process cryptocurrency-to-Tether pairings, allowing users to hedge cryptocurrencies in periods of extreme volatility. Often, abnormally high daily trading volume of Tether signifies instability in the cryptocurrency market, and an increase in the number of users hedging the value of cryptocurrencies to reserve currencies.\nA few days ago, CCN reported that Changpeng Zhao, the CEO at Binance, stated volumes are back on most exchanges. Still, in comparison to early March when the price of bitcoin reached $11,700, the trading volume of bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum remain quite low.\nPremiums in the South Korean and Hong Kong cryptocurrency markets are also an important metric to utilize to measure the demand in the two markets. In South Korea, bitcoin is being traded at $8,723, which is 3.2 percent higher than the US market. On Gatecoin, a cryptocurrency brokerage that processes bitcoin-to-cryptocurrency trades for Hong Kong investors, the price of bitcoin remains in the $9,000 region.\nHence, the demand from major regions is still there, given that premiums still remain high in Hong Kong and South Korea. After the crackdown on cryptocurrency trading, most Chinese traders moved to the Hong Kong market to trade cryptocurrencies.\nAlt Season\nIt is certainly too early to conclude whether the alternative cryptocurrency season has begun. But, several small-scale cryptocurrencies have outperformed bitcoin over the past few days. Today, Ontology and Ethos both recorded a 20 percent gain over bitcoin, while Nebilo and Waltonchain have consistently outperformed bitcoin throughout the past 5 days.\nIt is plausible that altcoins are gaining popularity because they have generally performed poor against bitcoin throughout February and March. Until the market recovers and major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin achieves $12,000, Ethereum rebounds to $900, and Ripple recovers to $1, it seems unlikely that altcoins will be able to continuously outperform bitcoin.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Most of the involvements in the blockchain ecosystem are perceived to be motivated by curiosity and the opportunity to earn value. However, the actual reasons behind this increasing growth is practically due to increased implementation of the technology across different works of life.\nAn industry where blockchain technology is beginning to gain traction and significance is the healthcare industry. Healthcare is one of the most essential aspects of human existence and an area of life that is given significant attention, especially in developed nations. As a matter of fact, in most cases, the level of development of a people is determined by the healthcare index within their society.\nAn unbalanced society\nDeveloping nations are receiving a lot of attention as well in the healthcare industry. This is evident in the amount of aids and support that flow in their direction from the more developed nations and other global institutions. Apart from the humanitarian services rendered, the developmental factors of a healthy society justifies the processes involved in supporting the healthcare industry in developing nations.\nThere are lots of interconnected processes in the global healthcare solutions industry. The way and manner by which these processes are implemented go a long way to determine the results achieved. Unfortunately, contrary to expectations, there is a huge imbalance in the accessibility levels of these services.\nAccessing modern healthcare services and being able to participate in the investment towards research and development within this sector has remained an exclusive privilege of a limited group of individuals. For instance, it is very common to find wealthy Africans travel to Europe and America for healthcare processes as trivial as routine medical check-ups and childbirth. Also, information about health fund arrangements in existence does not even make it to the hearing of most global citizens who are more concerned about surviving till the next day.\nMaking healthcare accessible\nFew companies are already taking advantage of blockchain technology to decentralize the healthcare industry and providing a level playing ground for the global audience. A typical example of this development is the services provided by Trustedhealth. The platform provides patients, medical practitioners and other service providers within the industry and opportunity to connect directly with one another.\nThe already existing Trustedoctor platform connects patients directly with specialists across the globe without the extra travel cost and other logistics. This, therefore, eliminates the existing geographical barriers that sideline majority of the public from first-class medical services.\nIn terms of health funds and the associated benefits, localization and lack of spread of information is keeping this sector within a closed circle. Several research and developments are ongoing within the healthcare industry, especially in the area of biotechnology. These research and developments are focused on finding more effective solutions especially to the critical health issues that currently exist.\nFunding for these projects usually come from humanitarian sources and private investments. The investments are associated with benefits that extend to as much as preferential medicare solutions. As mentioned above, due to the current setup of these systems, a lot of people are cut off from participating.\nHealth funds investment platform VanHealthing and other related projects, are implementing the decentralized blockchain technology to break the existing monopoly within the industry. The project claims to work towards reforming the biotech industry by opening up access to critical products and solutions and making investment more transparent. On the blockchain, information is available for all to see and anyone from anywhere can contribute to health funds and enjoy the associated benefits.\nA technology for the masses\nOther areas where blockchain technology is finding significant implementation in the healthcare industry includes the pharmaceutical sector where blockchain can be used to track and monitor the supply chain of medical products. Immutable record keeping also guarantees the consistency of the medical records of patients across the globe.\nBlockchain is\u00a0seen as a technology for the masses and a universal leveler. Its decentralization property enables unrestricted access and participation to information, products and services.

Dubbed the UBCI (Upbit Crypto Index), the index will be measured from four market indices based on long-term transactional data at the exchange by calculating standard values in confidence intervals, Business Korea reports.\nThe four indices developed are as follows:\n\nMarket Index: A total cryptocurrency marketcap-weighted index that factors the market\u2019s total liquidity ratio while providing investors an overview of all coins.\nSector Index: An index that will classify coins in their own specific sectors based on their characteristics.\nBitcoin Index: An index focusing on bitcoin trading prices in the market; and\nStrategy Index: A rule-based index to serve as an indicator of quantitative investors rules and tracking yields of investors\u2019 crypto portfolios.\n\nAs reported previously in September, Upbit was first announced by FinTech startup Dunnamu \u2013 the operator of the country\u2019s most popular stock trading app Kakao Stock as a comprehensive new trading platform with support over a hundred cryptocurrencies. An affiliate of Kakao Corp, Dunamu launched Upbit in beta the following month. Dunamu enabled Upbit traders to connect with other Kako apps including Kakao Talk, the country\u2019s most popular messaging app used by 93% of South Korea\u2019s population and Kakao Pay, a mobile payment platform with over 13 million users.\nWithin months of its launch, Upbit quickly became Korea\u2019s leading cryptocurrency trading operator. Market data released by a politician from Korea\u2019s ruling Democratic party last month revealed Upbit accounted for over half of the country\u2019s cryptocurrency trading market at 52.9%.\nMarketplace data of bitcoin trading in Korea over the last 24 hours shows a similar picture.\nSource: BraveNewCoin\nFollowing the notable announcement of the new indices, Dunamu president Lee Seok-woo drew parallels between the nascent current stage of the cryptocurrency market with traditional financial markets. In doing so, he underlined the need for investor indices.\nHe stated:\nThe present situation of the cryptocurrency market is quite similar to the traditional financial market based on stocks and bonds in its early stage. Accordingly, as the market gets more sophisticated, the UBCI is expected to play an important role in this area in the future. We will also disclose the index rulebook and let the market evaluate it before long.\nUpbit intends to launch three indices as soon as April, followed by an unscheduled launch date later in the year for its Strategy Index.", "category": "Bitcoin Trading"}

The court went on to note that the cryptocurrency is a legitimate transferable value.\n\u201cBitcoin exists, according to the court, from a unique, digitally encrypted series of numbers and letters stored on the hard drive of the right-holder\u2019s computer. Bitcoin is \u2018delivered\u2019 by sending bitcoins from one wallet to another wallet. Bitcoins are stand-alone value files, which are delivered directly to the payee by the payer in the event of a payment. It follows that a Bitcoin represents a value and is transferable. In the court\u2019s view, it thus shows characteristics of a property right. A claim for payment in Bitcoin is therefore to be regarded as a claim that qualifies for verification,\u201d the court document translated by Cointelegraph read.\nDifferences in Bitcoin Regulation\nIn the US, cryptocurrencies are considered as commodities, at least by the US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In Japan, the government acknowledged cryptocurrencies as a legal currency, allowing citizens and businesses to utilize cryptocurrencies to send and receive money. In the Philippines, cryptocurrencies are seen as a remittance method, that provides an efficient method for transaction settlement.\nGenerally, while cryptocurrencies as a whole are considered as different types of assets or money, they are considered legitimate by most governments. The Dutch court, if it had decided cryptocurrencies was not a legitimate transferable value, it would have requested the company to pay the proceeds in Euros. However, that was not the case, as the court specifically ordered the business to pay 0.591 bitcoin to the petitioner.\nIn many regions, the legality of bitcoin still remains unclear. In India for instance, the government has offered no additional information apart from an ambiguous message that bitcoin is neither legal or illegal. Consequently, businesses have integrated their own Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems, to stay compliant with the country\u2019s existing regulations on financial companies, which can highly impractical and costly.\nEurope\nHowever, in Europe, at least within the EU, bitcoin is considered as an asset and a transferable value. In the recent G20 Summit, an international forum participated by the 20 leading economies of the world, global financial watchdog Financial Stability Board (FSB) emphasized that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are considered assets, and they do not pose danger to the stability of the global financial industry.\n\u201cThe FSB\u2019s initial assessment is that crypto-assets do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time. The market continues to evolve rapidly, however, and this initial assessment could change if crypto-assets were to become significantly more widely used or interconnected with the core of the regulated financial system,\u201d read the statement of the FSB.\nConclusively, if the global cryptocurrency market and businesses within it continue to function as a strictly regulated market with compliant businesses, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin will always be considered as legitimate assets.", "category": "Bitcoin & Blockchain Investments"}

While Facebook continues to reel from a security breach involving the personal data of tens of millions of users, they may just have demonstrated the value of an unalterable public ledger, aka blockchain. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves thinks so, according to a recent segment on CNBC, and he just may be onto something.\nCybersecurity is something that risk management teams continue to struggle to get ahead of, and the latest incident at Facebook is an example of just how damaging a breach can be. If you didn\u2019t hear, a third-party data analytical company distributed without permission a heap of personal information it had scraped on millions of Facebook users. Facebook attempted to sweep it all under the rug, and now Mark Zuckerberg has offered a mea culpa.\nFacebook on the blockchain would create a more secure world for its billions of users. Zuckerberg has kind of backed himself into a corner if he chooses to ignore the technology, given the backlash he\u2019s received from the security breach, as evidenced by USD 40 billion slashed from the internet darling\u2019s market cap.\nMatter of Trust\nBut it\u2019s more than just investor backlash. Wall Street and London\u2019s financial district are questioning whether Facebook could survive another security incident, not to mention the response that the company could trigger from regulators. As a Wells Fargo analyst noted, \u201cFacebook has since upgraded its user privacy functionality and app review process to prevent similar abuse.\u201d But what if it\u2019s too little, too late?\nIn the event of greater regulatory oversight, you could expect to see changes to your Facebook newsfeed, not to mention the ads that appear. Facebook has already issued a ban that extends to ICO and cryptocurrency ads.\nIt brings to the forefront an important point surrounding whether blockchain technology could have prevented an incident like this from happening in the first place.\nBig Tech & Blockchain\nOn a day when Google unveiled its plans to develop its own blockchain, big tech is starting to realize they can\u2019t stick their heads in the sand about blockchain any longer. Facebook on the blockchain, while a step in the right direction, wouldn\u2019t submerge social media into decentralized territory. The company, not its users, controls the platform, and it would continue to do so even if posts were made on an unalterable, global online database like the blockchain.\nBut according to RBC\u2019s Steves, what the blockchain would do is add another layer of transparency to the social media platform, so that users could monitor their data \u2014 whether it\u2019s a post, picture or location \u2014 and know precisely whose hands it ends up in. Where a centralized blockchain falls short,\u00a0however, is putting the originator of that data in the driver\u2019s seat so that they could decide who gets to see the data and who doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cYou could 100% track all this stuff\u2026 if you use blockchain technology in the Facebook example.. you could track every single time that photo is sent. So let\u2019s say I only wanted my mother to see it. I could see if she sent it to somebody else because there would be a digital footprint to track it. The problem that it does not solve if you use it in a centralized environment is it doesn\u2019t stop them from doing it though.\u201d\u00a0 \u2013 Steves on CNBC\nIn the case of the 2016 US presidential election, which is what Facebook\u2019s latest data breach involved, blockchain could have meant that voters were not blindsided by the fact that their data had likely caught on like wildfire.", "category": "Blockchain News"}

There is widespread fear that China will retaliate and financial market across the world will be plunged into further turmoil.\nThe Dow Jones was down 724.42 points for the day, which represents a 2.93% decrease. Analysts\u00a0expect there to be further decreases before the weekend. Some are even going so far as to say this could represent the beginning of a reversal of the multi-year bull trend responsible for the record highs of the past few months.\nThe question on a lot of people\u2019s minds is whether or not the falling Dow Jones present an opportunity for cryptocurrencies.\nWhy is this trade war such a big deal?\nWhile President Trump has been threatening the introduction of trade tariffs for some time, they have finally become a reality. He wants to create a more protectionist economy whereby home-grown businesses can reap the benefits of this change in policy.\nChina has been one of his main targets since taking office, as he blames them for causing significant damage to US manufacturers and employment. \u00a0There is no doubting that China will not take this move lightly.\nHow could this trade war be good for cryptocurrencies?\nWhile tariffs may appear to be a good idea on paper as they should protect the economy, in reality, it generally only ends up benefitting a small segment of the economy, with the rest of it suffering.\nThe US Dollar will weaken as a result of this approach, and it may open up a move for more institutions to conduct transactions using cryptocurrencies.\nRather than having to deal with a weakening US Dollar, people may turn to using cryptocurrencies for their transactions and to store their wealth.\nBitcoin,\u00a0for example, has been dubbed \u201cdigital gold\u201d and it is at volatile times that investors put their money in more conservative investments such as that of gold. Gold will usually retain its value as the financial markets worsen.\nCryptocurrencies may also be used to get around the trade restrictions that are in place. This means that significant fees and penalties can be avoided (albeit illegally) and transactions can go on as normal.\nIf the use of crypto becomes common practice, many institutions will realize the many benefits associated with this approach and may not return to fiat currencies when volatility in those markets has stabilized.\nAn event like this trade war could be the catalyst for a more significant and widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange.\nHow might this not work out for cryptocurrencies?\nIn the world of finance, there are never any guarantees. There has been a massive bull market in the traditional financial word for many years now, with money being awash for institutional investors to spend as they please.\nMany had the spare capital to invest in somewhat riskier investments, such as that of cryptocurrencies. However, if this trade war triggers a sustained bear market, this could lead to investments drying up in the crypto sector, dragging it into a bear market with the rest of the economy.\nIn a previous article, I theorized that that as financial market fears increase, the price of bitcoin decreases and vice versa. So far, I\u2019ve been right.\nWhatever happens, this will be fascinating to watch to see how the crypto markets react to sustained levels of turbulence in traditional financial markets as the United States and China battle it out in a trade war.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

The entire cryptocurrency market has dropped $25 billion, and analysts suspect that the abrupt market decline was fueled by FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) surrounding Binance.\nMarket Slumps\nEarlier this week, Japanese mainstream media outlet Nikkei reported that Binance was warned by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) for serving local investors on its platform. Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency-only exchange, operates internationally serving millions of users in different regions. Hence, it is obvious that users in Japan could trade on the Binance trading platform, as they can trade on Upbit, Bittrex, Poloniex, or any other cryptocurrency-only exchanges.\nHowever, Nikkei reported that criminal charges will be filed against Binance if the exchange \u201cfails to halt Japan operations,\u201d and the misrepresentation of the situation led the market to panic. Changpeng Zhao, the CEO at Binance, released a statement to reassure its users and investors that the report of Nikkei was irresponsible, and that the Binance team has been communicating with the FSA for awhile.\n\u201cNikkei showed irresponsible journalism. We are in constructive dialogs with Japan FSA, and have not received any mandates. It does not make sense for JFSA to tell a newspaper before telling us, while we have an active dialog going on with them,\u201d wrote CZ. \u201cNo need to worry. Some negative news often turn out to be positive in the long term. Chinese have a proverb for this. New (often better) opportunities always emerge during times of change.\u201d\nAlmost immediately after the Binance situation was made public, the market dropped $25 billion. But, while the Binance FUD may have contributed to the decline of the cryptocurrency market, it also could have been coincidence, as it is not realistic to claim that an exchange\u2019s compliance with one region led the market to decline by around 10 percent overnight.\nThroughout the past few weeks, the cryptocurrency market has demonstrated a similar pattern in that the market has declined 10 to 15 percent, recovered from the correction, and drop again by 5 to 10 percent. It is more likely that whales in the cryptocurrency market are manipulating the price of cryptocurrencies, especially those with weak volumes, than a single exchange in Binance causing the market to fall.\nThe Binance situation can also be considered as a positive movement for the company, given that this will provide opportunity for Binance to operate legitimately, as a regulated financial service provider within Japan, to serve the second largest cryptocurrency exchange market in Japan.\nShort-Term Trend\nIf Binance was the sole cause of the recent correction, the market should have bounced back immediately after Binance CEO CZ and the company issued statements to clear the FUD. However, the market has stayed in the same position over the past 12 hours, and bitcoin still hovering around $8,500.\nAs bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies did last week, once volumes begin to pick up on large exchanges, the cryptocurrency market will likely be able to recover to its previous level.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Le Maire pointed out that France, along with Germany, called for cryptocurrencies to placed on G20\u2019s agenda.\nThe minister revealed that France will start working on cryptocurrency regulations before the rest of the world, in a bid to put Europe at the forefront of the digital economy. As covered, G20 has called for cryptocurrency regulation recommendations by July this year, seemingly confirming rumblings of a crackdown on cryptocurrencies are out of the picture.\nLe Maire, like most of the world\u2019s leaders, added that cryptocurrencies may be used in illicit activities, but noted that he \u201cfirmly believes this technology is very positive for every country.\u201d For that to happen, however, \u201cwe need to have regulations, and Europe will lead the process.\u201d\nAccording to a report published by Brazilian news outlet Criptomoedas F\u00e1cil, the minister didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of seeing central banks issue their own cryptocurrencies \u2013 an idea that\u2019s been entertained by central bankers throughout the world. If these come, he implied, they will come after the sector is regulated.\nLe Maire notably pointed out he believes financial technology is crucial for the \u201cmarket to develop in the best possible way.\u201d Per his words, cryptocurrencies are a part of said development. He said (roughly translated):\n\u201cWe agree that crypto-assets can be very interesting for everyone. And we \u2013 obviously \u2013 are in favor of blockchain technology, which can provide very good support to financial assets in Europe or anywhere in the world. We are in favor of these technologies, but we want these technologies to be secure and therefore we need to define very clear measures for their regulation. \u201c\nThe French minister\u2019s words seemingly echo those of Spain\u2019s economy minister Rom\u00e1n Escolano Olivares, who at G20 stated that he doesn\u2019t see cryptocurrencies as a threat to the global financial system, and revealed the European Union will not wait for a global agreement to regulate cryptos.\nAs covered by CCN, Le Maire announced a cryptocurrency task force earlier this year, chaired by a former central banker. At the time, he stated:\n\u201cWe want a stable economy: we reject the risks of speculation and the possible financial diversions linked to bitcoin. I have just entrusted Jean-Pierre Landau, former deputy governor of the Banque de France, with a mission on cryptocurrencies.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

If WENN decides to issue more than 100 million tokens, Kodak will receive three percent of all tokens created above that mark.\nNotably, however, WENN admits in the light paper that it is not sure whether the KodakCoin tokens fall under US federal securities regulations.

Regulators want to make sure as many as 100 crypto hedge funds are delivering what they promise to investors, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.\nPrivate hedge funds are not new to SEC scrutiny, as the sophisticated trading strategies have kept them on the radar of regulators before. For instance, fund managers must be careful how they market their funds, as the novice investor might not understand the risks they are inheriting with such trades.\nOne popular strategy is long/short, in which fund managers bet both on the prospects of a stock\u2019s rise and its decline, adding layers of debt to the trade. This strategy recently made its way to hedge fund investing, with firms like Genesis Capital lending bitcoins to institutional investors for short-term trades, giving fund managers hedging capabilities in the cryptocurrency market.\nIn the United States, only accredited investors are allowed in. The SEC already has hedge funds with more than USD 150 million in assets under its purview, but it has the jurisdiction to poke any private fund it wants to.\nSEC\u2019s Crackdown\nMeanwhile, the SEC has already been cracking down on initial coin offerings (ICOs), including a number of them that are being investigated by the Wall Street regulator. Now it\u2019s expanded the scope of its effort, as it looks to protect investors from deals that seem to circumvent securities laws.\nAccording to the WSJ story, regulators appear to merely be looking for how their policies could apply to bitcoin hedge funds. If they notice anything sketchy, of course, they could take further action.\nChief among the SEC\u2019s priorities is to ensure that hedge funds are delivering the type of exposure that fund managers outline in their investment papers. Another worry is the risk of a security breach in digital wallets at an exchange, such as the one that rattled Japan\u2019s Coincheck in January in which hundreds of millions of NEM were hacked.\nHedge funds could begin to hear from regulators about the process in Q2.\nHedge Fund Performance\nHedge funds more broadly had losses in February, and cryptocurrency hedge funds were no exception.\nAccording to HFR, which tracks hedge fund performance and also has its own blockchain index, cryptocurrency hedge funds managed to recover from their lowest levels last month, during which time the blockchain index shed 9.5%.", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

Although this are quite good news for people generally, I can also see it as a massive blow for so many altcoins.\nTrust me when I say there is an enormous storm coming.\n\nGDPR \u2013 What\u2019s Important to Retain\nThere are many important rules companies must follow starting from June 2018, that will actively protect customers against corporations data theft and abuse (ie, selling your data without your consent or creating complicated terms and agreements most users do not fully understand). I advise you to read through the whole thing especially if you (like me) work in IT, are responsible for an IT department or have your own startup; but there\u2019s one single point I believe to be most destructive for many cryptocurrencies:\n\nYes indeed, each user has the right to be forgotten, meaning, all user data should be able to get permanently deleted. Let\u2019s say if I chose to delete my facebook account, anything I have ever posted, commented, liked, etc has to disappear. It does seem simple when you own your own infrastructure, but due to one of the most important properties of blockchain technology being\u00a0its immutability, you can already see the problem bubbling up.\nAny platform that uses a distributed ledger to store user data (blockchain, ethereum) is, by all means, screwed. There is absolutely no way around this. What if companies just ignore this new enforcement? The fine will be calculated at 4% of your company\u2019s revenue, or 20 Million Euros, whichever is higher.\nSo if you have invested in a project, own a project or are generally interested in better understanding how this market will evolve, please do pay attention to the following: storing any user data on any public distributed ledger is half-way to a really, really, really unpleasantly expensive outcome.\nFrom the top 100 cryptocurrencies, how many can you identify that will face issues due to this new regulation? Platforms that hold user data in any form must assure there is a way for that data to be deleted. Let me underline this again: it means a big no-no to storing any user data on a ledger from where that data cannot be deleted.\nWhat about other rules?\nOther key changes can be followed without compromising the concept of immutable distributed ledger technology. If you want more information on the subject I highly advise you to read this article. All these points are explained brilliantly by the author. If you want a more in-depth understanding of how this problem could be avoided see this one. In short, you would have to consider off-chain storing of data; this is, centralized servers.\nNow what?\nRaise awareness, speak to members of projects where you\u2019re heavily invested and try to read as much as possible on the subject. Learning is the only way you\u2019ll ever feel safe. Your opinion is the one you should value the most, as there is no one who will look-out better for yourself than\u2026 well, yourself!", "category": "Bitcoin Law"}

He pointed to recent performance in BTC, whose value has been slashed in half since December 2017.\nIn keeping with the country\u2019s focus on fintech\u00a0innovation, Le Maire suggested a Visa program for ICO companies that meet certain criteria.\n\u201cFrance has every interest in becoming the first major financial center to propose an\u00a0ad hoc\u00a0legislative framework\u00a0that will allow companies initiating an ICO to demonstrate their seriousness to potential investors.\u201d\nHe ended his comments with a call to his G20 colleagues to share in the responsibility of security to foster innovation, as development cannot occur in a \u201cregulatory vacuum.\u201d As for France, they \u201cwill not miss the blockchain revolution.\u201d Vive la France!", "category": "News"}

Ontario-based cryptocurrency exchange The Board of Arbitrade is buying what\u2019s believed to be the last remaining set of gold artifacts comprised of Mr. Mandela\u2019s hands for $10 million in bitcoin.\nThe set, which weighs 20 pounds of 99.999 pure gold, is comprised of\u00a0a trio\u00a0of \u201clife-size impressions\u201d of\u00a0Mr. Mandela\u2019s hands and\u00a0a pair with his palm and fist.\u00a0Malcolm Duncan, a Canadian entrepreneur who knew Mandela, is the seller and reportedly paid 3.6 million South African Rand for the set to Harmony Gold Mining, which cast the items in 2002. Duncan couldn\u2019t turn them over until striking a deal with the cryptocurrency exchange, he seems a little skittish about transacting in cryptocurrencies.\nThe gold artifacts are a treasure for many reasons, not the least of which is because they are one of a series of 27 sets \u2014 each one of which reflecting a year that Mr. Mandela was imprisoned. Duncan owned every set of the golden hands for each year between 1964 and 1990,\u00a0from when Mandela entered the prison cell block to when he was eventually freed before becoming South Africa\u2019s first black president. The other gold pieces are said to no longer exist, at the behest of Mr. Mandela.\nGolden Hands of Nelson Mandela Tour\nTo understand why the exchange would want the golden hands, it helps to know a little more about the trading platform. They are developing a\u00a0cryptocurrency mining operation for their own coin as well as support trading of other cryptocurrencies. Their Dignity (DIG) coin will be backed by gold.\nThe golden hands are not yet paid in full, as the exchange has provided a $50,000 deposit in bitcoin\u00a0that has since been converted to fiat money, according to reports. The buyer and seller agreed to a schedule in which the exchange will make quarterly payments of\u00a0$2 million per piece in the set. But the exchange doesn\u2019t get the physical items until physical money converted from bitcoin is deposited into the seller\u2019s account.\n\u201cAt two-and-a-quarter million at a time, they take one hand at a time,\u201d according to Duncan quoted in Bloomberg.\nThe timing of The Board of Arbitrage\u2019s acquisition is serendipitous, as the former owner agreed to part with the gold-cast hands just weeks ahead of the exchange\u2019s upcoming ICO.

In fact, many investors treated these two companies as \u201cproxy stocks\u201d for the cryptocurrency industry.\nWhile the release of an Ethereum ASIC miner may not cause mining-related demand for GPUs to evaporate \u2014 Monero, for instance, has promised to alter its mining algorithm regularly to maintain ASIC-resistance \u2014 it could have a noticeable effect on AMD\u2019s revenue in particular.\nIn fact, AMD warned in its recently-published annual filing that GPU demand could be \u201cmaterially adversely affected\u201d if miners stopped buying.\nConsequently, Susquehanna has reduced its price target for AMD shares to $7.50 from $13 and Nvidia shares to $200 from $215.", "category": "Ethereum News"}

That\u2019s why it was a surprise today when Coinbase\u2018s latest announcement came not with a bang but a bearish whimper. Prices are down across the board today and there has been very little reaction to Coinbases momentous announcement. Whether or not the market chooses to react in the next 24 hours, one thing is for sure. Coinbase\u2019s addition of ERC20 support will have wide-reaching effects around the cryptocurrency markets for years to come and cannot be overlooked.\nWhat is ERC20?\nERC20 is the standard used by Ethereum tokens and\u00a0smart contracts. It serves as an interface to which anyone wishing to issue a token or write a smart contract must comply. There are a total of\u00a059,948 Ethereum contracts out there. Although Ethereum\u2019s market share has shrunk, they almost single-handedly\u00a0dominated the ICO bull market of 2017.\nFor instance, many of the most successful currencies such as EOS\u00a0which raised $185 million in just 5 days, Bancor\u00a0which raised $153 million, and at least 2 more that raised $70 million or more. ERC20 tokens are seen as the bedrock of ICOs, and blockchain applications by fans of Ethereum.\nHow will this affect Coinbase?\nCoinbase has a number of products this will affect. The first, and potentially the most important for institutional investors is Coinbase Custody. While unfamiliar to many retail investors, Coinbase Custody is a digital asset custody service that provides secure storage and financial controls of large holdings. No one knows how many customers are using custody, but it is seen as the most prominent digital asset custodian in the U.S. Therefore, the addition of ERC20 tokens might open up the door for a more diverse set of cryptocurrency trusts.\nGDAX, Coinbase\u2019s digital asset trading platform, which currently only supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash will \u201cwait for additional regulatory clarity\u201d before adding more assets. It\u2019s unclear what this means, in what jurisdictions they are seeking more guidance on regulation, or what their legal concerns are. Coinbase also has not established a timeline on this so whether or not it happens in 2018 is up for speculation.\nCoinbase, the companies flagship product will continue following the process it instituted after the Bitcoin Cash insider trading scandal and price pump of only adding coins to Coinbase\u00a0after they have been listed on GDAX.\nCoinbase Asset Management, the companies index fund, will include any new assets on a market capitalization basis. I.e. if you invest $100,000 and new ERC 20 Token x has 20% of the market cap of coins on Coinbase,\u00a0 you will own $20,000 of token x.\nCoinbase also announced that their payment processing product, Coinbase Commerce, has no plans at all to accept payments in any other cryptocurrencies. This is obviously a blow to all of the coins wishing to be used for real-time transactions but highlights the cautious approach the company is taking.\nHow will this affect CryptoMarkets?\nThe move has failed to give the markets any confidence with the total market capitalization down around $30 billion. The move couldn\u2019t even boost Ethereum which is odwn almost 10% today. I could be wrong, but I think if this move had come when the market cap was at $700 billion reactions would have been stronger.", "category": "Ethereum News"}

As of Thursday evening, last week, a dark web portal selling the stolen NEM funds was showing zero balance, Tokyo-based security firm L Plus confirmed. This particular dark web website was initially set up on February 7 by an operator offering to exchange the stolen NEM into other cryptocurrencies.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the January 26th heist, some of the stolen NEM was transferred to a third-party digital wallet unrelated to the heist, the cybersecurity firm revealed in its analysis. As reported previously in mid-March, hackers had already laundered 40% of the 500 million tokens despite being tagged by Singapore-based NEM Foundation at the time.\n\u201cThe decentralised NEM protocol\u2019s flexibility allows transactions to be traced in real-time, which aids exchanges to identify wallets attached to malicious activity,\u201d the non-profit foundation\u00a0said\u00a0in February. \u201cThis helps make stolen XEM tokens effectively unusable, because they cannot be deposited without being flagged by NEM.\u00a0\u201c\nFor reasons unknown, that automated tagging system was disabled last week by the NEM Foundation. The move, according to the Tokyo-based cybersecurity firm, has effectively fast-tracked the laundering swap into other coins in multiple wallets. This, despite the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department reportedly assigning over 100 police officers to look into the theft.\nAs things stand, the money launderers are expected to cash out their coins \u2013 already swapped from NEM to other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin \u2013 in overseas exchanges that do not adhere to stringent know-your-customer (KYC) or ID norms. The stolen NEM now exists in other swapped coins spread across a number of virtual wallets including multiple addresses that each contain several hundred million yen\u2019s worth of bitcoins exchanged from the stolen NEM, the report revealed citing a source close to the investigation.\nMeanwhile, Tokyo-based Coincheck has kept its promise to refund NEM holders impacted by the breach by beginning to distributing reparations in Japanese Yen on March 12.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The vulnerability being exploited is classified as CVE-2013-2618, and is allowing hackers to gain code execution ability on the underlying serves. This way, they\u2019re able to install a customized version of XMRig, a legitimate, open-source Monero mining software.\nResearchers detail that the attackers are able to guarantee maximum uptime through the vulnerability, by checking in on the mining malware every three minutes, in case anyone shuts down the system. To avoid detection, the attackers are instructing XMRig to perform discreetly, by limiting the maximum amount of CPU resources it will take advantage of to mine.\nNotably a patch for the vulnerability has reportedly been available for about five years. Some users may still be unknowingly mining Monero for the hackers, despite being able to easily fix the problem. Trend Micro\u2019s report reads:\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a classic case of reused vulnerabilities, as it exploits a rather outdated security flaw whose patch has been available for nearly five years.\u201d\nThe flaw was initially identified five years ago, in April 2013, in the Weathermap plugin. The open-source plugin is used by ISPs, internet exchanges, Fortune 500 companies, and telecom network to map network activity.\nThe cryptojacking campaign is mainly targeting publicly accessible x86-64 Linux servers throughout the world, with the most affected countries being Japan, Taiwan, China, the United States, and India.\n\nTrend Micro researchers managed to discover two Monero wallets receiving the ill-gotten funds, and noted the campaign netted hackers 320 Monero (roughly $63,000) as of March 21. They noted, however, that this campaign is connected to one that used JenkinsMiner malware on Windows machines, and raked in at least $3 million worth of XMR.\nUsers can protect their machines by simply keeping their systems patched.

The firm\u2019s report reads:\n\u201cData from Cacti should be properly kept internal to the environment. Having this data exposed represents a huge risk in terms of operational security. While this allows systems or network administrators to conveniently monitor their environments, it also does the same for threat actors.\u201d\nNotable cryptojacking victims include Tesla, and Starbucks as its Wi-Fi was found using people\u2019s laptops to mine.

Sheena Shah, a Morgan Stanley market strategist, in a research report cited in CNBC, painted a potentially grim picture for the future of bitcoin, finding similarities in the price performance and volume levels with the tech-laden Nasdaq at the turn of the century. At one of its lowest times, the bursting of the tech bubble saw companies losing between $10 million and $30 million on a quarterly basis.\nFor bitcoin, however, it\u2019s all unfolding in a flash.\n\u00a0\u201cBitcoin price weakness has similarities to the Nasdaq in 2000, just occuring at around 15 times the speed,\u201d said Shah.\nFor instance, Shah looked to market rallies, where both the Nasdaq and bitcoin advanced between 250% and 280% during their peaks foreshadowing declines. There were similar trends in trading volume between the index and the BTC price.\nThe following is an illustration from the Morgan Stanley report that was subsequently Tweeted by a WSJ reporter. While the time periods are different, with the Nasdaq\u2019s plight unfolding over nearly a decade through 2002 and bitcoin\u2019s activity reflecting a year, the chart appears to prove a pattern. If it\u2019s a harbinger of things to come, the BTC price has not yet reached a floor.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rise and fall looks just like dot-com\u2019s boom and bust\u2026kind of. https://t.co/K0WtbwlsIH pic.twitter.com/S7KwymWfTx\n\u2014 Steven Russolillo (@srussolillo) March 19, 2018\n\nNot so fast, other says, pointing to cracks in the analysis \u2013\n\nIn the pantheon of #ChartCrimes this is hilariously bad analysis\u2026 https://t.co/EwtbShbDPs\n\u2014 James von Simson (@JvonSimson) March 19, 2018\n\nBitcoin Bear Markets\nThe Morgan Stanley strategist, meanwhile, pointed to four bear markets that bitcoin has endured since its debut in 2009, each of which lasted for an average of five months. During those\u00a0pullbacks,\u00a0the\u00a0price\u00a0has dropped anywhere from approximately 30% to more than 90% at its worst.\nThe most recent declines have seen the bitcoin price tumble some 70% from its highs of nearly $20,000 at year-end 2017 to less than $7,300 in recent days. And if history repeats itself, the current bear market could have another couple of months to go.\nThat places the average decline in the bitcoin price at between 45% and 50% compared to an average 44% drop in the Nasdaq throughout its five bear markets during the tech boom, Shah said.\nIn addition to price, the Morgan Stanley strategist also compared trading volume, where there were similarities but also some divergences between bitcoin and the Nasdaq.\n\u201cThe follow-up rally for both bitcoin and the Nasdaq always saw falling trading volumes. Rising trade volumes are thus not an indication of more investor activity but instead a rush to get out,\u201d noted Shah.\nAs for the differences in trading volume, Shah concludes they could be \u201cinteresting.\u201d\nIn December 2017, they released a report on \u201cBitcoin Decrypted.\u201d In the report, they highlighted the risks associated with bitcoin investing, ranging from a lack of deposit insurance to the absence of regulation.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

This is bad for everyone because the technology won\u2019t stop\u200a\u2014\u200ait will simply move overseas and we will miss out on the opportunity to cultivate the benefits in the U.S.\u201d\n\u201cFor us, the chilling effect can be shown by the difficulty of determining with certainty when a token is not a security. Because we seek to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, we simply cannot take the risk that a token is later found to be a security,\u201d Coinbase concluded.\nIndeed, as CCN has reported, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken an increasingly hard line against token sales and has acknowledged that it is investigating dozens of ICO operators for potential violations of securities laws. Agency officials have said that the current regulatory framework is sufficient for determining whether an ICO is a security, but it has not provided startups with guidance on how to determine on which side of that classification their token sales fall.\nMoreover, the Treasury Department has suggested that ICO operators may be subject to certain regulations governing financial institutions, such as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). This broad interpretation of federal law could require ICO issuers to register as money service businesses (MSB) \u2014 a requirement with which few startups are likely equipped to comply.\nHowever, as witnesses \u2014 and several lawmakers \u2014 warned during last week\u2019s House subcommittee meeting on cryptocurrencies and ICOs, this uncertain regulatory climate will not kill the burgeoning industry, which has taken root across the globe.\nRather, it will continue to lead\u00a0many blockchain startups to relocate offshore and bar US residents from contributing to their crowdsales \u2014 leaving the US on the sidelines as innovation proceeds elsewhere.", "category": "ICO News"}

The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions to other officers and executive departments and agencies of the United States Government.\u201d\nIt is unclear what steps the Treasury Department \u2014 the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in particular \u2014 will take to prevent US residents and entities from engaging with the Petro, but the breadth of this order should give cryptocurrency users pause. Indeed, the IEEPA gives the executive branch the authority to not only regulate and prohibit not only transactions in foreign exchange but also the import and export of currencies and securities.\nGiven that Venezuela has reportedly accepted both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) payments for its tokens, it\u2019s not difficult to imagine a hostile regulator using this incident as an opportunity to crack down on cryptocurrency usage. Investing in Bitcoin, for instance, increases the Bitcoin price, indirectly aiding the Maduro regime to the extent to which it is holding BTC.\nMoreover, since the Petro reportedly runs on the NEM blockchain (which, of course, does not require an endorsement from the blockchain\u2019s creators), could trading NEM tokens (XEM) or listing XEM trading pairs on an exchange be considered aiding Venezuela, since these actions add liquidity to the market?\nSuch discussions are currently pure speculation, and \u2014 given the careful stance with which other regulatory agencies have approached cryptocurrency \u2014 these fears will hopefully prove to be unfounded.\nHowever, as CCN reported, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said in the past that the agency is looking \u201cvery carefully\u201d at Bitcoin and wants to prevent it from being used in connection with illicit activities. To this end, he has expressed his desire that cryptocurrency wallets should be regulated like banks, likely referring to third-party custodial wallets but perhaps betraying an ignorance about the fundamentals of cryptocurrency technology.", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

The project has complied with the official verdict by ceasing the token sale, and investors have been told their cryptocurrency will be returned.\nThe project was proposing to use investor funds for development of their app, with token holders promised equity shares in return. It was this feature that alerted the regulatory authority, who have classed the token as a security. The body\u2019s official statement described the ICO has an \u201cunlicensed regulatory activity\u201d, with collective investment schemes required to register and comply with official regulations. Whilst the SFC has in the past issued warnings to companies, today\u2019s news marks the first intervention to shut down an ICO in Hong Kong.\nBlack Cell Technology are developing a mobile-based food marketplace named Krops, which they believe will simplify business both for farmers and shoppers. It\u2019s unclear how the project will proceed, however, with regulatory bodies clamping down on ICO\u2019s. Previously projects launching via initial coin offerings have had to restrict access to investors from countries hostile to the business model. The US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) has in particular been clamping down on ICO\u2019s with detailed investigations underway. Some projects have received subpoenas, and those just entering ICO stage are keen to stay out of potential investigation. China has been even stronger, however, issuing a blanket ban on all ICOs within the country.\nWhilst the development in Hong Kong has taken some by surprise, the action by Hong Kong\u2019s SFC has not come out of the blue. Last month the regulatory body issued a warning to cryptocurrency trading platforms to not involve themselves with tokens that could be perceived as securities. The body has been steadily developing its approach, indicating potential action as far back as September of last year when a statement was\u00a0issued\u00a0that some cryptocurrency platforms held features that could class them as securities.\nBlack Cell was likely particularly targeted because their token specifically referenced a return for token holders. It was a move that clearly marked the token as a potential security. Other projects have been more ambiguous in their approach however, and avoided direct regulatory intervention. But with authorities clarifying their approach towards ICOs, it remains to be seen for how long that freedom will continue.", "category": "ICO News"}

The Reserve Bank of India, its central bank, has not put the hammer down on trader accounts, but Indian banks have taken a two-pronged approach that\u2019s denting trading activity, including closing bitcoin exchange accounts and limiting cryptocurrency transactions among locals.\nDehli-based bitcoin exchange Coinsecure has suffered through some of the worst of it, with CEO Mohit Kalra telling Economic Times the trading platform\u2019s volumes are off from between BTC 300-400 daily at year-end to a range of just BTC 30-40 today.\nThe writing was seemingly on the wall, as the government\u2019s Income Tax Department at year-end 2017 did a sweep of nearly a dozen bitcoin exchanges, searching for customers who traded cryptocurrencies. Tax officials discovered and alerted some 100,000 residents who were responsible for high-volume trades, as per the Economic Times.\nThe involvement of tax authorities has been exacerbated by the action of public- and private-sector financial institutions that have moved to freeze the accounts of bitcoin exchanges. The banks include \u2013\n\nState Bank of India\nHDFC Bank\nKotak Mahindra Bank\nCitibank\nICCI Bank\n\nMeanwhile, customers are similarly facing restrictions, with banks having banned credit, debit and prepaid card transactions including bitcoin and altcoins. The steps are more severe than the action taken in the United States, where a handful of top banks prohibited bitcoin transactions with credit cards.\nBut if curbing bitcoin trading is the intention, this move by banks and the tone of regulators may backfire, as investors instead shift to using cash for bitcoin transactions. This would complicate the process of tracking transactions to support know-your-customer and anti-money laundering protocols.\nA Run on Bitcoin Exchanges?\nBlockchain and cryptocurrency industry trade group representatives in India consider the latest actions by banks as blatant \u201coverreach,\u201d without any instruction from regulators, saying: \u201cWithout any clear mandate either from the RBI or other regulators, asking us to close down our (exchange) accounts while refusing to give in writing what the reason is just disruptive to our business.\u201d\nMeanwhile, this has led to confusion and angst among investors. Bitcoin exchanges are having to manage an influx of user complaints on their trading platforms amid traders not being able to access funds for days or more. It\u2019s a function of the banks freezing the accounts of these exchanges, which has tied the latter\u2019s hands for issuing withdrawals.\nIn the interim, BTCXIndia\u00a0and ETHEX India have both closed their operations until there is greater clarity on the regulatory front.\u00a0Shaktikanta Das, an Indian Finance Ministry official, doesn\u2019t believe cryptocurrencies can be reined in and instead wants to issue a blanket ban, similar to the approach taken by China.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

Chief executive of the ADCA Nicholas Giuretto commented that the results demonstrated a growing demand for virtual currencies, adding that \u201cThese results demonstrate that Australians are enthusiastically participating in the market for digital currencies,\u201d.\nWhilst the virtual currency economy may be booming, women are seemingly not taking part. The study made no speculation on why female investors are so under-represented, however the result is consistent with a recent poll conducted online. 99.bitcoins.com found that less than 8 percent of global cryptocurrency investors are women, even less than in Australia specifically.\nThe results mark a startling divide, however, efforts have been made to change this. Earlier this month campaigners seized an opportunity provided by International Women\u2019s Day to launch the first annual Bitcoin Women\u2019s Day. The event received heavy backing, with sponsorship coming from\u00a0BitPay, The\u00a0Digital Currency Council,\u00a0The Bitcoin Foundation, TatianaCoin, ChangeTip, The Chamber of Digital Currency, and many others leaders in the Bitcoin community. The organizer of the event Sarah Boone Martin saw it as a fantastic opportunity, both to celebrate the fantastic women in the cryptocurrency industry and to raise awareness of virtual currencies. She gave journalists some insight regarding the cryptocurrency gender divide:\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing gendered about digital currency. There just aren\u2019t many people in the ecosystem. Bitcoin Women\u2019s Day is a chance to talk to more people \u2013 men and women, lawyers, bankers, tech and finance pros \u2013 about this rapidly growing industry.\u201d\nWith events such as Bitcoin Women\u2019s Day proving a huge success, with many taking up the Twitter hash #BitcoinWomensDay to voice their support, we may see more women entering the virtual currency space. Further studies such as the ADCA\u2019s will discover how the the demographic changes in coming years, with many participants driving for a more inclusive and balanced digital currency space.", "category": "Bitcoin Research"}

This isn\u2019t like a chat ban, though. It\u2019s a law. They have to send some guys after you if you decide to ignore the law, and of course, in this editorial, I don\u2019t mean to suggest that you should. It\u2019s clearly a bad idea to tempt the federal government.\nYet, it does present us the rare opportunity to discuss the ultimate power of cryptocurrency over the traditional fiat system. While I personally have no stake in Venezuela, and thus no particular reason to trade in the Petro, aside from potential speculation which I\u2019m willing to forego in the interest of being off the radar of the government, it seems evident to me that anyone who does wish to trade in it will have no problem doing so. The beautiful and most basic nature of cryptocurrency is that it is semi-anonymous.\nAdding in technologies like Monero, it becomes easier and easier to transact in truly private ways where the governments of the world will have one hell of a time interfering with whatever it is you want to do.\nThe \u2018Ban\u2019\nOf course, the new power we\u2019re given through the miracle of cryptocurrencies requires us to be quite responsible. The point here is that one little government ban isn\u2019t enough to actually stop an activity, not where cryptocurrencies are involved. The truly dedicated can send all the money they want today without any boundaries on it. They can even buy all the Petro they want \u2014 if they for some reason want it.\nThe role that cryptocurrencies play in international disputes like that between the US and Venezuela is still being defined. If cryptocurrencies create an obvious way around the banking blockade, it seems evident that some activities with cryptocurrencies will inevitably be made illegal. It seems even inevitable that there may even be attempts to ban cryptocurrencies. Again, such moves can\u2019t actually rid the earth of the new paradigm. Instead, the more they\u2019re banned and attacked, the higher their value will go. Risk breeds reward.\nFor better or worse, the nature of cryptocurrencies is to enable value to flow, regardless of extraneous borders or other issues. While issues like this bring to light the more controversial aspects of cryptocurrency, the fact remains: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies liberate transactions from government interference. While there is still plenty the government can do, the choice remains with the citizen as to whether they\u2019re actually going to send and receive value or not, and this was not the case before the advent of cryptos. When banks and money services were the only options, it was trivial for governments to stop the flow of money to areas they had decided to punish.\nYour Call\nNow, in the days of Bitcoin, it\u2019s actually the citizens who have to decide whether money will go somewhere or not. Arbitrary decisions by leaders, well-intentioned or otherwise, now only play a role of determining the type of punishment a person might receive. The decision as to whether money will flow certain places is in the hands of the people with the money rather than the people with the guns. While this is Bitcoin keeping its promise of \u201cbe your own bank\u201d in action, one wonders what would happen if Bitcoin were used in some full-scale flouting of federal authority.\nAlthough Bitcoin and other borderless cryptocurrencies are constantly under some form of attack or another, there are pain points, such as exchanges and bank accounts of users, which are always vulnerable. It would seem, then, that the practical usefulness of Bitcoin as a form of protest or facilitation thereof only goes so far.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The story began on Nov. 2017, when Rashid reported a flaw to Ledger CTO, Nicolas Bacca, which could allow attackers to steal funds from wallet users.\nRashid had observed that the microcontroller employed in the wallet was not secure. While it allowed the use of buttons and displays to input data, it was connected as a proxy to the Secure Element (SE). The latter contained private keys which meant that a hacker could trick the SE in different ways. Here\u2019s how: retailers and resellers could change microcontroller\u2019s firmware which, now compromised, could verify its \u2018identity\u2019 to the SE. He further explained that the attacker could control the user interface and use their malicious code to set randomness to zero and add a recovery seed of their own choice.\u00a0Rashid chose the word \u2018abandon\u2019 to prove his point in an uploaded video.\u00a0Now that the attacker had the mnemonic phrase, they could get the private keys easily.\n\nhttps://saleemrashid.com/assets/ledger-exploit-73ac411c441ba7fdea0d567237ca7f7b1e0e91fa8a2b2230eae5fc1dc90a3611.mp4\nAfter Rashid sent the research to Ledger, he saw that the flaw wasn\u2019t taken seriously by the team. However, they did publish a firmware update on Mar. 6, which was heavily criticized by Rashid. He posted his opinions on Twitter, since he believed that the team should either have posted it as a critical update or disguised it so that hackers didn\u2019t get time to use this trick.\n\nAs one of the security researchers, I urge to update now. This article doesn't make it clear enough how dangerous this issue can be.\nPotential issues include compromised recovery seed generation or private key extraction. https://t.co/Z2WGFZnFAA\n\u2014 Saleem Rashid (@spudowiar) March 6, 2018\n\nPanic spread among users, who took to Reddit to discuss their next move.\u00a0Eric Larchev\u00eaque, Ledger\u2019s CEO, replied to one such\u00a0post saying it was \u201ca massive FUD\u201d, and that Rashid was trying to bring attention to himself, when the problem was clearly not high-priority. \u201cSaleem got visibly upset when we didn\u2019t communicate as \u201ccritical security update\u201d and decided to share his opinion on the subject,\u201d wrote\u00a0Larchev\u00eaque.\nOn Mar. 20, Ledger published another update that explained three problems discovered by bounty program researchers:\u00a0Timoth\u00e9e Isnard,\u00a0Saleem Rashid\u00a0and\u00a0Sergei Volokitin. Interestingly, Rashid denied this statement because signing Ledger\u2019s Bounty Program Agreement would disallow him for publishing a technical report, which he clearly did on the very same day. As for the new updates, Rashid explained that he wasn\u2019t allowed to receive the \u2018release candidate\u2019 by the company, but he believed that the new fixes were not completely free from hacker attacks.\n\u201cIs it truly possible to use a combination of timing and \u201cdifficult to compress\u201d firmware to achieve security in this model?\u201d, wrote Rashid.

The advisory council will comprise of members of both the private and public sector, including Rivera.\nIt will also include the government\u2019s chief innovation officer (CIO) Luis Arocho, its commissioner of Financial Institutions George Joyner, and a number of blockchain industry entrepreneurs who recently moved to Puerto Rico.\nEl Nuevo Dia, citing sources close to the agency, reports the advisory will unofficially serve as a \u201cfilter\u201d to distinguish legitimate blockchain projects that help solve the island\u2019s problems, from projects that don\u2019t hold any value.\nThis, as recently \u201cblockchain\u201d has become a buzzword companies take advantage of. As covered by CCN, Long Island Iced Tea\u2019s shares surged 300% after it rebranded to Long Blockchain.\nThe news outlet\u2019s source stated:\n\u201c[Blockchain] is becoming a \u2018catchphrase\u2019 in the same way that many companies were previously mentioning \u201ccloud\u201d solutions. The government is very careful about which projects to support.\u201d\nRivera further revealed that the government, through the Blockchain Advisory Council, will develop the best possible regulations and legal framework to further support blockchain businesses. As a US commonwealth, the island offers entrepreneurs the same protections given by the US federal government.\nThese entrepreneurs flocked to Puerto Rico after the country\u2019s infrastructure was decimated by Hurricane Maria back in September, at about the same time most cryptocurrencies saw their value skyrocket. The island\u2019s government has offered entrepreneurs attractive tax incentives, in a bid to boost its depressed economy.\nOne of these incentives can be found within the Internal Revenue Code, and is called Act 22. It reportedly allows non-residents to not pay taxes on long-term capital gains. Speaking to CNBC, Laboy stated:\n\u201cBefore the natural disaster, the hurricane, we were already targeting Puerto Rico to become a world leader \u2014 not only a regional leader, but a world leader \u2014 in export services and technology. That was part of the vision that Gov. (Ricardo) Rossello has for Puerto Rico.\u201d\nOne of the first entrepreneurs to move to the island was Tether co-founder Brock Pierce, who together with other businessmen are creating what\u2019s been dubbed a \u201ccrypto utopia\u201d in the region.\nAs covered by CCN, research recently found Tether itself may have a banking relationship with Puerto Rico-based Noble Bank.

Foreign firms are now allowed to apply for licenses to operate within China, competing against local service providers.\nFreedom For Foreign Firms\nIn China, homegrown companies have complete dominance over the internet and finance industries. Alibaba\u2019s AliPay is said to have nearly 70 percent of the payment market share, while Tencent\u2019s Tencent Pay is responsible for the remaining 30 percent. Ever since the launch of AliPay and the emergence of Tencent Pay, the two conglomerates have retained control over the local payment market.\nHowever, overseas firms will soon be able to operate within China, serving users that are already accustomed to local payment applications. Hypothetically, US-based Square, a payment app developed by a team led by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, and KakaoPay, a South Korean payment app developed by KakaoTalk developers Kakao, could operate in China if they register with the PBoC and obtain licenses.\n\u201cThe domestic market is quite saturated with very strong domestic players, and it is relatively hard for foreign companies to get a piece of the pie. But there is a chance for them to compete in the cross-border payment market,\u201d Iris Pang, a Hong Kong-based economist at ING Groep NV told Bloomberg.\nThe decision of the PBoC and the Chinese government to enable foreign firms to operate in its payment market came after the appointment of the new PBoC head Yi Gang, an American-educated economist well known for his pro-market philosophy.\nEarlier this month, WSJ reported that senior officials in the Chinese government stated that the PBoC intends to provide foreign firms with an opportunity to target the local financial sector. The WSJ report noted that the Chinese government has been planning to bring in foreign companies to its insurance and payment market, to free up the two industries.\n\u201cLiu and Yi have a shared understanding of the need for financial market reforms and liberalization, coupled with more effective regulation,\u201d Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor and former China head for the International Monetary Fund, told the WSJ at the time.\nWhat This Means For Crypto\nOn March 19, according to a South Korean media outlet TokenPost, new Chinese central bank head Yi Gang stated that \u201cbitcoin is a currency that provides freedom to anyone that uses it,\u201d and emphasized that the cryptocurrency is transparent.\nThe optimistic viewpoint towards bitcoin from Yi was somewhat expected by analysts, given his pro-market philosophy and his plans to liberalize the Chinese financial industry. Potentially, the appointment of Yi and the re-election of President Xi Jinping could lead to the regulation of cryptocurrencies and legalization of trading.\nWei Chun, a local analyst, stated:\n\u201cIn summary, the Chinese government have shown a positive attitude towards blockchain technology despite its enforcement on cryptocurrency and mining operations. China wants to control cryptocurrency, and China will get control. The repeated enforcements by the regulators were meant to protect its citizens from the financial risk of cryptocurrencies and limit capital outflow.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

Using now-defunct Pets.com to explain his point, he said:\n\u201cIf you had a portfolio of IPOs \u2014 one was Pets.com and one was Amazon.com \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter what the rest were. You made a great return.\u201d\nMorehead\u2019s words came in a letter sent to investors. It noted that in case bitcoin flops like Pets.com \u2013 which filed for bankruptcy in 2000 \u2013 did, then they will still \u201cprobably do very well.\u201d Using Pantera\u2019s ICO Fund as an example, he pointed out that it would still be positive for them after the Fund, which is made up of 25 ICOs, went down to \u201csingle-digit number of blockchains,\u201d and saw 90 percent of the ICOs go to zero.\nPer the letter, Pantera\u00b4s ICO Fund lost about 25 percent of its value last year, but is still up more than 200 percent since it was created. The hedge fund\u2019s Long-Term ICO Fund is up 5.9 percent, and its Digital Asset Fund is down 16.8 percent. Pantera\u2019s Bitcoin Fund has fallen 26.9 percent this year, but since its inception is up 16,000 percent.\nAccording to the hedge fund\u2019s CEO, bitcoin is the \u201cmiracle whip of finance.\u201d In his letter he advised investors to have 1 or 2 percent of their portfolio invested in blockchain technology. He reasoned:\n\u201cI am not certain that blockchain will return 20,000% again. However, the odds are high enough that when you sum the probabilistic weighted outcomes the expected value is the most asymmetric trade I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\nMorehead also revealed he is bullish on ICOs, as he expects their boom to be \u201cvery much like the 1990s IPO boom,\u201d but much bigger. ICOs have recently been under pressure, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently issued \u201cdozens\u201d of subpoenas.\nAmazon\u2019s example\nMorehead further pointed to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019 strategy with his company. Amazon was a majority investor behind Pets.com. Although the company eventually filed for bankruptcy, Bezos still created \u201can insane amount of wealth.\u201d\nThis, because he \u201cunderstood how disruptive the internet precools that preceded bitcoin would be.\u201d Bezos\u2019 investment strategy was to put his money in more than one dot-com company, to make sure he had exposure to the ultimate winners, Morehead added.\nAmazon\u2019s shares are now up over 4,000 percent since Pets.com went bankrupt, and Bezos is one of the richest people on earth as he\u2019s worth over $130 billion.

The ICO ban has been in place since February though it\u2019s just now coming to surface.\nFacebook, Google and Snapchat jockey for position in the ad market, so it\u2019s not shocking that they\u2019re all in this together.\u00a0New\u2019s of Snapchat\u2019s ban comes in the wake of similar measures by both Facebook and Google.

Wieck covered the industry, the history of blockchain and talked about IBM\u2019s Hyperledger project and how to tackle the challenges of digitization such as food-chain supply safety and digital identity. \nIBM enters Blockchain \u00a0\nIBM Blockchain General Manager Marie Wieck\nIBM started working on a blockchain project about 3 or 4 years ago by forming a unit solely dedicated to the technology with more than 1,500 employees. Wieck noted that \u201cWe can\u2019t get enough people with skills in Blockchain\u201d to fill all positions. She indicated that the industry is hot and needs talent. \u201cDespite all the benefits,\u201d she continued, \u201cblockchain is very hyped and still very misunderstood.\u201d\nHowever, despite being hyped and misunderstood, Wieck went on to say that \u201con a lighter note, my view is you know you have arrived in a technology when there are Dilbert cartoons about [blockchain]. You have now passed the point of the hype cycle and [blockchain] is now in the common lexicon.\u201d A rather interesting note is that most people focus on blockchain\u2019s initial entry point and use case, Bitcoin. They associate anything blockchain with Bitcoin and that is not right. There is so much more to blockchain than Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\nIn Development: IBM\u2019s Hyperledger \nIBM entered into the blockchain world with the question: Is blockchain the next generation of transactions systems?\n\u201cWhat we have concluded from that,\u201d Wieck explained, \u201cis that, no, it\u2019s really an answer to digitization and the process of digitization.\u201d She continued that, \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand the history of what blockchain is and what it isn\u2019t.\u201d She indicated that Blockchain has its origins in digital transformation and disruption. Wieck emphasized that \u201cBlockchain is the answer to the 2008 financial and mortgage crisis. It gets at how you would create the same kind of model that you have in anonymous real-world trading but in a digital world.\u201d\nIn other words, how can you have \u201ccash\u201d transactions on the internet? How can you reconstruct the market experience?\nThe real-world experience is that you go to a market and find a book, you know its value and you know the value of your money. You talk to the seller and come to terms, agree on the fair price, establish a value proposition, and then make the exchange. You did not need to divulge your identity, nor did the seller to make the transaction happen. The question is: How do you do that in the digital world? Today, you cannot do that anonymously because there is a mechanism that identifies you, your credit card, your wallet, etc. This is very true if there are cross-border transactions as there are more actors and agencies that will need to take part in your transaction. This is where blockchain comes in and eliminates the middleman.\nHyperledger Addresses 3 Challenges\nIBM has looked at 3 major problems with using Ethereum as a base for its blockchain:\n\nProof-of-work (PoW): via mining is a high energy consuming process where 40% of the spend on blockchain was on mining in 2017. \u201cthere are other ways of solving the double spend problem without mining. We didn\u2019t like that aspect of consuming a lot of resources without getting a lot for it, Wieck said.\u201d\nPermissions: \u201cA lot of IBM\u2019s clients want to know who they are doing business with and there are ways to provide privacy and confidentiality without being anonymous. The notion of having permissions and trust-anchoring of who you are working with, we believe, actually enhances the value of blockchains.\u201d\nLicensing Model: \u201cIBM wants to use open source, it must be there for a new technology platform like this,\u201d stated Wieck. This is very important due to the collaborative nature of Blockchains.\n\nA year and a half ago IBM approached Linux to work on creating the Hyperledger project. There are now more than 200 participants engaged and it is the largest and fastest growing of all the projects in the Linux Foundation and is seeing a lot of traction in other places.\u00a0\u00a0\nFood Chain Supply Safety \nWalmart has partnered with IBM to build a map of the food supply chain to be able to track produce to promote safety in case of food-borne illness outbreaks. When outbreaks happen, it takes weeks to trace it back to the source. By using blockchain in completely connected supply system, it took only two seconds to trace the origin of the outbreak. For it to happen this fast, competitors will need to cooperate and share logistics information. Despite this need for industry-wide collaboration, IBM has been able to decrease the amount of time it takes to trace back the origin of outbreaks down to days rather than weeks without the blockchain technology in place.\nDigital ID \u2013 How do you know it\u2019s you in the blockchain?\nWieck posed the question: \u201cHow can you replicate going into a bank and producing an ID to transact digitally?\u201d She pointed out, \u201cIf you think about it, by showing a driver\u2019s license you are providing more information than you want to: address, date of birth, etc.\u201d\nIBM is working with Canadian SecureKey, which has a network of all of the major banks, the Government of Canada, and Rogers Communications to be able to verify digital identity. SecureKey is a triple-blind system that gives you ownership of your identity. If someone needs access to your identity to confirm a transaction, they will request only this specific information from you to transact. For example, you go to a bar, the bouncer will need to verify your age and showing a driver\u2019s license gives away more information than needed. By using this blockchain, without providing more information than needed, your age would be confirmed. So, for other transactions, you would be able to provide only the information needed to transact and not more. Essentially, you take control of your own identity. Wieck drew a bigger picture by saying, \u201cImagine that you can control your own credit report and remove a third-party credit reporter that is vulnerable to hacks? It\u2019s a much, much better system to keep your identity safe.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Business"}

It\u2019s also made it harder for smaller companies to IPO in the current economic atmosphere of long-term\u00a0bullishness and constant inflation.\nThis is why the U.S. House of Representatives passed the \u201cRegulation A+ Improvement Act\u201d which allows for a 50% increase in the cap under which companies can do a securities offering while still being governed under RegA+.\nWhat is RegA+?\nRegA+ is a regulation passed under the JOBS Act\u00a0which allows for a more streamlined process than the traditional IPO and allows non-accredited investors to invest. In addition to allowing medium-sized businesses to raise money more easily, RegA+ allows for retail investor participation: a hallmark of cryptocurrencies. It also allows for broader marketing to investors, something which has been and continues to be utilized by ICOs.\nDespite its limited scope, RegA+ has been well utilized with companies raising over $600 million since October using the regulation. This trend has not been ignored by the crypto markets either.\nThe Reg A+ ICOs:\nThe trend of Reg A+ securities offerings is only expected to expand upon the passage of this new regulation. The following ICO\u2019s have already used Reg A+ for their offerings.\n\nGab ICO:\u00a0An ad-free social network for creators who believe in free speech, individual liberty, and the free flow of information online\nRideCoin ICO: A decentralized ride-sharing marketplace built on the blockchain.\nWeDemand ICO \u2013 Allows fans to bid on concerts with smart contracts and tools to track live events\n\nAll of the aforementioned ICO\u2019s are featured on a site called StartEngine\u00a0which now advertises the ability to \u201cLaunch an ICO\u201d. Start Engine\u2019s founder said last month in a post on HACKERNOON that Reg A+ is \u201cthe future of ICOs\u201d, especially considering regulation crowdfunding limit of $1.07 million per year.\nStill Regulated\nDespite the fact that RegA+ reduces the regulations on securities offerings and makes it easier for ICO\u2019s to occur in the U.S. this is not a replacement for the unregulated ICO market of early 2017. Here\u2019s why:\n\nSEC approved exchanges must be used exclusively. This is a bit of a hindrance, and as far as crypto goes\u00a0tZERO\u00a0is the only high profile exchange which would qualify\nReg A+ requires Anti Money Laundering checks for all investors, which increases overhead for ICOs\nReg A+ requires \u201cOffering Circulars\u201d which are quite a bit more detailed than the traditional white paper\n\nThere are also two types of Reg A+ offerings, Tier 1 and Tier 2. In a Tier 2 offering companies must undergo an audit upfront and annually and post financial performance information biannually. The alternative is a Tier 1 Reg A+ which is limited to $20 million but dramatically reduces regulatory requirements.\nSEC regulation still has a long way to go before it is viable for ICOs and these changes are helping to pave the way. I have no doubt that at least some ICOs will embrace these regulations going forward.", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

The market continues to evolve rapidly, however, and this initial assessment could change if crypto-assets were to become significantly more widely used or interconnected with the core of the regulated financial system.\u201d\nPreviously, up until this week, several analysts noted that the upcoming G20 meetup has contributed to the decline in the value of cryptocurrencies, as investors anticipated the G20 financial watchdog FSB to crackdown on cryptocurrencies and issue stricter regulations. Investors expected major economies to come together to regulate the global cryptocurrency market with harsher policies.\nHowever, governments have decided to accommodate existing regulations on the global cryptocurrency market, which are already strict in regions like the US and Japan, and follow the regulatory roadmap of leading cryptocurrency markets to facilitate the rapidly growing demand for the emerging asset class.\nIt is highly unlikely that the G20 meetup was the sole factor behind the recent price surge of bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market. But, the cryptocurrency market was in need of an optimistic and positive development to secure an upward trend again, after being in a slump for over a week.\nConsequently, the valuation of the cryptocurrency market recovered beyond $310 billion, subsequent to falling below $280 billion, and is eyeing to initiate a short-term rally.\nIn previous reports, CCN emphasized that the January correction would require several months to recover because many investors were hurt by the decline in the price of cryptocurrencies. In 2017, the cryptocurrency market was considered the path for short-term profits. In early 2018, investors have stated to view the market differently, and speculators or weak hands have left the market.\n2018 saw significantly developments in bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies along with emerging blockchain technologies. Yet, the price has not represented the magnitude of developments that have happened in the space, most likely because speculators and weak hands were not interested in the technology, but rather in short-term profits.\nShort-Term\nIn the short-term, given the continuous increase in the dominance index of bitcoin, it is highly likely that bitcoin will maintain its dominance over the market in a volatile period like this. Bitcoin\u2019s dominance index is already at 44 percent, and has been increasing since February, as more investors have started to eye bitcoin as a safe investment over other cryptocurrencies.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

For example, a 50 quad-bit computer equals 1.125 quadrillion classical bits.\nQuantum computing is the next level of computers and they carry with them the power to totally supplant work that classical computers do, namely crack uncrackable encryption within seconds, and compromise Bitcoin address and API keys. For a quantum computer, this will be a small feat.\nCurrently, the chances of someone being able to hack a private key to a bitcoin wallet that might contain a substantial amount of currency is very small: 0.024% chance with a classical computer. To put that in perspective, that percentage of a successful hack is equal to winning the lottery multiple times in a row. Practically impossible, but not improbable.\nWhile quantum computing is not there yet, companies such as Google and IBM are working on projects and state that we are only 5 years away from so-called \u201cquantum supremacy,\u201d where quantum computers surpass what a classical computer could ever imagine being able to do. Referencing the 50-quadbit computer mentioned previously, IBM is currently working on one of this size.\nPlay a Smart Defense \nTo combat this threat that quantum computers pose, some blockchain developers such as NEO are working on quantum-safe blockchains and cryptocurrencies. According to the NEO white paper:\nNeoQS (Quantum Safe) is a lattice-based cryptographic mechanism. At present, quantum computers do not have the ability to quickly solve the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and the Closest Vector Problem (CVP), which is considered to be the most reliable algorithm for resisting quantum computers.\nAccording to Open Quantum Safe, an open-source protocol for prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography:\nSeveral mathematical techniques have been proposed for constructing quantum-safe cryptosystems, including:\n\n\nhash functions\n\n\nerror correcting codes\n\n\nlattices (including the learning with errors (LWE) and related problems)\n\n\nmultivariate equations\n\n\nsupersingular elliptic curve isogenies\n\n\nPrepare For the Long-Term\nMoving forward, it will be imperative to develop quantum-resistant cryptography before quantum computers start to appear. However, as with any new technology, it is always rare and expensive and only the rich can afford the technology. After some time, it starts to trickle down to into society as prices decrease and more people can afford it. Once it becomes affordable, this is the time to be concerned about hacking into cryptocurrencies. However, the timeline is still long according to a respondent to a poll put forth by Futurism:\nIn the 2020s, we will have quantum computers that are significantly better than super computers today, but they most likely won\u2019t be in mass use by governments and companies until the 2030s. Eventually toward the end of the 2030s and early 2040s they\u2019ll shrink down to a size and cost viable for consumer use. Before that point even with the exponential growth of technology I don\u2019t think that it would be cost efficient enough for the average consumer to replace regular computing with quantum computing.\nWhile quantum-safe technology will be important in 20 years, most cryptocurrencies are under no threat yet. But to the futurist, it would be wise to keep the threat of quantum computers in the back of your mind.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The problem was that segwit wasn\u2019t being adopted worldwide as the transition which had to be made by mining companies and corporate businesses (exchanges for example), was a manual activation. So businesses waited until segwit was proven to be secure and only then activation would happen. There is another version that says activation didn\u2019t happen sooner as the overall fees will decrease for mining companies. How is segwit adoption looking over the last 30 days, at the moment of writing? Take your own conclusions!\n\nhttp://segwit.party/charts/#\n(it already more than doubled. Couldn\u2019t resist, sorry)\n(b) The Lightning Network (LN): we can finally say it\u2019s going live! It already has more than 1500 nodes connected in the testnet and people have already been making real transactions despite the warnings (I love these folk. They\u2019re the real deal). A recent announcement came this week stating it will finally move onto the first mainnet.\n\nhttps://explorer.acinq.co/#/\n\u00a0Now Lightning Labs, the company behind the original development, is moving to the production environment, meaning, you will have the option to use off-chain payment channels to do transactions. You can now setup a lighting node, which will re-route payments to other nodes, and get paid to do that. Or you can simply start using it as a final consumer, who wishes to send money to another peer, or maybe make a payment to a business; you can count on escrow payments to be immediately implemented and used. Fees paid will decrease exponentially as miners will only register and validate final balances from the off-chain channels onto the blockchain.\nI can\u2019t wait for this to go Live, I\u2019m so excited!\n\nBut if you think great technology developments stop on bitcoin and the blockchain, oh boy you\u2019re in for a treat!\nOther projects have surfaced and past ICOs are starting to bear some of the fruits. I will mention the four I consider top contenders to become massively adopted (I may be massively wrong, please beware):\n1. Ethereum: Obviously the most famous project just after bitcoin and for a good reason. Not only is moving into PoS (although PoW will remain working) with its latest close-to-be Casper upgrade which is already being tested. Congratulations to the team, it seems they\u2019re managing to pull out a rabbit out of a hat, this is, moving from one consensus algorithm to another isn\u2019t an easy accomplishment, I guarantee you. Not only it\u2019s improving its own network but due to the many projects around the ethereum protocol, it\u2019s gaining loads of momentum. Let\u2019s discuss some of them:\n\nThe Raiden Network: it works more or less as the ethereum\u2019s LN. In a recent update they\u2019ve shown how it is possible to do machine-to-machine payments and implement smart-contracts in IoT devices, so that people can interact with them. You really need to watch this talk (if you\u2019re not patient start on minute 10:30). Loredana, one of the main developers, did a great job when presenting the latest developments.\n\n\nModum: this team is building an inter-connected supply-chain for big businesses. They\u2019re working closely with the Pharma industry and already starting to show progress, as Thilo told me when we spoke over email. I would advise you to pay close attention to this project, as it can become one of the best if correctly implemented.\n\n\nOmiseGo: another project with the touch of Vitalik, the founder of Ethereum. OmiseGo are developing a decentralized off-chain payment solution, to make it easy for people to exchange value over the ethereum network. It seems to be going quite well, as the team is making loads of new announcements and have a quite interesting roadmap laid out for this year.\n\n\nGolem: although it has its own network to monetize computer resources of people connected to it, it uses the ethereum network for payments. They\u2019ve released Brass in the testnet, a CGI super-computer rendering tool that allows designers and artists to quickly render their projects, for a considerably cheaper price than regular rendering farms. Absolutely epic in my opinion, how economic incentives are correctly applied.\n\n2. Cardano: I know they\u2019re still building their own protocol, but honestly the way they\u2019re doing it already deserves its due credit. The idea is to have a fully decentralized protocol that works with PoS and it is easily scalable, even though it integrates smart-contracts. The IOHK team behind Cardano and Ethereum Classic is quite extensive in both knowledge and people. Look at the first Cardano wallet released last year, the Daedalos, which is quite robust and hasn\u2019t had any major problems. The academic approach by the team is brilliant as they participate in many conferences and peer-review their papers. I personally love this project, especially due to the amount of activity and commits on github. Compare it to 90% of any other project and see the difference for yourself.\nCardano wallet vs IOTA wallet on github\n3. IOTA/Circle: Im mentioning both IOTA and Circle, as although I originally was more pro-IOTA, due to the recent issues with the wallet and the lack of clear response by the development team \u2013 and also because of that Microsoft partnership ordeal a few months ago \u2013 I started looking at alternative DAG projects, like Circle. Both have the same principal, just different teams and approaches. IOTA has been a great project to pave the way for other DAG currencies to appear, like Circle. David is the smart mind behind the first attempt to implement a feeless network. Hopefully both will improve along time and even each other, as we see so many of these projects using cool ideas, concepts and features from different projects and sources. The openness of the field is driving innovation forward in a much faster pace. I hope I\u2019m wrong about IOTA and the problems get fixed. They\u2019re still in a testnet, guided by the founding team, so I\u2019m expecting to be put to my place in just a few months as more improvements, nodes and people join the network.\n4. Monero: the first widely adopted privacy coin is still very much at play and recent announcements make me believe the technology and team are moving development forward. This makes sense for businesses, governments and people who do not wish to have all their transaction history available for the world to see. I understand privacy and I do not associate it to crimes or shady deeds. People are entitled to doing whatever they want with their money, as long as it is legal right?\n\u2013on a side note, I did not mention many amazing projects like Neo, Stellar, Upfiring, Status, Santiment, WingsDAO, Monaco or ClearPoll for example\u2013\nUSABILITY\nThe most important feature of cryptocurrency will be usability, this is, when it becomes as easy to use as bank cards nowadays, things will definitely flip.\n\nThis is how I see it going (danger: pure speculation ahead).\n\nRegulators and Governments attack cryptocurrency and ICOs as it is an unlawful way of raising money;\nIt fails and cryptocurrency bounces back, as it has happened during the last couple of years;\nBanks, Financial institutions and Payments companies attack cryptocurrency as a whole, estimating it is only used for criminal purposes and money laundry;\nPeople and companies ignore all the warnings as fees become much lower than traditional banking ones;\nPrevious ICOs will continue to grow and expand its networks to the point traditional companies cannot compete with the new utility and securities business models;\nGovernments and regulators start to adapt and produce new regulation that fosters cryptocurrency growth, as a new way to attract businesses and talent;\nPeople start to trust cryptocurrencies more and more, as more projects start to yield results. The losses on bad investments and scams will lower because:\n\n(a) People become smarter and won\u2019t fall for basic schemes that easily (learning-by-doing).\n(b) Regulators adapt new regulation to meet criteria that takes into account the digital and transparent nature of many cryptocurrency projects (Government protection).\nAgain, am I being too naive?\nMaybe, but this is truly what I think will happen eventually. Price fluctuations will become a normal thing, as people start to understand the value of everything is whatever the market determines, including money. When people say governments won\u2019t have the power to control the currency, they forget even governments can (and should) create their own cryptocurrencies with specific monetary incentives. Want people in your country to use the currency you issue? Easy, just make sure it has a purpose and utility, meaning, people shouldn\u2019t be obliged to use the currency governments decide to accept, but rather the currency that is most convenient to them. Also, if governments want to have more say and control over the total supply of cryptocurrency, let\u2019s say bitcoin, they can go to the markets and buy bitcoin. As simple as that.\nAs a last piece of advice I would like to leave you with some great people you can follow. Check their content on youtube, medium, steemit and twitter as it will help you becoming a better investor and understand in-depth how this technology works. The only way to ease your mind when prices drop is by having accumulated knowledge on how this technology works, how it will change the world and how there\u2019s no stopping it.\nPlease do check the below sources and I hope they help you as much as they\u2019ve helped me:\nHacked,\nAndreas Antonopoulos,\nIvan on Tech,\nBoximing,\nCoin Mastery,\nData Dash,\nRichard Hart,\nJimmy Song,\nVitalik Buterin,\nCharles Hoskinson,\nDan Larimar,\nDavid Sonstebo,\nCrypto Investor,\nAlessio Rastani,\nThey call me Dan.\nLet me know what you think in the comments section.\n\u00a0", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

The facility is reportedly being built across three locations in London, Suffolk and Surrey with Bladetec claiming the company is the first bitcoin mine in Europe to be funded by investment in a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulated firm via capital raising partner Envestry.\nDetails on its website reveal that Bladetec is seeking a minimum investment of \u00a35,000 per investor with shares sold at \u00a31.00/share par value with funds used to purchase mining hardware and pay for electricity, site and admin costs. The company will be 100% shareholder owned, Bladetec added.\nThe company contends it has secured deals with wind farm for cheaper electricity, which will constitute the majority of the costs. The electricity will be used to power some 1000 ASIC mining rigs, to be purchased by TBBMC, running at 43 terahashes per second, according to information from Envestry.\n\u201cThe combined processing power of this mine will be on the Peta-hash scale, which will make it a significant global mine,\u201d says a summary of the investor pitch. \u201cProceeds from the mine will be securely stored in off-line wallets and safety-deposit boxes.\u201d\n\u201cWe are entirely focused on maximising shareholder returns and so, understanding the relatively volatile nature of Bitcoins, we have allowed for four different growth scenarios with up to 45% capital growth per annum,\u201d explains Declan Kennedy, CFO and one of three admins who will manage TBBMC.\nThe company intends to exit bitcoin mining within 2-3 years with shareholders\u2019 returns earned from the sale of mined bitcoins and the mining equipment in pound sterling.

According to a press release, the move will grant the company an increase in ownership by 8.6 percent.\nBitt is a company that first appeared in 2015 as a mobile payment platform designed specifically for the Caribbean market, beginning with Barbados. Since then, the company has been developing its digital commerce system on top of distributed ledger technology, or blockchains. Medici Ventures already has a significant stake in the company, with the original investment of $4 million being made as early as 2016. Shortly prior to Overstock\u2019s investment in that year, Bitt had launched its own digital version of the Barbadian Dollar on the bitcoin blockchain.\nThe President of Medici Ventures, Jonathan Johnson, said,\n\u201cBitt has created a blockchain-based payments ecosystem that is useful for every day transactions. It has positioned itself as a clear leader in applying blockchain technology to solve real-world problems.\u201d\nIn February 2018, Bitt announced a partnership with the Caribbean island, Montserrat, to introduce its digital payments platform in the region. Given that smaller economies, such as the ones present in the Caribbean, often struggle with financial institutions and liquidity, it is easy to see how unified blockchain-based alternatives, such as the one proposed by Bitt, will be able to change that. The company is looking to enable the purchase of goods and services using the Barbados digitized currency, that can be accessed and transferred in supported areas through a mobile app.\nThe CEO of Bitt, Rawdon Adams, was also optimistic about the investment. His statement in the press release included,\n\u201cBitt is in a unique position to provide the solutions to boost both financial inclusion and overall economic performance through its blockchain-based software. That\u2019s already being recognized by regional governments overseeing economies characterized by large informal sectors, persistently high rates of poverty and expensive traditional financial services. I thank Medici Ventures for their support of our mission.\u201d\nOverstock\u2019s Medici Ventures division, founded in 2014, has been making a significant investment in applications and companies demonstrating the use of blockchain technology. Another subsidiary of the company, tZero, had also announced the launch of an initial coin offering (ICO) in November 2017. At the time, Medici\u2019s portfolio of investments included nine different companies, all associated in some way or the other with blockchain technology.", "category": "Blockchain News"}

According to Sky News, Twitter\u2019s ad ban would go into effect in two weeks.\nThe microblogging platform will reportedly block ads from initial coin offerings (ICOs), cryptocurrency wallets, and exchanges. Notably the ban will have limited exceptions, potentially meaning verified, legitimate businesses will still be able to advertise their products and services.\nThe move is notable as Twitter is a popular platform in the cryptocurrency sphere. It may have been predictable, however, as earlier this month the company\u2019s CEO Jack Dorsey revealed he was taking care of scammers who, as covered by CCN, are even hijacking verified accounts to trick users.\nTwitter\u2019s cryptocurrency ad ban may, as such, be part of its crackdown on scammers. Social media giant Facebook made a similar move earlier this year, banning cryptocurrency-related ads to protect its over 2.7 billion users. At the time, the company revealed the policy was intentionally broad as it attempted to \u201cwork to better detect deceptive and misleading advertising practices.\u201d\nGoogle is also set to ban online advertisements promoting cryptocurrency-related content in June 2018, as part of its newly updated financial services policy. It\u2019s set to curb other financial products including contracts for difference (CFDs). When the ban was revealed, Google\u2019s director of sustainable ads Scott Spencer explained the move was a precautionary measure. He said:\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a crystal ball to know where the future is going to go with cryptocurrencies, but we\u2019ve seen enough consumer harm or potential for consumer harm that it\u2019s an area that we want to approach with extreme caution.\u2019\nBoth Facebook and Google also banned binary options trading ads. As Sky News notes, these bans follow the release of figures from Action Fraud, that showed victims\u2019 losses in Britain surged by 400,000% in six years.\nThese platforms banned cryptocurrencies at a time in which the market has been enduring a bearish period. Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, has fallen from a mid-December all-time high of over $19,000 to a $5,900 low in February. At press time, bitcoin is trading at $8,339, according to CCN\u2019s price index.\nFurther pushing the market down is the seemingly endless bubble talk. As recently covered, Visa\u2019s chief financial officer (CFO), Vasant Prabhu, argued that we know the market is in a bubble as unsophisticated investors are investing in it and have \u201cno idea what they are doing.\u201d", "category": "FinTech News"}

At the time, Foxbit claimed it would be back online by March 14, but now warned the platform will be offline until March 26.\nThrough a YouTube livestream, the cryptocurrency exchange\u2019s COO Guto Schiavon and CEO Jo\u00e3o Canhada revealed users will be able to withdraw their funs during Foxbit\u2019s downtime. Withdrawals, according to the exchange\u2019s executives, will be processed manually.\nThis means that to request a withdrawal, users will have to fill in a form. Per Schiavon, Foxbit will have 40 employees working on customer support to guarantee all requested withdrawals are processed. The exchange will only allow users to withdraw their entire balances.\nTo make it up to its customers, the exchange will process withdrawals without charging fees. During the YouTube livestream, several users questioned Foxbit\u2019s health, to which its founders replied (roughly translated):\n\u201cThe platform will come back, but it is not in our interest to hold any user\u2019s balance, be it in real or bitcoin. It is a solvent company and there is no problem if all users make withdrawals.\u201d\nThey further stated that the \u201cpower of exchanges isn\u2019t shown by their lack of failure, but by their ability to come back.\u201d Foxbit\u2019s executives added that they\u2019d improve their communication in the future, and that users shouldn\u2019t use the exchange as a wallet. Instead, they advised them to store funds in a wallet so they\u2019ll be in charge of their own money.\nOther cryptocurrency exchanges using Blinktrade, a company that allows exchanges to develop their own platforms without hiring a developer, have also been down as the company is reportedly dealing with an error in its database.\nPakistani exchange Urdubit used Facebook to reveal it won\u2019t be back until March 18 because of Blinktrade, while Vietnamese exchange VBTC claimed it could be back online anywhere between today and March 18.\nNotably, according to local publication Portal do Bitcoin, bitcoin trading volume fell by about 50% in Brazil soon after its biggest exchange went down. During Foxbit\u2019s incident, users seemingly prefer to wait it out instead of flocking to the exchange\u2019s competitors.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

Even at their recent peak, their combined global market value was less than 1% of global GDP,\u201d he added. \u201cIn comparison, just prior to the global financial crisis (in 2008), the notional value of credit default swaps was 100% of global GDP.\u201d\nThe FSB review determined that, for now, the relatively small usage of cryptocurrencies as fiat money substitutes and the \u201cvery limited use for real economy and financial transactions\u201d means\u00a0limited links to the wider financial system for cryptocurrencies.\nThis initial assessment could change, Carney added, if cryptocurrencies permeated into the core of the regulated financial system or if they gained usage as payment instruments.\nThe remarks come at a time when crypto-regulation is widely reported as a hot topic discussion among G20 members during this week\u2019s meeting. \u00a0The G20, an international forum of governments and central bank governors from the world\u2019s top 20 economies.

As BitMEX noted, this surge in deposits correlated with the cryptocurrency market\u2019s dramatic upswell, and Tether\u2019s market cap grew by 215 percent during the same period.\nSource: BitMEX Research\nMoreover, cash deposits as a percentage of total assets grew to 85.8 percent from 72.7 percent during the quarter, indicating a growth in full-reserve banking. Full-reserve banking is rare, and there are only two such banks in Puerto Rico that fall under the IFE category.\nOf these two banks, only one \u2014 the San Juan-based Noble Bank \u2014 has verified relationships with cryptocurrency-related firms. In Fact, Noble Bank\u2019s founder and CEO, John Betts, has a previous professional relationship with Tether co-founder Brock Pierce, stemming from a failed bid to take over now-defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.\nBitMEX Research had previously fingered Noble as a potential banking partner for Tether, and it said that the newly-released aggregate financial system data added further support to this thesis. However, the assets could just as easily belong to other cryptocurrency-related firms, as Puerto Rico has begun to attract these businesses en masse.\nIf Noble is serving as Tether\u2019s primary reserve bank, it would be a significant development, as it would indicate that \u2014 at the very least \u2014 Tether is not a Ponzi scheme and that its assets are backed by USD.\nAs CCN has reported, Tether\u2019s solvency has been a hotly-contested topic in industry circles over the past several months. Tether\u2019s USDT token serves as a proxy for USD on many cryptocurrency exchanges, and critics have alleged that the token is not fully-backed by USD and is consequently being used to prop up the Bitcoin price.\nTether had contracted with an accounting firm to audit the firm\u2019s balance sheet, but the two parties \u201cdissolved\u201d their relationship before the report could be completed and published.\nThe US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) reportedly subpoenaed Tether \u2014 along with cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex \u2014 in December, but it is not clear what the regulatory agency discovered as a result of the probe.\nTether did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a Noble spokesperson declined to answer CCN\u2019s inquiry, stating: \u201cAs a matter of company policy, Noble doesn\u2019t disclose client information.\u201d", "category": "Altcoin News"}

Escobar even included a photocopy of Satoshi\u2019s passport as proof of the meeting.\nSource: Escobar Inc.\nHowever, Escobar later discovered that Satoshi was actually an agent of the US government, after which he realized that Bitcoin was a CIA plot.\nHe writes:\n\u201cI am the first person in the world\u2026to publicly come out and claim that Bitcoin was created by the American Government, and I am not going to be the last person to say this. The world is going to wake up. The world is going to see that this was created by them.

To illustrate his point, Lee and his team have developed a robust database on bitcoin comprised of charts and graphs that identify trends for the top digital coin over both the short- and long-term durations.\nFor instance, Fundstrat\u2019s bitcoin misery index, a contrarian barometer that debuted earlier this month, is at 18, its lowest point since 2011, which is a bullish sign for the future price of bitcoin.\nFundstrat\u2019s Lee isn\u2019t deterred by bitcoin\u2019s 70% decline, saying instead that bitcoin remains in a \u201cbull market phase.\u201d In fact, it\u2019s not the first time the bitcoin price has shed this much or more. Similar losses occurred over stretches in 2011 and again in 2013 and could actually be a harbinger of profits.\nLee points to a previous 70% sell-off in the BTC price over a four-month stretch in 2013 that preceded what the firm describes as a \u201cmonster rally\u201d in which bitcoin generated\u00a0what appears to be unparalleled\u00a0returns. Here\u2019s the chart, courtesy of Fundstrat (as Forbes points out, Fundstrat\u2019s \u201clogarithmic scale\u201d isn\u2019t as dramatic as the typical linear chart)\nFundstrat\nThere\u2019s more. Bitcoin has also exhibited similar trading patterns of the past in that its downside volatility has been greater than its upside performance. For instance, the BTC price has advanced 37% in the latest three-month stretch compared to an eight-year average of 38%. Fundstrat explains:\n\u201cThe lack of up days is not particularly unusual for\u00a0Bitcoin. But it is down from 2017, when this figure peaked at 56%.\u201d\nFundstrat\u2019s bullish forecast extends to other leading cryptocurrencies, including ETH in 2018, which in addition to BTC will benefit from \u201clarger and more established blockchains growing in dominance\u201d this year, according to the Fundstrat report. Meanwhile, Forbes suggests there will be a separation of the wheat from the chaff, so to speak, with the leading coins capturing most of the investments.\nHistory Repeats Itself?\nWhile the Fundstrat charts clearly reveal patterns, there\u2019s no way to tell for sure if history will repeat itself and the bitcoin\u00a0price will rally once again to achieve $91,000 by 2020. As Forbes points out, regulators have the ability to interrupt any fundamental trading in the bitcoin price. Having said that, they also conclude that bitcoin is currently in an \u201coversold\u201d state.", "category": "Bitcoin Price News"}

They are, however, yet to materialize despite the likes of China and Singapore successfully trialing digitized versions of their fiat currency on a blockchain. The first notable release of a state cryptocurrency, for better or worse, is the controversial oil-backed Petro, proclaimed as a national cryptocurrency that will evade international sanctions by Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro.\nThe Mastercard executive\u2019s revelatory remarks follow those of president and CEO Ajay Banga who dismissed all non-government mandated cryptocurrency as \u201cjunk\u201d last year. \u201cIf the government creates digital currency, we will find a way to be in the game.

One of these issues, presumably referring to initial coin offerings (ICOs) is the lack of certainty when it comes to regulations in place, for both token issuers and investors. Since cryptocurrencies are global, he argued, global coordination is needed to tackle regulations in the crypto sphere.\nAnother issue is risk. The OECD director mentioned money laundering, which he says needs to be addressed through coordination. He also noted that investor and consumer protection needs to be addressed, as fraudsters keep tricking potential investors, and projects often don\u2019t disclose basic information.\nPer his words, the OECD is specifically interested in market integrity, and in cases in which cryptocurrency exchanges get hacked, as the organization sees investor protection principles as one of its key instruments, according to Medcraft, who previously served as the chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).\nMedcraft underlined the need for governments and regulators to come together to discuss the best possible way to protect consumers in this area.\nBlockchain technology is \u201cthe next revolution\u201d\nCriptomoedas F\u00e1cil then asked Medcraft about his thoughts on blockchain technology. He replied that he sees the technology as \u201cthe next revolution,\u201d and that combining what we have with distributed ledgers makes for exciting possibilities. He said:\n\u201cWell, I think that distributed ledger is the next revolution (\u2026) If you\u2019ll actually enable this intermediation in many parts of the value chain, which should result from my point of view in cheaper, faster, better products for consumers and investors. That transparency, I think that the peer-to-peer that is enabled through distributed ledger will help financial inclusion.\u201d\nThe biggest beneficiaries of this type of technology, he said, will be governments, financial services providers, and global supply chains. Governments, for example, will be able to use blockchain technology to improve voting systems, and review their services.\nIn his answers, the OECD director noted blockchain technology has three key advantages: it allows for the secure exchange of value, the secure of exchange of data, and for better cybersecurity. The latter, he believes, isn\u2019t yet being properly explored. Per his words, the technology will \u201creshape\u201d the world\u2019s economy.\nThe conversation then drifted on to the use of private and public blockchains. Per Medcraft, in the future we\u2019ll have a combination of both, as when we\u2019re exchanging value we need to have traceability in order to hinder money laundering and terrorism financing. He noted, however, that traceability doesn\u2019t mean anonymity needs to be sacrificed, it means that \u201cthere\u2019s got to be an ability for law enforcement to identify the flow of money.\u201d\nUsing bitcoin as an example, he stated:\n\u201cWith bitcoin, for example, you can trace at the moment IP addresses, you can trace computer to computer, but what you\u2019ve got to do is trace form person to person, and that\u2019s the missing point of the moment with Bitcoin. I can trace it to your computer, and I can\u2019t actually trace it to you.\u201d\nWhen asked about Venezuela\u2019s oil-backed cryptocurrency, the Petro (PTR), Medcraft said he believes that, in the future, we\u2019ll have different types of cryptocurrencies. Among them are cryptocurrencies issued by central banks, which he says will reshape banking, and asset-backed payment tokens like the Petro.\nThese asset-backed tokens could be promising depending on where the custody of the reserves is. Ideally, it would be possible to convert the token to the asset backing it if needed. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are, according to him, backed by nothing and only based on a \u201csupply and demand algorithm,\u201d that may not be popular in the future.\nThe scalability problem\nCriptomoedas Facil\u2019s interviewer then went on to ask Medcraft about his thoughts on bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network. Per the OECD director, bitcoin brought the world the ability to transfer money in real time, but these transactions need to be done quickly and at virtually no cost, he added. According to him, bitcoin has scalability problems and consumes vast amounts of energy. One of potentially many solutions could be the Lightning Network, but bitcoin\u2019s \u201clack of transparency problems\u201d aren\u2019t solved with its implementation.\nInstead, he noted, Stellar may be the way to go. He claimed the cryptocurrency\u2019s technology could even surpass Visa\u2019s transactions per second, which had him closely look at it. Medcraft concluded, however, that it\u2019s exciting to see how cryptocurrency entrepreneurs develop solutions to solve the scalability problems, and claimed that what happened in the crypto space so far is amazing.\nHat tip to\u00a0Cassio Gusson and Cristhian Raphael from Criptomoedas F\u00e1cil.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The Intercept is reporting classified documents leaked by Snowden prove that the US National Security Agency (NSA) in fact was keeping tabs on bitcoin users globally, as evidenced by a report that\u2019s surfaced from March 2013. The timing is curious, with the ink barely dry on an executive order signed by President Trump to ban Americans from transacting with Venezuela\u2019s Petro coin.\nIn true\u00a0spy\u00a0agency style, the report is filled with code names and numbers as well as the cataloging and cross-referencing of data that ultimately helped them to \u201ctrack down the senders and receivers of bitcoins,\u201d top secret excerpts reveal. The NSA called its bitcoin spying project Oakstar, and the initial focus of the mission was counterterrorism-focused.\nIt doesn\u2019t appear that the NSA was randomly targeting people. They at least appear to have been monitoring groups that were using the level of anonymity allowed by bitcoin transactions for clandestine purposes, such as money laundering activities. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what a top-secret NSA entry looks like, here\u2019s a glimpse:\n\u201c[NSA agent] is hoping to use the access for their mission of looking at organized crime and cyber targets that utilize online e-currency services to move and launder money. These illicit finance networks provide user access to international monetary systems while providing a high degree of anoymity.\u201d\nHere\u2019s how it went down. The NSA was seemingly able to use the sophisticated\u00a0tools available to the US spy agency to collect and\u00a0analyze internet\u00a0data, capabilities that were bolstered by let\u2019s call it a super software program that protected the identity of users.\nBitcoin was one of three areas of activity that were being watched, in addition to Liberty Reserve, which has since\u00a0been shuttered amid money laundering\u00a0with cryptocurrencies, and one other. Even though bitcoin isn\u2019t the most anonymous cryptocurrency out there, it was the \u201cNo. 1 priority\u201d of the NSA.\nNetwork Access\nWhile the blockchain is a public ledger, the NSA didn\u2019t stop there. They apparently gained access to user computer systems, collecting information such as passwords, user sessions and a media access control address. They also seem to have captured personal info such as billing details and IP addresses. The agency was set on uncovering the connection between what they called \u201cbitcoin targets\u201d and the data they had.\nAs for the timing of the reveal, it could just be a coincidence. But regardless, the more that the government tries to get its grips on the blockchain movement, the more it seems to only embolden the cryptocurrency community to distance themselves further from the centralized financial system.", "category": "Bitcoin Crime"}
{"title": "Switzerland Settles as the World\u2019s Leading ICO Hub", "url": "https://www.ccn.com/switzerland-settles-as-the-worlds-leading-ico-hub/", "birthday": "2018-03-21T06:32:26+00:00", "date": "2018-03-21 06:32:26", "year": 2018, "month": 3, "day": 21, "content": "The following opinion piece is an early analysis of the legal aspects of the recently released ICO guidelines.\nThe Swiss are smart. \u00a0They have always been with money. In last 20 years, Switzerland has progressively lost its appeal as the former secret banking centre of the world. \u00a0This has dramatically changed the landscape among Swiss professionals \u2013 mainly lawyers and fiduciaries \u2013 which have progressively lost clients and businesses and had to look for new areas of opportunities. And now they have been the fastest and smartest in jumping at this new business opportunity. \u00a0And this time the potential is really immense for the Confederation.\nWorld Premiere for ICO\u00b4s\nICO`s, ITO\u00b4s or TGE\u00b4s, call it whatever you want, are the future of fundraising. \u00a0And the Swiss financial authority (FINMA) on 16th of February 2018, was the first regulator to officially issue fairly detailed ICO guidelines to help clarify if and how the current Swiss laws will apply to ICO\u00b4s. As a lawyer, I must say that I am positively impressed. Due to the recent crescendo of hysteria, critics and plainly alarming statements on the part of Central Bankers, regulators and financial prominent people vs. ICO\u00b4s, Bitcoin & Co, I was fearing that a regulatory nightmare scenario would have rapidly ensued for the sector. Luckily, the Swiss move sets an important precedent for regulators worldwide. \u00a0Either follow the Swiss smart lead and improve their regulatory framework \u2013 thereby making compliance for ICO\u00b4s less burdensome and therefore a more attractive environment for ICO issuers, or go the other way and make it more burdensome than the Swiss and consequently shot yourself in the foot just like they did in NY with the infamous BitLicense. Then, say forever goodbye to the most promising business sector of the future.\nI am optimistic that the countries that will soon follow the Swiss move \u2013 likely Gibraltar and possibly Canada, London, Singapore, Estonia and even Spain \u2013 will do the smart thing and start a race to the top rather than to the bottom, therefore making it easier for start-ups to go the ICO route. This is also a huge opportunity for Europe if the EU regulators will be smart enough to improve the path set by the Swiss. \u00a0If not, if they decide to do like the Americans, then I am sure that London will grab the opportunity to do the smart thing and attract very good business. After all, London is ideally positioned \u2013 after Brexit \u2013 to offer EU start-ups some generous incentives (also on the taxation side) to move there and steal precious business from the EU and its sclerotic bureaucracy. The Brits have all the infrastructure (just like the Swiss) to become one of the leading ICO hubs in the world. It would be a pity to lose this opportunity.\nThe FINMA guidelines\nNow, without getting too much into the legalities of it, let\u2019s see in simple terms what the Swiss new guidelines say. I will keep it short to five main points.\n\n First of all there is no need for new regulations. Existing regulations are sufficient to regulate even recent creations such as tokens/coins or cryptocurrencies. This is known by legal practitioners as Analogia legis \u2013 a fundamental principle shared by all civil law jurisdictions \u2013 whereby the interpretation of existing laws can be extended to new cases if they are analogous. Therefore FINMA correctly classifies tokens/coins and cryptocurrencies in very practical terms based on their use and the rights attached to them. Then they decide if and when existing Securities\u00b4 Laws and AML (Anti Money Laundering) Regulations will apply.\n Based on current experience, fundamentally 4 types of tokens/coins have been classified: payment tokens (i.e. cryptocurrencies), utility tokens, asset tokens and hybrid tokens.\n\n(i) payment tokens are not securities \u2013 therefore all the burdensome compliance with securities laws is excluded \u2013 but because they are a means of payment, then AML (Anti Money Laundering) regulations apply;\n(ii) utility tokens are to be looked into more carefully. Generally, they are not to be considered securities if they grant the right to a digital use or to a digital service. \u00a0In addition, the investor must be able to use the token already at the time of the ICO. This means that all the infrastructure of the issuer \u2013 that allows the tokens to be spent \u2013 must be already fully operational at the time of the ICO. However, if the token has even partially the characteristics of an \u201cinvestment\u201d, then it will be treated as a security. Because they are not considered a means of payment, AML does not apply.\n(iii) asset tokens are always considered securities and will fall within the burdensome application of Swiss Securities\u00b4 Laws (i.e. a prospectus is necessary, etc). \u00a0However, because they are not considered a means of payment, AML does not apply.\n(iv) Hybrid tokens will have to be evaluated on a case to case basis.\n\n All the above applies only to tokens which already exist at the time of the ICO. Whichever token will be issued post-ICO is to be considered a security. \u00a0Therefore the procedure known as ICO pre-sale or pre-financing shall be avoided if you do not want to fall within the application of Securities Law.\n FINMA also provides a well-detailed Questionnaire which is to be completed by the ICO issuer to request FINMA\u00b4s opinion on the prospective ICO. \u00a0A fee will be due as well.\n Finally, AML compliance can be easily fulfilled by hiring the services of a Swiss financial intermediary which will ensure compliance with AML laws on behalf of the ICO issuer. \n\nClearly, with the growing flow of ICO\u00b4s, FINMA will provide vital clarifications and interpretation to the guidelines and an interesting framework of practical ICO cases will soon develop, which will be a very useful precedent for practitioners and regulators worldwide.\nAll in all, a positive and balanced approach which no doubt will bring very good business in Switzerland.

Maduro officially launched the pre-sale of the 82.4 million Petro tokens on February 20.\nSpecifically, today\u2019s report points to two key Russians involved as Maduro\u2019s advisers on the Petro, with ties to major Russian banks and billionaires close to the Kremlin. Denis Druzhkov and Fyodor Bogorodsky were reportedly seated in the front row in the presidential palace during the much-publicized launch of the Petro last month. The two Russians were also thanked by the President \u2018for aiding his fight against American \u201cimperialism\u201d\u2019, the report added.\n\u201cOf the two Russians who also signed agreements with the government to help develop the petro one, Denis Druzhkov, CEO of a company called Zeus Trading, was fined $31,000 and barred from trading for three years by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for fraudulent trading in futures\u2019 contracts,\u201d read an excerpt from a separate investigative\u00a0report by the Associated Press. \u201cThe other, Fedor Bogorodskiy, lives in Uruguay and was described by the government as director of a company, Aerotrading, whose website consists of a single home page with no company information.\u201d\n\u201cAccording to an executive at a Russian state bank who deals with cryptocurrencies, senior advisers to the Kremlin have overseen the effort in Venezuela, and President Vladimir Putin signed off on it last year,\u201d the Time report added.\nThe state bank executive reportedly added:\n\u201cPeople close to Putin, they told him this is how to avoid the sanctions. This is how the whole thing started.\u201d\nWhile the Kremlin did not respond to communication from the magazine, Moscow\u2019s Finance Ministry insisted that none of Russia\u2019s financial authorities were involved in developing or launching the Petro. The Venezuelan government did not respond to the magazine for comment either.\nThe revelations come within a day of US President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order banning American citizens and residents within the country from trading or acquiring the cryptocurrency.\nMeanwhile, Maduro congratulated Putin on the latter\u2019s recent re-election victory that confirms Putin\u2019s continuing role as Russia\u2019s President.\n\n\u00a1Gran victoria de Vladimir Putin!

The first physically delivered contract will be launching in April and will be for the delivery of bitcoin.\n\u201cOur mission is to build a bridge between fiat currency and cryptocurrency to drive the stability and sustainability of cryptocurrency,\u201d said Obi Nwosu, CEO of Coinfloor. He said market participants want futures contracts to switch from cash to physical settlement.\nResponding To The Market\nLiquidity providers want a physically delivered futures contract to be able to hedge their exposures across exchanges, Mark Lamb, Coinfloor co-founder, told Reuters during the Futures Industry Association\u2019s annual conference in Boca Raton, Florida.\nA few traditional futures exchanges, such as CME Group Inc. and Cboe Global Markets Inc., offer bitcoin futures that are cash settled, in which the cryptocurrency itself does not change hands.\nLarge investors and proprietary trading firms have noted that the cash-settled process can be easily manipulated, Lamb said. Ill-intentioned players can set the futures prices in their favor by moving the price of the indexes or auctions on spot exchanges that set the futures prices in, he said.\nCoinfloor investors include the closely held Chicago-based proprietary trading firm DRW, which was launched in 2013 and runs the largest U.K.-based cryptocurrency spot exchange in London and another one in Gibraltar.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}
{"title": "What Ban? Chinese Investors Continue to Participate in ICOs with Workarounds", "url": "https://www.ccn.com/what-ban-icos-in-china-are-alive-and-well/", "birthday": "2018-03-21T13:13:55+00:00", "date": "2018-03-21 13:13:55", "year": 2018, "month": 3, "day": 21, "content": "It will take more than a government ban on ICOs to keep issuers away in China.\nBoth investors and issuers in the country have found a way to circumvent the laws that were implemented last year by Chinese regulators, according to a report in local publication Caixin Global.\nDespite the fact\u00a0that ICO demand largely stems from Asia, China in September 2017 infamously cracked down on the market, making token sales illegal and inspiring South Korea to do the same. Meanwhile, Asia is where most of the bitcoin mining has occurred, and investors were keen to often reinvest their profits in ICOs.\nDespite the ban, investors continue to gain access to newly issued tokens, which can be highly speculative in nature, while issuers have been dancing around the ban by domiciling their projects abroad. Another workaround for issuers has been to offer their\u00a0digital tokens for no charge.\nBitcoin Exchanges in Focus\nRegulatory pressure has not abated, and overseas cryptocurrency exchanges boasting some Chinese presence, such as on social media, are currently on the radar of Chinese officials. Someone close to the government agency in China that regulates internet finance risk told Beijing-based Caixin that officials are moving to block the IP addresses of such exchanges.\nRisk management experts say that closing off access to regulated cryptocurrency exchanges is a bad idea, as such access gives regulators a chance to monitor transactions. Without it, they\u2019re in the dark, which is an undesirable outcome.\nICO Workarounds\nThe effectiveness of China\u2019s ICO ban is comparable to that of a parent telling their\u00a0rowdy children to quiet down. The volume may have been turned down a notch or two, but the activity is still happening in veiled attempts, such as airdrops, IMOs and redomiciling.\nCompanies have been able to bypass the ICO ban by orchestrating airdrops in which tokens are distributed for zero cost. Meanwhile, issuers behind the tokens benefit from the marketing prowess that such events provide, as projects gain momentum among community members.\nInitial miner offerings, or IMOs, are another workaround. These deals supposedly give investors the opportunity to back the mining of new coins, but a self-regulatory agency in China warned they have all the features of an ICO.\nFor instance, take the Xunlei IMO. Participants in the IMO lent their\u00a0computer bandwidth in exchange for Lianke coins. The regulator said it qualified as a fundraising event.\nFor all their innovation, ICO issuers are also using the oldest trick in the book. They\u2019re moving their\u00a0corporate headquarters abroad and soliciting Chinese investors by what\u2019s known as \u201cexport for domestic sale,\u201d as the Caixa article points out. In these instances, third-party intermediaries act in proxy of Chinese locals in these ICO projects, many times at a discount. Communication about the projects unfolds on popular messaging apps.\nWhether China will ever loosen its grip on the cryptocurrency market including ICOs remains to be seen. But for now, it appears that the ICO market is alive and well in China.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

While bitcoin has rebounded over the past few days, it has only recovered from its price drop that occurred in mid-March. Two weeks ago, the price of bitcoin peaked at $11,600, and the cryptocurrency is still $2,600 away from reaching its monthly high.\n\nLast month, the price of bitcoin dropped to the $5,000 region and after a speedy recovery to $10,000, it dropped to the $7,000 region. This week, bitcoin price recovered to $9,000, and is moving towards entering the $10,000 region once again. While the market has been extremely volatile, bitcoin has gradually recovered from $5,000 to $7,000, to $9,000, even amidst several minor and major corrections.\nThe strong performance of bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Cardano has led the entire market to regain its losses from earlier this month, as the valuation of the cryptocurrency market increased from $280 billion to $350 billion in merely 48 hours. \nThroughout January to March, bitcoin suffered the third worst correction to date, as the price declined 70 percent from $19,000 to the $5,000 region. Yet, unlike its previous two corrections, bitcoin has managed to gradually rebound from major drops.\nThe large drop in the price of bitcoin was only intensified and exaggerated by negative media coverage, especially from traditional economists and bankers providing baseless price predictions and false information in regards to the regulatory frameworks around the cryptocurrency market.\nAlmost immediately after the global financial watchdog FSB announced at the G20 summit that major governments are planning to sustain existing regulations and no additional regulations or restrictions will be imposed on the global cryptocurrency market, cryptocurrencies started to recover from their losses.\nAlternative Cryptocurrencies Rally\nBitcoin has consistently been the best performing cryptocurrency over the last two weeks. Today, alternative cryptocurrencies rallied, as cryptocurrencies like ICON, better known as South Korea\u2019s Ethereum, increased 60 percent due to various partnerships and airdrops. \nICON (ICX) has been listed by Bithumb, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, as its 10th cryptocurrency, causing the cryptocurrency to increase in value and volume.\nEthereum, which has not performed well for over a week, has also demonstrated a 9 percent rise in price, along with Cardano, Litecoin, Zcash, Nano, OmiseGo, and Aion.\nThe vast majority of casual traders and newcomers are strongly influenced by panic sell-offs and fear of missing out (FOMO). When investors in the public market outside of the cryptocurrency space continue to see the cryptocurrency market and digital currencies within it recover in the range of 5 to 10 percent on a regular basis back to its previous levels, FOMO will drive new investors into the market, allowing short-term rallies to occur.\nFor a real-time bitcoin price chart, click here.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Instead, as has been the status quo for generations, growing demand for limited resources has meant little benefit for the historically troubled country\u2019s ordinary citizens. As demand for the metal continues to soar, cobalt miners have been met with exploitative and illegal industry practices- including wide-spread child labor.\nA pilot program, using blockchain technology, could trace the material from the source through the supply chain to instill much-needed accountability in cobalt production.\nLack of Accountability\nA recent report by Amnesty International and African Research Watch alleges that world leaders in electronics and automobiles are neglecting basic checks to ensure that cobalt is sourced without the use of exploitative practices. Big names including Apple, Samsung, Sony, Volkswagen, and twelve\u00a0 other multinationals are indicted in the report. Mark Dummet, Business and Human Rights Researcher at Amnesty International illustrates the crux of the problem-\n\u201cMillions of people enjoy the benefits of new technologies but rarely ask how they are made. It is high time the big brands took some responsibility for the mining of the raw materials that make their lucrative products.\u201d\nWidespread Abuse\nAccording to the US Geological survey, 66,000 of the 123,000 metric tons of cobalt was mined in the DRC. Conditions in the cobalt mines offer stark contrasts to finely designed, sleek products in which the lustrous, grey metal is integral.\nMiners, with little protective equipment, work exhaustive hours with little pay. They risk injury, long-term health issues, and death in the little-regulated cobalt mines. The report noted 80 miners dying in the underground mines from September 2014 to December 2015, with likely many times more remaining unreported.\nAccording to a 2014 report by UNICEF 40,000 children were estimated to be working the mines in southern parts of DRC, the majority in the cobalt industry. In the Amnesty International report, children reported being forced to work 12 hour days underground for $1-2 a day.\nBlockchain Initiative\nA pilot program has been developed and is aimed to bring accountability to the industry. Though some companies such as Apple and Samsung have already joined a Responsible Cobalt Initiative, accountability is difficult in the DRC where appropriate institutions are lacking or non-existent.\nTaking a cue from the diamond industry, the cobalt industry plans to use blockchain\u2019s distributed ledger to offer some assurances for consumers, though researchers admit it may be difficult given the economic and political realities in the Congo.\n\u201cWe are prototyping, iterating, testing, scaling\u2026. The technology is not the hard part,\u201d explained Sheila Warren, head of Blockchain Policy at the World Economic Forum.\nThe proposal intends to provide every bag of verified, artisanally produced cobalt an immutable digital identity. This allows it to be recorded by various actors along the supply chain, from at-site observers all the way to the smelting facility, and on to the end consumer.\nAs smartphones become ubiquitous and the electric car revolution gears up, it alludes to the possibility of a more connected, open, and cleaner world.

Around 30 jobs are expected to be created locally.\nIn welcoming the cryptocurrency firm to the country, Norway\u2019s Minister of Trade and Industry Torbj\u00f8rn R\u00f8e Isaksen said:\n\u201cI am delighted that the Bitfury Group has chosen to establish their new data center in Norway and Mo I Rana\u2026. This represents a major economic opportunity for Norwegian businesses. The datacenter industry is growing fast and provides Norway with opportunities of economic growth and new jobs.\u201d\nBitfury contends the datacenter will run on a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1.05 or lower, listing it among the world\u2019s most energy efficient mining operations. To fuel its production, Bitfury is purchasing 350 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of 100% hydroelectric renewable energy from a local power supplier.\nNorway\u2019s open embrace of cryptocurrency mining firms is aided by the colder temperatures and access to renewable energy, along with a friendly tax code. These factors will prove favorable to miners at a time when crypto mining is under scrutiny for its energy-intensive appetite.\nFor instance, the state of New York\u2019s public utility regulator recently granted local power suppliers the ability to charge higher tariffs for crypto mining firms in the state.\nNot so in Norway, where the country\u2019s industry minister has a markedly different approach in dealing with crypto companies.\n\u201cIt has been important for us to facilitate the opening of more data centers in Norway,\u201d he added, in quotes reported by Norwegian state-owned publication NRK.\u00a0\u201cWe have green power, so this can create jobs and investments in new technology.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

Certain high-income individuals may also be subject to a 3.8 percent surtax.\nPreviously, trading between cryptocurrencies was likely not a taxable event, since it was considered a \u201clike-kind\u201d exchange (The IRS has not given definitive guidance on this, but this is the position that many tax analysts have taken).\nHowever, due to a provision in last year\u2019s tax overhaul, these like-kind exchanges trigger taxable events for all transactions that occur after Jan. 1, 2018.\nThis could prove hazardous for many cryptocurrency traders, particularly those that deal in high-volatility small cap coins. An investor or trader could realize a taxable event when exchanging Bitcoin for an altcoin, for example, and he would still face that tax liability even if the altcoin stake later becomes worthless.\nLowering the capital gains rate would mitigate that risk \u2014 at least somewhat \u2014 and it would also provide long-term hodlers with the ability to take money off the table without having to put quite so much of it in Uncle Sam\u2019s coffer.", "category": "Bitcoin Politics"}

He didn\u2019t dismiss the possibility that bitcoin could be surpassed by Ethereum or other altcoins that prey on the leading cryptocurrency\u2019s weaknesses, but bitcoin\u2019s strength is in its size.\nBitcoin controls more than 40% of cryptocurrency market cap compared to almost one-fifth for Ethereum, as per Coin Market Cap data cited in CNBC.\nSilver and Gold\nThe PayPal founder and Facebook\u2019s maiden major investor was clear that the direction he sees bitcoin headed in is as a store of value, not payments, the latter of which he characterized as a \u201ccumbersome\u201d application.\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about a new payments system.

Fundstrat Global Advisors\u2019 data science team developed\u00a0a bitcoin mining model that has\u00a0determined\u00a0the\u00a0current price level\u00a0for BTC is below the threshold to profitably create it. The\u00a0Fundstrat report, which was\u00a0obtained by CCN, revealed it\u2019s basically a wash right to mine bitcoin currently.\n\u201cBitcoin currently trades essentially at the break-even cost of mining a bitcoin, currently at $8,038 based on a mining model developed by our data science team,\u201d according to Fundstrat\u2019s Sam Doctor and Ken Xuan.\nIt\u2019s an unusual situation for the cost of mining to supersede that of the asset itself, Fundstrat says, suggesting that the current multiple represents a \u201ctrough\u201d and that now is not the time to sell. Incidentally, today\u2019s BTC multiple is revisiting 2015 levels when it was at a \u201csecular bear market low,\u201d according to Fundstrat. At that time, the bitcoin price was just $176.50.\nFundstrat Model\nThe Fundstrat model is three-pronged, taking into account machine expenses, energy and the cost of overhead such as the cooling systems that prevent computer servers from overheating during the energy-intensive process of mining. The current market dynamics could just be enough to cause the miners to flip the switch, at least for now.\n\u201cIn some cases, the miners may simply turn off the machines until the price comes back a bit. It\u2019s got to be getting to the point that some of them may be losing money,\u201d noted Blockchain Intelligence Group\u2019s Shone Anstey quoted in a CNBC article.\nFundstrat Report\nMiner profits have essentially been slashed by 50%. Adding insult to injury to miners, the price per transaction is also on the decline, all based on data cited by CNBC.\nRisks and Rewards\nWhen times are good, bitcoin mining pays off, with this China\u2019s Bitmain alone have generated between USD 3 billion and USD 4 billion in profits last year. Fortune points out that mining pools tied to Bitmain and BTC.com control more than 40% of bitcoin mining.\nThe hardware to perform bitcoin mining can run you anywhere from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. But once the equipment becomes obsolete, the equipment must be replaced in order to remain competitive with all of the other volunteers who are using their GPUs to solve puzzles to advance the blockchain and earn their reward.\nAnd according to the Fundstrat report, equipment upgrades comprise more than 50% of mining costs. Meanwhile, Fundstrat quantamental\u00a0strategist Sam Doctor based the calculation to arrive at the BTC floor price in part on energy costs of $0.06 per kilowatt hour.\nThere is, however, a glass-half-full scenario surrounding the price dynamics for bitcoin mining, for speculators at least. If bitcoin is anything like its non-correlated precious metal cousins, equalling its cost of production suggests a price bottom is near.\nMarch is historically a weak month for bitcoin, but hold onto your hats.

The group led Robinhood\u2019s last funding round one year ago, valuing the company then at $1.3 billion,\u00a0according to The Wall Street Journal.\nRobinhood chose not to respond to a request for comment.\nInvestor Expectations High\nRobinhood now ranks among the leading 15 private technology firms in the U.S., thanks to investor confidence that it can gain traction in the financial trading market.\nThe company\u2019s three-year-old app has gained 4 million users, representing a doubling in one year. The gain was driven by an offering of free stock trades that beat the fees of discount brokers.\nWhether or not the company can gain enough users to support the cost of premium services, such as \u201cgold\u201d subscriptions starting at $6 per month to trade after hours and borrow capital, remains to be seen. The company earns profits on the interest that it holds in client cash accounts and by selling client trades to market makers.\nRobinhood\u2019s median age user was around 30, which means they have less cash to spend than older clients that big brokerages serve. Robinhood expects its younger investors\u2019 assets to increase with time. Eventually, the company expects to offer additional services to its clients. To date, the company has restrained investing in marketing in order to reduce its overhead.\nInvestors also believe there is an opportunity in the company\u2019s introduction of cryptocurrency trading, trades that are commission free.\nAlso read: Stock brokerage app Robinhood launches cryptocurrency trading in 5 states\nChasing E*Trade Financial Corp.\nRobinhood, at $5.6 billion, is valued at a third of E*Trade Financial Corp., with a market cap of $15 billion.

Once these wallets are removed, we will no longer be able to recover these coins. Users must withdrawal their coins before March 30, 2018, in order to keep them.\u201d\nThe Bittrex team also stated that several cryptocurrencies have broken blockchains that have disabled users from withdrawing their balances.\n\u201cThe coins marked with an asterisk (*) have broken blockchains or wallets that will not allow withdrawals,\u201d said Bittrex, referring to cryptocurrencies like CRYPT.\nOn leading trading platforms, it is difficult for exchanges to sustain a stable order book if a cryptocurrencies does not have enough liquidity and demand from users of the platform. Lack of liquidity leads to price manipulation, which can be initiated with funds as little as $50,000, as shown in the recent study done by cryptocurrency trader Sylvain Ribes.\nBy using a method called slippage\u2013a process of selling $50,000 worth of a particular cryptocurrency on a trading platform to measure its impact on the price\u2013, Ribes evaluated the liquidity of digital assets on major exchanges like OKEx and GDAX. While GDAX had a slippage of less than 1 percent, on OKEx and other cryptocurrency-only exchanges with low market cap or volume cryptocurrencies, each sale of $50,000 led to a 2 to 10 percent drop in the market value of cryptocurrencies.\n\u201cA bit of wash trading and artificial volume inflation is to be expected in a thoroughly unregulated market. What I did not expect was the magnitude of the fraud,\u201d said Ribes. \u201cMany pairs, albeit boasting up to $5 million volumes, would cost you more than 10% in slippage, should you want to liquidate a mere $50k in assets,\u201d he added.\nWash trading and price manipulation is common on major trading platforms with small cryptocurrencies or low-volume cryptocurrency pairs. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently warned investors against pump and dump schemes that are often seen in the cryptocurrency market.\n\u201cFraudsters often try to use the lure of new and emerging technologies to convince potential victims to invest their money in scams.

For US-based cryptocurrency exchanges like Bittrex, it is mandatory to register with the SEC before processing trades involving tokens.\nThroughout next few months, many major exchanges will likely de-list or remove small cryptocurrencies that are prone to pump and dump schemes, and market manipulation.", "category": "ICO News"}

Given the royal family\u2019s demonstrated interest in the asset class and the general willingness to embrace cryptocurrency development, the move is perhaps not too surprising.\nAccording to a press release issued by Bank Frick on February 28, 2018, it will be offering a wide variety of cryptocurrencies on its trading platform effective immediately. The initial set of digital currencies available for purchase will include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash.\nThe target audience of the bank likely comprises of high net worth individuals and institutional investors, or rather, the type of individuals that already have a sizeable amount of funds in various banking instruments.\nFor any cryptocurrency exchange or broker, especially those, security is an important consideration. As is traditional for any cryptocurrency exchange, Bank Frick has stated that it will store all of its customers\u2019 cryptocurrency assets in cold wallets, or rather, on computers air-gapped from the internet for the most part. Other security features, however, were not detailed in the press release.\nThe financial institution in question is already a fully-regulated bank that complies with all know-your-customer related laws at the country and EU level. Thus, it is safe to conclude that the same identification requirements will be carried over for any investor looking to purchase any amount of cryptocurrency from Bank Frick.\nThe bank also confirms regulatory compliance in its statement,\n\u201cAt Bank Frick, cryptocurrency investments are subject to the same strict statutory measures as traditional financial transactions,\u201d and \u201cClients can only invest in cryptocurrencies once they have been fully identified and verified. The verification and identification process also involves checking the origin of the money used to invest in them.\u201d\nEven though Bank Frick is a financial institution that primarily caters to Liechtenstein citizens, it has announced that the platform will be available to any European entity interested in it. The Chief Client Officer, Huber B\u00fcchel, said,\n\u201cOur services are in demand from companies across the whole of Europe. This is because they know that we can offer them reliable support in implementing their business models with cryptocurrencies and blockchains in line with the existing regulatory framework.\u201d\nFurthermore, the bank has announced that it will be accepting foreign currencies in exchange for cryptocurrency assets. At this time, investors can transact in US Dollars, Euros or Swiss Francs.\nBank Frick joins a rather exclusive list of banks willing to not only adopt, but also facilitate the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies.

While trading volumes of most major cryptocurrencies across leading exchanges remain low overall, bitcoin\u2019s daily trading volume has been relatively low, with sell volumes intensifying on exchanges like Bitfinex and Bithumb.\nYesterday, on March 16, CCN reported that although many analysts within the cryptocurrency sector and traditional finance industry unanimously agree on an optimistic long-term price trend for the cryptocurrency sector, the majority are skeptical towards the short-term momentum of bitcoin, given the 70 percent correction it has suffered since January.\nAfter dipping below the $6,000 mark and falling from $19,666 to $5,920 by recording a 70 percent drop in value, the most dominant cryptocurrency in the global market has rebounded to the $7,000 region, and briefly achieved $11,600 last week. \nBut, as demonstrated by a cryptocurrency analyst better known as Wolf of Crypto below, it is important to acknowledge that bitcoin has suffered the third worst crash in its history, behind the 83 percent crash from $259 to $43 in April 2013, and the 87 percent crash from $1,163 to $152 throughout late 2013 and 2014.\n\nSome people are visual learners! Cheers pic.twitter.com/znaGdYi6h2\n\u2014 WolfofCrypto (@bullishgentlemn) March 15, 2018\nBut, as demonstrated by a cryptocurrency analyst better known as Wolf of Crypto below, it is important to acknowledge that bitcoin has suffered the third worst crash in its history, behind the 83 percent crash from $259 to $43 in April 2013, and the 87 percent crash from $1,163 to $152 throughout late 2013 and 2014.\nIf speculators and investors expect 10 to 100-fold returns, it is only logical to also expect 50 to 80 percent decline in value, given that volatility exists going up and down. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market is still at its early stage; not enough retailers have adopted cryptocurrencies as a payment method and not enough projects have shown commercial success to demonstrate their potential to revolutionize trillion-dollar industries.\nIt is difficult for any major cryptocurrency to recover from its recent 70 percent correction because this time, investors in the mainstream and public markets have been damaged by the decline in the price of cryptocurrencies. Previously, cryptocurrencies were considered as an up-and-coming asset class with the potential to be worth many trillions of dollars in the future. \nNow, a small portion of investors that experienced significant losses in the latest correction see the market as a bubble and as a failed opportunity, despite the optimistic comments of some of the finance and technology industries\u2019 largest names, including Peter Thiel and Alan Howard.\nThe mainstream media is contributing to the continuous decline in the value of bitcoin, by offering predictions that can be considered absurd, given the lack of basis for them. For instance, a recent coverage by Bloomberg claimed the price of bitcoin will likely fall to $2,800, without providing evidence or indication of some sort.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

The perpetrator, Matthew McDemott, served as the information technology manager for the department, which overlooks the functioning of the citrus industry in Florida.\nThe FDLE arrested McDermott shortly after the discovery and had him transported to Polk County jail. The cryptocurrency mining operation was discovered after an evaluation of the department\u2019s utility bill amounts. According to the department\u2019s inspector general, the months between October 2017 and January 2018 saw a jump of $825 in electricity costs.\nMining refers to the act of verifying of transactions within a cryptocurrency\u2019s network. The FDLE also attempted to explain McDermott\u2019s motives, stating,\n\u201cA mining pool, or team, is used to solve mathematical equations in an effort to mine the virtual currency and win a reward. The pool combines its resources to help offset costs.\u201d\nGovernment owned computational resources have actually been the target of clandestine cryptocurrency mining operations for a very long time now. Given that computers in some state-owned facilities are quite powerful because of the workload they need to handle, individuals are often tempted to use them for self gain. Just a few days ago, for instance, the Louisiana Attorney General sacked several IT employees after they were found guilty of using government computers to mine bitcoin.\nIn February 2018, a BBC report also revealed that hackers had successfully injected a cryptocurrency mining script into the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office website. The hijacked website would use the processing power of a visitor\u2019s computer to mine cryptocurrencies without the knowledge of the user.\nThe United States is not alone in its battle against unauthorized use of its computers for cryptocurrency mining. According to another BBC report, several Russian nuclear scientists were arrested following the discovery of their plot to mine bitcoin at a top-secret nuclear warhead facility in Sarov, Russia.\nIn most cases, the penalty for using government resources for personal gain is not very severe at all. However, in this instance, Matthew McDermott also used a state purchasing card to obtain additional mining hardware worth $22,000. The money was reportedly used between July and December 2017 to purchase 24 graphic processing units according to the Florida law enforcement agency. Because of the extended nature of his crime, McDermott has been charged with grand theft on top of official misconduct and had his bail set at $5,000.", "category": "Mining"}

However, they said that they had discovered a solution for this problem.\n\u201cPureChain is the only PUF technology that does not require the use of error correction codes that have hindered mass production of other types of PUF,\u201d ICTK Holdings CEO S. Sam Yu said. \u201cAs a result, the applications of PUF range far and wide from blockchain technology to IoT security, user verification and much, much more.\u201d\nThe developers predicted this technology could hasten the introduction and adoption of central bank-governed digital currencies, which would allow nations to digitize their national currencies and capitalize on the efficiency of blockchain-related systems without relinquishing control of the money supply.\n\u201cIt is a realistic blockchain technology that can be applied to CBDC,\u201d said Han Ho-hyeorn, a Kyung Hee University professor and the leader of the PureChain research team.\nUnfortunately, many questions remain about PureChain. Regional media outlets who covered the press conference did not go into detail about the structure of the network\u2019s \u201cledger-free blockchain.\u201d Nor, for that matter, did they explain how the technology avoids the use of PUF error correction codes.\nHowever, if PureChain does prove to be as useful as researchers claim, expect central banks to begin eyeing it as a potential tool to help them transition their countries into cash-free societies.", "category": "Banking"}

Most of these new games involve the integration of game visuals and audio content with a player\u2019s environment in real time. This phenomenon is described as Augmented Reality (AR).\nReal-life Participation\nWorking with the GPS application of the mobile devices, game players are made to complete tasks and quests around their immediate physical environment. These kinds of games have a way of acquiring several associated benefits to participants depending on the game\u2019s primary dynamics. Exploring one\u2019s immediate environment is what a lot of people hardly engage in. To do so based on the motivation of some form of rewards or challenge makes it an interesting and in most cases captivating system of exploration.\nBeing a new kind of technology and still in its innovative stages, AR is finding a lot of different implementation in the gaming industry that mirrors real life processes. Some are set in the ancient existence of several ages ago, while others are set in the present day living or projection of future existence. Beyond the timeline, these setups are also organised to represent specific industries, ranging from politics, to commerce, real estate, culture, e.t.c.\nAR and Blockchain Implementation\nA typical example of AR implementation is the Mossland Reality Reflection which is a location-based Augmented Reality (AR) mobile game that is based on real estate. In Mossland, users identify real properties in the world and add them to the game world. This gives other users the ability to buy and sell real-world properties in the Mossland virtual world. The game utilizes a blockchain-based cryptocurrency to facilitate trades, sales and purchases by users of in-game properties, emulating the real-world property market in the game and giving players a new way to interact with each other.\nTemple Treasure Hunt is another example where Indian mythological characters come up as treasure guardians in a game that uses real map of a location. This geolocational game centres around mystery lovers who play roles of either treasure protectors or treasure hunters.\nVarious AR games abound in today\u2019s gaming ecosystem, but the fascinating element is how blockchain implementation is enabling the transfer of real value across the gaming ecosystem. In one of the examples mentioned above, mimicking the real-life real estate marketplace involves actual trading and other commercial exercises. Being connected across a global network automatically requires a reliable platform where transactions can be secure and transparent.\nValue Extraction in Gaming\nBlockchain in the gaming world enhances the value of tokenization as it offers the flexibility that is needed to connect people across different countries and cultures. Blockchain tokens (for example, Moss coin in the case of Mossland) serves as the universal unit of value transfer which influences the liquidity that is necessary in the gaming marketplace. Be it for purposes of auction or reward, the underlying tokens remain the connecting units that enable the fulfillment of gaming contracts.\nIn order to extract real value from any gaming marketplace, blockchain will always play an important role. These tokens are cryptocurrencies that can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or fiat in order to derive usable value. Apparently, Blockchain and AR are practically causing a total revolution in the way gaming is interpreted. Unlike in the past when gaming was mostly about fun and recreation, several tangible benefits are currently being attached to the experience nowadays.\nBeyond the social values of connecting individuals from different parts of the globe, Blockchain and AR are taking gaming to another level. Education, exploration, research and commercial benefits are just a few of the values that are currently being extracted from within the ecosystem.", "category": "Bitcoin & Blockchain Investments"}

A bitcoin is a claim on nobody \u2013 in contrast to, for instance, sovereign bonds, equities or paper money \u2013 and it does not generate any income stream.\nBitcoin\u2019s demise would have few spillover effects on the \u2018real world,\u2019 since the market for this cryptocurrency is still quite small in size. As a result, we believe that the risks to financial stability stemming from bitcoin are negligible \u2014 at least as of today,\u201d said Hofrichter.\nHowever, as stated many times by respected analysts and bankers like Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, the concept of intrinsic value is flawed, and base value in assets simply does not exist. For instance, stocks, commodities, and fiat currencies also do not have intrinsic value, as their value solely depend on the supply and demand sought out by the free market.\nEmphasizing that multi-billion dollar conglomerates rely on digital trust and thus do not have intrinsic value, Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee explained:\n\u201cIf you ask a baby boomer, \u2018Can you justify the value of anything that\u2019s a digital business?\u2019 they probably don\u2019t accept that Facebook, Google, Netflix, Amazon, Apple, these are the largest companies in the S&P 500 and they\u2019re primarily digital businesses built almost purely on digital trust.\u201d\nThe value of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin derive from their security, decentralized protocol, and the distributed network of nodes, miners, and users that sustain the network. The computing power of the bitcoin network has increased to a point in which no single entity or organization can ever match it, disallowing or eliminating the possibility of double spending, or taking advantage of the system to produce more digital currencies.\nMore importantly, unlike the stock market and other private markets that are open exclusively to accredited investors and brokers, the cryptocurrency market is public. Any investor can trade or invest in cryptocurrencies. As such, bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have become more liquid than any other stock or asset in the global stock market.\nSearch Engine Results\nBox Mining, a renowned cryptocurrency analyst, revealed that the number of Google search engine searches for the keyword \u201cbitcoin bubble\u201d has actually decreased since late 2017.\n\nAt least nobody is worried about the Bitcoin Bubble #Bitcoin #cryptocurrencies #BitcoinBubble. pic.twitter.com/d0lEbwfctS\n\u2014 boxmining (@boxmining) March 14, 2018\nThe major correction that occured in the cryptocurrency market throughout January and February has shown that due to its liquidity, long-term bubbles within the cryptocurrency market do not form.

Bill Huizenga (R-MI) as he adjourned Wednesday\u2019s US House Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment Subcommittee hearing, which was devoted to discussing cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings (ICOs), and whether the current regulatory framework adequately protects investors.\nHuizenga was speaking to a group of academics and cryptocurrency industry representatives who had testified before the subcommittee, largely arguing that regulators need to clarify the legal status of cryptoassets to help entrepreneurs innovate while remaining compliant with federal rules.\nAs was the case in a recent Senate hearing on cryptocurrency regulation, lawmakers conveyed varying opinions about the value of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\nSome committee members harped on cryptocurrency\u2019s alleged association with terrorism. Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA), for instance, called cryptocurrencies a \u201ccrock\u201d and expressed doubt that they can be used to accomplish any social good that cannot be achieved otherwise.\n\u201cPerhaps we\u2019ll have another hearing after a major terrorist event\u201d is financed using cryptocurrency,\u201d he quipped, adding elsewhere that cryptocurrencies are only \u201cpopular with guys who want to sit in their pajamas and tell their wives they\u2019re going to be millionaires.\u201d\nOthers, however, lauded ICOs and other blockchain-related fintech advancements and cautioned that hasty or overbearing regulations could threaten the country\u2019s status as a fintech leader.\n\u201cRegulation in this space is something that the U.S. has to get right, because poor or rushed policy in cryptocurrencies really threatens our reputation in finance and technology,\u201d said Rep. Ted Budd (R-NC).\nSimilarly, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN) \u2014 a member of the cryptocurrency-friendly Congressional Blockchain Caucus \u2014 criticized politicians for calling for new regulations without taking the time to research and develop an adequate understanding of the technology.\n\u201cI hear elected officials who don\u2019t have any concept of what we\u2019re dealing with here and how exciting it is talking about, \u2018Oh my gosh, we\u2019ve got to run in and regulate and create more government infrastructure,\u2019\u201d commented Emmer, adding that although there needs to be modest cryptocurrency regulation, the access to capital that ICOs provide \u201cis something Democrats and Republicans should celebrate.\u201d\nOverall though \u2014 as Huizenga remarked when he adjourned the meeting \u2014 this hearing largely served as a way to introduce lawmakers to the regulatory and operational climate in the nascent cryptcoasset space, particularly in regard to ICOs. This is not, one can be sure, the last time Congress will find itself discussing cryptocurrency regulation.", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

Because most of these firms manage less than $150 million worth of assets, they do not have to register with the SEC and are instead regulated at the state level.\nSource: Bloomberg\nThe sources familiar with the probe said that regulators want to know what methodology funds use to evaluate and price their cryptoasset investments \u2014 which often include stakes in ICO tokens \u2014 as well as their custodial policies.\nHowever, the publication also reports that the SEC\u2019s Enforcement Division has issued subpoenas to other funds, perhaps indicating that regulators believe these funds have run afoul of federal securities regulations.\nIn these cases, the SEC is apparently interested in identifying the relationships between the hedge funds and ICO operators. They also want to know whether fund managers have personally invested in the ICO tokens held by the fund without making proper disclosures.\nWord of the SEC\u2019s probe into cryptoasset hedge funds comes as the agency has been ramping up its enforcement of the ICO industry. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has repeatedly stated that the vast majority of ICOs he has observed constitute unregistered securities offerings, and the agency has fired an increasing number of warning shots in an attempt to encourage industry participants to comply with regulations.\nEarlier this month, reports emerged that the SEC had subpoenaed \u201cdozens\u201d of ICO operators and advisers and had asked others \u2014 including Overstock subsidiary tZero \u2014 to voluntarily hand over information related to their token sales.\nLast week, the SEC put cryptocurrency exchanges on notice, warning them that it is a violation of federal law to list security tokens without registering with the SEC and that it is also illegal to list security tokens whose issuers did not register as such with the SEC.", "category": "ICO News"}

The valuation of the cryptocurrency market, which hovered in the $400 billion region last week, decreased to $336 billion.\n\nAll Cryptocurrencies Decline\nToday\u2019s correction isn\u2019t exclusive to bitcoin. All major cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Cardano, and Litecoin have declined in value, at a similar rate as bitcoin. Ethereum recorded a daily loss of 10 percent, while Ripple and Bitcoin Cash both decreased by just over 9 percent.\nSome analysts have attributed the decline in price of cryptocurrencies to the ICO hearing participated by US representatives and government officials, in which several representatives including Carolyn Maloney, Representative for New York\u2019s 12th congressional district, claimed that the cryptocurrency market is a bubble.\nThe negative comments of US representatives followed a report released by $81 billion investment firm Allianz, which claimed that bitcoin has no intrinsic value and therefore, could fall in price.\u00a0\u201cIn our view, its intrinsic value must be zero.

Gox sell off, overall market performance over the past month, and negative media coverage are contributing to the decline in the value of the cryptocurrency market.\nCurrently, the media is not portraying the innovative developments being pursued within the cryptocurrency industry, especially the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies in regions like Japan and South Korea.

As covered by CCN, Maduro claims the cryptocurrency already raked in $5 billion.\nFollowing Venezuela\u2019s footsteps various countries are looking to issue their own national cryptocurrencies as well. While Iran recently backpedaled on bitcoin and revealed it\u2019s planning its own state cryptocurrency, a Turkish lawmaker has argued for a \u201cTurkcoin.\u201d\nThe Petro is pegged to Venezuela\u2019s oil reserves, and the Petro/bolivar exchange rate reportedly includes a discount determined by the Venezuelan government. This, the Brookings Institute argues, means the Petro is subject to \u201can arbitrary discount factor adjustment, fluctuating oil prices, and a corrupt government known for manipulating its currency.\u201d\nThe think tank adds:\n\u201cThere exists a very real danger that the petro will not only fail to cure Venezuela\u2019s economic woes but will also weaken the integrity of cryptocurrencies writ-large.\u201d\nThe century-old think tank further notes that foreign investors exclusively funded the Petro\u2019s pre-sale, leading to an influx of capital that shouldn\u2019t occur as Venezuela is subject to international sanctions. Since the government only accepts hard currencies, bitcoin or Ethereum for the Petro, Venezuelan\u2019s aren\u2019t able to purchase the oil-backed cryptocurrency.\nPer the institute, the Petro was essentially a deceitful way for the government to raise capital, one that won\u2019t help its citizens. Moreover, it\u2019s unclear what use the Petro has for foreign speculators, as the cryptocurrency\u2019s whitepaper claims it will be used to pay for taxes, fees, and public services in Venezuela.\nAs covered by CCN, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has ordered state-owned companies and the country\u2019s airlines to accept the Petro. Despite its presumed adoption in Venezuela, foreign investors won\u2019t even be able to exchange it for a barrel of oil.\nCircumventing sanctions\nEffectively, the Brookings Institute argues that the Venezuelan government is taking advantage of speculator hype in the cryptocurrency space to circumvent sanctions, by accumulating foreign currency.\nThe article reads:\n\u201cThe petro cannot stabilize the Venezuelan economy and instead exists to create foreign currency reserves from thin air.\u201d\nNations looking to issue their own cryptocurrencies may follow Venezuela\u2019s footsteps. Venezuela\u2019s strategy, analysts note, is to raise money through a cryptocurrency backed by a government-controlled asset, raise money, and proceed to manipulate the cryptocurrency to maximize profit.\nThis may be setting a dangerous example. While \u2018legitimate cryptocurrencies\u2019 prioritize decentralization, security, and transparency, the Petro \u201cprovides no real service for its international holders.\u201d Adding to that, the Venezuelan government has announced a new precious-metal backed cryptocurrency, the Petro Gold.\nOnce speculators find the Petro has no long-term value, Brookings argues, the idea that cryptocurrencies facilitate fraud may be strengthened. Moreover, the power of sanctions may erode if countries are able to bypass them using cryptocurrencies. If so, they may act more aggressively when facing sanctions.\nThe think tank\u2019s piece concludes:\n\u201cA hard line must be drawn on the development of empty cryptocurrencies that are ultimately a form of national illicit debt relief, or else serious and legitimate adoption of cryptocurrencies will be seriously stifled.\u201d", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The company is looking to expand in the port of Walla Walla, a city in Washington. The news was first published in a local publication, Union-Bulletin.\nThough Bitmain has not made any announcement of the expansion, the article mentions a company called Ant Creek to be the one setting shop. According to the online registration data, Ant Creek was registered in the state of Washington last year for which Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu is the sole governing person.\nAccording to the article, the Port of Walla Walla would be leasing land from early 2019 and the company will be given an option to purchase up to 40 acres in future. The Port officials have also reported that this could bring between $7 to $10 Million of private investment and up to 15-20 full-time jobs.\nAlso, Port Executive Director Patrick Reay said his agency has been working with Antcreek LLC for about six months on the development of a blockchain facility. Patrick is not concerned about electricity demand because they\u2019re not an electric purveyor.\nIf approved, the lease price is set at $4,166 USD along with an additional state leasehold tax of $535. The land Ant Creek will be leasing is known as the \u201cKelly Property\u201d.\nThis comes at a time when Bitmain had seen unprecedented profits last year. It is estimated that Bitmain made anywhere between $3 to $4 Billion USD in operating profits last year, rivalling GPU Giant NVIDIA which made $3 Billion in operating profits at the same time.\nThis expansion from Bitmain is due to the recent crackdown on Cryptocurrencies from the Chinese government. Early this year, Bitmain set a new subsidiary in Switzerland to expand out of China.

Microsoft suggest that the reason for this rise is that cyber criminals are moving to this form of attack due to the exponential increase in cryptocurrency valuations. Along the way attackers are ditching ransom and other attacks, which have seen a marked fall.\nAccording to Microsoft, malicious coin mining can come in various forms and can be distributed in many different ways. The largest increase has been in so-called cryptojacking, browser-based coin miners that use background resources to mine when a user visits their URL. However, attackers can also infect computers with unwanted applications, with some able to modify startup settings so that they run every time the infected device is booted.\nThe post notes that the main issue associated with this form of malicious attack is the loss of computer resources, as coin mining can be a highly intensive process. Corporate networks can see a huge drain on their available resources, although Windows 10 Enterprise customers reportedly benefit from Advanced Threat Prevention -a wider set of security features to tackle malicious attacks.\nWhilst Microsoft has noted successes, for example blocking a major attack earlier this month, the blog post outlines the complexity of analyzing whether a miner is a malicious attacker, as many users use the same or similar programs for personal mining purposes.\nMicrosoft aren\u2019t alone in observing an increasing amount of malicious mining attacks. An investigation by The Citizen Lab\u00a0last week discovered nationwide attacks in both Egypt and Turkey, with the attackers injecting malicious mining code over non-secured browsing connections. Alongside this development, a report from October last year observed that over 1.5 million devices had been affected at the time. Researchers were in agreement with Micorsoft regarding the causation, citing rising cryptocurrency prices as a driving factor. Popular minable currency Monero, for example, increased from $20 to an all time high of $470 over the course of 2017.\nIn order to stay protected Microsoft advise security operations personnel to use advanced behavioral and machine learning detection libraries in Windows Defender ATP to identify and eliminate potential threats. Regular users are advised that using Edge for browsing will provide \u2018Microsoft-verified security\u2019, and warned to be cautious of third-party applications.", "category": "Bitcoin Crime"}

The scammers who purport to be ATO officials have been defrauding taxpayers since late 2017, the ATO said in a notice this week. According to ATO assistant commissioner Kath Anderson, scammers have so far conned over AUD$50,000 in bitcoin alone.\nShe stated:\n\u201cWe became aware of scammers seeking payment in Bitcoin last year. So far, we have seen over $50,000 paid in Bitcoin to scammers claiming fake ATO tax debts.\u201d\nThe seismic growth of cryptocurrencies\u2019 popularity, particularly in 2017, makes it \u201cinevitable that scammers would target cryptocurrency\u201d she said. \u201cCryptocurrency operates in a virtual world, and once the scammers receive payment it\u2019s virtually impossible to get it back,\u201d the ATO official added.\nAs things stand, cryptocurrency is not a recognized method of payment by the taxation office. The ATO lists electronic bill payment system BPAY alongside a credit/debit card as the easiest way to make tax payments alongside a number of alternative options including bank transfers.\nWhile cases of cryptocurrency-related fraud are on the rise, the ATO reminded taxpayers to be wary of \u201cthe most frequently reported\u201d scams that include demands of direct deposits into third-party bank accounts, pre-paid Visa gift cards and payments in iTunes gift cards.

If you think about it, despite how many other technologies will influence, accelerate and improve the overall quality of living, like AI, VR, AR and machine learning, none can compare with cryptocurrency in terms of basic influence on people\u2019s lives. This is, in a few years everyone will definitely use some sort of cryptocurrency for payments. Why would people still want to hold onto bank accounts that have fees to maintain? I\u2019m not referring to companies or governments; I\u2019m talking about people in general. The influence cryptocurrencies can have in daily things will happen much faster than other technologies, much like the internet.\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/273018/number-of-internet-users-worldwide/\n\u2014 this article is not financial advisement, simply my opinion and thoughts. Most of my personal savings are in some form of cryptocurrency so please take whatever I say with a grain of salt. Do not invest what you cannot afford to lose\u2013\nShall we address the not-so-transparent elephant in the room?\nIn my last article, I did mention all who gain power are afraid to lose it. How enjoyable it was when today I woke up and read Google\u2019s also banning cryptocurrency ads! It wasn\u2019t so long ago that Facebook also chose to ban any cryptocurrency related ad too.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they both had solid reasons to do that\u201d\nOh man, if only that were true. If only companies actually cared about people, the outcome of so many strategies would be so different.\nToday I have a simple goal: to show you how wrong people\u2019s perception of these companies\u2019 strategies really is.\nAds Policy\nWhen you hear a company is blocking certain ads, behaviours, actions, posts, whatever it is, the reasons are most likely competitive ones. This is, the easiest way for any company to dominate the market is by shaking off competition. Let\u2019s use the two examples mentioned above.\nFacebook:\n\u201cThis policy is intentionally broad while we work to better detect deceptive and misleading advertising practices, and enforcement will begin to ramp up across our platforms including Facebook, Audience Network and Instagram. We will revisit this policy and how we enforce it as our signals improve.\u201d\u00a0 \nGoogle:\n\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t have a crystal ball to know where the future is going to go with cryptocurrencies, but we\u2019ve seen enough consumers harm or potential for consumer harm that it\u2019s an area that we want to approach with extreme caution.\u201d \nBoth companies mention more or less the same reason: to protect consumers from bad investments and scams. I mean, that seems fair right? Below we have google\u2019s adwords user policy.\nhttps://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/6008942?visit_id=1-636566250825312449-2090968679&rd=1\nFor extra details check the Financial Services section. Interestingly enough, companies are indeed allowed to advertise financial services, like personal credits, financial products, etc. So why exclude cryptocurrencies?\nDemystifying Companies\u2019\u00a0Behaviors\nThe most obvious answer is to block competitors with much more added value to advertise their products. There are people building decentralized search engines, decentralized social networks, decentralized supply-chains and decentralized everything. This means that economic incentives ARE included with the platform. You, as a user, will get money (in the form of tokens) for using those platforms or for sharing content on those platforms. The basic idea is that you always get something in return.\nThis is the true power of distributed ledger technology: when you associate it with economic incentives, virtually any product or company can be decentralized. Users of those products or companies will have more added value because there is an economic incentive working on the background to improve their experience by giving tokens for data, which can exist in many forms and shapes. Just look at:\nBitclave, a decentralized search engine: with this product you\u2019re able to get tokens for sharing data. It is literally a web browser that pays you for searching and sharing data.\nDo you think this was Google\u2019s reaction?\n\nObviously not.\nSteemit, a social network where users get paid to post content. The steemit ledger has incredible mechanics where posts actually count as transactions making the blockchain move forward. Any post you share on steemit can be upvoted by community members and each upvote will entitle to some steem dollars.\nBoth projects are backed by incredibly talented people. For example, Dan Larimer, Steemit\u2019s founder, is also coordinating the EOS project, which is considered to be one of the major contestants as a future player in the DLT protocol industry. There are many other cases of companies developing state-of-the art technology that can improve people\u2019s lives everywhere around the world. We\u2019re talking about the full digitalization of any asset with economic incentives. Meaning, any correctly implemented blockchain, with PoW as consensus mechanism, is infinitely more secure than Google\u2019s or Facebook\u2019s servers. This has been proven by Bitcoin and the blockchain, at least until now.\nWhat Now?\nAs users of Google and facebook, we have two options. Either we accept the policies and get on with our lives, or we refuse to accept them and either go away or make some noise about it.\nLeaving those platforms is hardly the right solution, as forcing people to change is literally what I\u2019m against. Raising awareness about the centralization of those platforms and sharing alternatives, that is what we should be doing.\nAt the end of the day, we all have a choice:\n(a)We can accept these companies will forever own our data and monetize it for their own profits, creating unbalance in the content creation economy and lifting barriers for competitors to enter the market (because they can ban people from posting alternatives as it\u2019s happening now);\n(b) We can instead support other projects, not only by creating content on those platforms (profiles, articles, posts, etc) but also by sharing them with others. The more people, the merrier!\nYou are now allowing these companies, which actually profit from your data,\u00a0to decide what you can and cannot see.\nRemember: if you believe in cryptocurrency at is core, spend as much time as possible thinking about it and talking about it. It\u2019s up to all of us to teach and share how this wonderful technology works and the numerous advantages it brings for its users.\n\nJoin me, and together we can rule the galaxy", "category": "Bitcoin Op-ed"}

Abra is doing the same thing but using Litecoin and Bitcoin instead of USD with Abra acting as the counterparty (i.e. the other signatory) to the P2SH scripts.\u201d\nAbra is able to offer this service because it also runs a market-making operation, which hedges away the firm\u2019s counterparty risk in the case that asset values fluctuate wildly.\nThe platform does not charge commission fees on trades, though \u2014 as with Circle\u2019s recently-launched investing app \u2014 it nets a small profit on the spread between buy and sell prices.\nAbra previously allowed users to use this technology to invest in Ether and a few fiat currencies, and it claims that it successfully processed hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of transactions using this system with zero service interruptions.\nThe app has no geographic restrictions, so it is available to users throughout the world.

An initial contract with the company ended after being analyzed in 2010, as Induspan was charging above market prices, despite employing prisoners at very low rates.\nAfter Induspan stopped supplying the prisons, Paiva created a non-profit organization dubbed Primus Initiative. Primus started supplying Rio de Janeiro\u2019s prisons with snacks using Induspan\u2019s rates.\nAccording to a prosecutor of the state\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Group, Silvio Ferreira de Carvalho Neto, the price being charged for bread surged every time the contract was renewed, and in 13 years grew by nearly 1,000 percent. Moreover, the number of supplied snacks supposedly went from 55,600 to 83,600 per day, although the number of prisoners that needed to be fed remained the same.\nThe scheme, according to Carvalho Neto, netted Primus a total of $22.4 million between 2010 and 2015. At least $13.7 million were reportedly laundered through fake tourism and exchange companies. The official stated:\n\u201cThey were set up or, above all, reactivate to receive the money. In that period, none of them had employees, bank or a service rendered. In fact, receiving amounts for shortly after withdrawing from the cash and transferring to foreign exchanges is a very clear signal that the appeal was paid without any consideration. \u201c", "category": "Bitcoin Crime"}

Filed as Senate Bill (SB) 1694, the senator specifically pointed to illegal activities involving cryptocurrency such as bribery of public officials in bitcoin, using crypto in payments for child pornography and scammers pedaling \u2018fake bitcoins\u2019 for unsuspecting adopters.\n\u201c[O]ur penal laws must adapt with the changing times and our criminal justice system must come prepared in the even that this is used in illegal activities,\u201d she said, signaling caution in their abuse amid the advent and increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies in society.\nThe bill also proposes that the \u2018gravity\u2019 of the subsequent sentence should factor in the cryptocurrency\u2019s value in Philippine pesos at the time of the crime. Further, De Lima\u2019s bill also calls for the government to confiscate the cryptocurrency used in the crime, unless it is a property of a separate individual not liable for the illegal act.\nElaborating on the reasons for the bill, she added:\n\u201cDue to its anonymous or pseudonymous character, law enforcement agencies may encounter difficulty in tracing the user or owner of a virtual currency used in the commission of crimes, thereby necessitating a higher penalty for its use.\u201d\nThe proposed bill, which will need to be passed into law before any stiffer penalties are imposed, comes at a time when Philippine regulators are actively developing guidelines to curb fraud and investor risks in cryptocurrency transactions and initial coin offerings (ICOs). Notably, both Philippines\u2019 central bank and the country\u2019s securities regulator are collaborating over the effort, first revealed by central ban kgovernor Nestor Espenilla late last year after acknowledging the \u201cstrong growth potential in the [ICO] space\u201d.\nThe Philippines is notably among the earliest countries, globally, to issue regulations for the cryptocurrency sector in early 2017.

As election suspense heightened, a Swiss blockchain startup, Agora, was working hard behind the scenes to help process and tally the results using blockchain technology.\nIn this particular election, Agora utilized a custom permissioned blockchain technology that it has built over the last two years. According to Monax, permissioned blockchain networks allow the network to appoint a group of participants in the network who are given the express authority to provide the validation of blocks of transactions or to participate in consensus.\nFor Agora and Sierra Leone officials, this meant the secure transfer of information to a verifiable blockchain ledger, where independent node operators including the Red Cross, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, and the University of Fribourg were able to tally and verify each ballot and the election results. Leo Gammar, the CEO of Agora, told CCN, \u201cI am grateful to Sierra Leone for showing the world how visionary they are in bringing free and transparent elections to their people.\u201d\nFor Sierra Leone, this election was particularly notable, as it was also the first time in the country\u2019s history that more than two candidates had a significant chance of winning, creating the possibility for a more diversified parliament. Historically since 1961, the ruling All People\u2019s Congress (APC) party and the Sierra Leone People\u2019s Party (SLPP) have dominated the country\u2019s parliament. A total of 16 candidates were on the ballot in this election.\nThis event marks an important first step towards improving the democratic process in countries historically impacted by fraud and corruption with paper ballots. While still early, the implications of blockchain voting could be transformative to democracies around the world. Blockchain technology improves upon previous digital voting systems by ensuring transparency, safety and voter anonymity.\nAccording to Jaron Lukasiewicz, Agora\u2019s COO, additional benefits of using a blockchain voting system versus paper ballots include reduced costs, the removal of human error and faster public access to election results. He explained, \u201cAll elections in the future will use blockchain voting systems.

According to Bannon, the centralized control and constant deflation of fiat currencies is a form of slavery, keeping citizens spinning on the wheel. The audience was told that \u201ccentral banks are in the business of debasing your currency\u201d, and he suggested cryptocurrencies as a way to challenge them. Because banks cannot control them, Bannon described cryptocurrencies as the heart of the anti-establishment movement, empowering citizens, companies, and governments alike.\nCryptocurrencies were described as a way to escape from bank\u2019s control of fiat currencies, but Bannon also identified the centralized control of data as a huge issue. Whilst Bannon was less clear here, it seems he understood the potential of decentralized blockchain technology to put data back in the hands of people.\nBannon is well known for serving as White House Chief Strategist during at the beginning of Trump\u2019s presidential term, but he has also worked as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs. He knows the financial system well, and repeated the mantra that was drilled into him and others every single day: \u201cincrease shareholder value\u201d. His comments come as part of his strongly anti-establishment political stance.\nWhilst some will embrace Bannon\u2019s endorsement of cryptocurrency, others in the space will not be best pleased. Bannon\u2019s political stance is firmly nationalist and considerably right-wing, which flies in the face of many who support cryptocurrency as global and liberal movement seeking to overcome national boundaries. He co-founded Breitbart news, a right-wing publication, and is highly vocal about reducing immigration and strengthening national borders.\nThe well-known figure is no stranger to virtual currency, with it being reported last year that he had spent $60 million on World of Warcraft currency.

So far, Multicoin Capital raised over $50 million.\nApart from Andreessen Horowitz partners including Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon, former PayPal CEO Davic Sacks, Color Genomics co-founder Elad Gil, and Craft Ventures partner Bill Lee invested in the cryptocurrency hedge fund, Multi-coin Capital co-founder Kyle Samani told Fortune.\nSamani noted that cryptocurrencies have recently become a legitimate and a rapidly growing asset class, a sentiment that was shared by several executives in the traditional finance sector including JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, who previously explained that the emergence of futures exchanges could allow bitcoin to compete with gold in the long-term.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is the next wave of serious investment coming to an exciting, recently-legitimized asset class,\u201d said Samani, emphasizing that the cryptocurrency market is still at its early phase in terms of adoption, development, liquidity, and infrastructure.\nAlthough the valuation of the cryptocurrency market remains below $0.5 trillion and it is still a relatively small market in comparison to traditional assets like gold, Samani said that cryptocurrencies have an advantage over traditional assets due to its liquidity.\nIn the cryptocurrency market, any individual trader or investor can freely invest in any cryptocurrency or token without the need for accredition or formal verification. As such, the cryptocurrency market enables anyone to invest freely, providing significant liquidity to both large and small cryptocurrencies or blockchain projects.\n\u201cWhile there are lots of similarities between crypto investing and traditional startup investing, there are many differences. Most obviously, crypto assets become liquid much sooner in their life cycles than traditional private equity. In addition to liquidity, everything in crypto is open source, which requires thinking about investing in a fundamentally different way,\u201d said Samani.\nMany major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, OKEx, Huobi, Upbit, and Bithumb are processing over a billion dollars in cryptocurrency trades. Binance, OKEx, and Huobi, three of the largest exchanges in the world, only provide cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency support, and still process nearly $1.5 billion worth of trades on a daily basis, a volume that surpasses stock markets in most economies like South Korea.\nLong-Term\nBut, unlike the other 200 cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds that are generally targeting short to mid-term profits and returns, Multicoin Capital is seeking for long-term returns. Given the exponential growth rate of the cryptocurrency market, 3 to 4 years in the cryptocurrency market is comparable to 30 to 40 years in traditional markets, primarily because the cryptocurrency market operates 24/7.\nIn regards to the long-term growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies, the acknowledgement of the asset class by key venture capital firms and angel investors can be considered as an optimistic sign, especially in a volatile period like this.", "category": "Bitcoin & Blockchain Investments"}

The announcement came during a meeting with members of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), in Caracas.\nDuring the meeting, Maduro explained that the money raised from the cryptocurrency\u2019s pre-sale will be used to \u201cservice everything our country needs.\u201d Per his words, the money is part of a wider \u201ceconomic solution\u201d the Venezuelan government put together.\nAdditionally Carlos Vargas, the country\u2019s cryptocurrency superintendent, revealed that over 83,000 individuals from 127 countries attempted to purchase the oil-backed cryptocurrency. Among them, were 3,523 entrepreneurs. As previously covered by CCN, the country had received 171,000 pre-registrations for the token sale, and Maduro claimed it raised $735 million in only a day.\n\nCarlos Vargas: 34 pa\u00edses han confirmado su intenci\u00f3n de participar en el #Petro, pero son much\u00edsimos m\u00e1s.

Unencrypted traffic, (that uses\u00a0http, not https) was redirected to browser cryptocurrency mining scripts. The researchers suggest this was done in order to extract revenue from unsuspecting internet users.\nThe report also identified the same malicious system being used in Turkey to inject citizen\u2019s devices with spyware. Both Egypt and Turkey have been increasingly authoritarian in recent years, breaching multiple human rights obligations. Reporters Without Borders ranked Egypt 161st out of 180 currencies in its 2017 World Press Freedom Index, and 800 people have been sentenced to death since 2013. Journalists, human rights defenders, and protesters have experienced mass arrests, disappearances, and torture.\nAfter an extensive investigation, the team was able to track the network injections from both Egypt and Turkey to Sandvine PacketLogic devices \u2013 an American-based firm which sold the Turkish system as part of a $6,000,000 contract. At the time the deal caused a prominent member of the company to resign in protest.\nAttitudes to cryptocurrency are split in the highly religious Egypt. Earlier this year Egypt\u2019s foremost religious leader called for a blockchain ban, stating that Bitcoin was illegal under Sharia law.\nWhilst some authorities in Egypt are against the technology, the attackers are likely making large amounts of money. A report from Talos earlier this month, a leading cyber security intelligence firm, estimates that malicious mining could be netting attackers over $100m a year.\u00a0The report estimated that each infected device can generate about 28 cents a day. With 2000 devices that adds up to $568 per day, and $200,000 a year. It\u2019s likely however that the nation-wide system uncovered could have many many more devices infected \u2013 leading to much higher profits.\nThis type of attack has grown hugely in recent years, with malware research labs alleging that over 1.5 million devices have been affected. Website owners have deployed the technology as an alternative to ad-hosting. However, the primary use has been by hackers who slide the system onto internet users without them knowing.\nThe news of Egypt and Turkey\u2019s use of the software comes as a reminder not only of the shaky human rights situation in these countries, but of state-sanctioned spying globally. As we progress through 2018 the internet is increasingly becoming less of a tool to connect citizens, and more a weapon to spy on them.", "category": "Bitcoin Mining"}

Although major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have recorded gains over the past 24 hours, most cryptocurrencies have started to fall again.\nBitcoin\u2019s Volatility\nOn March 10, bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies recorded over 10 percent in daily gains, triggering enthusiasm within the global cryptocurrency market. Ethereum in particular along with tokens increased by nearly 13 percent, while bitcoin recovered back to the $9000 region.\nBut, in the past several hours, bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies have started to decline again, as the market continued to be volatile. Bitcoin has dropped below the $9,000 mark after reaching $9,500. In fact, within the past 3 hours, bitcoin has dropped $500, despite the momentum it gained throughout the past 24 hours.\nWithin a span of four days, bitcoin went from $11,600 to $8,300, increased to $9,400, and declined to $8,950. Bitcoin\u2019s extreme volatility is reflected by the market, which has followed the volatile trend of bitcoin throughout this week.\n\nMany analysts have attributed the decline in the price of bitcoin and the volatility of the market to the sell off of bitcoin by the Mt. Gox trustee. According to the official document released by the trustee, over $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin are yet to be sold.\nThe issue with the sell off is that the Mt. Gox trustee intends to sell the remaining bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges, rather than in the over-the-counter market. Massive sell orders can drastically impact the cryptocurrency market especially in a recovery period like this, when volumes are relatively low on most cryptocurrency exchanges. \nThere are optimistic developments being pursued in Japan, South Korea, and other regions that could significantly improve the adoption of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Japan in the mid to long-term. Today, CCN reported that South Korea\u2019s largest internet conglomerate Kakao, which operates KakaoTalk, KakaoPay, KakaoTaxi, KakaoStory, Dunamoo (UpBit), and many other applications, plans to integrate cryptocurrencies by the end of 2018.\nBut, in the short-term, despite the innovative developments in the cryptocurrency sector, most cryptocurrencies including bitcoin will likely remain extremely volatile in the range of $9,000 to $11,000, until a major break occurs and the cryptocurrency market moves in an upward manner at a similar rate as December 2017.\nEthereum and Alternative Cryptocurrencies\nAnalysts are divided on the future trend of Ethereum and its performance against Ethereum. Some have claimed that bitcoin will likely remain as the best performing cryptocurrency as newcomers come into the market and invest in the dominant cryptocurrency first, before moving to other cryptocurrencies.\nSome state that the performance of tokens could push the price of Ethereum up in the short-term, especially in a period in which all tokens are down about 50 percent from their all-time highs.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

The platform exchanges cryptocurrencies for euros and relies upon banks for its service, but they\u2019re becoming increasingly wary due to uncertainty regarding the legality of the operations.\nCryptocurrency regulation is currently unclear, but banks are erring on caution. They\u2019re particularly wary of involvement with money laundering, believing the anonymous or pseudo-anonymous nature of virtual currencies to be shaky legal ground. An agreement was reached at the European Union last year which we would see cryptocurrency fall under the same anti-money laundering regulation as fiat funds, and whilst this is not yet being enforced, banks are keeping well clear of involvement.\nThe Prasos platform has lost its connection with banks following a tenfold increase in volume since the prior year, with the $185m sum raising suspicions among institutions.\nFounded in 2012, the Prasos team were united by the vision of a societal revolution using blockchain technology, stating their mission as to provide services that are easy to use to spread blockchain adoption.\n\u201cWe believe cryptocurrencies are a way of equalizing societal power structures as they allow regular people the chance to control their own money.\u201d\nPrasos, in fact, hosts six separate services, and boast five years of expertise in blockchain technology, currently specializing in the development of Lightning Networks.

Kakao is also planning to launch its own cryptocurrency, similar to the model of Binance\u2019s Binance Coin, within this year.\nOnce KakaoPay integrates cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum, all the other Kakao apps would become \u00a0compatible with cryptocurrency payments. If Kakao pursues its plan to integrate cryptocurrencies into KakaoPay by the end of 2018, millions of KakaoTaxi, KakaoTalk, and other Kakao applications will soon be able to utilize cryptocurrencies.\nLast year, Dunamoo, a subsidiary company of Kakao, launched UpBit, the first cryptocurrency-only exchange in South Korea. Within a few months, UpBit became one of the top five cryptocurrency exchanges in the market. Dunamoo\u2019s launch of UpBit is considered by analysts as the first move Kakao made to enter the cryptocurrency market.\nThe massive success of UpBit and the rising demand for cryptocurrency from local investors likely led Kakao to focus on addressing the market, given that other companies like Bithumb have already secured large partnerships with the country\u2019s largest e-commerce platforms and retailers in WeMakePrice and Yeogi Eottae to integrate cryptocurrencies into their existing payment infrastructures.\nKakao\u2019s market penetration in South Korea exceeds the 90 percent mark, in all three areas: messaging, taxi service, and fintech. KakaoPay is the most dominant fintech application in the local market, and it is used by many millennials as an alternative to the South Korean banking system, as KakaoPay offers loans and provides virtual bank accounts, apart from settling both small and large transactions.\nThe integration of cryptocurrency by Kakao will immediately expose bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies to tens of millions of people that utilize Kakao on a daily basis. Kakao\u2019s dominance in the South Korean market has come to a point in which devices like smartphones come with Kakao applications installed.\nIncreasing Adoption\nAs CCN reported, South Korea\u2019s largest hotel booking platform Yeogi Eottae has already secured a partnership with the country\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb to integrate cryptocurrencies. \nBithumb has started to supply cryptocurrency kiosks to many restaurants, cafes, and food franchises in South Korea, to increase the adoption of cryptocurrency and provide a better way for South Koreans to spend cryptocurrencies casually, on a daily basis, without technical issues.", "category": "Bitcoin Business"}

They were followed by people in their 30s by 19.3%, 40s by 12%, 60s by 10.5% and 50s by 8.2%.\nHowever, 60-year-olds were the ones who invested the largest amount of money in cryptocurrencies with an average total of\u00a06.58 million won ($6,119).\u00a050, 40, 30 and 20 year olds invested 6.28 million won ($5,840), 3.99 million won, 3.73 million won ($3,710) and 29.3 million won ($2,724) respectively.\u00a0Altogether,\u00a070.2% bought cryptocurrencies as a means of investment, while 34.1% bought it to pay for goods and services.\nOther Surveys on Cryptocurrency Adopters\nApart from South Korea, Venture capital company, Blockchain Capital, surveyed over 2,000 Americans from ages 18-to-34 in Nov. 2017. The results showed that 30% \u201cwould rather own $1,000 worth of Bitcoin than $1,000 of government bonds or stocks\u201d, but only 2% of them owned cryptocurrency currently or in the past. Blockchain Capital\u2019s\u00a0managing director, Spence Bogart, said, \u201cthe results of the survey reinforce our conviction in the massive opportunity that lies ahead for Bitcoin.\u201d\nAnother survey by UK-based cryptocurrency exchange,\u00a0London Block, in Dec. 2017 showed that out of 2,000 Britons,\u00a05% of those below 45 years of age were investors in cryptocurrency, while 11% were planning to invest next year. It was also reported that 2018 is the year where one-third of millennials are expected to invest in cryptocurrencies.\nThus, millennials show a different approach towards investment when compared to their ancestors. A 35-year-old in the 1990s would be looking at real estate for purchasing properties, buying\u00a0Certificates of Deposit (CDs), or purchasing retirement packages. But a 35-year-old nowadays plans to put more money into the decentralized future of investments\u00a0\u2013 buying BTC, ETH or contributing in ICOs.\nAnalysts even said that people are choosing Bitcoin over gold \u2013 last year,\u00a0RJO Futures\u2019\u00a0Phillip Streible said,\u00a0\u201cBitcoin has stolen a large market share of gold.\u201d\u00a0Throwing some light on this topic,\u00a0cryptocurrency expert\u00a0Garrick Hileman, explained that, \u201cmillennials began their income generating years during the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, and many don\u2019t completely trust traditional financial services\u00a0 or the system in which they operate.\u201d", "category": "News"}

With a market cap of around $5 billion, it is currently the eleventh most valuable cryptocurrency. Unlike others, however, IOTA has its own unique spin on the blockchain tech, called Tangle. It is also able to boast zero transaction fees.\nIn recent times, IOTA\u2019s heritage in the German capital has clearly attracted several indigenous companies with deep pockets. For instance, the Chief Digital Officer of Volkswagen Group, Johann Jungwirth, is one of the board members of the IOTA Foundation. Bosch Group, through its venture capital arm, RBVC, has also invested an undisclosed amount and works closely with the foundation.\nWhen interviewed by Bloomberg, IOTA co-founder\u00a0Dominik Schiener shared his belief that with these new partnerships, IOTA is heading for the \u201cnext growth cycle\u201d. There are also rumors circulating in the crypto community surrounding a possible smart contracts-like feature in IOTA. Setting up multiple offices around the world, including ones in Canada, Japan, Norway and South Korea, is perhaps in anticipation of explosive growth following these changes.\nDevelopers and mathematicians hired by the IOTA Foundation to work on the cryptocurrency are paid in IOTA tokens and not fiat currency. The foundation has accrued over 300,000 Euros in IOTA donations from users of the currency, according to Dominik.\nSchiener\u2019s first stint with cryptocurrencies was back in 2013 when he attempted to start his own digital trading exchange at the age of 17. The project, however, completely failed to take off, causing him to lose his investment of around 500,000 Euro.

It can be viewed as a decentralized Alipay application based on blockchain technology.\nEntapay derives its name from the Quantum Mechanical Phenomenon of Quantum Entanglement, according to the website, which features secure encryption and transmission of information. As a multi-functional payment system, Entapay removes the inconvenience of managing multi-digital currencies, the laborious process of trading, and insufficient physical trading sites.\nEntapay will provide off-line exchange services for other cryptocurrencies.\nThe website further claims Entapay will replace VISA as the mainstream payment method.\nEntrepreneurs Face Uncertainty\nCryptocurrency entrepreneurs, meanwhile, warn that Cambodia\u2019s laws governing cryptocurrency are uncertain, since the government has opposed cryptocurrencies while supporting their technology, according to The Pnom Penh Post.\nThe National Bank of Cambodia has been reluctant to support cryptocurrency, according to Mean, the lead developer of the Khmer Crypto Foundation. In Mean, who has developed KHCoin, a cryptocurrency, said he understood the government\u2019s uncertainty, given the scams, volatility and lack of regulation that have plagued cryptocurrencies in general.\nKHCoin is an open source project released under the MIT/X11 license, according to its website. Source code can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/khcoin.\nThe national bank in December declared cryptocurrency transactions illegal when Mean tried to monetize KHCoin after first offering it for free. The bank banned banks and microfinance institutions from buying, selling and advertising cryptocurrencies.\nThe nation\u2019s banks, in response, prevented customers from using their bank accounts to buy or sell cryptocurrencies. This made it difficult for people to trade in cryptocurrencies even though the government had not outlawed people from owning them.\nAlso read: Cambodia\u2019s central bank plans blockchain trials toward cashless economy\nNational Bank Explores Blockchain\nPrior to its December action, the national bank began exploring blockchain technology, which provides the technology for cryptocurrencies. The bank signed an agreement last April with a Japanese firm to develop a blockchain project to track interbank transactions and lending.\nSteve Miller, the founder of CryptoAsia, a Cambodia based blockchain group, said the national bank\u2019s project is a private blockchain, which is a database without a verification process, and that the verification process \u2013 known as mining \u2013 makes cryptocurrencies necessary. He said cryptocurrencies are needed for public blockchains to function properly since they provide the incentive for anonymous participants to secure the system.\nThe national bank\u2019s restrictions on cryptocurrencies have undermined developers\u2019 efforts to pursue blockchain technology.\nRithy Thul, a blockchain entrepreneur seeking to facilitate overseas remittance payments in Cambodia, said blockchain\u2019s future in Cambodia remains uncertain. He said it is a good sign that the national bank is trying to use blockchain technology.\nDApact, a company working to use blockchain technology to connect lenders to borrowers without the need for an intermediary, has launched a $10,000 pilot project in the country, according to its website, and is seeking investors.\nPierre-Marie Riviere, the network lead of DApact, said blockchain technology is already being deployed in the country.\nMean, meanwhile, is still hoping to monetize KHCoin project.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

A new report from a mainstream Korean publication, however, could see Korean financial authorities formulate a plan to allow ICOs for domestic investors.\nCiting an anonymous source, the Korea Times is reporting discussions between financial authorities who are preparing to allow ICOs under certain conditions that are yet to be revealed.\nThe source, who is the publication claims is familiar with discussions, stated:\n\u201cThe financial authorities have been talking to the country\u2019s tax agency, justice ministry and other relevant government offices about a plan to allow ICOs in Korea when certain conditions are met.\u201d\nThe current regulatory climate for cryptocurrencies and adopters in Korea is a markedly different from widely-reported whispers \u2013 since December \u2013 of a possible ban on cryptocurrency trading in the country. The government has since moved to ban anonymous crypto trading while adopting an encouraging stance in recent weeks. Throughout it all, Korean authorities haven\u2019t crippled investors from investing in foreign ICOs despite outlawing the fundraising model domestically.\nFinancial Services Commission (FSC) official Kang Young-soo, in charge of cryptocurrency trading policies at the country\u2019s primary financial regulator, revealed the authority hasn\u2019t yet made a call on allowing domestic investors and companies to participate in ICOs.\n\u201cThere are many speculating about the possibility of allowing ICOs,\u201d the official told the publication. \u201cThe FSC has acknowledged a third-party view regarding the issue, but there\u2019s nothing that we can say officially at the moment.\u201d\nThe news follows previous remarks by FSC vice-chairman Kim Yong-beom hinting at backtracking from the sweeping ban, if only to allow institutional investors to take part in ICO fundraising while keeping it away from \u201cregular citizens how are not informed of its technology and complicity.\u201d However, today\u2019s report suggests that the rules could be eased to allow both professional and retail domestic investors partake in ICOs.", "category": "ICO News"}

It does look similar to a bubble burst, doesn\u2019t it?\n\u2013disclaimer: my opinions and views are not financial advisements. I have personally invested in projects mentioned in this article\u2013\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com\nMore than 70% of the market value was wiped out in just a few days. There is one really great aspect about all this: the market is still there and most companies are still here (with a few exceptions of course). The meaning is, cryptocurrency does not have the same behaviour as other markets due to the fact anyone can easily participate (no KYC, regulation, etc) and even though currencies like bitcoin take hits of -70%, they still exist and they grow past to new price record levels.\nhttps://trends.google.com/trends\nWho were the most notorious sellers?\nTake a guess! Yes, dumb money, so small investors who bought at high prices and due to the crowd feeling scared, sold at lower prices.\nAll the above reasons are more than important for predictive analytics and crowd sentiment analysis platforms to exist and help investors making better, more informed decisions. Below are some questions, you as an individual investor should ask, when investing in projects. Imagine how hard it can be finding the right information without the power of AI and machine learning, analyzing both open-source data and the sentiment of crowds:\n1. Are news generally positive or negative regarding each coin?\n2. Are people posting positive or negative comments regarding a certain coin?\n3. What is the market cap vs funding spending?\n4. What are the reviews and ratings for each ICO?\n5. What is people\u2019s sentiment towards the team?\n6. How engaged is the community around the project?\n7. What industry does the coin affect?\n8. Are there many similar coins?\nThese are just some basic questions many investors ask themselves when deciding to re-allocate funding or investing into a new company. Sanbase-low, for example, might help by analyzing important emotional information from crowds as well as financial indicators like projects ether burn rate, market capitalization vs burn rate and other financial data.\nWhat other factors directly influence your portfolio performance?\nBesides data availability, transformation and analysis, the most important and decisive factor is the role emotions play.\n\u201cThe best investors are emotionless towards an asset\u201d\nHow many times have you heard this? It\u2019s so further from the truth it hurts.\nWell, not as much as Phineas Gage got hurt that\u2019s for sure. This gentleman was a factory worker who lived during the 19th century and I will use his case as an example that, the best investors are not the ones who are emotionless, but rather the ones who can actually use emotions in a positive way during the decision-making process.\nOur dear Phineas suffered a tragic event that would change his life forever, as one day while he was at work a metal bar pierced through his skull damaging his brain. Although Phineas recovered and was able to regain motor skills, his pre-frontal cortex was destroyed rendering him incapable of making decisions. His behaviour was heavily affected and his personality completely changed. Because his emotional connection to his past experiences was damaged by the accident, he became incapable of making decisions, even the most basic ones.\nAntonio Damasio, a renowned Portuguese physiologist who deeply studied Phineas case published quite interesting findings. The one that I find the most important for this article is that\u00a0emotion and reason are so deeply connected it\u2019s impossible to separate one from the other.\nEach decision we make is connected not only to a mental emotion associated to memories, but also to a physical feeling. That\u2019s why we do learn from experience, mostly from mistakes: the worse, the better. If we lose that connection we become incapable of making decisions.\nHow can we leverage the role of emotion in the decision-making process?\nThat is the million dollar question isn\u2019t it? Each of us has a different response to different stimulations. Some prefer to go with gut feelings, others with extensive data analysis and some with the wisdom of the crowds. Discarding the role emotion plays in any decision is, without a doubt, really dumb.\nMy advice is to leverage technology understanding in order to make better decisions. This is, if there are tools available which can help you better rationalizing\u00a0an event, dealing emotionally with it and then making the best decision with the most positive outcome possible, you should definitely use them. It seems we\u2019re starting to have the power of crowd sentiment analysis and extensive data analysis just some clicks away.\nPredictive analytics can be very useful to understand how your logic holds when compared to the markets. There are already some platforms available like Stox, Augur or Gnosis. Remember Santiment? Great, use all these tools to test your feelings towards an asset. How did you do? Was it hyped? Undervalued? What about crowd sentiment, was it aligned with yours?\nIf you want alerts for crowd-validated news check CoinMarketCal, Snip and ClearPoll.\u00a0 Now, my only piece of advice for this round is:\nBuy when there\u2019s blood; sell when there\u2019s hype.\nEasy, right? Full disclosure: If it were no one would lose money on the market. Linking Round 1 with Round 2 is important so that we all can understand that any decision we make is intertwined with a bunch of emotional responses that come from experiences.\nRemember the dumb money vs smart money dilemma? This is the answer:\nNot ignoring your emotions and using different data analytic and crowd sentiment tools to better comprehend how you can improve emotional responses to different events.\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com\nhttps://trends.google.com/trends\nJust compare the price action of bitcoin vs the number of times bitcoin gets a hit on google. There is, without a doubt, a clear correlation between exponential price movements and the number of people googling bitcoin as this obviously happens due to media hype (FUD and FOMO).\nAt the end of the day, for some investors to win, others need to lose. To be on the winning side one must first lose a great deal of battles (and most likely a bunch of money), so one learns how to better make decisions on the next round.\nLeverage your experiences and emotions when making decisions and don\u2019t be afraid to use them. Whatever feeling you might have towards an asset or an event, listen to it.\nTest your hypothesis and register the outcome. Repeat until master. ", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

The process has seen the Ministry\u2019s information and software services division and the China Electronics Standardization Institute propose a new technical committee to be established.\nAs things stand, China is a part of the technical committee TC 307 under the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) alongside 30 other participating countries working toward international standards for blockchain technology. As reported previously, the ISO appointed Australia to lead the international effort which now sees 7 ISO blockchain standards under development.\nAcknowledging China\u2019s participation in the ISO endeavor, the IT ministry claimed \u201cpositive progress\u201d in researching standards for core blockchain facets including identity authentication and smart contracts.

However, the NEM price (XEM) not only resisted this bearish trend \u2014 it actually managed to achieve a double-digit percentage increase against the US dollar.\nAt present, NEM is trading at $0.44 on Poloniex, which is roughly in line with the token\u2019s global average. NEM has a market cap of just under $4 billion, which makes it the 11th-largest cryptocurrency according to this metric.\nXEM Price Chart | Source: TradingView\nNEM trading volume is currently heavily concentrated in Asian markets, with the majority of it denominated in fiat trading pairs.

Today, though, those tokens are worth just $225 million at market prices.\nHowever, Coincheck is compensating users at 88.549 JPY per token (~$0.83) \u2014 nearly double the present exchange rate \u2014 for a total payout of approximately $415 million. Presumably, most users will use their refunds to purchase NEM tokens, and \u2014 given the disparity between the refund price and market price \u2014 it is likely that many will increase their holdings over what they had before the hack.\nIndeed, this appears to be the case, as Zaif\u2019s XEM/JPY pair accounts for more than one-fourth of NEM\u2019s global trading volume.\nNEM trading volume rarely eclipses $100 million, so it is quite conceivable that the Coincheck payout could place significant upward pressure on the NEM price \u2014 if investors continue to inject those funds back into XEM markets, that is.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

DEX platforms are not completely safe since their website servers are centralized, but they are much less vulnerable to large-scale thefts than conventional exchanges.\nThe reason that currently-existent DEX platforms are not more widely used is that by-and-large, they can only be used to trade assets that run on a common blockchain.

He\u2019s been part of Zip2, X.com, SpaceX, Tesla, SolarCity, Hyperloop, OpenAi, Neuralink and now The Boring Company (with flamethrowers).\nThroughout these projects one theme is apparent. His aim is to help the human race deal with a variety of issues that are currently being experienced or will be a major issue in the future. This includes dealing with the fossil fuel consumption levels in the car industry by developing an electric car company called Tesla, as well as looking towards space exploration through his SpaceX company.\nTherefore, when Elon Musk speaks or does anything for that matter, people take notice. This is why when he was pictured with a book about cryptocurrency in his hand, the internet rumor mills went crazy.\nThe Book in Question\nThe book that Elon Musk was pictured holding is called Cryptocurrencies Simply Explained by Julian Hosp. This is a short book that provides a basic insight into the world of cryptocurrency, blockchain, bitcoin, decentralization and initial coin offerings.\nThe author, Dr. Julian Hosp is involved with a number of companies in the blockchain space, with the most prominent of those being a FinTech firm called TenX that specializes in the areas of bitcoin and blockchain. On his website, he makes clear his vision as helping at least 1 billion people to understand blockchain by 2025.\nA lot of people in the crypto community are excited after seeing Musk pictured with a book related to the digital currency space. There are many theories as to why he has this book in his hands, with some speculating that he was simply handed it by someone.\nOthers, however, are a lot more optimistic and believe that Musk may be considering making some sort of headway in this space, perhaps by creating his own digital token that can be used in his Tesla and SpaceX businesses.\nHe is of course well versed in online payment systems, having the email payment and online financial services company he co-founded called X.com acquired by PayPal in the year 2000.\nHe subsequently went on to become the CEO of PayPal before being ousted in October 2000 due to issues with other leaders in the company. When the company was sold to eBay in 2002, Musk was the largest shareholder, with 11.7% of the company\u2019s shares and he received approximately $165 million through this sale.\nWith this background in payment services, it wouldn\u2019t be a far stretch to imagine Musk incorporating some form of blockchain technology or digital token into how his current businesses operate or even as a separate entity.\nHe does have somewhat of a small track record in the cryptocurrency space as an investor. He revealed that he has only owned 0.25 bitcoin that a friend gave him years ago. At the time of writing, this was worth approximately $2,330 which is not exactly a significant investment for a person with Musk\u2019s net worth.\nHowever, this does not mean that he doesn\u2019t believe in blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies as a whole, so it will be interesting to watch what related moves, if any, he makes in the future.", "category": "News"}

This gives crypto-asset transactions an element of anonymity, much like cash transactions.\u201d\nElsewhere in the post, which bears the ominous title \u201cAddressing the Dark Side of the Crypto World,\u201d Lagarde explained that she believes DLT and other digital technologies can be used by financial regulators across the globe to \u201ccommunicate seamlessly\u201d and create registries of customer information and digital signatures that would be linked to biometric information.\n\u201cIndeed, the same innovations that power crypto-assets can also help us regulate them,\u201d she said. \u201cTo put it another way, we can fight fire with fire.\u201d\nPreviously, Lagarde has said that cryptocurrency regulation is \u201cinevitable\u201d and has harped on this technology\u2019s associations with illicit activities.\nBut though marketed as a way to combat terrorism and other nefarious activities, it\u2019s easy \u2014 as\u00a0Motherboard noted in its coverage of the proposal \u2014 to see Lagarde\u2019s vision for a DLT-based surveillance platform leading to a \u201cdystopian scenario\u201d in which governments use DLT to track not only the movement of money but also people.\n\u201cAs I have said before, it would not be wise to dismiss crypto-assets; we must welcome their potential but also recognize their risks,\u201d Lagarde concluded. \u201cBy working together, and leveraging technology for the public good, we can harness the potential of crypto-assets while ensuring that they never become a haven for illegal activity or a source of financial vulnerability.\u201d\nMeanwhile, a growing number of regulators are calling for international coordination on cryptocurrency regulation.

At present, shares are only offered through private placement and are restricted to accredited investors who purchase at least $10,000 worth of shares.\nThe Ethereum Classic Trust will be Grayscale\u2019s second product to be quoted on an OTC market. The firm\u2019s most well-known product, the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCQX: GBTC) has been publicly-quoted since 2015 and is a favorite among retail investors.\nShares, however, are not currently redeemable for the underlying assets, so its price often diverges from its net asset value (NAV) based on supply and demand. Demand for GBTC is so high that its shares regularly trade at a 60 percent or greater premium over its NAV. On Monday, GBTC shares closed at $15.16, approximately 67 percent over the fund\u2019s $9.07 NAV, according to data from pseudonymous trader BambouClub.\nAs CCN reported, Grayscale has launched a slew of new funds in 2018, doubling the size of its product line.

The market cap was just shy of $1 billion. Close to $200 million had traded in the last 24 hours. The currency has a total supply of almost 200 million coins.\nSource: Coinmarketcap.com\nBinance Coin ranked as the 24th largest cryptocurrency today based on market capitalization, according to coinmarketcap.com, surpassing Zcash, the 25th cryptocurrency with a market cap of $780.431 million.\nThe Binance price began to move beyond the low single digits in mid-December, rising to $21.78 on Jan. 13, 2018, then tumbling to $7.38 on Feb. 6 before mounting the current recovery.

DEX platforms are not completely safe since their website servers are centralized, but they are much less vulnerable to large-scale thefts than conventional exchanges.\nOn March 8, the price of bitcoin dropped below $9,500 briefly, triggered in part by Binance hack rumors.\nAlmost immediately, Binance, refuted the rumors and Zhao released a statement regarding the situation, and the market recovered.\nThe Binance team stated that hackers obtained the account information of users on the Binance platform through phishing attacks throughout February. Then, with the accumulated accounts, the hackers used a false API key to execute trades on behalf of users, triggering one cryptocurrency pair to spike in volume.\nBinance reversed all trades, and no losses were recorded.\nProgress Continues\nBinance continues to make progress since it launched in a July 2017 ICO that raised approximately $15 million, and its early user base was characterized by a heavy geographic concentration in China.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

We look forward to engaging with industry leaders, participants, regulators, and legislators on this proposal.\u201d\nThe VCA would be open to all cryptoasset trading venues that serve US customers, and members would have to agree in writing to submit to certain rules governing security, fiscal management, and information sharing. Members would not be allowed to list security tokens unless they obtained securities trading licenses.\nThe Winklevoss twins have been among the industry\u2019s most vociferous voices in favor of regulation. Gemini, notably, is one of a select group of companies to be granted a BitLicense under New York\u2019s controversial cryptocurrency regulatory framework.\nAt present, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) classifies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as commodities, meaning that their cash markets are not subject to CFTC oversight unless fraud or market manipulation occurs.\nHowever, the brothers noted in their proposal that cryptoassets fill a very different role in the marketplace than oil, grain, and other commodities. They pointed to the \u201cstrong speculative interest\u201d fueling demand for cryptoassets, the relative dearth of commercial use cases, the low transaction costs associated with trading these assets, and the large number of individual investors who participate in these markets as reasons to adopt new self-regulatory standards.\nCalls for exchanges to establish a self-regulatory body intensified recently after Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released a statement warning cryptocurrency exchanges that it was a violation of federal regulations for them to list ICO tokens the agency classifies as securities.\nCFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz \u2014 who last month encouraged exchanges and other market players to embrace self-regulation and adopt standards for cybersecurity, insider trading, and ethical codes of conduct \u2013praised Gemini\u2019s proposal in a statement posted on the CFTC website.\n\u201cUltimately, a virtual commodity SRO that has the most independence from its membership, the most diversity of views, and the strongest ability to discover, reveal, and punish wrongdoing will add the most integrity to these markets. I encourage Gemini (or any other market participant, advocacy group, platform, or firm) to be aggressive in promoting these qualities within any SRO construct,\u201d he said.\nNotably, US exchanges are not the only ones considering adopting self-regulatory standards. Earlier this month, Japan\u2019s 16 licensed cryptocurrency exchanges announced that they were forming a self-regulatory body \u2014 a move that came in response to the high-profile hack of Tokyo-based exchange Coincheck, which has still yet to receive regulatory licensure.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

Bithumb is obviously one of the largest exchanges in the world,\u201d said Singh.\nFor many years, since 2014, several remittance-focused companies have attempted to utilize cryptocurrencies to process large sums of remittance payments, given the expensive fees and costs paid by both remittance senders and receivers when using existing remittance service providers like Western Union and Moneygram. \nOne disadvantage with traditional remittance companies is that in provinces or rural areas wherein remittance centers are non-existent, receivers often are required to travel far distances to receive their money, which becomes time-consuming and costly.\nSingh stated that the partnership between Bithumb and BitPay would allow users to process cross-border payments with a 1 percent fee and a guaranteed settlement time of 1 day.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it so that people can get money cheaper and quicker from suppliers internationally. So right now, someone in South Korea can pay a million-dollar invoice in the United States using Bithumb to buy bitcoin and pay the invoice, and BitPay will process that invoice and settle in US dollars the next business day,\u201d Singh explained.\nBithumb has also started to deploy cryptocurrency ATMs in South Korea, to allow any individual within the country to easily purchase and sell cryptocurrencies, also easing the process of sending remittance payments with cryptocurrencies.\nAsian Market\nWhile BitPay and Bithumb are focused on targeting the South Korea-to-US remittance market, other companies like South Korea\u2019s largest internet conglomerate Kakao are focused on serving the Asian remittance market, which is valued at $500 billion.\nLast year, Kakao, which has control over the country\u2019s messaging, fintech, taxi, and social media industries with a 90 percent market share in each industry, acquired a 40 percent stake in Satoshi Citadel Industries, the largest bitcoin-focused investment firm and remittance company in the Philippines.\nRebit.ph, a cryptocurrency-based remittance app that is operated by Satoshi Citadel, has been processing remittance payments between the Philippines and many countries in Asia. \nIn most developed countries like South Korea and the US, expat workers do not rely on remittance service providers but rather work with banks to send and receive payments. However, in countries like the Philippines and Malaysia with relatively low wage for local workers and limited access to banking services, employees utilize remittance platforms to settle payments.", "category": "Bitcoin Business"}

In an interview with Quartz on March 7, 2018, he said\n\u201cYou cannot enter every home to check what transactions are going on. So, I think this is a serious challenge, and this should not be allowed at all.\u201d\nBitcoin first caught the attention of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in late 2013, when it released a press release advising citizens against investing in cryptocurrencies. The release highlighted \u201cpotential economic, financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks\u201d. Several years later, the meteoric rise of the cryptocurrency market in November 2017 presumably motivated the central bank to issue another similar release.\nQuite notably though, Das has been a very vocal opponent of bitcoin and other digital currencies. Furthermore, while he was the secretary of economic affairs in April 2017, he also led a committee to recommend laws and regulation for cryptocurrencies in the country. A year later, another committee, headed by Subhash Garg, is now expected to submit its draft in the next few months.\nDas argued that while fiat currencies often have the backing of a country\u2019s central bank and government, there is no underlying asset base for cryptocurrencies. He added,\n\u201cThis (virtual money) is a parallel currency system developing and it is not legal. There is no legal provision which backs up these transactions.\u201d\nHe also brought up the possibility of the involvement of digital currencies in illegal activities such as money laundering and terror financing. He is not alone in expressing these concerns either. In his annual budget speech, finance minister, Arun Jaitley, stated that the government\n\u201cwill take all measures to eliminate the use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system.\u201d\nIndia is hardly the only country to have given cryptocurrencies the cold shoulder in recent times. Only last year, governments of several countries set up committees to discuss and draft a framework for the regulation of these digital assets. China, in fact, went the extremist route and banned all initial coin offerings (ICOs) from being set up within its borders. Subsequently, the Chinese government also pressurized local exchanges into submission, forcing them to pivot their business to an international audience instead.\nEven though Shaktikanta Das has little bearing on the Indian government\u2019s final stance on digital currencies, his hostility against the asset class should not be taken lightly. Given his credentials, his words could be a telling tale of the ministry\u2019s outlook towards bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

But bitcoin mining is also making headlines, amid fears that the town\u2019s power supply could be depleted.\nPlattsburgh boasts some of the cheapest energy prices in the United States because of hydroelectric power stemming from the St. Lawrence River. When the dams were formed on the river nearly 70 years ago, the town locked in low electricity rates for a fixed supply. Bitcoin miners are taking advantage of it, but the city\u2019s mayor is crying foul.\n\u201cWith great use of additional power, we are put over our threshold each winter and we are put over our threshold of ratepayers,\u201d said Mayor Colin Read.\nThis is threatening the business of mining operations such as David Bowen\u2019s Plattsburgh BTC, a 20-computer business housed in an old paper warehouse. Bowen recognized the opportunity in the town back in 2014 and has been mining bitcoin ever since. Good news traveled fast, and since that time a handful of other bitcoin miners have become his neighbors.\nBut now their fate hangs in the balance.\u00a0According to reports, bitcoin mining consumers about 10% of Plattsburgh power generation.

The SEC has since seen the drafts of its ICO regulatory framework released for public consultation, twice extended, complete its final round on January 22, the report revealed.\nThe idea has gained support from a former Thai finance minister and current FinTech proponent Korn Chatikavanij. Serving as Thailand\u2019s finance minister from 2008 to 2011, Korn has previously been recognized as the \u2018Global Finance Minister of the Year\u2019 \u00a0in 2010 after charting a course for the economy through the global financial crisis at the time. The Democrat Party politician now sees a role as chairman of the Thai FinTech Association, a Bangkok-based startup accelerator that also serves as a testing lab for FinTech startups looking to carve an entry into the domestic market.\nIn an interview last week, the chairman spoke of discussions between the body and Thailand\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Bank of Thailand (the central bank) and the Finance Ministry with a focus on regulation for the cryptocurrency sector brought on by the SEC.\nSpeaking to the Bangkok Post, Korn reveals a concentrated effort to have the SEC, not the financial ministry or the central bank, be the sole authority responsible for introducing regulation for the sector.\n\u201cI agree with the Finance Ministry\u2019s [view] of letting the SEC be the only organisation governing digital assets, because it already oversees securities and has a profound understanding of digital assets,\u201d Korn said.\nThe former finance minister added:\n\u201cDigital assets are new for everyone, and no one knows everything [about them], so all parties should be open-minded, learn about them and have proper rules and regulations.\u201d\nSo far, market participants have gotten on-board with the SEC\u2019s floated mandatory \u201cinvestment participation\u201d requirement wherein ICO operators must have the offering originate in Thailand with capital of up to 5 million baht (approx. $160,000) registered as the minimum.", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

Led by bitcoin, many major cryptocurrencies have recorded large gains since March 11.\nBitcoin Up 14%\nBitcoin, the most dominant cryptocurrency in the market, has recorded a gain of over 14 percent since yesterday, rising from $8,400 to $9,800. On both cryptocurrency-only exchanges like Binance and cryptocurrency-to-fiat exchanges like Bitfinex, bitcoin demonstrated strong volumes, despite its struggles last week, amidst the Mt. Gox bitcoin sell off.\n\nThe rise in the price of bitcoin and the momentum it has started to build over the past few days are likely triggered by optimistic developments within the cryptocurrency industry, and a prolonged recovery from the long-lasting correction since January.\nMajor businesses in South Korea including the country\u2019s largest hotel booking platform Yeogi Eottae and leading e-commerce platform WeMakePrice have began integrating cryptocurrencies in collaboration with Bithumb, the biggest cryptocurrency trading platform in South Korea.\nWhile it may require several months for the two influential businesses to start accepting cryptocurrencies, Bithumb spokesperson stated that the integration of cryptocurrencies by the two companies will lead to other major businesses in the country accepting cryptocurrencies in the near future.\nAlready, Kakao, the largest internet conglomerate in South Korea that operates KakaoTalk, KakaoPay, KakaoTaxi, KakaoStory, Dunamoo (UpBit), and many other subsidiaries that remain in dominant control over their respective industries and markets, have initiated the integration process of cryptocurrencies.\nAs CCN reported, the integration of cryptocurrencies by Kakao will allow 12,000 merchants using KakaoPay to accept cryptocurrencies with ease, millions of users on KakaoTaxi, KakaoPay, and potentially KakaoTalk, to send and receive cryptocurrencies, and tens of millions of consumers to utilize cryptocurrencies as a payment method.\nPreviously, Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz stated that in order for cryptocurrencies to \u201csurvive,\u201d retailers will need to adopt them as a means of payment. Schultz said:\n\u201cI personally believe that there is going to be a one or a few legitimate trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology.

Some argue that the price of bitcoin could spike to $12,000 and initiate a strong rally towards its previous levels, while other investors argue that bitcoin would require more time to recover fully from its correction.\nBut, it is evident that the market is leading towards bitcoin in a highly volatile period like this, as newcomers enter the market.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

While not exactly a return of the \u201ckimchi premium,\u201d this indicates that demand among Korean investors remains strong despite the introduction of regulatory measures meant to cool off the markets.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nBitcoin Recovers from Mt. Gox Panic\nLast week\u2019s Bitcoin price dive correlated with a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of bearish factors.\nAs CCN reported, US regulators took several shots at initial coin offerings (ICOs). The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warned cryptocurrency exchanges that it is \u201cunlawful\u201d for them to list ICO tokens the SEC deems to be securities. Meanwhile, a newly-released Treasury Department letter suggested that ICO operators may have to comply with bank-grade reporting requirements and anti-money laundering regulations. Though targeted specifically at ICOs, these developments injected a bearish sentiment into the wider cryptocurrency markets.\nMoreover, news broke that the Mt. Gox trustee had liquidated more than $400 million worth of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash on cryptocurrency exchanges over the previous several months. While it is debatable to what extent this sale had a meaningful effect on the Bitcoin price during the recent market correction,\u00a0 the fact that the trustee continues to hold nearly $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency \u2014 and has demonstrated a willingness to sell on exchanges, rather than through the over-the-counter (OTC) services typically exercised by large-scale buyers and sellers \u2014 further worsened the mood among investors.\nHowever, it appears that traders oversold these developments, as the Bitcoin price has once again proved buoyant in the face of adversity.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

It is unclear whether any of stolen funds have already been cashed out.\nThe identity of the hackers also remains a mystery, although previous reports have said that the attack bore similarities to cyber attacks that have been linked to North Korean state-sponsored hackers.\nJapanese financial regulators have ramped up their oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges in response to the hack, and the country\u2019s licensed trading platforms have announced that they will form a self-regulatory body that, if approved by the government, will have enforcement power over its members.\nAs CCN reported, Coincheck intends to resume trading this week following a government-mandated overhaul of its security systems.\nThe exchange will also begin compensating the estimated 260,000 customers who lost funds as the result of the hack. Notably, users will be compensated in fiat at a rate of nearly 89 JPY (~$0.83) per token, which is more than double the present XEM/JPY exchange rate.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

While two-thirds of all mining takes place in China, according to some estimates, some amount of mining takes place in other places.\nThere is currently no legal basis to prevent or limit energy consumed within the EU, the statement noted. But given that electrical consumption is an economic activity, it is subject to EU rules that apply to energy efficiency, the power sector and greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions in the power sector are covered by the EU emission trading system.\nThe cryptocurrency mining business model is based on delivering a high valuation of cryptocurrencies, the statement noted. The increasing electricity consumption and cost is likely to modify the value of and demand for cryptocurrencies.\nMining Is Legal\nThe Commission has not invoked any way to track cryptocurrency mining because it is not an illegal activity. However, the Commission will review the activity as it impacts the demand for energy.\nIt is important to keep in mind that many promising applications of blockchain technology do not have extensive need for processing power, Gabriel\u2019s statement further noted.\nIn January, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde told the World Economic Forum that bitcoin mining is too energy intensive. Many analysts and environmentalists have sounded the alarm on the industry\u2019s power usage, and Lagarde said that it has turned in to a \u201cbig concern\u201d given that the world is already battle climate change.\nAlso read:\u00a0IMF\u2019s Lagarde says that bitcoin mining consumes too much electricity\nEU Explores Blockchain\nThe European Commission announced plans last year to establish an EU Blockchain Observatory in response to a European Parliament mandate to strengthen technical expertise and regulatory capacity.

Also, the integrity of the financial system must be guaranteed, as well as the integrity of the technologies supporting cryptocurrencies, such as cryptography and distributed ledger.\nThe European nations have recognized the risk of cryptocurrencies as the deposits are not guaranteed. There are also concerns about cryptocurrency being used for illegal purposes, such as money laundering.\nCurrent regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrency are insufficient, he said. As a result, Germany, France and the European Commission have called for discussion. The Netherlands, he said, should play a pioneering role.\nCryptocurrencies, due to no central authority, are inherently cross-border currencies, Hoekstra noted. In addition, national regulations can be hard to enforce. Hence, he believes international measures are necessary.\nAction Planned\nHoekstra will be part of the Financial Action Task Force, an international, intergovernmental which focuses on tackling money laundering and countering the financing crime and terrorism.\nAnti-money laundering rules that apply to banks and other financial institutions also apply to exchange platforms for cryptocurrencies and providers of digital storage vouchers.\nThis means that the customer due diligence obligations, including the identity of the client, must be determined. In addition, financial institutions must register, comply with reliability and suitability requirements and report unusual transactions to the national Financial Intelligence Unit.\nAs for government agencies investing in cryptocurrencies, Hoekstra said the guidelines for investing in cryptocurrencies by local authorities are established in the Local Government Funding Act and other regulations.\nHe said he will dedicate himself to a European approach to regulating ICOs, which he noted can be used to finance new products, but are speculative in nature.\nAlso read: French, German finance officials call for global crackdown on cryptocurrency\nDerivatives Call\u00a0 For Action\nHe will also seek an approach to address derivative products such as futures and binary options.\nRegarding derivatives, it has been possible to trade in bitcoin derivatives since Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Options Exchange introduced bitcoin futures.\nBinary options are also derivative products that can be used to speculate on the future value or event of an underlying instrument, which can be a cryptocurrency.\nThe AFM, the Dutch authority for financial markets, and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) have expressed reservations about the sale of derivative products including binary options to non-professional investors, given the risks involved. Hoekstra thinks it\u2019s important that the regulators address the sale of these products to non-professional investors, especially those involving cryptocurrencies.\nHe said he will support rapid action in the Netherlands in respect to the sale of risky derivative products (including on cryptocurrencies) to draw the attention of European supervisors.\nHe will also support giving the AFM the power to issue advertising statements regarding risky financial products such as binary options to consumers.\nHoekstra said he hopes for legislation and regulations can become effective at the end of 2019.", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

Alongside this, the bank reminds customers that digital currencies are not legal tender, and urged investors to exercise caution and carefully examine the potential risks.\nCoinzer\u2019s proposed digital token, which uses the official BNM logo.\nSince the Bank\u2019s statement, Coinzer has produced their own press release, posted on their website. The statement attempts to clarify that the physical token was only a proposal and that they will now not be going ahead with this idea. They add that they are in fact working closely with Malaysian authorities and that the development of cryptocurrencies is recognized as a positive force by both sides:\n\u00a0\u201cRegulators in many countries especially Malaysia are aware that this new technology and financial innovation will not only enhance productivity of economic activities, but also make financial intermediation more seamless\u201d\nAccording to the website, a new design and a video further explaining the situation are in production.\nCoinzer is building on the Ethereum network, focused on maximizing the efficiency of businesses by bringing all manner of systems on to the blockchain.\u00a0 Their whitepaper states that they are trying to become the number one cryptocurrency in Malaysia and attract international investments to the Asian country.\nMalaysia itself has taken a passive stance towards cryptocurrencies, with the head of the central bank announcing that the public would decide the technology\u2019s future last month.\u00a0\u201cIt is not the intention of the authorities to ban or put a stop on any innovation that is perceived to be beneficial to the public,\u201d he told reporters. It marks Malaysia as one of the few countries that has laid out a clear approach to the development of virtual currencies, allowing the public to decide their fate.\nWhilst the central bank\u2019s position has been for the most part positive towards crypto,\u00a0Malaysia\u2019s statutory securities regulator did shut down an ICO in January.

Gox trustee.\nBinance Hack Rumors Refuted\nFrom over $10,600, the price of bitcoin dropped by more than $1,100 within a span of several hours, reaching $9,400. However, almost immediately after the development team of Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, refuted hack rumors and Changpeng Zhao, the CEO at Binance, released a statement regarding the situation, the market recovered.\nWithin 10 hours, the price of bitcoin declined from $10,600 to $9,400, and rebounded back to $10,000. The entire cryptocurrency market was extremely volatile during this period, as most major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Ripple followed the price movement of bitcoin.\n\nIn an official statement, the Binance team stated that hackers obtained the account information of users on the Binance platform through phishing attacks throughout February. Then, with the accumulated accounts, the hackers used a false API key to execute trades on behalf of users, triggering one cryptocurrency pair to spike in volume.\n\u201cYesterday, within the aforementioned 2 minute period, the hackers used the API keys, placed a large number of market buys on the VIA/BTC market, pushing the price high, while 31 pre-deposited accounts were there selling VIA at the top. This was an attempt to move the BTC from the phished accounts to the 31 accounts. Withdrawal requests were then attempted from these accounts immediately afterwards,\u201d wrote the Binance team.\nBinance has since reversed all trades, and no losses were recorded. Strangely, only the hackers that attempted to take advantage of Binance users had their funds lost, as Changpeng Zhao noted. \nJapanese Exchanges\nSeveral analysts have attributed the recent minor correction of the cryptocurrency market to the penalization of Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges for having poor security measures and breaching Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies. \nTokyo-based technology reporter Yuji Nakamura revealed that two small-scale cryptocurrency exchanges have been shut down (FSHO and BitStation), four major trading platforms in GMO, Zaif, Bicrements, and Mr. Exchange were penalized, and two licenses were taken away.\nLast month, the South Korean government imposed a penalty on cryptocurrency exchanges with poor security measures, as a part of a larger initiative to allow the cryptocurrency market to evolve and grow within a robust ecosystem, protecting investors.\nBut, the community has had an outsized reaction towards the crackdown on small cryptocurrency exchanges by the Japanese government. \nAfter the CoinCheck $530 million security breach, the Japanese government received many complaints from investors, despite the fact that CoinCheck has decided to refund all users who have lost their funds during the hacking attack.\nThe recent brief correction was caused by a combination of four factors: Japan\u2019s crackdown on small exchanges, Binance hack rumors, SEC\u2019s announcement to exchanges, and major cryptocurrencies failing to meet key resistance levels.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

Lee has not changed his midyear price target of $20,000 and his end year price target of $25,000 for bitcoin.\nLee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC\u2019s \u201cFast Money\u201d Friday that when the bitcoin misery index falls below 27, bitcoin sees its best 12-month performance. Such a signal comes about every year, the strategist said.\nLowest Index Since September 2011\nThe index now stands at 18.8 on a scale of 100, making its lowest point since Sept. 6, 2011.\nLee said the index offers a way to measure how happy or said you are owning bitcoin.\nThe index is intended as a contrarian indicator. When it is low, investors should buy. When it is high, they should sell. The index accounts for the number of winning trades from the total trades. It also accounts for volatility.\nAt the end of last week, bitcoin\u2019s price fell 24 percent from its Monday high following reports about rising regulatory scrutiny.\nThe low points signify pain, even though they are short-term signals. Long-term, Lee said the low points could point to a great entry way into bitcoin.\nWhat Past Patterns Foretell\nThe last four times the index fell below 27 on the bitcoin misery index, bitcoin never failed to rise 12 months later, Lee said.\nLast week was a tough one for bitcoin. A major Hong Kong exchange reported on Wednesday that some accounts might have been compromised. At the same time, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission increased its scrutiny of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges. On Thursday, Japan suspended two cryptocurrency exchanges from operating for a month and called for business improvements at five other exchanges.\nIt was also reported Wednesday that the trustee of the now defunct Mt. Gox exchange sold about $400 million worth of bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\nBitcoin traded more than 3.5 percent lower Friday morning, around $8,900. While it remains more than 800 percent higher than where it was a year ago, it has lost more than 50 percent from its record high of more than $19,000 in mid-December.\nLee said it is very uncommon to be this unhappy owning bitcoin. The last such periods were November of 2012, September of 2016 and January of 2015.\nIn each case, bitcoin was higher in the following month.\nAlso read: Strategist Tom Lee predicts new all-time highs for bitcoin in July\nLee: Hold On One To Three Weeks\nLee said the index is telling people to wait it out for the next one or two or three weeks.\nHe is the only major Wall Street strategist to issue regular bitcoin reports and formal price targets. Prior to co-founding Fundstrat, he was chief equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Chase.\nLee maintained his midyear price target of $20,000 and his end year price target of $25,000 for bitcoin.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

I received my invitation the next day, at which time Google Play indicated that roughly 100 users had downloaded the Android version of the app.\nCircle Invest provides retail investors with access to Circle Trade, the company\u2019s institutional trading desk. The platform does not charge commission, instead skimming its revenue from the spread between the buy and sell price, which Circle says will average one percent depending on market conditions.\nThe app has a simple interface that features overall portfolio tracking as well as modules for each individual cryptocurrency.\nSource: Circle Invest\nAt present, the app supports Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Notably absent is Ripple\u2019s XRP token, which is featured in images advertising Circle Invest but is not currently available in the app\u2019s beta version.\nCircle advertises that users will have instant access to their funds (up to $10,000 per week), and they can invest with as little as $1. However, users who abuse the system by making purchases with insufficient funds in their linked bank accounts will lose the ability to make instant buys.\nUsers are unable to make cryptocurrency deposits during this phase of the beta, but the company says deposits will be added in the future. The app is also currently only available to US customers, though several states are excluded due to their money transmitter regulations.\nUnfortunately, I was unable to test the app\u2019s core functionality, as a bug caused the app to crash when I attempted to register an account. This may be because my mobile device is several generations old, but in any case, I expect it to be addressed in a later update.\nCircle has not yet revealed a specific target date for the app\u2019s production release, but it has said in the past it expects Circle Invest to go live in 2018. When it does, it will join a growing list of competitors to Coinbase, the dominant force in the US cryptocurrency brokerage market.\nAs CCN reported, fintech darlings Square and Robinhood have recently begun adding support for cryptocurrency trading. Square Cash\u2019s US customers can buy and sell Bitcoin through its mobile app, while Robinhood has rolled out Bitcoin and Ethereum trading to users in five states.\nHowever, of the three, Circle Invest is the app which most closely mirrors Coinbase eponymous brokerage app, and \u2014 owing to its former life as a Bitcoin exchange,\u00a0 its profitable trading desk, and its recent acquisition of cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex \u2014 it is also the firm with the deepest roots in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.", "category": "Bitcoin Companies"}

Expert estimates on the cryptocurrency\u2019s use in these activities vary. As reported by CCN, a 2016 Europol report found no evidence of terrorists using bitcoin.\nMoreover, a report from the European Commission to the European Parliament and Council found that terrorists and criminals are barely using bitcoin or ethereum. The report labeled the risk of digital currencies being used to finance terrorism as \u201cmoderately significant.\u201d\nNevertheless, according to Rogoff, government regulations would be a trigger for bitcoin\u2019s demise. The economist stressed that developing a global framework of regulations would take time. He noted:\n\u201cIt really needs to be global regulation. Even if the U.S. cracks down on it and China cracks down, but Japan doesn\u2019t, people will be able to still launder money through Japan.\u201d\nThroughout the world, individual countries are creating their own regulations for cryptocurrencies. Last year, Japan legalized the flagship cryptocurrency as a payment method.\nMexico\u2019s congress has also approved cryptocurrency and crowdfunding regulations, that just need the president\u2019s signature to become law. Similarly, the Philippines\u2019 primary securities regulator has confirmed it will work toward crafting regulations for cryptocurrency transactions and initial coin offerings (ICOs).\nAccording to Rogoff, authorities have been slow to regulate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because they anticipate developments in the technology behind cryptocurrencies. Per his words, regulators want to see the technology develop,\u201d as the private sector has historically \u201cinvented everything\u201d when it comes to currency.\nNotably, this isn\u2019t the first time Rogoff takes a bearish approach to bitcoin. Back in October, the former chief economist at the IMF argued bitcoin\u2019s price will collapse in the long run, as \u201cthe long history of currency tells us that what the private sector innovates, the state eventually regulates and appropriates.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Opinion"}

Two exchanges, FSHO and Bit Station, are hit the hardest with month-long business suspension orders effective today.\nOver the course of its inspections, the FSA discovered that a BitStation senior staff member had \u2018diverted\u2019 customers\u2019 bitcoins for personal use, the Nikkei reports. There were repeated cases of high-value cryptocurrency trades with no judgment made about the need for notification of a suspicious transaction,\u201d the FSA said of Yokohama-based FSHO.\nFive other exchanges \u2013 Tech Bureau, GMO Coin, Bicrements, Mr. Exchange and Coincheck, the Tokyo-based exchange that lost $530 million in stolen NEM this year \u2013 have all been hit with business improvement orders by the FSA. All seven exchanges have been scrutinized for lacking proper internal control systems and underwhelming security measures. Two of the seven exchanges, Tech Bureau and GMO Coin, are notably registered with the FSA and are licensed to operate an exchange in Japan.\nFollowing an onsite inspection of internet conglomerate GMO\u2019s cryptocurrency exchange the regulator accused the operator of failing to investigate a number of system faults and subsequent measures to prevent them from occurring again.\nThe FSA began inspecting exchanges soon after the Coincheck hack in late January and the regulator determined that the exchange lacked measures to combat money laundering, demanding that the Tokyo-based operator ensure a reliable and secure business operation that safeguards consumer assets. Acknowledging its second such notice today, Coincheck said it will comply with a mandate to submit its improvement plan by March 22.\nAfter completing its first round of inspections, the FSA reportedly fears a repeat of a Coincheck-style hack after discovering a multitude of concerns in customer protection and anti-money-laundering measures. While initially focusing on oversight into transactions and systems management, the FSA is now forcing exchanges to address a broader range of issues including corporate governance and management structure.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

Many platforms refer to themselves as \u201cexchanges,\u201d which can give the misimpression to investors that they are regulated or meet the regulatory standards of a national securities exchange.\u201d\nIn response to the market\u2019s reaction to the announcement of the SEC which led the value of most cryptocurrencies to fall by large margins, Garlinghouse noted that cryptocurrency exchanges have the option to de-list ICO tokens or simply register with the agency, and that the SEC\u2019s regulation does not hugely impact cryptocurrency trading platforms in a negative manner.\n\u201cMore My POV on the SEC statement today \u2013 the market is having an outsized reaction. Exchanges ultimately have three options ahead of them: de-list ICOs, register, or close. Certainly big implications for ETH given ERC20 tokens,\u201d said Garlinghouse.\nDid SEC Cause the Recent Correction?\nThe recent market correction that led the price of bitcoin to drop to $9,000 and other major cryptocurrencies to experience a drastic fall in value was caused by three major factors: massive sell-off of bitcoin by the Mt. Gox trustee, the SEC announcement, and the Japanese government\u2019s penalization of local trading platforms.\nHence, it is highly unlikely that the announcement of the SEC solely caused the market to drop by more than $70 billion overnight. On March 6, the valuation of the cryptocurrency market reached $470 billion. As of March 8, the valuation of the cryptocurrency market remains below $380 billion.\nAs Garlinghouse emphasized, the SEC\u2019s decision to require exchanges to register with the agency for listing ERC20 tokens or ICOs only impacts tokens launched on top of the Ethereum network that are considered as securities by the SEC.\nOn February 6, in a senate hearing, SEC chairman Jay Clayton noted that there exists a clear difference between ICO tokens and cryptocurrencies. Clayton explained that while ICOs are securities, others are \u201ctrue cryptocurrencies.\u201d\nGiven that most cryptocurrency exchanges are already well regulated and registered with both federal and state government agencies, it is unlikely that the recent announcement of the SEC will have a major impact on the market in the mid-term.", "category": "News"}

Analysts have attributed three major factors to the decline in the price of bitcoin: Mt. Gox sell off, SEC announcement, penalization of Japanese exchanges.\nMt. Gox Trustee Sell-Off\nAccording to the official document released by the Mt. Gox trustee, a total of $404 million worth of bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash have been sold over the past few months, at a price determined by the trustee, which is significantly lower than the current market value of bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\n\u201cAs a result of the consultation with the court, I considered it necessary and reasonable to sell a certain amount of BTC and BCC at this point and secure a certain amount of money for distribution resources, and thus, I sold the amount of BTC and BCC above. I made efforts to sell BTC and BCC at as high a price as possible in light of the market price of BTC and BCC at the timing of sale. I plan to consult with the court and determine further sale of BTC and BCC,\u201d the document read.\nIn the next few months, the trustee intends to liquidate the remaining assets, which are 166,344.35827254 bitcoins, worth around $1.7 billion based on the current value of bitcoin.\nIt is likely that the planned sell-off of over a billion dollars worth of bitcoin has caused a domino effect on many cryptocurrency exchanges, leading to the decline in the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a consequence. \nSEC\u2019s Announcement\nThis week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that cryptocurrency exchanges that have listed initial coin offerings (ICOs) or tokens on their platforms are required to register with the agency in order to continue providing support for ERC20 tokens.\nAs CCN reported, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that the market overreacted to the announcement of the SEC, given that cryptocurrency exchanges have simple options to comply with the SEC: de-list ICO tokens or register with the agency.\nGarlinghouse added that there exists no uncertainty regarding the announcement of the SEC, as he noted:\nIn context of yesterday\u2019s SEC statement(s), I hear some in crypto talk about the current \u2018regulatory uncertainty.\u2019 What\u2019s uncertain?

Christopher Giancarlo said Wednesday.\nGiancarlo revealed this international effort during a U.S. House of Representatives committee hearing on the CFTC\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2019, adding that officials in the Treasury Department and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were also involved in the collaboration.\n\u201cThe CFTC has been in close communication with the SEC with respect to policy and jurisdictional considerations, and in connection with our recent enforcement cases,\u201d he testified, according to a transcript of his statement, which was published online by Mondo Visione. \u201cWe have also been working with the U.S. Treasury and the FSOC.

This prediction seems to have at least partially shown some validity with statements coming out of the CBOE\u00a0Risk Management Conference\u00a0on Friday which featured a fireside chat with Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. In the fireside chat, Cameron and Tyler said that the CBOE is interested in expanding to more cryptocurrencies. The only reason they haven\u2019t yet is actually Gemini\u2019s lack of support for coins other than Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nThis is significant because it means that CBOE fully intends to issue futures on other cryptocurrencies. The hold-up, it would appear, is Gemini itself. At the moment Gemini only offers Bitcoin\u00a0and Ethereum. This is a problem since CBOE has an exclusive deal with Gemini that it will only use Gemini to calculate it\u2019s futures. Therefore, in order for the CBOE to add more coins, Gemini also needs to add more coins. This also means that Ethereum, which is already offered on Gemini, is likely to come to the CBOE future markets very soon.\nWhat is the CBOE?\nThe CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange) is a futures market that was among the first to get the go-ahead\u00a0to offer futures on Bitcoin. Like any other futures, these need a data source to track. In this case, that data source was the prices on the\u00a0Gemini Exchange\u00a0founded by the\u00a0billionaire\u00a0famous (or infamous, if you\u2019re a fan of The Social Network) Winklevoss Twins.\nThe Winklevoss Twins at the CBOE Risk Management Conference\nThe partnership has received criticism in the past for several reasons. Aside from the lack of diversity in the coins offered on the exchange, the most prominent concern is the trading volume. The futures markets are entirely based on the performance of Bitcoin on the Winklevosses trading platform and low trading volume makes the platform easy to manipulate for relatively little cash. For reference, as this article is being written CoinMarketCap\u00a0has Bitcoin\u00a0at\u00a0$9,346.50 while Gemini has Bitcoin at\u00a0$9,224.71. These price differences are not insignificant: especially on trades involving millions of dollars. Market manipulations\u00a0exploiting the low trading volume of Gemini have been an ongoing concern and the addition of more coins has the potential to exacerbate the problem by diluting the trading volume of individual coins.\nWhat comes next?\nIn line with my last article, it\u2019s reasonable to assume Ethereum will be the next cryptocurrency to have a CBOE derivative. It\u2019s #2 on CoinMarketCap\u00a0and the only other cryptocurrency that is trading on Gemini at the moment. I\u2019d be surprised if nothing was announced in the next month.\nAt the same time, we can expect to see more coins being added to Gemini. Considering the Winklevosses comments on pressure from the CBOE to add more coins, we can only assume that new coins added on Gemini will be next in line for the CBOE.\nHow will this affect the crypto markets?\nIf the past is any indication, the introduction of new futures will cause a price boom. When the addition of Bitcoin was announced on the CBOE markets the price soared 13%. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if we saw Ethereums price boost on news of it\u2019s addition to the CBOE markets.\nAdditionally, I anticipate huge price boosts for any lower market cap currencies added to Gemini. As it\u2019s logical that most traders will reach the same conclusion we did and predict that any coin added to Gemini is something the CBOE pushed for, given the two companies special relationship. The futures markets have seemed to do two things so far. First of all, they seem to have stabilized the price of Bitcoin (although whether or not this constitutes causation or correlation is very much up for debate). They have also legitimized the currencies in the eyes of many Wall Street traders now engaged in the Bitcoin futures markets.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

The entire market followed bitcoin\u2019s price trend, as the three largest cryptocurrencies behind bitcoin in Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Ripple all declined by 11 percent, by the same exact margin as bitcoin.\n\nAnalysts like WhalePanda have attributed to the recent fall to the massive sell off of bitcoin by the Mt. Gox trustee, and the controversial decision of the trustee to sell 40,000 bitcoin on a cryptocurrency exchange, rather than over-the-counter (OTC) platforms.\n\u201cMtGox was terrible and the incompetent way they are handling is terrible, saying that Bitcoin has been crashing since all-time high because of it is just silly. It\u2019s only\u2019 40,000 BTC. It is about the same as claiming that Tether caused the run to $20k. People love their narratives though,\u201d said WhalePanda.\nHowever, the sale of 40,000 bitcoin is not the end of the Mt. Gox trustee\u2019s sell off of bitcoin. According to the official document released by the Mt. Gox trustee, more than $1.7 billion worth of bitcoin is expected to be sold in the next few months.\nThe official document of the Mt. Gox trustee referring to Bitcoin Cash as BCC read:\n\u201cAs a result of the consultation with the court, I considered it necessary and reasonable to sell a certain amount of BTC and BCC at this point and secure a certain amount of money for distribution resources, and thus, I sold the amount of BTC and BCC above. I made efforts to sell BTC and BCC at as high a price as possible in light of the market price of BTC and BCC at the timing of sale. I plan to consult with the court and determine further sale of BTC and BCC.\u201d\n$1.7 Billion\nIf the Mt. Gox trustee continues to dump large amounts of bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges rather than in the OTC market wherein big buyers can trade with each other, the price of bitcoin will continue to be affected by the sale.\nEthereum co-founder and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson stated that bitcoin may have been overvalued at $19,000 if a short-term sell off by a single entity could lead the price of the cryptocurrency to fall by a margin like this, emphasizing the liquidity problem in the cryptocurrency market.\n\u201cWas bitcoin really worth $20,000 a coin if an event like this has such a profound impact on the market? We need an index of how much the market can afford to liquidate without crashing for each cryptocurrency; call it the \u0394L metric,\u201d said Hoskinson.\nIt remains unclear whether the Mt. Gox trustee will dump over a billion dollars worth of bitcoin on exchanges as planned, or move to OTC market to prevent market manipulation.", "category": "Bitcoin Analysis"}

The grants, announced on an Ethereum blog, are designed to support developers with R&D, experience and education.\nThe foundation views the grants as a signal to the community of its need to find the missing pieces of the Ethereum ecosystem that need more support.\nThe foundation plans to increase its efforts to support the community to make Ethereum scalable, useful and secure. While the grant program was announced as a strictly scalability focused program two months ago, it decided to broaden the support to projects also addressing usefulness and security.\nTeams that win a grant receive non-dilutive funding, technical advice, connections to more users and a platform to share their work on.\nWhy Funding Is Needed\nScalability, usefulness and security projects have no ICOs or token sales, but simply focus on building useful products and experiences.\nScalability can take the form of deploying sharding, plasma or state channels. It can also take the form of optimizing geth/parity or building alternate clients.\nUsefulness takes the form of improving the developer experience or experimenting with new dapps that offer utility to the end user. Improving the developer experience can include static analyzers, linters, development frameworks, mobile SKDs, documentation or Solidity/Vyper development.\nSecurity can take the form of auditing existing contracts to creating tools to eliminate error prone programming patterns to developing alternative second layer languages focusing on security.\nNew Focus: Design\nThe foundation is also starting to engage the design community to address product and UX design problems. Areas in need of improvement for mainstream adoption include key management, Ethereum payments, UX and onboarding flows. The foundation wants to fund design studies and hire designers to connect with teams.\nThe Ethereum project began with open source developers contributing to the project in their spare time. This has led to a \u201chackternship\u201d grant for members who propose an impactful side project.\nThe grants are as follows:\n\nL4 Research \u2013 Scalability Grant \u2013 $1.5M. State channels research.\nRuntime Verification \u2013 Security Grant \u2013 $500K. Casper contract formal verification.\nETHGlobal \u2013 DevEx Grant \u2013 $200K.

In contrast, bitcoin fell by 2.5 percent, Ether by 5 percent, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash by 3 percent, and Litecoin by 4 percent.\nOn a weekly basis, Monero is also one of the few cryptocurrencies to demonstrate a surge in price. On March 1, the price of Monero was $285. As of March 7, the price of Monero remains above $360, recording a 26 percent weekly increase in price.\n\nThe rise in demand for Monero can be attributed to the increase in interest towards privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. Amongst many cryptocurrencies with privacy features, Monero remains as the only private digital currency that anonymizes every transaction on the blockchain network. Hence, unlike other cryptocurrencies, transactions processed on the Monero network cannot be traced.\n\u201cAll Monero transactions require full mandatory privacy unlike the mentioned coins. In all other private crypto currencies so far privacy is optional and hardly used, since it\u2019s complicated and/or isn\u2019t supported by wallets. Zcash has not even 400 fully shielded transactions a month, Dash uses CoinJoin mixing over Masternodes where you have to wait for partners to mix with and it takes hours. PivX does exactly the same like Dash, but it\u2019s even smaller and you have less partners to mix with,\u201d the Monero team explained in an interview with cryptocurrency analyst CryptoRand.\nAs governments like the US and South Korea continue to crackdown on cryptocurrency account holders for tax purposes, it is likely that the demand for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies will continue to increase. As for Monero, given that it remains as one of the few cryptocurrencies to sustain momentum throughout the past week, it will be able to prolong its rally in the short-term.\nBitcoin and Ethereum\nWhile bitcoin has fallen by 2.5 percent, other alternative cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Cardano have fallen by more than 5 percent. In fact, over the past two weeks, bitcoin has continued to outperform most major cryptocurrencies in the market. \nThe dominance index of bitcoin has reached a new yearly high\u2013from January to March\u2013at 42 percent, which dropped to 31 percent in December 2017.\nFrom its all-time high, bitcoin is down 43 percent. Meanwhile, Ethereum is down 43.6 percent from its all-time high at $1,400. Until February, Ethereum has followed the price trend of bitcoin. As bitcoin cross the $8,000 mark, Ether surpassed $800 and as bitcoin surpassed $9,000, Ether peaked at $900. But, over the past two weeks, Ethereum has struggled to sustain its momentum.\nIn this recovery period, it is more likely that bitcoin will outperform alternative cryptocurrencies in the short-term, as holders of other cryptocurrencies move to bitcoin and newcomers invest in bitcoin first, before moving to other assets.", "category": "Altcoin Analysis"}

They are offerings of interest in an enterprise where the buyer of the ICO of the token, you can call it a token you can call it a security, is basically saying I\u2019m investing with you with the promise of a future return, whether you deliver something to me in the future as a result of your efforts or because I sell it to somebody else who wants that return in the future. That\u2019s a security, and the SEC\u2019s job is to regulate the offer and sale of securities.\u201d\nThese are among the SEC chairman\u2019s first public statements on this nascent fundraising model since reports emerged that the agency had issued subpoenas to as many as 80 ICO operators, demanding that they turn over documents related to their token sales.\nThe SEC is also investigating other offerings \u2014 including that of tZero, a subsidiary of e-commerce company Overstock \u2014 although these companies have reportedly been asked to hand over documents voluntarily.\nIn a lengthy exchange, Clayton detailed one of the SEC\u2019s chief problems with the state of the ICO markets, namely that issuers appear determined to \u201cbreak down [the] traditional approach to public and private markets.\u201d He explained that under SEC guidelines, securities issuers may choose to either conduct their offering as a private placement or as a public offering. Most ICOs, he said, have tried to do both.\n\u201cFor some reason, people selling ICOs seem to think they don\u2019t need to follow either path they seem to think they can have the best of both worlds. A limited disclosure from a private placement and public trading and public offering of the token. For a long time, since 1933 that\u2019s not been allowed,\u201d Clayton said. \u201cAlthough I love this new technology the new technology is not a reason to break down our traditional approach to public and private markets.\u201d\nMeanwhile, a newly-released letter drafted by an official with the Department of the Treasury suggests that ICOs may also have to register as money transfer businesses, which would subject them to the Bank Secrecy Act and other regulations that, if violated, incur criminal penalties.\nClayton advised investors to \u201cthink long and hard\u201d before contributing to ICOs that do not explicitly demonstrate their compliance with SEC regulations, noting that there is little the agency can do to protect investors once the money moves offshore.\nBut for ICO operators, he had a more explicit admonition:\n\u201cAbide by the law,\u201d he warned, \u201cwe are watching, others are watching.\u201d", "category": "ICO News"}

By June, the rate had surged to 2,640 bolivars per USD.\nIn September, the platform was temporarily shut down, due to a lack of foreign currency supply. It was then reopened at a rate of 3,345 bolivars per USD. Earlier this year, the rate skyrocketed to 25,000 bolivars per USD, while on the black market one USD costs 228,000 bolivars.\nThe platform allows users to participate in the system, after they register on it and hold an account denominated in foreign currency, at a bank authorized to operate in Venezuela.

Hydro-Quebec, the Montreal, Canada-based utility, warned last week that cheap power would not be available to every company expanding to the province, hinting the company could set a higher tariff on cryptocurrency miners.\nCouillard questioned the industry\u2019s contribution to the local economy, Bloomberg Technology\u00a0reports. Speaking at a conference in Montreal, he said companies must provide an added value for society, and simply having servers doing mining to create bitcoins does not accomplish this.\nBitcoin No, Blockchain Yes\nThe shrug does not extend to blockchain technology, however, as Couillard said he is more supportive of companies that will create a \u201creal eco-system or a real technological transformation centered on blockchain.\u201d He said he is open to such companies even if they use cryptocurrency to finance their investment.\nHydro-Quebec had indicated it may consider hiking the cost for bitcoin miners given a flood of pent-up demand in the region, which would thwart the plans of bitcoin miners who depend on low rates for the massive amounts of electricity it requires to power their operations.\nQuebec had previously been courting cryptocurrency companies with its low cost, renewable energy, which resulted in an avalanche of requests to supply electricity to cryptocurrency miners looking to set up shop there, creating a demand that exceeds what the utility can deliver.\nBitcoin miners cried foul, including local operation Bitfarms. The startup\u2019s co-founder bemoaned a possible rate hike, saying in a statement:\n\u201cWe are building the computing power and electrical infrastructure that will power the blockchain with Quebec hydroelectric power,\u201d said Pierre-Luc Quimper, pointing to the dozens of jobs that the company has ushered into the region.\nPlus, according to Bitfarms\u2019 Twitter page, they had planned to hire hundreds more across analyst, technician, engineer and developer positions.\nAlso read: Quebec electricity utility slammed with requests from cryptocurrency miners\nMining Requests Pour In\nEric Martel, CEO of the utility, said last week he has received hundreds of applications in the past few weeks.

Today, the market dropped by nearly $30 billion in value, as major cryptocurrencies recorded losses.\nOn March 5, CCN reported that the price of Ripple gained momentum due to unverified rumors which claimed Coinbase, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency brokerage and wallet platform, will integrate Ripple this week. CCN\u2019s report emphasized that if the unconfirmed rumors do not turn out to be true and Coinbase does not integrate Ripple, the price of the cryptocurrency could fall by large margins.\n\u201cThis anticipation could also lead to a large drop in the price of Ripple if Coinbase ends up not integrating Ripple, as it did last year, when similar rumors emerged. It is unlikely that Coinbase will integrate Ripple this week, given that it is still dealing with class action lawsuits regarding insider trading allegations against Coinbase employees,\u201d CCN reported.\nOver the past 24 hours, almost immediately after Coinbase released an official announcement that clarified the company\u2019s plans to not add any new asset on the Coinbase trading platform or GDAX in the short-term, the price of Ripple fell by more than 11 percent.\nThe official statement of Coinbase read, \u201cour January 4th, 2018 statement continues to stand: we have made no decision to add additional assets to either GDAX or Coinbase. Any statement to the contrary is untrue and not authorized by the company.\u201d\nRipple\u2019s price peaked at 1.08 percent on March 5, recording a staggering 20 percent increase in value. As of March 6, the price of Ripple remains below 0.92.\n\nOn January 4, Coinbase released a statement entitled \u201cOur process for adding new assets\u201d after a flurry of rumors emerged, which falsely claimed that Coinbase was planning to integrate Ripple. The price of Ripple spiked by more than 20 percent during that week, similar to this week.\nAt the time, the Coinbase team wrote, \u201ca committee of internal experts is responsible for determining whether and when new assets will be added to the platform in accordance with our framework. These individuals \u2014 and all employees at Coinbase \u2014 are subject to confidentiality and trading restrictions,\u201d emphasizing that the company is more cautious in adding new assets and strict in sustaining confidentiality regarding new cryptocurrency integrations.\nBuying rumors or trading based on unconfirmed news can be extremely risky. If the rumors don\u2019t turn out to be true, and in most cases they don\u2019t, traders can experience a significant drop in the asset they invested in.\nMarket Recap\nBitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Cardano, five of the largest cryptocurrencies in the market apart from Ripple, have also recorded around 4 percent decline in value on average, as the market fell by over $30 billion.\nOther smaller cryptocurrencies like Ziliqa, Factom, Nano, and Ethereum Classic experienced major losses, with Nano and Ethereum Classic dropping by more than 12 percent.\nIn the futures market, short positions targeting major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum have been opened, and many long positions have been closed.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

As well as opening the platform, Penjie suggested providing greater investor education regarding blockchain technology.\nThe official report states:\n\u201c[A]fter sound domestic laws and regulations, under the unified cooperation of the Central Bank and the CSRC, a regulated, efficient and clean blockchain digital asset trading platform will be set up for enterprises to raise funds [and trade digital assets.\u201d\nWhilst Penjie\u2019s suggestion is not an official statement of intent by Chinese authorities, it does represent a noticeable change in perceptions of blockchain technology by officials. It follows a full-page article on the benefits of blockchain technology in China\u2019s official news outlet, The People\u2019s Daily from last week. The piece was extremely bullish, referring to the technology as \u201chighly ingenious\u201d and next internet.\nThese developments may be indications of a changing policy towards blockchain and cryptocurrency in China. Whilst official sanctioning of the technology is not yet a reality, there is certainly a highly positive sentiment emanating from many circles in Chinese society.\nAn article from Sohu\u00a0yesterday is one example. It brought together the opinions of over twenty Chinese business leaders, innovators, and regulatory officials and almost all of them had only positive statements to make regarding developing distributed legend technologies, including cryptocurrencies.\nProminent Zeng Ming, chairman of the Academic Committee of Alibaba Group, which reported revenue of $23.82 billion last year, said\n\u201cthe blockchain is a revolution in the relations of production and will inevitably bring about major changes in productivity and a true supply-side revolution\u201d\nThis sentiment was shared by Yao Jinbo, founder of 58.com, China\u2019s largest classified site and with a personal valuation of $1.2 billion.\n\u201cwe take the initiative to embrace, to explore the blockchain. Blockchain has the decentralization and deintermediation characteristics, which may be as great as the Internet, which may be a [bigger] historical opportunity than artificial intelligence\u201d\nOthers were equally enthusiastic. Cai Wenshseng, Chairman of technology giant Meitu spoke of blockchain technology as both a technological and cognitive revolution. Meanwhile Xu Xiaoping, founder of True Fund, issued a literal call to arms, imploring CEOs to join him \u201call in on blockchain\u201d. His words could not have been more confident: \u201d Do not doubt the blockchain, do not hesitate, immediately mobilize all staff to embrace the blockchain.\u201d\nThe statements from big industry players in China are not just hot air. This month it was announced that a subsidiary of the consumer giant Alibaba had successfully implemented blockchain technology to handle logistics data. At the time of writing over 30,000 imported goods, ranging from Shanghai to Shenzen had been logged with the system.\nIt appears that China will enthusiastically adopt blockchain technology across industries, with a broad range of use cases. However, there has been some distinction between decentralized virtual currencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. China has already banned foreign cryptocurrency trading platforms, blocking access to sites using its national firewall. Many observers have interpreted developments in the nation as damning for decentralized currencies \u2013 but today\u2019s announcement that a national trading platform could be launched may be a turnaround.\nWhilst there has not been official confirmation the project will go ahead, and it is also unclear whether Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other decentralized currencies would be included, today\u2019s news marks a ray of hope.\nThat\u2019s because Pengjie\u2019s suggestion did not explicitly rule out decentralized currencies from being included.\nThe reopening of Chinese markets would be hugely bullish for cryptocurrency prices \u2013 at the time of the closure of exchanges, Chinese traders represented some 40% of total market share. We would likely see a huge flood of investors looking to get involved.\nWhether this will come to pass is currently speculative, but with enthusiasm for blockchain technology growing significantly, we may not have to wait long to find out.", "category": "Blockchain News"}

Kakao Corp is planning to announce a concrete roadmap to outline its\u00a0plans in a press conference on March 20th, the Huffington Post Korea reports.\nAccording to Korean publication MT, the establishment of the new blockchain-specific unit also sees Kakao exploring the launch of its own cryptocurrency, \u2018Kakao Coin\u2019, through an initial coin offering (ICO). Kakao is looking at overseas jurisdictions, Singapore and Hong Kong in particular, to launch and conduct its ICO as they are currently ruled illegal in South Korea. As reported previously, South Korea\u2019s financial regulator moved to ban initial coin offerings in late September 2017.\nWith its own cryptocurrency, Kakao is also planning to reportedly introduce the token in a number of services and applications including Kakao Driver, Kakao Games and KakaoTalk as a direct substitute for fiat money. Users of Kakao Corp\u2019s applications like KakaoTalk and KakaoPay, the mobile payment subsidiary of the company, will be able to use Kakao Coin like cash in payments within the company\u2019s applications with products sold at a lower cost for crypto payments.\nWith an estimated 93% of South Korea\u2019s population using KakaoTalk as their preferred messaging platform, the launch and usage of Kakao Coin are certain to be followed keenly in a jurisdiction that continues to outlaw ICOs to this day. Kakao, through a subsidiary, has already forayed into the cryptocurrency space with the launch of Upbit, a cryptocurrency exchange with support for some 110 tokens last September.\nKakao\u2019s reported plans for an ICO follow the $850 million ICO presale of popular encrypted messaging app Telegram in February.

Similar rumors have swirled for several months, presumably because Ripple is the only top five-cryptocurrency not listed on Coinbase. At present, the platform supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin.\nRipple backers strongly believe that XRP will be added to Coinbase in the near future.

Other traders moved to over-the-counter (OTC) and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms, often using social media to find trading partners and execute transactions.\nConsequently, authorities began monitoring internet traffic to offshore exchanges, particularly those which had originally been headquartered on the mainland.

Once shares are publicly-quoted, they have more liquidity and can also be purchased through retail brokerage accounts \u2014 though often at a steep premium over the value of the underlying assets.\nThough anathema to many financial analysts due to its heavy premium on the secondary market, the Bitcoin Investment Trust has proven to be extremely popular among both buyers who are nervous to hold cryptoassets directly and investors who desire to gain exposure to Bitcoin through tax-advantaged retirement accounts.\nPrior to GBTC\u2019s recent stock split \u2014 a move that made the trust even more appealing to retail investors \u2014 the trust was among the most-purchased assets on investing app Stockpile, which allows investors to purchase fractional shares of expensive stocks.\nGrayscale Trust Lineup Swells to Eight\nAltogether, Grayscale now offers eight different cryptocurrency investment products, including the Ethereum Classic Investment Trust and Zcash Investment Trust.\nLast month, Grayscale launched the \u201cDigital Large Cap Fund,\u201d a cryptocurrency index fund that holds market cap-weighted positions in the five largest cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase is being accused of negligence tied to last year\u2019s rocky rollout of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and \u201ctipping off\u201d its employees before announcing publicly its plans to support the\u00a0new cryptocurrency. The amount in question for all of the members of the lawsuit is more than $5 million before interest and costs.\nArizona resident Jeffrey Berk filed the lawsuit in the US District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of himself and others affected, all of whom are being represented by Green & Noblin as well as The Grant Law Firm.\nHe\u2019s taking aim at Coinbase/dba GDAX as well as its co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong and director of communications David Farmer, alleging Armstrong knew of the alleged insider trading and promised an investigation, the results of which are unclear.\nAt the crux of the lawsuit is the bitcoin hard fork, the result of which was the emergence Bitcoin Cash, a cryptocurrency spinoff, so to speak, designed to accelerate transactions on the blockchain. After the bitcoin fork was announced, Coinbase allegedly waffled on its decision of whether or not to support it, which allegedly caused the plaintiffs \u201cto suffer monetary loss as a result of the defendants\u2019 wrongdoing.\u201d\u00a0The lawsuit states:\n\u201cAs one of the largest exchanges for the purchase and sale of Bitcoin, (and\neffectively a monopoly), the issue of whether Coinbase will maintain a market and support a cryptocurrency is essential to people who want to buy or sell the currencies.\u201d\nBotched Rollout\nThe period in question is from Dec. 19 to Dec. 21, which is when Coinbase\u2019s alleged botched rollout of Bitcoin cash unfolded. There were, however, a series of steps leading up to this event, as outlined below \u2013\n\nIn July, Coinbase announced it wouldn\u2019t support BCH\nCoinbase advised clients who wished to trade in BCH to instead withdraw their BTC from the exchange\nA wave of investors allegedly did do\nIn August, Coinbase revealed partial support for BCH\n\nHere\u2019s the rub.\n\nIn November 2017, Coinbase allegedly \u201ctipped off its own employees about full support for BCH\u201d\nCoinbase didn\u2019t announce that development publicly till Dec. 19, 2017\nApproximately USD 11 billion of BCH was traded on Coinbase on Dec. 20\n\nApparently, traders who anticipated Coinbase\u2019s full support of BCH flooded the platform with buy and sell orders, which the lawsuit alleges thinned liquidity and \u201cunfairly drive up the price of BCH for non-insider traders once BCH\u00a0came on line on the Coinbase exchange.\u201d\nThe plaintiff alleges that his BCH order was transacted at a price 100% higher than when he submitted the buy order.\nThese events preceded even greater confusion amid a series of steps in which the bitcoin exchange allegedly stopped and started trading in BCH, opening and closing the books again and again. The bottom line is the plaintiffs allege that non-insiders were forced to purchase BCH at inflated prices.\nA separate class-action lawsuit was filed against Coinbase earlier this month accusing the bitcoin exchange of holding onto emailed cryptocurrencies that it shouldn\u2019t have that were left unclaimed for years.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

House Bill 5335, aka the Revenue Cryptocurrency Bill, is being sponsored by Rep. Michael Zalewski, a Democrat.\nIt\u2019s an amendment to the current Department of Revenue Law of the Civil Administrative Code of Illinois, and it declares that \u201cin addition to any other method of payment provided for by law,\u201d\u00a0 cryptocurrencies will be accepted as payment for state taxes. The state would then convert the cryptocurrency payment into fiat money \u201cat the prevailing rate\u201d within 24 hours, and the taxpayers account becomes credited with the converted USD amount.\nThe bill was first introduced in February and in recent days was assigned to the Revenue and Finance Committee.\nIt\u2019s really been a wave of states showing an interest in adding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into their revenue streams.\u00a0Wyoming, which is also competing for the title of blockchain capital, is considering a bill that would lift state\u00a0property tax on cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, similar to Illinois, Arizona and Georgia are looking to legalize bitcoin as a payment for taxes.\nSomething for investors to consider when paying taxes with bitcoin or some other digital coin is that it could qualify as a tax event. For instance, if you purchased $1,000 worth of bitcoin and the value of that investment balloons to $5,000 on tax day, that\u2019s a capital gain and it will be taxed as such.\nMidwestern Tech Hub\nIllinois has been jockeying for position among states to take the lead in\u00a0technology, including but not limited to\u00a0blockchain. For instance, the city of Chicago is\u00a0on the list\u00a0for\u00a0Amazon\u2019s second headquarters. While Amazon already employs more than 10,000 people in the Windy City on a full-time basis, Amazon HQ2 would usher in 50,000 more jobs and billions of dollars in investment.\nMeanwhile, the\u00a0Illinois Blockchain Initiative is comprised of state and county agencies dedicated to exploring how blockchain can bolster state services while appealing to the blockchain community.\nAnd the Illinois Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Task Force recently published a report to the General Assembly. The report highlights ways for the government to use blockchain as a \u201ccheaper and safer way to administer government.\u201d\nIn addition to new innovation that the blockchain would inspire, the technology would be \u201cideal\u201d for Medicaid enrollment and social programs such as food stamps.\u00a0But they want\u00a0to see blockchain \u201cimprove its scalability and smart contract security first.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Law"}

However, a newly released letter drafted by an official with the Department of the Treasury suggests that ICOs may also be subject to criminal statutes governing money transfer businesses.\nThe letter, which was addressed to Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and dated Feb. 13 but only released on Tuesday, said that companies that sell \u201cconvertible virtual currency\u201d must comply with bank secrecy and know-your-customer guidelines, rules which were put in place to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.\nFrom the letter:\n\u201cGenerally, under existing regulations and interpretations, a developer that sells convertible virtual currency, including in the form of ICO coins or tokens, in exchange for another type of value that substitutes for currency is a money transmitter and must comply with AML/CFT requirements that apply to this type of MSB [money services business].\u201d\nPeter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, wrote in a blog post that he believes this interpretation of the Bank Secrecy Act is \u201chighly consequential\u201d and raises \u201cmajor licensing problem for ICOs.\u201d\nIn his view, any ICO that involved US residents (as issuers or investors) and failed to register with the Financial Crimes and Enforcement Network (FinCEN) \u2014 a Treasury bureau tasked with preventing and investigating financial crimes \u2014 could be charged under 18 U.S.C \u00a7 1960, a federal felony criminal statute that carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. If broadly interpreted, Van Valkenburgh said that this statute could be enforced retroactively and render employees of, and investors in, the business culpable as well.\nBloomberg reports that some ICO operators had already registered with FinCEN, anticipating that money transfer regulations could be applied to them. However, it is likely that most have not.\nMeanwhile, ICOs are reportedly facing intense scrutiny from the SEC as well. As CCN reported, the agency issued subpoenas to as many as 80 token sales and has asked other ICOs \u2014 including the Overstock-sponsored tZero ICO \u2014 to voluntarily submit documents about \u201ceverything\u201d related to the offerings.", "category": "ICO News"}

Investing in cryptocurrencies has huge risks associated so read as much as possible to make better informed decisions\u2013\nIn my last articles we\u2019ve been discussing how smart money and dumb money forces push the price upwards or downwards. If we align this trend with the lack of interest from the general population over cryptocurrency and bitcoin, it becomes clear why has the price been moving sideways.\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/\nSocial Media trend lines\nOne thing I really like to do is to see how people have been feeling about bitcoin lately. To do that we can check google trends for example.\nhttps://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&q=bitcoin,bitcoin%20price,cryptocurrency\nYes, the spikes match the huge price increases and drops which happen throughout late November 2017 to February 2018. What we see for March 2018 is a continue drop of people\u2019s interest on bitcoin.\nWorldwide volume\nAnother key feature of understanding price is looking into how much new money is coming into cryptocurrencies market. To do that, we look at volume.\nhttps://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/30d?c=e&t=b\nLooks shady, right? As you can see volume has been quite low across all exchanges. And we\u2019re looking into bitcoin, the most traded cryptocurrency there is. This also shows that clearly there is no new money coming into bitcoin, at least not smart money, as low volume usually means no huge quantity of fresh cash is coming into the market. If we check the number of trades this should give us a confirmation of what we just hypothesised, this is, if the number of trades is dropping over time.\nhttps://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/30d?c=e&t=b\nThere you have it. Lower trade volume means lower volume, which most likely comes from the lack of new people entering the bitcoin market.\n\u2013Man, I Love Bitcoinity, their interface to check out different data sources is top-notch. Highly advise you to check it out\u2013\nNew developments\nAlthough no new people are betting on bitcoin, this doesn\u2019t mean the technology hasn\u2019t been improving. Over the last couple of months two major breakthroughs happened. Well, three to be precise.\n\nSegwit implementation via a softfork during the summer (August 2017);\nThe lightning network being successfully used in the testnet to buy pizza (twice!);\nSegwit actually being adopted by bigger players like exchanges.\n\nTo prove how wonderful this has been I will base my findings In two different sets of data. First we see how the hashrate is looking, this is, the number of machines trying to solve blocks, hence supporting the network.\n\nAs you can see it has been increasing over time. These are wonderful news although mining pools are a bit centralized, which can be a problem. Nevertheless more and more resources are coming into bitcoin, which to me is a good thing. I don\u2019t support the view that PoW is a total waste of energy as if used worldwide, energy consumption wouldn\u2019t suddenly skyrocket as there is no connection between the number of miners and the number of users, plus PoW has been the only consensus mechanism that has been proven to work in a larger scale. If PoS, directed acrylic graphs, hashgraph, byzantine fault tolerance and many other options that exist to reach consensus work in larger scales, then I\u2019m completely for to adopting a new method. Until then, let\u2019s just stick to what actually works and test different options.\nSecondly, we look at the amount of data on each block, as the purpose of segwit was to make blocks smaller, so capable of having more transactions per block. To check if there has been community support what we do is we check the average segwit transaction count:\nhttp://segwit.party/charts/\nAdoption is increasing among big players, as there has been a huge spike recently. More however if we look into segwit transaction adoption rates we\u2019re also greeted with a quite positive outlook.\n\nWhere will the price go? Upwards or Downwards?\nMany different outcomes may come to price and as some TA experts point out, low support levels exist because they have huge amounts of orders ready to accumulate bitcoin at lower prices.\nhttps://hacked.com/technical-analysis-bitcoin-nears-6-week-high/\nNevertheless the trend line is positive as long as Bitcoin doesn\u2019t go below the $11,000 line.\nIf you want my personal (and not financial) advise on how to behave, this is what I usually do:\n\nFollow the smart-money: buy when low, sell when high.\nDon\u2019t get over-hyped by news. 90% don\u2019t actually matter.\nListen to people that possess some form of expertise in cryptocurrency and then try to adapt what I learned to my personal strategies (trading, analysis, technology development, etc).\nThink for yourself and don\u2019t get greedy. Owning your mistakes is the easiest way to improve.\n\nAt the end of the day for a new technology to be exciting it necessarily has to be over-hyped. If you can share with me in the comments section down below, any example of a completely undervalued technology that later dominated the market, I\u2019m all ears.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPatience.
