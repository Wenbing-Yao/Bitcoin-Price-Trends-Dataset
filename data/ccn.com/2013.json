The problem is explained by whether someone who mines Bitcoins for themselves can trade the Bitcoins for fiat money at an exchange or spend them without being classified as a Money Service Business (which forces the miner to register with FinCEN).\nMany Bitcoin miners have been concerned that tough regulation from FinCEN would mean that they would have to require an auditor staff, hence making it hard for individuals to mine Bitcoins and follow the regulation requirements. This would have made the Bitcoin mining community even more centralized than it is today.\nAtlantic City Bitcoin have many ASIC miners at its facility in New Jersey and asked FinCEN to clarify their standing regarding Bitcoin mining. FinCEN replied with a statement saying that miners do not have to register with FinCEN as long as they mine for their own use.\nFinCEN\u2019s statement:\nTo the extent that a user mines Bitcoin and uses the Bitcoin solely for the user\u2019s own purposes and not for the benefit of another, the user is not an MSB under FinCEN\u2019s regulations, because these activities involve neither \u201cacceptance\u201d nor \u201ctransmission\u201d of the convertible virtual currency and are not the transmission of funds within the meaning of the Rule. This is the case whether the user mining and using the Bitcoin is an individual or a corporation, and whether the user is purchasing goods or services for the user\u2019s own use, paying debts previously incurred in the ordinary course of business, or (in the case of a corporate user) making distributions to shareholders. Activities that, in and of themselves, do not constitute accepting and transmitting currency, funds or the value of funds, are activities that do not fit within the definition of \u201cmoney transmission services\u201d and therefore are not subject to FinCEN\u2019s registration, reporting, and recordkeeping regulations for MSBs\u2026\nFinCEN therefore concludes that, under the facts you have provided, Atlantic would be a user of Bitcoin, and not an MSB, to the extent that it uses Bitcoin it has mined: (a) to pay for the purchase of goods or services, pay debts it has previously incurred (including debts to its owner(s)), or make distributions to owners; or (b) to purchase real currency or another convertible virtual currency, so long as the real currency or other convertible virtual currency is used solely in order to make payments (as set forth above) or for Atlantic\u2019s own investment purposes.

Such risk. Much pointless.\nInitially, these were the thoughts going through my head when I decided to buy some Dogecoins. However, as the owner of about 5000 Dogecoins, I regret nothing. First of all, those coins were worth about $3.00 at the time of purchase. Hardly a risk. Let me start by going through the process of purchasing my coins.\nThere aren\u2019t many exchanges that offer Dogecoin. Three that I knew of were Cryptsy, Coins-E, and CoinEx.\nCryptsy was probably the worst in terms of overall experience.\u00a0Everything about it was slow. Depositing my BTC took well over an hour. While the site claimed that deposits post after 4 confirmations, It ended up taking around 10. Next, I decided to buy as many DOGE as I could with my deposited BTC \u2013 about 1740. I placed my order and had to wait a couple of hours before my order was fulfilled. Finally, I decided to withdraw my newly purchased Dogecoins. The withdrawal was not instant, but instead took several more hours to be completed. As I said,\u00a0everything about Cryptsy was slow. Even navigating the different pages of the website took a long time on their slow servers. However, Cryptsy had a fairly easy-to-use and cleanish UI. Despite that, I would not recommend Cryptsy to anyone.\n\nCoins-E was the next exchange that I used. While its UI seemed a lot more cluttered than Cryptsy,\u00a0\u00a0the overall process of purchasing Dogecoins was a lot faster here. Coins-E also stated that 4 confirmations were required for deposits to get credited. It actually took 5 confirmations, but that\u2019s much better than Cryptsy. The next step was placing my order. My order was confirmed within seconds and fulfilled within the hour. After that, I decided to withdraw my coins, and this occurred instantly. Coins-E was the best out of the three.\n\nThe last exchange that I used was CoinEx. CoinEx features a relatively clean and simple UI \u2013 unfortunately too simple. The site is missing many features that Cryptsy and Coins-E have. Furthermore, it has an annoying chat box that is impossible to hide. To be fair, the site is in beta, so improvements are expected. Depositing my BTC to CoinEx was very fast, requiring less than 4 confirmations. My buy order for Dogecoin was half fulfilled within seconds while the other half was fulfilled the next day. Withdrawals were also instant. CoinEx has promise, but for now it cannot really compare to Cryptsy and Coins-E.\nSo now I\u2019ve got about 5000 Dogecoins \u2013 a currency that no one, including its creators, takes too seriously. So is there any point in Dogecoins? There is.\nUnlike Bitcoin, which is often associated by the public with drugs and other crime, Dogecoin is associated with a silly meme. Furthermore, Dogecoin has a very enthusiastic and friendly community at reddit, making it a great choice for newbies just starting to learn about cryptocurrency. Even though Dogecoin isn\u2019t worth much currently, it\u2019s great to see optimistic chimes of \u201cDOGECOIN TO THE MOON!\u201d. Dogecoin could serve as a friendly, entry-level cryptocurrency before moving on to more serious currencies like Bitcoin.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

We deeply apologize for the sudden change. BTC China, December 16, 2013\nIt was just on September 24, 2013 that BTC China announced that they were eliminating trading fees. \u00a0In the few short months between then and now, BTC China has surpassed Mt.

It was never meant to be standalone currency. That idea was conjured up by the players of the game. Every game community would like their in-game currency to have real world value. Play a game for money? Where do I sign up?\nWhat is being lost in this push to have corporations and governments grant Bitcoin as the holy grail of value storage, is a payment processing system has been created that trumps all predecessors. We now have a system of payment that can accept a percentage fee for even the most micro transaction. Before Bitcoin, we had Paypal and Western Union. The fixed costs in protecting and running those systems created a floor on transaction size. It was never worth it to send your buddy $2 when Paypal charged a minimum of $5 to act as agent on the transaction. Imagine further sending a wire for $2. The cost alone is $20 so this never made sense. We are headed down one of two paths. Either a group of wealthy people, organizations, governments rally around these coins and honor transactions among themselves (our present fiat currency system) or the coins start paying their bounties in the fiat currency of the miners choosing. So when a block is broken the miner gets Dollars/ Euros/ Pounds/Yen instead of Bitcoin. Or simply create a new coin that does this from the beginning. The payment processing system remains (and all of the value that it will create) and we can remain on the same currency systems that we are presently. In essence replacing cash with this new paradigm of the Bitcoin Payment System. This system was never created to solve large transactions. It was simply developed to allow for the most micro transaction to happen anywhere in the world, comfortably from your present location.\nThe Bitcoin Payment System incorporates all of the benefits of cash and a credit card in one. Close to immediate clearance of cash and the safety of carrying a credit card. Would you ever walk up to the owner of a house and say, I will buy your house in cash and get out now? Never. Would you walk up to the counter at a deli and attempt to pay for your coffee with a check?\nThere is a payment system for every size transaction. This sell off is because Baidu isn\u2019t accepting Bitcoin. As a community we can not hope that the major players will accept Bitcoin. We need to rally around the payment system that Satoshi created.

We\u2019ve been through a passage of USB ASIC miners (the Block Erupters) which are now rapidly declining in price.\nIt has recently come to my attention that there are 2 new ASIC\u2019s announced, which are supposedly in stock. That is something you don\u2019t see too often (but it has happened before). So let\u2019s take a look at these two new Bitcoin ASIC\u2019s, shall we?\nFirst up, we have the Red Fury USB miner. Yes, that\u2019s right, a new USB miner. Although you can\u2019t quite compare it to the Block Erupter, because it runs a lot faster, and is also carrying an entirely different chipset.\nRed Fury USB Miner\nThe Red Fury USB Miner contains a BitFury chip , which you might had already guessed by paying close attention to the device\u2019s name. Why red, you wonder? Simple! They have a red led on the board, which indicated they are mining. Ah, those little things in life amuse me\u2026. But anyway, let\u2019s take a closer look at the specs of this new miner.\nThe Red Fury USB Miner\u2019s creator (or vendor?) claims that these babies run at 2.5 GH/s, which makes them roughly 7.5 times as efficient as a USB Block Erupter. Off to a good start i\u2019ld say. But, if it\u2019s more powerful, it should also require more power, right? Well, it\u2019s not as bad as you might expect. In the development of these ASIC chips, the manufacturers also have the power consumption in mind, and BitFury seems to have done a great job.\nApparently, these devices run on 2.5 watts and 500 mA, like the Block Erupter. So you basically get a way more efficient USB miner, using the same amount of power. That\u2019s excellent! But, this doesn\u2019t come cheap of course. A Red Fury USB Miner will cost you 2.1 Bitcoin (as of this writing), however, this also INCLUDES worldwide shipping. All in all, it\u2019s not a bad price, considering the price of 1 BitFury chip is 130$, and shipping is usually 0.15-0.4 BTC. Products will be shipped from Indonesia, so you may be subject to paying VAT/Customs fees when buying these items.\nThere is a dark side to this coin aswell though. The person selling them on BitcoinTalk has uploaded several images, aswell as a Youtube video showing the devices in action. However, there is no website for these products. And the only payment information we have is a Bitcoin address in the topic\u2019s original post. This is not unusual, but so far no one from BitcoinTalk has confirmed they actually received the product.\nPLEASE NOTE : i am NOT claiming this a scam. I\u2019m just giving you a heads up, as I\u2019m sure you are all adults, very capable of making your own monetary decisions.\nI\u2019ve also enquired about reviewing a free demo unit, but that request was swiftly declined. Understandable, because I\u2019m not an actual developer for one of mining programs. Ckolivas, the developer of CGMiner, will be sent a unit in the next week(s). This does mean that the current version of mining programs will most likely NOT work with the mining program you use right now. This, i cannot confirm, we\u2019ll have to wait and see i suppose.\nThe second Bitcoin ASIC we will discuss is called the HashBuster. Catchy name, isn\u2019t it? This miner is comparable to the Red Fury USB Miner, as they both run the same speeds (~2.5GH/s) because they use the same BitFury chipset. Power consumption is a different matter though. The Red Fury USB Miner can be connected to any USB port on your computer or USB hub. The HashBuster comes with a Molex connector, which has to be plugged in to your PSU. The required voltage for the HashBuster is between 5v and 15v, however, 12v is supposed to be optimal.\nShould you order this device, you will receive a 40mm fan and a USB cable aswell. Basically, a complete package to get you up and running as soon as you receive it. Pricewise, the HashBuster is also slightly more expensive than the Red Fury USB Miner. The HashBuster comes at the price of 2.5 Bitcoin, EXCLUDING shipping costs. Worldwide shipping is available for 0.2 Bitcoin added to the price of the device.\nWhether or not the HashBuster is supported by your favorite mining program is unknown as of this writing, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it doesn\u2019t work 100% correctly yet. However, I\u2019m sure that the mining software developers will work hard to support the new devices as soon as possible.\nAs with the Red Fury USB Miner, you cannot buy the HashBuster on a website. There is a topic on BitcoinTalk about the device, with some pictures, but no Youtube video (yet). If you try to visit www.hashbuster.com, you\u2019ll simply be redirected to the BitcoinTalk topic.\nI\u2019ve also enquired about reviewing a free demo unit for the HashBuster, but i was met with the same reply as i had received from the Red Fury USB Miner seller. As said before, completely understandable. This does create both credibility and suspicion though. Credibility because they aren\u2019t desperate for putting units into atleast 1 person\u2019s hand, but suspicion because we have no actual proof of the devices existing or being shipped.\nOnce again, I\u2019m NOT claiming either of the devices are a scam, you are smart enough to do research & make your own decisions.\nConclusion : it looks like the ASIC market has gotten a bit bigger now, with two new devices which \u201cshould\u201d be available for immediate dispatch. Both run at similar speeds, yet require a slightly different power supply.

Soon after that, China Telecom, a state-owned telecommunications company that is the second largest in the industry in China, also started accepting Bitcoin for reservations of their latest Samsung phone. These two companies, the so-called \u201cChinese Google\u201d on the one hand and a state-owned telecommunications company on the other, were seen as by far the largest endorsement of Bitcoin that has ever happened to date. And now, in the span of a few hours, they are both gone.\nIn reality, however, the influence of both companies has always been overhyped. The Baidu announcement was not \u201cBaidu accepting Bitcoin\u201d to anything close to the extent to which, say, Namecheap accepts Bitcoin for its entire array of products and services. Rather, Baidu Jiasule is only one small subsidiary of Baidu. In fact, the company received very few actual customers \u2013 the 1.37 BTC that the company did receive was the product of Western Bitcoin users sending Baidu donations to show support. Similarly, in the case of China Telecom, China Telecom was not accepting Bitcoin for its telecom services; it was only taking it for pre-orders of the latest Samsung phone. The Chinese economy is much more organizationally centralized on both a government and corporate level, but what many do not understand the system to some extent naturally compensates for this to a partial extent by giving individual corporate divisions and local governments considerably more independence. Although Baidu Jiasule almost certainly did get approval from Baidu\u2019s management before taking Bitcoin, neither Baidu mangement nor Baidu Jiasule ever intended for the announcement to be anything close to a company-wide endorsement. Now, the portion of the Bitcoin bubble that relied on this mistaken assumption can be officially considered to be popped.\nThere has been an inordinate amount of information and sentiment lost in translation in the last few months as weaker and weaker hands have jumped onto the Bitcoin bandwagon; personally, I suspect that the majority of that bubble was caused by Westerners that to this day still are unaware that Baidu Jiasule is but a small subsidiary of Baidu. \u00a0Furthermore, they are unaware that China already has harsh rules against \u201cvirtual currencies\u201d in place and Bitcoin being classified as a \u201cvirtual commodity\u201d is the brightest Green Light that Bitcoin has ever received.\nI hope that those investors/speculators/spectators that are turned away by their short term losses trading Bitcoin are turned away for good. \u00a0The type of people that don\u2019t understand the true value of Bitcoin as a protocol are the exact same type of people that panic sell and exacerbate the volatility of the Bitcoin exchange rate. \u00a0Very very simply, they are the problem that they see in Bitcoin.", "category": "News"}

Gox exchange. A clear double top pattern emphasises the high at $1250, where motivated sellers lurk. A break above this level and Bitcoin is back to the races.\nFollowing a weekend of initially unsettling news out of China (plus a little trash-talk from Alan \u201cdot-com bubble\u201d Greenspam), a big red candle reveals significant profit-taking after Bitcoin\u2019s tremendous run-up from the \u201cSilk Road seizure\u201d low of $109.\nTaking DPR\u2019s early, ugly October as our most recent low \u2013 and also as a clear signal to investors / speculators that Bitcoin\u2019s value was largely independant of its infamous \u201cseed market\u201d \u2013 we draw a Fibonacci retracement up to the highs. These Fibonacci levels may seem arbitrary but price often exhibits a surprisingly magnetic attraction to them. In combination with established Support/Resistance levels, moving averages, large round numbers and other significant info or patterns, they\u2019re a handy aid to the voodoo science of charting.\nSo, the Fib levels reveal some possible support levels; where we might expect the price to bounce or at least hesitate \u2013 if indeed the sell-off continues through next week. Fibs are especially useful here as we\u2019re mostly charting \u201cblue sky territory\u201d without established S/R levels or intact trendlines.\nAs I write, a short green candle dithers just above the 50% retracement line on low volume. This could be the \u201cdead cat bounce\u201d before the bleeding continues, or the start of a possible reversal (of the reversal). As always, hindsight is easy but the \u201chard right edge\u201d of the chart remains problematic\u2026\nA bit further down, we have the 61.8% level. What\u2019s interesting at this level (around $550 in price terms) is that when broken to the upside in mid-November, price ignited into a rocket ride \u2013 that huge green candle. A lot of people clearly thought the top of that candle, $800, was the \u201cblow-off top\u201d culmination of the post-Silk Road run-up\u2026 But then the second wave of buyers took us up to fresh highs.\nAnyway, if we continue down, my ideal point to buy in would be the 78.6% level around $375. This would be a very serious retracement, indicative of most new entrants losing faith in Bitcoin and I consider it unlikely. Historically, price clearly struggled for 4 or 5 days to break through resistance at this level, and often such resistance levels become support once broken. The confluence of this S/R line with the 78.6% level would be my best guess at where Bitcoin will bottom out in a worst case \u201ccrash\u201d scenario. A fall back below $375 would attract tremendously negative press coverage, and I think those deeply invested in Bitcoin, with deep pockets to match, would fight such a precipitous drop tooth and nail.\nBest case scenario: the positive news out of the UK (exchanges are no longer burdened by a 20% tax on Bitcoin transactions, as documented elsewhere on this site) sees us right back up to test the highs in the coming week.\nLikely case: after all this frantic action, the Bitcoin price takes a short breather as market particpants pause to reflect on likely true value and consider future developments. We could churn around the 23.6% and 61.8% levels for a while, barring major developments. In my view, Bitcoin\u2019s long-term potential remains tremendous and undimmed, so I\u2019ll be looking to pick up bargains if we see any further downside.\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that sentiment is currently balanced between bulls and bears edit: very bullish, at least as measured by the Predictious prediction market. Such prediction markets, as predicted by early cypherpunks and now better-enabled by cryptocurrency, are themselves worthy of further investigation by crypto enthusiasts\u2026\nThis is a part of the Cryptocurrency Investment Club by CryptoCoinsNews.com.\nJoin our FREE and EXCLUSIVE Cryptocurrency Investment Club!

But is it possible to make money from a falling Bitcoin price? Well, it is now!\nBut let\u2019s start at the beginning, by defining terms. In trading, a bet that price will fall is called a \u201cshort.\u201d This is the opposite of a \u201clong,\u201d which is buying something in the expectation of a future price rise. Probably a lot of people reading this are long cryptocurrency, or at least thinking of going long. The old joke for people who\u2019ve bet the farm on a long position is that they\u2019re \u201clong like John\u201d (Holmes, the pornstar).\nOK, but taking out a short position on Bitcoin is problematic due to cryptocurrency being a bad fit for the process by which regular shorts work. You see, in order to short, you first borrow however many units of the instrument (be it a stock, currency; whatever) and then sell them into the market. To close out the short, you must then buy back the corresponding volume of the instrument. Simply put, you aim to sell high first and buy low later. The difference between your initial selling price and later buyback price is your profit \u2013 or loss, if price rises instead of falling.\nSo, if you want to short Bitcoin it\u2019d be a tricky process due to the problems inherent with lending out irreversible, decentralised and anonymisable currency\u2026 Think about it this way, would you be willing to lend a non-trivial amount of Bitcoin to a stranger? Unlike shorting through a regulated exchange, there\u2019s no central authority to manage your counterparty risk. You could really only lend cryptocurrency to people you trust absolutely \u2013 and this is why no exchange (to my knowledge) currently offers the option to short Bitcoin.\nOK, so given the above-mentioned problems with loaning out crypto, how do you short Bitcoin? Well, this is where the Predictious prediction market comes into play. For those who haven\u2019t encountered the term before, a prediction or information market allows you to bet on future events. The quoted contract price reflects the likelihood of the event occuring, as perceived by market participants. Such markets can cover outcomes from sporting victories to election results to whether Miley Cyrus will get pregnant by Vladimir Putin. Predictious is the first to offer \u201cbets\u201d on cryptocurrency, in cryptocurrency. So this, my friends, is how you effectively short Bitcoin. For example, you can currently take positions on Bitcoin\u2019s price to be at or above $1000, $1400, $1500, $2000, $3000 or $5000 before year-end. So if you believe Bitcoin is going to zero because it\u2019s all a giant digital ponzi with no inherent value, you can now happily put your life savings where your mouth is instead of trolling the Bitbros on Reddit \u2013 hurrah!\nMoving beyond speculators wishing to profit from both dips in Bitcoin\u2019s notoriously volatile pricing, the ability to go short Bitcoin also serves a valuable market function. Shorting enables one to hedge a position, which is to say insure on a long position by taking a contrary short position. Let\u2019s say you own a lot of Bitcoin, but foresee a possible fall in its value due to some forthcoming event, the next halving day perhaps. You might not wish to sell all your holdings, especially considering that trading between fiat and Bitcoin is often not the most seamless process. But what if deeply you\u2019re unsure as to whether Bitcoin\u2019s price will bounce back? Well, if you\u2019re perfectly hedged by a short, then even if price drops off a cliff you\u2019ll make as much profit on your short as loss on your long\u2026 That\u2019s a good way to sleep at night when prices get particularly volatile and uncertainty reigns. Worth considering the next time some bloated central banking entity heaves itself from out its murky den to spew Keynesian bile at Bitcoin.\nTo illustrate how using this market for shorting / hedging works in practice: the odds of Bitcoin being at or above $2000 by New Year\u2019s Eve are currently skewed to the upside \u2013 as I write this, you can sell (go short) that particular contract for 0.15 mBTC or buy it (go long) for 2.50 mBTC. If the prediction is fulfilled, you\u2019ll receive 10 mBTC for every contract you bought. Or if the prediction expires unfulfilled, you\u2019ll be paid 10 mBTC for every contract you sold. So if you believe Bitcoin will crack $2k, you can bet that way for less downside risk than buying Bitcoin itself.\u00a0 What I mean by this is: if Bitcoin is currently at $1000 and you expect it to reach $2000 before 1st Jan 2014. If you buy 1 BTC at $1000 intending to sell at $2000 your upside risk is $1000. But as price can always go to zero (maybe a massive solar flare wipes out all electronics on Earth), your downside risk is also $1000. But if you buy 100 contracts for that same scenario, at 2.50 mBTC each, you\u2019d only need to risk\u2026\u00a0 about $142\u2026 for the same upside exposure [my math can be shaky, so I recommend checking it]. Of course, in the case of actually buying Bitcoin you\u2019ll still own the Bitcoin even if your bet doesn\u2019t work out.\nFinally, as \u201cbets\u201d on prediction markets are provided by those who\u2019ve taken a definite financial stake in their being correct, you can expect a better-informed and probably more clear-headed assessment than you\u2019d get elsewhere. Indeed, popular prediction markets have been known to provide very accurate information on the future. So even for those with no interest in shorting, hedging or complex option plays (which are a subject unto themselves), this site may be a useful generator of information for crypto-financial decisions.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

In them, I am named as the President, the company location is this website FirstBlockchain.com. The Articles of Incorporation allow for issuing a certain number of shares at a certain price each in bitcoin as well.\nNext, to verify and validate the PDF document creating this new corporate structure, the original articles of incorporation were uploaded to Manuel Araoz\u2019s\u00a0Proof Of Existence\u00a0which creates a permanent, proveable and uneditable timestamped verification and validation digest of this original document in the bitcoin blockchain.\nWith these steps completed, once the articles of incorporation document is confirmed by the blockchain, I claim that \u201cFirst Blockchain Incorporated\u201d has come into existence as the world\u2019s first stateless bitcoin blockchain company. I also claim the company\u2019s right to offer shares as outlined in our articles of incorporation.\nThe Articles Of Incorporation Have Now Been Validated And Proof Permanently Embedded In The Blockchain\nThis process, along with many other potential uses of the blockchain besides Bitcoin, relies on the inherently decentralized and stateless nature of the Bitcoin blockchain. \u00a0Should that ever be compromised, then so would any of these companies built upon it. \u00a0So, companies would very much want to be reassured that no such thing could ever happen before they jump on board this new innovation.\nWhat are the advantages of having a stateless corporation? \u00a0Well, the fact that Firstblockchain Inc. is reserving the right to issue shares in Bitcoin points to one of the advantages being a lack of regulation from the Securities Exchange Commission of any country. \u00a0Any company that is built in this manner will have to be inherently based on trust as Bitcoiners will never allow direct regulation or oversight of the blockchain. \u00a0That is absurd!\nPersonally, I am imagining publicly owned stateless corporations incorporated on the blockchain where\u00a0funds can only be spent through multiple signature transactions. \u00a0What the future will hold, we shall see. \u00a0That is the reason that President of FirstBlockchain.com J.B.

Gox informing him that his funds had been withdrawn. \u00a0About $12,000 of his personal funds are now gone with absolutely no way for the rightful owner to recover them. \u00a0Just like the many times before that this has happened and been reported on /r/bitcoin, Mt. Gox\u2019s email support is unresponsive which only adds to the frustration. \u00a0However, even if Mt. Gox responded to every email they received about stolen funds, can they actually do anything to recover funds that have already been stolen?\nAny Bitcoiner will realize that once the coins are sent, Mt. Gox can\u2019t do anything more than the victim can. \u00a0This is a feature of Bitcoin, not a flaw, and part of being a Bitcoiner is realizing that putting your bitcoins online puts one password between the world and the bitcoins. \u00a0Obviously, the first step to securing ones bitcoins if one plans to store them in an online exchange is to choose a secure and never-before-cracked password. \u00a0Such a password would probably be incredibly long and not contain any combination of letters that has ever before been written in Wikipedia. \u00a0While this is general good practice, many other online services have started to offer \u00a0Two-Factor Authentication [2FA] through a separate device or email account for withdrawals and/or logging in. \u00a0Some view this as a crutch, while others view it as an adequate tool in the arsenal against black-hat actors. \u00a0Mt. Gox has previously only offered 2FA through Yubikey, a paid solution that cost $30 and frankly was not widely adopted by exchange users.\nDays ago, Mt. Gox finally released information on their newest security updates. \u00a0I hope you\u2019re as excited as i was\u2026\nHere is Mt. Gox\u2019s Resource Guide for their new security feature.\nMt. Gox is offering a \u201cone time password card\u201d [OTP] that is lithium battery operated. \u00a0Honestly, this is somewhat superior to using ones smart phone which might be stolen for its other purposes or an email for 2FA, as these two solutions are essentially just putting another password in the way between the attacker and the victim. \u00a0This OTP card functions the same way as the Yubikey\u00a0previously sold by Mt. Gox with the same purpose.\nThe difference? Mt. Gox\u2019s new OTP cost $10 more than the Yubikey.\nBoth of which cost infinitely more than setting up 2FA via Google Authenticator or even setting up email confirmations for withdrawals like competitor BTC-e does.\nWith \u201cupdates\u201d like this and long long delays on fiat withdrawals, it is no wonder that BTC China has surpassed Mt.

The primary requirements to produce oranges are land, farming equipment and labor. \u00a0Add the cost of the resources together and the farmer has a base price in which he is willing to sell them. Orange juice manufacturers are buyers of the oranges to produce a good, orange juice, that we all enjoy from time to time. The orange juice manufacturer must include the price of the oranges into their calculation of cost of producing orange juice.\u00a0 Other factors include processing the oranges into orange juice, advertising, etc. Each player adds a buffer of profit into the equation and the final product is delivered to stores and eventually sold to customers.\nInvestors in orange juice contracts offer a great hedging vehicle for all players in the process of producing orange juice.\u00a0 An investor buying orange juice contracts theoretically take ownership of the value of the finalized orange juice product at a price.\u00a0 If the cost of producing orange juice goes down, the willingness of investors to buy will decrease, sending the price of the orange juice contract lower.\u00a0 This seems simple enough to understand that the cost of production will have a direct effect on the value of the final product.\nInvestors have quite a bit more to consider when determining the price of an orange juice contract.\u00a0 What will happen to the price of the contract if orange juice suddenly is the cure for a major disease?\u00a0 Even though the cost of producing the product remains the same, the price of an orange juice contract will soar!\u00a0 Won\u2019t the farmers eventually ask for more for their oranges?\u00a0 In the short-term yes, however the market for the orange will eventually adjust back down because more people will want to farm oranges.\nWhat does this have to do with cryptocurrency?\u00a0 Well the market dynamics are very similar to the orange juice market.\u00a0 Substitute farmers with miners, and investors with\u2026well investors, and you have the beginnings of cryptocurrency valuation. Miners produce coins through a process of solving difficult mathematical equations using computers.\u00a0 These computers require electricity to maintain competitiveness among the other miners trying to do the same.\u00a0 If a coin is worth mining, the machine is turned on, producing a hash rate.\u00a0 A hash rate is how hard the computer is working to solve the equations.\u00a0 The sum total of the individual hash rates is known as the network hash rate.\nAs you can see the network hash rate is the key metric in determining the overall demand to mine a particular currency.\u00a0 Couple this metric with the price of the currency on the cryptomarkets, and we have a great canvas in which to begin painting the valuation picture of a specific coin.\nMy goal is to report significant changes in both of these metrics. \u00a0Thank you to CCN for inviting me aboard and I am committed to providing valuable, actionable and educational news from the core of the markets. \u00a0Back to the blockchains for me!\n-The Crypto Analyst\n\u00a0\nThis is a part of the Cryptocurrency Investment Club by CryptoCoinsNews.com.\nJoin our FREE and EXCLUSIVE Cryptocurrency Investment Club!

That was quickly followed in mid-October by the news that we had reached 300,000 users. Today, there are more than 600,000 consumer Bitcoin wallets on Coinbase, signaling that we are nearing a tipping point for broad adoption of Bitcoin \u2013 what we at Coinbase believe to be one of the most important shifts in the global economy in our lifetime.\nIn order to keep up with the growing consumer and merchant demand for Bitcoin, we must scale. And in order to do that, we are pleased to announce that today we have secured a series B funding round totaling $25M, led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from existing investors Union Square Ventures and Ribbit Capital. With this funding, Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s Chris Dixon will join our board, along with Union Square Ventures\u2019 Fred Wilson.\nThis investment represents the largest fundraise in Bitcoin to date (bringing our total raised to $31M). \u00a0We see it as a key moment to show the opportunity of Bitcoin and the dramatic impact it will have on the global economy.\nAnd we aren\u2019t alone in that thinking. As Chris Dixon writes today\u00a0on this blog,\u00a0The designers of the Web built placeholders for a system that moved money, but never successfully completed it. Bitcoin is the first plausible proposal for an economic protocol for the Internet.\nThis funding solidifies our position as the largest and fastest growing Bitcoin service in the U.S. We plan to use the funds to expand our team, continue to educate the market, and promote the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. We\u2019ll also expand our\u00a0referral program, where you can give and get $5 in bitcoin for free when you refer a friend who buys or sells at least $100 of bitcoin.\nSeparately, we\u2019re also very pleased to share that Gavin Andresen has joined Coinbase as an advisor. For those of you who don\u2019t know him, Gavin is the head developer of Bitcoin as an open source software project. He said:\nCoinbase has become a critical piece of the Bitcoin infrastructure in the U.S., giving people a trustworthy and easy way to buy, sell, trade and store bitcoins. The best part of my job as Chief Scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation is interacting with the brilliant people at Coinbase and other startups all over the world who are working hard to make Bitcoin accessible to everybody.\nCoinbase is the only company that touches the three most important points of the Bitcoin ecosystem: consumers, merchants, and developers. We are averaging 10,000 new customer sign-ups a day, and are now working with over 16,000 merchants including OkCupid, Khan Academy, and Reddit, who use Coinbase to accept bitcoin. We are making it easier for consumers to buy, merchants to sell, and developers to build, and we can\u2019t wait for our next chapter.\nWe think it\u2019s going to be an exciting one!\n\u00a0\nAndreessen Horowitz take on Coinbase:\nA neon sign sits on the floor of Coinbase\u2019s loft-style office in \u00a0San Francisco. The curving orange and white tubes depict the distinctive B-symbol for the digital currency bitcoin, with the words \u201cAccepted Here\u201d beneath it.\nThe joke, of course, is that the sign is reminiscent of something that could be a regular part of the landscape, as commonplace as any \u201cBud\u201d sign. And bitcoin at present is anything but commonplace.\nBut that is where Coinbase comes in, say co-founders Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, as the mechanism to take bitcoin out of the hackers and nerds-only realm. The plan is to make using the digital currency so easy and so routine, you\u2019ll soon use it for every transaction, from buying electronics to paying your rent, even the next round of beers.\nIn very simple terms, Coinbase offers a service \u2013 really a layer that runs on top of the bitcoin protocol \u2013 that makes securely buying, storing and spending bitcoin no more complicated than executing a trade or transfer within most online investment accounts. Coinbase is designed to enable consumers with their bitcoin \u201cwallets\u201d to buy from a growing number of merchants and service providers working with Coinbase that accept bitcoin as payment.\nMuch has been made in recent months about bitcoin going \u201cmainstream,\u201d but it is hardly that. What it has been is primarily a speculative investment for a group of early adopters. Their number has been growing as the price of a single bitcoin has been on a somewhat bumpy rocket ride in the last year, from about $15 to as high as $1,200 per bitcoin.\n\u201cThe rising value of bitcoin is driving interest and incredible awareness, but that is not the most interesting thing to us,\u201d says Armstrong. \u201cIt\u2019s this next phase on which we are focused, which is actually using it as a payment network. And we are starting to see signs that it is beginning.\u201d\nIndeed it wasn\u2019t the speculative aspect of the digital currency, but Bitcoin\u2019s advantages as a payment network that got Armstrong and Ehrsam (who coincidentally both studied computer science and economics on college) hooked on the digital currency in the first place. When you meet the two it makes perfect sense. The duo isn\u2019t your stereotypical hoody wearing entrepreneurs. There is no other way to describe their vibe than \u201cbankerly,\u201d pressed shirts (tucked in no less) nice shoes, the whole nine-yards.\nArmstrong was working on international fraud prevention in 2010 at Airbnb, when he read a paper on Bitcoin. \u201cI got really excited about the potential,\u201d Armstrong says. \u201cThis was the first open payment network for the whole world, but it was just way too difficult to use.\u201d Indeed, unless you had a background in cryptography or a knack with building your own computer rig to \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin, it was out of bounds for almost everyone.\nWhile Armstrong was pondering Bitcoin\u2019s advantages and barriers, Ehrsam was a young foreign exchange trader at Goldman Sachs. He too started poking around in the digital currency.\n\u201cOne thing that trading foreign exchange at an institutional level made me acutely aware of is it really not a democratic process,\u201d Ehrsam says.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult for high-net worth individuals or hedge funds to transfer from one currency to another, but when you think of the average person who needs to send money back to their family outside the United States it\u2019s a very opaque marketplace, and the fees are significantly, significantly higher.\u201d With Bitcoin, with its decentralized structure and no third party sitting in the middle of the transaction, the cost of sending the digital currency is the same as sending any data \u2013 virtually zero.\nEhrsam extended that advantage not just to the remittances, but also to say the razor-thin margins of the electronics business. Rather than paying the typical 2 percent-plus in interchange fees, a retailer that accepted bitcoin might get that down another percentage point or more.\u00a0 \u201cAll of the sudden you can raise the profit on a given electronics purchase by at least 50%,\u201d Ehrsam says.\nIt took more than a year of long-distance discussion, but after finding common ground around bitcoin, and realizing they made a good team, Ehrsam headed out to San Francisco to start building what would become Coinbase with Armstrong. They tackled the problems Armstrong saw \u2013 hard to acquire and spend Bitcoin \u2013 and leveraged the potential upon which both were focused.\nNow 18 months after launch, Coinbase has\u00a0 600,000 consumer wallets on the platform, 16,000 merchants and 3,000 developers building apps to offer a variety of bitcoin-based services. Users are growing at 31% month over month, and the people signing up come from all over the country. The number of women signing up for bitcoin wallets has grown 50 percent in the last six months alone.\nAll of which is to say bitcoin, with Coinbase in lock-step, might indeed be starting its next phase, away from the speculative and toward the transactional \u2013 even the commonplace. There is much still to be done. Regulations to hammer out, a public that needs to wrap its head around trusting what amounts to an opensource, math-based currency \u2013 rather than something that is backed by a government.\n\u201cThis is the web in 1995, this is the Wild West right now,\u201d Armstrong says. \u201cBut we will get the regulation, and we will get the trust.\u00a0 It will happen because the entire world is moving toward this, and we will have to adapt.\u201d Which is exactly where Coinbase hopes to help, as the trusted guide through this new world of digital currency. Just follow the neon sign.\n\u00a0\n", "category": "News"}

As the name suggests, that innovation is improved anonymity.\nYesterday I had a conversation with Meeh, Anoncoin\u2019s lead developer. Also on the team are K1773R, who prefers programming and security concerns to media enquiries, BroTroxer the project manager and infrastructure guy, JackOfAll who handles PR and community issues and Gnosis, whose focus is cryptography and Anoncoin\u2019s implementation of the Zerocoin protocol.\nSo, Anoncoin\u2026 Is it related to hacktivist / meme appreciation group, Anonymous? Meeh says, \u201cno.\u201d Of course, members of Anonymous could be using it. So could top Scientologists, paying to level up their wizard powers. The whole point is that nobody knows who is using it.\nMeeh told me Anoncoin, ticker symbol ANC, began as a Litecoin fork around the time the ASICs were coming online in mid-2013. Only 4.2 ANC will issued in total. Litecoin\u2019s scrypt basis was chosen to give the average user a chance against the industrial-scale ASIC mining ops which have since come to dominate Bitcoin\u2019s sha256 infrastructure. In fact, this philosophy of giving the little guy an edge over the big boys seems to be Anoncoin\u2019s reason for existence. Like many involved in cryptocurrency, Meeh is no fan of central banks. With historical justification, he categorises them as war profiteers and seems to regard them as vaguely threatening goliaths.\nBIS, the central bank of central banks.\nMeeh warns that central bankers are likely to become increasingly adversarial to cryptocurrency as it erodes their control over the world\u2019s money. Personally, I agree with this assessment. Expecting centralised institutions to surrender their supreme monetary power to upstart cryptocurrencies is na\u00efve, at best. However, as Meeh points out, the form which central banking\u2019s reaction will take is unknown. A likely channel is increased regulatory pressure on all crypto market participants; registration requirements enabling taxation and potential restrictions. As any coinspend over the open internet can be traced to your computer\u2019s unique IP address, the likely means by which \u201cthe authorities\u201d might persecute cryptocurrency users is clear.Anticipating a day when this becomes problematic, Anoncoin offers its users the anonymising protection of the darknet.\nThe best-known \u201cdarknet\u201d is, of course, Tor; the IP-obscuring network which enabled the notorious Silk Road bazaar to openly defy government substance prohibitions for years. Tor obscures a user\u2019s IP by routing their connection through a series of hops; an initial entry server accepts a user\u2019s datastream and channels it to a relay server. This relay server routes the data (now seen as coming from the entry server\u2019s IP address) to an exit server. The exit server then connects the user with the relevant clearnet (meaning unencrypted, regular internet) or Tor-exclusive \u201c.onion\u201d site. All data is encrypted en route, such that entries and relays can\u2019t read the content. An exit server can potentially monitor what sites are being viewed but \u2013 critically \u2013 not by whom.\n\nInterestingly, Meeh tells me that, due to support for proxy mode being a feature of Bitcoin\u2019s original design, it\u2019s possible to configure any cryptocurrency to work via Tor. As far as he knows though, only Anoncoin offers blockchain-broadcasting .onion nodes. These allow ANC clients to restrict their traffic entirely to Tor. Although Tor is believed to be generally secure, Anoncoin doesn\u2019t place all its eggs in one basket.\nSupport for I2P, another anonymising network, is standard in Anoncoin. I2P works in a similar manner to Tor, albeit with some improvements like further layer of encryption, but has the drawback that access to regular clearnet websites is extremely slow. As such, I2P is more of a self-contained network or \u201cinternal internet,\u201d where participants are mostly confined to \u201ceepSites.\u201d Unlike Tor, which strives to preserve its bandwidth for censorship evasion, political activism and even military usage, peer-to-peer file-sharing is encouraged within the I2P network. Although slower than regular torrents, the built-in I2Psnark client is great for sharing files without being hit with nastygrams from your ISP. And now, thanks to Anoncoin, I2P is also an anonymous way to keep your cryptocurrency wallet synced up and trading digital cash.  It should be stated that neither Tor nor I2P are essential to running the Anoncoin client. The client will sync with and broadcast to any combination of clearnet, Tor or I2P. At this point in the interview, Meeh mentions that Anoncoin is based on a largely unknown and unofficial patch for Bitcoin, which allows it to run through I2P. Meeh states that he wishes to bring the developer of that patch onboard the I2P project, or at least send some Bitcoin his way for his pioneering work.\nWe move to the future of Anoncoin. The next update will implement of Coin Control. This feature, also promised for Bitcoin and other cryptos, is essentially a fix for the quirky way in which coins are sent. Simply put, Coin Control conveys privacy benefits by allowing users to select which of their wallet addresses will send coins, rather than the client selecting coins. In many instances, an address you\u2019d rather keep private will become linked to a more public address by the standard wallet\u2019s shenanigans.\nSo, with your IP address safely hidden and control over inadvertent address linkages, all that remains to truly anonymise cryptocurrency is the small matter of the permanent, time-stamped record of every transaction by address: the blockchain, which forms the backbone of all peer-to-peer currency. Already forensic analysis of the blockchain can reveal a surprising depth of information on the holdings and transactions of Satoshi Nakomoto, not to mention other high-profile heroes (and villains) of the crypto world. The proposed solution to this is Zerocoin. I\u2019m still wrapping my head around how Zerocoin will function but it sounds very promising. I ask Meeh if we\u2019ll be able to send our ANC into the Zerocoin \u2018pool\u2019 then pull out some different, random ANC? He agrees that, \u201cin simple untechnical terms,\u201d this is how it\u2019ll work.\n\nSo, Zerocoin can be thought of as a built-in, no trust coin-mixing service. Right now, the Anoncoin team are deciding on a sensible exchange rate between Anoncoin and Zerocoin, and what percentage of Anoncoin block rewards will be paid out in Zerocoin \u2013 given the latter will be incorporated as an additional part of the ANC blockchain. In fact, Zerocoin was initially developed as an addition to Bitcoin. For whatever reason, perhaps caution against adding complex new features by the developers, or perhaps privacy being lower on their agenda than mainstream / regulatory acceptance, it seems unlikely the Bitcoin will adopt Zerocoin into its protocol any time soon.\nThis opens the door for Anoncoin, likely the first altcoin to integrate Zerocoin, to become the preferred coin for those who value their financial privacy. Let\u2019s face it; such a privilege has long been lost to users of credit cards, electronic banking, wire services, PayPal or anything that isn\u2019t cash, barter or carefully-deployed cryptocurrency. Anoncoin is shaping up to be the complete privacy package. I suspect it will function as a great testbed for anonymity features, as well as having a bright future of its own.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

Penney whenever they enter a store location. \u00a0In fact, everything that I described in the previous paragraph can happen without Apple. \u00a0In fact, iBeacon is only used in Apple Stores right now because those that peruse Apple Stores are likely to already have an Apple product, and an affinity for giving up privacy rights for ease of use.\nQualcomm, like Estimote, is also launching an NFC device that works with LE Bluetooth and competes directly with the iBeacon, with one notable difference: functionality on Android devices. \u00a0The picture being painted should be getting clearer, this NFC technology being developed by Apple and the rest of the world\u00a0isn\u2019t yet a payment system; however, it is the infrastructure for a payment system. \u00a0This infrastructure being disseminated by Apple, and the underlying LE Bluetooth technology being pursued by many more companies, might have long-lasting effects on basic consumer interaction design for the average consumer\u2019s retail experience; however, a revolutionary payments system it is not.\n\u00a0\nOn to Bitcoin, which is actually a revolutionary payments system!\nBitcoin already has an established infrastructure for its payment system. \u00a0This infrastructure has been in place longer than Bitcoin\u2019s existence and in fact, every internet-enabled Apple device\u00a0since the 1990s\u00a0(not just the iPhone 4s or 3rd gen iPad) can access and be a part of this infrastructure. \u00a0Of course, I am talking about the Internet. \u00a0As of 2013,\u00a0Cisco believes that there are over 8.7 billion internet enabled devices\u00a0in the world, which means there are over 8.7 billion potential \u201cBitcoin beacons\u201d. \u00a0Obviously, only a portion of the 8.7 billion internet enabled devices are capable of running a full Bitcoin node; however, the vast majority of them are undoubtedly able to operate a light-weight client. \u00a0Also, since Bitcoin can be sent by SMS, the true amount of \u201cBitcoin-enabled\u201d devices is actually in the\u00a0tens of billions. \u00a0250 million iBeacon,\u00a0and maybe iPayments, enabled devices by 2014 doesn\u2019t even seem significant anymore does it.\nI know that any infrastructure that Apple sets up in their attempt to move on the P2P payments network can be used for Bitcoin as well. \u00a0On that note, it should be readily apparent why Apple has taken out key Bitcoin functionality from most Bitcoin apps in their iOS App Store.\u00a0\u00a0Gliph\u00a0and\u00a0Coinbase\u00a0are the two most recent casualties of Apple\u2019s anti-Bitcoin Terms of Service. \u00a0Despite Apple\u2019s best efforts to keep Bitcoin-enabled Apps out of its App Store, Bitcoiners will always be able to access Gliph and Coinbase\u2019s services through an Apple sanctioned web browser such as Safari.\nI look forward to seeing what LE Bluetooth does for my personal shopping experience, but seeing as how Apple technology has consistently been too under-performing and over-priced i will likely never have an iBeacon enabled device. \u00a0Actually, I don\u2019t think I would want to give up that much privacy for any perks they could conceivably offer me. \u00a0However, the inconceivable \u201cperks\u201d are exactly what developments in technology will lead to. \u00a0I believe that iBeacon, and other LE Bluetooth devices, will start tying digital data to physical locations/stores in cost-efficient ways: I just needed to point out that there is\u00a0nothing\u00a0in the sphere of payments that Apple, Qualcomm, Estimote, or even Google can do that Bitcoin can\u2019t do better.", "category": "Bitcoin Business"}

From their statement it looks like Wayi wants to take it one step further and establish the first Taiwan Bitcoin Exchange.\n\u00a0\nTaiwan News: \u00a0Talk of the Day \u2014 Bitcoin to be introduced in Taiwan\n\u201cWayi International Digital Entertainment Co. announced Wednesday that its online shopping site Wmall will begin to accept Bitcoin payments next year. The OTC (over-the-counter) market-listed company, which focuses on the research, development and distribution of online games, will be the first Taiwanese company to accept the decentralized virtual currency as a payment tool.\nFinancial analysts said Wayi\u2019s decision will test the Central Bank of the Republic of\u00a0China\u2018s (CBC\u2019s) attitude toward Bitcoin development in Taiwan and its ability to regulate the currency\u2019s circulation. CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan said recently that the central bank has been keeping close tabs on the development of Bitcoin, a new kind of money circulating among a specific group of people.\nSome see Bitcoin as a digital commodity while others view it as a digital currency. It is run in a decentralized peer-to-peer network without a central authority or banks to manage transactions. Cryptography is used to control transactions and prevent double-spending. The issuing of Bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. The concept was introduced in a 2008 paper by a pseudonymous developer known as \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto,\u201d according to Wikipedia. The following are excerpts from a special report in the Wednesday edition of the United Evening News: Wayi said it will not only accept Bitcoin payments for its online shopping services but is also looking forward to becoming Taiwan\u2019s Bitcoin exchange center. The announcement pushed the company\u2019s share prices up by the daily maximum 7 percent to close at NT$10.45 (US$0.35) Wednesday. The price was above the stock\u2019s monthly and quarterly moving averages. Wayi said the company does not have any Bitcoin at present but is working to connect with Bitpay, an Atlanta-based company that helps companies accept Bitcoin as payment, to verify the legality of Bitcoin owned by consumers. Starting next year, Wmall will accept Bitcoin from consumers who buy products or services on its website. Once the company accumulates a tranche of Bitcoin, consumers will also be able to buy Bitcoin on its website, a Wayi spokesman said. The company will collect a 3 percent service charge from those who procure Bitcoin through Wmall circulation system, he added. Bitcoin can be cashed into the local currency through digital exchange centers.\nLocal financial analysts said they do not think that Wayi would become a major Bitcoin exchange center because few Taiwanese people have the currency and the Bitcoin bubble is likely to burst.\nBitcoin first appeared in 2009 and has become increasingly popular as a payment tool.\nThe Germany government recognized Bitcoin as a legal currency in August, allowing Germans to use it for tax payments and trading.\nBut\u00a0China\u00a0announced Dec. 6 that its financial institutions are banned from pricing physical goods or services in Bitcoin.\nChinese institutions are also not allowed to accept Bitcoin as a currency or use it for financial services or investment.\u00a0China\u2018s insurance companies are not permitted to provide coverage for Bitcoin-related problems. Taiwan\u2019s central bank said recently that it views Bitcoin trading the same way it views trade in precious metals. The central bank said it is keeping track of changes in the development of Bitcoin and will prevent money laundering using the digital currency. (Dec. 11, 2013).

I\u2019m either lucky or good (probably the former) as this is pretty much what happened. Bitcoin price bounced from the ~$700 / 50% retracement level and is currently balanced between the ~$900 / 23.6% and ~$820 / 38.2% retracement levels.\nAs of the time of writing (Saturday the 14th), we\u2019ve had 3 days of light trading and low volatility, as signified by the short price candles and volume bars. After the tremendous volatility of the \u201cChinese bull run,\u201d where price ranged $200 \u2013 $400 some days, it\u2019s natural for the market to take a breather. All markets cycle between low and high volatility phases; dealing with the boredom of \u201csideways\u201d is as much a skill as keeping your objectivity during steep trends.\nWhat\u2019s nice about low volatility markets is you get a tighter spread \u2013 the difference between the bid and ask price. The slowness also minimises your slippage, or the difference between the Bitcoin price you want and the Bitcoin price you get. If you\u2019ve ever put in a limit order only to see price shoot past your specified price, forcing you to buy higher \u201cat market,\u201d you\u2019ll get how slippage costs can add up. If you have a strong view of where price is headed, now might be the smart time to take a position \u2013 with proper stop-losses and targets in place, of course. I\u2019ll cover how to set sensible stops and targets next time.\nAnyway, right now it seems that buyers and sellers on Gox are more or less in agreement that 1 Bitcoin is worth about $900 \u2013 $950. Now we wait for something to unbalance this agreement, maybe some big news or big volume entering the market. In regular markets, Christmas holidays are usually a low volume lull where not much happens, but we shouldn\u2019t assume the same will hold true of Bitcoin. After all, the Chinese have been major market-movers and they don\u2019t celebrate Western holidays. And speaking of East Asia, now we hear Taiwan is getting an exchange\u2026\nGetting back to the Bitcoin price chart, it\u2019s interesting to note that it bounced off the ~$700 / 50% level; suggesting that to be a key level to watch in future. The rule of thumb is that the more times price responds to a certain level (or trendline), the higher the level / line\u2019s significance. This is a big part of my trading strategy; seeing how price behaves at key points before taking the according position. For example, if we see a close below that $700 confluence of recent low and 50% retracment, that\u2019d be pretty concerning for bulls. Likewise a close above that ~$1250 high, which caps the double top, would be a clear signal for bears to cover their shorts.\nAlso visible in the chart are the default BitcoinWisdom 7 and 30 day simple moving averages. Although you can alter them when charting the latest Bitcoin price, I recommend sticking with these default values. Reason being, lots of people watch Bitcoin Wisdom but (probably) not many change the settings. The more eyes on an indicator, the more likely it is to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. And as we can see here, the Bitcoin price seems to be reacting to that 30 day MA. After a brief break below, it\u2019s now resting on it.\nWe also nearly got a MA cross sell signal; this when a short-term MA crosses a long-term MA. Still, in the absence of other technical signals, sentiment shifts or new market information, I wouldn\u2019t consider a MA cross, to either the up or down-side, to be an actionable signal here.\nOK so going forward, anything can happen as always. Personally I expect a bit more nothing-much for a while. Some more base-building around this level would in fact be welcome, to fuel the next leg up. My big picture take on Bitcoin price remains that we\u2019re headed higher medium term. Maybe $3000 in 2014 if Bitcoin adoption and coverage continues in a positive direction.\nUS Dollars will buy a lot more Rupees since April 2013.\nOne thing I\u2019m watching as a cue for the next moonshot is the successful creation of an Indian exchange. The Rupee has lost 10% or more value this year, and the Indian govt. is restricting access to gold, the people\u2019s traditional store of wealth. With a functional exchange and favourable media coverage / word-of-mouth, Bitcoin could soon experience major demand from India, for both speculative and wealth preservation purposes. And once Indians realise Bitcoin\u2019s value for remittance purposes or their import-export market, that\u2019s a whole lot of people to boost the adoption rate.\n\u00a0\nThis is a part of the Cryptocurrency Investment Club by CryptoCoinsNews.com.\nJoin our FREE and EXCLUSIVE Cryptocurrency Investment Club!

The company says it will take a commission of less than 1 percent.\nAny business that plans to be international in scope\u00a0and\u00a0legal compliance has many hurdles in front of them, so it\u2019s a good thing Buttercoin has international support. \u00a0However, from this small case study we can appreciate the inherent difficulty in establishing an international remittance network. \u00a0Buttercoin is currently in the mire of regulatory hurdles and it may be a while before we see a functioning Bitcoin International remittance system of any sort. \u00a0However, the demand for international remittance transfers at less than 1% commission is very large in our current world where the current international remittance commission fee is an average of around 9%.\n\nDomestic remittances, sooner than International remittances, will highlight Bitcoin\u2019s superiority as a medium of exhcnage\nDomestic Remittances\nAccording to the UN, there are about 3.5x the amount of migrant workers that have migrated within their country of birth than workers that have migrated outside of their country of birth. \u00a0The aggregate amount of domestic remittances far outweighs that of international remittances. \u00a0\nAs of 2011, in India, domestic remittances are more than double that of international remittances, meaning that domestic remittances in India total over $100 billion USD per year. \u00a0Compare that with the $3.4 billion USD market that Buttercoin is facing.\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, where the fees for both international and domestic remittance transfers are the highest in the world, domestic remittances are 8 times more prevalent than international remittances.\nThere is a wealth of data demonstrating the demand for more efficient domestic remittance methods. \u00a0I will focus on domestic and international remittances in China as those are the areas in which I have academic training and personal experience, respectively.\nIn a 2005 study by Chong and Zhong, the aggregate amount of domestic remittances was found to be much larger than the amount of international remittances. \u00a0This comes as no surprise given the floating migrant worker population in China that numbers more than 100 million. \u00a0The total of domestic remittances in 2005 was larger than that of international remittances in that same year. \u00a0 The data for recent years is not as readily available but extrapolation can be done on the growing not shrinking size of China\u2019s migrant worker population.\nMigrant workers within China were found to use a combination of the China postal service, commercial banks, and rural credit cooperatives to remit their money, totally over $30 Billion USD, back home. \u00a0In recent years since the article though, commercial banks have been closing their rural branches due to changes in regulation. \u00a0This and other factors such as a intimidation by and/or unwillingness to participate in formal settings, forms, and procedures serve as an obstacle preventing the older, less educated, and poorer from knowing about or utilizing these formal forms of remittance. \u00a0Instead, as little as 25%, but likely much more, of remittance money is sent through informal means, such as having a trusted friend visiting the village to carry the cash right to the family; however, due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying how much money moves around in this manner one must realize that the grand total of domestic remittances in any region or country is systemically underestimated.\nThe average per transaction fee for domestic remittances in China sits at around 1 to 1.5%; similarly, Wells Fargo charges $15 for a $500 to $1000 transfer from America to China which makes their fee 1.5% at best. \u00a0The fact of the matter is, 1 to 1.5% of the meager remittances that migrant workers are able to scrounge about to send home, is often 30 to 50 yuan, otherwise known as their monthly food allowance. \u00a0Even in China, with some of the lowest domestic remittance fees in the world, the demand for lower fees is still as strong as hunger pains; just imagine the potential in Africa.\nThe Path of the Future\nWith this knowledge in hand we are now able to identify the largest obstacles to Bitcoin, in relation to exchange use, are internet penetration and bank account penetration. \u00a0Access to the internet and having a bank account both are currently required to participate in the Bitcoin economy if the bitcoins need to be converted to a native currency for use purposes or for accounting purposes. \u00a0The reality is that Bitcoin is, as of yet, not poised to make even a small impact on the International Remittances market due to the lack of bank account penetration in the countries that would benefit most.\nIn developed countries such as the United States, almost 90% of all adults have a bank account, and also internet access. \u00a0In certain countries in Africa the bank account penetration rate is barely in the double digits; furthermore, there is an increased gap in bank account penetration between the top 20% richest and the 20% poorest in each country. \u00a0The lack of financial institutions of any sort are part of the reason why these poor areas stay poor, as there isn\u2019t infrastructure to provide loans to reinvest in the community or even to provide basic savings functions.\nAcross the world, more promising data for the financial future via Bitcoin is provided by studies about internet penetration. \u00a0In China, there is a large and obvious gap between the number of urban Chinese internet users and the number of rural Chinese internet users. \u00a0However, compared with their urban counterparts, rural Chinese internet users under the age of 19 are using proportionally more internet than their urban counterparts. \u00a0This supports the trend that all have undoubtedly observed: Internet penetration is increasing, partly due to the onset of 3G and mobile phones, and this phenomenon is occurring even in Africa. \u00a0More importantly, we are faced with the fact that internet penetration growth is far outpacing bank account penetration growth.\nWe may soon find ourselves in a world where Bitcoin and other cryptocoins are the best \u201cbank account\u201d that someone in a third world country could conceivably own or have steady access to.\nA single trusted domestic exchange is all that is necessary to utilize Bitcoin as a medium of exchange for domestic remittance transfers.\nThis exchange could be centralized or decentralized, compliant or non-compliant; however, it is much more plausible that said exchange would reach its status as trusted domestic exchange if they were centralized and legally compliant.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

Furthermore, many of those who knew about Bitcoin still weren\u2019t sure about how it can be used.\nTake Olga Ruff, for instance. Ruff is a 62 year old woman from Dallas, Texas who knows the definition of Bitcoin. But beyond that, she\u2019s really unsure of what to make of the whole Bitcoin scene.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what the value of it is, and what I\u2019d be able to exchange it for\u2026What use would it be for me?\u201d\nRuff is the owner of a small jewellery business, and is unlikely to begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment.\nAnother respondent, Jeremy Labadie, is a 32 year old from New York.

However,\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily know if it\u2019s something I would think about using to make purchases.\u201d\nLabadie and Ruff represent some of the most knowledgeable about Bitcoin. Many others were completely clueless. Amusingly, 6% of respondents thought that Bitcoin was an Xbox game while another 6% thought that it was an iOS app.\nNo, Patrick. Bitcoin is not an instrument. Litecoin is not an instrument either.\nIt\u2019s really not all that surprising that most Americans don\u2019t know or understand Bitcoin. The virtual currency has only recently become a hot topic in mainstream news. Furthermore, most Bitcoin-related news in mainstream media is overwhelmingly negative as it focuses on crime such as the Silk Road shutdown. As a result, most who have heard of Bitcoin think of it as an illegal money-laundering/ponzi/pyramid scheme.\nFor instance, 62 year old John Berg from Minnesota heard about Bitcoin through crime news.\n\u201cThere was someone who was using it for something illegal, and it took the FBI a long time to sort it out.\u201d", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

{"title": "How to Get a Custom Bitcoin Address", "url": "https://www.ccn.com/get-custom-bitcoin-address/", "birthday": "2013-12-14T00:55:03+00:00", "date": "2013-12-14 00:55:03", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 14, "content": "Bitcoin address tend to be random and cryptic. Ever wished you could have a more personalised Bitcoin address? Well, you can. I made myself a custom address (or vanity address) recently, and some of my friends have wondered how to do this, so I decided to write up a guide for everyone. (This is my address:\u00a01NeiL1eBshdVaKRn4SVeeK4qT6bL9tSePu).\nThere are a couple of ways to get these vanity addresses.\nTHE LAZY WAY\nPros \u2013 very easy\nCons \u2013 may not be secure, may not be free\nCustom Bitcoin Address\nWebsites such as BitcoinVanity\u00a0will let you generate a custom prefix right in your browser. While this is incredibly convenient, you have to trust websites like these to not save your private keys. Furthermore, online vanity address generators may charge a fee, depending on the length of the prefix. If you feel that you can trust such an online service and have no issue paying for a custom Bitcoin address, then go ahead. But if you\u2019d rather put in a bit of extra effort to get a FREE and SECURE address, read on.\nTHE BETTER/HARDER WAY\nPros \u2013 you have total control, free, secure\nCons \u2013 speed depends on the computer you use, harder\nBefore we continue, let\u2019s take a moment to understand how Bitcoin addresses work. Bitcoin addresses are randomly generated and have a unique \u201cprivate key\u201d attached to them. The private key is required to access the BTC associated with a particular Bitcoin address. Since addresses are randomly generated, it\u2019s possible to brute-force one\u2019s way to obtaining a particular address. This is what we\u2019ll be doing.\nWe\u2019ll be using a program called Vanitygen, which will do the brute-forcing for us. This guide is written for Windows users since Windows binaries are available for Vanitygen. It IS possible to compile Vanitygen from source on OSX or Linux, but this is quite the hassle. I\u2019m a Mac person, so I actually took the time to get Vanitygen working on my Mac, but it really wasn\u2019t worth it. It was way too much effort when I could\u2019ve just borrowed someone\u2019s PC. If you don\u2019t have any Windows computers at home, just borrow your friend\u2019s computer as that\u2019ll be much easier than getting Vanitygen to work on OSX or Linux.\nAnyway, moving on. Start by downloading Vanitygen for Windows here. Extract the .zip file someplace convenient such as your desktop. Open the folder. You should see this.\n\nNotice that there are 5 different choices. oclvanitygen uses an OpenCL-compatible GPU to generate vanity addresses. If you\u2019ve got a relatively new ATI/AMD graphics card, you can use oclvanitygen. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to use vanitygen or vanitygen64, which will use your CPU to generate addresses. Similar to mining Bitcoin, using your GPU will be significantly faster than using your CPU, so oclvanitygen is recommended. However, with short prefixes like 1NeiL, CPU vanitygen will work just fine. You can ignore oclvanityminer and oclvanityminer64.\nNext, open up a new command prompt window. Go to Start>Run and type in \u201ccmd\u201d without quotes. Hit \u201cOK\u201d.\n\nYou should now see a window like this.\n\nThe next step is to type in the location of the vanitygen you\u2019re using. In Windows 7 onwards, you can just drag the vanitygen exe onto the cmd window, and the path will automatically be typed for you. Here I will be using vanitygen64.exe because I\u2019m on a laptop with a 64 bit CPU, but no OpenCL GPU.\n\nHit enter. You should see a lot of text explaining all the options vanitygen offers.\n\nWe\u2019ll be using -v and -i in this guide. Let\u2019s get vanitygen going again, but this time with the appropriate options.\n\nNotice how this is done. I dragged vanitygen64.exe onto the cmd window and hit the spacebar. Next, I typed -v, space, -i, space, 1test. The -v option will give me a verbose (wordy) output. The -i option will make my prefix case-insensitive to speed things up. Without -i, the prefix will be case-sensitive, which would be slower. Finally, I typed \u201c1test\u201d. The Bitcoin address that I generate will begin with this prefix. Keep in mind that all Bitcoin addresses start with the number 1, so having the 1 as the first character is essential. For your prefix, you can type \u201c1test\u201d, \u201c1billybob\u201d, or whatever. Just keep in mind that the longer the prefix, the longer it will take to generate your custom address.\nEverything looks good. Hit enter.\n\nAaaand it\u2019s working! Vanitygen is brute-forcing its way to generating a Bitcoin address that begins with \u201c1test\u201d (case-insensitive). 306.15 Kkey/s is the speed at which Vanitygen is working on my computer. (This is pretty slow since I\u2019m on an old Windows laptop using CPU Vanitygen). \u201cProb 12.3%\u201d means that there is a 12.3% chance of stumbling upon the vanity address I want at that particular instant. The probability of getting my custom address will be 50% in 30.3 seconds. These are just calculated guesses, so don\u2019t think too much of them. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll get your address before the Prob hits 100%. If you\u2019re unlucky, you\u2019ll get your address after 100%. Usually however, you\u2019ll get your address sometime between 95% \u2013 100% Prob. This step could be really fast or really slow depending on your computer\u2019s speed and the length of your prefix.\nAbout a minute later\u2026SUCCESS!\n\nAt the bottom, you see \u2013\nAddress: 1tesTJj3YHugNNV7XPX48erjTJxrWqg27\nPrivkey: 5JQpN6eLrsUD2wce4eKQmEczC2gGRy1dBaCjxf6xSFEHm1oiu8D\nThere\u2019s the address and the private key associated with it! To use the custom address, all you need to do is import the private key to your Bitcoin wallet.\nNow,\u00a01tesTJj3YHugNNV7XPX48erjTJxrWqg27 isn\u2019t exactly the coolest address, but this was just an example. I\u2019m sure you can think of something much better for your own personalised address. You can use your name, a phrase, a word, anything. Be creative. Just keep in mind that the shorter your prefix is, the faster it\u2019ll be generated.", "category": "Altcoin Mining"}

Without any real big events that can explain the sudden Bitcoin-price drop of more than 15%, we will still try and give you a few pointers that may have caused the shift.\nThe Bitcoin value rose from being stable around 150 USD per Bitcoin this summer, to more than 1200 USD per Bitcoin within just a few months. The largest increase happened during October and November. This \u201cpump\u201d or \u201chype\u201d (I would rather see a more sustainable price growth \u2013 not a hockey stick) was mainly caused by BTC China and the expanding interest of Bitcoins in China.\nBut why is Bitcoin falling then?\nAs we have written in our earlier posts, a lot has happened to the Bitcoin-field in the past weeks. There has been a shift in the market going from \u201cBitcoin is very bullish and can grow infinite\u201d to a state of fear of what governments might do to Bitcoin. I believe that this shift has happened due to the climate change in China. As Jesus Cripto writes:\nBTC China has, after 3 successful months, has decided to resume trading fees. \u00a0For a few weeks now, because of 0% trading fees, BTC China has consistently been the highest volume BTC exchange. \u00a0Trading fees will be 0.3%, the announcement reads:\nDear BTC China valued customer: To stabilize the recent turbulent Bitcoin market and minimize potential market manipulation, BTC China will end the 0% trading fee promotion, effective immediately, and revert to the 0.3% trading fee. We deeply apologize for the sudden change. BTC China, December 16, 2013\nSince the People\u2019s Bank of China \u201cbanned\u201d real-life merchants and banks from handling Bitcoin, Baidu\u2019s Jiasule has stopped accepting Bitcoin and some argued that Bitcoin\u2019s first Chinese bubble had popped. Some may have noticed that BTC China requires ID or Passport Number now for all its users as well, this is another side effect of China\u2019s bank\u2019s statement.\nAnd as Blowstamps tells us:\nAnyone who lives life watching bitcoin market charts woke up Monday with a kick to the groin.\u00a0 Within a single hour the price of 1BTC crashed to below $800, and continued down to below $700 a few hours after that.\u00a0 In the wee-hours of the morning (Eastern time) Monday, two messages appeared on a Chinese micro-blogging site.\u00a0 The messages purported to be from CEOs of payment services claiming that their companies would not be allowed to conduct transactions with any bitcoin exchange.\u00a0 Almost simultaneously the price of bitcoin plunged, and the accounts that posted the messages were deleted, leading many to believe it was an orchestrated manipulation of the price.\u00a0 However, a few hours later Coindesk reported that a source close to the Peoples Bank of China said that the bank met with the top third-party payment companies, and that, \u201cPBOC, in no uncertain terms, directed third-party payment companies not to do business with bitcoin exchanges in China.\u201d\nIn the midst of the early morning sell-off, BTC China, the nation\u2019s largest bitcoin exchange, abruptly ended its 0% trading fee promotion, claiming it was \u201cto stabilize the recent turbulent bitcoin market and minimize potential market manipulation.\u201d\u00a0 A sudden change in fee structure lead many more to believe that something big, and negative, was going on in China regarding bitcoin, feeding the selling frenzy further.\nThis Sina post explains (direct translate from Google Translate):\n\u201cThe central bank regulations third party payment institution shall not provide hosting bitcoin trading site for the trading business.\u201d Yesterday afternoon, the central bank called third-party payment companies meeting revealed the news.\n\u201cFirst Financial Daily\u201d reporters learned exclusively, December 5 issued \u201con guard against the risk of Bitcoin notice\u201d (the \u201cNotice\u201d) Following the central bank again yesterday, \u201cattack\u201d, interviews with more than 10 third-party payment companies relevant person in charge, it may not be explicitly requested to Bitcoin, Wright credits (LTC) and other trading sites offer payment and settlement business.\nIn less than two weeks time, the central bank even out \u201ctwo trick\u201d to prevent the risk of Bitcoin, and convey the spirit of the meeting is to be interpreted as \u201cdrastic\u201d Many Bitcoin insiders.\nThird-party payment \u201cthree line\u201d\nA large third-party payment company, told reporters that the participants who, yesterday morning, more than 10 third-party payment companies convened by the central bank, in Beijing held a closed-door meeting. Such persons in an interview with this reporter revealed that the meeting, Deputy Director of the settlement payment was chaired by the Secretary golden week the central bank, every company has sent 1 to 2 participants stakeholders.\n\u201cJustice Week at the beginning of the meeting made it clear that the meeting was not convened to discuss whether the companies about Bitcoin-related businesses can conduct, but to convey the attitude of senior central bank, which may not be the first third-party payment companies to bitcoin, Wright currency and other trading sites provide payment and settlement services; Secondly, for payment institutions business cooperation has occurred should be lifted, the stock of money at the latest to complete the withdrawal before the Spring Festival, the new payment services may not occur; Third, strict implementation of the December 5 the central bank issued a \u201cnotice\u201d. \u201cthese third-party payment companies told this reporter.\nThere is probably a lot of discussions about how to regulate Bitcoin going on behind closed doors, and some are probably even advocating for a full ban.\nThere is a lot of fear in the market of what governments might end up doing with cryptocurrencies which leads me to the next question:\nCan governments ban Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?\nCountries may be able to ban the use of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies (by making it illegal to use them), but this will lead to two things:\n1. A massive black market that stays unregulated and causes damage to the countries\u2019 economies (lost taxes so on)\n2. An advantage to other governments that make Bitcoin legal and finds a way to regulate it that fits both the Bitcoin-community and its nation\nI do not believe that it is very likely that we see any big nation completely ban the use of cryptocurrencies. On the other hand I am sure that we will see governments trying to regulate the different cryptocurrency markets, including Bitcoin.\nI would like to show you a typical graph of what happens with bubbles and where I think we are at the current stage (I do believe we are in a present bubble, yes):\nBitcoin Bubble Bursting?\nIn this fast paced market I believe we will see the bottom of the Bitcoin price in the end of January, then it will continue the increase to somewhere around 600 to 1200 USD before peaking at around 2000 USD in the spring of 2014 (IF there is no big negative news regarding governments \u201cbanning\u201d cryptocurrencies). Even though China has warned banks about the use of Bitcoins, they have not banned the use of Bitcoins. However, there could be reasons to believe that such a thing could happen. Right now it is the fear that drives the market.\nWe have also witnessed that other financial institutions are trying to create similar digital currencies, but those are not anyway near to compete with Bitcoin at the current stage so I have therefor ruled them out as a reason for the current Bitcoin drop.\nWhat do you believe of the future Bitcoin value?\nThis is a part of the Cryptocurrency Investment Club by CryptoCoinsNews.com.\nJoin our FREE and EXCLUSIVE Cryptocurrency Investment Club!

Almost Human\u00a0is set in the year 2048 and follows the adventures of Detective John Kennex (actor Karl Urban recently of Star Trek fame). \u00a0In a background story similar to iRobot, Kennex previously suffered from a traumatic experience with robot-kind that left him temporarily without a leg: Kennex is now a cyborg that hates robot-kind, oh the irony.\nKennex is recalled to the force after recovering and assigned to work with a DRN android, designed to be as close to human as possible, known as Dorian (actor Michael Ealy). \u00a0While working a case, the two of them are investigating a dead body when voila, they come across a nondescript silver stick that Detective Kennex immediately identifies as Bitcoin. \u00a0Android Dorian then uses his finger to presumably hack into the device and tells Kennex that there are 4,999 units of Bitcoin. \u00a0Watch the clip below, then stay for my analysis!\n\nThe device shown in this futuristic portrayal of the world is similar to the Trezor\u00a0Bitcoin Safe, being developed today. \u00a0The device shown would presumably be tied to the identity of the owner, though its exact method of identity verification is unknown, popular media chose to show that future law enforcement could \u201ccrack\u201d whatever technology is being used.\nThe security on that device might have been a fingerprint scanner, but seeing as how those aren\u2019t even fully secure in the year 2013 it is unlikely that they would be used to protect 4,999 units of Bitcoin in the year 2048. \u00a0It\u2019s more likely that a cost-effective mechanism for verifying DNA through a small sample of blood or skin from the finger will be developed in the future to provide the ultimate form of security.\nNext, Almost Human made no mention as to how much 4,999 units of Bitcoin would be worth in the future. \u00a0I\u2019m telling you loud and clear right now that in the future 4,999 Bitcoins will be a fortune the size of a country, it is much more likely that they are just talking about millibits, or even just satoshis when referencing the number 4,999. \u00a0In fact, it isn\u2019t even clear if even the android Dorian would be able to spend the Bitcoins on that shiny silver stick, maybe he was only able to read the associated public key and did a quick query of the blockchain to verify its balance.\nAll these crucial elements to Bitcoin have been portrayed by mainstream media just in this short clip.\nBitcoin is here to stay, even Fox thinks so. \u00a0Continue to check CryptoCoinsNews\u00a0for more updates about Bitcoin and Cryptocoins in general.", "category": "Bitcoin Videos"}

At the moment a customer buys a hamburger in the Madrid, McDonald\u2019s in reality owns Euros. \u00a0Needless to say, McDonald\u2019s is better than most at mass hamburger production, but currency speculation?\nFinancial markets have created vehicles to make transferring Euros to USD, and USD to Euros very easy for McDonald\u2019s. \u00a0The spot EUR/USD market is quoted as much in the news as any major financial index. \u00a0When someone travels between the US and Europe, many times the currency exchange rate is a topic of discussion. \u00a0So when McDonald\u2019s sells a hamburger in Euros, they can easily find an investor looking to convert USD into EUR. \u00a0Don\u2019t want to dig too deep into the textbook part, but understand that futures and options markets on this currency rate have developed which are more specific tools offered to McDonald\u2019s to hedge this currency risk.\nLet\u2019s take a leap into Bitcoin, shall we? \u00a0A merchant that accepts Bitcoin is showered with all of the upfront advantages that the payment process offers. \u00a0Read more about the advantages of\u00a0Bitcoin vs Paypal. \u00a0For most merchants that accept Bitcoin, their liabilities are presently in fiat. \u00a0Without safe, stable and reliable mechanisms of transfer from Bitcoin to fiat, we are asking the merchants to be currency speculators. \u00a0Brokers around the world have developed well established \u201cexchanges\u201d that are attempting to offer this service to the merchants. \u00a0These brokers need a centralized, regulated market for their corespondents to trade. \u00a0One exchange rate for all fiat currencies against Bitcoin. \u00a0The United States has the motivation to establish this exchange.\nChina devalues their currency as a means to continue to be ultra competitive in pricing of their products to the world. \u00a0The Chinese manufactures pay their liabilities in this suppressed currency. \u00a0The supply chain in China is artificially suppressed via this manipulation. \u00a0China is a huge loser to the uptake of Bitcoin. \u00a0Considering that it is a zero sum game, many other world leaders reap the rewards if Bitcoin is adopted on a larger scale. \u00a0The better you are at manufacturing, the more your country will gain with an uptake of Bitcoin. \u00a0It is no wonder that Germany embraces Bitcoin.\u00a0 Another large figure that embraces Bitcoin is Suning Appliance who stands to gain enormously. \u00a0They supply the depressed Chinese population with electronics. \u00a0Any uptick to the Chinese purchasing power is a windfall for Suning Appliance.\nThe United States stands to gain the most from a global success of Bitcoin. \u00a0In theory, if Bitcoin was the accepted currency of the world, not only will import/export be more balanced and merit orientated, but the debt built up on the old system will be reduced in correlation to the acceptance of Bitcoin. \u00a0A quasi Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the US. \u00a0And the largest creditor is China. \u00a0Every step in the direction of Bitcoin, is one more step that the US takes escaping the endless cycle of suppression at the hands of it\u2019s largest creditor. \u00a0When the financial system almost derailed, it was the US Federal Reserve that was forced to be the \u201cbuyer of last resort\u201d of its own country\u2019s debt. \u00a0They have been devaluing the USD, ever since, to keep up with the payments by printing more USD. The reaction of the financial crisis by the US has forced other established central banks to do the same, devaluing their currencies as well.\nThis devaluation has forced owners of the fiat currencies to scramble for safety. \u00a0Gold became the vehicle to hedge this devaluation but we have hit a paradox. \u00a0As the price of gold goes higher, the incentive to mine increases. \u00a0At present pricing and difficulty, investors storing value in gold are not getting much \u201cbang for the buck\u201d. \u00a0Estimates of the market capitalization of gold is $8,487,797,102,400. \u00a0With only 5% of the world\u2019s gold mined, there is a huge supply waiting to be mined. \u00a0And China leads all nations in production of the precious metal. \u00a0We are inherently trading fiat currencies for gold, and either case lead to the hands of China.\nBitcoin destroys gold as a method of value storage, as well. \u00a0The inherent properties of gold make the physical delivery and cost of protecting it, extremely difficult. \u00a0Investors gain exposure mainly through demand receipts of the metal. \u00a0If all demand receipts were settled at once, the resulting turmoil would put the 2008 financial crisis to shame. \u00a0Bitcoin protocol allows for theoretically unlimited storage vehicles to be created, although I would argue an investor only requires enough wallets to break their wealth down to least denomination of their liabilities. \u00a0Example, for an investor in the US who has $10,000,000 in cash, could create 1,000,000,000 Bitcoin addresses each storing $.01. \u00a0The technology to store, and subsequent access to the wealth is available at a minimal cost to mass produce. \u00a0Even though each address in infinitely harder to hack into than even a bank account, the reward for such disruption is $.01. \u00a0This is the \u201cBad Guys\u201d worst nightmare since the creation of Bitcoin itself!\nAdd together the opposing demand of merchants exiting the currency game and the investors of the world seeking a more reliable and cost effective hedge to their fiat exposure, the resulting market has the disruptive capabilities greater than any financial vehicle before. \u00a0Freeing the central banks from the tyranny of the former system is a win for everyone. \u00a0Nobody bigger than the Chinese citizens.\n-TCA\n\u00a0", "category": "Bitcoin Regulation"}

Or Both?\nThe diaspora of arguments touting Bitcoin\u2019s superiority over Paypal is endless. \u00a0There are economic incentives for buyers and sellers, large and small, to use Bitcoin vs Paypal. \u00a0Simultaneously, there are still infrastructure gaps that may prevent the efficient use of Bitcoin over Paypal at this time.\nToday, I will focus on why I (me, me, me), and by extension why\u00a0you, should use Bitcoin instead of Paypal.\nCentralized Vs. Decentralized\nAny Paypal user, whether a buyer or a seller, will at some point run into issues with Paypal\u2019s centralized structure. \u00a0For instance, I am on my second Paypal account currently after my first account was frozen, and all attached cards and banks were banned from future Paypal use. \u00a0I had to create an entirely new bank account just to use Paypal due to arbitrary freezing of my first account. \u00a0Bitcoin, on the other hand, is decentralized and I am completely certain that nobody has the ability to limit my access to my Bitcoin wallet, or to move funds from my Bitcoin wallet.\nYour $ in Paypal is just information stored and guaranteed by Paypal; likewise, your BTC in Bitcoin is just information stored and guaranteed by the Bitcoin protocol. \u00a0The difference is that Paypal can rewrite your balance at any time, and it usually isn\u2019t $92 Quadrillion in your favor. \u00a0Paypal is a centralized way to move money and the benefits of that are numerous: buyer and seller protection, chargebacks, etc. \u00a0However, the abuse of centralized systems such as Paypal, Visa, and Mastercard has caused the average merchant to tack on ~10% premium on their prices to deal with associated transaction fees, and exponentially increased risks of fraud. \u00a0This is the exact reason why most brick and mortar institutions will offer a cash discount, and also a Bitcoin discount should they chose to accept Bitcoin.\n\u00a0\nFees\nPaypal charges nearly 3% for transactions between people. \u00a0If you were using eBay to sell an item and had to take Paypal as payment, you also lost 9% of your final value to a final value fee. \u00a0Bitcoin transaction fees make every archaic money transfer system from the wire transfer to the Paypal transfer. \u00a0Some countries allow Paypal users to send personal amounts of money to other domestic Paypal users with no fee via a personal transfer tab. \u00a0This option/tab has been removed without notice from many Paypal services in various countries around the world including Japan and Brazil. \u00a0Essentially, Japanese and Brazilians must pay Paypal\u2019s usury-like fees even when sending money as a gift between persons. \u00a0Paypal charges additional fees if currency conversion needs to take place, which usually happens in international transfers.\nLet\u2019s be clear, participating in the Bitcoin economy is not without fees. \u00a0On average, there is still days of waiting time for fiat deposits and withdrawals to the world\u2019s many Bitcoin exchanges. \u00a0In addition to the time lag of moving fiat into Bitcoin, exchanges also charge trading fees usually in the less than 1% range. \u00a0For instance, Coinbase, a direct competitor to Paypal that utilizes Bitcoin instead of an archaic system, charges 1% + $0.15 for every USD\u2013>BTC and BTC\u2013>USD transaction for personal users with even better rates for business users. \u00a0Additionally, Coinbase users can send Bitcoins to and from each other without even paying a transaction fee. \u00a0In this way, Coinbase, a centralized layer on top of Bitcoin, can provide the exact same centralized services that we have come to expect from Paypal, with significantly less fees. \u00a0I can buy items using my Bitcoins via services such as snapCard, and if I were ever to be in Japan, I would be able to send a friend money w\n\u00a0\nGlobal Access\nThere are dozens of countries that Paypal does not support, notable among them are Iran, Afghanistan, North Korea, and Haiti. \u00a0While these countries have many other factors contributing to the lack of a stable financial system compatible with Paypal, their constituents still deserve access to a global payment structure. \u00a0Very simply, internet users in countries not supported by Paypal are largely unable to participate in \u201conline shopping\u201d despite the near global reach of delivery services. \u00a0The world deserves a money that can be accepted from\u00a0anywhere in the world. \u00a0Paypal doesn\u2019t deal with these countries due to political reasons mostly. \u00a0Needless to say, Bitcoin does not discriminate in such ways and all that is required for access \u00a0and inclusion is hardware and a data connection. \u00a0While services like Coinbase do not yet exist in every country in the world, Localbitcoins\u00a0does and is ready to facilitate a Bitcoin economy anywhere in the world.\n\u00a0\nBitcoin is superior to Paypal in every way; however, it won\u2019t be until Bitcoin has the same market capitalization as Paypal that we will truly begin to see Bitcoin\u2019s widespread use in lieu of Paypal around the world. \u00a0In the meantime, it\u2019s always a possibility that Bitcoin will be allowed as a way for Paypal users around the world to fund their still-fiat-denominated accounts. \u00a0In fact, Paypal\u2019s President David Marcus recently admitted to owning Bitcoin\u00a0and assured the community that he was keeping a close eye on developments in the Bitcoin sphere.", "category": "News"}

{"title": "Another Lame Banker Attacks Bitcoin", "url": "https://www.ccn.com/another-lame-bankster-attacks-bitcoin/", "birthday": "2013-12-31T16:57:45+00:00", "date": "2013-12-31 16:57:45", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 31, "content": "Another day, another banker, another ignorant jab at Bitcoin. This time it\u2019s Steven Englander of Citibank, America\u2019s third largest TBTF zombiebank. Mr. Englander wisely steers clear of attacking Bitcoin on the basis of made-up numbers, instead relying on rhetoric. He writes (and I comment) as follows:\nThe libertarian streak in me likes the anonymity of Bitcoin transactions, but there\u00a0 is a rational part of me that asks whether that aspect is essential if I am paying for a latte in Soho.\u00a0 Similarly if the Bitcoin wallet can be made more secure by dropping\u00a0 anonymity, how many transactors will give up transactional security for libertarian principle? Giving up anonymity may make Bitcoin transactions more secure, and I suspect almost all transactors will value security much more than anonymity.\nThis is a false choice. If Mr. Englander\u2019s rational side wants to pay for a latte in Soho without anonymity, it can use a credit card. If it wants anonymity, plus far better security than a credit card, there\u2019s Bitcoin.\nDespite all the intensive research I\u2019m sure Mr. Englander didn\u2019t put into his article, there is no likely scenario in which de-anonymising transactions would offer improved security against bad actors. If Target accepted pseudonymous Bitcoin, 40 million people wouldn\u2019t have had their accounts and data compromised.\n\nGoing further, Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nodes are not needed, if there was less concern about keeping Bitcoin outside the current payments/fiat currency system. The nodes allow transactions to be validated by the Bitcoin community, but you can have efficient transactions without the particular validation system used by Bitcoin.\u00a0\u00a0 The secure ledger of transactions can be centralized rather than decentralized. Bitcoin\u2019s particular approach may be attractive for those who really want to operate outside the current financial system. There may be both legitimate and illegitimate reasons for this, but the vast majority of\u00a0 transactions do not have this need.\nCentralisation, item two on the list of prohibited changes, would of course require a hardfork. And a name change, because it sure wouldn\u2019t be Bitcoin any more. I suggest that Mr. Englander call his latte-purchasing, centralised and identity-linked fork \u201cCitiBits.\u201d \nAnd here\u2019s a legitimate reason for keeping Bitcoin outside the existing payments/fiat currency system: why would Bitcoiners wish to link their savings to rapidly depreciating fiat currencies? Here\u2019s another: what if people\u2019s accounts are seized, as in Cyprus? And one more for the road:\u00a0what if the financial system fails catastrophically, as it nearly did in 2008? \n\nGoing even further, if Bitcoin or an alternative currency embraced the financial regulatory system to make it more secure, how much payments efficiency is lost? You can still have secure, instantaneous transactions but inside the financial system there may be more security against fraud and more recourse if your Bitcoins are contained in your PC which gets hit by a meteor.\nAgain, Mr. Englander just doesn\u2019t get it. Even suspending disbelief long enough to imagine an impeccably honest, centralised CitiBit processing department with, incidentally, enough juice to match the world\u2019s largest computing network, how would this be any more secure? One meteor strike and the entire system fails, never mind a single wallet. \nSo there is this story about a special recipe for potato fritters (a very good recipe that I have tried). When a chef is handed the recipe, she decides to\u00a0 \u2018improve\u2019 it by replacing each ingredient one-by-one with something more familiar. Having done so, she and her husband decide that the final result isn\u2019t nearly as good as advertised and is pretty close to what they prepare all the time.\u00a0 In eliminating anonymity, decentralization and non-regulation, much of the original intent of the Bitcoin developer(s) is being thwarted. The question is whether the core innovation of Bitcoin has been compromised or whether unneeded baggage is being\u00a0 dropped.\nHere Mr. Englander descends into folksy fritter analogies to show that replacing Bitcoin with credit cards called \u201cBitcoin\u201d is best for everyone. Are you convinced yet?\nFor the record, mining Bitcoin is waste of resources from a social perspective. The amount of CPU and electricity needed to mine Bitcoin is high, and from a social viewpoint about as valuable as building defenses against attacks from Mars. What the mining\u00a0 does is decide the allocation of the limited amount of Bitcoin produced each period and encourage the ledger to be kept. There is a\u00a0 real social cost to the decentralization designed into Bitcoin.\nLuckily, printing paper money and minting coins doesn\u2019t waste any resources, right? Apparently, diverting billions if not trillions of taxpayer fiats to bailing out giant banks (which embraced moral hazard to speculate on complex derivatives to predictably disastrous result) isn\u2019t a waste of social resources either. Right? \nAnyway, it would appear that someone\u2019s been reading Krugman\u2026 But mocking The Krug\u2019s ridiculous \u201clet\u2019s fix the economy by printing infinite money to prepare for a fake alien invasion\u201d gaffe while adopting his flawed \u201cmining is wasteful\u201d argument doesn\u2019t really widen Mr. Englander\u2019s apparently razor-thin libertarian streak. Here is the hint: mining is done to process everyone\u2019s transactions. Even were it not for this fact, efficient mining turns electricity into more money than the electricity costs, so I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s wasteful as opposed to productive.\n\nIf Bitcoin is a payments technology, much of what makes it efficient and attractive can be retained, while dropping some features that most users find unnecessary. Bitcoin may become less attractive to illicit users as a result, but that is a sacrifice many will be willing to make. Culturally, the developers of Bitcoin may find this evolution extremely unattractive, because the distrust of the financial system and of financial authorities was one of the motivations for its development. However attractive philosophically, many users will vote for pragmatism over principle and a Bitcoin clone that satisfied this pragmatic streak could be able to overcome the first mover advantage.\nAt least Mr. Englander has done his homework and polled a significant number of Bitcoin users about which features they find attractive and which they\u2019d nonchalantly discard. Oh wait\u2026 No, he hasn\u2019t. He just made up that \u201cmost users\u201d part. And of course, his justification for breaking Bitcoin is stopping naughty people, blah blah\u2026\nBut next he makes an interesting point, at last. I agree with him, let\u2019s get pragmatic! Let\u2019s put theory into practice and let the market decide\u2026 Mr. Englander, please make your centralised, de-anonymised, proprietary CitiBits and release them to trade freely on cryptocurrency exchanges. It will be most interesting to follow their adoption rate and value relative to Bitcoin. And if value doesn\u2019t instantly shoot to the moon as expected, will Citi\u2019s deep-pocketed pumping operations be de-anonymised for security purposes? \nSo far I have ignored Bitcoin as a store of value, but the proponents of Bitcoin as a store of value/speculation crucially need Bitcoin to be unique and have strong barriers to entry, despite the replicability of the technology. If it turns out that investors/miners will arbitrage between Bitcoin and other mined alternative currencies, the outcome will be that there are many perfect or near perfect substitutes for Bitcoin, and the effective supply will be much larger than would be suggested by the gradually increasing and ultimately capped supply of the original Bitcoin.\u00a0 This will mean that valuations will be very fragile because in the long-term there will be no ability to limit the supply of Bitcoin lookalikes \u2026 unless some subset of Bitcoin-like currencies gain government/central bank endorsement which gives them an advantage over non-endorsed Bitcoin-like currencies.\nCertainly, an infinite amount of alts can be produced. However, the network effect rules that genuine innovation (and perhaps gimmicky marketing tricks, thanks Dogecoin) will be required to catch up to Bitcoin\u2019s ever-expanding usage. But really, this is another specious argument cribbed from The Krugmeister. Zimbabwe can compensate for its failing economy by printing all the Zim Dollars it likes, without tanking the value of the German Mark. The only result will be that people won\u2019t want Zim Dollars because they\u2019ll be worthless, and the same is true for cookie-cutter altcoins with no real economy.\n\nFurther, the Fed is now started on tapering and the BoE is talking about tightening, however slowly. Whatever sins major central banks commit, they are forgiven rapidly when they show any sign of moving back to orthodoxy,\u00a0 provided they have not hugely compromised price stability, and sometimes even when they have. Improved confidence in some G4 fiat currencies is giving gold bad days, and the willingness to take the risk on alternative currencies may be inverse to how unrestrained major central banks are in their reserves creation.\u00a0 Investors and central banks are looking for improved stores of value beyond fiat currencies, and Bitcoin possibly may be one of them. There are scenarios in which it could work as a store of value\u00a0 but there are clearly many, many outcomes in which Bitcoin is one of a bunch of alternatives with a very indeterminate value.\nTranslation: the Fed now prints $75,000,000,000 instead of $85,000,000,000 a month to stave off the inevitable implosion of the financial system. Interest rates remain at record lows but the BoE has made some soothing noises. Therefore everything is fine now and we can all go back to full faith and credit in our debauched fiat currency. Nothing to see here, folks, show\u2019s over. Also, gold derivative contracts largely unbacked by physical metal have been consistently hammered with naked shorts, so no one apart from two billion Chinese and one billion Indians want that silly yellow stuff\u2026 Another sound argument against the alternatives to flagging fiat currencies, although potato fritters are notable by their absence.\nBottom line, there is the possibility that Bitcoin represents a big step forward in payments technology, but there are also seem to be straightforward ways to improve on its security, make it less attractive to criminals and more attractive to governments. It is far from guaranteed that that it will emerge as a stable store of value. Either function would be enhanced if it were within the financial system and embraced by the authorities, but it is unclear whether the Bitcoin philosophy will change fast enough or whether an alternative alternative will pip Bitcoin\u2019s original first mover advantage.\nThis bottom line is about as lacking as Citibank\u2019s would be if forced to re-adopt standard accounting practices and mark its toxic assets to market. Bitcoin\u2019s philosophy won\u2019t change to accomodate the wishes of petty plutocrats, so I wish Mr. Englander the best of luck in pipping us with his CitiBits.\n\u2013\nWell, that\u2019s it. Pretty lame kung fu, really. The joke is a banker who pretends to libertarian sympathies while advocating centralisation and government control.", "category": "News"}

Predictably, given her allegiances, she finds it to be an unsuitable alternative to AUD.\nHer (foregone) conclusion is ostensibly based on a laughably inaccurate data-point:\n\u201c1723 registered businesses worldwide advertised as using Bitcoin (no doubt there are more in reality), [which] suggests there may be something in the idea that there is [sic] currently more people buying Bitcoin in anticipation of an increase in Bitcoin value, rather than buying Bitcoin in order to use them as a payment method. That strongly suggests a bubble in the present value of Bitcoin.\u201d\nIn reality, an alternate and parenthetical dimension to the banking elite, there are at least an order of magnitude more businesses accepting Bitcoin \u2013 and that\u2019s only counting businesses using BitPay for payment processing!\nIncluding Coinbase\u2019s reported 16,000 merchants, plus smaller payment networks like Coin Payments, not to mention all the folks accepting direct payments, 1723 is an absolutely ludicrous figure. My initial suspicion was that this number was pulled from CoinMap, which currently reports 2152 primarily brick and mortar Bitcoin merchants. Emma Lawson later states the figure was culled from \u201cthe Bitcoin website.\u201d No further mention is made as to which Bitcoin website is the Bitcoin website.\nNext in NAB\u2019s analysis, we have this gem:\nExhibit 2: Banker Brain to Air Ratio \u2013 frothy?\nThe above chart is meant to further illustrate that Bitcoin is nothing but digital tulip mania. Clearly the inclusion of volume is meant to underscore that price is shooting to the moon on vapour. Again, this is laughably bad research, especially considering the report\u2019s previous pie-chart shows Bitcoin China holding 47% of exchange volume. Indeed, anyone with even a passing interest in Bitcoin knows there was a tremendous surge of volume in China accompanying the last rise.\nThe Estimated USD Transaction Volume on Blockchain.info illustrates this pretty clearly:\nEstimated USD Transaction Volume\nThere are other howlers in NAB\u2019s analysis. The usual Keynesian deflationary bugbear is trotted out, whereby personal savings rising in value is deemed the ultimate economic catastrophe. What could possibly be worse than falling prices? Why, the ever-widening gap between elites and everyone else might actually narrow if that were to happen!\nPresumably the value of savings approaching zero, as bankers debauch the people\u2019s money through endless printing, is the preferred scenario. Certainly the inflationary results of money-printing spur the infernal consumption engine, as consumers dash to convert their depreciating cash to material trash. But is this economic model even remotely workable in a world of rising populations and diminishing resources?\nBitcoin also comes under fire as a currency for being dependant on social trust.\n\u201cThere must be trust in the system, for Bitcoin to retain any value. This is how it differs from other payment methods like credit cards and PayPal, which have a pool of funds backing them.\u201d\nOf course, that the fiat money \u201cpool of funds\u201d depends solely on trust in the omniscience of central planners passes without mention.\nAnother \u2018highlight\u2019 in the report is the following:\n\u201cIn a discussion about Bitcoin with a computer engineer I asked \u201chow is it created?\u201d and had the spiel about computing power, energy and the resources needed to identify prime numbers. Ok, that\u2019s great, I may never understand the maths but I get that it requires substantial resources to compute. The next question \u201cso what does it produce that is valuable?\u201d answer \u2013 nothing.\u201d\nIt seems to me that a Senior Currency Strategist who can\u2019t be bothered to grasp the underlying maths in the course of investigating the workings of a new competitor currency needs a more suitable job title.\nIf this is the best anti-Bitcoin argument that can be mustered by the 17th largest bank in the world then, contrary to the bank\u2019s conclusion, it bodes extremely well for Bitcoin replacing fiat in the near future.\n\u2013\nNAB\u2019s full report can be viewed at this link on Zero Hedge. Amusingly, the first comment links to MayorLar\u2019s first article on this site, in which he really came out swinging at the bankers.

Bitcoin-related articles which run there frequently divide commentators into those who distrust Bitcoin\u2019s virtual, even \u201cimaginary\u201d nature, and those who admire its relative independence from central bank / state control. A single non-polarising exception was found in the response to Paul Krugman\u2019s latest set of arguments against Bitcoin, in which it was widely agreed that nothing could possibly be worse than Paul Krugman.\nUnlike many who seemed motivated more by ideology than the facts, Mr. Mix decided to conduct his own research before choosing his side of the \u201cdiscussion.\u201d In fact, it could be better called an argument, as the ZH comment section is known as Fight Club for good reason.\n As a businessman who conducts international trade in machine parts, Mr. Mix approached Bitcoin in a serious-minded way. First seeking the advice of experts, he then tackled the initial hurdle of acquiring Bitcoin before testing out the Bitcoin market for precious metals. He covers all these aspect in detail in a series of articles, republished from his personal blog with his kind permission. In later installments, Mr. Mix delves into some of the mathematic and cryptographic aspects of Bitcoin. \nApart from being a good tutorial and an interesting read for their own sake, I believe that Bitcoin merchants, service providers \u2013 really anyone seeking to expand the economy \u2013 will benefit from this series of articles by Mr. Mix. They provide a great example of the questions, concerns and tests with which new entrants approach the Bitcoin economy.\n\u2013\nFun With Bitcoin For Beginners by Robert Mix \n(first published on Tuesday the 12th of November, 2013)\n\n\u00a0\nLet me start with this:\n1P11zA1GaJcyjc7oVt1jVQvWcPoW12sv5R\n (You do not have to send me any money, but feel free if you would like. I would encourage anyone so inclined to send me a really small but unusual amount, say 0.00173 Bitcoin for example and email me the information if you would like, particularly if you would like to mentioned (or not) here at my blog)\n That is a genuine Bitcoin wallet, in which you can send me a rough equivalent of money. \u00a0At least if you know how. \u00a0And in this article I hope to tell all of you just enough to get started on the Bitcoin Trail.\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n It\u2019s a complicated topic, but Bitcoins (\u201cBTC\u201d for short) are a type of digital encrypted currency, this is one part of what deep-thinkers call \u201cmoney\u201d, BTC does serve as a \u201cMedium of Exchange\u201d (one of the three roles of money). Germany in August 2013 (in the wikipedia article referenced below) declared BTC to also be a \u201cUnit of Account\u201d (the second attribute of \u201cmoney\u201d). \u00a0No one has yet said that BTC would be the their role of \u201cmoney (\u201cStore of Value\u201d, gold is probably the best Store of Value there is). \u00a0BTC\u2019s price is extremely volatile, in the past year or two the price per Bitcoin has varied from around $5.00 each to about $365 (now). \u00a0So, buying or holding should be viewed as speculative, unless you are doing immediate transactions (buying or selling stuff, donating, etc.) or experimenting with the system (like I am).\nBitcoin is \u201csafe\u201d in one important sense: it is essentially impossible to decrypt (and so, steal) them. \u00a0But, BTC are NOT completely anonymous, in the screenshot further below, BTC creation is tracked by country, this is \u201csort of\u201d public knowledge.\nWhat is Bitcoin Worth?\n Here\u2019s a place where you can see how much a Bitcoin is worth, along with some other monetary instruments:\nhttp://ounce.me\nI donated 0.01 BTC to this site, although I was unable to put in a screenshot below. \u00a0In case YOU want to donate (as I did, hah!), here is their BTC wallet:\n 1ozMe81f5oUjCbtJUrFNfSHUfrmBGdedo\n You should go check the site yourselves, I could not get a useful screenshot, but the site shows several handy (for many of my readers anyway) quotations ($-value of BTC, as well as the four US-traded precious metals (Au, Ag, Pt, Pd), crude oil (W Texas Intermediate) and the US 10-Year Bond Yield. \u00a0It also shows the price of gold and silver in BTC.\nToo bad I could not get the screenshot in, it is close to elegant, take a look!\n Who Invented It?\n\n Bitcoin was invented in 2008 (at least the concept) by \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d (they say) and involves a very complicated and hard-to-crack encryption system, reference:\u00a0http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin. \u00a0Wikipedia also had this nice little item re Paul Krugman, who does not like BTC:\n Economist\u00a0Paul Krugman\u00a0has been critical of Bitcoin, suggesting that the structure of the currency incentivizes hoarding[88]\u00a0and also stating its value from the expectation that others will accept it as payment.[89]\u00a0Krugman considers it wasteful to spend real resources, such as electric power, on the creation of Bitcoins.[90]\nI am not a fan of Paul Krugman, in fact I usually \u201ctake the other side of the bet\u201d (assume he is lying), so his distaste for BTC might actually be a positive\u2026 \u00a0Mr. Krugman! \u00a0Doesn\u2019t printing money use up real resources as well?\nGetting Started with Test Transactions\nI was given 0.11 BTC\u00a0(worth, roughly, $35!) by a guy whom I will call the \u201cOriginal Donor\u201d or O.D. for short. \u00a0He gave them to me, sent to my Bitcoin wallet at the top of this article. \u00a0He told me to go forth and \u201cdo things\u201d (my words) and then write it up. \u00a0This has encouraged me to look into a number of interesting little niches, that technophiles will likely enjoy. \u00a0Because BTCs are divisible to eight digits (meaning you can give tiny quantities), 0.11 is more than it sounds.\nO.D. also helped me to set up my BTC wallet (account) set up, I went looking for people who would accept a free gift of BTC! \u00a0I expected Zero Hedge would be a good hunting ground for Bitcoin recipients, went into the Zero Hedge \u201cChat Room\u201d and inquired if anyone wanted free BTC. \u00a0Within about 15 seconds \u201cqqqqtrader\u201d put his wallet number out, so he (she?) was the first recipient, I sent 0.01 BTC (worth about $3.50). \u00a0I wound up giving similar amounts to two others as well as the the lucky \u201cAtm0sphere\u201d who got 0.019, I will get to that in a little while.\n1MZoWrZRqmX4Uu1XN6Hsgqk7pA44NnUksM \u00a0 \u2014 qqqqtrader\n13hxDqmZCdWixu2ydAciyVH5CbBtyjQ3Ym \u00a0 \u2014 WAMBACHUMBA\n1FcuSYzb7EZREsBvAmQ298z6DDpxfwQZam \u00a0 \u2014 OldE_Ant\n19GZ1VKUbK6TQYwzqd92ewRuE42rNRF6xo \u00a0 \u2014 Atm0sphere\n(I also sent 0.01 BTC to my O.D. to continue my testing)\n\u2013\nAll of the above (except Atm0sphere) received the same 0.01 amount. \u00a0The first three received theirs within about 30 seconds or so. \u00a0The next evening, Atm0sphere wanted a donation, so I sent him 0.01 as well. \u00a0But, this one did not go through in seconds like the others did\u2026 \u00a0I waited a few minutes, looked at my Multibit Client and tried to see what was going on. \u00a0The transaction was not being confirmed. \u00a0Ahh. \u00a0So, I told (ZH Chat) that I would try again, but with just 0.005 BTC, as my account was (and is) being drained\u2026 \u00a0Still, the two transactions were hung-up somewhere there in Cyberspace, so after a few more minutes, I tried again, but with 0.004 BTC. \u00a0Total: 0.019. \u00a0Just then he told me that the BTC had finally landed into his wallet, I then went to my Multibit account, and saw, yes indeed the BTC were transferred OK.Lesson learned: \u00a0If you send out BTC, wait half an hour so before sending any more!\nWhat Countries Are Using Bitcoin?\nSince then, I have sent BTC (0.01 in each case) to the O.D., as well as to two interesting websites (ounce.me) and this interesting site mentioned recently by Zero Hedge. \u00a0Here is a most interesting screenshot that Andrew Hodel sent me of his http://fiatleak.com website (click on the image for a better view, I would strongly encourage everyone to go have a look at fiatleak.com, as when you seem the streaming content, some of what you see below becomes clearer\u2026)::\n\nThere is a lot going on the above (again, please go to the site yourself!). \u00a0First, note that service shows near-real-time of BTC transactions around the world. \u00a0That big green number (+4888.1 BTC = approx. $1,784,000) refers to the amount of BTC sent from when you started looking at it that session (that is, it refreshes the screen from \u201czero\u201d each time you go). \u00a0I would guesstimate that it took perhaps 60 \u2013 90 minutes from when Andrew opened his session until he took that screen shot.\nThe red letters refer to currency, each is the local one used there. \u00a0USD\u00a0is in US dollars, CNY\u00a0is Chinese Yuan. \u00a0The little red number under USD (561649.48) means that $561,649.48 was converted from dollars into BTC. \u00a0In some 60 \u2013 90 minutes\u2026 \u00a0The little green number under the 561649.48 refers to the number of BTC being generated (here: 1641.93 BTC). \u00a0China has even more impressive numbers (again, here): 4,635,429.7 Chinese Yuan (approx. $760,000) with a 2936.02 BTC. \u00a0China and the USA are by far the biggest users of BTC, here approximately 93.5% of the world total!\nI will mention three other features of the fiatleak screenshot above. \u00a0First, the little orange circles with a \u201cB\u201d in them are Bitcoins being created from local cash (left arc represents the past several seconds of US BTC creation), the two to the right are Chinese, and the one \u201cover Italy\u201d is in the Eurozone. Second, the little gold dots running along just above the currency symbols are BTCs being made. \u00a0The higher the little dot, the greater the amount. \u00a0If the amount is enough, the vertical green numbers appear, you can see a pair of BTC creations of about 48.5 BTCs ($17,700 each) each towards the left (\u201cunder Baja California\u201d and \u201cleft of Peru\u201d).\nI would strongly urge any of you who \u201cdo\u201d BTCs to donate to Mr. Hodel, here is his BTC wallet:\n1DUtwZkDZTy4ZDNzE7mDZ4r9QRZc2D8kCC\nI sent him 0.01 BTC!\nDo Most People Know About Bitcoin Yet?\nResults of my own (non-scientific) investigations among acquaintances regarding use of BTC were disappointing.\na) \u00a0I asked ALL of my Facebook friends (74) if any of them wanted any free (0.01) BTC. \u00a0Results? \u00a00 /74\n\n b) \u00a0I asked ALL members of my Joke List (about 52 members) if they wanted the same. \u00a0Results: 0 / 52\n\n c) \u00a0I asked three members (a friend, an AT&T cellphone store and a Starbucks cashier) if they had even HEARD of BTC. \u00a0Results: 0 / 3\n\n d) \u00a0I asked ALL members at pmbug.com (a gold-oriented forum-style website, 565 members signed up (so let\u2019s call it 250 active members), everyone should check it out as well). \u00a0Results: 0 wanted any BTC\nSo, among those I know (there is a fair amount of duplication in the above), Total:\n74 + 52 + 250 = 376 people had their chance to get free money, NONE wanted it.\n3 people I talked \u00a0with: 0 of them had even heard of BTC\u2026\nHow to Install and Use a Wallet\nBitcoin is very technical\u2026\nFirst I had to find a Bitcoin client-side program, my O.D. suggested Multibit 0.5.14, so I went to download it. \u00a0The download went fine until my computer then told me I needed to download Java (owned by Oracle now, it is some kind of computer language that can be run on many types of devices). \u00a0OK, OK, I downloaded Java as well.\nAfter all of that, Mutlibit provides a desktop icon that allows you to start using BTC immediately (assuming you have any to spend or you can get someone to send you some). \u00a0After I was ready. the O.D. sent me the 0.11 BTC and told me to go forth and use them\u2026\nAnd so I have. \u00a0I have 0.02 BTC in my wallet. \u00a0That may not sound like much (it is worth some $8 if I read correctly this morning), but, I can chop my donations to 0.002 or even much less\u2026\nHere is an example of Multibit Raw Transaction Details (from me to \u201cqqqqtrader\u201d):\nab49600e12a0d32f8377d0298d1d9363c0a66049823d7599017831671a419d63:\nSeen by 4 peers.

It shows a log scale of the Bitcoin price in USD on Gox, plus an unusual indicator. This indicator seems to plot a shallow sine wave, a moving average, an oscillator and\u2026 some frequencies? I really have no idea what that thing is, perhaps a Hilbert Sine Wave indicator with some mods, but it\u2019s certainly interesting\u2026 Especially as it did a great job of calling the recent double top! The thread title said to sell in ~115 days, just 11 days past the collapse of the double top formation.\nThe thread\u2019s author, bb113, describes his work as follows:\nThe top chart is price up to the date of the post in log scale. It is only mt gox. The second is the mystery indicator which looks like it cycles with different periods, the strongest of which is 230.4 days. That is where the 115 day prediction came from. When mystery indicator is high it has been a good time to buy (in the past), when it was low it was good time to sell. The red and green lines are dates when the mystery indicator had \u201cpeaks\u201d, the value from the peaks is also shown below as the boxplots and density plot.\nThis talk of cycles got me interested. Instead of trying to figure out the indicator, I went and plotted the duration of Bitcoin price peak to price peak. Sure enough, these work out (from April 2013) to about 230 days. These periods are shown in green on the below chart. Next, I plotted sideways or downwards periods in red, and strong upwards pushes in blue. Intriguingly, these periods also turn out to be fairly regular. Apart from the very first instance, the red intervals cover sideways / downwards movements over about 150 days. Finally I plotted the upward surges in blue, noting these have the highest percentage range, spanning between 60 and 88 days.\nBitcoin price peaks in green, surges in blue and sideways / down in red. Orange is overlapping green & red, light blue is overlapping green & blue.\nThis seems to portray a definite cyclical element to the Bitcoin price. Although imprecise, if the pattern holds it may give indications to major turning points in the Bitcoin price for the year of 2014. In an update to his thread on the 23rd of December 2013, bb113 posted an updated Bitcoin price chart along with the comment:\nHere is an updated chart. It looks like the indicator did have a lower peak a few weeks ago. So that means it recommends to hodl steady (buy stuff with btc then replenish) for another ~100 days then start buying and sell in ~220 days. I have no idea why this cycle would exist and I would expect it to end now that this thread has gotten attention.\nIn other words, he says the next ramp will occur around the start of April 2014 and put in its top around the start of August.\nNow, I don\u2019t know about lower peaks on his mysterious indicator, but projecting the cyclical pattern forwards in time, I get this chart:\nBitcoin price peaks in green, surges in blue and sideways / down in red. Handy annotations predict the future!\nGoing by this, the magic blocks say to buy early in April and sell out\u00a0 mid-July \u2013 pretty close to bb113\u2019s results.\nAlthough it seems bb113 is no longer giving out 0.1 BTC rewards to those who can guess his indicator, I think I\u2019ve gotten close to at least the cycles he mentions.\nUsing a log chart makes the Bitcoin price peaks clear across the rise in Bitcoin\u2019s value from cents to over a thousand Bernanke-bux.\u00a0 That bull runs have begun 150 days into each peak to peak cycle is also very interesting and suggestive of\u2026 I have no idea what!\nIf you\u2019d like to check out interactive versions of my cyclical and other charts, they can be found on my TradingView profile. Pressing the \u201cplay\u201d button will add any new daily bars.\nRight now, the above patterns are my best guess at what 2014 holds for the Bitcoin price. Unfortunately I can\u2019t (yet) give you an in-depth explanation for the patterns I\u2019ve noticed (thanks to bb113 and with help from a Russian charist on TradingView) and of course I can\u2019t guarantee the Bitcoin price will perform accordingly. Still, I hope you find them helpful or at least interesting. Please feel free to investigate this \u201cphenomenon\u201d further and get back to me, either here or on Trading View, with any further ideas or observations.\nBest of luck with all your trades in 2014!\n\u2013\nThis is a part of the Cryptocurrency Investment Club by CryptoCoinsNews.com.\nJoin our FREE and EXCLUSIVE Cryptocurrency Investment Club!

New money is flowing into the different Bitcoin-exchanges and people want more action. This time it is a bit special since it\u2019s the little Christmas eve. I believe that Bitcoin might rise with more than 10% on Monday. And here is why I believe so:\nThere will be very little negative news about Bitcoin during the Christmas holidays. Governments (that can make most of the bad news) are off to their own holidays. People are in a happy mood where they want to see positive news. This will keep Bitcoin-fans and Bitcoin-businesses to push good stories on e.g. Reddit and Bitcointalk. There might even be some good news coming up during Christmas regarding Christmas related Bitcoin-stories.\nWill Bitcoin rise to 700 USD?\nAs you can see from the graph above, the lowest price-level of Bitcoin looks like to be around 580 USD per Bitcoin. The Bitcoin trend seems to have turned upwards after hitting the low of 560 USD per Bitcoin late December 21st. Then it charged back up to around 660 to 680 USD per Bitcoin in mid December 22nd. Now we are back down to 614 USD which may be the lowest we will go this coming week.\nMy personal guess is that the Bitcoin-price will be 680 USD per Bitcoin or even more on Monday 23rd. We could be looking at a price above 700 USD as well. Now, let\u2019s wait and see what will happen on the little Christmas eve.

Gox Bitcoin price in USD, we\u2019ve also got relative volume bars semi-visible in the background. Also shown are Fibonacci levels, a trendline and the MACD indicator. In the first section, I\u2019ll cover these details and why I consider them important. In the next section, I\u2019ll formulate a trading plan.\n1) The Chart of the Past\n\nThe colour-coded areas correspond to the Fibonacci retracement levels. The levels are traced from the \u201cSilk Road seizure\u201d low of $109.50 in early October, up to the $1250 highs in late November and early December. A quick refresher on Fib levels:\nthe red zone at the top represents a Bitcoin price range between the high and 23.6% lower,\nthe next level down in yellow is the continuation of the range down to a 38.2% drop (or \u201cretracement,\u201d in trading terms) from the uptrend highs,\nthe green covers a continuation down to 50% (not a true Fibonacci sequence value, but frequently included for its utility),\nthe weird greenish-blue colour covers a continuation down to 61.8%,\nthe blue covers a continuation down to 76.4%. and finally,\nthe grey area shows the Bitcoin price range back down to the 100% which would represent a full retracement.\nUnless the Bitcoin price falls into the deadly mists of the grey zone, it remains valid to consider price as being in a long-term uptrend. Within this long-term uptrend, we\u2019re currently experiencing a medium-term downtrend / retracement, as represented on the chart by the yellow line. I would consider a break to the upside of this trendline on strong volume to be a partial buy signal.\nNext we come to the MACD (Moving Average Convergence / Divergence) indicator shown in the lower block. As the name suggests, this indicator plots two moving averages against each other. The values used in my chart \u2013 and the default values on BitcoinWisdom, where the indicator is also available \u2013 are for a 9 day exponential moving average (9D EMA) signal line and a 26D EMA minus a 12D EMA line. The pink histogram displays the difference between these indicators \u2013 shortening bars indicate convergence and lengthening bars divergence.\n\nI include the MACD as it gave a very clear signal on 2013-12-05, as indicated by my \u201csell\u201d arrow annotation and the grey, dashed vertical line connecting it to price. The signal was given when the fast signal line crossed the slow MACD line to the downside and the histogram flipped into negative territory.\u00a0\nA discrepancy between the Bitcoin price peaks and the peaks in the fast line is also visible. Price peaks at the same level, whereas the MACD shows a slip in the fast line peaks. \nCoupled with a lower high on what was then the leading market, BTC China, the MACD indicator signal and the inability of the Bitcoin price to breach $1250, we had a clear confluence of signals shouting \u201cSELL!\u201d\u00a0\n2) The Plan for the Future\nAs I\u2019m now in the market waiting for a good entry-point to buy back in, I am looking at all the above signals for an equally strong \u201cBUY!\u201d signal from the market. Let\u2019s consider what the chart is showing us:\n\n1) The Bitcoin price, always the most direct and important indicator, displays lack of conviction above the 50% Fib level. Sellers seem happy to supply volume above this level for now. This 50% level is also significant as the \u201cdead cat landing area\u201d where price bounced on its first leg down.\n2) Even if the downtrend line is broken to the upside on convincing volume, we\u2019d still need to see a future low-point above the previous low / 61.8% Fib / major breakout confluence around $550 before we can officially declare the downtrend dead.\n3) The MACD is displaying a \u201cpre-signal.\u201d Compare the depth of the histogram around the last low at $550 and the previous low and note that the rate of divergence is contracting. This tells us what we can see from price anyway; that the sudden violent drops which occured from the 5th to the 8th of December have now decelerated into a slower-paced downwards drift. This suggests that downwards pressure is easing, just as upwards pressure clearly eased before the MACD \u201csell\u201d signal. \nI suggest studying the MACD\u2019s historical performance on a daily timeframe to evaluate whether it\u2019s a tool worth including in your own analyis. In my view, it\u2019s given enough useful signals to be worthy of consultation. You\u2019ll notice however that its sell signal came late when the previous Bitcoin price \u201cbubble\u201d burst around April. The collapse happened too quickly for the MACD to sound an actionable warning signal. The MACD is a somewhat lagging indicator which nonetheless offers helpful clues as to when trends are ending and beginning.\nThe above points suggest to me that the time to buy in is\u2026 not quite yet. If we see a re-test of the previous low / $550 / 61.8% level, with price then bouncing quickly on strong volume, ideally without first sending a long tail down into the blue zone, that\u2019d be a decent price signal that the downtrend has abated. \nBefore pulling the trigger on a buy, my plan is requires me to wait for clear signals from price, volume and indicators. If the next low prints higher or equal to the $550 low, I\u2019d take that to mean the Bitcoin price has found support, and that the risk / reward ratio is now slanted to the upside.\n\nThis brings me to my management strategy for trades. Let\u2019s imagine a hypothetical case: price prints another low around $550 then starts moving back up to challenge that yellow trendline. At that point, hoping to get in early on a possible uptrend at a nice cheap price, I\u2019d probably buy in with about 1/3 of my trading capital; the amount of money I can lose without getting so pissed off that I punch doors and crave intoxicants. If price then smashes through that yellow line on rising volume or the MACD shows the fast line passing through the slow, I\u2019d then add in another 1/3. Finally, if the Bitcoin price passes the 23.6% Fib and the previous high point just under $1050, I\u2019d add the final third. \nPosition-weighting like this is good trading practice. Rather than blowing your wad on what you hope is the best price-point, it makes more sense to add to your position only if it proves itself to be a winner.\nHaving established a buying plan, the next consideration is deciding my (mental) stop-loss. In the hypothetical, Bitcoin price has bounced at a point higher or equal to the last low and I\u2019ve taken an opening position. A close below these lows and ruh-roh, the threat of further downside becomes apparent. To control this risk, I decide now on a level to place my \u201cpoint of maximum pain.\u201d Below $400 seems a likely area, if price breaches this level there\u2019ll really be \u201cblood on the bits\u201d and a spate of panic-selling.\n\nBitcoin price Bub and Bob below my bail-out line.\nAlthough it\u2019d suck to sell there and lose money, at least I can only suffer the loss on a fraction of my trading capital. If I had all my capital invested, selling and taking the loss might be painful enough to lead me into \u201cI\u2019ll just hold out until price comes back, however long it takes\u201d territory. That is dangerous ground as it slopes towards the threat of total wipeout. Triggering your stops is never pleasant and a test of your discipline as a trader. Always honour the wisdom of stops though. Despite what your instincts will tell you, it\u2019s a lot better to accept small pain today than risk great pain later.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s talk targets. Say the Bitcoin price behaves such that I can get in somewhere in the blue, aqua or green zones. Then once price nears the all-time high around $1250, I\u2019ll sell 1/3 of my position. This level is likely to present resistance, so it\u2019s a great place to take profit. Beyond that level, I\u2019d probably do a Fibonacci projection to determine my next points to take profit, or just watch price for signs of it banging up against serious resistance, like with the MACD sell signal discussed earlier.\n\nThis is pretty much my trading plan going forward.I should emphasise that it\u2019s a trading plan, designed to make profit without risking too much capital, and not any kind of long-term investment strategy. Such a strategy would be based less on technical analysis than fundamental considerations of such as regulatory risk, decay rate of the legacy financial system, global Bitcoin network growth and merchant adoption, etc. In any case, I generally prefer to build my cryptocurrency investment portfolio from my crypto earnings (\u201cand tips,\u201d he said hopefully) rather than fiat conversions.\n\nI\u2019ll be giving updates on this trading plan whenever I make buy or sell decisions. If you haven\u2019t yet done so, I hope you\u2019ll consider how stop-loss disclipine, setting targets and weighting your position according to price action can help you improve your own trading. I also hope stating my plan will help me stick to it! I\u2019m looking forward to trading Bitcoin actively again.\n Although price has fallen off dramatically and a lot of people are miffed, I believe the recent moves show the health of the cryptocurrency markets. After all, the Bitcoin price rose on good news and fell on bad news \u2013 just like one would expect logically. Contrast the behaviour of stock markets, which have risen to all time highs on central bank money printing despite a slew of negative or only vaguely encouraging data from the real economy. As mental bonkers central bankers can only run their printing presses for so long before destroying their currencies, there\u2019s no doubt which is the healthy, sustainable and rational market!\n\nDisclaimer: if you decide to follow my trading plan and it all goes to hell for whatever reason, it\u2019s not my fault. Anything can happen in the markets, so always do your own research, use stops and only risk money you can afford to lose.\n\u2013\nThis is a part of the Cryptocurrency Investment Club by CryptoCoinsNews.com.\nJoin our FREE and EXCLUSIVE Cryptocurrency Investment Club!

Coinmart.co is here.\nCoinmart is a cryptocurrency marketplace where users can buy or sell services and virutal/physical items. Coinmart offers a platform for both merchants and everyday users to buy and sell items or purchase services. From a merchant selling 100\u2032s of ASIC Miners to a Web Developer offering services and even for a guy selling his 2 year old GPU, Coinmart has got you covered.\nCoinmart will connect you to buyers from all across the globe wanting to buy your product. \u00a0Think of it like the Amazon for Cryptocurrencies. \u00a0As a merchant it will help scale your business without the hassle of maintaining your own website. \u00a0As a service provider it will help connect you with countless potential buyers. \u00a0As a normal guy it will help you sell; well, just about anything.\nJust check out their introductory video:\n\nCoinmart differs from Bitmit in two crucial ways: altcoin support, and services support as well. \u00a0Coinmart will support Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Digitalcoin at launch and plans to integrate Peercoin as well. \u00a0Bitmit, and eBay for that matter, only allows users/merchants to buy/sell products, not services. \u00a0Up until this point, people bidding for services had to go to entirely different websites such as Microlancer. \u00a0Now, Coinmart has taken Microlancer, eBay, and Amazon and rolled it all into one. \u00a0Coinmart is currently in Beta testing, so their selection is not as large as it will be once they officially launch in February 2014. \u00a0Coinmart plans to charge 1.5% on all transactions that go through Coinmart, they also do not plan to charge any normal listing fees or display any ads on their site. \u00a0Compared with eBay\u2019s 9% final value fee, Coinmart saves you so much more money: I imagine many Bitcoiners will be selling their items directly for Bitcoins directly in the near future. \u00a0Of course, escrow services are provided for buyer and seller safety.\nIf you feel like Coinmart\u2019s business model and want to get more involved: Coinmart is currently auctioning off 10% of their shares on the digitalcoin forum. \u00a0Coinmart\u2019s founder is ShimalH who has been involved with the Cryptocoin community for awhile now. \u00a0He is responsible for the recent Digitalcoin Website Redesign; additionally, Coinmart\u2019s development team has done a lot of freelance work including Cryptsy and CoinsforTech.\nHere at CryptoCoinsNews we are eager to cover Bitcoin startups, stay tuned for more articles.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

For an explanation of the Fib levels and MACD indicator, please see the 1st section of my previous post.\nI\u2019ve switched to using the Bitstamp price instead of the Gox price. The exchange I intend to trade on uses the Bitstamp price for reference. This link should take you to the exact chart I\u2019m using over on Trading View \u2013 I recommend this site. They give you live Bitcoin prices (plus charts for a whole lot of other exchanges and currency pairs) and more technical analysis tools than you\u2019ll ever need.\nAt the moment, the Bitcoin price is bumbling along sideways on low volume. I suspect it\u2019s going to pass through that downtrend line without much fanfare.\nAlthough I\u2019m currently bullish, I\u2019m still waiting for a signal (or ideally, a confluence of signals) to enter the market with my trading capital. As per my trading plan in the 2nd section of last weekend\u2019s post, the signals I\u2019m looking out for are:\n1) a break through the downwards trendline on high volatility and volume,\n2) a MACD buy signal. This seems to be forming as the histogram approaches the zero line and the signal line flattens,\n3) price turning down then bouncing from a higher low, or\n4) major Bitcoin-positive news.\nSpeaking of news, so far the announcement that Overstock will accept Bitcoin next year and the establishment of Indian and Indonesian exchanges has done nothing to move Bitcoin price. On the other hand, the transference of ~120k Bitcoin from a long-dormant wallet has spooked a few people but had no discernible effect on price.\nThis combined lack of reaction, plus low volume, suggests the market is sleepy at present. While many of us involved in cryptocurrency expect a continued rise in the Bitcoin price during 2014, my plan remains to wait for the chart to confirm the end of the downtrend and present some solid buy signal(s).\nDisclaimer: if you decide to follow my trading plan and it all goes to hell for whatever reason, it\u2019s not my fault.

The announcement can be viewed on their official website. The full text is as follows:\nThe Reserve Bank of India has today cautioned the users, holders and traders of Virtual currencies (VCs), including Bitcoins, about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks that they are exposing themselves to.\nThe Reserve Bank has mentioned that it has been looking at the developments relating to certain electronic records claimed to be \u201cDecentralised Digital Currency\u201d or \u201cVirtual Currency\u201d (VCs), such as, Bitcoins, litecoins, bbqcoins, dogecoins etc., their usage or trading in the country and the various media reports in this regard.\nThe creation, trading or usage of VCs including Bitcoins, as a medium for payment are not authorised by any central bank or monetary authority. No regulatory approvals, registration or authorisation is stated to have been obtained by the entities concerned for carrying on such activities. As such, they may pose several risks to their users, including the following:\n\nVCs being in digital form are stored in digital/electronic media that are called electronic wallets. Therefore, they are prone to losses arising out of hacking, loss of password, compromise of access credentials, malware attack etc. Since they are not created by or traded through any authorised central registry or agency, the loss of the e-wallet could result in the permanent loss of the VCs held in them.\nPayments by VCs, such as Bitcoins, take place on a peer-to-peer basis without an authorised central agency which regulates such payments. As such, there is no established framework for recourse to customer problems / disputes / charge backs etc.\nThere is no underlying or backing of any asset for VCs. As such, their value seems to be a matter of speculation. Huge volatility in the value of VCs has been noticed in the recent past. Thus, the users are exposed to potential losses on account of such volatility in value.\nIt is reported that VCs, such as Bitcoins, are being traded on exchange platforms set up in various jurisdictions whose legal status is also unclear. Hence, the traders of VCs on such platforms are exposed to legal as well as financial risks.\nThere have been several media reports of the usage of VCs, including Bitcoins, for illicit and illegal activities in several jurisdictions. The absence of information of counterparties in such peer-to-peer anonymous/ pseudonymous systems could subject the users to unintentional breaches of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) laws.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has also stated that it is presently examining the issues associated with the usage, holding and trading of VCs under the extant legal and regulatory framework of the country, including Foreign Exchange and Payment Systems laws and regulations.\nAjit Prasad\nAssistant General Manager\nPress Release : 2013-2014/1261\n\u2013\nUS Dollars will buy a lot more Rupees since April 2013.", "category": "Altcoin News"}

I only mine or buy technically innovative and functionally differentiated cryptocurrency.\nDogecoin, the alt based on a meme, is the bratty toddler of the crypto world. It runs around the room tugging on ladies skirts and biting men\u2019s ankles, endlessly repeating its childish nonsense. Initially charming, Dogecoiners fast become irritating to the point that DOGE price crashes are met with a certain schadenfreude. Yet despite its hyped-up, saccharine shenanigans, Doge has lessons to teach the greater cryptocurrency community.\nDogecoin proves the importance of virality. Although it offers zero technical benefit over other cryptocurrencies, its appeal is all in its sticky memetics which evoke friendly and upbeat emotions. The creator wanted an altcoin without Bitcoin\u2019s gangster connotations and the marketer nailed that with the \u201cdoge\u201d brand. A cute dog babbling like an enthusiastic toddler \u2013 as conceptually distant as possible from Bitcoin\u2019s serious and mature themes: cryptography, programming, anonymity, economics and black markets.\nDogecoin\u2019s \u201cidentity\u201d is both its greatest strength and Achilles heel. Although I suspect a disingenuous hand behind its \u201cjust for fun\u201d design, this message brings a lot of casuals into the world of cryptocurrency. But hard-core coders and merchants are disinclined to touch it; the code is rehashed Litecoin and the long term value of a meme is dubious. According to one of the Bitcoin developers, Dogecode also has potential pitfalls for miners.\nFor now, popular appeal and a reputed million dollar backing prevail to keep Dogecoin in the first division of the cryptocurrency market cap rankings. Demographically, cryptocurrency is predominantly tech-pro adult males. Doge forsakes technical depth to speak to a broader audience. This hints at the secondary growth phase of cryptocurrency, in which \u201cnon-geeks\u201d get involved. To further the network effect, crypto must both expand horizontally into new countries and vertically into new demographics.\nThus it makes sense for Dogecoin to position itself as \u201cdigital pocket money.\u201d Dogecoin\u2019s creators, initial adopters and big miners have made their easy money. I suggest they invest some of it into innovation if they want Dogecoin to survive. For example, by deliberately weakening the protocol\u2019s anonymity and requiring third-party authorisation, parents could monitor and control their children\u2019s spending. This anticipates a looming media controversy: children using cryptocurrency to buy weapons, drugs and porn online.\nI\u2019m all for financial privacy for adults but, even without accessing the darkweb, the anonymity of crypto allows minors easy access to cigarettes, alcohol and the like. That\u2019s a problem it\u2019s better to confront now. Geeky dads might want to introduce their children to the future of money, but hesitate when the first stories about Little Johnny and Girls Gone Bitcoin start hitting the media.\nDogecoin can carve itself a niche here. Instead of waiting for scraps from Bitcoin\u2019s boardroom table or trying to compete with alts quickly evolving into untraceable shadow-money, Doge needs to limit and simplify its Litecoin feature set.

Gox, 786, and most other successful Bitcoin exchanges all use fiat vouchers in some way, shape, or form. \u00a0Obviously, such a workaround has been incredibly prevalent around the world in different regulatory climates and there\u2019s no reason to think that this is only a temporary solution. \u00a0China\u2019s government has started to make it clear what type of hoops Bitcoin Exchanges and Bitcoiners in China will have to jump through on a regular basis. \u00a0From the rising volume and exchange rate, we can safely assume that Chinese Bitcoiners, and Bitcoiners around the world, are more than willing to deal with vouchers and hoops to get their hands on some Bitcoin.\nIn the past 24 hours, almost half of the total Bitcoin exchange volume has been on BTC China. \u00a0In comparison with the lowered volumes after all major Chinese Exchanges reinstated 0.3% fees on December 18th, the recent spike in Bitcoin volume shows the re-entrance of some Chinese players to the market. \u00a0A closed-door meeting between the Chinese Central Bank and major third-party payment processors in China on December 17th ended direct bank and third party payment processor deposits and withdrawals to Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges. The recovery is not over yet, on news of Chinese exchanges resuming normal operations, the exchange rate has risen over 10% since Christmas.", "category": "Bitcoin Exchange"}

It shows a new Fibonacci retracement of the previous downtrend, the MACD indicator and fractal ^ symbols \u2013 these are historically significant high and low turning points. An explanation of Fib levels and the MACD can be found in Part 1 of my previous forecast. Also shown is my stoploss level, a major Support / Resistance line at $800 and the All Time High.\nMy current trading plan, as well as previous plans, can be seen on my Trading View profile. I\u2019d like to recommend Trading View again, they give you all the charts and tools necessary for Bitcoin trade analysis for free. Charts of the major Bitcoin and Litecoin markets, in a variety of currencies, are available. Finally, many skilled traders share their views and charts there; different perspectives are often helpful in keeping your objectivity.\nI bought in with 1/3 of my trading capital yesterday evening, as price broke above the previous fractal high on strong volume and the MACD gave a bullish signal.\nThis morning, price pulled back to test the breakout line. Such tests commonly occur after important chart and level breaks. What\u2019s somewhat concerning is that price has now passed below the breakout level.\nWe still have an intact uptrend however. So long as price remains above this uptrend line, I remain bullish. There is talk right now of various buying and selling walls going up. Given the low volume, these games may be keeping the bulls at bay for now.\nAnother thing to note on my Bitcoin trade chart is the accuracy of the Fibonacci Retracement levels. Price is currently struggling to pass the 61.8% retracement level, and the lower levels have served as excellent Support / Resistance or pivots.\nDespite the current resistance, I\u2019m holding tight and remain bullish. If the Bitcoin price passes that green Fib line, I believe the next test at $800 will come quickly.\n\u2013\nThis is a part of the Cryptocurrency Investment Club by CryptoCoinsNews.com.\nJoin our FREE and EXCLUSIVE Cryptocurrency Investment Club!

Bitcoin just won the award \u201c2013\u2019s Best Currency of the Year\u201d by Global Post. This is awesome news and could give us a small boost in the positive direction. Hopefully we will win it next year as well. I personally believe that the year 2014 will be the biggest Cryptocurrency year yet to come. Now let\u2019s see :-)\nHere is an excerpt from Global Post:\nAnd the GlobalPost 2013 End of the Year Award for Best Currency goes to: Bitcoin.\n2013 was the year that Bitcoin, a virtual currency traded anonymously via peer-to-peer exchanges, emerged from the shadows of crypto-e-commerce into the global spotlight.\nThis time last year, you\u2019d probably never heard of Bitcoin. It was created in 2009, worth exactly nothing, and then traded at just a few cents on the dollar. At the beginning of 2013, it was still a niche currency, trading for between $10 and $20 and best-known as the currency that fueled illegal transactions on the Silk Road, a deep-web black market website where you could purchase drugs, guns, child pornography, and other things you don\u2019t want on your credit card statement.\nThat\u2019s all changed. Bitcoin has emerged as functional currency and has spawned a speculative investment market.\nThere were lots of reasons to get excited about Bitcoin in 2013. For people concerned about the state of surveillance, it offered anonymity. For people who looked around the world and saw fragile nation-states and failing economies, it promised an alternative means of exchange unbound by borders, regulations, or monetary policies. And for people looking for to make investments in a time of massive technological change, it seemed like the currency of the future: Commercial transactions increasingly happen online. Physical cash and the currencies based in it were starting to seem like outmoded relics.\nForget central banks and ineffective governments.\u00a0Forget the National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Let\u2019s just meet online and use Bitcoin, right?\nBitcoin was suddenly everywhere, it seemed. As it became one of the stories of the year, its value rose steadily, collapsing occasionally and then recovering. WikiLeaks used Bitcoin to work around a financial blockade against the organization, and then raised $12,000 worth of it for the defense of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Bitcoin ATMs became a thing. Richard Branson announced that his private space-travel company, Virgin Galactic, would accept Bitcoin. Newspapers reported stories of people whose bitcoins, purchased long ago for nearly nothing and then forgotten, were suddenly worth massive sums. When US authorities expressed some positivity about the currency\u2019s potential in November its value spiked to $1,000.\n\u00a0", "category": "News"}
